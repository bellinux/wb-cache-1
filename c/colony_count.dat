To measure the intralaboratory variation in mycobacterial <b>colony</b> <b>counts,</b> <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> from duplicate blood specimens collected from 52 AIDS patients with MAC bacteremia were determined. <b>Colony</b> <b>counts</b> ranged from 0 to 50, 000 CFU/ml.

The agreement between the intralaboratory paired specimens, as measured by the intraclass correlation coefficient, was 0. 997. To measure the interlaboratory variation, multiple 10 -ml aliquots from 12 patients were distributed to five institutions and processed within 24 to 32 h by lysis-centrifugation. For the 12 specimens distributed to the five laboratories, two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures revealed no significant difference in an individual patient's <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> between laboratories (P > 0. 2). We conclude that quantitation of mycobacterial <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> by the lysis-centrifugation system is reproducible within and between institutions.

This study aimed to identify the microorganisms present on podiatry clinic curtains and measure the contamination pre and post a standard hospital laundry process. Method Baseline swabs were taken to determine <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> present on cubical curtains before laundering. Curtains were swabbed again immediately after, one and three weeks post laundering. Total <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> were calculated and compared to baseline, with identification of micro-organisms. Results Total <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> increased very slightly by 3 % immediately after laundry, which was not statistically significant, and declined significantly (p = 0. 0002) by 56 % one-week post laundry. Three weeks post laundry <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> had increased by 16 %; although clinically relevant, this was not statistically significant. The two most frequent microorganisms present throughout were Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus and Micrococcus species. Laundering was not completely effective, as both species demonstrated no significant change following laundry. Conclusion This work suggests current laundry procedures may not be 100 % effective in killing all microorganisms found on curtains, although a delayed decrease in total <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> was evident. Cubicle curtains may act as a reservoir for microorganisms creating potential for cross contamination.

To {{determine}} whether (1) a decreased concentration of Lactobacilli allows S. pyogenes to grow; (2) S. pyogenes {{is able to}} grow in the presence of healthy Lactobacillus concentrations; (3) S. pyogenes is capable of inhibiting Lactobacilli. Methods. One hundred fifty patient samples of S. pyogenes were mixed with four different concentrations of L. crispatus and L. jensenii. <b>Colony</b> <b>counts</b> and pH measurements were taken from these concentrations and compared using t-tests and ANOVA statistical analyses. Results. Statistical tests showed {{no significant difference between the}} <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> of S. pyogenes by itself and growth when mixed with Lactobacilli, and no significant difference between the <b>colony</b> <b>counts</b> of S. pyogenes in the four different concentrations of Lactobacilli. Conclusion. The statistical data representing the growth of these two organisms suggests that Lactobacilli did not inhibit the growth of S. pyogenes. Also, S. pyogenes did not inhibit the growth of Lactobacilli...|$|R
