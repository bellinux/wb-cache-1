40|$|Ferroelectrets are {{piezoelectric}} materials {{suitable for}} acoustic {{applications such as}} airborne ultrasonic transducers. Typical ferroelectrets exhibit resonance frequencies in the high kHz to low MHz range. In order to decrease the transducer resonance frequencies to the low kHz range, processes such as gas-diffusion expansion and electric charging were adjusted to cellular films which are initially twice as thick as in earlier studies. The demonstrated film expansion and electric <b>charging</b> <b>lead</b> to mechanically soft cellular structures which show high piezoelectric activities with coefficients up to 130 pC/N. Due to the simultaneously increased film thicknesses, the resonance frequencies are lowered down to about 233 kHz...|$|E

This enables us to introduce an 2 ̆ 01 cover-the-barrier 2 ̆ 01 d model for Cz+ 60 ionization, valid for long wavelength light. Using infrared radiation, we confirm the model and also produce stable, highly charged C 60 reaching C 12 + 60, the highest charge state ever observed. At high intensities and high charge states the internal laser-induced dipole force and rapid <b>charging</b> <b>lead</b> to stress on the molecule.

40|$|Lead acid {{battery cells}} have {{low energy density}} and {{relatively}} low life-cycle, yet because of their cost effectiveness they are still considered the preferred choice by many electric vehicle (EV) developers {{and are likely to}} continue to be so for the next 5 - 10 years. One method of improving the performance of a battery powered EV is to improve the battery charging methodology since EV performance and range is largely determined by the capacity, weight and charge/discharge characteristics of the on-board batteries. This paper describes a method for fast <b>charging</b> <b>lead</b> acid batteries using current pulses of controllable magnitude and duty called ‘pulse charging’. It is used together with constant voltage/current profiles to increase charge acceptance, improve the charging time, and to potentially increase the life cycle of lead acids cells.
