50|$|The {{choked flow}} of gases {{is useful in}} many {{engineering}} applications because the mass flow rate is independent of the downstream pressure, and depends only on the temperature and pressure and hence {{the density of the}} gas on the upstream side of the restriction. Under choked conditions, valves and <b>calibrated</b> <b>orifice</b> plates can be used to produce a desired mass flow rate.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{experimental}} investigation on porous media in feeding system of aerostatic bearings. The experiments were conducted using sintered bronze cylindrical inserts of different length, diameter and particle size. The work outlines {{two types of}} experiments namely: a) the measurement of mass flow rate through single porous resistance with different upstream and downstream pressures; b) the study of pressure distribution, on a pneumatic pad featuring porous resistance feeding system. The set-up used for the former included the device under test, a flow regulator and pressure transducers. For the latter the set-up included the pad under test and a stationary bearing member under the pad to evaluate pressure distribution {{by means of a}} pressure transducer. The immediate objective of the work is to define a fluid porous resistance to be provided on the pad, equivalent to that of a 0. 25 mm <b>calibrated</b> <b>orifice</b> already applied to a similar pad...|$|E
50|$|Fuel is {{introduced}} into the air stream through small holes at the narrowest part of the Venturi and at other places where pressure will be lowered when not running on full throttle. Fuel flow is adjusted by means of precisely <b>calibrated</b> <b>orifices,</b> referred to as jets, in the fuel path.|$|R
50|$|A gas jet, fluid jet, or hydro jet is {{a nozzle}} {{intended}} to eject gas or fluid in a coherent stream into a surrounding medium. Gas jets are {{commonly found in}} gas stoves, ovens, or barbecues. Gas jets were commonly used for light before the development of electric light. Other types of fluid jets are found in carburetors, where smooth <b>calibrated</b> <b>orifices</b> are used to regulate the flow of fuel into an engine, and in jacuzzis or spas.|$|R
50|$|The {{system is}} {{activated}} using a switch in the cockpit. This {{turns on the}} fluid pump, which pumps fluid out of the reservoir, through the ducting and out onto the <b>calibrated</b> <b>orifices</b> on the wing leading edge. As the fluid flows along the airstream (both {{on the top and}} bottom surfaces of the wing), a thin coat of fluid is left that protects the surface from icing. The excess fluid then leaves the wing surface and slides out behind the wing's trailing edge.|$|R
30|$|The ambient airflow {{was driven}} to the test section by a {{centrifugal}} fan. The rotations per minute of the wind tunnel fan and the air speed were controlled by an inverter which provided frequency control with different accuracies: 0.01 and 0.1 Hz. The velocity of the cross flow of air was measured by a pitot-static tube. For measuring the bulk temperatures at inlet and outlet of the tube, two T type thermocouples with accuracy of 0.1 °C were calibrated and inserted into the flow. To prevent the heat transfer between the tube and the outer environment, the steel tube outside of the test section was completely isolated with glass wool. Also, other T type thermocouples were inserted in the reservoir and test section, which controlled {{the performance of the}} heaters and measured the air temperature at the inlet and outlet of the test section. The flow measuring system was a <b>calibrated</b> <b>orifice</b> which was connected to a manometer. The rate of flow which passed through the orifice was calibrated by the orifice equation presented in ASME MFC- 14 M- 2001. For calibrating the orifice, the cylindrical gauge was used and the orifice calibrated with 2 % error. A flow bypass line was used to adjust the flow rate through the test section.|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to the traditional spark ignition (SI), premixed, gasoline-like and compression ignition (CI), diffusion, Diesel-like operation of internal combustion engines, premixed, homogeneous charge, compression ignition (HCCI) operation has also been proposed to improve the fuel conversion efﬁciency and reduce the pollutant formation. To be attractive, the operation in HCCI mode has to be coupled with the other traditional operations, being HCCI in general difﬁcult to be controlled and limited to values of the air-to-fuel equivalence ratio l within a narrow windows set by the lean burn limits with large l and the peak pressure limits with small l. Furthermore, the speciﬁc kinetics of hydrogen makes this fuel more difﬁcult than other hydrocarbons {{to work in an}} engine operating HCCI without assistance. In a recent paper, the design of a 12. 8 L in-line six cylinder turbo charged directly injected heavy duty truck Diesel engine fuelled with hydrogen has been discussed. Conversion of a latest Diesel engine with a novel power turbine has been studied replacing the in-cylinder Diesel injector and glow plug with a hydrogen injector and a jet ignition pre-chamber. The pre-chamber is a small volume accommodating another hydrogen injector and a glow plug being connected to the in-cylinder through <b>calibrated</b> <b>oriﬁce...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{drying process}} of porous media {{is a subject}} of {{scientific}} interest, and different mathematical approaches {{can be found in}} the literature. A previous paper by the same authors showed that the celebrated Martin correlation for hot air jet heat and mass transfer yields different degrees of accuracy (from 15 % to 65 %, increasing at high values of input power) if tested on different fabrics, the remaining conditions being the same. In this paper the fabric drying has been experimentally investigated more in depth. A dedicated experimental apparatus for hot jet drying was assembled and operated, in which a hot jet impinges perpendicularly onto a wet fabric. A <b>calibrated</b> <b>orifice</b> was adopted to measure the jet flow rate, with an accuracy better than 3 %. The drying power was determined by continuously weighing with a precision scale a moistened patch exposed to the drying jet. The effect of the time of the exposure and the initial amount of water has been evaluated for each sample. During the hot jet exposure, the temperature distribution over the wet patch has been observed by an infrared thermo-camera. A mathematical model of water transport inside and outside the fabric was developed, in order to evidence the governing transport resistances. The theoretical predictions have been compared with the experimental results, and showed the necessity to modify correlations and models accounting for fabric propertie...|$|E

40|$|The gas driven {{circulation}} enhancement in an adiabatic air -water loop {{has been}} investigated.

Air is injected into the riser through a nozzle provided with several small radial holes. The pressure drop across the liquid single phase region has been changed by inserting <b>calibrated</b> <b>orifices</b> into the horizontal region. The data show the effect of the air flow rate and pressure losses on the liquid flow rate, void fraction, flow pattern, and recirculation ratio. The air pumping power has been experimentally estimated versus the liquid flow rate and the pneumatic efficiency has been evaluated.

40|$|Jet {{ignition}} and {{direct fuel injection}} are potential enablers of higher-efficiency, cleaner internal combustion engines (ICEs), where very lean mixtures of gaseous fuels could be burned with pollutants formation below Euro 6 levels, efficiencies approaching 50 per cent full load, and small efficiency penalties operating part load. The lean-burn direct-injection (DI) jet ignition ICE uses a fuel injection and mixture ignition system consisting of one main-chamber DI fuel injector and one small jet ignition pre-chamber per engine cylinder. The jet ignition pre-chamber {{is connected to the}} main chamber through <b>calibrated</b> <b>orifices</b> and accommodates a second DI fuel injector. In the spark plug version, the jet ignition pre-chamber includes a spark plug which ignites the slightly rich pre-chamber mixture which then, in turn, bulk ignites the ultra-lean stratified main-chamber mixture through the multiple jets of hot reacting gases entering the in-cylinder volume. The paper uses coupled computer-aided engineering and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to provide better details of the operation of the jet ignition pre-chamber (analysed so far with downstream experiments or stand-alone CFD simulations), thus resulting in {{a better understanding of the}} complex interactions between chemistry and turbulence that govern the pre-chamber flow and combustion...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effectiveness of wind-driven natural ventilation in courtyard and atrium-type buildings, particularly {{in the context of}} ventilative cooling. Courtyard and atrium buildings are currently enjoying great popularity. Perhaps a primary reason for their revival comes from the energy and environmental awareness of the current period, in which courtyard and atrium concepts are emerging as very promising. Wind-driven ventilation {{is one of the most}} basic and probably among the most efficient ways to prevent overheating, and provide cooling in the summer season, especially in humid climates. A review of previous works showed that little attention has been given to the wind-driven natural ventilation capability of these structures, and to the means of maximizing this ventilation. This study was thus aimed to fill part of the gap in this subject. In order to evaluate the wind-driven ventilation effectiveness of these structures, and to examine some of the influential parameters, experimental wind tunnel tests were made. Actual indoor air flows were measured in small replica models of four-storey courtyard and atrium buildings by means of small <b>calibrated</b> <b>orifice</b> plates. A parametric study of the geometry of the courtyard was made in isolation conditions, where the depth and breadth of the courtyard were systematically varied. Several atrium ventilation modes were tested both in isolation and in urban terrains. The tests involved different roof geometries and various roof porosities. The measurements were followed by a discussion on the validity of simple computational methods to predict airflow in atria. The investigation portrayed the importance of some factors, such as the wind orientation rather than the courtyard geometry, for enhancing the flow in these structures. The superiority of some atrium designs over the courtyard types, particularly in sheltered sites, was underlined. The study concluded with a discussion of design guide-lines and referred the reader to an application as an example, describing a simple step-by-step method to estimate the cooling benefits of these structures in a particular site, and making use of the measurement data obtained from the study...|$|E
30|$|The {{experimental}} setup {{involves an}} aeration tank having dimensions 1  m[*]×[*] 1  m[*]×[*] 1  m with a water circulating arrangement through a pipe of diameter 50  mm {{connected to a}} centrifugal pump, a flow regulating valve to control the rate of flow, a <b>calibrated</b> <b>orifice</b> meter to measure discharge of water flowing through pipe, and a thermometer to measure the temperature {{of water in the}} tank. Tap water was used for all the experiments, and the level of water in aeration tank was maintained constant nearly at 0.65  m. Hollow jet aerating device connected to the outlet of vertical pipe was installed at a height of 0.1  m from the water surface throughout the experimentation. The experiments were conducted with jet velocities ranging from 0.7 to 4.77  m/s under a discharge range of 2.3 to 3.6  L/s. Thickness of jet was manually adjusted by scaling the vertical opening between pipe outlet and aerator end. For obtaining the amount of oxygen transferred to water in the tank for a particular jet aerator, a known volume of water was filled in the tank. An estimated quantity of sodium sulfite (Na 2 SO 3) along with cobalt chloride (CoCl 2) as catalyst was added to bring dissolved oxygen level of water in the tank between 1.0 and 2.0  mg/L (Deswal 2008), and a sample of water was taken for initial DO (C 0) measurement. Then, the aerator was allowed to run for a specified period of time. (It was ensured that the device was run for a period (t) that DO of water in the tank does not reach the saturation value at the test temperature, T°C, and the final DO (Ct) was then measured.) Two samples are collected from the tank for final DO determination, and the average DO value of two samples is considered as final DO (Ct). The temperature of water in the tank is measured by a mercury thermometer with a minimum accuracy of ±[*] 0.1  °C. The procedure was repeated for various runs of observations by using different jet aerators. The value of volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient (KLa) was then estimated.|$|E
40|$|A new-generation common feeding (CF) fuel {{injection}} system without rail has been compared with the standard common rail (CR) apparatus for diesel engine passenger cars. The high-pressure pump in the CF apparatus is connected directly to the injectors, and a volume of about 2. 5 cm 3 is integrated at the pump delivery. Experimental tests on solenoid injectors {{have been carried out}} for the CF and CR apparatus at a hydraulic test rig. The dependence of the injected volumes and total injector leakages on the energizing time (ET) of the two systems has been investigated for different rail pressure levels. Furthermore, the measured injected flow-rates of the CF and CR systems have been compared for single and pilot-main injection events. In general, the injection performance of the two systems is very similar, even though the differences occur in the high-pressure transients. The dynamics of the pressure waves changes because the high-pressure hydraulic layouts of the two systems are different, and the propagation and reflection of the rarefaction waves, triggered by the injection events, occur in different ways. A previously developed one-dimensional (1 D) code for the CF high-pressure layout has been further validated by means of a comparison with the experimental data. The effects of either a <b>calibrated</b> <b>orifice</b> installed at the pump delivery or an injector-integrated Minirail on the CF performance have been investigated by means of the model. Numerical parametrical tests have also been conducted on the pump-to-injector pipe length. The additional orifices that can be installed in the high-pressure circuit of the CF are effective, provided their diameter is smaller than the diameter of any other orifice inserted in the injector. Furthermore, the presence of a Minirail within the injector has an impact on the injected flow-rates of small injections, such as pilot, pre, after, and post, and also induces a reduction in the energy stored in the pressure waves. Another relevant active damping strategy of the pressure waves for the CF involves shortening the pump-to-injector pipe as much as possible. Finally, the fluid dynamical transients within the solenoid injector have been discussed for the CF and CR systems. The numerical time distributions of the main variables within the injector are shown to be independent of the presence of the rail in the layou...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} length of run {{and size of}} stream on {{moisture}} distribution in irrigated corn furrows was evaluated by three methods; namely, measurement of irrigation water flowing past three points in selected furrows, measurement of irrigation water added to soil as determined from soil samples, and measurement of variation in yield of corn produced on selected areas within the plot area. This study was conducted on a small area of field number 4 located on the Frenchman-Cambridge Irrigation Development Farm, near Arapahoe, Nebraska. The soil is classified as Hall Silty Clay Loam. The experimental area was divided into six 525 feet long plots of six rows each.

40|$|A prior {{paper has}} {{presented}} a novel {{design of a}} heavy duty truck engine fuelled with H 2. In this design, the customary in-cylinder Diesel injector and glow plug are replaced with a main chamber fuel injector and a jet ignition pre-chamber. The jet ignition pre-chamber is a small volume that {{is connected to the}} in-cylinder through <b>calibrated</b> <b>orifices</b> accommodating another fuel injector and a glow or a spark plug that controls the start of combustion. This design permits to operate the engine in four different modes: traditional compression ignition (CI), diffusion, Diesel-like (M 1); mixed gasoline/Diesel-like (M 2); traditional spark ignition (SI), premixed, gasoline-like (M 3); premixed, homogeneous charge compression ignition HCCI-like (M 4). In the mode diffusion with jet ignition (M 1), an injection occurs in the jet ignition pre-chamber before the main chamber fuel is injected and the engine operates therefore mostly Diesel-like. In the mode mixed diffusion/premixed Diesel/gasoline-like (M 2) an injection occurs in the jet ignition pre-chamber after only part of the main chamber fuel is injected and mixed with air. In the mode premixed with jet ignition (M 3), an injection occurs in the jet ignition pre-chamber after the main chamber fuel is injected and mixed with air and the engine operates gasoline-like. Finally, in the mode premixed without jet ignition (M 4), no injection occurs in the jet ignition pre-chamber and the engine operates HCCI-like.

40|$|The {{instantaneous}} flow-rate in high-pressure pipelines {{of fluid}} power {{systems can be}} predicted by means of refined numerical models, the performance of which should be validated extensively against experimental pressure transients. However, such an approach in complex hydraulic systems can require an advanced modelling of the hydraulic, mechanical and electronic components and can therefore be cumbersome and ineffective. Experimental analysis is valuable to support the fast and complete evaluation of integrated electronic-hydraulic power systems, i. e., reciprocating pumps equipped with sophisticated regulation devices, gasoline and diesel fuel injection apparatus, anti-lock braking systems and traction-control systems. However, {{the state of the}} art only allows the unsteady high-pressure liquid flows in these systems to be characterized in terms of the pressure time-history measured at fixed locations. The situation is particularly critical for volumetric pumps, since the main mission of these components is the high-pressure instantaneous delivered flow-rate and one main aspect concerning the final judgement of their performance is related to the flow-rate ripple, which can only be evaluated approximatel. The selection of the operating principle for the flow-rate measurement in high-pressure pipelines can be considered challenging because miniaturized devices, capable of operating at high-pressure levels and characterized by a superior dynamic performance, are required. Obstruction meters, which relate the fluid velocity to the measured pressure drop across a <b>calibrated</b> <b>orifice,</b> offer steady measurements and are therefore not suitable for transients. On the other hand, positive displacement, turbine, and Coriolis flowmeters cannot generally be used because of their relatively low dynamic response (the cut-off frequency can reach 1 kHz) and their excessive overall sizes. As far as magnetic induction based flowmeters is concerned, they are characterized by high dynamic performance, but these meters require fluids with electrical conductivity as low as 0. 1 S/cm, and diesel oil and gasoline both have much lower conductivity than this threshold. Finally, laser Doppler velocimetry-based techniques, which have been applied to the analysis of fluid dynamic transients in gasoline injection systems ([12]), imply a high initial setup cost, and are only applicable for laminar flows. Furthermore, these measurements require a pipe section made of quartz glass and this technique cannot therefore be applied when the pressure is higher than 100 bar. Flow-rate estimations, based on instantaneous pressure measurements, seem to be the most attractive opportunity, due to the superior dynamic response and the miniaturized sizes of the pressure transducers. Having assessed that pressure wave propagation occurs along a single direction, a mathematical relation exists between the pressure and flow-rate time-histories at any pipe section. On the other hand, the flow rate time-distribution cannot be inferred from the pressure time-history, measured at a single location, when the pressure waves travel back and forth through the pipeline, as usually occurs in engineering systems. An innovative methodology has been developed to evaluate the unsteady flow-rate in high-pressure pipelines, on the basis of the signals from two piezoelectric pressure transducers. A first-order non-linear ordinary differential equation was derived from Euler's momentum balance and mass conservation equations, and was numerically solved to compute the instantaneous mass flow-rate. The flowmeter working principle was validated successfully through a comparison with numerical flow-rate data, which were predicted by means of a reliable one-dimensional model of a CR fuel injection system, and satisfactory accuracy and repeatability of the measurements were proved. However, the flowmeter algorithm required knowledge of the initia...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a {{relatively}} new concept in wave-energy conversion systems: the Anaconda. This device consists basically of a distensible tube, made out of rubber material, which interacts with the incident waves in order to convey the absorbed energy {{to some form of}} power take-off (PTO). In the present case, the bulges inside the rubber tube drive a slug of water towards a vertical shaft referred to as a chimney. The oscillations of the water column inside the chimney induce a pressure oscillation in the pneumatic chamber above that activates an air-turbine. The Anaconda device has been studied extensively by experimental and theoretical means. However, so far, the pneumatic PTO for this device has only been examined within restrictive linear conditions. This study is about a series of 1 : 100 scale model tests of a freely floating Anaconda in a wave flume, under deep and intermediate water regular waves, for a device equipped with a non-linear PTO. In the model, the pneumatic chamber communicates with the atmosphere through an <b>orifice.</b> Three <b>calibrated</b> <b>orifices</b> of different diameters have been tested. The pressure across the orifice is determined from measurements taken of the amplitude of water column oscillations in the system, by applying Bernoulli’s law. These properties are subsequently used for calculating the power captured from the incident waves. Estimates of power output and energy capture width are presented, as functions of wave frequency, while the device interacts with linear and second-order waves.

Very lean mixtures of gaseous fuels could be burned with pollutants formation below Euro 6 levels (in the ultra-lean mode), efficiencies approaching 50 % full load and small efficiency penalties when operating part load.

Two-stroke engines are lightweight, simple to construct, high power- to- weight ratios and offer low cost to manufacture. The main problems with two-stroke engines are emissions and low fuel-efficiency. This research used a two-stroke engine with crankcase scavenging. It also adopted an exhaust reed valve and lamellar intake, accommodating a high pressure direct injector as used in the latest two-stroke gasoline engines. The jet ignition device is replacing traditional spark plug. The main chamber and jet ignition use hydrogen as fuel. The jet ignition instrument is a pre-chamber accommodating a high-pressure injector operated with hydrogen fuel, and an 8 mm racing spark plug. The pre-chamber inside the jet ignition device {{is connected to the}} main combustion chamber through <b>calibrated</b> <b>orifices.</b> Lubrication is performed by selective oil injection where needed, rather than oil mixed with fuel. A two-stroke engine CAD model has been designed by using 3 D CAD software SolidWorks.

The CFD simulations were performed in Star CCM+ to analyse the combustion evolution with hydrogen fuel in the cylinder from exhaust port closure to exhaust port opening.

40|$|A way to {{increase}} the efficiency of positive-displacement air compressor is spraying the lube oil to exploit it not only as lubricating and sealing agent but also as thermal ballast. This work seeks the experimental evidence in sliding-vane compressors by measuring the air standard volume flow rate and the electrical power input of three diverse configurations. The first configuration, taken as reference, employs a conventional injection system comprising <b>calibrated</b> straight <b>orifices.</b> The other two, referred to as advanced, adopt smaller orifices and pressure-swirl full-cone nozzles designed for the purpose; the third configuration utilizes a pump to boost the oil pressure. The laser imagining technique shows that the nozzles generate sprays that break-up within a short distance into spherical droplets, ligaments, ramifications and undefined structures. Tests on the packaged compressors reveal that the advanced configurations provide almost the same air flow rate while utilizing half of the oil because the sprays generate a good sealing. Moreover, the sprayed oil is acting as a thermal ballast because the electrical input is reduced by 3. 0 % and 3. 5 %, respectively, if the pump is not or is present, while the specific energy requirement, accounting for the slightly reduced air flow, by 2. 4 % and 2. 9 %, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Because the {{accurate}} measurement of water plays {{such an important}} part in water management, such structures as weirs, <b>orifices,</b> <b>calibrated</b> gates f and flumes have been developed. These structures provide the means for reasonable measurement of the smaller flows (1 : [...] 100 cfs), but for the large flows (100 - 3, 000 cfs) the current meter, large Parshall flume, and various other flumes are commonly used. Where a permanent structure is required, the most widely accepted and utilized method for measurement of large flows is probably the Parshall flume.

40|$|Backgroundpercutaneous transcatheter {{heart valve}} {{replacement}} of aortic or pulmonary valve is established. Transcatheter atrioventricular valve replacement is been described. We report our experience {{focusing on the}} technical aspects. Methodswe retrospectively review the files of patients who received a transcatheter valve in tricuspid position between 2008 and 2012. ResultsFour patients were found. 3 had a heterograft (conduit of 14 -mm, Sorin 33 et Edwards Perimount 33) and one had {{a connection between the}} RA and the RV infundibulum without a valve. Two patients had tricuspid regurgitation as a primary lesion, one had stenotic valve and the last one a mixted lesion. All successfully received a Melody valve from a femoral access. In patients with stenotic lesion, a predilatation using a high pressure balloon was performed before valve implant. In patients with regurgitation, the landing zone was calibrated using a low pressure balloon. These patients were presented to create a landing zone of adequate diameter. Melody valves were inserted using a 22 -mm balloon catheter in 3 and a 24 -mm in one. All but one were post-dilated. There was no significant regurgitation. The mean gradient across the tricuspid valve felt from 12 to 4. 6 -mmHg. One patient needed an epicardic pacemaker because of AV block following balloon dilatation. One patient required inotropic support and ventilation following the procedure but recovered after few days. ConclusionTranscatheter tricuspid valve insertion is feasible in patients with surgical hetero or homografts after a careful selection. The mechanism of dysfunction must be known. In case of stenosis or mixted lesions, the only question is to know if the stenosis could be relief.

40|$|The {{continuing}} maturation {{of metal}} laser-sintering technology has presented {{the opportunity to}} de-risk the engine design process by experimentally down-selecting high pressure nozzle guide vane (HPNGV) cooling designs using laboratory tests of laser-sinteredâinstead of castâparts to assess thermal performance. Such tests are very promising as a reliable predictor of the thermal-paint-engine-test, which is used during certification to validate cooling system designs. In this thesis, conventionally cast and laser-sintered parts are compared in back-to-back experimental tests at engine-representative conditions over a range of coolant mass flow rates. Tests were performed in the University of Oxford Annular Sector Heat Transfer Facility. The aerothermal performance of the cast and laser-sintered parts is shown to be very similar, demonstrating the utility of laser-sintered parts for preliminary engine thermal assessments. It can be shown that in most situations counter-current heat exchanger arrangements outperform co-current arrangements. This concept, though familiar in the heat exchanger community, {{has not yet been}} applied to hot-section gas turbine cooling. In this thesis, the performance benefit of novel reverse-pass cooling systemsâthat is, systems in which the internal coolant flows substantially in the opposite direction to the mainstream flowâis demonstrated numerically and experimentally in film-cooled HPNGVs. It is shown numerically that reverse-pass cooling systems always act to flatten lateral wall temperature variation and to reduce peak metal temperature by maximising internal convective cooling at the point of minimum film cooling effectiveness. Reverse-pass cooling systems therefore require less coolant than other internal flow arrangements to maintain acceptable metal temperatures. The benefits of reverse-pass cooling can be fully realised in systems with long, undisturbed surface length, such as the suction-side (SS) of a HPNGV, afterburner liners, HPNGV platforms, and combustor liners. Three engine-scale HPNGVs with SS reverse-pass cooling systems were subsequently designed using bespoke numerical conjugate heat transfer and aerodynamic models to satisfy engine-realistic aerothermal and manufacturing constraints. The reverse-pass HPNGVs were metal laser-sintered and tested in back-to-back experiments with conventionally cooled HPNGVs in the Annular Sector Heat Transfer Facility. The reverse-pass HPNGVs are shown to reduce peak engine metal temperature by 30 K and reduce mean SS engine metal temperature by 60 K compared to conventionally cooled HPNGVs with the same cooling mass flow. A physically-based infra-red thermography procedure was implemented which takes into account the transmittance of the external optics, the surface emissivity of the object, the black-body temperature-radiometric characteristics of the camera, and the time-varying surrounding radiance. Failure to account for surrounding radiance is shown to result in an absolute error in overall cooling effectiveness of 0. 05. A new experimental facilityâthe Coolant Capacity Rigâwas developed in order to measure row-by-row, compartmental and total coolant capacity of HPNGVs to a precision of 0. 03 %, over a large range of pressure ratios and mass flows using a differential mass flow measurement technique, bypass system, and <b>calibrated</b> mass flow <b>orifice.</b> A novel method for estimating internal loss coefficients from the coolant capacity measurements has been devised which, uniquely, does not require internal pressure measurement. </p...|$|R
