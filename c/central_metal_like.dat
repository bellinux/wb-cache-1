Light structural <b>metals</b> <b>like</b> beryllium, scandium, and titanium {{have some of the}} characteristics of heavy metals, such as higher melting points; post-transition heavy <b>metals</b> <b>like</b> zinc, cadmium, and lead have some of the characteristics of light metals, such as being relatively soft, having lower melting points, and forming mainly colourless complexes.|$|R
50|$|Doping fullerenes with {{electropositive}} metals {{takes place}} in an arc reactor or via laser evaporation. The metals can be transition <b>metals</b> <b>like</b> scandium, yttrium as well as lanthanides like lanthanum and cerium. Also possible are endohedral complexes with elements of the alkaline earth <b>metals</b> <b>like</b> barium and strontium, alkali <b>metals</b> <b>like</b> potassium and tetravalent <b>metals</b> <b>like</b> uranium, zirconium and hafnium. The synthesis in the arc reactor is however unspecific. Besides unfilled fullerenes, endohedral metallofullerenes develop with different cage sizes like La@C60 or La@C82 and as different isomer cages. Aside from the dominant presence of mono-metal cages, numerous di-metal endohedral complexes and the tri-metal carbide fullerenes like Sc3C2@C80 were also isolated.|$|R

50|$|Some general {{physical}} and chemical properties of light and heavy metals are summarised in the table. The comparison should be treated with caution since the terms light metal and heavy metal are not always consistently defined.

40|$|Closed-open {{structural}} {{transformations in}} flexible metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) {{are of interest}} for potential applications such as separation, because of their complete selectivity for the adsorption of specific guest molecules.
