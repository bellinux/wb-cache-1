40|$|Denervation in wasted hand {{muscles in}} a case of primary <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ectopia</b> without syringomyelia SM ALANI From the National Hospitalfor Nervous Diseases, Queen Square, London UK SUMMARY Wasting of hand muscles and electromyographic changes of denervation {{in a case}} of primary <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ectopia</b> without {{evidence}} of syringomyelia is described. It is suggested that the wasting is due to anterior horn cell damage secondary to grey matter venous obstruction at high cervical cord levels. Hand muscle wasting has been described in patients having primary <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ectopia</b> with syringo-myelia. 5 It has also been described with EMG evi-dence of denervation in cases of high cervical cord compression. 2 5 This communication reports denervation changes in wasted hand muscles {{in a case of}} primary <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ectopia</b> with no evidence of syringomelia. Case report A 19 -year-old trainee bricklayer presented with a 5 month history of weakness and wasting in the muscles of the left hand. He also noticed tingling in the left fingers and left side of the chest when bending his neck. There were no symptoms referable to either cranial nerves or the other limbs. On examination, abnormalities were limited to the left upper limb. Weakness (MRC grade 4 to 4 +) was found in the thenar, hypothenar, interosseous, wrist extensor and flexor, extensor digitorum communis and triceps muscles. Wasting was also noted in these muscles, particularly in the interossei. There were no objective sensory abnormalities in any of the limbs. Reflexes were preserved and symmetrical with flexor plantar responses. There was no evidence of Horner's syndrome, spinal deformities or bruits, short neck or skin lesions. Plain radiographs of the cervical spine were normal. Met-rizamide myelography demonstrated herniation of the cere-bellar tonsils down to C 2 level and atrophy of the mid and lower cervical cord (fig). There was no variation in cord size with changes in patient position. Computed tomograph...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} whether clinical features attributed to <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ectopia</b> could {{be related to}} the severity of the malformation, and if morphological features {{could be related to}} operative outcome, a retrospective study of 141 patients with the adult Chiari malformation was carried out, 81 receiving operative treatment. Morphological parameters derived from preoperative clinical imaging were compared with presenting clinical features and postoperative outcomes. Patients with the most severe cerebellar malformation, defined as descent of the cerebellar tonsils to or below the axis, had disabling ataxia and nystagmus more frequently. Those with brainstem compression had limb weakness and muscle wasting more frequently. Operative outcome was significantly less favourable in patients with severe <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ectopia</b> (12 % improved, 69 % deteriorated) than in those with minor ectopia (50 % improved, 17 % deteriorated). Patients with a distended cervical syrinx had a more favourable outcome than those without. Morphological features help predict operative risk...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Two adult {{patients}} are described with <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ectopia</b> whose presentation at diagnosis was respiratory arrest. Following surgical decompression both patients become self ventilating and now lead independent lives. <b>Cerebellar</b> <b>ectopia</b> is a potentially remediable condition {{and should be}} considered in patients with unexplained respiratory arrest. Arnold Chiari malformation type 1 (ACM I) usually presents in adults with occipital headaches, pain, weakness of the upper limbs, or unsteadiness of gait. ' ' Respiratory problems have been occasionally described in a number of reports. These have usually referred to postoperative abnormalities in ventilatory control, 2 - 4 or infants with ACM 56 We describe two adult patients with ACM I who suffered respira-tory arrest. Case I This 63 year old woman was admitted to hospital with severe respiratory failure, having been short of breath for the pre-ceding 10 days. Thirteen years previously she had presented with a 6 year history of progressive difficulty in walking and a tendency to veer to the right. At that time she was noted to have a broad based gait and both horizontal and downbeat nystagmus. Plain skull radiographs showed minor basilar invagination, but myelography was normal. She remained stable until June 1985 when she presented with a 10 day history of severe occipital pain and breathlessness. There was a shorter history of difficulty in walking, weakness of the arms, dysphagia for solids and regurgitation of liquids. She was cyanosed, and had downbeat nystagmus, an absent gag reflex, and a spastic quadriparesis. Her chest radiograph was normal. She rapidly deteriorated and became unrousable, with shallow irregular respirations and apnoeic periods and required mechanical ventilation. Myelography showed changes suggestive of tonsillar herniation, and this wa...|$|E
50|$|A Type I Chiari {{malformation}} is a {{congenital anomaly}} {{of the brain}} in which the cerebellar tonsils are elongated and pushed down through {{the opening of the}} base of the skull (see foramen magnum), blocking the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as it exits through the medial and lateral apertures of the fourth ventricle. Also called <b>cerebellar</b> tonsillar <b>ectopia,</b> or tonsillar herniation. Although often congenital, Chiari malformation symptoms can also be induced due to physical head trauma, commonly from raised intracranial pressure secondary to a hematoma, or increased dural strain pulling the brain caudally into the foramen magnum. Head trauma increases risk of <b>cerebellar</b> tonsillar <b>ectopia</b> by a factor of 4. Ectopia may be present but asymptomatic until whiplash causes it to become symptomatic.|$|R

40|$|SummaryMorphogenesis {{requires}} the proper migration and positioning of different cell {{types in the}} embryo. Much more is known about how cells start and guide their migrations than about how they stop when they reach their destinations. Here we provide evidence that Rbx 2, a subunit of the Cullin 5 -RING E 3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL 5) complex, stops neocortical projection neurons at their target layers. Rbx 2 mutation causes neocortical and <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ectopias</b> dependent on Dab 1, a key signaling protein in the Reelin pathway. SOCS 7, a CRL 5 substrate adaptor protein, is also required for neocortical layering. SOCS 7 -CRL 5 complexes stimulate the ubiquitylation and turnover of Dab 1. SOCS 7 is upregulated during projection neuron migration, and unscheduled SOCS 7 expression stops migration prematurely. Cerebellar development requires Rbx 2 but not SOCS 7, pointing {{to the importance of}} other CRL 5 adaptors. Our results suggest that CRL 5 adaptor expression is spatiotemporally regulated to modulate Reelin signaling and ensure normal neuron positioning in the developing brain...|$|R
40|$|Dysregulation of Otx 2 is a {{hallmark}} of the pediatric brain tumor medulloblastoma, yet its functional significance in the establishment of these tumors is unknown. Here we have sought to determine the functional consequences of Otx 2 overexpression in the mouse hindbrain to characterize its potential role in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis and identify the cell types responsive to this lineage-specific oncogene. Expression of Otx 2 broadly in the mouse hindbrain resulted in the accumulation of proliferative clusters of cells in the cerebellar white matter and dorsal brainstem of postnatal mice. We found that brainstem ectopia were derived from neuronal progenitors of the rhombic lip and that <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ectopia</b> were derived from granule neuron precursors (GNPs) that had migrated inwards from the external granule layer (EGL). These hyperplasias exhibited various characteristics of medulloblastoma precursor cells identified in animal models of Shh or Wnt group tumors, including aberrant localization and altered spatiotemporal control of proliferation. However, ectopia induced by Otx 2 differentiated and dispersed as the animals reached adulthood, indicating that factors restricting proliferative lifespan were a limiting factor to full transformation of these cells. These studies implicate a role for Otx 2 in altering the dynamics of neuronal progenitor cell proliferation...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{assess the}} neuroradiological {{findings}} {{of children with}} congenital hypothyroidism (CHT) compared to healthy controls (HC). Patients and Methods. Thirty children with CHT, mean age 12. 5 ± 1. 6 years, 14 (44. 8 %) males, were compared with 38 HC mean age 11. 7 ± 1. 7 years, 16 (45. 7 %) males. Clinical {{data were collected from}} medical charts and questionnaires seeking information on family history, birth and perinatal period events, medications, and overall health history. Neurocognitive function was assessed for global intelligence, visual and verbal memory, and executive functioning using standardized tests. Neuroimaging was performed using 1. 5 [*]T magnetic resonance imaging and assessed by two pediatric radiologists. Results. Children with CHT had a similar proportion of incidental findings as did the children in the HC group, at 43. 3 % and 39. 5 %, respectively,. Abnormalities of the sellar region were reported in 13. 3 % of CHT group and 7. 9 % of HC group,. Other incidental findings included <b>cerebellar</b> <b>ectopia,</b> choroidal fissure and pineal cysts, and multiple increased signal intensity foci. Neuroradiological findings were not associated with clinical and neurocognitive abnormalities. Conclusion. Neuroimaging of children with CHT demonstrated a similar incidence of structural abnormalities as in the healthy population.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: IIH is a {{syndrome}} of elevated {{intracranial pressure}} without hydroceph-alus, mass, or identifiable cause. Diagnosis {{is made by}} clinical presentation, intracranial pressure measurement, and supportive imaging findings. A subset of patients with IIH may have tonsillar ectopia, meeting the criteria for Chiari malformation type I but not responding to surgical decompres-sion for Chiari I. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the incidence and morphology of <b>cerebellar</b> tonsillar <b>ectopia</b> in patients with IIH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-three patients with clinically confirmed IIH and 44 age-matched controls were included. Two neuroradiologists with CAQs reviewed sagittal T 1 -weighted MRI in a blinded fashion and measured cerebellar tonsil and obex positions relative to the foramen magnum and prepontine cistern width at the level of the midpons. RESULTS: Nine of 43 patients with IIH and 1 / 44 controls had <b>cerebellar</b> tonsillar <b>ectopia</b> of 5 mm. Five of 9 of patients with IIH with ectopia of 5 mm also had a “peglike ” tonsil configuration. Patients with IIH had a significantly lower tonsillar position (2. 1 2. 8 mm) than age-matched controls (0. 71. 9 mm, P. 05).

5000|$|The {{prevalence}} of congenital Chiari I malformation, defined as tonsilar herniations of 3 to 5 mm or greater, was previously {{believed to be}} in the range of one per 1000 births, but is likely much higher. [...] Women are three times {{more likely than men to}} have a congenital Chiari malformation. [...] Type II malformations are more prevalent in people of Celtic descent. A study using upright MRI found <b>cerebellar</b> tonsillar <b>ectopia</b> in 23% of adults with headache from motor-vehicle-accident head trauma. Upright MRI was more than twice as sensitive as standard MRI, likely because gravity affects cerebellar position.|$|R
50|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} pathophysiological mechanism by which Chiari type I malformations occur is by a reduction or lack of development of the posterior fossa {{as a result of}} congenital or acquired disorders. Congenital causes include hydrocephalus, craniosynostosis (especially of the lambdoid suture), hyperostosis (such as craniometaphyseal dysplasia, osteopetrosis, erythroid hyperplasia), X-linked vitamin D-resistant rickets, and neurofibromatosis type I. Acquired disorders include space occupying lesions due to one of several potential causes ranging from brain tumors to hematomas.Head trauma may cause <b>cerebellar</b> tonsillar <b>ectopia,</b> possibly because of dural strain. Additionally, ectopia may be present but asymptomatic until whiplash causes it to become symptomatic. Posterior fossa hypoplasia causes reduced cerebral and spinal compliance.|$|R
40|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, the {{association}} of a medulloblastoma with a “dural-tail” sign has not been previously reported. A 24 -year-old male developed severe headaches and right-sided dysmetria that worsened over 1 month. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain demonstrated a heterogeneously enhancing lesion in the posterior fossa. The lesion appeared to be tentortally-based and exhibited a characteristic “dural-tail” sign, which is considered pathognothonic for meningioma. <b>Cerebellar</b> tonsil <b>ectopia</b> and hydrocephalus were also present. The presumptive diagnosis of tentorial meningioma was made. The lesion was resected by a posterior fossa approach. At surgery, the appearance of the tumor was inconsistent with the diagnosis of meningioma, and histopathologic evaluation yielded the diagnosis of medulloblastonia. This case and the literature demonstrate that malignant tumors can present with the characteristic MR imaging appearance of a meningioma. This possibility must be considered when treatment is planned, especially if a nonoperative course is favored...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: A 7 -year-old {{girl with}} a history of {{headaches}} and Gorham disease was surgically treated in infancy for Chiari I malformation.

40|$|The {{form and}} {{distribution}} of MRI abnormalities in 114 patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS) have been compared with observations on 53 apparently healthy individuals, 129 patients with isolated focal neurological lesions with which MS often presents (51 patients with optic neuritis, 44 with isolated brainstem lesions and 34 with isolated spinal cord syndromes) and 105 patients with disorders which may be confused clinically or radiologically with MS. The latter comprised 55 patients with cerebral vascular disease (including 7 cases of dementia with diffuse white matter disease), 24 with degenerative ataxic disorders, 8 with <b>cerebellar</b> tonsillar <b>ectopia,</b> 7 with sarcoidosis and 11 {{with a variety of}} other disorders. Periventricular abnormalities were found in all but 2 patients with MS and discrete white matter lesions in all but 12. Characteristically the periventricular changes in MS were irregular in outline. Periventricular abnormalities which were often milder and of smooth outline were seen in 37 / 55 patients with cerebral vascular disease, 9 / 24 with cerebellar degeneration, 5 / 7 with sarcoidosis and in 2 / 3 apparently healthy individuals over the age of 60. The appearances in the 7 cases of dementia resembled those with advanced MS. Cerebellar and/or brainstem atrophy characteristic of the cerebellar degenerations, in the absence of white matter abnormalities, was helpful in making the distinction from MS. Congenital anomalies and tumours in the region of the brainstem and foramen magnum were readily shown. More than half the patients with symptoms attributable to isolated focal neurological lesions had additional lesions at presentation. MS cannot be diagnosed in these cases at presentation, but repeat scans after 5 to 20 months in 25 patients with optic neuritis and 10 with clinically isolated brainstem lesions have shown new lesions in 7 (20 %). The patients with new lesions fulfil the criteria for clinically probable MS (Poser et al., 1983). Measurements of T 1 and T 2 in vivo permitted the distinction of acute from chronic brainstem lesions. There were quantitative differences in T 1 and T 2 between the normal appearing white matter in MS and normal brain. Studies of postmortem brains provided convincing evidence that the MRI abnormalities in MS correspond with plaques. Evidence is adduced to support the view that an important source of the abnormal NMR signals in acute lesions is oedema, and in chronic lesions is gliosis; demyelination per se is unlikely to make an important contribution...|$|R
