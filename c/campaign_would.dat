5|$|In 2016, Newt Gingrich filed a debt {{settlement}} plan document with the Federal Election Commission indicating his 2012 presidential <b>campaign</b> <b>would</b> pay zero dollars toward {{the more than}} $4.6 million in unpaid debts owed to 114 businesses and consultants.|$|E
5|$|Britain's {{enemies in}} {{continental}} Europe had long recognised Ireland as a weak point in Britain's defences. Landing troops {{there was a}} popular strategic goal, not only because an invader could expect {{the support of a}} large proportion of the native population, but also because at least initially they would face fewer and less reliable troops than elsewhere in the British Isles. Additionally, embroiling the British Army in a protracted Irish <b>campaign</b> <b>would</b> reduce its availability for other theatres of war. Finally, French planners considered that a successful invasion of Ireland might act as the ideal platform for a subsequent invasion of Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Except {{for some}} troops left to build, garrison, operate, {{and defend the}} base at Tulagi, however, the {{majority}} of the U.S. Marines that had assaulted Tulagi and the nearby islets were soon relocated to Guadalcanal to help defend the airfield, later called Henderson Field by Allied forces, located at Lunga Point, for it was to be on Guadalcanal where all of the future, crucial, land battles in the Guadalcanal <b>campaign</b> <b>would</b> be fought.|$|E

5|$|Former All Black Jamie Joseph {{was hired}} as coach for the 2011 Super Rugby season, while Jamie Mackintosh {{replaced}} Cowan as team captain. The <b>campaign</b> <b>would</b> {{prove to be the}} franchise's most successful in several years, as they raced out to a 3–0 start including a monumental away win over the Bulls in Pretoria. They remained in playoff contention for almost the entire season, sitting 8–4 at one juncture, before slumping under an injury cloud {{at the end of the}} year to finish 8th on the table.|$|E
5|$|In February 2012 the Standards in Public Office Commission {{published}} the candidates' returns for campaign donations and election expenses. Candidates who receive more than 25% of a quota (i.e. 12.5% {{of the total}} votes; 221,471 votes) at any stage {{are entitled to a}} refund of election expenses to a maximum of €200,000. Three candidates received the maximum refund allowed; the other four had too few votes and received no refund. Only donations above €638 need be reported, making the reported totals less meaningful. Gay Mitchell had stated his <b>campaign</b> <b>would</b> be funded by a Fine Gael members' lottery.|$|E
5|$|On 7 August 1942, Allied forces (primarily U.S.) {{landed on}} Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands. The {{objective}} was to deny the islands to the Japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the U.S. and Australia, and secure starting points for a campaign to isolate the major Japanese base at Rabaul while also supporting the Allied New Guinea campaign. The Guadalcanal <b>campaign</b> <b>would</b> last six months.|$|E
50|$|On August 25, the NEC {{confirmed}} the provisional results, {{announced that the}} second round of the presidential election would take place on September 8, and said that second round <b>campaigning</b> <b>would</b> take place from August 25 until September 6.|$|R
50|$|On 7 September 2014, the Union Election Commission {{cancelled}} the by-election {{because the}} period for <b>campaigning</b> <b>would</b> take place {{too close to}} that of the general elections in 2015 and because the results would therefore not have had any political significance.|$|R

5|$|The 17th {{was first}} {{assigned}} to garrison duty at Fort Stanwix, where Montgomery remained until 1764. In 1764, Montgomery applied to Colonel Campbell and General Thomas Gage for leave {{to return to}} England, as his service in the Caribbean had taken a toll on his health. Gage granted the leave, directing Colonel Campbell to give {{it as soon as}} possible. Campbell, whose officer ranks had been depleted in the Caribbean <b>campaign,</b> <b>would</b> only grant the leave after the upcoming expedition.|$|E
5|$|The Swedes {{were not}} {{popular in the}} regions that Sweden had gained at the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. With the new war going badly, insurgents saw their chance to rise up against the unpopular rule. Swedish response, {{especially}} in Scania, was more subtle than one might believe. An all out terror <b>campaign</b> <b>would</b> have been economically disastrous. Instead small patrols searching the woods were often employed combined with promises of carrots or sticks to the local farmers.|$|E
5|$|The {{refusal of}} the United States {{government}} to take promised military action {{in the face of}} North Vietnamese violations of the cease-fire is also examined as a key to the defeat. Adherents to this claim believed that South Vietnam could have been saved by another U.S. bombing campaign. The conflict between the executive and legislative branches of the American government, already severe before the onset of the Operation Linebacker II in 1972, was only more exasperating during 1975, when a new <b>campaign</b> <b>would</b> probably only have provoked even more Congressional outrage.|$|E
50|$|Many anti-pornography feminists {{supported}} the legislative efforts, but others objected that legislative <b>campaigns</b> <b>would</b> be rendered ineffectual by the courts, would violate principles of free speech, or would harm the anti-pornography movement by taking organizing energy away from education and direct action and entangling it in political squabbles.|$|R
5|$|The Poor People's Campaign was {{controversial}} {{even within}} the civil rights movement. Rustin resigned from the march, stating that {{the goals of the}} campaign were too broad, that its demands were unrealizable, and that he thought that these <b>campaigns</b> <b>would</b> accelerate the backlash and repression on the poor and the black.|$|R
50|$|According to the National Advertising Division (NAD), Miller Coors {{declined}} {{to provide a}} substantive response to the challenge.

The company also told NAD that the TV, radio and digital <b>campaigns</b> <b>would</b> be permanently discontinued {{by the end of}} September 2013.|$|R
5|$|With {{the close}} of the North African {{campaign}} in May 1943, attention then turned to the European theater of operations. Despite a preference amongst some sections of the New Zealand government for the 2nd New Zealand Division to be redeployed in the Pacific theater, it was decided that the division, having served with the Eighth Army throughout the desert <b>campaign,</b> <b>would</b> remain in Europe. Accordingly, in October, the division moved to join the Eighth Army in Italy.|$|E

Having been based in Maadi Camp since early June, the battalion left Egypt on 6 October as part of the division's shift to Italy and reached Taranto three days later.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{downloadable}} content (DLC) {{has been}} released, with more announced, since the game's launch. Expansions include new maps, weapon upgrades and character customization options. The DualShock 3 controller became {{compatible with the}} game upon {{the release of the}} version 1.20 patch. Incognito has stated that any future development on the incomplete single player <b>campaign</b> <b>would</b> only be released as a separate product, and not as an expansion to the current game. Warhawk updates are free, but expansion packs are sold online for a price. Updates are mandatory installations that must be completed in order to play the game. Expansion packs are optional, and the ability to purchase expansion packs is available within the menu of the game itself, as well as through the PlayStation Store.|$|E

25|$|It was {{reported}} on 15 July that the Autonomous and Permanent National Electoral Commission (CENAP) had proposed {{to the government}} that the elections be held on 30 August; candidates would submit their nominations from 17 July to 22 July, and <b>campaigning</b> <b>would</b> begin on 15 August. The government officially adopted those dates on 16 July.|$|R
50|$|At {{least in}} the Archaic Period, the fragmentary nature of Ancient Greece, with many {{competing}} city-states, increased the frequency of conflict, but conversely limited the scale of warfare. Unable to maintain professional armies, the city-states relied on their own citizens to fight. This inevitably reduced the potential duration of <b>campaigns,</b> as citizens <b>would</b> need {{to return to their}} own professions (especially in the case of farmers). <b>Campaigns</b> <b>would</b> therefore often be restricted to summer. Armies marched directly to their target, possibly agreed on by the protagonists.|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1975, members of the North Vietnamese Political Bureau paid {{close attention to the}} military situation in South Vietnam to plan for their next major offensive. On January 8, two days after the Vietnam People’s Army 4th Corps had captured Phuoc Long on the northern edges of South Vietnam’s III Corps Tactical Zone, North Vietnamese leaders agreed to launch an all-out military offensive, in order to win the war. Originally the North Vietnamese leaders expected the <b>campaign</b> <b>would</b> last two years, be completed in 1976, and pave the way for final victory. Their key objectives were to bring military pressure closer to Saigon, annihilate as many South Vietnamese military units as possible, and create favourable conditions on the battlefield so that combat forces could be deployed from their current localities.|$|E
5|$|Despite Cimon's massive victory, {{something}} of a stalemate developed between Persia and the League. The Greeks {{do not appear to}} have pressed their advantage home in a meaningful way. If the later date of 466 BC for the Eurymedon campaign is accepted, this might be because the revolt in Thasos meant that resources were diverted away from Asia Minor to prevent the Thasians seceding from the League. Conversely, as Plutarch suggests, the Persians adopted a very defensive strategy in the Aegean for the next decade and a half. The Persian fleet was effectively absent from the Aegean until 451 BC, and Greek ships were able to ply the coasts of Asia Minor with impunity. The next major Delian League campaign against the Persian would only occur in 460 BC, when the Athenians decided to support a revolt in the Egyptian satrapy of the Persian empire. This <b>campaign</b> <b>would</b> last 6 years, before eventually ending in disaster for the Greeks.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{including}} a Stalwart on the ticket, animosity between the Republican factions carried {{over from the}} convention, and Garfield traveled to New York to meet with party leaders there. After convincing the Stalwart crowd to put aside their differences and unite for the coming campaign, Garfield returned to Ohio, leaving the active campaigning to others, as was traditional at the time. Meanwhile, the Democrats settled on their nominee, Major General Winfield Scott Hancock of Pennsylvania, a career military officer. Hancock and the Democrats expected to carry the Solid South, {{while much of the}} North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans; most of the <b>campaign</b> <b>would</b> involve a few close states, including New York and Indiana.|$|E
50|$|On December 8, 2009, the Holiday Bowl {{committee}} {{announced a}} marketing campaign with fast food franchise Jack in the Box where Jack Box, the fictional Chairman and CEO {{of the company}} and star of its marketing <b>campaigns,</b> <b>would</b> be the Honorary Chairman of the game and the Grand Marshal of the Port of San Diego Big Bay Balloon Parade.|$|R
50|$|A {{few months}} after Asano arrived in Miyagi, the prefectural {{governor}} and {{the mayor of the}} city of Sendai were indicted in bribery charges that shocked the population. With little time to prepare he decided to run for the prefecture where he had grown up. He won, and his grass-roots approach to <b>campaigning</b> <b>would</b> carry him two more terms to the position of governor.|$|R
50|$|Notwithstanding his pro-appeasement <b>campaign,</b> Hogg <b>would</b> {{subsequently}} {{vote against}} Neville Chamberlain in the Norway Debate of May 1940.|$|R
5|$|Hancock and the Democrats {{expected}} {{to carry the}} Solid South, {{while much of the}} North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans; most of the <b>campaign</b> <b>would</b> involve a handful of close states, including New York {{and a few of the}} Midwestern states (national elections in that era were largely decided by closely divided states there). Practical differences between the major party candidates were few, and Republicans began the campaign with the familiar theme of waving the bloody shirt: reminding Northern voters that the Democratic Party was responsible for secession and four years of civil war, and that if they held power they would reverse the gains of that war, dishonor Union veterans, and pay Confederate soldiers' pensions out of the federal treasury. With fifteen years having passed since the end of the war, and Union generals at the head of all of the major and minor party tickets, the appeal to wartime loyalties was of diminishing value in exciting the voters.|$|E
5|$|In 1392, King Richard II of England {{created the}} first in a {{succession}} of Ireland kings of arms. It is unknown why such an office was called into being. Froissart notes the creation of Chandos le Roy d'Ireland, but does not give any clues as to the reasoning. It does, however, fit into the general English policy in Ireland at the time. Richard II sought to re-establish English control in those areas where the native Irish had reasserted their independence. The appointment {{can be seen as a}} necessary part of the preparations for the appointment of the Duke of Gloucester as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1392. Richard intended Gloucester to lead a major military campaign, and such a <b>campaign</b> <b>would</b> have necessitated the involvement of heralds to marshal arms and provide advice and evidence in case of heraldic disputes.|$|E
5|$|In August 1810, the French {{squadron}} on Isle de France (now Mauritius) {{achieved the}} most significant French naval victory of the Napoleonic Wars, when they captured or destroyed four Royal Navy frigates at the Battle of Grand Port. The battle was fought inside Grand Port, one of the harbours of Isle de France into which the French squadrons, dominant in the Indian Ocean during 1809, had been steadily pushed and blockaded by pressure from a British squadron under Commodore Josias Rowley. The British defeat had a noticeable galvanising effect on both the British and French naval commands: both recognised that the <b>campaign</b> <b>would</b> be won by the first to reinforce and resupply their forces. Although the French had achieved a significant victory, the naval bases on Isle de France lacked the military stores and food supplies to repair the battle damage to their ships or supply lengthy raiding voyages against British trade routes.|$|E
50|$|The 24 {{participants}} {{were divided into}} six groups of four each. The teams competed in round within groups and robin, qualifying to the next stage the top four of each shift. The four teams with the worst <b>campaigns</b> <b>would</b> be demoted to 1991 Série C, but no such tournament happened, as CBF decided to include 64 clubs in the 1991 Série B, and cancel the Série C of that year.|$|R
