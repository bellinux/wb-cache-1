5|$|Although The Raft of the Medusa retains {{elements}} of the traditions of history painting, in both its choice of subject matter and its dramatic presentation, it represents {{a break from the}} <b>calm</b> <b>and</b> order of the prevailing Neoclassical school. Géricault's work attracted wide attention from its first showing and was then exhibited in London. The Louvre acquired it soon after the artist's death at the age of 32. The painting's influence {{can be seen in the}} works of Eugène Delacroix, J. M. W. Turner, Gustave Courbet, and Édouard Manet.|$|E

5|$|Let us {{bring up}} women, not {{to aspire to}} {{advantages}} which the Constitution denies them, but to know and appreciate those which it guarantees them... Men are destined {{to live on the}} stage of the world. A public education suits them: it early places before their eyes all the scenes of life: only the proportions are different. The paternal home is better for the education of women; they have less need to learn to deal with the interests of others, than to accustom themselves to a <b>calm</b> <b>and</b> secluded life.|$|E

5|$|Sabina {{got to her}} feet, whereupon a policewoman {{attempted}} to persuade her {{to stay on the}} ground and receive further medical attention.

Emergency workers and several members of the public caught up with her, restrained her and carried her to a waiting ambulance, at which point she was sedated. Ursula was also taken to hospital where she stayed for weeks. Sabina appeared less deranged and more <b>calm</b> <b>and</b> relaxed in police custody.|$|E
5|$|The Finnhorse is also well-suited to riding therapy, being <b>calm</b> <b>and</b> steady, hard-working, obedient, {{healthy and}} enduring. They are {{small enough to}} allow the patient to be {{assisted}} easily, yet large enough to have gaits that stimulate the muscles, senses, and balance of the rider. Many Finnhorses have also been trained for driving, and therefore are familiar with unusual noises and can be controlled from behind, and ex-trotters are inexpensive. Many Finns also find {{the appearance of the}} Finnhorse comforting.|$|E

5|$|After World War I, {{traveling}} {{was once}} again possible for the many young artists who {{had been forced to}} stay home during the six years of war. In 1920, Jolin went on a journey, first to Italy, North Africa and Spain for new international impressions, and then on to India, Africa and the West Indies. In the spring of 1924, Jolin went to Spain with his first wife, Britt von Zweigbergk. Like many other artists he painted the bullfights, but contrary to the strong, and sometimes bloody, bullfight painted by his colleague and close friend Gösta Adrian-Nilsson (GAN), Jolin's works were created in the <b>calm</b> <b>and</b> orderly manner that had earned him his second nickname: Eleganten Einar (Einar, the Elegant).|$|E
5|$|Another Ottoman {{army was}} {{assembled}} in Manastir {{in the summer}} of 1434. Again under the command of Sinan Pasha, this Ottoman expedition was defeated by Gjergj Arianiti in south-central Albania in August 1434. After his defeat, all beys of the territories bordering Albania were ordered to gather their forces and attack the rebels. In December 1434 Ishak Bey, sanjakbey of Üsküb marched into south-central Albania but was defeated by Gjergj Arianiti. Contemporary sources from the senate of Ragusa mention that many Ottoman soldiers were captured, while Ishak Bey escaped with a small group. In April 1435, Arianiti defeated another Ottoman campaign and hostilities virtually ceased until the beginning of 1436, as Murat II's military efforts were focused against Ibrahim of Karaman in Anatolia. At the end of 1435 reports of the Ragusan senate assessed the situation as <b>calm</b> <b>and</b> noted that the belligerents had retreated to their respective territories.|$|E

5|$|Auxois {{horses are}} usually bay or bay roan in color, {{although}} {{they can also}} be chestnut or red roan, similar to the Ardennais. gray and seal brown (the latter called black pangaré by the breed registry, although these horses are genetically brown, not black with pangaré markings) are also accepted for registration; all other colors are excluded. The Auxois is known for its power and docility, having a <b>calm</b> <b>and</b> gentle temperament. Like the Ardennais, it is an easy keeper, able to survive outdoors in all seasons, even in the harsh climatic conditions sometimes seen in Morvan and Nievre.|$|E
5|$|Blackburn {{began his}} {{professional}} film career directing commercials and music videos, and became {{associated with the}} film production company Warp X.

He shot the film on a £1 million budget over 24 days in South Africa.

He went on to serve as writer for the film Vinyan, which critics compared to two films by director Nicolas Roeg, Don't Look Now and Heart of Darkness.|$|E
5|$|During the strike, despite {{considerable}} tensions, {{the city}} of Philadelphia remained mostly <b>calm</b> <b>and</b> there were no major outbreaks of violence. All of the city's newspapers editorialized against the strike and the public was, by and large, opposed to the strike as well. Several of the strike leaders, including James McMenamin and Frank Carney, were arrested for violating the anti-strike act. The NAACP played an active role both in pressuring the PTC {{and the federal government}} to institute fair hiring practices at the PTC for several years before the strike, and in maintaining the calm during the strike itself.|$|E
