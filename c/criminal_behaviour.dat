5|$|The German colony at Madang on Kaiser-Wilhelmsland (the New Guinea mainland) was {{occupied}} on 24 September, although the German armed merchant raider SMS Cormoran—which was lurking nearby—escaped undetected. Over {{the next two}} months the remaining outposts were also occupied. Meanwhile, the German East Asiatic Squadron steamed across the Pacific before surprising and sinking a British force off Coronel on 1 November. After rounding Cape Horn into the Atlantic and attempting a raid on the Stanley naval station, the squadron was itself destroyed by a more powerful British force during the Battle of the Falkland Islands on 8 December 1914. Later it was alleged that widespread looting and destruction of civilian property by Australian troops occurred during this period. Indeed, ill-discipline among the Australian force appears to have been an issue—perhaps due to the haste with which the AN had been raised and the poor character of some of those that were enlisted. Claims in the Australian media of <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviour</b> caused considerable controversy at the time, and later led to a parliamentary enquiry. In the end a number of soldiers were court martialled and imprisoned for looting and theft, although more serious allegations, including rape, also arose.|$|E
25|$|Empirical {{studies in}} {{criminology}} support behavioural change theories. At the same time, the general theories of behavioural change suggest possible explanations to <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{and methods of}} correcting deviant behaviour. Since deviant behaviour correction entails behavioural change, understanding of behavioural change can facilitate the adoption of effective correctional methods in policy-making. For example, the understanding that deviant behaviour like stealing may be learned behaviour resulting from reinforcers like hunger satisfaction that are unrelated to <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviour</b> can aid the development of social controls that address this underlying issue rather than merely the resultant behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Pauline Pearce, a 45-year-old {{woman from}} Hackney, was filmed {{close to the}} rioting, furiously chastising looters over their <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviour.</b> She is seen holding a {{walking-stick}} and gesturing. The resulting Heroine of Hackney video subsequently went viral.|$|E
30|$|About {{the role}} of family structure, a {{specific}} dimension that plays a role is whether the individual comes from a single-parent household, which {{increases the likelihood of}} engaging in risky sex, in <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours</b> and carrying a weapon by 14, 17 and 5 percentage points, respectively. In addition, the number of siblings is positively associated with <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours.</b>|$|R
40|$|It is of {{importance}} to direct resources to prevention since crime is costly both for the offender, possible victims and of society and its citizens at large. In general, prevention programs {{and the types of}} interventions are not well understood. It is therefore of necessity to find and study potential causal mechanisms that could aid and enable better preventive measures. This study investigates such mechanisms by testing one of the key aspects of the Situational Action Theory: the perception-choice process. This study relies on data gathered within the frames of Malmö Individual and Neighbourhood Development study (MINDS). Through scenario research and self-reported crime data the correspondence between criminal intentions and actual <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours</b> are investigated. Relevant personal and situational characteristics are examined in order to provide insights about crime propensity and the role of motivation and controls in intended and actual action outcomes. The result show that Swedish adolescents’ criminal intentions correspond with self-reported actual <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours</b> to a large extent. The result further indicates clear tendencies of correspondence between level of propensity and prevalence of criminal intentions and actual <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours...</b>|$|R
30|$|In Table 6 {{we report}} {{the results for}} the risky {{behaviours}} models including educational aspirations. Keeping everything else constant, in this model we observe that aspiring for higher education reduced the likelihood of engaging in <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours</b> by 23 percentage points. Higher aspirations are also negatively correlated with the total number of risky behaviours. The role played by the other predictors (the same as in the previous model) remains very similar. One noticeable difference is that, once aspirations are controlled for, school enrollment does not predict <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours</b> which suggest that aspirations measured and school enrollment both measured at the age of 15 are strongly correlated.|$|R
25|$|The Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 {{received}} Royal Assent in March 2014. This streamlined {{the tools}} available to tackle anti-social behaviour and replaced the ASBO with an injunction (a civil order) and a <b>Criminal</b> <b>Behaviour</b> Order.|$|E
25|$|The Act {{prohibits the}} {{processing}} of data which relates to children under parental control, or to the religious or philosophical beliefs, ethnic origin, race, trade union membership, political opinions, health, sexual life or <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviour</b> of an individual Section 37(1).|$|E
25|$|Religious {{behaviour}} {{was presented}} in the official propaganda as being linked to psychological disorders and even <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Textbooks for schoolchildren tried to evoke contempt for believers; pilgrims were depicted as morons, repulsive-looking alcoholics, syphilitics, plain cheaters and money-grubbing clergy. Believers were treated as harmful parasites that spread ignorance, filth and disease, and which needed to be liquidated.|$|E
30|$|Finally, keeping {{other factors}} constant, {{we find a}} strong {{negative}} association between school enrollment and <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Also, an increase of one standard deviation in the PPVT test {{is associated with a}} reduction in smoking of 5 percentage points.|$|R
30|$|From {{the factors}} {{previously}} mentioned, gender, age, self-esteem {{and living in}} a single-parent household stand out as factors that systematically predict risky and <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours.</b> These are also the factors that predict the (overall) number of risky behaviours in which the individual has engaged.|$|R
50|$|Forensic Mental Health Science is {{the study}} of antisocial, violent, and <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours</b> among people with mental disorders. The department's {{research}} focuses on antisocial behaviour as it appears in people with either major mental disorders or personality disorders. The department is closely allied to the Forensic Psychiatry Teaching Unit.|$|R
25|$|The anti-religious {{propaganda}} {{attempted to}} show a relationship between religious belief and immoral or <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviour.</b> This included a revision of Russian history, in which religious figures were condemned. Fr Gapon, {{the leader of the}} Bloody Sunday March in January 1905 who was praised by Lenin, was turned into a Japanese spy, and Patriarch Tikhon was alleged to have been affiliated with British capitalists.|$|E
25|$|On November 29, 2012 Ramush Haradinaj {{was acquitted}} a second time. This time, {{due to the}} extreme {{diligence}} of the court and of the parties there was no allegation of witness intimidation. Instead the judges found {{that not only was}} there no evidence to convict Mr. Haradinaj, the Court held that the evidence established that he had acted to prevent <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviour</b> where he could.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{estimate}} that of homeless youth in North America, {{one in three}} has engaged in survival sex. In one study of homeless youth in Los Angeles, about one-third of females and half of males said they had engaged in survival sex. Likelihood increases {{with the number of}} days the youth has been homeless, experience of being victimized, engaging in <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviour,</b> using illegal substances, attempting suicide, being pregnant and having a STD.|$|E
30|$|The four most {{consistent}} predictors of risky and <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours</b> are gender, age, self-esteem {{and whether the}} individual comes from a single-parent household. The {{fact that there are}} differential patterns by gender and age was already evident in the descriptive statistics. The probability of smoking, drinking and engaging in drinking and violence increases respectively by 22, 23 and 25 percentage points for males compared to females. Similarly, males are 13 percentage points more likely than females of consuming drugs and engaging in <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Although the average age is 19, many individual were aged 18 at the moment of the interview. We find that moving from 18 to 19 years old increases the likelihood of smoking, drinking and drinking and violence by around 10 percentage points in all cases.|$|R
30|$|Beyond {{the role}} of gender and age, our main finding {{is related to the}} {{association}} between self-esteem and risky and <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Given that the estimation controls for demographic and socio-economic characteristics, as well as for schooling achievement and time-invariant community characteristics, among other aspects, the estimated parameter can be interpreted as a robust association. Keeping other factors constant, a 1 standard deviation increase in self-esteem at age 15 reduces the likelihood of engaging in smoking, drinking, and drinking and violence by 7, 6 and 8 percentage points (respectively); it also reduces the likelihood of <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours</b> and carrying a weapon by 14 percentage points and 4 percentage points. In contrast, the association with self-efficacy is not statistically significant, though it is interesting to observe that the estimated coefficients have the expected (negative) sign.|$|R
50|$|Threats to the Clinic's {{organisational}} {{and financial}} survival have surfaced {{from time to}} time. At one such juncture, in 1994, it joined forces with the neighbouring Portman Clinic in Fitzjohn's Avenue. The Portman specialises in areas of Forensic psychiatry, including the treatment of addictive, sociopathic and <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours</b> and tendencies.|$|R
25|$|The {{listing of}} {{periodicals}} under permanent banning orders as of 2007 includes many publications which have {{ceased to be}} published, as well as ones which are now sold freely without any realistic chance of prosecution, such as Health and Efficiency and The Weekly News. A {{large proportion of the}} banning orders date from the 1950s or before; and a similar proportion cover true crime publications, a type which were once illegal due to a perceived risk of glorifying or encouraging <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviour.</b>|$|E
25|$|After the {{publication}} of his two-volume study La sociologia criminale in 1889, in which he emphasized the social factors on <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviour,</b> he was virulently attacked by Lombroso and his disciples. The work received a moderately positive response from the scientific community both in Italy and abroad. Lombroso, however, did not allow any criticism by rival scientists and his alleged scientific supremacy. He unleashed a smear campaign and scientific crusade against Colajanni while blocking access to academic journals to prevent Colajanni’s replies.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 Oxegen festival {{was again}} {{the site for}} anti-social and <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviour,</b> despite claims from organisers MCD that {{security}} {{would be much more}} robust that year, after the Irish press picked up on apparent 'rioting' and an alleged stabbing that occurred at Oxegen 2006. However, with the closing of the Oxegen website's forum and an external, unofficial forum set up later, by threat of legal action from MCD, many believe that MCD tried to cover up the problems at Oxegen 2006.|$|E
40|$|Some {{trends in}} {{contemporary}} criminal policies (especially in Italy) are analyzed, focusing on some recent legislative measures and corresponding cultural attitudes towards foreign immigrants. The {{influence of the}} "law and order" mentalities on such policies are discussed and criticized as conducive to "labelling" outcomes, which threat to favour <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours</b> instead of effectively preventing them...|$|R
2500|$|At that time, eugenicists {{argued that}} mental illness, mental retardation, epilepsy, alcoholism, pauperism, certain <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours,</b> and social defects, such as {{prostitution}} and sexual perversion, were genetically determined and inherited. [...] Further, {{it was widely}} believed that persons with these disorders had a higher reproduction rate than the normal population. [...] As a result, it was feared the gene pool {{in the general population}} was weakening.|$|R
50|$|An {{anti-theft}} system is any device or method {{used to prevent}} or deter the unauthorized appropriation of items considered valuable. Theft {{is one of the}} most common and oldest <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours.</b> From the invention of the first lock and key to the introduction of RFID tags and biometric identification, {{anti-theft system}}s have evolved to match the introduction of new inventions to society and the resulting theft by others.|$|R
25|$|Specific {{theories}} {{that have been}} applied to criminology include the social learning and differential association theories. Social learning theory's element of interaction between an individual and their environment explains the development of deviant behaviour {{as a function of}} an individual's exposure to a certain behaviour and their acquaintances, who can reinforce either socially acceptable or socially unacceptable behaviour. Differential association theory, originally formulated by Edwin Sutherland, is a popular, related theoretical explanation of <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviour</b> that applies learning theory concepts and asserts that deviant behaviour is learned behaviour.|$|E
25|$|While Dutch {{society has}} a history of support for liberal values, it has not been immune to what can be {{regarded}} as a broader international trend toward the practice of racial profiling and increased levels of police violence towards racial minorities. Suspicion and mistrust of some racial groups is evident, and is perpetuated by police attitudes at all levels of command. This trend in police behaviour has drawn comment from Amnesty International, which in a 2015 report describes Dutch law enforcement officers as having a tendency to correlate suspicious <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviour</b> with specific ethnic characteristics, most notably those typical of persons of Moroccan heritage. Current political discourse in the Netherlands often supports the notion of inferiority of some cultures and is evidenced by the growth in support for far right political ideologies in recent decades.|$|E
25|$|However {{eighteenth-century}} society {{struggled with}} the relation between drunkenness and responsibility especially when crime was involved. On one hand, {{it was believed that}} intoxication could alter a person's nature leading him to <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviour,</b> and consequently the judges and jurors were inclined to be tolerant towards these infractions. On the other hand, both citizens and law authorities shared the opinion that drunkenness was an unacceptable excuse, so if a crime was committed in such a state the felon must be fully prosecuted. With the harsh punishments of the Bloody Code pending on the head of the offender, English judges and jurors were usually willing to admit a plea for drunkenness. It was often regarded as an extenuating circumstance and most frequently resulted in the possibility of mitigation, acquittal, or pardon.|$|E
30|$|Third, {{and perhaps}} most importantly, we find a {{negative}} correlation between psychosocial competencies and risky behaviours. Keeping everything else constant, an improvement of 1 standard deviation in self-esteem {{at the age of}} 15 is associated with a reduction of 7, 6 and 8 percentage points respectively in the probability of smoking, drinking and engaging in violent behaviours while drinking at the age of 19. It is also associated with a reduction in the prevalence of <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours</b> and in the possession of a weapon by 14 and 5 percentage points, respectively. No similar correlation is found with self-efficacy. These results are robust to a large set of controls at the child and household level, and to community characteristics that are fixed over time. Moreover, child fixed effects estimates show that these associations persist once controlling for time-invariant unobservable characteristics. We note further that early self-esteem, measured at the age of 12 is already a predictor of later drugs consumption, unprotected sex, <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours</b> and the number of risky behaviours the adolescents engage with at the age of 19.|$|R
30|$|Finally, we {{find that}} {{aspiring}} to higher education {{at the age of}} 15 reduces the probability of engaging in <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours</b> at the age of 19 by 23 percentage points. Furthermore, while on average girls are more at risk of unprotected sex, girls aspiring to higher education are less likely to have unprotected sex. Nevertheless, once we control for unobservable individual characteristics the correlation between aspirations and risky behaviours is no longer significant.|$|R
40|$|On October 1 st, {{we began}} to look at current {{services}} offered for sex offenders and individuals with deviant sexual behaviours {{in order to make}} a recommendation of a local service for this clientele. Our mandate was to review existing services being offered, up-to-date research on treatment options, treatment programs available and consultations with local professionals in the field. Barriers to individuals wanting treatment but scared of the criminal repercussions if they disclosed their <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours</b> were also considered...|$|R
25|$|Some historians, like David Arnold, have {{suggested}} that it so happened because many of these tribes were simply small communities of low-caste and nomadic people living {{on the fringes of}} the society upon rudimentary subsistence, often wandering to survive as petty traders, pastoralists, gypsies, hill and forest dwelling tribes, which did not conform to the British colonial idea of civilised living, of settled agriculture and waged labour. The trouble came, however, when criminality or professional <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviour</b> was taken to be hereditary rather than habitual, that is when crime became ethnic, and what was merely social determinism till then became biological determinism. This paradigm shift seems to have arisen out of the prevalent belief in 19th century Europe that people with peripatetic lifestyles usually were a menace to society and required control or at least surveillance. Elsewhere the concept of Reformatory Schools for such people had already been initiated by mid-19th century by social reformers.|$|E
500|$|Hornung {{returned}} to England in February 1886, before {{the death of}} his father in November. From a position of relative prosperity, John's coal and iron business had encountered difficulties and he was in financially straitened circumstances by the time of his death. Hornung found work in London as a journalist and story writer, often publishing his work under a pseudonym, although in 1887 he published his first story under his own name, [...] "Stroke of Five", which appeared in Belgravia magazine. His work as a journalist was during the period of Jack the Ripper and the series of five murders, which were undertaken against a background of rising urban crime in London; it was around this time that Hornung developed an interest in <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviour.</b>|$|E
500|$|Like Hornung's first novel, Tiny Luttrell [...] had Australia as a {{backdrop}} [...] and also used the plot device of an Australian woman in a culturally alien environment. The Australian theme was present in his next four novels: The Boss of Taroomba (1894), The Unbidden Guest (1894), Irralie's Bushranger (1896) and The Rogue's March (1896). In the last of these Hornung wrote of the Australian convict transport system, and showed evidence of a [...] "growing fascination with the motivation behind <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviour</b> and a deliberate sympathy for the criminal hero {{as a victim of}} events", while Irralie's Bushranger introduced the character Stingaree, an Oxford-educated, Australian gentleman thief, in a novel that [...] "casts doubt on conventional responses" [...] to a positive criminal character, according to Hornung's biographer, Stephen Knight.|$|E
30|$|These are {{our main}} findings. First, {{we find that}} the {{prevalence}} of risky behaviours is evident and increases significantly over time: by age 15, two out of 10 individuals had engaged in at least one risky behaviour, whereas by age 19 one out of two had. By age 19, the prevalence of smoking and drinking is 19 and 34 %, respectively; 13 % had consumed illegal drugs, 27 % had had unprotected sex and 19 % had engaged in <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours.</b>|$|R
30|$|To summarize, {{the fixed}} effects {{estimates}} {{show that the}} relationship between self-esteem and risky behaviours is very robust, whereas the relationship between self-efficacy, aspirations and risky behaviours is not. In addition, {{there seems to be a}} lot of meaningful variation over time in the control variables, which allows us to show that coming from a single-parent household, area of location, migration and schooling achievement are also important factors that play a role in the determination of risky and <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours.</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{adolescent}} offenders, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and its dimensions/subtypes {{have been}} frequently ignored {{due to the}} stronger focus on <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours.</b> The revised criteria of the DSM- 5 now allow diagnosing ODD in older youths independent of conduct disorder (CD). This study aimed at analysing ODD dimensions/subtypes and their relation to suicidality, comorbid psychiatric disorders, and <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours</b> after release from detention {{in a sample of}} detained male adolescents. METHODS: Suicidality and psychiatric disorders (including ODD symptoms) were assessed in a consecutive sample of 158 male adolescents (Mage  =  16. 89  years) from the Zurich Juvenile Detention Centre. Based on previous research findings, an irritable ODD dimension and a defiant/vindictive ODD dimension based on ODD symptoms were defined. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was used to identify distinct subtypes of adolescent offenders according to their ODD symptom profiles. Logistic regression and Cox regression were used to analyse the relations of ODD dimensions/ODD subtypes to comorbid psychopathology and criminal reoffenses from official data. RESULTS: The ODD-irritable dimension, but not the ODD defiant/vindictive dimension predicted comorbid anxiety, suicidality and violent reoffending. LCA identified four subtypes, namely, a no-ODD subtype, a severe ODD subtype and two moderate ODD subtypes with either defiant or irritable symptoms. The irritable ODD subtype and the severe ODD subtype were related to suicidality and comorbid affective/anxiety disorders. The irritable ODD subtype was the strongest predictor of criminal (violent) reoffending even when controlling for CD. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings confirm the presence of ODD dimensions/subtypes in a highly disturbed adolescent offender sample. Irritable youths were at risk of suicide and persistent <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Due to the severe consequences of irritability, a standardized assessment approach and a specific treatment is needed in prison to prevent suicide among the detainees and further harm to the society. As defined in the DSM- 5, the present findings confirm the validity of ODD and ODD dimensions/subtypes as a diagnostic category among older youths...|$|R
