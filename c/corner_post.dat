25|$|But little {{reference}} {{can be made}} to {{the domestic}} side of the period which ended with the dawn of the 16th century, because so few remains exist. At Bayeux, Bourges, Reims and preeminently Rouen, we see by the figures of saints, bishops or virgins, how much the religious feeling of the Middle Ages entered into the domestic life. In England the carved <b>corner</b> <b>post</b> (which generally carried a bracket at the top to support the overhanging storey) calls for comment. In Ipswich, there are several such posts. On one house near the river, that celebrated subject, the fox preaching to geese, is carved in graphic allusion to the dissemination of false doctrine.|$|E
25|$|Check hook : A check hook is {{employed}} to prevent aggressive boxers from lunging in. There are two parts to the check hook. The first part {{consists of a}} regular hook. The second, trickier part involves the footwork. As the opponent lunges in, the boxer should throw the hook and pivot on his left foot and swing his right foot 180 degrees around. If executed correctly, the aggressive boxer will lunge in and sail harmlessly past his opponent like a bull missing a matador. This is rarely seen in professional boxing as it requires a great disparity in skill level to execute. Technically speaking {{it has been said}} that there is no such thing as a check hook and that it is simply a hook applied to an opponent that has lurched forward and past his opponent who simply hooks him on the way past. Others have argued that the check hook exists but is an illegal punch due to it being a pivot punch which is illegal in the sport. Floyd Mayweather, Jr. employed the use of a check hook against Ricky Hatton, which sent Hatton flying head first into the <b>corner</b> <b>post</b> and being knocked down.|$|E
500|$|Manampisoa, {{also called}} Lapasoa ("Beautiful Palace"), {{was a small}} villa {{in the form of}} a cross {{designed}} by James Cameron for Queen Rasoherina. Construction was overseen by William Pool. After the first <b>corner</b> <b>post</b> of the building was raised on 25 April 1865, work continued for two years before Manampisoa was complete. Measuring approximately [...] long, [...] wide and [...] high, the structure was built using traditional vertical wood wall boards topped by a wooden roof and featured sliding windows protected by heavy wooden shutters. It was built on a site formerly occupied by the wooden house called Marivolanitra, which was relocated to Mahazoarivo to make room for the new building.|$|E

2500|$|The {{height of}} his success was when he captained France on the 1951 tour of Australasia. They won the Test series against Australia with Aubert kicking 18 goals from 18 attempts, a record never since topped by any tourist. The {{opposition}} halfback in that series Keith Holman {{would go on to}} state [...] "I've never seen his equal, A terrific player and a terrific gentleman. As a goalkicker he had no equal – and no one since can compare. One day at practice on the Sydney Cricket Ground I saw him do something I've never before or since. He placed the ball where the <b>corner</b> <b>post</b> usually stands and with a remarkable kick curved it around between the goalposts for a `goal'".|$|E
2500|$|Boxing at {{that time}} was very {{different}} from the boxing of today. [...] There were few rules. [...] There was no boxing organization to oversee the sport or lay down regulations or procedures. [...] There was no formal end to the fights: [...] they would go on until one fighter was unable to continue or would give up. [...] A now obsolete practice was that of the seconds. The seconds would wait in the ring during the fight, and assist the boxer between rounds. [...] There were no restrictions regarding fight tactics. [...] For example, a fighter could hit his opponent's head off a <b>corner</b> <b>post,</b> or wrestle his opponent to the ground, or pull his hair, or wrap his arm around his neck in a choking motion and then hit him in the face with the other hand. [...] The fights were very severe and often brutal, and they would continue until the end.|$|E
2500|$|This is {{the fourth}} oldest {{complete}} church in Virginia preceded by Newport Parish in Smithfield 1680, York-Hampton Parish Church (Grace Church) 1697, and St. Peter’s in New Kent County 1701. The original part of the present building can be assigned a date of 1706 according to a dating brick in the south east wall. [...] The north wing was most likely erected circa 1725. It is the second church on this site; the earlier building was a wooden structure of “oak timbers, sheathed with clapboards.”. Curiously, parts of the wooden structure, including a <b>corner</b> <b>post</b> inside the east gable and {{a portion of a}} beam were found embedded in the walls. It has been suggested with no real proof that the brick walls were erected around the frame of the earlier wooden one, essentially encasing it. It is far more likely that some wooden elements of the earlier church were re-used {{in the construction of the}} present brick edifice.|$|E

60|$|There {{are women}} who cannot grow alone as {{standard}} trees;--for whom the support and warmth of some wall, some paling, some post, is absolutely necessary;--who, in their growth, will bend and incline themselves towards some such prop for their life, creeping with their tendrils along the ground till they reach it when the circumstances of life have brought no such prop within their natural and immediate reach. Of most women it may be {{said that it would}} be well for them that they should marry,--as indeed of most men also, seeing that man and wife will each lend the other strength, and yet in lending lose none; but to the women of whom I now speak some kind of marriage is quite indispensable, and by them some kind of marriage is always made, though the union is often unnatural. A woman in want of a wall against which to nail herself will swear conjugal obedience sometimes to her cook, sometimes to her grandchild, sometimes to her lawyer. Any standing <b>corner,</b> <b>post,</b> or stump, strong enough to bear her weight will suffice; but to some standing <b>corner,</b> <b>post,</b> or stump, she will find her way and attach herself, and there will she be married.|$|E
60|$|He {{stopped a}} few moments by the last stake, feeling that he could now return to camp, but still irresolute. It would be dark for some time yet and {{mischief}} might be on foot. Then it dawned on him that the Allinson claims would be better worth attacking than his, and he moved toward the <b>corner</b> <b>post,</b> which {{was the key to}} their position. Their safety was no direct concern of his, and he was getting wet; but Carnally was his friend and Allinson was held in much esteem at the Landing as a just and considerate employer. With difficulty he found the post, which seemed to have been undisturbed; but he felt suspicious and reluctant to leave the spot. Finding a hollow to lee of a rock, he sat down.|$|E
60|$|The {{proceedings}} {{might have}} opened by an impromptu bye-battle between the indignant cockney and {{the gentleman from}} Bristol, but a prolonged roar of applause broke in upon their altercation. It {{was caused by the}} appearance in the ring of Crab Wilson, followed by Dutch Sam and Mendoza carrying the basin, sponge, brandy-bladder, and other badges of their office. As he entered Wilson pulled the canary-yellow handkerchief from his waist, and going to the <b>corner</b> <b>post,</b> he tied {{it to the top of}} it, where it remained fluttering in the breeze. He then took a bundle of smaller ribands of the same colour from his seconds, and walking round, he offered them to the noblemen and Corinthians at half-a-guinea apiece as souvenirs of the fight. His brisk trade was only brought to an end by the appearance of Harrison, who climbed in a very leisurely manner over the ropes, as befitted his more mature years and less elastic joints. The yell which greeted him was even more enthusiastic than that which had heralded Wilson, and there was a louder ring of admiration in it, for the crowd had already had their opportunity of seeing Wilson's physique, whilst Harrison's was a surprise to them.|$|E
50|$|The {{outer walls}} of the {{building}} were of so-called stave-construction, as in palisade churches and later stave churches, with strong <b>corner</b> <b>posts.</b> The technique can be recognized from the preserved remnants of palisade churches in Lund dating to about 1050. The tops of the vertical posts or staves must have been slotted into a horizontal log or wall plate, called a lejd in Swedish (stavlægje in Norwegian), which was seated on the <b>corner</b> <b>posts.</b> The deep trench in which the staves were sunk together with the deep holes for the <b>corner</b> <b>posts</b> indicate that the outer walls must have been high. The purpose of the holes was to resist the lateral pressures so that the walls did not collapse. In Hemse stave church, Gotland, wall staves three meters long were found preserved from the early timber church. An above-ground height of up to four meters for the outer {{walls of the}} hof is therefore not impossible.|$|R
