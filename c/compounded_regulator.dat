Runtime: 55 : 39 minutesKinases are highly regulated enzymes with diverse mechanisms controlling their catalytic output. Inhibitor discovery efforts for kinases have produced ATP-competitive <b>compounds,</b> allosteric <b>regulators,</b> irreversible binders, and highly specific inhibitors. These distinct classes of small molecules have revealed many novel aspects about kinase-mediated signaling and some have progressed from simple tool compounds into clinically validated therapeutics. My presentation will explore several small-molecule inhibitors for kinases highlighting elaborate mechanisms by which kinase function is modulated. A complete surprise of targeted kinase drug discovery has been discovery of ATP-competitive inhibitors that behave as agonists, rather than antagonists, of their direct kinase target. These studies hint at a connection between ATP binding site occupancy and networks of communication that are independent of kinase catalysis. Indeed, kinase inhibitors have been found that induce changes in protein localization, protein-protein interactions, and even enhancement of catalytic activity of the target kinase. The relevance of these findings to the therapeutic efficacy of kinase inhibitors and to the future identification of new classes of drug targets will be discussed...|$|R

It is estimated that the worldwide consumption of pharmaceuticals exceed 1000 tons per year. The consumption of each therapeutic group may vary depending on whether the sale is restricted to a medical prescription, such is antidepressants, or can be purchased freely in the counter as the case of anti-inflammatory drugs. After their consumption and/or use, these compounds are released into the environment via urine and faeces either in its original form as well as metabolites and degradation products. Then, these compounds can be transported through the municipal drainage system and distributed in surface water and groundwater in variable concentrations ranging from ng/L to µg/L. Their presence in the aquatic environment is mainly due to the fact that conventional treatments in the sewage treatment plants (STPs) do not remove these compounds efficiently. Therefore, municipal wastewater is considered as the most relevant emission source of pharmaceutical compounds. By contrast, these compounds can be detected in drinking water, although there are evidences of the presence of some of these compounds in very low concentrations, in the order of ng/L...|$|R

Although {{the presence of}} CS-like compounds in animal tissues has been established, their physiological role is not evident. In the present study, treatment of human NT 2 cells with physiological concentrations (nanomolar) of CSs caused the accumulation of large vesicles adjacent to the nucleus. Experiments using N-(3 -triethylammonium propyl) - 4 -(dibutilamino) styryl-pyrodinum dibromide, transferrin, low-density lipoprotein, and selected anti-transferrin receptor and Rab protein antibodies revealed that CSs induced changes in endocytosis-dependent membrane traffic.

Furthermore, our results support the notion that the CS-induced changes in membrane traffic is mediated by the Na+, K+-ATPase.

Low-impact methods of pest control and plant growth promotion (PGP) are required to enable sustainable agronomic intensification. Trichoderma hamatum GD 12 simultaneously possess both PGP and biocontrol abilities, making it a suitable alternative for polluting agrochemicals. Co-culturing of GD 12 with the plurivorous pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum has shown enhancement of PGP activities. It is hypothesized that during pathogenic interactions GD 12 secondary metabolite gene clusters - which are standardly quiescent – are activated allowing the production of novel PGP <b>compounds.</b> The global <b>regulator</b> methyltransferease, LaeA, forms a trimeric complex with velvet proteins VeA and VelB.

Small molecule screens using whole organisms have high potential to identify biologically relevant targets, yet currently available assays for in vivo peripheral nerve regeneration are either very laborious and/or require complex technology. Here we {{take advantage of the}} optical transparency of larval zebrafish to develop a simple and fast pectoral fin removal assay that measures peripheral nerve regeneration in vivo. Twenty-four hours after fin amputation we observe robust and stereotyped nerve regrowth at the fin base. Similar to laser mediated nerve transection, nerve regrowth after fin amputation requires Schwann cells and FGF signaling, confirming that the fin amputation assay identifies pathways relevant for peripheral nerve regeneration. From a library of small molecules with known targets, we identified 21 compounds that impair peripheral nerve regeneration. Several of these <b>compounds</b> target known <b>regulators</b> of nerve regeneration, further validating the fin removal assay. Twelve of the identified compounds affect targets not previously known to control peripheral nerve regeneration. Using a laser-mediated nerve transection assay we tested ten of those compounds and confirmed six of these compounds to impair peripheral nerve regeneration: an EGFR inhibitor, a glucocorticoid, prostaglandin D 2, a retinoic acid agonist, an inhibitor of calcium channels and a topoisomerase I inhibitor. Thus, we established a technically simple assay to rapidly identify valuable entry points into pathways critical for vertebrate peripheral nerve regeneration...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{hallmark}} of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia is a dysfunction of parvalbumin-expressing fast-spiking interneurons, which are essential for the coordination of neuronal synchrony during sensory and cognitive processing. Oxidative stress as observed in schizophrenia affects parvalbumin interneurons. However, it is unknown whether the deleterious effect of oxidative stress is particularly prevalent during specific developmental time windows. METHODS: We used mice with impaired synthesis of glutathione (Gclm knockout [KO] mice) to investigate the effect of redox dysregulation and additional insults applied at various periods of postnatal development on maturation and long-term integrity of parvalbumin interneurons in the anterior cingulate cortex. RESULTS: A redox dysregulation, as in Gclm KO mice, renders parvalbumin interneurons but not calbindin or calretinin interneurons vulnerable and prone to exhibit oxidative stress. A glutathione deficit delays maturation of parvalbumin interneurons, including their perineuronal net. Moreover, an additional oxidative challenge in preweaning or pubertal but not in young adult Gclm KO mice reduces the number of parvalbumin-immunoreactive interneurons. This effect persists into adulthood and can be prevented with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. CONCLUSIONS: In Gclm KO mice, early-life insults inducing oxidative stress are detrimental to immature parvalbumin interneurons and have long-term consequences. In analogy, individuals carrying genetic risks to redox dysregulation would be potentially vulnerable to early-life environmental insults, during the maturation of parvalbumin interneurons. Our data support {{the need to develop}} novel therapeutic approaches based on antioxidant and redox <b>regulator</b> <b>compounds</b> such as N-acetylcysteine, which could be used preventively in young at-risk subjects...|$|R
40|$|Fabry {{disease is}} a {{lysosomal}} storage disorder caused by loss of α-galactosidase function. More than 500 Fabry disease mutants have been identified, the majority of which are structurally destabilized. A therapeutic strategy under development for lysosomal storage diseases consists of using pharmacological chaperones to stabilize {{the structure of the}} mutant protein, thereby promoting lysosomal delivery over retrograde degradation. The substrate analog 1 -deoxygalactonojirimycin (DGJ) has been shown to restore activity of mutant α-galactosidase and is currently in clinical trial for treatment of Fabry disease. However, only ∼ 65 % of tested mutants respond to treatment in cultured patient fibroblasts, and the structural underpinnings of DGJ response remain poorly explained. Using computational modeling and cell culture experiments, we show that the DGJ response is negatively affected by protein aggregation of α-galactosidase mutants, revealing a qualitative difference between misfolding-associated and aggregation-associated loss of function. A scoring function combining predicted thermodynamic stability and intrinsic aggregation propensity of mutants captures well their aggregation behavior under overexpression in HeLa cells. Interestingly, the same classifier performs well on DGJ response data of patient-derived cultured lymphoblasts, showing that protein aggregation is an important determinant of chemical chaperone efficiency under endogenous expression levels as well. Our observations reinforce the idea that treatment of aggregation-associated loss of function observed for the more severe α-galactosidase mutants could be enhanced by combining pharmacological chaperone treatment with the suppression of mutant aggregation, e. g. via proteostatic <b>regulator</b> <b>compounds</b> that increase cellular chaperone expression. status: publishe...|$|R

Millions of people worldwide {{are exposed to}} inorganic arsenic via drinking water, and more recently also via contaminated food, in particular rice. Many {{studies have focused on}} exploring the adverse health effects of arsenic as well as its mode of action once entering the body. Still, {{little is known about the}} intracellular processes that drive arsenic toxicity. In the present thesis we investigated the effects of arsenic on transcriptional and epigenetic processes both in normal and cancer cell lines. In order to understand how exogenous <b>compounds</b> affect transcriptional <b>regulators</b> such as MAML 1, which is involved in many different signaling pathways and has been related to developmental processes and human diseases (e. g. cancer), it’s important to understand which cellular processes regulate the protein levels. Consequently, we studied the transcriptional co-activator MAML 1 and the ubiquitination and degradation process. We show that MAML 1 protein levels are regulated via ubiquitination and that this process is enhanced by p 300 and repressed by N 1 ICD. On top of that, we also investigated MAML 1 involvement in cell proliferation and epigenetic regulation as well as arsenic effect on MAML 1 expression and kidney cell proliferation. We show that MAML 1 interacts with DNMT 1 and PCNA, both members of the DNMT 1 -PCNA-HDAC 2 repressive complex, which is involved in epigenetic regulation. We further report that arsenic decreases kidney cell proliferation and we suggest this occurs via MAML 1 downregulation. In order to further explore the effects of arsenic on the epigenome, we studied arsenic exposure in relation to the post-translational histone modifications (PTHMs) H 3 K 9 me 3 and H 3 K 9 Ac in lymphocytes isolated from exposed individuals as well as in vitro in cell culture system. We report arsenic-related changes in H 3 K 9 me 3 epigenetic mark in CD 4 + lymphocytes isolated from the arsenic exposed individuals and changes in H 3 K 9 Ac in in vitro cultured T lymphoblasts exposed to arsenic. In conclusion, our data suggest that MAML 1 protein levels are regulated via ubiquitination, a process that could also be targeted by arsenic and in this way influence gene expression. Moreover, we suggest that arsenic regulates MAML 1 protein levels and could thereby also influence the cell signaling pathways depending on MAML 1 transcriptional activity. Arsenic also targets epigenetic processes by altering the global levels of H 3 K 9 me 3 and H 3 K 9 Ac in lymphocytes, which could lead to adverse health effects in the human population...|$|R

It documents most of the work produced by INL, ANL, and SNL personnel under their Simulation, Evaluation, and Trade Study (SETS) work packages during FY 2005 and the first half of FY 2006. This report represents the first attempt to calculate a full range of metrics, covering all four AFCI program objectives - waste management, proliferation resistance, energy recovery, and systematic management/economics/safety - using a combination of "static" calculations and a system dynamic model, DYMOND. In many cases, we examine the same issue both dynamically and statically to determine the robustness of the observations. All analyses are for the U. S. reactor fleet. This is a technical report, not aimed at a policy-level audience. A wide range of options are studied to provide the technical basis for identifying the most attractive options and potential improvements. Option improvement could be vital to accomplish before the AFCI program publishes definitive cost estimates.

This lack of response might be related to the fact that immature grain of corn {{has been shown to be}} a source with high concentration of plant growth substances, therefore, it seems unlikely that exogenously applied hormones could have affected the processes of ear growth and development;Despite the significant effect of BA, GA and the low concentration of IAA or NAA in increasing the growth of the second ear, the basipetal pattern of ear shoot development was evident by the decrease in ear size from the top ear downward;The effect of growth <b>regulator</b> <b>compounds</b> on the third ear was similar to that on the second ear, and although they stimulated development of the third ear, they were not able to transfer the third ear from a nonfunctional form to a functional form;In field A a significant increase in leaf width and weight per ear was noticed due to ACA compared to ACE. The results in Field B showed an increase in height of plants and weight per ear with ACA treated plants. The increase in weight per ear due to ACA was to the extent that it caused a significant increase in grain yield;In Field C, ACA and ACE increased leaf width, leaf length, plant height, weight per ear, and grain yield at an an optimum combination of rate of chemical and method of application. At super optimum rates significant adverse effects were noted...|$|R

Some qualitative estimation methods of terpenoids in plant tissue have been previously described {{but there is no}} protocol of estimating the same quantitatively till date. In the present study a protocol has been attempted to estimate the total terpenoids concentration of different resin producing plants using a monoterpene, Linalool as standard reagent. ### Introduction Terpenes and terpenoids are the primary {{constituents of}} the essential oils of many types of plants and flowers. These compounds belong to the isoprenoid group. Even though isoprene itself has not been found in nature, its polymers, terpenic hydrocarbons and their oxygen derivatives are very often present in large quantities in different plant species. The resin produced by most plants is a viscous liquid, composed mainly of volatile fluid terpene 3. The single isoprene unit, therefore, represents the most basic class of terpenes, the hemiterpenes. An isoprene unit bound to a second isoprene is the defining characteristic of terpene, which is also a monoterpene (C 10). Sesquiterpenes contain three isoprene units (C 15), while diterpenes (C 20) and triterpenes (C 30) contain two and three terpene units respectively. Tetraterpenes consist of four terpene units, polyterpenes more than four such units. In nature, terpenes occur predominantly in the form of hydrocarbons, alcohols and their glycosides, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and esters. Apart from broad structural diversity, terpenes also exhibit a wide array of biological actions. Essential oils have antimicrobial, antiparasitic, insecticidal and antioxidant/prooxidant activities that often represent the combined bioactivity of multiple components 10. Many plant terpenoids are cytotoxic towards tumour cells and are applied as chemotherapeutic or chemo-preventive compounds 1, 2. Terpenes play an important role as signal <b>compounds</b> and growth <b>regulators</b> (phytohormones) of plants 10. Many insects metabolize the terpenes which they may have obtained from their plant food for synthesizing growth hormones and pheromones 10. Many plant and insect resins like Lac resin also have economically beneficial properties, useful for varnishes and adhesives 4. This protocol describes a rapid, small-scale, high-throughput assay for approximating the total terpenoids content in plant tissue using a monoterpene, Linalool as standard reagent with conc. sulfuric acid. In this reaction Geraniol (primary alcohol, C 10 H 18 O) may be produced from Linalool (Tertiary alcohol, C 10 H 18 O). Alpha-terpineol (C 10 H 18 O) or such monocyclic terpenoids may further be produced from geraniole 3. It is very obscured to explain the exact chemical nature of the reaction in where a brick red precipitation has been formed and which is partially soluble in reaction mixture solution and chloroform but fully in methanol. All estimation has been done spectroscopically at 538 nm. ### Reagents 1. Methanol (Sigma, Cat. No. M 3641) - Sulfuric Acid (Sigma, Cat. No. 320501) - Chloroform (Sigma, Cat. No. C 2432) - Linalool (Sigma, Cat. No. L 2602) ### Equipment 1. Colorimeter - Mixer mill disrupter with adaptor sets for 2 ml tubes (Qiagen tissue lyser) or Mortar & pestle. ### Procedure 1. Harvest plant material (approximately 500 mg.) in screw-capped tubes & freeze immediately in liquid Nitrogen. [Sample must be stored at - 80 ⁰ C for 1 - 2 months but fresh sample must be preferred] - To homogenize the tissue, place three tungsten Carbide beads & 3. 5 ml of ice-cold 95 % (Vol/Vol) Methanol in each sample tube & insert sample into pre-cooled teflon adaptors. Homogenized tissue for 5 minutes at 30 Hz. If a mixture mill is not available tissue can be homogenized in an ice-cold mortar & pestle. - Remove tungsten carbide beads with a magnet & incubate the sample at room temperature for 48 h in dark. - Centrifuge the samples (4000 g for 15 min. at room temperature) & collect the supernatant in a fresh 2 ml micro-tube. - Add 1. 5 ml Chloroform in each 2 ml microcentrifuge tube & then add 200 µl sample supernatant in each. REMARK For the standard curve 200 µl of previously prepared Linalool solution in methanol will be added to 1. 5 ml Chloroform & serial dilution must be done[dilution level- 100 mg/ 200 µl to 1 mg/ 200 µl (12. 965 µM- 1. 296 µM) Linalool Conc. In case of serial dilution total volume of 200 µl will be make up by addition of 95 % (Vol/Vol) Methanol]. - Vortex the sample mixture thoroughly & take the time 3 min to rest. - Add 100 µl Conc. Sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) to each 2 ml microcentrifuge tube. - CRITICAL STEP If heat generation occurs then the entire system must be cooled by using ice-pad but not more than 15 min. - Then the assay tube must be incubated at room temperature for 1. 5 h- 2 h in dark. - PAUSE POINT For standard solution (Linalool) incubate not more than 5 minutes and during incubation time the microcentrifuge tube must not be disturbed. - At the end of incubation time a reddish brown precipitation will be formed in each assay microcentrifuge tube. Then carefully & gently decant all supernatant reaction mixture liquid with-out disturbing the precipitation. - CRITICAL STEP The reddish brown precipitation is partially soluble in reaction mixture solution so must gently decant the supernatant fluid. - Add 1. 5 ml of 95 % (Vol/Vol) Methanol & vortex thoroughly until all the precipitation dissolve in Methanol completely. - Transfer the sample from assay tube to Colorimetric cuvette [95 % (Vol/Vol) Methanol will be used as blank] to read the absorbance at 538 nm. Total Terpenoid Calculation 12. Calculate a standard curve from the blank-corrected at wave length at 538 nm of the Linalool standard (Fig. 1). Calculate total terpenoids concentration of unknown plant sample as Linalool equivalents using the regression equation of Linalool standard curve. ### Troubleshooting Terpenoids content varies considerably among leaf and bark tissue and also with environmental and biological stress 8, 11. In the design of this experiment we advise the use of multiple biological and technical replicates, in order to minimize the sample errors (Table 1). Different incubation time should be tried with each plant species and tissue to optimize the assay. Automated liquid handling system may also significantly increase throughput and improve results 6. Most probably sulfuric acid rearranged the linalool and the tertiary alcoholic group reduces to primary alcohol for which the solubility of reaction product has been reduced to chloroform. It is very important to note that sulfuric acid not only reacts to terpenoids but also it may react with methanolic extract of plant tissue samples having plant phenolics and alkaloids. ### Anticipated Results Some qualitative estimation methods of terpenoids in plant tissues have been previously described and widely used 9. The quantitative analytical colorimetric method of total terpenoids concentration in plants as suggested in this protocol can be used to estimate the total terpenoids of different resin producing plants. ### References 1.

The cell has evolved as a sophisticated machinery that ensures the quality and stability of the proteome. The network of cellular processes that coordinates protein synthesis, folding, trafficking and clearance, and determines the fate of proteins that do not acquire a native conformation, is responsible for maintaining protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and {{is referred to as}} “the proteostasis network” (PN). The key components of the quality control system are molecular chaperones that ensure proper folding under physiological and stress conditions. To restore homeostasis, the PN also relies on stress sensors and inducible pathways, such as the heat shock response (HSR), the unfolded protein response (UPR) and the oxidative stress response. How a protein folds and acquires its native conformation is a matter of high medical relevance since a large number of human diseases are associated with protein misfolding. These conditions are broadly classified as conformational disorders, and they are caused either by genetic mutations that cause protein misfolding and premature degradation (e. g. Cystic Fibrosis and Gaucher’s disease); or by the accumulation of misfolded, aggregated and/or fibrillar protein inclusions that are toxic to the cell. In particular, the phenomenon of protein aggregation is a hallmark {{of a large number of}} neurodegenerative diseases (e. g. Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington's diseases and several ataxias), muscular dystrophies, metabolic disorders and certain types of cancer. Considerable efforts have been directed at dissecting of the mechanisms of protein aggregation and toxicity, but the full extent of events leading to cell dysfunction is still unclear (Chapter I). The unifying aspect of conformational disorders is, however, the inability of the PN to respond efficiently to misfolded and aggregation-prone proteins so as to prevent cellular toxicity. Therefore, it is urgent and relevant to multiple diseases to identify genetic modifiers that enhance proteostasis function and consequently prevent protein aggregation and toxicity. Research has benefited from powerful model systems that recapitulate important aspects of the human disease. In particular, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is a tractable genetic model organism that combines sufficient complexity so as to allow research on both cellular and organismal (including behavioral) phenotypes, with simplicity that facilitates rapid, high‐throughput testing of hypotheses (Chapter I). Genetic screens performed to date have identified the network’s protective components which, when knocked down or deleted, lead to enhanced aggregation and/or toxicity. These include molecular chaperones, proteasome subunits, components of the autophagy machinery, and the stress-induced transcriptional regulators FOXO/DAF- 16 and HSF- 1. The work described in this thesis is novel as it focuses on the opposite side of the PN, i. e., the pathways that when down-regulated lead to enhanced folding capacity. We established a screening strategy in C. elegans using RNA interference (RNAi) to identify genetic modifiers that suppress protein aggregation and toxicity of multiple disease-related proteins (Chapter II). Our goal was to identify genes that, when downregulated, enhanced the functional properties of the proteostasis network and restored the folding environment. We thus identified 63 genetic modifiers that suppressed both polyglutamine (polyQ) and mutant superoxide dismutase I (SOD 1) aggregation, of which only 23 also suppressed the toxicity phenotype associated with aggregation. This was an important finding as it demonstrated that aggregation and toxicity can be genetically uncoupled. From the initial hits, 9 modifiers systematically reduced the misfolding of endogenous metastable mutant proteins, suggesting a general improvement of the folding environment. We postulated that this effect could be a consequence of activation of the heat shock stress response and chaperone expression by the modifiers. Although, we found that 5 improved folding in a HSF- 1 /chaperone dependent manner, the remaining modifiers improved folding by altering metabolism and RNA processing functions. Overall, this study introduced new genetic modifiers that promote alternate cellular folding environments broadly protective against misfolding events. We then characterized further the genetic modifier gei- 11, a negative regulator of the L-type acetylcholine receptor (AChR) at the neuromuscular junction, to determine the mechanism of proteostasis enhancement (Chapter III). Downregulation of gei- 11 increased cholinergic signaling and calcium flux into the cytoplasm of muscle cells, via activation of the voltage-gated calcium channel, EGL- 19, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum ryanodine receptor, UNC- 68. This resulted in selective activation of HSF- 1 and upregulation of cytosolic chaperones that restored the post-synaptic folding environment. Earlier work had identified a loss-of-function deletion mutation in unc- 30 that regulates GABA expression in C. elegans neurons, and resulting in enhanced polyQ aggregation in post-synaptic muscle cells (Garcia et al. 2007). Notably, enhanced aggregation occurs when GABAergic signaling is completely inhibited, resulting in maximum cholinergic overstimulation of muscle cells, whereas suppression of aggregation results from a moderate increase in cholinergic signaling. The effects of increased AChR expression are not the same as complete inhibition of GABA signaling, in part because the signaling response (and degree of stimulation) occurs at an intermediate level through a titrated response and waves of Ca 2 + release. Therefore, the effect on post-synaptic protein aggregation is a consequence of the degree of imbalance generated between ACh and GABA, with an apparent range for folding improvement by cholinergic signaling. We propose that altogether these studies underscore the importance of the balance between cholinergic and GABAergic signaling as a mechanism for non-autonomous neuronal regulation of proteostasis in postsynaptic cells, and provide compelling evidence that will lead to a better understanding of the control of stress responses through tissue signaling events, which is very relevant for a number of neuromuscular disorders. We have also initiated the characterization of the hit gene let- 607 (Appendix II). This gene is predicted to encode the C. elegans ortholog of CREBh, an ER regulated transmembrane protein (RIP) bZIP transcription factor that maintains sterol homeostasis in the liver and mediates UPR. Downregulation of let- 607 in C. elegans led to an improvement of proteostasis function through activation of the HSR, upregulation of molecular chaperones and consequent suppression of protein misfolding, in an HSF- 1 - and XBP- 1 -dependent manner. UPR induction was found to be epistatic and required for HSR activation by let- 607 RNAi. This is not observed for other UPR inducers, revealing specificity of “crosstalk” between the two stress responses through let- 607. Currently, we are further characterizing the role of let- 607 on UPR and the mechanism involved in UPR-mediated activation of the cytosolic HSR. The studies presented in this thesis emphasize the value of genetic screens and model organisms for the identification of genes and pathways that maintain protein homeostasis and are compromised in disease. Our screening strategy and triage hypotheses revealed novel genes/pathways that can be modulated to improve the PN capacity and help resolving the issue of protein aggregation-toxicity. Even greater value is offered by complementation of these genetic studies with small molecule screens to ultimately identify the suitable targets for therapeutics. This is highlighted in the work on “Chaperone Therapeutics: Small Molecule Proteostasis Regulators of the Heat Shock Response for Protein Conformational Diseases” (Appendix III). In this work we describe the results of a ~ 900, 000 small molecule screen that identified small molecule proteostasis <b>regulator</b> <b>compounds</b> (PRs) that induce HSF- 1 - dependent chaperone expression and restore protein folding in multiple conformational disease models. The enhancement of proteome stability by the PRs is mediated by HSF- 1, DAF- 16 /FOXO, SKN- 1 /Nrf 2 and the chaperone machinery, through mechanisms that are distinct from current known small molecule activators of the HSR. Together, genetic and chemical modulation of the PN reveal new candidates and new mechanisms to be targeted by PRs, establishing promising therapeutic approaches for a variety of protein conformational diseases. O folding proteico, processo pelo qual proteínas adquirem a sua conformação correcta, é essencial para o bom funcionamento molecular e celular. Assim, as células possuem um sofisticado mecanismo de controlo de qualidade do proteoma (i. e., a totalidade das proteínas da célula num dado instante). O conjunto de vias celulares que coordena a síntese, o folding, o tráfego e a degradação de proteínas, e que determina o destino de proteínas que não adquirem a conformação correcta, é responsável por promover e manter a homeostase proteica celular ("proteostasis network" ou PN). Os componentes principais deste sistema de controlo de qualidade são os chaperones moleculares, responsáveis pelo folding de proteínas quer em condições fisiológicas quer sob stress. A PN utiliza sensores e vias induzidas por stress para restabelecer a homeostase, como é o caso da heat shock response (HSR), da unfolded protein response (UPR) e a resposta ao stress oxidativo. O processo de folding, e o modo como cada proteína adquire a sua conformação nativa funcional tem uma enorme relevância clínica uma vez que existe um|$|R
