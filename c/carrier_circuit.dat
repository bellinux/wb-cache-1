5000|$|A DS1 {{telecommunication}} circuit {{is made up}} of twenty-four 8-bit channels (also known as timeslots or DS0s), each channel being a 64 kbit/s DS0 multiplexed <b>carrier</b> <b>circuit.</b> A DS1 is also a full-duplex circuit, which means the circuit transmits and receives 1.544 Mbit/s concurrently. A total of 1.536 Mbit/s of bandwidth is achieved by sampling each of the twenty-four 8-bit DS0s 8000 times per second. This sampling is referred to as 8-kHz sampling (See Pulse-code modulation).

50|$|The T1 <b>carrier</b> <b>circuit</b> {{is a type}} of {{dedicated}} circuit currently employed in North America and Japan. The T1 circuit is divided into 24 channels, each carrying 8,000 samples per second, each 8 bits long. The Super Frame (SF) consist of 12 frames of 24 channels. The DS1 designation consist of 24 frames called, Extended Super Frame (ESF). In either designation, these channels are multiplexed together and sample at 8000 bit/s. In the DS0 designation, each of the channels induces eight bits into the multiplex output stream, ten are utilized entirely for voice/data and two are utilized partially for voice. Hence, each of the two partial channels yields 7 x 8000 bit/s = 56 kbit/s for voice data and the remaining channels yields 8 x 8000 bit/s = 64 kbit/s.|$|E
