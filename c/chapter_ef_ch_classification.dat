40|$|In a {{constantly}} changing environment, executive abilities {{allow us to}} organize sensory information of multiple sources and to adapt to diverse situations {{while at the same}} time inhibiting inappropriate behaviors. Research on the executive functions (EFs) have historical roots on neuropsychology, with the description of frontal patients that were showing disruptions in organizing their daily behaviors independently of any impairment in long-memory, language or general intelligence. A wide range of neuropsychological tools is used today to evaluate executive abilities: Tower of London for planning, go-no-go for inhibition, etc. However, the classical tasks often present methodological limitations and they lack of correspondence between process and behavior. Furthermore, the field lacks of a compelling theory that make links between the EFs themselves. The present PhD work was an attempt to propose a novel task to assess the EFs in the place of the classical batteries of neuropsychological tasks. After offering an overview of the EF literature and presenting simple motor tasks that seem to target similar EFs to those described in neuropsychology (CH 1), I present the spatial-tapping task as a challenging paradigm to understand the relationships between the different <b>EFs</b> (<b>CH</b> 2), and its potential to be used in clinical settings (CH 3). Then I show how a similar approach can be used to investigate how EFs intervene in the control of more complex motor sequences, e. g. bi-manual tasks (CH 4). Overall, the results presented here support an embodied perspective of cognition with mental organization reflecting the way one plans motor sequences for adaptive behavior...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} clinico-serological {{features}} of arthritis from two HCV+ patient groups characterised by mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) or chronic hepatitis (CH). Methods: We retrospectively studied 157 MC patients (119 females, mean age 64. 8 yrs, range 36 - 88) and 155 CH patients (103 females, mean age 58. 8 yrs, range 30 - 81). Patients with HBV and/or HIV co-infections and a follow-up shorter than 1 year were excluded. MC was classified according to standard criteria, while <b>CH</b> <b>classification</b> {{was based on}} Desmet’s criteria. Results: No differences in epidemiology were demonstrated between the two series of patients. Although significantly prevalent in MC patients, extra-hepatic manifestations including nephropathy, neuropathy, pneumopathy, mixed cryoglobulins, RF positivity and hypocomplementemia were detected in both patient groups. Arthritis was present in 23 CH (15 %) and 12 MC (8 %) patients. A symmetrical polyarthritis was observed in 87 % of 23 CH patients, while cryoglobulinemic arthritis was invariably asymmetrical and pauciarticular. Unlike MC patients, who had a constantly nonerosive arthritis, in 7 / 23 CH patients arthritis was erosive. Steroids and/or hydroxycloroquine or D-penicillamine were safe and useful in controlling the arthritis over the short-medium time, although clinical response was more evident in MC patients. Instead, in 5 / 23 CH and 3 / 12 MC patients, interferon-alpha treatment was able to trigger or exacerbate the arthritis despite a good control of liver function. Conclusions: HCV infection seems to be, possibly in genetically predisposed patients, responsible for arthritis at times similar to rheumatoid arthritis. In these patients a careful assessment of the interferon-alpha treatment is mandatory owing to the potential ‘arthritogenic effect’ due to its immunoregulatory properties...|$|R

In this study, the emission of GHG (methane, CH 4; nitrous oxide, N 2 O; and ammonia, NH 3), {{as well as the}} factors affecting GHG and NH 3 emission were investigated in land planted with Lactuca sativa L. and treated with different animal manure composts in a greenhouse located in Beijing. Methane emission flux was significantly affected by soil temperature and humidity, and N 2 O emission flux was related to soil temperature, surface temperature and humidity. The emission fluxes of CH 4, N 2 O and NH 3 were mainly affected by soil moisture, but there was little relation between emissions of CH 4, N 2 O, NH 3 and ambient temperature in the greenhouse.

40|$|Purpose: This study aims to {{describe}} and compare the content of instruments that assess environmental factors (EF) using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Relevance: Assessing the impact of EF on patients' functioning {{is an important part}} of the rehabilitation process. Physiotherapists need to know which instruments assess EF, which EF these instruments assess and which methodology of assessment they use, in order to choose the appropriate instrument. The ICF provides a universal framework that can be used {{to describe}} and compare the health of patients and that serves as a reference for the documentation in physiotherapy. Therefore it can be used to characterise existing instruments. Participants: Not applicable. Methods: A systematic search of 3 databases (PubMed, CINAHL and PEDro) was conducted to identify all instruments that assess EF. Combinations of the following key words were used without language restriction: environment, factors, components, barriers to participation, facilitators to participation, International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, social participation. Two investigators independently screened all instruments identified, which were included if developed for adults, addressed more than one 2 nd level category of any of the 5 <b>Chapters</b> on <b>EF</b> and not specific to a health condition. Analysis: Included instruments had their content examined independently by 2 investigators that identified all meaningful concepts and linked them to the most precise ICF category according to published rules. Percentage agreement between the 2 investigators varied between 84 % and 95 %. Results: 8 instruments met the inclusion criteria containing 558 meaningful concepts linked to 2 nd or 3 rd level ICF categories from one of the 5 <b>EF</b> <b>chapters</b> (1. Products and technology, 2. Natural Environment, 3. Support and relationships, 4. Attitudes, 5. Services, systems and policies). 5 / 8 instruments cover all the 5 chapters; 1 / 8 instrument covers 4 / 5 chapters (1, 3 - 5); 1 / 8 instrument covers chapters 1 and 2 and 1 / 8 instrument covers chapter 1 only. 5 / 8 instruments had between 61 % and 100 % of their items linked to categories in Chapter 1. In contrast, the highest percentage of items from one instrument linked to categories in Chapter 2 was 11 %, Chapter 3 was 30 %, Chapter 4 was 20 % and Chapter 5 was 49 %. 3 / 8 instruments assessed whether EF were present or absent in a specific context, 3 / 8 assessed the intensity of EF' impact and 2 / 8 assessed the intensity and frequency of the EF' impact. Conclusions: Instruments assessing EF differ in their content and type of assessment and have several items linked to the same ICF category. Most instruments are designed to assess primarily products and technology (Chapter 1) and only a minority assesses the intensity and frequency of EF' impact, which is of great relevance to rehabilitation. Different instruments are needed that assess the intensity and frequency of EF' impact and that use ICF categories as the items for assessment. Implications: The results of this study can guide physiotherapists in clinical practice and research in selecting an appropriate EF instrument for a specific purpose...|$|R

Recoveries of fortified samples were > 91 % for COS, CS 2, CH 3 Br, SF, PPO, and PH 3 and > 76 % for C 2 N 2 and EF. Completeness of extraction was assessed from the amount of fumigant retained by the microwaved hay.

Limits of quantification were < 0. 1 mg/kg for COS, CS 2, C 2 N 2, EF, and PH 3 and < 0. 5 mg/kg for CH 3 Br, SF, and PPO.

The T 1 diet is similar in quality to typical diets in the region. Calliandra is a leguminous fodder tree promoted as a feed supplement. Fresh feces and urine were applied to grasslands and emissions measured using static chambers. Cumulative 28 -d fecal emissions were 302 ± 52. 4 and 95 ± 13. 8 mg CH 4 –C kg− 1 dry matter for Friesen and Boran steers, respectively, and 11. 5 ± 4. 26 and 24. 7 ± 8. 32 mg N 2 O–N kg− 1 dry matter for Friesian and Boran steers, respectively. For urine from Friesian steers, the N 2 O emissions were 2. 8 ± 0. 64 mg N 2 O–N 100 mL urine− 1.

These gases are part of a fuel known as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or as Natural Gas for Vehicles (NGV) in Thailand. This fuel is used as an alternative to oil, which has decreased the amount of gasoline and diesel oil used in the transportation sector of Thailand. This study used different types of cars that were tested on a chassis dynamometer with a Bangkok driving cycle to measure the emissions of CH 4 and CO 2 and then to calculate the averages of EF-CH 4 and EF-CO 2, which are associated with speed and fuel consumption, respectively. This study was conducted in 3 vehicle types that are actually used in Thailand, namely, Heavy Duty Diesel Vehicles (HDDV), Light Duty Diesel Vehicles (LDDV) and Light Duty Gasoline Vehicles (LDGV). Our results showed that of the three vehicle types, HDDV produced the highest EF-CH 4 and EF-CO 2 averages at 7. 22 and 919. 6 g km - 1, respectively. LDDV produced the lowest EF-CH 4 (0. 17 g km - 1) and LDGV produced the lowest EF-CO 2 (153. 8 g km - 1). In addition, the EF-CH 4 and EF-CO 2 values of LDDV and LDGV were comparable even though the engine types of these vehicles were different.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{develop a}} {{comprehensive}} set of categories from the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as a minimal standard for reporting and assessing functioning and disability in clinical populations along {{the continuum of}} care. The specific aims were to specify the domains of functioning recommended for such ICF Rehabilitation Set and to identify a minimal set of environmental factors (EFs) to be used alongside the ICF Rehabilitation Sets when describing disability across individuals and populations with various health conditions. DESIGN: A secondary analysis of existing data sets was performed using regression methods (Random Forests and Group Lasso regression) and expert consultation. SETTING: Along the continuum of care, including acute, early-post acute, and long-term and community rehabilitation settings. PARTICIPANTS: In the primary studies 9863 persons participated with various health condition. The number of respondents for whom the dependent variable data were available and used for this analysis consisted of 9264 participants. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For the Regression analyses, self-reported general health was used as dependent variable. The ICF categories from the functioning component and EFs component were used as independent variables {{for the development of}} the ICF Rehabilitation Set and minimal set of EFs respectively. RESULTS: Thirty ICF categories to be complemented with 12 EFs were identified as relevant for the identified ICF sets. The ICF Rehabilitation Set constitutes of 9 ICF categories from the component Body Functions and 21 from the component Activities and Participation. The minimal set of EFs contains 12 categories spanning all <b>chapters</b> of the <b>EFs</b> component of the ICF. CONCLUSION: The identified sets proposed serve as minimal generic sets of aspects of functioning in clinical populations for reporting data within and across heath conditions, time, clinical settings including rehabilitation, and countries. These sets present a reference framework for harmonizing existing information on disability across general and clinical populations. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is the construction, the {{analysis}} and the implementation of new efficient and accurate numerical methods for the solution of evolutionary oscillatory problems. More specifically the thesis concerns: the computation of oscillatory integrals over unbounded intervals, the solution of Volterra integral equations with periodic solution and of special second-order ordinary differential equations with periodic or exponentially decaying solution. Some applications, analytical properties and theoretical results are reported in Chapter 1. General purpose methods require a small stepsize in order to follow the oscillations of the solution, therefore they result inefficient. Our idea is to exploit the qualitative knowledge of the solution in order to construct new efficient and accurate numerical methods specially tuned on the problem. These methods are derived by using the Exponential Fitting (EF) theory. A more detailed description of this theory is provided in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3 {{a new class of}} exponentially fitted (ef) quadrature formulae for the computation of oscillatory infinite integrals is constructed and analyzed. The weights and the nodes of these ef formulae depend on the frequency of the integrand function and are solution of a nonlinear system. To solve this system we develop a suitable efficient version of Newton method. We study the error behaviour of these formulae and we prove that the error decreases as the oscillation increases. We build exponentially fitted Gauss-Laguerre rules with 1 up to 6 nodes. Numerical experiments on significant test examples confirm theoretical expectations and show that the ef Gauss-Laguerre rules are more efficient than the classical ones. In <b>Chapter</b> 4 an <b>ef</b> Direct Quadrature (DQ) method for the numerical solution of Volterra integral equations (VIEs) with periodic solution is described. This method is based on an ef two nodes Gaussian quadrature rule. The weights and the nodes of this quadrature formula depend on the frequency of the problem and are solution of a nonlinear system. This ef Gaussian DQ method requires the knowledge of the numerical solution in points not belonging to the mesh. Therefore we develop a suitable ef interpolation formula which depends on the frequency, too, and preserves the accuracy order of the whole method. The convergence analysis shows that the order of the ef DQ method is four like the classical Gaussian DQ method, but the error is smaller when periodic problems are treated. Various numerical experiments show that on test VIEs with oscillatory or periodic solution, at the same computational cost, the ef Gaussian DQ method is more accurate than the classical Gaussian DQ method even for approximated values of the frequency. In Chapter 5, we introduce multistage methods for special second order differential equations (ODEs) with periodic or with exponentially decaying solution. We introduce these multistage methods by considering the contributions of the stage errors in the overall numerical scheme and by means the EF technique. In this way we develop a revised version of some EF-based Runge-Kutta-Nyström (RKN) methods. The coefficients of these methods depend on the problem parameters, i. e. the frequency of oscillations, for periodic problems, or the exponent, for problems with exponentially decaying solution. Therefore we propose a suitable strategy to estimate these parameters when they are not available. This strategy is based on the annihilation of the principal term of the local truncation error and does not require further function evaluations. Then an example of revised explicit two-stages ef RKN method is given and some numerical experiments are carried out. These tests show that this ef-RKN method outperforms the standard one and that the parameter estimation is sharp. Finally, in Chapter 6 we propose a parallel quadrature algorithm on Graphics Processing Units (GPU) based on Newton-Cotes formulas. This is a preliminary step for the numerical solution of multidimensional integrals and discretized Volterra integral equations. We report some numerical results obtained by the multi-GPU cluster E 4 belonging to the Department of Mathematics, University of Salerno...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundThere is {{increasing}} evidence that BRCA 1 -related DNA-repair defects determine sensitivity to certain agents, such as platinum-based chemotherapy. There {{is a lot}} of evidence about a link between TNBC and BRCA 1 deficiency. Many clinical characteristics and molecular features are shared by sporadic triple-negative breast cancer and BRCA 1 -associated breast cancer. The majority of BRCA 1 -related breast cancers are of basal-like/triple-negative phenotype. Identification of specific markers of BRCA 1 -dysfunction will be essential to translate an understanding of defective DNA repair into targeted treatments for this poor prognosis subtype. Materials and methodsTwenty-two patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) were treated with neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy followed by surgery. Pathologic treatment response was assessed in correlation with biomarkers of BRCA 1 -dysfunction. Pathological response was evaluated according to the Chevallier <b>classification</b> (<b>Ch).</b> All patients were screened for germ-line mutations in BRCA 1 (185 delAG, 5382 insC, 4153 delA, 4158 A/G, C 61 G) and BRCA 2 (6174 delT). All samples negative for germ-line mutations in BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 then submitted to BRCA 1 -dysfunction screening. Biomarkers of BRCA 1 -dysfunction included: BRCA 1 somatic mutations (C 61 G, 185 delAG, 5382 insC), promoter methylation of BRCA 1, low BRCA 1 mRNA expression, high ID 4 mRNA expression, low RAD 51 mRNA expression, PTEN (T 4721 C) mutation, p 53 (Arg 72 Pro, Pro 72 Pro) mutations. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), methylation-specific PCR were used for BRCA 1 -dysfunction analysis. ResultsTwelve patients (54. 5 %) achieved a pathological complete response (pCR) (Ch 1 + Ch 2). Ten patients (45. 5 %) had a residual disease (Ch 3 + Ch 4). BRCA 1 mRNA expression was absent in 16 / 22 (72. 7 %) patients, low in 5 / 22 (22. 7 %). 11 / 21 (52. 4 %) patients with other than normal BRCA 1 mRNA expression achieved a pCR. BRCA 1 promoter methylation was detected in 9 / 22 (40. 9 %). 6 / 9 patients with BRCA 1 promoter methylation achieved a pCR. RAD 51 mRNA levels were low in 14 / 22 (63. 6 %), high in 1 / 22 (4. 5 %). 8 / 14 (57. 1 %) patients with other than normal RAD 51 mRNA expression achieved a pCR. High ID 4 mRNA levels were determined in 5 / 22 (22. 7 %). 3 / 5 (60 %) patients with high ID 4 mRNA expression achieved a pCR. p 53 (Arg 72 Pro, Pro 72 Pro) mutations were identified in 12 / 22 (54. 5 %). No patient had PTEN (T 4721 C) mutation. No statistically significant correlation was found between the BRCA 1 mRNA expression, BRCA 1 promoter methylation, RAD 51 mRNA expression, high ID 4 mRNA levels, p 53 (Arg 72 Pro, Pro 72 Pro) mutations and pCR to neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy (p> 0. 05). Eleven patients had BRCA 1 somatic mutations: 6 / 22 (27. 3 %) – BRCA 1 5382 insC, 4 / 22 (18. 2 %) – BRCA 1 185 delAG, 3 / 22 (13. 6 %) – BRCA 1 C 61 G. 3 / 4 patients with BRCA 1 185 delAG mutation had BRCA 1 C 61 G mutation. BRCA 1 LOH was detected in 1 / 22 (4. 5 %) patient. All patients with BRCA 1 5382 insC mutation achieved a pCR (p= 0. 01). All patients with BRCA 1 185 delAG mutation and BRCA 1 C 61 G mutation had residual disease (0. 04 and 0. 1, accordingly). ConclusionBRCA 1 5382 insC somatic mutation is associated with good response to neoadjuvant platinum based chemotherapy (p= 0. 01). BRCA 1 185 delAG and BRCA 1 C 61 G mutations in the BRCA 1 RING domain may predict resistance to neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy (0. 04 and 0. 1, accordingly) ...|$|R
40|$|Chapter 1 {{is a brief}} {{introduction}} to several aspects of cardiovascular pressure-volume relations in dialysis patients. The aims of the thesis are presented. In Chapter 2, an overview is presented of circulatory physiology in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Volume withdrawal by ultrafiltration during HD may lead to intravascular hypovolemia and intradialytic hypotension. Hemodynamic defense mechanisms are discussed, focusing on left ventricular (LV) function. The concept of load, which reflects {{the interaction between the}} heart and the vascular system, is explained. Chronic pressure and volume overload account for a high prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in dialysis patients. LVH may lead to LV dysfunction, which may eventually become manifest as heart failure. In dialysis patients, however, elevated cardiac filling pressures may reflect volume overload before HD rather than heart failure, and loading conditions are altered by volume witdrawal during HD. The cyclic changes in volume status hamper the assessment of LV function in HD patients. Current LV systolic and diastolic function measurements in clinical practice are reviewed. The load dependence of these measurements is discussed. Finally, future perspectives for load-independent assessment of LV function and measurement of pressure-volume relations in clinical dialysis practice are suggested. The cyclic changes in volume status and recurring cardiovascular strains of the HD procedure may lead to chronic myocardial damage, especially in patients with LVH or myocardial fibrosis. In these conditions, a decreased myocardial capillary density and reduction in myocardial flow reserve may lead to a reduced myocardial perfusion pressure during HD or volume overload before HD. In Chapter 3, we observed a high incidence of elevated cardiac troponin T (cTnT) measured in our entire dialysis population before a HD session. Although none of the patients had evidence of acute ischemic myocardial injury, baseline cTnT was elevated in 82 %. The incidence of elevated cTnT was higher in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. During a two-year follow-up period, patients with an elevated cTnT also had a higher mortality rate. In a subgroup, cTnT was measured during the HD procedure and no change in cTnT levels was found. We concluded that elevated cTnT levels in asymptomatic dialysis patients are of prognostic value. They are not caused by acute myocardial injury or by HD itself, but may be related to chronic myocardial damage or decreased clearance of cTnT degradation fragments. However, in dialysis patients who had an acute coronary syndrome during the follow-up period, cTnT increased above baseline, and tended to return to baseline after recovery. Therefore, a cTnT rise in dialysis patients above the individual baseline does appear to be diagnostic of acute myocardial injury. LV diastolic dysfunction is believed to be common in dialysis patients, especially in patients with LVH. However, as conventional echo Doppler parameters are load-dependent, predialysis hypervolemia may lead to pseudonormalization, and thereby mask diastolic dysfunction. In Chapter 4, we introduced new Doppler parameters of LV diastolic function. Mitral annulus velocity by Doppler tissue imaging (DTI) and LV inflow propagation velocity from color M-mode were measured before and after HD. Using these new echo Doppler techniques, which have been proposed as relatively preload-independent measurements of diastolic function, we demonstrated diastolic dysfunction in this study population. Unexpectedly, these techniques exhibited a pattern of load dependence similar to that displayed by the conventional Doppler measurements. So even when using the newer Doppler techniques, the degree of diastolic dysfunction was underestimated as a result of pseudonormalization due to volume overload. Therefore, the advantage of these techniques over conventional parameters for the assessment of LV diastolic function in dialysis patients is limited. Alternatively, DTI may reflect the actual diastolic function, which would imply that HD impaired cardiac relaxation and thereby worsened LV diastolic function. This could have been caused by the increase in serum ionized calcium concentration during HD. To further unravel the effects of changes in volume and in serum ionized calcium, we tested the effect of HD without ultrafiltration on these measurements, as was described in Chapter 5. Transmitral flow and mitral annulus velocities were measured before and after 1 hour of HD without ultrafiltration. The use of a standard 1. 75 mmol/L dialysate Ca 2 + concentration resulted in a significant increase in serum ionized calcium after one hour. Despite this increase, there was no change in transmitral flow and tissue Doppler velocities. This confirms the conclusion of the previous chapter, i. e. that the change in both transmitral Doppler and DTI results from changes in preload. Chronic pressure overload results from increased arterial stiffness, which becomes clinically manifest as systolic hypertension with an increased pulse pressure. A reduced aortic compliance signifies an increased cardiac pulsatile load, which promotes the development of LVH. In Chapter 6, a pulse pressure method is introduced, which is based on the Windkessel model, and can be used to estimate aortic compliance non-invasively. This technique, which combines carotid pulse contour analysis by applanation tonometry with aortic outflow volume measurements by Doppler echocardiography, has not been applied before in a dialysis population. We tested whether a reduction in volume overload by ultrafiltration during HD leads to an improvement of aortic compliance. After volume withdrawal, we observed a concomitant decrease in arterial pressure and a small improvement in aortic compliance. We concluded that the increase in aortic stiffness in dialysis patients is partly caused by a reversible reduction of aortic compliance due to volume expansion. Volume withdrawal by HD moves the arterial wall characteristics back to a more favorable position on the non-linear pressure-volume curve. LV systolic dysfunction is thought to contribute to an increased frequency of intradialytic hypotension. However, accurate measurement of LV function in dialysis patients is hampered by the load dependence of commonly used parameters, such as the LV ejection fraction (EF). The end-systolic pressure-volume relationship, or end-systolic elastance (Ees), represents the mechanical properties of a fully contracted ventricle. This inherent characteristic of a given LV is a parameter of LV systolic function which is almost insensitive to load. Ees was estimated non-invasively in hypotension-prone and hypotension-resistant dialysis patients from the acute LV response to preload reduction by nitroglycerine, as described in <b>Chapter</b> 7. <b>EF,</b> LV area and finger arterial pressure (Finapres) were recorded continuously before HD. Finapres and LV area data were combined to create pressure-area loops following intravenous nitroglycerine. Hypotension-prone and hypotension-resistant dialysis patients had similar Ees. Thus, it seems doubtful whether LV systolic function {{plays an important role in}} the genesis of intradialytic hypotension. Ees in both groups was low compared to Ees from pressure-area loops in non-uremic patients undergoing cardiac surgery. As EF before dialysis indicated normal systolic function, LV systolic dysfunction in dialysis patients is masked by the load dependence of conventional measurements. The measurement of LV pressure-volume relations yields valuable information on how the LV is coupled to the vascular system. This knowledge is essential in identifying dialysis patients with LV dysfunction. With this information, dialysis patients with heart failure can be distinguished from dialysis patients with excessive volume overload before HD, in whom lowering dry weight might suffice. Identification of dialysis patients with LV dysfunction at an earlier stage, i. e. before heart failure becomes clinically manifest, not only helps secondary prevention, but also provides a tool for measuring the results of treatment and intervention trials. Clinically applicable, load-independent measurement of LV function, therefore, could help improve the quality of life and management of our dialysis patients. Hoofdstuk 1 is een korte inleiding waarin verschillende aspecten van cardiovasculaire druk-volumerelaties in hemodialysepatiënten en de doelstellingen van het proefschrift worden gepresenteerd. In Hoofdstuk 2 wordt een overzicht gepresenteerd van de fysiologie van de circulatie in hemodialysepatiënten. Het onttrekken van volume door middel van ultrafiltratie tijdens hemodialyse kan leiden tot intravasculaire ondervulling en intradialytische hypotensie. Hemodynamische verdedigingsmechanismen worden besproken, waarbij de nadruk ligt op de functie van de linker ventrikel (LV) van het hart. Het begrip load, waarmee de interactie tussen het hart en het vaatstelsel wordt weergegeven, wordt uitgelegd. Chronische druk- en volumeoverbelasting zijn verantwoordelijk voor een hoge prevalentie van linkerventrikelhypertrofie (LVH) in dialysepatiënten. LVH kan leiden tot LV dysfunctie, hetgeen manifest kan worden als hartfalen. In dialysepatiënten kan een verhoogde cardiale vullingsdruk echter een uiting zijn van hypervolemie voorafgaande aan de hemodialyse in plaats van hartfalen. Verder worden preload en afterload beïnvloed door het onttrekken van volume door ultrafiltratie tijdens de dialyse. De cyclische veranderingen van de volumetoestand kunnen een belemmering vormen voor het onderzoek van de LV functie in dialysepatiënten. De momenteel gangbare methoden om de systolische en diastolische LV functie in de klinische praktijk te meten worden besproken, alsmede hun load-afhankelijkheid. Ten slotte worden er suggesties gedaan om de LV functie en druk-volumerelaties onafhankelijk van de load|$|R
