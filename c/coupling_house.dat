50|$|A grooved fitting, {{also known}} as a grooved coupling, has four elements: grooved pipe, gasket, <b>coupling</b> <b>housing,</b> and nuts and bolts. The groove is made by {{cold-forming}} (or machining) a groove {{at the end of a}} pipe. A gasket encompassed by <b>coupling</b> <b>housing</b> is wrapped around the two pipe ends, with the coupling engaging the groove; the bolts and nuts are tightened with a socket or impact wrench. The installed <b>coupling</b> <b>housing</b> encases the gasket and engages the grooves around the pipe to create a leakproof seal in a self-restrained pipe joint. There are two types of grooved coupling; a flexible coupling allows a limited amount of angular movement, and a rigid coupling does not allow movement and may be used where joint immobility is required (similar to a flange or welded joint).|$|R

5000|$|Grooved {{coupling}} {{pipe joining}} systems uses a roll grooving technique to join pipes and pipe joining components. A groove {{is placed on}} the end of two pipes to prepare the pipes engagement with the <b>coupling</b> <b>housing</b> and gasket. The gasket creates a pressure responsive seal on the outside diameter of the pipe, unlike standard compression joints, where pressure acts to separate the seal. The gasket sealing is enhanced as the <b>coupling</b> <b>housing</b> is tightened onto the pipe end. [...] "The economics of the grooved method derive from simplified assembly that involves three basic concepts: a pressure responsive gasket that creates a leak-tight seal; couplings that hold the pipe together; and fasteners that secure the couplings.|$|R
