500|$|The episode {{received}} widespread acclaim {{from television}} critics. Daniel Martin, writing for The Guardian called it [...] "an astonishing achievement" [...] and [...] "absolutely bloody terrifying". He praised the way Moffat handled River Song's story, {{as well as}} for making it an [...] "intricate romp jammed with ideas that make a truly cinematic piece of drama". Gavin Fuller's review for The Daily Telegraph praised the suspense and [...] "the revelation that all the statues were Angels" [...] which he called [...] "genuinely shocking". Though he commented it [...] "took a while to get going", once it did he thought it had turned into the [...] "first genuine chiller" [...] of the series. He wrote that the [...] "only real disappointment" [...] was the [...] "inference that the TARDIS doesn't really have to make its celebrated 'vworp, vworp' noise on landing", asking [...] "How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> to us long-time fans, Steven Moffat– that sound is part of the warp and weft of the programme!".|$|E
2500|$|The {{product was}} code named the VIC-40 as the {{successor}} to the popular VIC-20. The team that constructed it consisted of Yash Terakura, Shiraz Shivji, Bob Russell, Bob Yannes and David A. Ziembicki. The design, prototypes, and some sample software were finished {{in time for the}} show, after the team had worked tirelessly over both Thanksgiving and Christmas weekends. The machine used the same case, same-sized motherboard, and same Commodore BASIC 2.0 in ROM as the VIC-20. BASIC also served as the user interface shell and was available immediately on startup at the READY prompt. When the product was to be presented, the VIC-40 product was renamed C64. The C64 made an impressive debut at the January 1982 Consumer Electronics Show, as recalled by Production Engineer David A. Ziembicki: [...] "All we saw at our booth were Atari people with their mouths dropping open, saying, 'How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> for $595?'" [...] The answer was vertical integration; due to Commodore's ownership of MOS Technology's semiconductor fabrication facilities, each C64 had an estimated production cost of [...]|$|E

5000|$|Frank Zappa {{recruited}} artist Neon Park {{to create}} a subversive image based on a cover story from the September 1956 issue of Man's Life, a Men's adventure magazine. The magazine's cover story depicts a shirtless man being attacked by numerous weasels, above the caption [...] "Weasels Ripped My Flesh". After showing Neon {{a copy of the}} magazine, Zappa inquired, [...] "This is it. What <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that's</b> worse than this?" [...] Neon's answer was to craft a parody of an advertisement for Schick brand electric razor based on the [...] "Weasels Ripped My Flesh" [...] theme. The record company released the album despite its reservations about the album cover.|$|R

"I'm {{not finding}} fault, Simms," [...] {{returned}} another voice which the girl recognized immediately as Divine's; [...] "although I {{do think that}} {{it was a mistake to}} so totally disable the Lotus as you did. Why, how on earth are we ever to return to civilization if that boat is lost? Had she been simply damaged a little, in a way that they could themselves have fixed up, the delay would have been sufficient to permit us to escape, and then, when Miss Harding was returned in safety to her father, after our marriage, they would have been so glad to be reunited that he easily could have been persuaded to drop the matter. Then another thing; you intended to demand a ransom for both Miss Harding and myself, to carry out the fiction of my having been stolen also--how <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> if Mr. Harding be dead?

Do you think that with such motives on my part for {{tenderness}} towards her, for loving care, for the most anxious solicitude, that I can be made more anxious, more tender, more loving by coarse epithets from you? I am the most miserable being under the sun because our happiness has been interrupted, and is it likely that such misery should be cured by violent words and gestures? If your heart is wrung for her, so is mine. If she be much to you, she is more to me. She came here the other day, almost as a stranger, and I thought that my heart would have burst beneath its weight of woe.
