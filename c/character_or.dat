5|$|For Reich, {{character}} {{structure was}} the result of social processes, in particular a reflection of castration and Oedipal anxieties playing themselves out within the nuclear family. Les Greenberg and Jeremy Safran write that Reich proposed a functional identity between the character, emotional blocks, and tension in the body, or what he called <b>character</b> (<b>or</b> muscular/body) armour (Charakterpanzer).|$|E

50|$|A nice {{feature of}} SYNTAX (compared to Lex/Yacc) is its {{built-in}} algorithm for automatically recovering from lexical and syntactic errors, by deleting extra <b>characters</b> <b>or</b> tokens, inserting missing <b>characters</b> <b>or</b> tokens, permuting <b>characters</b> <b>or</b> tokens, etc. This algorithm has a default behaviour {{that can be}} modified by providing a custom set of recovery rules adapted to the language for which the lexer and parser are built.|$|R

Most units of the player civilizations speak in English language, with the exception of unique units such as Spanish Rodeleros, Spanish Lancers, German Ulhans and German War Wagons.|$|E
5|$|LGBT {{themes in}} {{speculative}} fiction {{refer to the}} incorporation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) themes into science fiction, fantasy, horror fiction and related genres.

5|$|Baker's last {{published}} work, Right Wing, {{as well as}} his posthumous novels Testosterone and Anarchy, {{represent a}} stylistic departure in that he inserts himself into the plot as either a secondary <b>character</b> <b>or</b> the protagonist. The latter two were edited, {{and in the case of}} Anarchy, partially rewritten by his editor, Scott Brassart. Testosterone needed only minor changes, while Anarchy underwent an entire rewrite, with Brassart restructuring the plot and streamlining over 500 pages of prose and notes into a fast-paced, 250 page novel. For the reader, however, it is only Baker's voice as writer that is heard.|$|E

5|$|Between 1943 and 1951, fictional collie Lassie was the {{inspiration}} for seven MGM feature films. With completion of the seventh film in 1951, the studio planned no further films for the Lassie <b>character</b> <b>or</b> Pal, the dog actor who portrayed the character. In lieu of $40,000 back pay owed him by MGM, Pal's owner and trainer Rudd Weatherwax took all rights to the Lassie trademark and name, and hit the road with Pal to perform at fairs, rodeos, and other venues.|$|E
5|$|DeGeneres began {{negotiating}} with ABC in 1996 to have Morgan come out. When {{word of the}} negotiations got out, DeGeneres found herself {{at the center of}} intense speculation about when she or her <b>character,</b> <b>or</b> both, would come out. With DeGeneres hinting at her and her character's coming out both off-screen and within the show, the rumors were confirmed when the episode went into production in March 1997.|$|E
5|$|Head pain {{occurs in}} 50–75% {{of all cases}} of {{vertebral}} artery dissection. It tends to be located {{at the back of}} the head, either on the affected side or in the middle, and develops gradually. It is either dull or pressure-like in <b>character</b> <b>or</b> throbbing. About half of those with VAD consider the headache distinct, while the remainder have had a similar headache before. It is suspected that VAD with headache as the only symptom is fairly common; 8% of all cases of vertebral and carotid dissection are diagnosed on the basis of pain alone.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to gaining levels, Guardian Forces earn Ability Points (AP) after battles, which are automatically allocated to special abilities that Guardian Forces can learn. When a Guardian Force has learned an ability, that ability becomes available for any <b>character</b> <b>or</b> the character party, {{as is the}} case with field abilities. These abilities allow characters to attack more efficiently, refine magic spells from items, receive stat bonuses upon leveling up, access shops remotely and use additional battle commands.|$|E
5|$|Specialised {{terms are}} used in taxonomic research. Primary {{homology}} is the initial hypothesis made by a researcher based on similar structure or anatomical connections, inferring that two characters share an ancestry. Secondary homology is implied by parsimony analysis, where a character that only occurs once on a tree is taken to be homologous. As implied in this definition, many cladists consider homology to be synonymous with synapomorphy, a shared derived <b>character</b> <b>or</b> trait state that distinguishes a clade from other organisms.|$|E
5|$|The NULL literal is untyped in SQL, {{meaning that}} it is not {{designated}} as an integer, <b>character,</b> <b>or</b> any other specific data type. Because of this, it is sometimes mandatory (or desirable) to explicitly convert Nulls to a specific data type. For instance, if overloaded functions are supported by the RDBMS, SQL {{might not be able to}} automatically resolve to the correct function without knowing the data types of all parameters, including those for which Null is passed.|$|E

5|$|The Round Church {{featured}} {{marble and}} limestone cornices. These included {{a large number}} of intertwined ornaments and details, such as palmettes, grape clusters, leaves, and chamfers. Besides classic ornamental shapes, the cornices feature some that are entirely new in <b>character</b> <b>or</b> well-known yet redesigned motifs. Floral decoration dominates the cornices. Tiles found inside the church ruins depict birds and other animals in addition to geometric shapes and floral motifs, all glazed in either brown, yellow, green, blue, or blue-green. The walls were covered in polished marble facing with encrusted shapes.|$|E
5|$|Voltaire {{develops}} no formal, systematic philosophy for {{the characters}} to adopt. The {{conclusion of the}} novel may be thought of not as a philosophical alternative to optimism, but as a prescribed practical outlook (though what it prescribes is in dispute). Many critics have concluded that one minor <b>character</b> <b>or</b> another is portrayed as having the right philosophy. For instance, a number believe that Martin is treated sympathetically, and that his character holds Voltaire's ideal philosophy—pessimism. Others disagree, citing Voltaire's negative descriptions of Martin's principles and {{the conclusion of the}} work in which Martin plays little part.|$|E
5|$|While {{relying on}} a script each week, the {{producers}} decided at the outset to allow the cast leeway in what they said and did on the show. Their decisions could affect the delivery of their lines and the blocking of each scene. If the actors felt that something was untrue to their <b>character</b> <b>or</b> a mode of delivery didn't work, they were free to change it, provided they still hit the vital plot points.|$|E
