In September 1941, the Central Landing Establishment was renamed the Airborne Forces Establishment. The Rotachute Mark I design initially comprised a tubular steel framework with a single seat, rubber-mounted rotor hub, hanging control column, skid undercarriage, and a self-inflating rear fairing made of rubberised fabric with integral tailplane. The two rotor blades, of wooden construction, could achieve flapping and coning characteristics via hinges on the rotor hub. Fixed footrests were provided, plus fittings below the seat to accommodate a soldier's weapon, such as a Bren gun. The control column offered two-axis control, rolling and pitching, with turns made via <b>controlled</b> <b>rolling</b> movement. Air Ministry Specification No. 11/42 was issued retrospectively to describe the outline requirements. The Ministry of Aircraft Production sub-contracted construction of parts to specialist firms including F. Hills and Sons, Airwork General Trading, Dynaflex, Dunlop, and H. Morris & Co. Some full size rotor trials were carried out using a pivoting rig mounted on a Ford flatbed truck, and full-size unmanned airframes were used in ground-based and inflight trials.|$|E

Direct quenching (DQ) has gained {{interest in the}} past few decades and requires quenching immediately after working above or below the austenite recrystallization temperature to form martensitic microstructures. In the current study, microalloyed ASTM A 514 steel is used to produce martensite from either equiaxed or pancaked prior austenite grain (PAG) microstructures. The equiaxed PAG conditions simulate microstructures produced by RA/Q and the pancaked PAG conditions simulate microstructures produced by <b>controlled</b> <b>rolling</b> (CR) before DQ. <b>Controlled</b> <b>rolling</b> followed by DQ was simulated with double hit compression in a Gleeble ® 3500. The prior austenite grain size (PAGS) was varied between 9 and 75 µm prior to <b>controlled</b> <b>rolling.</b> The strengthening and toughening mechanisms are being investigated in the as-quenched (AsQ), low temperature tempered (LTT: 200 °C), and high temperature tempered (HTT: 600 °C) conditions. The equiaxed PAG condition has a Hall-Petch (H-P) relationship between yield strength (or microhardness) and PAGS in the AsQ condition. There is not a H-P relationship between PAGS and microhardness in the CR-DQ conditions. The CR-DQ conditions generally exhibit higher microhardness than the RA/Q conditions with similar PAGS, with the most significant differences in the larger PAGS conditions. Toughness was only measured in the equiaxed PAG conditions. The smallest PAGS has the lowest ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) with the highest strength in the AsQ and LTT conditions.
