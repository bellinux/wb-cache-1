The propensity of the system to enter this <b>conformation</b> dramatically influences reaction rate, with α-substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain.

Common defects of the hind limbs include the same base-wide and base-narrow stances and problems with the feet as the fore limbs, as well as multiple issues with the angle formed by the hock joint being too angled (sickle-hocked), too straight (straight behind) or having an inward deviation (cow-hocked).

40|$|Proteins {{must move}} between {{different}} <b>conformations</b> of their native ensemble {{to perform their}} functions. Crystal structures obtained from high-resolution X-ray diffraction data reflect this heterogeneity as a spatial and temporal conformational average. Although movement between natively populated alternative <b>conformations</b> can be critical for characterizing molecular mechanisms, {{it is challenging to}} identify these <b>conformations</b> within electron den-sity maps. Alternative side chain <b>conformations</b> are generally well separated into distinct rotameric <b>conformations,</b> but alternative backbone <b>conformations</b> can overlap at several atomic positions. Our model building program qFit uses mixed integer quadratic program-ming (MIQP) to evaluate an extremely large number of combinations of sidechain conform-ers and backbone fragments to locally explain the electron density.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} robotics-inspired method to enhance {{sampling}} of native-like protein <b>conformations</b> when employing only amino-acid sequence. Computing such <b>conformations,</b> essential to associate structural and functional information withgenesequences,ischallengingduetothehigh-dimensionality and the rugged energy {{surface of the}} protein conformational space. The contribution of this work is a novel two-layered method to enhance the sampling of geometrically-distinct lowenergy <b>conformations</b> at a coarse-grained level of detail. The method grows a tree in conformational space reconciling two goals:(i) guidingthetreetowardslowerenergiesand(ii) notoversampling geometrically-similar <b>conformations.</b> Discretizations of the energy surface and a low-dimensional projection space are employed to select more often for expansion low-energy <b>conformations</b> in under-explored regions of the conformational space. The tree is expanded with low-energy <b>conformations</b> through a Metropolis Monte Carlo framework that uses a move set of physical fragment configurations. Testing on sequences of seven small-to-medium structurally-diverse proteins shows that the method rapidly samples native-like <b>conformations</b> {{in a few hours}} on a single CPU. Analysis shows that computed <b>conformations</b> are good candidates for further detailed energetic refinements by larger studies in protein engineering and design. I...|$|R

5|$|In glycolysis, {{hexokinase}} {{is directly}} inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and pyruvate kinase is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control {{point for the}} glycolytic pathway is phosphofructokinase (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The inhibition of PFK by ATP is unusual, since ATP is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by PFK; the active form of the enzyme is a tetramer that exists in two conformations, only one of which binds the second substrate fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The protein has two binding sites for ATP– the active site is accessible in either protein <b>conformation,</b> but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the <b>conformation</b> that binds F6P poorly. A number of other small molecules can compensate for the ATP-induced shift in equilibrium <b>conformation</b> and reactivate PFK, including cyclic AMP, ammonium ions, inorganic phosphate, and fructose-1,6- and -2,6-biphosphate.|$|E

5|$|Initially, geneticists {{assumed that}} the {{junction}} would adopt a parallel rather than antiparallel <b>conformation,</b> because that would place the homologous duplexes in closer alignment to each other. Chemical analysis in the 1980s showed that the junction actually preferred the antiparallel <b>conformation,</b> a finding that was considered controversial, and Robin Holliday himself initially doubted the findings. The antiparallel structure later became widely accepted due to X-ray crystallography data on in vitro molecules, although as of 2004 the implications for the in vivo structure remained unclear, especially {{the structure of the}} junctions is often altered by proteins bound to it.|$|E
40|$|During {{the process}} of {{pharmaceutical}} drug design, computational chemists often compute different lowenergy <b>conformations</b> of small drug molecules (ligands). Such <b>conformations</b> are used in solving docking problems [5] and in pharmacophore identification [3].

5|$|The {{conformational}} {{mobility of}} serpins provides a key advantage over static lock-and-key protease inhibitors.

40|$|The protein docking {{problem has}} two major aspects: {{sampling}} <b>conformations</b> and orientations, and scoring them for fit. To investigate {{the extent to}} which the protein docking problem may be attributed to the sampling of ligand side-chain <b>conformations,</b> multiple <b>conformations</b> of multiple residues were calculated for the uncomplexed (unbound) structures of protein ligands. These ligand <b>conformations</b> were docked into both the complexed (bound) and unbound <b>conformations</b> of the cognate receptors, and their energies were evaluated using an atomistic potential function. The following questions were considered: (1) does the ensemble of precalculated ligand <b>conformations</b> contain a structure similar to the bound form of the ligand? (2) Can the large number of <b>conformations</b> that are calculated be efficiently docked into the receptors? (3) Can near-native complexes be distinguished from non-native complexes? Results from seven test systems suggest that the precalculated ensembles do include side-chain <b>conformations</b> similar to those adopted in the experimental complexes. By assuming additivity among the side chains, the ensemble can be docked in less than 12 h on a desktop computer. These multiconformer dockings produce near-native complexes and also non-native complexes. When docked against the bound <b>conformations</b> of the receptors, the near-native complexes of the unbound ligand were always distinguishable from the non-native complexes. When docked against the unbound <b>conformations</b> of the receptors, the near-native dockings could usually, but not always, be distinguished from the non-native complexes. In every case, docking the unbound ligands with flexible side chains led to better energies and a better distinction between near-native and non-native fits. An extension of this algorithm allowed for docking multiple residue substitutions (mutants) in addition to multiple <b>conformations.</b> The rankings of the docked mutant proteins correlated with experimental binding affinities. These results suggest that sampling multiple residue <b>conformations</b> and residue substitutions of the unbound ligand contributes to, but does not fully provide, a solution to the protein docking problem. Conformational sampling allows a classical atomistic scoring function to be used; such a function may contribute to better selectivity between near-native and non-native complexes. Allowing for receptor flexibility may further extend these results...|$|R
