40|$|This study {{describes}} the ultrastructural {{differences between the}} compound eyes of ch li/ch li and Ch/ch li honeybee queens. Heterozygous "limão" bees had an almost normal ultrastructural organization of the ommatidia, {{but there were some}} alterations, including small vacuoles in the <b>crystalline</b> <b>cones</b> and a loss of pigment by primary pigmentary cells. In homozygous bees many ommatidia had very deformed <b>crystalline</b> <b>cones</b> and there were some bipartite rhabdoma. There was a reduction in the amount of pigment in the primary and secondary pigmentary cells and receptor cells (retinulae) of mutant eyes. However, the eyes of both heterozygous and homozygous queens had the same type of pigment granules. Certain membrane-limited structures containing pigment granules and electron-dense material appeared to be of lysosomal nature. Since these structures occurred in the retinular cells of mutant eyes, they were considered to be multivesicular bodies responsible for the reduction in rhabdom volume in the presence of light, as a type of adaptation to brightness. The reduction of pigment in the pigmentary and retinular cells and the morphological changes seen in the rhabdom of the ommatidia may originate visual deficiencies, which could explain the behavioral modifications reported for Apis mellifera queens with mutant eye color...|$|R
5000|$|The {{retinula}} (literally, [...] "small retina") {{cells of}} the ommatidium of the compound eye contain areas from which membranous organelles of conceivable size (rhabdomeres) extend. Rhabdomeres have tiny microvilli (tiny tubes extending out of the retinula) that interlock with neighboring retinular cells. This forms the rhabdom, which contains the dendrite of the eccentric cell, and may also contribute some microvilli. The only other species with an eccentric cell is the silkworm moth. Microvilli are composed of a double layer, 7 nm each and with 3.5 nm space of two electron-deficient boundaries in between. Where the microvilli meet, these outer borders fuse and yield five membranes about 15 nm thick. In all arthropods, {{there is always a}} rhabdom below a <b>crystalline</b> <b>cone,</b> on or {{near the center of the}} ommatidium, and always aligned with the path of light. At right angles to the length of the rhabdome are the length of the microvilli, which are in line with each other. The microvilli are about 40-150 nm in diameter.|$|E

40|$|The {{eyes of the}} euphausiids, a {{group of}} malacostracan Crustacea, show a re-markable {{similarity}} to the superposition (Exner, 1891) eyes of moths. In both groups the eye has an outer layer of <b>crystalline</b> <b>cones,</b> a wide clear zone, and a layer of rhabdomes beneath it, whose radius of curvature is about half that of the eye itself (Fig. 2 a). We demonstrated recently that image formation in these eyes is indeed performed by a refracting superposition mechanism (Land, Burton & Meyer-Rochow, 1979), as supposed by Chun (1896). That is to say, light is bent by the <b>crystalline</b> <b>cones</b> {{in such a way}} that a ray reaching the outer surface of a cone, and making an angle a with the cone axis, is bent in the cone through an angle 2 a (Fig. 1). This is the condition necessary if all parallel rays are to be brought to a focus in the rhabdome layer, where an erect image is produced (see Horridge, 1975). This mechanism, shared by moths, fireflies and some other beetles, is not the same as that of the decapod shrimps and prawns, where essentially the same trick is performed not by refracting cones, but by mirrors (Vogt, 1977; Land, 1978). Kampa (1965) proposed that the euphausiid eye was basically of the apposition type...|$|R

40|$|Conspicuous, bright colorations {{of insect}} {{compound}} eyes {{may be caused}} by two different mechanisms resulting in different functions: 1) A thin layer of bright, light scattering pigment inside the pigment cells bordering cornea and <b>crystalline</b> <b>cones</b> may determine the eye’s outer appearance when seen through the transparent dioptric apparatus. The insect’s vision is not influenced by this phenomenon (STAVENGA 1979). The cornea transmits light equally well for all wavelengths involved in vision. As examples Ischnura elegans VAN DER LINDEN (Odonata: Coenagrionidae) and Lathyrophthalmus aeneus (SCOPOLI) (Diptera: Syrphidae) are presented. 2) Interference filters in the cornea cause colorful, metallic reflections. Transmission measurements of single cornea lenses revealed that the interference filters act as color filters by reducing transmission of light in a small limited waveband. These filters influence vision, because they change the spectral composition of visual stimuli.

40|$|Each of the {{approximately}} 500 ommatidia in the compound eye of the cladoceran crustacean Leptodora kindtii has a <b>crystalline</b> <b>cone</b> consisting of five cells. Five retinula cells are also present, one of which contributes to the distal 1 – 2 μm of the rhabdom only; the other four retinula cells form a continuous rhabdom. Throughout the rhabdom its cross section displays two separate halves with the axis of the microvilli in one half perpendicular {{to that in the}} other (orthogonal pattern). Interferometric analysis of the refractive index of the <b>crystalline</b> <b>cone</b> revealed an inhomogeneous system with one distal and one proximal gradient. The gradient system was found to exclude rays entering from adjacent facets, thus maintaining the optical isolation. Consequently, these optics replace distal screening pigment, which is absent in the eye. The long and unscreened crystalline cones give rise to an almost transparent eye in conformity with the overall transparency of this planktonic animal. The morphological characteristics of the eye of this species deviate from other cladoceran eyes, but the optical design closely resembles that of some pelagic marine amphipod crustaceans...|$|E
40|$|The {{arthropod}} compound eye differs fundamentally {{from the}} vertebrate eye, both morphologically and functionally. In insects it is constructed {{of a number}} of units called ommatidia, each consisting of about eight elongate retinula cells arranged around a central axis, the rhabdom (Text-fig. 1). Surrounding the retinula cells is a sleeve of pigment cells which probably serves to isolate, structurally and optically, the different ommatidia. The proximal ends of the ommatidia rest on a basement membrane, below which lies the optic ganglion and through which penetrate nerve fibers and branches of the tracheal system. At the distal end of each ommatidium is a transparent conical structure, the <b>crystalline</b> <b>cone,</b> the consistency of which varies considerably among the different groups of insects. Overlying the crystalline cones and directly in contact with the external world is the cornea, a transparent layer whose surface is sculptured into numerous tiny facets, one for each ommatidium.

40|$|Ants of the Australian genus Myrmecia {{partition}} their foraging niche temporally, {{allowing them}} to be sympatric with overlapping foraging requirements. We used histological techniques to study the light and dark adaptation mechanisms in the compound eyes of diurnal (Myrmecia croslandi), crepuscular (M. tarsata, M. nigriceps) and nocturnal ants (M. pyriformis). We found that, except in the day-active species, all ants have a variable primary pigment cell pupil that constricts the <b>crystalline</b> <b>cone</b> in bright light to control for light flux. We show for the nocturnal M. pyriformis that the constriction of the <b>crystalline</b> <b>cone</b> by the primary pigment cells is light dependent whereas {{the opening of the}} aperture is regulated by an endogenous rhythm. In addition, in the light-adapted eyes of all species, the retinular cell pigment granules radially migrate towards the rhabdom, a process that in both the day-active M. croslandi and the night-active M. pyriformis is driven by ambient light intensity. Visual system properties thus do not restrict crepuscular and night-active ants to their temporal foraging niche, while day-active ants require high light intensities to operate. We discuss the ecological significance of these adaptation mechanisms and their role in temporal niche partitioning. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} of {{the compound}} eyes of 13 amphipod species has been investigated. An amphipod type of compound eye can be characterized by the constellation and consistency {{of a number of}} morphological features, most of which are also found in other compound eyes. The amphipod eye falls into four sub-categories (types). The ampeliscid type has a tripartite aberrant lens eye; the lysianassid type has a reduced or no dioptric apparatus and a hypertrophied rhabdom; the hyperid type possesses a large number of ommatidial units with long <b>crystalline</b> <b>cones</b> and dark instead of reflecting accessory pigment; and finally, the gammarid type can be interpreted as a generalized amphipod type. The lysianassid type is adapted to low light intensities and demonstrates convergent development with the compound eyes of other deep-sea crustaceans. The ampeliscid type is more similar to the gammarid type. The type characterization of the amphipod compound eye might well serve as a basis and incentive for functional studies also revealing adaptational mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|SummaryStomatopod crustaceans, or mantis shrimp, are {{renowned for}} their complex visual systems. Their array of 16 types of photoreceptors {{provides}} complex color reception, {{as well as}} linear and circular polarization sensitivity [1 – 6]. The least-understood components of their retina are the UV receptors, {{of which there are}} up to six distinct, narrowly tuned spectral types [4]. Here we show that in the stomatopod species Neogonodactylus oerstedii, this set of receptors is based on only two visual pigments. Surprisingly, five of the six UV receptor types contain the same visual pigment. The various UV receptors are spectrally tuned by a novel set of four short- and long-pass UV-specific optical filters in the overlying <b>crystalline</b> <b>cones.</b> These filters are composed of various mycosporine-like amino acid (MAA) pigments. Commonly referred to as “nature’s sunscreens,” MAAs are usually employed for UV photoprotection [7, 8], but mantis shrimp uniquely incorporate them into powerful spectral tuning filters, extending and diversifying their preeminently elaborate photoreceptive arsenal.

However, a slight departure from a strictly nocturnal mode of life is indicated by the high degree of orthogonally-arranged rhabdom microvilli of approximately 50 nm in diameter and the absence of a tracheal tapetum. It is concluded that the basis for e-vector detection is present in 0. posticus, and, therefore, astro-orientation to maintain a straight path is possible.

40|$|The <b>crystalline</b> <b>cone</b> of beetles and moths is a transparent, solid {{structure}} {{consisting of}} {{a small number of}} concentrated, hydrophobic proteins. Among these polypeptides is a 67 kD protein family which are found in the cones of all 9 species examined. In addition, beetle lenses contain a 125 kD polypeptide that is immunologically related to a moth 100 kD lens polypeptide. The high molecular weight polypeptides may also be related to the 67 kD family because (i) antibodies raised against the beetle 67 kD polypeptide cross-react with the moth 67 kD and 100 kD polypeptides, and with the beetle 125 kD polypeptide, (ii) enzyme digests of 67 kD and 100 kD moth polypeptides yield a number of products of identical mass, and (iii) the purified 67 and 100 kD polypeptides dissociate into subunits of similar molecular weight.;The profiles of <b>crystalline</b> <b>cone</b> proteins in lepidopterans and beetles may result from the cone being formed differently.

40|$|Aspects of the {{morphology}} {{and optical}} physiology of reflecting superposition eyes {{have been investigated}} using species from various decapod crustacean taxa. The eyes {{all have the same}} basic structure of a distal dioptric layer and a proximal retinula layer, separated by an unpigmented clear zone. In the eyes of shrimps, lobsters and crayfish the clear zone is crossed by <b>crystalline</b> <b>cone</b> cell extensions. In squat lobsters this region is crossed by rhabdomeric lightguides. Porcelain crabs possess an eye intermediate in design. The superposition ray path, the action of corneal lenses and the presence of lightguides have been demonstrated and the refractive indices of several optical elements determined. These results have been used to produce ray tracing diagrams showing the optical pathways within these eyes. All of the eyes function by redirecting light across the clear zone by reflection within a mirrored <b>crystalline</b> <b>cone.</b> In squat lobsters a rhabdomeric lightguide transmits axial light to the rhabdoms. The eyes have a small f-number resulting in good light-gathering power and maximum sensitivity. However, intracellular electrophysiological determinations of retinula cell angular sensitivity show that these eyes have poor resolution. Variations in morphology and optics represent adaptations to the underwater light field, especially in the tapeta and in the light- sensitive rhabdoms. In oceanic species the tapetum varies in both structure and reflectivity along a dorso-ventral gradient within each eye and also interspecifically. It is proposed that the need to remain well-camouflaged in the low-contrast oceanic environment leads to tapetal modifications. Where sufficient light is available the rhabdoms are adapted to maximize resolution and permit sensitivity to polarized light. In deeper water, where little light remains, the rhabdoms are adapted to increase sensitivity at the expense of resolution. The dorsal region of the eye retains apposition optics for the purpose of detecting small objects in silhouette against the downwelling light...|$|E
40|$|The discrete, subthreshold, slow {{potential}} fluctuations (SPF's) {{which can be}} recorded intracellularly in Limulus ommatidia are sensitive to temperature and light wavelength. SPF frequency increases with increasing temperature (Q 10 about 3. 5) and light intensity. The effects are additive. SPF rise and decay time decrease with increasing temperature (Q 10 between 2 and 3). There is a peak, near 520 nm, in the spectral sensitivity of SPF frequency. This peak may correspond to the wavelength of maximum absorption by rhodopsin in the ommatidia. Hydroxylamine produces a rapid, irreversible reduction of SPF frequency and amplitude perhaps owing to its action on the photopigment. The cornea and <b>crystalline</b> <b>cones</b> fluoresce (peak about 445 nm) when excited by near-ultraviolet energy (380 nm peak) and this fluorescence may influence SPF spectral sensitivity measurements. These {{findings suggest that the}} SPF's are the results of photolytic and thermolytic reactions occurring in the ommatidial visual pigments and that they have a role in the mechanisms which transduce light to electrical activity in the visual receptors...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY A broad {{survey of}} mantis shrimp reveals {{variability}} in ocular UV-filters, suggesting a complex evolutionary history for these pigments, and even greater visual complexity than previously appreciated in this group. Stomatopod crustaceans employ unique ultraviolet (UV) optical filters {{in order to}} tune the spectral sensitivities of their UV-sensitive photoreceptors. In the stomatopod species Neogonodactylus oerstedii, we previously found four filter types, produced by five distinct mycosporine-like amino acid pigments in the <b>crystalline</b> <b>cones</b> of their specialized midband ommatidial facets. This UV-spectral tuning array produces receptors with at least six distinct spectral sensitivities, despite expressing only two visual pigments. Here we present a broad survey of these UV filters across the stomatopod order, examining their spectral absorption properties in twenty-one species from seven families in four superfamilies. We found that UV filters are present {{in three of the}} four superfamilies, and evolutionary character reconstruction implies that at least one class of UV filter was present in the ancestor of all modern stomatopods. Additionally, postlarval stomatopods were observed to produce the UV filter...|$|R
40|$|Stomatopod {{crustaceans}} {{have the}} most complex and diverse assortment of retinal photoreceptors of any animals, with 16 functional classes. The receptor classes are subdivided into sets responsible for ultraviolet vision, spatial vision, colour vision and polarization vision. Many of these receptor classes are spectrally tuned by filtering pigments located in photoreceptors or overlying optical elements. At visible wavelengths, carotenoproteins or similar substances are packed into vesicles used either as serial, intrarhabdomal filters or lateral filters. A single retina may contain a diversity of these filtering pigments paired with specific photoreceptors, and the pigments used vary between and within species both taxonomically and ecologically. Ultraviolet- filtering pigments in the <b>crystalline</b> <b>cones</b> serve to tune ultraviolet vision in these animals as well, and some ultraviolet receptors themselves act as birefringent filters to enable circular polarization vision.

40|$|A {{structural}} {{analysis of the}} compound eye of Hemigrapsus nudus expands the basis of functional analysis of decapod Crustacean eyes. Contradictory evidence for disintegration of rhabdomeric microvilli {{in the absence of}} light prompted observation of H. nudus eyes after 146 days in darkness. Eyes were fixed with formalin and glutaraldehyde and post fixed with osmium tetroxide for electron and light microscopy. Light- dark-adapted eyes were also observed with hot water fixation and paraffin embedment. The eye of H. nudus is typical of decapod Crustacean compound eyes. Corneagenous cells underlie the transparent cuticle cone cells secrete the composite <b>crystalline</b> <b>cone</b> which contacts the rhabdom proximally. The single fused rhabdom is composed of layers of microvilli from two groups of retinular cells. The layers are oriented at right angles to each other, and perpendicular to the optic axis of the ommatidium. A presumptive four-lobed eighth retinular cell makes up the distal end of the rhabdom. Distal, proximal and reflecting retinal pigments are located in the distal pigment cells, retinular cells and tapetal cells, respectively. Distal and proximal pigments surround the rhabdom during light-adaptation, and withdraw during dark-adaptation. Reflecting pigment is found above the basement membrane in light-adapted eyes and below it in dark-adapted eyes. The <b>crystalline</b> <b>cone</b> may change length during light- and dark-adaptation. Prolonged darkness does not cause disintegration of the rhabdomeric microvilli. H. nudus lives in conditions of dim illumination. The fused, layered rhabdom is an efficient mechanism of light absorption. Internal reflection within the rhabdom is enhanced by the palisade and further increases light absorption. Functional units exist within the ommatidium. Mutually perpendicular rhabdomeric layers suggest intraretinal polarized light perception. Eighth retinular cells may respond individually to light focused on the distal rhabdom by the dioptric apparatus in mosaic image formation...|$|E

40|$|Among {{the curious}} eyes {{found in nature}} {{is that of a}} little known marine {{crustacean}}, Copilia, a copepod, which is about X 1 X 3 mm. This copepod is found in the Mediterranean and Caribbean Seas. In 1963, while we were working on crustacean eyes at the Zoological Research Station, Naples, Italy, Professor J. Z. Young brought to our attention this animal and its unusual eyes. Only the female of the species possesses these remarkable eyes which make up more than half of its transparent body. The eye of Copilia (Mediterranean) was described in 1879 by Grenacher (6) and in 1891 by Exner (1) who made measurements of its optical system. Recently Vaissire (8, 9) and Gregory (3, 4) and his collaborators (5) have made studies of the eye and the behavior of Copilia. Each eye appears as the single ommatidium of a compound eye (sometimes referred to as ocelli in copepods) with a corneal lens, <b>crystalline</b> <b>cone,</b> and retinula cells that form its rhabdom (Figs. 1 and 4). The rhabdom lies in a pigmented stem that oscillates back and forth (Fig. 4).

40|$|Superposition {{eyes are}} {{generally}} thought to function ideally when {{the eye is}} spherical and with rhabdom tips in the focal plane of the imaging optics of facet lenses and <b>crystalline</b> <b>cones.</b> Anatomical data as well as direct optical measurements demonstrate that the superposition eyes of moths and skippers often deviate severely from the expected ideal case. Part of the deviation {{has been attributed to}} diffraction at the single facet lens, which was taken to be an essential limit to spatial resolution, because light traveling through different facet lenses was assumed to be incoherent. By considering the two-dimensional facet lens lattice, it is here demonstrated that many facets within a superposition aperture transmit coherent light, allowing a much sharper image than possible with single facet lens diffraction. Partial coherence therefore is an important aspect of superposition imaging. It is argued that broadening of the photoreceptor acceptance angles occurs because of optical errors in the facet lens-crystalline cone system other than diffraction. The transmittance of the superposition aperture of moths and skippers is improved by the corneal nipple arrays of the facet lenses, but quantitative assessment shows that the effect is minor. ...|$|R

We find the ants have developed large lenses (33 µm in diameter) and wide rhabdoms (5 µm in diameter) to make their eyes highly sensitive to low light conditions. To be active at bright light conditions, the ants have developed an extreme pupillary mechanism during which the primary pigment cells constrict the <b>crystalline</b> <b>cone</b> to form a narrow tract of 0. 5 µm wide and 16 µm long. This pupillary mechanism protects the photoreceptors from bright light, making the eyes less sensitive during the day. The dorsal rim area of their compound eye has specialised photoreceptors that could aid in detecting the orientation of the pattern of polarised skylight, which would assist the animals to determine compass directions required while navigating between nest and food sources...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} {{and development of}} ommatidia has been examined in Oncopeltus fasciatus (Lygaeidae). Each ommatidium is composed of 18 cells comprising four <b>crystalline</b> <b>cone</b> cells, two primary pigment cells, four secondary pigment cells and eight retinula cells. Ommatidia are of the apposition type and the retinula cells are arranged on the open rhabdomere plan. During the five larval stages the retina grows anteriorly to provide a 12 -fold increase in numbers of ommatidia. Grafts of presumptive eye epidermis show that the proliferating anterior border of the developing retina {{is an area of}} epidermal cell recruitment rather than a special budding zone. Mosaic retinae were formed by grafting epidermis from near the eye of wild-type donors into the corresponding region of mutant hosts. Ommatidia which developed at the borders of the graft contained mixtures of wild-type and mutant cells in variable and unpredictable combinations. Similar mosaic structures were seen in retinae generated by irradiation at early stages of development. The suggestion that each ommatidium is clonally derived from a single epidermal stem cell is thus disproved. The frequent occurrence of mosaic ommatidia containing only one cell of a different genotype from the rest suggests that the formation of ommatidial clusters follows the main proliferative phase of eye growth. We conclude that cell determination within ommatidia is not connected with lineage but is dependant upon cell position within the developing ommatidium...|$|E
40|$|The {{decay of}} a <b>crystalline</b> <b>cone</b> below the {{roughening}} transition is studied. We consider local mass transport through surface diffusion, {{focusing on the}} two cases of diffusion limited and attachment-detachment limited step kinetics. In both cases, we describe the decay kinetics in terms of step flow models. Numerical simulations of the models indicate that in the attachment-detachment limited case the system undergoes a step bunching instability if the repulsive interactions between steps are weak. Such an instability does not occur in the diffusion limited case. In stable cases the height profile, h(r,t), is flat at radii r<R(t) ∼ t^ 1 / 4. Outside this flat region the height profile obeys the scaling scenario ∂ h/∂ r = F(r t^- 1 / 4). A scaling ansatz for the time-dependent profile of the cone yields analytical values for the scaling exponents and a differential equation for the scaling function. In the long time limit this equation provides an exact description of the discrete step dynamics. It admits a family of solutions and the mechanism responsible for {{the selection of a}} unique scaling function is discussed in detail. Finally we generalize the model and consider permeable steps by allowing direct adatom hops between neighboring terraces. We argue that step permeability does not change the scaling behavior of the system, and its only effect is a renormalization of some of the parameters. Comment: 25 pages, 18 postscript figure...|$|E
40|$|We have {{critically}} {{evaluated the}} deposition parameter space {{of very high}} frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition discharges near the amorphous to crystalline transition for intrinsic a-Si:H passivation layers on Si (1 [*] 1 [*] 1) wafers. Using a low silane concentration in the SiH 4 –H 2 feedstock gas mixture that created amorphous material just before the transition, we have obtained samples with excellent surface passivation. Also, an a-Si:H matrix was grown with embedded local epitaxial growth of <b>crystalline</b> <b>cones</b> on a Si (1 [*] 1 [*] 1) substrate, as was revealed with a combined scanning electron and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy study. This local epitaxial growth was introduced by a decrease of the silane concentration in the feedstock gas or an increase in discharge power at low silane concentration. Together with the samples on Si (1 [*] 1 [*] 1) substrates, layers were co-deposited on Si (1 [*] 0 [*] 0) substrates. This resulted in void-rich, mono-crystalline epitaxial layers on Si (1 [*] 0 [*] 0). The epitaxial growth on Si (1 [*] 0 [*] 0) was compared to the local epitaxial growth on Si (1 [*] 1 [*] 1). The sparse surface coverage of cones seeded on the Si (1 [*] 1 [*] 1) substrate is most probably enabled {{by a combination of}} nucleation at steps and kinks in the { 1 [*] 1 [*] 1 } surface and intense ion bombardment at low silane concentration. The effective carrier lifetime of this sample is low and does not increase upon post-deposition annealing. Thus, sparse local epitaxial growth on Si (1 [*] 1 [*] 1) is enough to obstruct crystalline silicon surface passivation by amorphous silicon...|$|R

40|$|The orderly packing {{and precise}} {{arrangement}} of epithelial cells {{is essential to}} the functioning of many tissues, and refinement of this packing during development is a central theme in animal morphogenesis. The mechanisms that determine epithelial cell shape and position, however, remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigate these mechanisms in a striking example of planar order in a vertebrate epithelium: The periodic, almost <b>crystalline</b> distribution of <b>cone</b> photoreceptors in the adult teleost fish retina. Based on observations of the emergence of photoreceptor packing near the retinal margin, we propose a mathematical model in which ordered columns of cells form as a result of coupling between planar cell polarity (PCP) and anisotropic tissue-scale mechanical stresses. This model recapitulates many observed features of cone photoreceptor organization during retinal growth and regeneration. Consistent with the model’s predictions, we report a planar-polarized distribution of Crumbs 2 a protein in cone photoreceptors in both unperturbed and regenerated tissue. We further show that the pattern perturbations predicted by the model to occur if the imposed stresses become isotropic closely resemble defects in the cone pattern in zebrafish lrp 2 mutants, in which intraocular pressure is increased, resulting in altered mechanical stress and ocular enlargement. Evidence of interactions linking PCP, cell shape, and mechanical stresses has recently emerged in a number of systems, several of which show signs of columnar cell packing akin to that described here. Our results may hence have broader relevance for the organization of cells in epithelia. Wherea...|$|R
