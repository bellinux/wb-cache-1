Briefly, on January 22, 1985, the reactor top CAM showed the presence of low-level particulate radioactivity. Gamma spectroscopy analysis of the filter indicated that short-lived fission products could be contributing to the elevated CAM readings. An exact determination could not be made due to the low count rates observed (typically < 0. 01 counts per second).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if the alpha energy spectrum in a Passive Implanted Planar Silicon (PIPS) detector, as modeled by MCNPX [1], can be used to design a radon stripping algorithm for a <b>continuous</b> <b>air</b> <b>monitor</b> (CAM). This stripping algorithm would be employed to discriminate naturally occurring radioisotopes from the anthropogenic for nuclear safety -related applications. It is hoped that using an algorithm based on MCNPX simulations, the CAM will not be prone to false alarms when radon levels are dynamic as identified in other CAM systems [2, 3]. This work is focused on the design of the next generation air particulate detector (NGAPD) for the United States Navy. The primary isotope of interest is Co- 60. This radionuclide emits a beta with an average energy of 96 keV. Therefore, once deposited on the CAM filter, it will produce a beta continuum seen by the PIPS detector. In addition, as radon progeny is deposited on the air filter, these will give rise to characteristic alpha peaks and a beta continuum. This is primarily an issue in port-or land-based applications. Ultimately, measurement of a radon alpha spectrum is desired to predict the amount of beta activity which would be measured from the radon progeny decay chains. All excess beta activity could then be attributed to anthropogenic sources once the radon progeny contributions have been stripped out...|$|E

As of May 1, 1998 (1 / 2 year into the project) the research-prototype 30 -cm pulsed ionization chamber (PIC) is assembled and operational with an alpha particle energy resolution of better than 45 keV for 5 -MeV alpha particles. Measurements of spectral resolution for alpha particles from radon decay products have been made {{as a function of}} filter type and dust loading conditions. So far, a study of ten filter types has found that the best combination of resolution and throughput is obtained with 3. 0 65 m Millipore fluoropore and 1. 0 65 m Corning FNMB filters. Experiments with gypsum and Portland cement dust in the size range 1 to 20 65 m indicate significant degradation in alpha particle resolution for dust loading above about 0. 5 mg cmsup - 2.

On December 19, 1996, an accidental release of plutonium aerosol occurred into a laboratory in the CMR building. The event occurred while the room was unoccupied, and no personnel were exposed from this incident. There were two fixed air samplers (FASs) and three CAMs operating in the room at the time the release occurred, including two of the recently installed Canberra Alpha Sentry CAMs and one older Eberline CAM.

The upper and lower vaults are connected by exhauster ports, which allow airflow between the two sections.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A new rugged <b>continuous</b> <b>air</b> <b>monitor</b> (CAM) for sampling radionuclide has been developed. The sampler was designed for analyzing aerosols from occupied environments of laboratories and samples extracted from stacks and ducts. Experiments were conducted to characterize the collection efficiency of the aerosol sampler system and to characterize the uniformity of particulate deposition on the filter surface as affected by variations in particle size and sampler flow rates. An experimental parametric analysis was conducted to determine the best internal geometric flow configuration, in order to achieve optimum aerosol collection. The results showed that at a flow rate of 56. 6 L/min, 90 % of 10 []m aerodynamic diameter (AD) aerosol particles penetrated through the sampler. The 10 % loss was attributed to particle impaction at the location where the aerosol stream is turned from the vertical direction and then enters a 4 mm gap between a sampler filter and a planar detector, both of which are horizontally oriented. The cut point for the sampler was 20 []m AD. Uniformity of aerosol collection on the filter, as characterized by the coefficient of variation of the areal density deposits, was less than 10 % for 10 []m AD aerosol particles. The sampler sealing integrity with respect to air leaks was tested by placing the sampler in a pressurized container and operating the sampler with the pressure in the container higher than that in the sampler for in-leakage, and with the pressure in the container less than that in the sampler for out-leakage. The pressure inside the container did not exceed 10 inches of water. For in-leakage tests, sulfur hexafluoride (SF?) was diluted with air and released into the container, external to the sampler. The ratio of the SF? concentration in the sampler to the SF? concentration in the container was calculated to characterize the integrity of the sampler system. For pressure differences of 5 and 10 inches of water, the in-leakage was 0. 03 % and 0. 02 %, respectively. The same procedure was repeated for out-leakage except that the diluted SF? was released into the sampler.

Monitoring radionuclide effluents has historically been recognized as an important operational activity and a mandatory requirement. US DOE facilities generally require that a <b>continuous</b> <b>air</b> <b>monitor</b> (CAM) instrument be installed to provide an alarm for safety purposes, and that a fixed air sampler (AS) be installed to provide emissions quantification information for both compliance and liability functions. It is very important that aerosol losses in the sampling systems be minimal for the Cams to provide prompt and reliable alarms and that FASs yield data that accurately characterize the emissions. Recognizing that the particle sampling characteristics have a significant role in determining the ability of sampler to properly signal an alarm, this study was conducted to characterize the collection efficiency of aerosol sampler systems as affected by variations in particle size and sampler flow rate. The results presented deal with the aerosol sampling aspects of an overall sampling system, which consists of an inlet-elbow, a transport line, and a EL- 900 CAM prototype manufactured by EG&G. Results show that only 12 % of 10 []m aerodynamic diameter (AD) aerosol particles penetrate through the complete sampling system when it is operated at flow rate of 84. 9 L/min in a free stream velocity of 9 m/s. About 88 % of the losses occurred on the internal walls of the inlet-elbow probe and about 10 % in the transport line. The EL- 900 has a cutpoint larger than 20 []m AD and a penetration of 88 % for 10 m AD aerosol particles when operated at 84. 9 L/min. Deposition of 10 []m AD aerosol particles at the EL- 900 take place primarily {{in the center of the}} filter, where the counting efficiency of the detector is highest. A FAS has been developed for sampling radionuclide aerosol particles from the workplace. Wind tunnel testing was used to verify sampling performance. When the sampler was oriented at O' over various ranges of free stream velocities, sampling flow rates and particle sizes, the aspiration efficiency of aerosol was typically greater than 95 %.

(SEA), under {{contract}} No. DE-AC 26 - 00 NT 40768, was tasked by the US Department of Energy [...] National Energy Technology Laboratory {{to develop and}} test a near real-time beryllium monitor for airborne and surface measurements. Recent {{public awareness of the}} health risks associated with exposure to beryllium has underscored the need for better, faster beryllium monitoring capabilities within the DOE. A near real-time beryllium monitor will offer significant improvements over the baseline monitoring technology currently in use. Whereas the baseline technology relies upon collecting an air sample on a filter and the subsequent analysis of the filter by an analytical laboratory, this effort developed a monitor that offers near real-time measurement results while work is in progress. Since the baseline typically only offers after-the-fact documentation of exposure levels, the near real-time capability provides a significant increase in worker protection. The beryllium monitor developed utilizes laser induced breakdown spectroscopy, or LIBS as the fundamental measurement technology. LIBS has been used in a variety of laboratory and field based instrumentation to provide real-time, and near-real-time elemental analysis capabilities. LIBS is an analytical technique where a pulsed high energy laser beam is focused to a point on the sample to be interrogated. The high energy density produces a small high temperature plasma plume, sometimes called a spark. The conditions within this plasma plume result in the constituent atoms becoming excited and emitting their characteristic optical emissions. The emission light is collected and routed to an optical spectrometer for quantitative spectral analysis. Each element has optical emissions, or lines, of a specific wavelength {{that can be used to}} uniquely identify that element. In this application, the intensity of the beryllium emission is used to provide a quantitative measure of the abundance of the element in the sample. The monitor can be operated in one of two modes, as a <b>continuous</b> <b>air</b> <b>monitor</b> (CAM), or as a wipe monitor. In its CAM mode, the monitor collects an air sample for a user programmable sampling time on a conventional mixed cellulose ester (MCE) filter. The monitor can also be used in a wipe analysis mode, where the user can load up to 60 previously collected wipe samples, typically obtained on 47 mm filter media, into disposable filter cassettes. Under this effort, a beryllium monitor was designed, fabricated and tested. During laboratory testing, the monitor's measurement performance met the stated measurement objectives at the outset of the project. A typical minimum detectable beryllium mass for the monitor is below the 0. 2 mg/m{sup 3 } goal of the project. Field-testing of the monitor show it to exhibit extremely good sensitivity to very low levels of beryllium. On a per spark basis, the monitor has been shown to be capable of detecting a few tens of picograms of beryllium. At the culmination of the project, the beryllium CAM unit was delivered to the U. S.

A subcontractor was tasked with the development fabrication. and testing of a sampling device that would be able to obtain multiple samples from the material on the annulus floor. as well as the material originating from a refractory air-slot near the floor of the annulus space. This sampler would need to be able to collect and dispense the material it collected into a sample jar retrieval device for transportation of the material to the 222 -S laboratory on the Hanford site for analysis. The subcontractor agency fabricated a remote underground sampler by modifying off-the-shelf robotics and parts. Limited testing of the sampler was conducted using a mock-up of the tank annulus and one simulated material type -a salt block. The mock-up testing indicated that the sampler would be able to maneuver within the confined space and that the device worked with full functionality. A total of six weeks had passed from initiation to implementation of the new sampler in the 241 -AY- 102 tank annulus. Initial sample material was obtained from the annulus floor using the Off-Riser Sampler System that has been used at Hanford tor years to obtain material from the primary tanks. This could be used at the location near Riser 83 since the material was collected directly from the annulus floor and not from a location on the wall or behind a pipe, as was needed from the two locations near Riser 90. After obtaining a small sample of the material on the annulus floor. this sampler sustained terminal damage due to conduit pipes it had to transverse in order to collect and recover material from this location. Several issues were also encountered during deployment of the new sampler into the annulus near Riser 90. These included: • Difficulty fitting the sampler down the 12 -inch riser into the annulus due to a small tolerance in the size ofthe sampler • Failure of sampler components and functions during deployment including the camera. pneumatics. and bearing seals • Delays in the field due to supporting equipment issues including cables. cameras. and scaffolding • Low recovery of sample material obtained for analysis The complications that occurred during deployment and use of the new sampler during the sampling event ultimately resulted in lower recovery of material from these locations in the annulus than was obtained using the Off-Riser Sampler System and limited the analyses that could be performed for determining the origin of the material. Following completion of the sample analyses and the assessment of its construction history and use. there was a consensus among the leak assessment team members that two of the three materials sampled from the annulus floor region were the result of waste leaking from a breach in the primary tank. The probable leak cause was identified as corrosion at high temperatures in a tank whose containment margins had been reduced due to construction difficulties (RPP-ASMT- 53793). A formal Lessons Learned was created concerning designing equipment tor unique purposes under time constraints. This document was published in OPEXShare on May 20. 2013. It highlighted some of the issues that arose with the subcontractor sampler development and provided recommendations to prevent a recurrence should this task need to be performed again in the future.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Continuous</b> ambient <b>air</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{systems have}} been {{introduced}} worldwide. However, such monitoring forces autonomous communities to bear a significant financial burden. Thus, {{it is important to}} identify pollutant-monitoring stations that are less efficient, while minimizing loss of data quality and mitigating effects on the determination of spatiotemporal trends of pollutants. This study describes a procedure for optimizing a constant ambient <b>air</b> <b>monitoring</b> system in the Kanto region of Japan. Constant ambient <b>air</b> <b>monitoring</b> stations in the area were topologically classified into four groups by cluster analysis and principle component analysis.

40|$|Although {{vacuum pumps}} on <b>continuous</b> <b>air</b> <b>monitors</b> (CAMs) {{do not produce}} noise levels above {{regulatory}} limits, engineering controls were used to establish a safer work environment. Operations performed in areas where CAMs are located are highly specialized and require precision work when handling nuclear materials, heavy metals, and inert gases. Traditional methods for controlling noise such as enclosing or isolating the source {{and the use of}} personal protection equipment were evaluated. An innovative solution was found by retrofitting CAMs with air powered multistage ejectors pumps. By allowing the air to expand in several chambers to create a vacuum, one can eliminate the noise hazard altogether. In facilities with adequate pressurized air, use of these improved ejector pumps may be a cost-effective replacement for noisy vacuum pumps. A workplace designed or engineered with noise levels as low as possible or as close to background adds to increased concentration, attention to detail, and increased production...|$|R

Responding to public perceptions and concerns about air quality remains a challenge and requires sound assessment. It is of great interest to know whether changes in air quality have occurred over time in areas where economic development is on going and <b>continuous</b> <b>air</b> <b>monitoring</b> is conducted. Assessment of trends offers a sound scientific approach for responding to public perceptions and concerns about air quality and establishing whether or not change is occurring. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the extent to which concentrations of ambient air quality parameters have changed (trends) over a period of 7 to 8 years at two West Central Airshed Society (WCAS) stations in central Alberta: i) Tomahawk (from 1997 to 2004) and ii) Carrot Creek (from 1998 to 2004). These stations are on the eastern side of the airshed within elevations 700 to 1000 m above sea level. While they are both located in predominantly rural areas, anthropogenic activities – oil and gas wells, gas processing plants, coal-fired power plants – occur in the area...|$|R
