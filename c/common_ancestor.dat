5|$|In phylogenetic taxonomy, {{the genus}} Triceratops {{has been used}} as a {{reference}} point in the definition of Dinosauria; dinosaurs have been designated as all descendants of the most recent <b>common</b> <b>ancestor</b> of Triceratops and Neornithes (i.e. modern birds). Furthermore, the bird-hipped dinosaurs, Ornithischia, have all been designated dinosaurs with a more recent <b>common</b> <b>ancestor</b> to Triceratops than modern birds.|$|E
5|$|Lice {{have been}} the subject of {{significant}} DNA research in the 2000s that led to discoveries on human evolution. The three species of sucking lice that parasitize human beings belong to two genera, Pediculus and Pthirus: head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis), body lice (Pediculus humanus corporis), and pubic lice (Pthirus pubis). Human head and body lice (genus Pediculus) share a <b>common</b> <b>ancestor</b> with chimpanzee lice, while pubic lice (genus Pthirus) share a <b>common</b> <b>ancestor</b> with gorilla lice. Using phylogenetic and cophylogenetic analysis, Reed et al. hypothesized that Pediculus and Pthirus are sister taxa and monophyletic. In other words, the two genera descended from the same <b>common</b> <b>ancestor.</b> The age of divergence between Pediculus and its <b>common</b> <b>ancestor</b> is estimated to be 6-7 million years ago, which matches the age predicted by chimpanzee-hominid divergence. Because parasites rely on their hosts, host-parasite cospeciation events are likely.|$|E

5|$|The {{study of}} early dinosaurs such as Herrerasaurus and Eoraptor {{therefore}} {{has important implications}} for the concept of dinosaurs as a monophyletic group (a group descended from a <b>common</b> <b>ancestor).</b> The monophyly of dinosaurs was explicitly proposed in the 1970s by Galton and Robert T. Bakker, who compiled a list of cranial and postcranial synapomorphies (common anatomical traits derived from the <b>common</b> <b>ancestor).</b> Later authors proposed additional synapomorphies. An extensive study of Herrerasaurus by Sereno in 1992 suggested that of these proposed synapomorphies, only one cranial and seven postcranial features were actually derived from a <b>common</b> <b>ancestor,</b> and that the others were attributable to convergent evolution. Sereno's analysis of Herrerasaurus also led him to propose several new dinosaurian synapomorphies.|$|E
5|$|A central {{organizing}} {{concept in}} biology is that life changes and develops through evolution, {{and that all}} life-forms known have a common origin. The theory of evolution postulates that all organisms on the Earth, both living and extinct, have descended from a <b>common</b> <b>ancestor</b> or an ancestral gene pool. This universal <b>common</b> <b>ancestor</b> of all organisms {{is believed to have}} appeared about 3.5 billion years ago. Biologists regard the ubiquity of the genetic code as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (see: origin of life).|$|E

5|$|DNA {{sequences}} can be {{mapped to}} reveal a phylogenetic tree that represents evolutionary relationships, with each branch point representing the divergence of two lineages from a <b>common</b> <b>ancestor.</b> On this tree the term basal is used to describe a lineage that forms a branch diverging nearest to the <b>common</b> <b>ancestor.</b> Wolf genetic sequencing has found the Beringian wolf to be basal to all other gray wolves except for the modern Indian gray wolf and Himalayan wolf, and the extinct Belgian clade of Pleistocene wolves.|$|E

50|$|Because {{ancestors}} of the MRCA are by definition also <b>common</b> <b>ancestors,</b> {{we can continue to}} find (less recent) <b>common</b> <b>ancestors</b> by pushing further back in time to find more and more ancestors who are the {{ancestors of}} all people alive today. Eventually we will reach a point in the past where all humans can be divided into two groups: those who have no descendants today and those who are <b>common</b> <b>ancestors</b> of all living humans today. This point in time is termed the identical ancestors point. Even though each living person receives genes in dramatically different proportions from these ancestors from the identical ancestors point, all living people share exactly the same set of ancestors from this point back, {{all the way to the}} very first single-celled organism.|$|R
5|$|Nielsen {{views the}} brachiopods and closely related phoronids as {{affiliated}} with the deuterostome pterobranchs because their lophophores are driven by one cilium per cell, while those of bryozoans, which he regards as protosomes, have multiple cilia per cell.
