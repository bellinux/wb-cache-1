40|$|When Jimmy Carter became {{president}} in January 1977, {{he took office}} with the stated objective of making both US {{domestic and foreign policy}} more humane and morale. The ambitious foreign policy objectives would be reached through addressing global issues such as human rights, economic development in third world countries, environmental problems and reduction of world-wide transfers of conventional weapons. During the presidential campaign and his first year in office, Carter committed himself to trying to reduce the world’s arms trade. This policy was planned to be realized through unilateral measures and multilateral negotiations, and by rationalizing the Executive Branch’s arms transfer decision-making process. The Administration worked out a <b>conventional</b> <b>arms</b> <b>transfer</b> restraint policy presented in May 1977 as Presidential Directive 13 (PD- 13). PD- 13 set out six unilateral control mechanism designed to reduce American sales of military material. The restrictions applied for all weapon importing states except NATO members, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. The thesis focuses on two main questions: a) to what extent was the arms transfer restraint policy followed up in practice; and b) if it was not fully implemented, why? Carter hoped that unilateral restraint combined with multilateral negotiations and comprehensive agreements would result in other weapon producing states following USA’s lead. Because the arms transfer restraint policy was planned based upon both unilateral measures and multilateral negotiations, the thesis looks at both aspects of the subject. How they affected each other, and to what extent the unilateral arms control measures rested upon success in negotiating multilateral restraint regimes. The only major arms supplier the Carter Administration managed to involve in serious discussions on the topic was the Soviet Union. The <b>Conventional</b> <b>Arms</b> <b>Transfer</b> Talks between the two superpowers lasted from December 1977 to December 1978, when they broke down without producing any agreements. These talks were not only important in themselves, but were also consequential because the West European weapon producers had based their willingness on participating in multilateral agreements upon Soviet seriousness in reducing their weapon sales. Because the Administration’s efforts at engaging other arms producing countries in arms transfer reductions were unavailing, and were abandoned in late- 1978, {{the focus is on the}} implementation on the unilateral policy. In eight case studies, the thesis examines the Carter Administration’s arms transfer policy toward Egypt, Iran, Israel, North Yemen, Pakistan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, South Korea, Taiwan and the whole of Latin America. U. S. arms transfer policy to these countries and regions during the Carter Presidency are discussed in relation to how they corresponded to the policy spelled out in PD- 13, and how they differed in respect to previous presidents’ policies...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} the Russian Federation's <b>conventional</b> <b>arms</b> <b>transfers</b> {{since the collapse}} of the Soviet Union in 1991. Russia looks to the sale of <b>conventional</b> <b>arms</b> as a promising source of capital income and a viable method to maintain its state defense industry. Due to a substantial decrease in sales volume, the international <b>conventional</b> <b>arms</b> market has become extremely competitive over the last decade. This competitiveness has driven exporters, including Russia, to offer latest technologies employed in such advanced weapons as supersonic anti-ship cruise missiles, acoustically quiet submarines, and fourth generation fighter aircraft. The continued worldwide proliferation of advanced Russian <b>conventional</b> <b>arms</b> will remain a major concern for the United States Navy in the foreseeable future. Navies throughout the world, in particular China's People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), are aggressively purchasing Russian advanced naval equipment and related technologies to improve their maritime capabilities. The United States Navy, accordingly, will increasingly encounter and possibly be engaged by advanced Russian <b>conventional</b> <b>arms</b> within the decade. Initiatives which curtail proliferation and minimize the impact of these weapons on regional stability should be implemented, thereby, reducing the potential threat to forward-deployed naval forces. The United States needs to strengthen current policies including the Wassenaar Arrangement arms control agreement, continue U. S. -Russian cooperative efforts in converting Russia's defense industry, and maintain a viable naval presence in the Western Pacific to counter the PLAN's modernization program.

Transfers of sophisticated weaponry to developing countries have several consequences, one of which is the dependence of a recipient upon its suppliers. Dependence is defined as a structural situation characterized by a concentration of linkages in the absence of alternatives. In a dependent <b>arms</b> <b>transfer</b> relationship, the recipient relies upon single or predominant suppliers. Dependence in <b>arms</b> <b>transfers</b> has led some developing countries to adopt one or both of two strategies to counter their foreign arms-transfer dependence. The first strategy is to diversify arms sources from largely single to multiple sources. The second strategy is to develop domestic defense industries. This study assesses the results of those counter-dependence strategies as implemented by the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) [...] Brunei, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. Four major questions are explored: (1) Does <b>arms</b> <b>transfer</b> dependence actually exist between ASEAN countries and their arms suppliers? (2) To what extent have ASEAN nations implemented strategies to diversify arms sources and achieved self-reliance? (3) What are the results of those counter-dependence strategies? and (4) Has the structure of <b>arms</b> <b>transfer</b> dependence between ASEAN states and their supplying nations changed?In this research, a comparative case study of the <b>arms</b> <b>transfer</b> structure of six individual ASEAN nations was conducted. The Herfindahl Index was employed to assess the concentration of linkages and determine changes in transfer structure for those countries from 1951 to 1990. Weapons production capacity and capability were assessed with Robert Harkavy's production capacity ranking and Andy Lee Ross's <b>Conventional</b> <b>Arms</b> Production Coefficients. The data indicate that <b>arms</b> <b>transfer</b> dependence exists between each of the six ASEAN members and their arms suppliers. Some degree of supply diversification occurred in every ASEAN nation but the attempts to alter their concentrated arms supply structures have not led to any sustained reductions in <b>arms</b> <b>transfer</b> dependence.

Five independent hypotheses have been formulated using explanations for <b>arms</b> <b>transfers</b> drawn from the academic theoretical literature on international relations as well as policy and popular interpretations. The dissertation tested all five hypotheses for their respective explanatory power in understanding United States <b>arms</b> <b>transfers</b> to the Middle East during a key thirty-year period, using a mix of techniques including a comprehensive overview of each factor, historical and objective grounding for each factor and a systematic inquiry using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The five individual hypotheses focus on Soviet <b>arms</b> <b>transfers</b> to the region, the regional balance of power, the "Israeli factor," the Arab-Israeli peace process and the "Oil factor". Data was collected to test each of these hypotheses. The results include the following: a modest action-reaction pattern in superpower <b>arms</b> <b>transfer</b> to the region does exist, with more support for a US reactionary policy to the Soviet Union than the opposite; US <b>transferred</b> <b>arms</b> to the hegemon's challengers to maintain {{a balance of power}} system in the Middle East; US <b>arms</b> <b>transfers</b> to Arab states were not strongly related as leads to US <b>arms</b> <b>transfers</b> to Israel; it was found that US peace attempts are moderately correlated with US <b>arms</b> <b>transfers</b> to the involved states; and, finally US <b>arms</b> <b>transfers</b> were strongly correlated with the oil factor.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine how {{domestic}} considerations affect the conduct of foreign policy of the United States. Taking the role of Congress in <b>arms</b> <b>transfer</b> to the Middle East as a case in point, the study identifies the major actors in the <b>arms</b> <b>transfer</b> policymaking process, examines the dynamic and fluid relationship between those actors, explores how Congress voted on <b>arms</b> <b>transfer</b> to moderate Arab countries, and also addresses the question of why members of congress voted the way they did on this issue. ^ In <b>arms</b> <b>transfer,</b> there are many more actors that get involved in the policymaking process than the three institutional actors [...] executive, legislative, judicial [...] mentioned in the United States constitution. <b>Arms</b> <b>transfer</b> involves companies that make the <b>arms</b> to be <b>transferred,</b> and ethnic groups who have emotional ties to their countries of origin requesting the arms. Except for the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, Congress has not been an initiator in arms-transfer policymaking; its role has been confined to fine-tuning <b>arms</b> <b>transfers</b> rather than blocking, vetoing them. The executive branch is still in control of <b>arms</b> <b>transfer</b> policymaking. ^ There are at least three types of <b>arms</b> <b>transfer</b> policy. The first is structural, in which arms deals are made on a routinely noncontroversial basis with cooperation between foreign countries buying the products, arms manufacturers, executive agencies concerned with <b>arms</b> <b>transfer,</b> and congressional committees foreseeing those transfers. The second type, emerges when a crisis on the international stage affects the national interests. The third type of <b>arms</b> <b>transfer</b> policy is strategic, and comes into play when a sale is controversial. ^ The House and Senate have behaved differently on exporting arms to Arab countries. The House has been more opposed to such arms sales than the Senate. Congressional Middle East <b>arms</b> <b>transfer</b> policy can be seen as a continuum. At one end are liberal Jewish House members; the other end are conservative non-Jewish Republican senators. (Abstract shortened with permission of author.) ...|$|R

Part one presents <b>arms</b> <b>transfers</b> data for deliveries and orders for France since 1956 based on open French governmental sources. Part two contrasts these findings with ACDA figures. ACDA would appear to substantially underestimate French transfers in constant and current dollars. From 1966 to 1975, these amount, respectively, to $ 1750 million and $ 5003 million. Part three outlines some of the principal implications of the two sets of conflicting data for estimating French <b>arms</b> <b>transfers.</b> In contrast to ACDA findings, French economic dependency on <b>arms</b> <b>transfers</b> is considerable and increasing. Until this dependence can be decreased and associated strategic and domestic political restraints relaxed, there exists little French interest in the immediate future in international efforts, such as those of the Carter administration, to diminish the magnitude, rate, or level of sophistication of <b>arms</b> <b>transfers</b> and technological know-how.
