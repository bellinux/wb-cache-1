For example, he found that water absorbs carbon dioxide far better than it absorbs nitrogen.

5|$|Lissitzky, {{aware of}} severe {{mismatch}} between his {{ideas and the}} existing urban landscape, experimented with different <b>configurations</b> <b>of</b> the horizontal surface and height-to-width ratios so that the structure appeared balanced visually ("spatial balance is in the contrast of vertical and horizontal tensions"). The raised platform was shaped {{in a way that}} each of its four facets looked distinctly different. Each tower faced the Kremlin with the same facet, providing a pointing arrow to pedestrians on the streets. All eight buildings were planned identically, so Lissitzky proposed color-coding them for easier orientation.|$|E

The <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> control logic that is associated with the changed <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> system is retrieved, if the changed <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> system is stored for the system. The control logic is adjusted to the changed <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> the system. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a computer program with a program code for executing a method for adjusting a control logic of a system. USE - Method for adjusting a control logic of a system e. g. materials handling equipment, transportation system, vehicle, or support system for elderly/disabled persons. ADVANTAGE - The method allows retrieval <b>of</b> the <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> control logic that is associated with the changed <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> system, if the changed <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> system is stored for the system, and adjusts the control logic to the changed <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> the system, thus enabling adding, removal or change of a unit of the system in a simple manner...|$|R

5|$|A {{shot line}} is a rope between a float at the surface, and a {{sufficiently}} heavy weight holding the rope approximately vertical. The shot line float should be sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of all divers {{that are likely to}} be using it at the same time. As divers are seldom weighted to be very negatively buoyant, a positive buoyancy of 50kg is considered adequate by some authorities for general commercial use. Recreational divers are free to choose lesser buoyancy ay their own risk. The shot weight should be sufficient to prevent a diver from lifting it from the bottom by over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or dry suit, but not sufficient to sink the float if the slack on the {{line is a}}ll taken up. Various <b>configurations</b> <b>of</b> shot line are used to control the amount of slack.|$|E

An advantage of the language is its readability by a human, but its similarity with natural languages introduces {{a certain level of}} ambiguity.

5|$|Copernicium {{should be}} a very heavy metal with a density of around 23.7g/cm3 in the solid state; in comparison, the most dense known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from copernicium's high atomic weight, the {{lanthanide}} and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough copernicium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. However, some calculations predict copernicium to be a gas at room temperature, the first gaseous metal in the periodic table (the second being flerovium), due to the closed-shell electron <b>configurations</b> <b>of</b> copernicium and flerovium. The atomic radius of copernicium {{is expected to be}} around 147pm. Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Cn+ and Cn2+ ions are predicted to give up 6d electrons instead of 7s electrons, which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues.|$|E

5|$|Later mathematicians {{introduced}} algebraic methods, which {{transform a}} geometric problem into algebraic equations. These methods were simplified by exploiting symmetries {{inherent in the}} problem of Apollonius: for instance solution circles generically occur in pairs, with one solution enclosing the given circles that the other excludes (Figure 2). Joseph Diaz Gergonne used this symmetry to provide an elegant straightedge and compass solution, while other mathematicians used geometrical transformations such as reflection in a circle to simplify {{the configuration of the}} given circles. These developments provide a geometrical setting for algebraic methods (using Lie sphere geometry) and a classification of solutions according to 33 essentially different <b>configurations</b> <b>of</b> the given circles.|$|E
40|$|To a pair (X,f), X compact ANR and f a {{continuous}} angle valued map defined on X, a fixed field and a nonnegative integer one assigns a finite <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> complex numbers with multiplicities {{located in the}} punctured complex plane and a finite <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> free modules over the ring of Laurent polynomials (with coefficients in the fixed field) indexed by the same complex numbers. This is done in analogy with the <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> eigenvalues and of generalized eigenspaces of an invertible linear operator in a finite dimensional complex vector space. The <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> complex numbers refines the Novikov - Betti number and the <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> free modules refines the Novikov homology associated with the cohomology class defined by f, {{in the same way}} the collection of eigenvalues and of generalized eigen-spaces refine the dimension of the vector space and the vector space on which the operator acts. In the case the field is the field of complex numbers the <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> free modules induces by "von-Neumann completion" a <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> mutually orthogonal closed Hilbert submodules of the L 2 [...] homology of the infinite cyclic cover of X determined by the map f, which is an Hilbert module over the von-Neumann algebra of complex L-infinity functions on the unit circle in the complex plane.

At Caltech Bacher attended lectures by Robert Oppenheimer, but spent most of his time at the Mt. Wilson Observatory, which had a better library. Bacher decided to create a work listing the energy, coupling constant, parity and electron <b>configurations</b> <b>of</b> all the known atoms and ions, working with Goudsmit back in Ann Arbor.
