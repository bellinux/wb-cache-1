25|$|I'd <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> kind of {{elaborate}} storyline, and {{the record}} was gonna be a concept record that {{had a number of}} pretentious elements to it. I was gonna talk about multi-layered reality and waking up in a dream you can't wake up out of, and eventually finding acceptance after you go through this period of trying to fight it. It was all kind of a big analogy for me getting sober.|$|E
25|$|Hawker was not {{the only}} one to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> basic concept; around the same time, the US Navy and Air Force both began similar {{programs}} for similar reasons, ultimately combining their efforts in the AIM-95 Agile project. Taildog and Agile differed primarily in range; Taildog was intended as a short-range dogfighting weapon, while Agile was a replacement for the Sidewinder and set range requirements at least as good as that missile, producing a much larger design.|$|E
25|$|United Airlines Flight 232: a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 {{flying from}} Denver to Chicago in 1989. The {{failure of the}} rear General Electric CF6-6 engine caused the loss of all {{hydraulics}} forcing the pilots to attempt a landing using differential thrust. 111 fatalities. Prior to the United 232 crash, {{the probability of a}} simultaneous failure of all three hydraulic systems was considered as high as a billion-to-one. However, the statistical models used to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> figure did not account {{for the fact that the}} number-two engine was mounted at the tail close to all the hydraulic lines, nor the possibility that an engine failure would release many fragments in many directions. Since then, more modern aircraft engine designs have focused on keeping shrapnel from penetrating the cowling or ductwork, and have increasingly utilized high-strength composite materials to achieve the required penetration resistance while keeping the weight low.|$|E

500|$|... "I {{tried to}} put {{different}} things in the video {{that made me feel}} under pressure and it really did! It was the hardest video I`ve ever done so I kept thinking, why on earth did I <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> concept? People don’t realise but I definitely have that Australian tomboy side to me. I love snakes and sharks and jumping out of planes and stuff. Growing up {{it never occurred to me}} that it wasn’t a girly thing to ride a bike, covered in mud holding frogs and collecting lizards!".|$|E
500|$|... "Immortality" [...] {{was written}} by co-executive {{producer}} David Wilcox and story editor Ethan Gross, and was directed by frequent Fringe collaborator Brad Anderson. Around the time the episode aired, executive producer and showrunner J.H. Wyman said of Anderson, [...] "If we <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> great concept and say, 'That's going to be tricky to shoot,' we know he's going to transcend it because he just has that {{way of looking at}} film as a feature director where anything's possible." [...] Wyman and fellow executive producer and showrunner Jeff Pinkner planned the Fauxlivia pregnancy storyline since they conceived her character; according to them, they departed from the typical television pregnancy trope by [...] "Fringe-if it" [...] and adding a science fiction element.|$|E

500|$|The {{water well}} {{sequence}} was critically acclaimed by critics. Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly described {{the scene as}} [...] "hilarious", and added, [...] "I loved the horrific pointlessness of that entire plot, and it was yet more proof that makeup designer Greg Nicotero is the real star of [...] I'm not sure anything else TV can <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> season will match {{the image of the}} bloated half-zombie crawling across the ground with its water-logged intestine hanging out." [...] Jackson, Rawlings, and the Houston Chronicle Pamela Mitchell felt that the sequence was one of the series' most grotesque moments. Rawlings added: [...] "Honestly, that right there is why many people watch The Walking Dead." [...] Wigler expressed that it was [...] "very well done", and noted that the walker was the [...] "most vile, disgusting zombie that Greg Nicotero has ever created." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1825 France sent an armada to Haiti and {{threatened}} to blockade the country, preventing trade unless Boyer agreed to pay [...] France 150,000,000 francs to reimburse it for losses of [...] "property"—mostly its slaves. [...] In exchange, France would recognize Haiti as an independent nation, which it had so far refused to do. [...] Boyer agreed without making the decision public beforehand, a move which met with widespread outrage in Haiti. [...] The amount was reduced to 90,000,000 francs in 1838, equivalent to USD $19 billion in 2015. Haiti was saddled with this debt until 1947, and forced to forgo spending on humanitarian programs such as sanitation. [...] In 1838, an estimated 30% of the country's yearly budget went to debt, and in 1900, the amount had risen to 80%. [...] Haiti took out loans from Germany, the US, and France itself to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> money, further increasing its debt burden and those countries' centrality in the Haitian economy.|$|E
500|$|Film critic Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars and called it [...] "a {{wonderful}} film." [...] The Hollywood Reporter lauded the film as [...] "Winsome, touching and arguably the funniest Pixar effort ever, this gorgeously rendered, high-flying adventure is a tidy 90-minute distillation of all the signature touches that came before it." [...] Although the San Francisco Chronicle noted that the film [...] "contains many boring stretches of mindless freneticism and bland character interaction," [...] it also declared that there are scenes in Up of [...] "such beauty, economy and poetic wisdom that they belong in any anthology of great movie moments...to watch Up with any attention is to be moved and astonished by the economy with which specific visuals are invested with emotion throughout ..." [...] Variety enthused that [...] "Up is an exceptionally refined picture; unlike so many animated films, it's not all about sensory bombardment and volume...Unsurprisingly, no one puts a foot wrong here. Vocal performances...exude a warm enthusiasm, and tech specifications could not be better. Michel Giacchino's full-bodied, traditional score is superlative..." [...] The Globe and Mail stated that Up is [...] "the kind of movie that leaves you asking 'How do people <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> stuff?'" [...] along with an overall positive review on the film, despite it being predictable.|$|E
50|$|Boozer <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> sciurine {{language}} by speculating what sapients without {{vocal cords}} would sound like, and decided they would sound like chipmunks then explored whether one {{could make a}} language composed entirely of unvoiced sounds.|$|R

2500|$|Other {{researchers}} also took notice. Charles Ashbacher, co-editor of the Journal of Recreational Mathematics, {{speaks of the}} field of magic squares being [...] "dramatically expanded" [...] Peter Cameron, winner of the London Mathematical Society's Whitehead Prize and joint winner of the Euler Medal, called geomagic squares [...] "a wonderful new piece of recreational maths, which will delight non-mathematicians and give mathematicians food for thought." [...] Mathematics writer Alex Bellos said, [...] "To <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> after thousands of years of study of magic squares is pretty amazing." [...] It may be asked whether geomagic squares might have applications outside the study of puzzles. Cameron is convinced of it, saying, [...] "I can immediately see a lot of things I'd like to do with this." ...|$|E
2500|$|Phillips and Mătăsăreanu, {{driving a}} white 1987 Chevrolet Celebrity, {{arrived at the}} Bank of America branch office at the {{intersection}} of Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Archwood Street in North Hollywood around 9:17 am, and set their watch alarms for eight minutes, the police response time they had estimated. To <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> timeframe, Phillips had used a radio scanner to monitor police transmissions prior to the robbery. As the two were walking in, they were spotted by two LAPD officers, Loren Farrell and Martin Perello, who were driving down Laurel Canyon in a patrol car. Officer Perello issued a call on the radio, [...] "15-A-43, requesting assistance, we have a possible 211 in progress at the Bank of America." [...] 211 is the code for robbery.|$|E
2500|$|As the sonnet {{is coming}} to an end, the poet expresses his devotion. He {{explains}} how he is done trying to find new affections. Radley and Redding explain that the [...] "no end" [...] he speaks of is his undying devotion. He no longer wants to go through these trials. He explains how he is done trying to find new affections. He realizes {{over the course of his}} quest that he ends up back to the young man, which is where he originally began on his quest. The use of [...] "on newer proof" [...] is used as a description of the poet's trials he went through to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> conclusion of full devotion. He continues to express to the young man that he is [...] "confined" [...] to him, promising him to never stray away from the young man when temptations arise. The use of the word confine suggests that the poet is fully devoted to the young man. He is only [...] "limited" [...] to the young man.|$|E

It was the Yankees' first fish, too, so they were in great spirits about it, and towed it to their ship, singing [...] "Yankee-doodle" [...] with all their might.|$|E
60|$|Wilhelmina {{comes out}} very strong, {{in this season}} of trouble; almost the last we see of our {{excellent}} Wilhelmina. Like a lioness; like a shrill mother when her children are in peril. A noble sisterly affection is in Wilhelmina; shrill Pythian vehemence trying the impossible. That a Brother, and such a Brother, the most heroic now breathing, brave and true, and the soul of honor in all things, should have the whole world rise round him, like a delirious Sorcerer's-Sabbath, intent to hurl the mountains on him,--seems such a horror and a madness to Wilhelmina. Like the brood-hen flying {{in the face of}} wild dogs, and packs of hounds in full trail! Most Christian Pompadour Kings, enraged Czarinas, implacable Empress-Queens; a whole world in armed delirium rushes on, regardless of Wilhelmina. Never mind, my noble one; your Brother will perhaps manage to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> leviathan or that among the heap of them, at a good time, and smite into the fifth rib of him. Your Brother does not the least shape towards giving in; thank the Heavens, he will stand to himself at least; his own poor strength will all be on his own side.|$|E

50|$|Wonder Woman editor/writer/penciler Mike Sekowsky once {{stated that}} he fully {{intended}} for these characters {{to be perceived as}} disturbingly kinky homosexual women.

60|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the same}} walk, on the same bright summer day, {{at the corner of the}} next little town or village, you may find another kind of tramp, {{embodied}} in the persons of a most exemplary couple whose only improvidence appears to have been, that they spent the last of their little All on soap. They are a man and woman, spotless to behold--John Anderson, with the frost on his short smock-frock instead of his 'pow,' attended by Mrs. Anderson. John is over-ostentatious of the frost upon his raiment, and wears a curious and, you would say, an almost unnecessary demonstration of girdle of white linen wound about his waist--a girdle, snowy as Mrs. Anderson's apron. This cleanliness was the expiring effort of the respectable couple, and nothing then remained to Mr. Anderson but to get chalked upon his spade in snow-white copy-book characters, HUNGRY! and to sit down here. Yes; one thing more remained to Mr. Anderson--his character; Monarchs could not deprive him of his hard-earned character. Accordingly, as you <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> spectacle of virtue in distress, Mrs. Anderson rises, and with a decent curtsey presents for your consideration a certificate from a Doctor of Divinity, the reverend the Vicar of Upper Dodgington, who informs his Christian friends and all whom it may concern that the bearers, John Anderson and lawful wife, are persons to whom you cannot be too liberal. This benevolent pastor omitted no work of his hands to fit the good couple out, for with half an eye you can recognise his autograph on the spade.|$|E
