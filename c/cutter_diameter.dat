The report starts with a short introduction to cutter wear and the factors influencing on it. Before presenting acalculation of the effects the difference <b>cutter</b> <b>diameters</b> theoretical will have on advance rate and cutter life. The calculations suggest an advance rate of a 10 meter diameter TBM with 17 ” cutters being 77. 3 % of the rate of aTBM with 19 ” cutters. The 20 ” cutters will have an advance rate of 91. 3 % of the 19 ” cutter machine. The cutter lifein hours is calculated to be 13 % lower for a machine with 17 ” cutters than a machine with 19 ”. The effect of using 20 ” cutter rings is calculated to extend the cutter life in hours with 16 %. The field work on the thesis is done on two 10 m diameter double shield TBMs boring in India, the AMR 1 projectand the Veligonda Project. Both machines are utilizing 19 ” with 20 ” cutter rings. The geological conditions arevarying for both projects. The field testing and the lab testing is done according to the NTNU model and includes net penetration tests andchip analysis. The processing and calculations are done according to the NTNU-model. The AMR 1 project has had an average penetration rate of 1. 62 m/h and a cutter life of 1. 25 h/c, or 2. 02 m/h. TheVeligonda project has an average penetration rate slightly higher 1. 90 m/h. The cutter life has been significantly higher with 12. 75 h/c in the first period at the project. On the second period it was a change in the geology and thecutter life was reduced to 1. 90 h/c. The utilization rates for the projects have been generally low with an averagemachine utilization of around 30 %. When comparing the results to comparable projects it gives the following indications: - The advance rate is significantly improved when using large <b>cutter</b> <b>diameters.</b> - The 20 ” cutter rings have a beneficial effect on weekly advance rates in hard and abrasive rock. - The 20 ” cutter rings gives a slight economic saving in hard and abrasive rock compared to 19 ” cutter rings. The estimation of the AMR project from NTNU and Robbins has some major differences. This has been looked at indetail and it gives an indication of a systematically overestimation in advance rate and cutter life for the Robbinsestimates. This leads to an underestimation of the cutter costs of the AMR 1 project. The biggest differences in theestimates are at the AMR 2 where the boring still has not started.  </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Optimization of {{machining}} {{parameters for}} improving the machining efficiency is become important, when high capital cost NC machines have been employed for high precision and efficient machining. The strategy is to minimize the production time and cost by optimizing feed per tooth, speed, width of cut, depth of cut and tool diameter by satisfying all the constraints such as maximum machine power, maximum cutting force, maximum machining speed, feed rate, tool life and required surface roughness. The optimal End milling <b>cutter</b> <b>diameter</b> and radial depth of cut (step over) are also the key issues for minimization of total production cost. Therefore, in this paper an attempt {{has been made to}} include all major parameters such as feed per tooth, speed, width of cut (Step-over) and depth of cut along with diameter of tool for minimising the time and production cost during 2. 5 D milling. Hence, a mathematical model has been developed and Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been proposed to solve the problem. Optimal values of machining parameters have been calculated for benchmark problems and compared with handbook recommendations. It has been found that approximately 13 % of production cost can be reduced by choosing optimal <b>cutter</b> <b>diameter</b> and width of cut. Besides this 50 % reduction in cost per unit volume and 61 % increment in material removal rate has also been reported by selecting optimal cutting parameters over the handbook recommendations...|$|E

After mobilizing the mucoperiosteal flap, the 3 -mm center punch was used to register a guide for the twist drill. The twist drill was used to establish the axial alignment of the implant and {{to assist in the}} guidance of the depth drill. The depth drills were sequentially used to create osteotomy to the subcrestal axial depth of 0.5  mm. The conical reamer was used to develop the conical shape of the implant body and to check the osteotomy depth. A counter-clockwise rotation was used to compress the bone in soft bone. The tap or thread cutter was used for dense bone to create the threads in the osteotomy. The thread <b>cutter’s</b> <b>diameter</b> corresponds to the implant diameter. To engage the implant into the implant placement tool, the square faces on the implant fixture mount were aligned with those on the implant placement tool, then pushed together. Using the handle (finger wheel), the implant was pulled out of inner vial and the plastic collar was discarded. The implant placement assembly was transferred to the osteotomy and the implant was secured into the osteotomy site. The implant placement was started with the handle and finally placed using the hand-ratchet. If excessive force was experienced, the osteotomy was rinsed out and the depth was checked by retapping. To disengage fixture mount from implant, the open-ended spanner was used to break the retention force of the fixture mount retention screw. The knurled top of the implant placement tool was turned by hand to fully disengage the fixture mount with the implant. Pushing down on the knurled top of the implant placement tool disengaged the fixture mount.|$|R

40|$|Fluid film {{bearings}} are {{a possible}} solution {{to be adopted}} in very high speed applications if the operating speeds overcome the maximum rotational speeds of rolling bearings. In particular, gas bearings offer important advantages thanks to the low viscosity of air and to the peculiarity of being non-contact systems. For these properties they are characterized by low friction, high accuracy and life almost unlimited. In machine tools, gas bearings are adopted in applications that usually are limited to electrospindles of small dimensions (like e. g. high speed grinding, milling, PCB drilling and coatings). For this reason in this paper the applicability of gas bearings for a larger electrospindle for machining process is investigated. The spindle, of 50 mm diameter, is accelerated by an asynchronous motor of nominal speed 75 krpm and power 2. 5 kW. A test bench was designed and realized to perform static and dynamic characteristics of the spindle and to allow the measurement of the cutting loads during machining. The experimental characterization of the electrospindle is shown. In particular, the static stiffness of gas bearings and the air consumption were measured at different supply pressures.

The applications extend to many fields that demand high-level tolerances from microproducts and component functional and structural integrity. Silicon-based products are limited because silicon is brittle. Products {{can be made from}} other engineering materials and need to be machined in microscale. This research deals with predicting microtool failure by studying spindle runout and tool deflection effects on the tool, and by measuring the cutting force that would fail the tool during microend-milling.

Finite element analysis (FEA) predicts tool failure due to static bending for a deflection greater than 99 % of tool diameter. Threshold values of chipload and cutting force resulting in tool failure were found using workdone by tool.

This study was carried out to determine the planing properties of naturally grown Melunak (Pentace sp.), Dark Red Meranti (Shorea sp.) and Rubberwood (Hevea brasiliensis). Some machining defects such as fuzzy grain, torn grain and chip marks often occur in lumbers at the planing process and it decreases the machining yield.

The experimental tests served to quantify single scaling effects like e. g. milling <b>cutter</b> <b>diameter</b> and the feed per tooth. To enhance {{the understanding of the}} process the effects were emulated numerically with finite element simulations. In all experiments an intense impact of the specific WCu material properties on the machining process {{and the quality of the}} process output was detectable. The tests concerning the tool displacement showed that an enlargement of the feed per tooth causes a significant increase of the tool displacement and also that a smaller mass fraction of tungsten promotes a smaller tool displacement, however at the cost of higher data scattering. A high tungsten mass fraction impedes the chip formation and leads to intense tool deformations due to the hardness of tungsten. The preliminary quasistatic chipping tests validated that a lower tungsten mass fraction leads to decreasing cutting forces. The increasing cutting forces coming along with smaller tungsten particle size correlated with milling experiment executed previously but were only detected with WCu 60 / 40 so far. The SEM pictures show clear differences between the WCu specifications and support the high impact of the WCu material characteristics. A thermographic test setup was developed to obtain knowledge about the temperatures at the tip of the cutting edge of a milling tool. The tests pointed out that the temperature rises during the engagement time whereas most of the cooling happens in the first quarter of the idle time. Since the previous 3 D model used for FEM simulations did not provide a constant element size in the model for different WCu specifications a new fully parameterized geometry preprocessor was programmed.

40|$|Milling is {{a process}} of {{producing}} flat and complex shapes with the use of multi-tooth cutting tool, which is called a milling cutter and the cutting edges are called teeth. The axis of rotation of the cutting tool is perpendicular to the direction of feed, either parallel or perpendicular to the machined surface. The machine tool that traditionally performs this operation is a milling machine. Milling is an interrupted cutting operation: the teeth of the milling cutter enter and exit the work during each revolution. This interrupted cutting action subjects the teeth to a cycle of impact force and thermal shock on every rotation. The tool material and cutter geometry must be designed to withstand these conditions. Cutting fluids are essential for most milling operations. In this Paper the design aspects of milling cutter is analyzed. The objective considered is the design and modeling of milling cutter and to analyse various stress components acting on it. Various designing strategies are considered to design the effective milling <b>cutter</b> like outer <b>diameter,</b> inner diameter, radius, teeth angle etc. The design and analysis is carried out using the softwares like CATIA V 5 and ANSYS...|$|R
