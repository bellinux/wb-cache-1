40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to examine the}} demand for <b>cross</b> <b>directional</b> control of basis weight on a board machine. To analyse the demand, changes made by the control system are studied. The {{significant}} changes were expected to be present when a major event occurred on the machine. The events classified as major were changes in basis weight, of grade or of coating blade. Break of board and stoppage of the machine were also included. These events can be seen as large disturbances to the machine. In order to identify the disturbances a methodology had to be developed. The methodology developed is to analyse the output from a model with the actuators of the control system as input and measurement of basis weight as output. The analysis of this output was done using the multivariate method of principal component analysis. The data analysed in this thesis was collected on-line from a board machine operating within the Stora Enso group. Over a period of 3 months, a total of 47 sets of data were collected, each set representing 12 - 14 hours. The data analysis shows that the variations in the control system are greater than the variation in the measured basis weight. This is a strong indication that the control system is needed and in order to find disturbances in the <b>cross</b> <b>directional</b> profile it is not enough only to analyse the final product, the control signals also have to be analysed. The large disturbances do not necessarily emerge from the major events as assumed. Other causes might havelarger impact to the process then first believed. One of the major obstacles in trying to explain the variations is that the basis weight is controlled by using the centre layer of the board but measured on the final product. This leads {{to the fact that the}} errors seen by the measuring system can result from anything on the machine and be compensated by basis weight in the centre layer of the board...|$|E
40|$|In {{relation}} to the time-scale of chemical kinetics, diffusive transport in micro-devices is faster than in conventional mixers. To exploit the resulting potential for chemical process engineering, size effects evident in the transport processes have to be understood. For this purpose, the scaling behaviour concerning the transport of mass, momentum and heat are considered. Just as much, the mixing behaviour of flow mixers on micro-scales needs to be further investigated. Therefore, based on numerical simulations, the mixing characteristic of a T-shaped micro-reactor with rectangular cross sections is studied for three different flow regimes. For {{the description of the}} mixing quality, Dankwerts ’ intensity of mixing is complemented by a measure of the scale of segregation which employs the concept of specific contact area.

This paper describes an application of Bayesian methods {{in the search for}} statistically significant temporal segmentations in the data collected by a <b>cross</b> <b>directional</b> (CD) control system in an industrial web forming process. CD control systems give rise to vector observations which are often transformed through orthogonal bases for control and performance analysis. In this paper two models which exploit basis function representations of vector times series data are segmented. The first of these is a power spectrum model based on the asymptotic Chi-squared approximation which allows large data sets to be processed. The second approach, more capable of detecting small changes, but as a result is more computationally demanding, is a special case of the multivariate linear model. Given the statistical model of the data, inference regarding the number and location of the change-points is based on numerical Bayesian methods known as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The methods are applied to real data and the resulting segmentation relates to real process events. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd...|$|E

Special attention was paid to the difference in the ratio of strain-at-break values between machine and cross direction of paper and paperboard. Scientific principles were used to design the creping pattern. Various techniques were used to analyze the physical and mechanical properties of the creped substrates. In order to analyze the creped samples, microscopic analysis was performed to find the cracks in the substrates. Likewise, tensile strength, bending stiffness, tear strength and grease barrier experiments were performed. Thickness and density were reported in the initial phase of the thesis project.

To {{reduce the incidence of}} material failure, the toughness of the apertured elastic trilaminate body paneling material needs to be improved without reducing the elasticity, breathability, and material cost. A “tougher” material was defined as a material with greater tensile strength and puncture resistance than standard, commercial product. The design team took a two-pronged approach to this problem. First, experiments were designed to quantify the effects of altering the die temperature, the resin blend, the <b>cross</b> <b>directional</b> stretch activation depth, and production line speed on toughness. A 2 -level, full factorial analysis revealed that the process variables that had the largest effect were activation depth and die temperature. While altering the resin blend improved toughness, the trilaminate elasticity suffered. Decreasing both activation depth and die temperature resulted in a 19. 7 % greater puncture resistance than the original material, which was able to withstand 17. 5 % greater tensile load. However, only a minimal increase in its elongation at break, 5. 7 %, was achieved. Decreasing only activation depth provided a better balance of the desired characteristics: an 11. 5 % increase in puncture resistance, 16. 1 % increase in tensile load, and 14. 6 % increase in elongation.

Manufacturer data relating to the CLT material properties varies how the <b>cross</b> <b>directional</b> laminas are considered. Finally it was found that there is limited published knowledge regarding CLT material properties for panels loaded non-tangentially to the direction of the timber grain. A method for predicting failure loads and modes has been presented and compared with experimental test data. A Strut and Tie model is proposed for the analysis of CLT panels, a methodology originally developed to design of reinforced concrete deep beams. The Strut and Tie approach considers panel geometry, loads, supports, different properties in tension and compression and was adapted to consider anisotropic behaviour. The procedure, advantages and limitations have been presented and a model developed for an application in CLT. The use of this model is considered for the analysis of simple CLT panel loadings. The behaviour of CLT at different timber grain angles demonstrate a complex composite behaviour influencing the strut and tie capacities. The definition of node sizes was also found to be critical to the definitions of the struts and ties and hence the capacity of the sections. Comparison of experimental tests to the model demonstrates some application to using a Strut and Tie in CLT panels.

The search pattern should be designed to fit the motion vector probability (MVP) distribution characteristics of the real-world sequences. In this paper, we build a directional model of MVP distribution to describe the directional-center-biased characteristic of the MVP distribution and the directional characteristics of the conditional MVP distribution more exactly based on the detailed statistical data of motion vectors of eighteen popular sequences. Three directional search patterns are firstly designed by utilizing the directional characteristics and they are the smallest search patterns among the popular ones. A new algorithm is proposed using the horizontal cross search pattern as the initial step and the horizontal/vertical diamond search pattern as the subsequent step for the fast BMME, which is called the <b>directional</b> <b>cross</b> diamond search (DCDS) algorithm. The DCDS algorithm can obtain the motion vector with fewer search points than CDS, DS or HEXBS while maintaining the similar or even better search quality.

One of key problems in development of LEDs is successful thermal management during illumination. Therefore, current research ongoing related to high power LEDs {{is focusing on}} improvementof cooling performance of them to enhance light output efficiency, durability and reliability of these devices. The goal of current studyis a first characterization of the LEDs arrays cooling with microchanneled flows. The flow and heat transfer characterization of a 5 LED array on top of water driven microchannels are performed and the junction temperature change with flow rate and thermal resistance isstudied. Experimental {{results show that the}} microchannel cooler reduces the junction temperature of LED array and improves the heat dissipation capability of the LEDs themselves. X At very low Reynolds numbers, there are discrepancies found between literature data and ourexperimental results. These discrepancies are explained by uncertainty in general measurements at microscale, including geometrical dimensions and operating parameters. It is demonstrated that the uncertainty in f*Re is dominated by the microchannel width and height measurements. Even a very accurate pressure drop measurements are oftenovershadowed by the geometry measurement uncertainties. In addition,the channel geometry is often not exactly the desired geometry dueto manufacturing difficulties associated withsmall scales. Therefore, the flow behavior is different from the expectations based on theory. Nusselt number variation with Reynolds number is investigated. Nusselt number is almost linearly increasing with Reynolds number inthe low Reynolds number range as also observed in literature. In fact, Nusselt number is expected to be constant in fully developed laminarflow according to the classical laminar flow theory.

30|$|To {{realize the}} MWF, an {{estimate}} of the second-order statistics (SOS) of the noise signals is required. Based on the assumption of a diffuse noise field, several methods are derived for estimating the SOS of the noise components in terms of the auto-power spectral density (PSD) [13 – 15] or the cross PSDs between all channels for both the target source(s) and the noise and interference components [16]. Furthermore, it was recently proposed to exploit the direct-to-diffuse ratio (DDR) to realize the MWF for stationary noise and babble noise conditions [17]. It was also suggested to exploit the position information to estimate the <b>cross</b> PSDs of <b>directional</b> speech interferences [18]. For unsupervised algorithms, prior spatial information such as information about the source positions or the sensor constellation is often incorporated to improve the robustness. Model-based multichannel approaches [6, 7] can incorporate the directional information by initialization of a part of the spatial model. Parra and Alvino [19] proposed to combine an ICA algorithm with geometric constraints in order to improve the separation performance, where BSS was regarded as a set of beamformers whose response is constrained to a set of DoAs for recovering all sources from the mixture. Inspired by [19], Directional BSS [20] was proposed to serve as a blocking matrix (BM) when using a different constraint for the opposite purpose: this constraint forces essentially a spatial null towards a certain direction in order to suppress the target source and to preserve the interfering and noise components. The precondition not only for Directional BSS but also for Parra’s method is that the DoA information on the target source(s) must be given. Furthermore, based on the noise estimate produced by Directional BSS, a two-unit source extraction/noise reduction scheme combining a BM and a noise reduction unit was proposed in [21], where the spectral weights in the noise reduction stage are designed based on a diffuse noise field assumption. In this paper, we focus on the discussion of Directional BSS operating as a BM.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies on}} tone-vowel {{interaction}} have centered on two issues. The {{first is the}} correlation between tone and vowel quality (Pilszczikowa-Chodak 1972, 1975, Newman 1975 for Hausa; Cheung 1973 for Omei dialect of Mandarin; Wang 1968, Maddieson 1976, Yip 1980, Chan 1985 for Fuzhou), {{and the second is}} the directionality of the influence between tone and vowel, namely, whether tone affects vowel quality change, or whether vowel quality gives rise to tonal change (Wang 1968, Maddieson 1976, Yip 1980 for Fuzhou; Gandour 1977 for Thai dialects; Yue 1976 for Cantonese, Lianzhou, and Taishan). There {{have been a number of}} experimental studies on the first issue. The principal finding among these studies is the correlation between fundamental frequency (F₀) and vowel height. In particular, a high vowel has higher F₀ and a low vowel has lower F₀ (Lehiste and Peterson 1961 for English; Petersen 1976 for Danish; Di Cristo and Chafcouloff 1976 for French; Kim 1968 for Korean; Chuang and Wang 1976, Tsay and Sawusch 1994 for Mandarin; and Sawusch and Tsay 1994 for Fuzhou; etc.). Since tone, defined as linguistic use of pitch, is also primarily identified in terms of F₀ (Gandour 1978), it is natural to ask whether this phonetic correlation between F 0 and vowel height manifests itself phonologically in natural languages. In other words, the question is whether there is any empirical evidence suggesting a phonological correlation between tone and vowel height. The evidence for Hausa (an African language principally spoken in Nigeria), for example, is inconclusive. Data is offered both for (Pilszczikowa-Chodak 1972, 1975) and against (Newman 1975) this position. A highly controversial case is Fuzhou, (a Northern Min dialect spoken on the southern coast of China). In Fuzhou, a whole series of finals participate in vowel alternations in accordance with their tonal environment. It has been claimed, on the one hand, that in a tone sandhi environment, a vowel undergoes raising when the tone it occurs with increases its F₀ (Wang 1968). This is characterized as a tone -induced vowel raising process (Yip 1980). I refer to this claim as the "height-correlation" hypothesis. On the other hand, it has been argued that the vowel alternations in Fuzhou involve not only differences in height, but also differences along other dimensions, such as a front/back axis, monophthongs versus diphthongs, etc. (Maddieson 1976, Chan 1985). The "height- correlation" hypothesis, therefore, is not sufficient to explain all instances of tone -related vowel alternation. The implicit assumption behind this debate is that tonal features and vocalic features may interact directly. This yields a more fundamental question as to the nature of this interaction. In other words, whether the interaction between tone and vowels is direct (i. e. feature -to- feature) or indirect (i. e. mediated by something else). Although studies of the second issue are relatively rare, it has been shown that the influence of tones and vowels on each other is bi- <b>directional</b> <b>cross</b> -linguistically. For example, whereas Mandarin and Fuzhou have been cited as cases in which vowel alternations are conditioned by tonal environment (Wang 1969, Wang 1968, Yip 1980), the Yue dialects of Chinese, such as Cantonese, Taishan, and Lianzhou, illustrate the opposite direction of influence (Yue 1976). In Cantonese, for instance, the Yin "entering" tone historically splits into two tones according to their vocalic environment. It is realized with a higher register when the vowel is lax and short, and with a lower register when the vowel is tense and long (Yue 1976 : 49). A general question that relates to the first issue, then, is whether tone and vowel quality directly influence each other or whether this influence between them is mediated by something else. This article provides a unified account for all vowel distribution and alternation patterns corresponding to tonal environments in Fuzhou, focusing on the prosodic anchor mediating between tones and vowels. Tones and vowels will be claimed not to interact directly (i. e., feature -tofeature), and it will be seen that there is no height correlation between them. Instead, tone -vowel interaction in Fuzhou must be mediated by a prosodic anchor; in this case, the mora; and distinct moraic structures (monomoraic/bimoraic) required by the prelinking of the lexically specified number of tonal roots are what trigger the vowel alternations. The analysis is formulated within the constraint -based grammar of Optimality Theory (OT) (McCarthy and Prince 1993 a, b; Prince and Smolensky 1993; Pulleyblank 1994, among others). Contrary to the rule -based approach, OT assumes that Universal Grammar (UG) contains two types of phonological representation: the input and the output. The function Gen freely generates a set of output candidates for each input. UG also contains a set of violable constraints that are ranked on a language- particular basis. The function Eval determines the optimal output, which either satisfies the higher ranked constraints, or has the least violations of the relevant constraints...|$|R
