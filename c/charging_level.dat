A charge classifier was used to measure the <b>charge</b> <b>level</b> of the aerosol as a function of particle diameter.

40|$|AbstractA {{stratified}} single tank is {{an alternative}} to a two-tank storage system for solar thermal power plants since it is promising cost reductions and shows more potential for further technical development. Direct integration of the steam generator {{is one of the}} possibilities. In this paper a higher order finite volume modeling approach for the storage is presented which reduces numerical diffusion but applies a turbulence factor which determines stratification. The discharge of the storage and the circulation of molten salt through the shell side of the internal steam generator by a forced flow is compared to natural circulation. The buoyancy driven flow strongly depends on the system design. The performance is improved with higher positioning of the heat sink in the storage system since a lower minimum <b>charging</b> <b>level</b> of the storage is required to obtain the design flow rate. The difference between the operation modes is more distinctive in the morning and the evening, when the <b>charging</b> <b>level</b> is relatively low and during days with low irradiation. With the chosen configuration both operation modes lead to the same circulation rate as soon as the <b>charging</b> <b>level</b> exceeds 24 %. An annual simulation showed a reduction of total produced electricity by 3 % for natural circulation compared to forced circulation. In case of forced circulation 95 % of the cumulated charging power can be discharged, pure natural circulation achieves a discharge rate of 91 %. To achieve the same performance the buoyancy driven flow needs to be supported by an impeller in 9 % of the operational time...|$|E

40|$|When {{cells are}} {{subjected}} to nutritional stress, uncharged tRNAs accumulate and activate Gcn 2 p phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor- 2 (eIF 2) and the general amino acid control pathway. The Gcn 2 p regulatory domain homologous to histidyl-tRNA synthetases is proposed to bind to uncharged tRNA, directly contributing to activation of Gcn 2 p. Here we apply a microarray technology to analyze genome-wide changes in tRNA charging in yeast upon activation of Gcn 2 p in response to amino acid starvation and high salinity, a stress not directly linked to nutritional deficiency. This microarray technology is applicable for all eukaryotic cells. Strains were starved for histidine, leucine, or tryptophan and shown to rapidly induce Gcn 2 p phosphorylation of eIF 2. The relative <b>charging</b> <b>level</b> of all tRNAs was measured before and after starvation, and Gcn 2 p activation and the intracellular levels of the starved amino acid correlate with the observed decrease in tRNA charging. Interestingly, in some cases, tRNAs not charged with the starved amino acid became deacylated more rapidly than tRNAs charged with the starved amino acid. This increase in uncharged tRNA levels occurred although the intracellular levels for these non-starved amino acids remained unchanged. Additionally, treatment of a wild-type strain with high salinity stress showed transient changes in the charging of several different tRNAs. These results suggest that Gcn 2 p can be activated by many different tRNA species in the cell. These results also depict a complex cellular relationship between tRNA charging, amino acid availability, and non-nutrient stress. These relationships are best revealed by simultaneous monitoring of the <b>charging</b> <b>level</b> of all tRNAs...|$|E

40|$|During {{last few}} decades {{research}} on Automotive Air Conditioning System (AACS) reached a milestone in terms of comfort, safety and economy. However investigation on system performance due to AACS’s variable operating conditions is limited. The performance of any AACS mostly depends on compressor speed, blower speed, refrigerant <b>charge</b> <b>level</b> and ambient condition. However, the combined effect of these parameters {{on the performance of}} AACS could be non-intuitive. Reduction in compressor speed and blower speed reduces the cooling capacity. Again, higher blower speed induces large volume of fresh air inside the cabin, which requires more compression work to maintain the same comfort level. Further the best performance of the system is achieved at an optimum <b>charge</b> <b>level</b> which is not independent of the other operating conditions. Therefore, it is essential to assess the performance of AACS for a wide combination of operating variables so that the range of optimum operating zone can be identified. With this purpose, an off board test bench has been developed for evaluating the performance of an automotive air conditioning system. The facility consists of the mechanical hardware used in an automobile along with a large number of additional sensors and a standalone control system that mimics the operations in a car. The experiments were carried out with varying compressor and blower speed along with a variable refrigerant charge for a given ambient condition. Total sixty set of experiments were conducted at 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 g of refrigerant <b>charge</b> <b>level.</b> In each <b>charge</b> <b>level</b> the speed of the compressor was fixed at 1000, 1300, 1600 and 1900 rpm by using a variable frequency drive. Again in each compressor speed, the blower speed of the evaporator was selected at three different set points. The cooling capacity, compression work and COP of the system are reported in this paper over this wide operating range. It is observed that with the increase in compressor speed, cooling capacity and compression work increases along with a decrease in the COP of the system. The results indicate that the AACS could operate over a wide range of <b>charge</b> <b>levels,</b> 15 % below to 15 % above the design value without any significant impact on its performance. Beyond this range, the performance of the system was found to be strongly dependent upon the <b>charge</b> <b>level.</b> The degree of superheat at the evaporator outlet and degree of subcooling at the condenser outlet were shown to be significantly dependent on the <b>level</b> of refrigerant <b>charge.</b> Though the system performance depends on the speed of both the compressor and the blower, the effect of the latter on the refrigeration cycle is only marginal. The optimum operating condition with compressor and blower speed along with refrigerant <b>charge</b> <b>level</b> has also been identified...|$|R

40|$|Major {{changes in}} {{planning}} paradigms {{have taken place}} in power systems in recent years because of deregulation of the power industry, environmental policy changes, advancements in technology, and the transformation of the grid to intelligent systems, referred to as the smart grid. These changes will continue to drive the distribution systems planning function to evolve in the coming years. It is therefore important to develop effective planning strategies to identify the qualities, capabilities, and attributes that are necessary for the future distribution grid. Demand response (DR), distributed generation (DG), energy storage systems (ESS), and plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) are expected {{to be a part of}} the solution of these distribution system planning challenges. However, very little of the present research on distribution system planning have considered these options simultaneously. Moreover, traditional planning options such as substation expansion, new feeder connections and capacitor placements should also be simultaneously considered. Such a coordinated planning can help evaluate the alternatives to provide maximum benefits to the network owner and customers. With the increase in gas prices driven by a foreseeable fossil fuel depletion in the future, development in the automotive sector, and environmental concerns, penetration of PEVs has been increasing in recent times. The charging load of PEVs will definitely impact the distribution grid. To mitigate these effects, the local distribution companies (LDCs) need to adopt the right actions and policies, and develop associated infrastructure. In the current context of smart grids, the LDCs need to control PEV charging demand while also considering customer preferences, which can lead to benefits such as deferment of the decisions on reinforcement and other investments, and maximize the use of existing infrastructure. In addition, LDCs need to establish rate structures that incentivize the use of smart charging and increase the adoption and use of PEVs, which can benefit both the LDCs and the customer. This research focuses on developing models to investigate and address the problem of distribution system planning in the presence of PEV charging loads. First, a comprehensive long-term distribution planning framework from the perspective of LDCs is proposed considering DG, substations, capacitors, and feeders. Apart from considering the usual demand profile, the proposed framework considers uncontrolled and controlled (smart) PEV charging demand, as well as DR options. Based on a back-propagation algorithm combined with cost-benefit analysis, a novel approach is proposed to determine the optimal upgrade plan, allocation, and sizing of the selected components in distribution systems, to minimize the total capital and operating cost. A new iterative method is proposed which involves post-processing the plan decisions to guarantee acceptable adequacy levels for each year of the planning horizon. Second, a generic and novel framework is proposed to assess the Distribution System Loading Margin (DSLM) to accommodate uncontrolled and smart PEV charging loads without the need for any additional investments or upgrades in the distribution system. The model determines what percentage of the fleet can be served by uncontrolled charging and smart charging, respectively. Monte Carlo simulation has been carried out to simulate the uncertainty of demand, drivers' behaviour, market share of PEV class, and <b>charging</b> <b>level.</b> The maximum allowable penetration of uncontrolled and smart charging loads are determined based on the current available market data pertaining to PEV type and <b>charging</b> <b>level,</b> considering different charging scenarios. Finally, a PEV smart charging approach is proposed where the charging loads are incentivized by the LDC for every unit of energy controlled. A novel framework is proposed to determine the optimal participation of PEVs in the smart charging program and optimal incentives paid by the LDC to PEV customers, such that both parties are economically benefited. The proposed framework models the relationship between customers' participation and incentives offered by the LDC. The relationship between the expected investment deferral and hence the economic benefits from smart charging participation are considered as well. Monte Carlo simulation is carried out to simulate the uncertainty of demand, electricity market price, drivers' behaviour, PEV market share, and <b>charging</b> <b>level...</b>|$|E
