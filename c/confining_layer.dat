25|$|In unconsolidated aquifers, {{groundwater}} {{is produced}} from pore spaces between particles of gravel, sand, and silt. If the aquifer is confined by low-permeability layers, the reduced water {{pressure in the}} sand and gravel causes slow drainage of water from the adjoining confining layers. If these confining layers are composed of compressible silt or clay, the loss of water to the aquifer reduces the water pressure in the <b>confining</b> <b>layer,</b> causing it to compress from the weight of overlying geologic materials. In severe cases, this compression can be observed on the ground surface as subsidence. Unfortunately, much of the subsidence from groundwater extraction is permanent (elastic rebound is small). Thus, the subsidence is not only permanent, but the compressed aquifer has a permanently reduced capacity to hold water.|$|E
25|$|If the {{distinction}} between confined and unconfined is not clear geologically (i.e., {{if it is not}} known if a clear <b>confining</b> <b>layer</b> exists, or if the geology is more complex, e.g., a fractured bedrock aquifer), the value of storativity returned from an aquifer test can be used to determine it (although aquifer tests in unconfined aquifers should be interpreted differently than confined ones). Confined aquifers have very low storativity values (much less than 0.01, and as little as 10−5), which means that the aquifer is storing water using the mechanisms of aquifer matrix expansion and the compressibility of water, which typically are both quite small quantities. Unconfined aquifers have storativities (typically then called specific yield) greater than 0.01 (1% of bulk volume); they release water from storage by the mechanism of actually draining the pores of the aquifer, releasing relatively large amounts of water (up to the drainable porosity of the aquifer material, or the minimum volumetric water content).|$|E

At low QD-CL mismatch {{there is a clear}} evidence of spillover of the exciton wave-function due to small localisation energies. This is suppressed as the In content, x, in the CLs decreases (mismatch and localisation energy increasing). The combined effects of low effective mass and wave-function spillover at high x result in a diamagnetic shift coefficient that is an order of magnitude larger than for samples where In content in the barrier is low (mismatch is high and localisation energy is large). Finally, an anomalously small measured Bohr radius in samples with the highest x is attributed to a combination of thermalisation due to low localisation energy, and its enhancement with magnetic field, a mechanism which results in small dots in the ensemble dominating the measured Bohr radius...|$|R

50|$|The {{water of}} the GAB is held in a {{sandstone}} layer laid down by continental erosion of higher ground during the Triassic, Jurassic, and early Cretaceous periods.

50|$|Groundwater {{extraction}} {{can also}} lead to well contamination by causing upwelling, or upcoming, of saltwater from the depths of the aquifer. Under baseline conditions, a saltwater wedge extends inland, underneath the freshwater because of its higher density. Water supply wells located over or near the saltwater wedge can draw the saltwater upward, creating a saltwater cone that might reach and contaminate the well. Some aquifers are predisposed towards this type of intrusion, such as the Lower Floridan aquifer: though a relatively impermeable rock or clay layer separates fresh groundwater from saltwater, isolated cracks breach the <b>confining</b> <b>layer,</b> promoting upward movement of saltwater. Pumping of groundwater strengthens this effect by lowering the water table, reducing the downward push of freshwater.|$|E

50|$|Surface {{contamination}} of wells in the United States is typically {{controlled by the}} use of a surface seal.

The well is typically cased from the surface down into the smaller hole with a casing that is the same diameter as that hole. The annular space between the large bore hole and the smaller casing is filled with bentonite clay, concrete, or other sealant material. This creates an impermeable seal from the surface to the next <b>confining</b> <b>layer</b> that keeps contaminants from traveling down the outer sidewalls of the casing or borehole and into the aquifer.

30|$|The {{structures}} {{with different}} In contents in the <b>confining</b> <b>layers</b> demonstrated similar dependencies at equivalent spectral ranges. So, the band-to-band excitation in GaAs (1.5  eV) shows a quadratic dependence {{at most of}} intensity values. This is typical for the band-to-band recombination of non-equilibrium charge carriers, for instance when they are highly predominant under the equilibrium carriers [53]: this is expectable in our undoped structures. The dependencies {{in the case of}} excitation in the QD and InGaAs <b>confining</b> <b>layers</b> are very similar to each other but different from those for GaAs. They are linear at low excitation intensities and become sublinear at higher intensities. This behavior obviously points out to the carrier recombination involving Shockley-Read centers: the linear dependence becomes sublinear one, as some of the centers are saturated at higher carrier generation rates [54]. These results of intensity-dependent measurements distinctly indicate an efficient generation of main charge carriers at a relatively low recombination rate in QD embedding layers and a much higher density of recombination centers in GaAs layers. For example, during the QD excitation in similar characterizations, InGaAs/GaAs QD photosensitive structures showed a dependence from intensity as PC(I)[*]~[*]I 0.25, which occurred due to a high rate of the non-radiative recombination though defect levels along with QD radiative recombination [40, 55]. However, it is worth to notice that the InGaAs/GaAs structure was multilayered having seven QD layers.|$|R

40|$|The {{response}} of borehole water levels to barometric pressure changes in semiconfined aquifers {{can be used}} to determine barometric response functions from which aquifer and <b>confining</b> <b>layer</b> properties can be obtained. Following earlier work on barometric response functions and aquifer confinement, we explore the barometric response function as a tool to improve the assessment of groundwater vulnerability in semiconfined aquifers, illustrated through records from two contrasting boreholes in the semiconfined Chalk Aquifer, East Yorkshire, UK. After removal of recharge and Earth tide influences on the water level signal, barometric response functions were estimated and aquifer and <b>confining</b> <b>layer</b> properties determined through an analytical model of borehole water level response to barometric pressure. A link between the thickness and vertical diffusivity of the <b>confining</b> <b>layer</b> determined from the barometric response function, and groundwater vulnerability is proposed. The amplitude spectrum for barometric pressure and instrument resolution favor determination of the barometric response function at frequencies to which <b>confining</b> <b>layer</b> diffusivities are most sensitive. Numerical modeling indicates that while the high frequency response reflects <b>confining</b> <b>layer</b> properties in the immediate vicinity of the borehole, the low frequency response reflects vertical, high diffusivity pathways though the <b>confining</b> <b>layer</b> some hundreds of meters distant. A characteristic time scale parameter, based on vertical diffusivities and thicknesses of the saturated and unsaturated <b>confining</b> <b>layer,</b> is introduced as a measure of semiconfined aquifer vulnerability.

For atomically smooth mica surfaces, the following sequence of transitions 1 → 1 _b → 2 B → 2 → 2 are observed in the one- and two-layered regimes, where n, n, and nB denote triangular, square, and buckled phases, respectively, with the prefix n denoting the number of <b>confined</b> <b>layers.</b> The presence of potassium on mica is seen to have a strong influence on the degree of order induced in the fluid. The sequence of solid-solid transitions that occurs with the smooth mica surface is no longer observed. When equilibrated with a state point near the liquid-solid transition, a counterintuitive freezing scenario is observed in the presence of potassium. Potassium disrupts in-plane ordering in the fluid in contact with the mica surface, and freezing is observed only in the inner <b>confined</b> <b>layers.</b> The largest mica separations at which frozen phases were observed ranged from separations that could accommodate six to seven fluid layers.

Solutions are found for flows corresponding to various different faulting and background flow scenarios for a <b>confined</b> inclined porous <b>layer.</b> The speed of advance {{and shape of the}} injected fluid front are calculated. It is found that different boundary conditions associated with different faulting scenarios can lead to very different spatial distributions of CO 2. Investigation is made into how a <b>confined</b> <b>layer</b> may begin to fill with injected fluid when the injected current approaches a fault. The different solutions for different faulting scenarios can indicate radically contrasting injection strategies. Some possible consequences of a mixing reaction in a porous layer are also addressed. The understanding gained from the solutions found may help in the interpretation of remote geophysical observations and so contribute to the assessment of safety and the optimisation of injection strategies for carbon dioxide sequestration scenarios.
