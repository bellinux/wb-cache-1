40|$|A DNA probe, pCS 20, {{previously}} described {{for use in}} detection of <b>Cowdria</b> <b>ruminantium</b> <b>infections</b> in Amblyomma variegatum (the principal vector of heartwater) hybridized with C. ruminantium DNA in organs of laboratory-infected A. hebraeum adult ticks (the major southern African vector of heartwater). The probe hybridized with C. ruminantium DNA in 46 / 49 midguts from male ticks and 26 / 29 from females, thus indicating infection. Corresponding salivary glands were less heavily infected, but infections were more numerous in glands from males. Infection in ticks was confirmed by transmission of the disease to susceptible goats. The probe did not hybridize with DNA from uninfected ticks or with DNA from a spotted fever group rickettsia commonly associated with A. hebraeum in Zimbabwe.

Cowdria-infected populations consisted of 48 sheep and 44 goats, while the noninfected populations consisted of 64 sheep and 107 goats. Cutoff values were determined by two-graph receiver-operating characteristic (TG-ROC) curves. The cutoff value was set at 31 and 26. 6 % of the positive control reference samples for sheep and goat sera, respectively. The test’s diagnostic performance was evaluated with measurements of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of the ROC curves and by the valid range proportion (VRP). The AUCs were 0. 978 for sheep sera and 0. 989 for goat sera. The VRP for both sheep and goat sera was approximately 1. 0. The intermediate range (IR), which defines results that are neither positive nor negative, was 0 for goat sera and 2. 81 for sheep sera. In an ideal test, the AUC and VRP would be 1. 0 and the IR would be 0. In this study these parameters were close to those of an ideal test.

40|$|The bont tick, Amblyomma hebraeum, is the {{principal}} vector to southern African ruminants of heartwater (<b>Cowdria</b> <b>ruminantium</b> <b>infection).</b> The role of feeding male ticks, which emit an aggregation-attachment pheromone, in attracting unfed ticks to cattle was investigated. Calves infested with feeding male ticks were more attractive to unfed adult ticks than were uninfested calves. The presence of the pheromone on previously infested cattle apparently allows unfed ticks to discriminate between hosts on which these parasites have fed successfully (suitable hosts) and those on which they have not (potentially unsuitable hosts). The use of acaricides is thus unlikely to reduce bont tick populations in areas where adequate numbers of alternate (wild) hosts are present. Also, cattle so treated may lose their resistance to heartwater through lessened exposure to infected ticks...|$|E

40|$|Disease {{attributable}} to Ehrlichia ruminantium (for-merly <b>Cowdria</b> <b>ruminantium)</b> <b>infection</b> was first de-scribed in South Africa in 1838 as a nervous condition of sheep that developed after a substantial infestation of ticks. 1 It is an infectious but noncontagious tick-borne disease (ie, heartwater) that affects domestic and wild ruminants. Infection often causes {{the death of}} clinically affected ruminants. In 2009, many sub-Saharan African countries and the island of Guadeloupe in the Carib-bean reported clinical cases of heartwater in their do-mestic ruminant populations. 2 Additionally, livestock have died of heartwater on the islands of Marie-Galante and Antigua in the Caribbean. 3 On {{the basis of the}} proximity of the United States mainland to the Caribbean islands, the ultimate concern for animal health officials, members of the livestock in-dustry, and other stakeholders may not be what should be done to keep heartwater from being introduced into the continental United States, but rather {{what can be done to}} limit the extent of an outbreak when this in-cursion transpires. A key element to controlling the extent of a disease outbreak is early recognition of the disease in an animal population. Therefore, the pur-pose of the information reported here is to describe the salient features of heartwater and to promote increased disease awareness among veterinarians, livestock own-ers, wildlife biologists, and other stakeholders.

40|$|A {{serological}} {{survey in}} Mozambique to detect antibodies to <b>Cowdria</b> <b>ruminantium,</b> the etiologic agent of heartwater, revealed a seroprevalence of 8. 1 % (n = 332) for goats {{in the northern}} province of Tete and of 65. 6 % (n = 326) for goats in the southern provinces. Translocation of 10 serologically negative goats from Tete to farms in the south resulted in two clinical cases of heartwater that were fatal. In addition, four goats seroconverted within the study period of 5 weeks. One goat showed no symptoms. Two goats died of other causes, whereas the remaining goat went missing after 1 week. Experimental needle infections of goats and sheep were conducted to confirm results and to isolate different strains of C. ruminantium.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{economic}} impact of heartwater (<b>Cowdria</b> <b>ruminantium</b> <b>infection)</b> and model the impact of improved vaccines against the disease, a field study was conducted to provide data on livestock productivity indicators in Zimbabwe. Cross-sectional studies were performed in the two main agro-ecological regions, lowveld and highveld, where heartwater was thought to be endemically stable and epidemic, respectively. These studies were designed to provide data on livestock productivity and profitability, and other key production indicators from the smallholder (SH) and large scale commercial (LSC) production systems, and from beef, dairy, sheep and goat enterprises. The results show that the profitability of LSC beef farms, as indicated by overall positive gross margins, was similar (p> 0. 05) irrespective of location and whether or not heartwater cases were reported. Only LSC dairies that reported heartwater cases demonstrated a negative gross margin, though this was not significantly different from dairy farms that did not report heartwater, or from the beef farms. The highveld and lowveld SH areas, which were both assumed to be endemically stable for heartwater, displayed positive gross margins, though the margin was significantly (p< 0. 001) higher in the highveld than in the lowveld. This study indicates that losses associated with heartwater are minimal under endemic stability and in epidemic areas where tick control is effectively implemented. Furthermore, the profitability of livestock production, in both the LSC and SH production sectors, could be increased if more cost effective methods of tick and tick-borne disease control (which {{is one of the major}} costs of production) are made available...|$|E
40|$|The tick vectors of {{heartwater}} (<b>Cowdria</b> <b>ruminantium</b> <b>infection)</b> in Zimbabwe, Amblyomma hebraeum and Amblyomma variegatum, historically {{were believed}} to be confined to the low-lying regions of the south and north-west of the country. However, country-wide surveys performed in 1975 - 1980 and 1988 - 1991 demonstrated that both species were also established in western parts of the highveld plateau and had started to encroach on the predominantly heartwater-free central and eastern highveld regions. To determine the current distributions of both the vectors and evaluate the potential threat of heartwater to animals in the highveld, a survey of ticks infesting cattle was performed in 1996 at 2994 locations in small-holder and large-scale commercial farming areas throughout Zimbabwe. Amblyomma hebraeum was collected at 1329 locations, a. variegatum at 72 locations and both A. hebraeum and A. variegatum at 13 locations. The results demonstrated that A. hebraeum was present as previously recorded, throughout the southern half of the country and appeared to have undergone further limited spread into the central and eastern highveld regions. Only the northern-most region of the country appeared to be free of this species. Amblyomma variegatum was collected mainly in the north-west, as previously recorded, but was also found at isolated locations across the central highveld region and along the eastern border with Mozambique. This species was, however, still absent from the southern half and the northern-most regions of the country. An overlap of the distributions of the two species existed within a zone along the southern and eastern regions of the distribution of A. variegatum. These results suggest that the vectors of heartwater are spreading and threaten to introduce heartwater into intensive livestock-producing regions of the country...|$|E
40|$|Currently {{available}} {{serological tests}} for cowdriosis (<b>Cowdria</b> <b>ruminantium</b> <b>infection)</b> in domestic ruminants are hampered by their low specificities because of cross-reactivity with Ehrlichia spp. The use of recombinant major antigenic protein (MAP 1) of C. ruminantium for serodiagnosis was investigated. Overlapping {{fragments of the}} MAP 1 protein were expressed in Escherichia coli and were reacted with sera from sheep infected with either C. ruminantium or Ehrlichia ovina. Two immunogenic regions on the MAP 1 protein, designated MAP 1 -A and MAP 1 -B, were identified. MAP 1 -A was reactive with C. ruminantium antisera, E. ovina antisera, and three MAP 1 -specific monoclonal antibodies, whereas MAP 1 -B reacted only with C. ruminantium antisera. An {{indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) based on MAP 1 -B was further developed and validated with sera from animals experimentally infected with C. ruminantium or several Ehrlichia spp. Antibodies raised in sheep, cattle, and goats against nine isolates of C. ruminantium reacted with MAP 1 -B. Cross-reactivity with MAP 1 -B was limited to Ehrlichia canis and Ehrlichia chaffeensis, two rickettsias which do not infect ruminants. Antibodies to Ehrlichia spp. which do infect ruminants (E. bovis, E. ovina, and E. phagocytophila) did not react with MAP 1 -B. Antibody titers to C. ruminantium in sera from experimentally infected cattle, goats, and sheep were detectable for 50 to 200 days postinfection. Further validation of the recombinant MAP 1 -B-based ELISA was done with sera obtained from sheep raised in heartwater-free areas in Zimbabwe and from several Caribbean islands.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that immunity of cattle to <b>Cowdria</b> <b>ruminantium</b> <b>infection</b> is mediated by T lymphocytes. C. ruminantium antigens that stimulate these responses are therefore of considerable {{importance to the}} development of a sub-unit vaccine against the disease. We have examined T cell responses against recombinant analogues of the surface-exposed C. ruminantium major antigen 1 (MAP 1) a 28. 8 kDa protein and MAP 2 (21 kDa) antigen in cattle immunised by infection and treatment. Vigorous and sustained proliferative responses to both antigens were observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from immune cattle. MAP 1 -specific responses were predominantly restricted to cluster of differentiation four antigen positive T cells (CD 4 + T cells). Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of cytokine expression by T cell lines derived from this population revealed strong expression of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), interferon alpha (IFN-alpha), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), tumour necrosis factor beta (TNF-beta), interleukin- 2 receptor alpha (IL- 2 Ralpha) transcripts, and weak expression of IL- 2 and IL- 4. Supernatants from these T cell cultures contained IFN-gamma protein. CD 4 + T cell clones specific for MAP 1 were generated. Two of these clones proliferated in the presence of autologous infected endothelial cells. In contrast, the response to MAP 2 was characterised largely by proliferation of gamma delta (gamma alpha) T cells. RT-PCR analysis of cytokine expression by T cell lines which were dominated by gamma T cells revealed expression of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, IL- 2 Ralpha transcripts. Supernatants of these T cell cultures also contained IFN-gamma protein.

40|$|Several {{conclusions}} {{of importance to}} studies on the epidemiology of heartwater were drawn from an investigation in which the numbers of adult Amblyomma hebraeum ticks, to which a closed herd of Hereford cattle were exposed {{over a period of}} 6 ½ years, were manipulated. With a tick <b>Cowdria</b> <b>ruminantium</b> <b>infection</b> rate of 3 - 5 %, an endemically stable situation was created by dipping the herd only when an average of 10 adult male and female A. hebraeum ticks were counted on 10 animals. When the average was increased to 15 during the calving period, 97 % of calves acquired a tick-mediated immunity at the age of 6 months. Because only adult ticks confined to the hindquarters are counted, this procedure is recommended as a feasible and practical guideline to stock owners wishing to determine a dipping programme that would ensure endemic stability. The indirect fluorescent antibody test gave a true reflection of the infection rate through ticks in calves 3 - 6 months old, but not in older animals that had been re-infected more than once. This is because on one hand antibody may persist for 2 years after withdrawal from tick exposure and on the other the artificial re-infection of cattle with a tick acquired immunity is not always followed by a rise in antibody titres and may even result in seronegativity. Four cows infected and re-infected through licks, remained immune to challenge for 2 years after withdrawal from tick exposure. Within the confines of one farm 3 isolates of C. ruminantium that differed in pathogenicity and immunogenicity were recovered from ticks. One of these isolates was almost non-pathogenic to cattle.

40|$|Serological {{diagnosis}} of heartwater or <b>Cowdria</b> <b>ruminantium</b> <b>infection</b> has been hampered by severe cross-reactions with antibody responses to related ehrlichial agents. A MAP 1 B indirect {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} that has an improved specificity and sensitivity for detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies has been developed to overcome this constraint (A. H. M. van Vliet, B. A. M. Van der Zeijst, E. Camus, S. M. Mahan, D. Martinez, and F. Jongejan, J. Clin. Microbiol. 33 : 2405 – 2410, 1995). When sera were tested from cattle in areas of endemic heartwater infection in Zimbabwe, only 33 % of the samples tested positive in this assay despite a high infection pressure (S. M. Mahan, S. M. Samu, T. F. Peter, and F. Jongejan, Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci 849 : 85 – 87, 1998). To determine underlying causes for this observation, the kinetics of MAP 1 B-specific IgG antibodies in cattle after tick-transmitted C. ruminantium infection and following recovery were investigated. Sera collected weekly over a period of 52 weeks from 37 cattle, which were naturally or experimentally infected with C. ruminantium via Amblyomma hebraeum ticks, were analyzed. MAP 1 B-specific IgG antibody responses developed with similar kinetics in both field- and laboratory-infected cattle. IgG levels peaked at 4 to 9 weeks after tick infestation and declined to baseline levels between 14 and 33 weeks, despite repeated exposure to infected ticks and the establishment of a carrier state as demonstrated by PCR and xenodiagnosis. Some of the serum samples from laboratory, and field-infected cattle were also analyzed by immunoblotting and an indirect fluorescent-antibody test (IFAT) to determine whether this observed seroreversion was specific to the MAP 1 B antigen. Reciprocal IFAT and immunoblot MAP 1 -specific antibody titres peaked at 5 to 9 weeks after tick infestation but also declined between 30 and 45 weeks. This suggests that MAP 1 B-specific IgG antibody responses and antibody responses to other C. ruminantium antigens are down regulated in cattle despite repeated exposure to C. ruminantium via ticks. Significantly, serological responses to the MAP 1 B antigen may not be a reliable indicator of C. ruminantium exposure in cattle in areas of endemic heartwater infection...|$|E

Cowdria-specific T-cell lines generated from vaccinated animals by in vitro restimulation with Cowdria lysates are 95 to 100 % CD 41, are MHC class II restricted, and produce gamma interferon. They proliferate in response to autologous monocytes infected with live Cowdria but not in response to uninfected monocytes. These T-cell lines will facilitate the search for Cowdria antigens that are immunogenic for T cells and will therefore be of relevance {{in the development of a}} subunit vaccine against the disease. <b>Cowdria</b> <b>ruminantium</b> is a tick-transmitted rickettsia that causes heartwater, or cowdriosis, an economically important disease of ruminants in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean islands (32). The available method for vaccination against heartwater consists of administration of live virulent organisms to animals followed by tetracycline treatment during the febrile reactio...|$|R
40|$|Heartwater, an {{infectious}} disease of ruminants {{caused by the}} rickettsia <b>Cowdria</b> <b>ruminantium</b> (transmitted by ixodid ticks of the genus Amblyomma and vertically), severely constrains livestock production throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Its epidemiology varies from epidemics with high mortality (on introduction into a previously unexposed population) through to endemic stability (very low morbidity when the vector density is high and host infection is common and occurs early in life). A new generation of inactivated vaccines for heartwater is being developed {{and there is an}} urgent need to investigate the impact of their use on transmission dynamics and livestock production economics as an aid in the design of cost-effective, integrated, control programmes. Without conducting long-term, expensive field trials, the only way of exploring these aspects is through predictive, quantitative models. A mathematical description of the trransmission dynamics of the tick-borne <b>infection</b> <b>Cowdria</b> <b>ruminantium</b> in commercial beef enterprises in Zimbabwe was used to consider the potential epidemiological impact of a candidate vaccine to prevent heartwater with the quantitative results employed in an economic analysis...|$|R
40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} (MAb) binding to <b>Cowdria</b> <b>ruminantium</b> elementary bodies (CB) {{were identified}} by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and surface binding of one MAb (446. 15) to intact CB was determined by immunofluorescence, immunogold labeling, and transmission electron microscopy. MAb 446. 15 bound an antigen of approximately 43 kDa in immunoblots of eight geographically distinct strains. The NIAb did not react with Ehrlichia canis antigens or uninfected bovine endothelial cell lysate and {{may be useful in}} diagnostic assays and vaccine development...|$|R
40|$|Endothelial {{cells are}} {{involved}} in important pathological situations. They could be the target for infectious processes as for example in Cowdriosis, an important disease in cattle due to the rickettsia <b>Cowdria</b> <b>ruminantium</b> prevalent {{in the south of}} the Sahara. They are also connected to angiogenic processes related to tumor invasion. Our results indicate that AIDS related Kaposi sarcoma cells may be of endothelial origin. We conclude from our data the mobility of those cells, related to the expression of the metalloproteinases (especially the 92 kD form of the enzyme), {{is an important factor in}} Kaposi saroma dissemination and is the main factor limiting the scale up of Cowdriosis vaccine production in Bovine Umbilical Endothelial Cell line. We showed that PMA and TNF increased the 92 kD Metallaproteinase and that TGFβ, produced in an inactive form in cultures of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells, is a potential inhibitor of Kaposi sarcoma spreading, and could also be useful in improving our process for <b>Cowdria</b> <b>ruminantium</b> vaccine production, since it reduces the sensitivity of the cells to mechanical stress without affecting significantly the overall infectious process.

40|$|This {{workshop}} proceeding {{discusses the}} importance of anaplasmosis, babesiosis and cowdriosis; the methods of control being used for the diseases and the problems encountered with these control methods; recent findings in the epidemiology and molecular biology of these diseases, and developments towards new vaccines. Topics of discussion include distribution, economic importance, control measures, diagnosis, approaches to new vaccines, and in vitro cultivation. Under the topic diagnosis, papers are presented on development of diagnostic reagents for anaplasmosis and babesiosis; serodiagnosis of <b>Cowdria</b> <b>ruminantium,</b> and DNA probes for this species. The papers under approaches to new vaccines examine molecular biology of rickettsiae with particular reference to gene organization and structure in Anaplasma marginale and Cowdria ruminantium; methodological approaches {{to the study of}} resistance in cowdriosis and the possible role of cell-mediated immunity; progress in development of subunit vaccines for anaplasmosis, development of an antigenically defined vaccine against Babesia bigemina; vaccination against Babesia bovis using antigens produced by recombinant DNA technology, and identification of Babesia divergens protective antigens. The last topic, in vitro cultivation, discusses cultivation of babesia, progress with the cultivation of <b>Cowdria</b> <b>ruminantium</b> in endothelial cells, and in vitro cultivation of Anaplasma marginale...|$|R
