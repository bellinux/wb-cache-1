However, he was visibly limping and seemed to rest near a drum riser while leaning over and holding his knee during the instrumental breaks of his hit songs. As he came offstage, a doctor from the University of South Carolina cut off Chesney’s cowboy boot and immediately began treating the foot injury. X-rays that were taken afterwards revealed several <b>crushed</b> <b>bones</b> in his right foot.|$|E
25|$|All Jews {{from the}} Judenfrei {{district}} of Wartheland were deported to Chełmno {{under the guise}} of 'resettlement'. At least 145,000 prisoners from the Łódź Ghetto perished at Chełmno in several waves of deportations lasting from 1942 to 1944. Additionally, 20,000 foreign Jews and 5,000 Roma were brought in from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia. All victims were killed with the use of mobile gas vans (Sonderwagen), which had exhaust pipes reconfigured and poisons added to gasoline (see Chełmno Trials for supplementary data). In the last phase of the camp's existence, the exhumed bodies were cremated in open-air for several weeks, during Sonderaktion 1005. The ashes, mixed with <b>crushed</b> <b>bones,</b> were trucked every night to the nearby river in sacks made from blankets, to remove the evidence of mass murder.|$|E
25|$|Chatterjee was {{convinced}} {{that some of these}} <b>crushed</b> <b>bones</b> belonged to two individuals– one old, one young– of the same species. However, only a few parts were found, primarily a skull and some limb bones which moreover do not well agree in their proportions respective to each other, and this has led many to believe that the Protoavis fossil is chimaeric, made up of more than one organism: the pieces of skull appear like those of a coelurosaur, while the femur and ankle bone catalogued under TTU P-9200 and TTU P-9201 respectively suggest affinities to non-tetanuran theropods and at least some vertebrae are most similar to those of Megalancosaurus, an avicephalan diapsid. However, those supposed similarities between the cervicals of Protoavis and drepanosaurids were the same similarities that Feduccia and Wild (1993) used to argue for an affinity between Archaeopteryx and drepanosaurids.|$|E

5000|$|Dinocrocuta is an extinct genus of hyena-like feliform carnivores. It {{lived in}} Asia, and Africa, during the Miocene epoch. It had very strong jaws that {{were able to}} <b>crush</b> <b>bones.</b> Its {{estimated}} weight was roughly 380 kg.|$|R
50|$|Jaws and teeth: Tyrannosaurus had {{powerful}} {{jaws and}} robust teeth.

2500|$|Each {{of the ten}} ossuaries {{contained}} human remains, {{said to be in}} an [...] "advanced {{state of}} deterioration" [...] by Amos Kloner. The tomb may have been multi-generational, with several generations of bones stored in each ossuary, but no record was kept of their contents and no analysis appears to have been done to determine how many individuals were represented by the bones found. In addition, three skulls were found {{on the floor of the}} tomb below the 0.5 metre fill layer, and <b>crushed</b> <b>bones</b> were found in the fill upon the arcosolia. The scattering of these bones below the fill indicated that the tomb had been disturbed in antiquity. All the bones were eventually turned over to religious authorities for burial.|$|E
2500|$|Since 5000 BC, the Egyptians made a tooth powder, which {{consisted}} of powdered ashes of ox hooves, myrrh, powdered and burnt eggshells, and pumice. The Greeks, and then the Romans, improved the recipes by adding abrasives such as <b>crushed</b> <b>bones</b> and oyster shells. In the 9th century, Iraqi musician and fashion designer Ziryab invented a type of toothpaste, which he popularized throughout Islamic Spain. The exact ingredients of this toothpaste are unknown, but it {{was reported to have}} been both [...] "functional and pleasant to taste". It is not known whether these early toothpastes were used alone, were to be rubbed onto the teeth with rags, or were to be used with early toothbrushes, such as neem-tree twigs and miswak. Toothpastes or powders came into general use in the 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|In 1845, it was {{alleged that}} paupers at the Andover Union workhouse {{employed}} in crushing bones were (regardless {{of age or}} state of decay) eating marrow from the bones and gnawing off any shreds of meat still adherent. [...] When reported to the guardians, they had neither intervened, nor informed the Poor Law Commissioners. [...] The Assistant Poor Law Commissioner for the area (a Mr Parker) was sent to investigate, and found the allegations to be largely true, if slightly over-stated. This {{had been going on}} for some time without being detected by the Poor Law Commission's supervisory regime (in the first instance Mr Parker). The Home Secretary had on a number of occasions told the House of Commons that grinding bone was work of too penal a nature to be carried out by workhouse inmates, and the Poor Law Commission would see that his wish that it should cease was acted upon. [...] The <b>crushed</b> <b>bones</b> were mostly sold to the guardians(for use as fertiliser) at a price which did not represent good value for the rate-payer.|$|E

He crossed no more hills or divides, but automatically followed a large stream which flowed through a wide and shallow valley. He did not see this stream nor this valley. He saw nothing save visions. Soul and body walked or crawled side by side, yet apart, so slender was the thread that bound them.|$|E
6000|$|Two {{recently}} published accounts of substances strewed {{on the surface}} of pasture-land, having become buried through the action of worms, may be here noticed. The Rev. H. C. Key had a ditch cut in a field, over which coal-ashes had been spread, as it was believed, eighteen years before; and on the clean-cut perpendicular sides of the ditch, at a depth of at least seven inches, there could be seen, for a length of 60 yards, [...] "a distinct, very even, narrow line of coal-ashes, mixed with small coal, perfectly parallel with the top-sward." [...] {45} This parallelism and the length of the section give interest to the case. Secondly, Mr. Dancer states {46} that <b>crushed</b> <b>bones</b> had been thickly strewed over a field; and [...] "some years afterwards" [...] these were found [...] "several inches below the surface, at a uniform depth." ...|$|E

All this time she was still seated, looking at him, leaning forward towards him with her hands upon her brow. 'But, Paul, I spit out my words to you, like any common woman, not because they will hurt you, but because I know I may take that comfort, such as it is, without hurting you. You are uneasy for a moment while you are here, and I have a cruel pleasure in thinking that you cannot answer me. But you will go from me to her, and then will you not be happy? When you are sitting with your arm round her waist, and when she is playing with your smiles, will the memory of my words interfere with your joy then? Ask yourself whether the prick will last longer than the moment. But where am I to go for happiness and joy? Can you understand what it is to have to live only on retrospects?' ...|$|E

50|$|A <b>bone</b> <b>crusher</b> is {{a device}} {{regularly}} used for <b>crushing</b> animal <b>bones.</b> Bones obtained during slaughter are cleaned, {{boiled in water}} and dried for several months.

25|$|Lythronax {{is known}} from some large teeth. It has been stated that these resembled banana-shaped meat cleavers, {{although}} somewhat smaller. Its teeth are serrated, but also quite beefy.

50|$|The {{species was}} not {{recorded}} in the wild after 1850, and was long considered to be extinct. Reasons suggested for its disappearance include changes in livestock management, {{and the loss of}} predatory megafauna; in either case, the scarcity of large carcasses with partly <b>crushed</b> <b>bones,</b> which would allow the insects to reach the medullary cavity and the bone marrow, denied the fly its likely breeding habitat.|$|E
50|$|The {{metallic}} salt or binder {{used are}} typically colourless or almost so. The organic {{component of the}} dye determines {{the color of the}} resulting precipitate.

Nor did the mighty beast even pause in his steady advance along the ledge.|$|R
50|$|Cattle in the United States {{are often}} fed chicken litter.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates this practice by attempting to prevent the introduction of any part of a cow's brain or spinal cord into livestock feed. Other countries, like Canada, have banned chicken litter for use as a livestock feed.|$|R
50|$|During {{the revolt}} of 14 October 1943, about 600 prisoners tried to escape; about half succeeded in {{crossing}} the fence, of whom around 50 evaded capture.
