While recent studies on laser welding of Al 5 xxx series and Al 6 xxx series alloys have examined weldability, the laser autogenous welding usually results in low gap bridging capability and weld defects such as porosity, underfill, cracking, and so on. In this study, we evaluated the gap bridging capability and the <b>crack</b> <b>sensitivity</b> during laser autogenous welding, laser welding with filler wire, and laser-arc hybrid welding, respectively. Al 5 J 32 and 6 K 21 sheets were used as the base metal and Al 4 xxx series and Al 5 xxx series wires were used as the filler metal. Employing adequate welding conditions, the gap bridging capability during butt welding was investigated for each welding process. To clarify the solidification <b>crack</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> bead-on-plate welding was implemented for a tapered specimen as a self-restraint crack test. Compared with the laser autogenous welding, laser welding with filler wire and the laser-arc hybrid welding showed improved gap bridging capability and reduced <b>crack</b> <b>sensitivity...</b>|$|E

By varying the nitrogen content of the gas atmosphere the structure and hence the hardness and cavitation erosion behaviour of the laser nitrided layers can be controlled in a wide range. The study revealed that the achieved increase of hardness and cavitation erosion resistance can be mainly attributed to solid solution hardening by nitrogen {{and not to the}} formation of titanium nitrides.

40|$|This {{study was}} devoted to the {{influence}} of phosphorus on reheat <b>cracking</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of Cr-Mo steels from the view points of the combined effect of phosphorus, chromium and molybdenum. The systhetic Cr-Mo steels melted in our laboratory were used. Their phosphorus contents were varied from 0. 004 to 0. 1 wt% for five sets of Cr-Mo contents. The <b>cracking</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of steels was evaluated by the term of critical restraint stress to produce cracking obtained by the modified implant method for reheat <b>cracking.</b> The <b>cracking</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was discussed being related to the phosphorus segregation to prior-austenite grain boundary. The phosphorus concentration of grain boundary was semi-quantitatively determined by measuring the depth of grain boundary etched by a certain etchant. The results are summarized as follows.

40|$|Forging {{tools are}} often showing short lifetimes {{compared}} to cold forming tools e. g. for sheet metal forming. This {{is based on}} the process conditions where high local surface temperatures are alternating with chilling conditions due to the spray cooling with water based cooling lubricants. The resulting thermal shock is provoking fatigue of the tool material in the near surface regions. Crack initiation and crack growth due to thermal shock exposure then causes chipping of the tool steel material in the surface regions. These are starting points for extensive wear. Hardness and wear resistance of tool surfaces at elevated temperatures can be dramatically enhanced with nitriding pretreatments. This has become state-of-the-art for hot forming tool steels in many forging applications. With inappropriate adjustments of the nitriding parameters a decrease of the ductility can occur and will reduce the crack resistance of the tool surface especially under thermal shock conditions. The hot working steel DIN- 1. 2367 (X 38 CrMoV 5) is currently one of the most often used chromium-molybdenum tool steels in the field of forging. Exemplary for this material is the influence of the nitriding parameters like temperature, nitrogen supply and plasma parameters on the nitriding depth, the maximum hardness and the <b>crack</b> <b>sensitivity</b> will be discussed. Nitrided samples will be investigated with methods developed for the adhesion measurement of hard coatings.

30|$|Arc welding is {{a widely}} used joining method for {{aluminium}} alloys. Intense variations of energy, mass and momentum transfer occur {{from time to time}} at the terminating end of the weld, resulting in unsteady temperature and fluid flow fields. The lack of metal ductility and tensile stress promote crack formation. Utilization of an appropriate dilution ratio and control of minor alloying elements, grain refinement and magnetic arc oscillations can minimise its occurrence. At certain compositional limits, the amount of eutectic liquid is large enough to form continuous films at grain boundaries. This combined with high shrinkage leads to solidification cracking. In solute-rich aluminium alloys, <b>crack</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is very low since eutectic is abundant that it backfills and heals incipient cracks.|$|E

With additional information on the kinetics of phase transformations obtained by weld simulation, it is shown that a phenomenological modelling approach can be used for choosing appropriate procedures for applications where it is desired to obtain the maximum possible refinement of microstructures in the weld metal and heat affected zone. The effect of a refinement in the solidification structures in pulsed welds on the susceptibility to soldification cracking has been studied {{with the help of a}} slow-bend transvarestraint test method. This testing method is specially suited for studying the cracking tendency under dynamic conditions such as those prevailing in pulsed welds. First, with tests on constant current welds, it is shown that the susceptibility of a material to solidification cracking can be estimated in a sensitive manner. This data also provided the basis for evaluating the effects of pulsed welding on the <b>cracking</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Work carried out on two austenitic stainless steels showed that pulsed welding leads to a refinement in the solidification structures.
