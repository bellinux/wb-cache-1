40|$|We present {{additional}} magic wavelengths (λ_magic) for the <b>clock</b> <b>transitions</b> in the {{alkaline-earth metal}} ions considering circular polarized light aside from our previously reported values in [J. Kaur et al., Phys. Rev. A 92, 031402 (R) (2015) ] for the linearly polarized light. Contributions from the vector component to the dynamic dipole polarizabilities (α_d(ω)) {{of the atomic}} states associated with the <b>clock</b> <b>transitions</b> play major roles {{in the evaluation of}} these λ_magic, hence facilitating in choosing circular polarization of lasers in the experiments. Moreover, the actual <b>clock</b> <b>transitions</b> in these ions are carried out among the hyperfine levels. The λ_magic values in these hyperfine transitions are estimated and found to be different from λ_magic for the atomic transitions due to different contributions coming from the vector and tensor part of α_d(ω). Importantly, we also present λ_magic values that depend only on the scalar component of α_d(ω) for their uses in a specially designed trap geometry for these ions {{so that they can be}} used unambiguously among any hyperfine levels of the atomic states of the <b>clock</b> <b>transitions.</b> We also present α_d(ω) values explicitly at the 1064 nm for the atomic states associated with the <b>clock</b> <b>transitions</b> which may be useful for creating "high-field seeking" traps for the above ions using the Nd:YAG laser. The tune out wavelengths at which the states would be free from the Stark shifts are also presented.

50|$|Some {{synchronous}} devices {{provide a}} clock signal to synchronize data transmission, especially at higher data rates. Two timing signals {{are provided by}} the DCE on pins 15 and 17. Pin 15 is the transmitter clock, or send timing (ST); the DTE puts the next bit on the data line (pin 2) when this <b>clock</b> <b>transitions</b> from OFF to ON (so it is stable during the ON to OFF transition when the DCE registers the bit). Pin 17 is the receiver clock, or receive timing (RT); the DTE reads the next bit from the data line (pin 3) when this <b>clock</b> <b>transitions</b> from ON to OFF.|$|R
50|$|The HS link's 8B/12B code is a {{balanced}} paired disparity code, {{so there is}} no net power transfer. It arranges this by keeping a running disparity, a count of the average number of ones and zeros. It uses the running disparity to selectively invert characters. An inverted character is marked with a set invert bit. 8B/12B also guarantees a <b>clock</b> <b>transition</b> on each character.|$|E
50|$|The vernier {{method is}} more involved. The method {{involves}} a triggerable oscillator and a coincidence circuit. At the event, the integer clock count is stored and the oscillator is started. The triggered oscillator {{has a slightly}} different frequency than the clock oscillator. For sake of argument, say the triggered oscillator has a period that is 1 ns faster than the clock. If the event happened 67 ns after the last clock, then the triggered oscillator transition will slide by &minus;1 ns after each subsequent clock pulse. The triggered oscillator will be at 66 ns after the next clock, at 65 ns after the second clock, and so forth. A coincidence detector looks for when the triggered oscillator and the <b>clock</b> <b>transition</b> at the same time, and that indicates the fraction time {{that needs to be}} added.|$|E
50|$|In most VLSI devices, {{maximum power}} {{dissipation}} {{is due to the}} clock network and clocked sequential elements. It can account to anywhere between 25% - 40% of the total power according to the variation of parameters like clock frequency, deeper pipelining etc. in a design. Sequential elements, latches and flip flops dissipate power when there is switching in their internal capacitance. This may happen with every clock transition/pulse into the sequential element. Sometimes the sequential elements need to change their state, but sometimes they retain their state and their output remains the same, before and after the clock pulse. This leads to unnecessary dissipation of power due to <b>clock</b> <b>transition.</b> If flip flops are designed {{in such a way that}} they are able to gate the clock with respective to their own internal data path, only to use the clock when needed, power dissipation can be brought down.|$|E

Regardless of this strong perturbation, precision spectroscopy may be still carried out using specially crafted, "magic" trapping fields. Finding these conditions for particularly valuable microwave <b>clock</b> <b>transitions</b> in alkalis {{has so far}} remained an open challenge. Here I demonstrate that the microwave <b>clock</b> <b>transitions</b> for alkalis may be indeed made impervious to both trapping laser intensity and fluctuations of magnetic fields.

The method significantly reduces the experimental complexity of gate operations with dressed-state qubits, as well as allowing {{all three of the}} dressed states to be prepared and detected, thereby providing access to a qutrit that is well protected from magnetic field noise. In addition, we demonstrate individual addressing of the <b>clock</b> <b>transitions</b> in two ions using a strong static magnetic field gradient, showing that our method can be used to prepare and detect microwave dressed states in a string of ions when performing multi-ion quantum operations with microwave and radio frequency fields.

5000|$|In Fig3, {{the circuit}} shows how data {{transition}} technique can {{be beneficial for}} power saving. The XNOR logical function is performed on the input of the D Flip-Flop and the output Q. When Q and D are equal, output of the logical XNOR will be zero thereby gating the internal clock and generating no internal clock. Referring to Fig3, {{we can see that}} the circuit can be broken down into 3 parts, namely data-transition look ahead, pulse generator, clock generator. The pulse generator output is given into the clock generator which is used to clock the D flip Flop. Based on the input and output signals, if {{there is a need to}} change the state of the D flop then the clock is allowed to switch to cause a transition else the clock is not allowed to transition. When the clock is not to make a transition, some time has been already spent in computing the logic and data from the D input may make it through the first stage of the D flop and some power is consumed. this power consumption is still less than what an ordinary flop would have consumed with a <b>clock</b> <b>transition</b> and no change in output. As it can be noticed the pulse generator is still generating pulse at every external clock edge. This too can be controlled and a technique that controls this part of the circuit is Clock On Demand.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{introduces}} a new method for synthesizing clock gating conditions from existing logic. Clock gating inserts combinational logic along the clock path {{to prevent the}} unnecessary switching of registers and reduce dynamic power consumption. The conditions under which the transition of a register may be safely blocked can either be explicitly specified by the designer or detected automatically. Our automatic method is scalable, utilizing simulation and satisfiability tests and necessitating no symbolic representation. It also requires no synthesis of new logic other than the clock gate itself. The algorithm seeks to generate the smallest number of gates to block {{the largest number of}} <b>clock</b> <b>transitions</b> by heuristically selecting maximally compatible gating conditions for multiple registers.
