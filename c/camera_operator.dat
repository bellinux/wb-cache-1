5|$|During filming, {{the crew}} and several cast members objected to cinematographer Michael Seresin and <b>camera</b> <b>operator</b> John Stanier's European style of single-source lighting, which {{involved}} the use of incense burners. In response, representatives of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) halted the production, and forbade Parker from using smoke on the set due to the noxious atmosphere it created.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} Mario {{receiving}} {{a letter from}} Princess Peach inviting {{him to come to}} her castle for a cake she has baked for him. Mario arrives at Peach's castle, along with Luigi and Wario. The trio disappear as they enter the castle, and Lakitu, the game's <b>camera</b> <b>operator,</b> informs Yoshi of the disappearance. Yoshi explores Peach's castle to find Mario, Luigi, Wario and Peach.|$|E
5|$|Body of Lies was Alexander Witt's first credit as a {{director}} of photography; he had collaborated with Ridley Scott on six feature films previously, beginning as a second unit <b>camera</b> <b>operator</b> on Black Rain (1989). He shot the film in the Super 35 format with spherical lenses, and explained that these lenses offer more flexibility for interior and night pictures than the anamorphic alternative. They used Kodak Vision2 500T 5218 instead of Technicolor's OZ process, which did not perform well in tests in the Moroccan desert.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{factors contributing}} {{to the effectiveness of}} <b>camera</b> <b>operators</b> in urban <b>camera</b> surveillance. The use of camera surveillance has taken an enormous flight in the past decades. Despite this increase, its effectiveness is strongly debated. One reason for the disputed effectiveness may be that an understanding of how to use camera surveillance, including elements contributing to the effectiveness of <b>camera</b> <b>operators,</b> has not kept track with technological developments. This paper focuses on the role of expertise and familiarity with the environment on the effectiveness of <b>camera</b> <b>operators</b> to detect offenders in video footage from Rotterdam City Surveillance in the Netherlands. Results show no effect of expertise, but do show that familiarity with the location contributes to operator effectiveness and that <b>camera</b> <b>operators</b> seem to use different criteria for detecting and selecting suspects depending on the familiarity with the location. These results contribute to our understanding of operator effectiveness and offer guidelines for the training of <b>camera</b> <b>operators.</b> Implications are discussed. © 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited...|$|R

5|$|Many of {{the special}} effects in A Trip to the Moon, as in {{numerous}} other Méliès films, were created using the substitution splice technique, in which the <b>camera</b> <b>operator</b> stopped filming long enough for something onscreen to be altered, added, or taken away. Méliès carefully spliced the resulting shots together to create apparently magical effects, such as {{the transformation of the}} astronomers' telescopes into stools or the disappearance of the exploding Selenites in puffs of smoke. Other effects were created using theatrical means, such as stage machinery and pyrotechnics. The film also features transitional dissolves.|$|E
5|$|Renoir {{continued}} shooting additional {{scenes with}} some of the actors. The opening scene at the airfield was shot in mid-June at the Bourget Airport {{in the middle of the}} night with whatever extras they could find. Renoir had almost run out of money when he filmed the car crash scene, which was shot very quickly with Alain Renoir as the <b>camera</b> <b>operator.</b> Renoir never liked the scene and initially removed it. The principal photography was nine and a half weeks over schedule when it was finally wrapped in June.|$|E
5|$|To {{enhance the}} {{illusion}} of the puppets, David Lane ensured that camera shots frequently omitted {{the tops of the}} heads and the visible control wires, and also incorporated low-angle shots for dramatic effect. Location shooting in Portugal was arranged for Lane, Derek Meddings and <b>camera</b> <b>operator</b> Alan Perry to film overhead landscape shots for the climax in which Alan rescues the Zero-X astronauts during re-entry. However, when the footage was deemed unsatisfactory, it was replaced with a painted backdrop made by associate producer Reg Hill.|$|E

The staff writers were Lindelof, Cuse, co-executive producer Steven Maeda, supervising producer Javier Grillo-Marxuach, supervising producers Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz, supervising producer Leonard Dick, supervising producer Jeph Loeb, supervising producer Craig Wright, producer Elizabeth Sarnoff and Christina M. Kim. The regular directors were Bender, producer Stephen Williams, <b>camera</b> <b>operator</b> Paul Edwards and Eric Laneuville. Lindelof and Cuse served as the show runners.|$|E
5|$|Waldman was {{the head}} of Group TR-6 (Airborne Measurements) for the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945. He {{developed}} microphones that were dropped by parachute to measure the effect of the blast. He was then assigned to Project Alberta, the part of the Manhattan Project that oversaw the preparation of facilities to test and deploy nuclear weapons, and support their use during the actual missions. As such, he participated in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, as a <b>camera</b> <b>operator</b> on the observation aircraft. He was equipped with a special high-speed Fastax movie camera with six seconds of film in order to record the blast. Unfortunately, Waldman forgot to open the camera shutter, and no film was exposed.|$|E
5|$|Agreeing to fund {{half of the}} {{proposed}} £1million budget, the Hong Kong Shaw Brothers became partners in the film's production. Elder brother Sir Run Run Shaw is credited as the presenter of Inseminoid in the opening titles. With a production staff of 75, principal photography commenced on 12 May 1980. John Metcalfe, <b>camera</b> <b>operator</b> for Satan's Slave and Terror, {{assumed the role of}} cinematographer. His former role fell to the less experienced Dick Pope. Three weeks of location filming at the Chislehurst Caves in Kent preceded a one-week indoor session at Lee International Studios at Wembley Park in London. The second unit completed special effects and linking shots in a fifth week, based at Film House in Wardour Street. To simulate the desolate landscape of the alien planet in long shots, the production team departed for the island of Gozo off Malta for a final shoot of two days, capitalising on the strong Mediterranean sun to produce good lighting.|$|E

5|$|Baroness Jenny Jones, the Green party's {{candidate}} in the 2012 election, and Natalie Bennett, leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, declined to stand for the Green nomination. Six candidates were shortlisted for the nomination, with Siân Berry, the party's {{candidate in}} the 2008 election, selected by London-based members of the Green Party. Unsuccessful nominees were Jonathan Bartley (candidate for Streatham in the 2015 general election, co-founder of Ekklesia, and Work and Pensions Spokesperson for the Green Party); Tom Chance (candidate for Lewisham West and Penge in the 2015 general election and Housing Spokesperson for the Greens); Benali Hamdach (Equalities Spokesperson for the Green Party, and former National Health Service researcher); Rashid Nix (a <b>Camera</b> <b>operator</b> and candidate for Dulwich and West Norwood in the 2015 general election); and Caroline Russell (Islington Borough Councillor for Highbury East Ward since 2014 and clean air campaigner).|$|E
5|$|For {{slow motion}} scenes like with bullets and drops of water, twin Phantom {{high-speed}} cameras were used which filmed 200 frames per second. A fight scene with Wesker and Chris in the Resident Evil 5 game was recreated shot-by-shot {{for the film}} and the Phantom cameras were used to create Wesker's superhuman speed which took about two days to film. The added size and weight of the 3D cameras meant the filmmakers {{were not able to}} use existing equipment such as Steadicam rigs. Instead the <b>camera</b> <b>operator</b> worked on a Segway to achieve the look of a Steadicam shot. Much of the action scenes were shot in front of a green screen. A 1983 Yak-52 was used throughout the film by Jovovich and Larter. Stunt pilot Martin Mattes was dressed like Jovovich and flew the plane for the camera.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, {{producer}} Elliott Kastner {{met with}} Alan Parker at Pinewood Studios {{to discuss a}} film adaptation of the novel. Parker, who had read the book following its publication, agreed to write the screenplay. He met with Hjortsberg in London before moving to New York City, where he wrote most of the script. After completing the first draft in September 1985, Parker traveled to Rome, Italy, where he brought the script to Mario Kassar and Andrew G. Vajna. The two producers agreed to finance the film through their studio, Carolco Pictures, and Parker was given creative control. Pre-production work began in January 1986 in New York, where Parker selected the creative team, reuniting with several of his past collaborators, including producer Alan Marshall, director of photography Michael Seresin, <b>camera</b> <b>operator</b> Michael Roberts, production designer Brian Morris and editor Gerry Hambling.|$|E

5|$|In September 1987, Alan Parker {{was given}} a copy of Gerolmo's script by Orion's {{executive}} vice president and co-founder, Mike Medavoy. When Parker traveled to Tokyo, Japan to act as a juror for the 1987 Tokyo International Film Festival, his colleague Robert F. Colesberry began researching the time period, and compiled books, newspaper articles, live news footage and photographs related to the 1964 murders. Upon returning to the United States, Parker met with Colesberry in New York and spent several months viewing the research. The director also began selecting the creative team; the production of Mississippi Burning reunited Parker with many of his past collaborators, including Colesberry, casting directors Howard Feuer and Juliet Taylor, director of photography Peter Biziou, editor Gerry Hambling, costume designer Aude Bronson-Howard, production designer Geoffrey Kirkland, <b>camera</b> <b>operator</b> Michael Roberts, and music composer Trevor Jones.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{originally}} planned to shoot scenes in Oakland, California before visiting the actual Philadelphia locations {{described in the}} novel. Upon arriving in Philadelphia, he and producer Alan Marshall set up production offices at a Holiday Inn hotel. Location scouting began as Parker was holding casting calls in New York City. Location manager Rory Enke and production designer Geoffrey Kirkland visited run-down areas of Philadelphia, and offered suggestions to Parker on his weekend visits from New York. Parker made an arrangement with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) that permitted the British crew members to work alongside members of both {{the east and west}} coast union locals. He had to employ no less than four members of the two camera locals in order to allow his past collaboratorsdirector of photography Michael Seresin, <b>camera</b> <b>operator</b> Michael Roberts and editor Gerry Hamblingto work on the film.|$|E
5|$|Partway {{through the}} series, the show's unseen <b>camera</b> <b>operator</b> and editor, Robert Walton, dies from a fall while adventuring in Alaska, where {{his body is}} left {{partially}} preserved in the snow. Frankenstein becomes distraught and attempts to revive Walton's corpse with DeLacey's help in secret using the medical technologies she had expounded upon earlier in the show. The attempt is successful, but the revived creature is startled by light and escapes the lab, running into the woods. Later, as Frankenstein and Lavenza are trying to locate the creature from her father's basement, Clerval is killed mysteriously while camping. The creature confronts Frankenstein and asks her {{to make him a}} friend. She grows morally opposed to the idea of recreating her experiment and agrees to run off to Costa Rica with Lavenza after he confesses his love to her. The creature returns to her makeshift lab and kills Lavenza in anger after he tries to stop it from hurting Frankenstein.|$|E

5|$|The {{cast and}} crew arrived in Sologne between February 6 and 15. Renoir's son Alain worked as an {{assistant}} <b>camera</b> <b>operator</b> and Dido Freire worked as the script girl. Renoir's assistants on the film were Koch, Zwobada and Henri Cartier-Bresson. Tony Corteggianni {{was hired as a}} technical advisor for the rabbit hunting sequence. The {{cast and crew}} stayed at Hotel Rat in Lamotte-Beuvron. Heavy rainfall prevented the start of shooting in Sologne for several weeks and Renoir rewrote parts of the script to accommodate the rain. While he finished the script the entire company played cards and bonded; they described it as a happy time in their lives just before the horrors of World War II began. Paulette Dubost said shooting the film was great fun.|$|E
5|$|The sex scene {{involving}} Rourke and Bonet {{was filmed}} {{in one of}} the unused buildings located on Royal Street and took four hours to shoot. Parker limited the crew down to himself, cinematographer Michael Seresin, <b>camera</b> <b>operator</b> Michael Roberts and the camera assistant. To make the actors more comfortable, Parker played music during the shoot. Production then moved to a corner of New Orleans, which doubled for flashback sequences set in 1943 Times Square, New York. The crew then discovered an unused bus depot, which was used to film scenes set in Ethan Krusemark's gumbo hut. Filming then moved to the St. Alphonsus Church, where the crew filmed a dialogue scene between Angel and Cyphre. Production returned to Royal Street in the French Quarter, where the final confrontation between Angel and Cyphre, and the film's ending were shot.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} mainly shot on Kodak Vision3 250D film stock. Scenes where Oscar is alive were {{shot in the}} super 35 format with Arricam LT cameras, and the rest in super 16 with an Aaton XTR Prod. The cinematographer was Benoît Debie, who also shot Irréversible. As in Irréversible, Noé was {{reluctant}} to use artificial lighting that would destroy the illusion if the camera was turned around. Thanks to Tokyo's many neon signs, very little additional lighting was required for the exterior scenes, {{despite the fact that}} many were shot late at night. For the interior scenes Debie mainly used practical, in-frame light sources. Some exceptions were made. One was that the moods of the characters were meant to be indicated by different colours, ranging from orange to purple with occasional greens. For this, Debie used a set of red, green, and blue programmable disco lights, which allowed for all different hues. The disco lights were easy to hide. They were also used for simulation of neon flashes, and to add a tint of red to the dressing-room scenes. Another exception was the use of strobe lights, which were programmed together with the coloured lights. Blue colour was avoided throughout, since the filmmakers did not associate it with dreams. Noé was the film's <b>camera</b> <b>operator,</b> except for a few shots of Oscar running in the streets, as they required a taller cameraman. In those scenes, the camera was held by Debie.|$|E
