40|$|Pointwise image {{formation}} models {{appear in a}} variety of <b>computational</b> vision and <b>photography</b> problems. Prior studies aim to recover visibility or reflectance under the effects of specular or indirect reflections, additive scattering, radiance attenuation in haze and flash, etc. This work considers bounds to recovery from pointwise degradation. The analysis uses a physical model for the acquired signal and noise, and also accounts for potential post-acquisition noise filtering. Linear-systems analysis yields an effective cutofffrequency, which is induced by noise, despite having no optical blur in the imaging model. We apply this analysis to hazy images. The result is a tool that assesses the ability to recover (within a desirable success rate) an object or feature having a certain size, distance from the camera, and radiance difference from its nearby background, per attenuation coefficient of the medium. The bounds rely on the camera specifications. The theory considers the pointwise degradation that exists in the scene during acquisition, which fundamentally limits recovery, even if the parameters of an algorithm are perfectly set. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Light-field imaging can be scaled up to a {{very large}} area, to map the Earth’s {{atmosphere}} in 3 D. Multiview spaceborne instru-ments suffer low spatio-temporal-angular resolution, and are very ex-pensive and unscalable. We develop sky light-field imaging, by a wide, scalable network of wide-angle cameras looking upwards, which upload their data to the cloud. This new type of imaging-system poses new <b>computational</b> vision and <b>photography</b> problems, some of which gener-alize prior monocular tasks. These include radiometric self-calibration across a network, overcoming flare by a network, and background esti-mation. On the other hand, network redundancy offers solutions to these problems, which we derive. Based on such solutions, the light-field net-work enables unprecedented ways to measure nature. We demonstrate this experimentally by 3 D recovery of clouds, in high spatio-temporal resolution. It is achieved by space carving of the volumetric distribu-tion of semi-transparent clouds. Such sensing can complement satellite imagery, be useful to meteorology, make aerosol tomography realizable, and give new, powerful tools to atmospheric and avian wildlife scientists...|$|R

40|$|The {{automatic}} evaluation of images in <b>computational</b> cinema and <b>photography</b> is a challenging problem. There are neither comprehensive rules nor adequate training data {{to develop an}} expert system. This thesis presents the design and implementation of a computer game for synthesizing image data, and an experimental framework for learning photographic composition preferences from online ratings. 	The first topic addressed {{is the development of}} Panorama, a computer game for photographic composition research. Panorama generates images through gameplay by simulating the task of photography in a virtual environment. The synthesized photographs are automatically annotated from their underlying representation, and contribute to a corpus of images with well-defined visual features. Both the game and data are publicly available to support research in image analysis. 	The second topic is a photograph learning experiment using data from the Panorama corpus. In this section, machine learning is used for predicting user preferences of images, based on computed visual features. Image preference ratings are acquired by crowdsourcing to consider subjectivity across many individuals. Using this unique data collection process, it is shown how the framework can be applied to reason about image quality with respect to photographic composition...|$|R
40|$|Purpose To {{study the}} {{fundamental}} {{effects of the}} spinning capsule on the overall performance of a dry powder inhaler (Aerolizer®). Methods The capsule motion was visualized using high-speed <b>photography.</b> <b>Computational</b> fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed to determine the flowfield generated in the device with and without the presence of different sized capsules at 60 l min– 1. The inhaler dispersion performance was measured with mannitol powder using a multistage liquid impinger at the same flowrate. Results The capsule size (3, 4, and 5) was found to make no significant difference to the device flowfield, the particle-device impaction frequency, or the dispersion performance of the inhaler. Reducing the capsule size reduced only the capsule retention by 4 %. In contrast, without {{the presence of the}} spinning capsule, turbulence levels were increased by 65 %, FPFEm (wt% particles 6. 8 m in the aerosol referenced against the amount of powder emitted from the device) increased from 59 % to 65 %, while particle-mouthpiece impaction decreased by 2. 5 times. When the powder was dispersed from within compared to from outside the spinning capsule containing four 0. 6 mm holes at each end, the FPFEm was increased significantly from 59 % to 76 %, and the throat retention was dropped from 14 % to 6 %. Conclusions The presence, but not the size, of a capsule has significant effects on the inhaler performance. The results suggested that impaction between the particles and the spinning capsule does not {{play a major role in}} powder dispersion. However, the capsule can provide additional strong mechanisms of deagglomeration dependent on the size of the capsule hole...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{streaming}} is {{a fundamental}} nonlinear phenomenon resulting from high frequency vibration in fluids. Known and investigated by Rayleigh and contemporary scientists, it attracts renewed interest due to the availability of powerful <b>computational</b> tools, advanced <b>photography</b> and precise laser velocimetry instrumentation, which can produce accurate experimental results. Its physical mechanism however is still not clearly understood. The analysis appears limited by the traditional premises of harmonic analysis, radiation force and wave propagation and reflection with the focus on nonlinear terms of the inertial frame formulations. Following our earlier analysis of nonlinear effects on rigid particles in a streaming fluid using time domain (TD) finite element (FE) analysis with a moving mesh via Comsol™, we present the modelling of ultrasonic streaming alone. We use {{state of the art}} laser velocimetry instrumentation to measure the average velocity of 0. 5 μm latex tracer particles in a 0. 3 - 4 mms- 1 streaming water insonified in the 1 MHz frequency range. We use LabView™ virtual instrument to analyse light scattered by a swarm of particles in the moving fringes of crossed laser beams and find the ensemble particle motion from the frequency spectrum of the signal. In order to verify the FE modelling results with respect to the streaming velocity, the electric power is monitored at the transducer terminals. Our FE simulation, based on the Navier-Stokes (NS) equation for viscous incompressible fluids, does not involve wave propagation and radiation but is capable of representing the transient development of streaming, effects of boundaries and effects of the character of the ultrasonic source. Our investigation shows that streaming is neither implied by a time-varying topology nor associated with the asymmetry or even with the movement of the source or the fluid surface. Surprisingly, the streaming velocity is increased by making the enclosure fully symmetrical...|$|R
