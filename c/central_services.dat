25|$|During this time, Sam {{comes in}} contact with Tuttle, who once worked for <b>Central</b> <b>Services</b> but left due to his dislike of the tedious and {{repetitive}} paperwork. Tuttle helps Sam deal with two <b>Central</b> <b>Services</b> workers, Spoor and Dowser, who return to demolish Sam's ducts and seize his apartment {{under the guise of}} fixing the air conditioning. Sam discovers {{that the only way to}} learn about Jill is to get transferred to Information Retrieval, where he can access her classified records. He had previously turned down a promotion arranged by his mother, Ida, who is obsessed with the rejuvenating plastic surgery of cosmetic surgeon Dr. Jaffe. Sam retracts his refusal by speaking with Deputy Minister Mr. Helpmann at a party hosted by Ida. Obtaining Jill's records, Sam tracks her down before she can be arrested, then falsifies the records to fake her death, allowing her to escape pursuit. The two share a romantic night together, but are soon apprehended by the government at gunpoint. Charged with treason for abusing his new position, Sam is restrained to a chair in a large, empty cylindrical room, to be tortured by his old friend, Jack Lint.

25|$|The {{building}} system boundary is split into a physical boundary which determines which renewable resources are considered (e.g. in buildings footprint, on-site or even off-site, see) respectively how many buildings {{are included in}} the balance (single building, cluster of buildings) and a balance boundary which determines the included energy uses (e.g. heating, cooling, ventilation, hot water, lighting, appliances, IT, <b>central</b> <b>services,</b> electric vehicles, and embodied energy, etc.). It should be noticed that renewable energy supply options can be prioritized (e.g. by transportation or conversion effort, availability over the lifetime of the building or replication potential for future, etc.) and therefore create a hierarchy. It may be argued that resources within the building footprint or on-site should be given priority over off-site supply options.|$|E

25|$|On October 21, 2014, {{the paper}} {{announced}} it would begin printing and packaging The Times-Picayune in Mobile, Ala., sometime in late 2015 or early 2016, closing the plant on Howard Avenue in New Orleans and eliminating more than 100 jobs at Advance <b>Central</b> <b>Services</b> Louisiana.
