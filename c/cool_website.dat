As web creators, we need to rethink the “what ” as much as the “how ” of website design. People who create websites need a template or rubric to make decisions. A rubric is a tool for assessing where you are and {{where you want to go}} in the future. The rubric can be used by anyone at anytime to determine where he or she is when creating and maintaining an effective website. The Ribble/Bailey Rubric for Creating and Maintaining a Website Rubric (see Figure 1) is a powerful tool for web designers and deals with the main themes of web design and maintenance.

The incident also inspired experimental band The Mae Shi to write the song, [...] "R U Professional", which features samples from the recording; similarly, Lucian Piane's remix [...] "Bale Out" [...] is composed almost entirely of audio from the incident. Stephen Colbert parodied the incident on the 4 February 2009 episode of The Colbert Report, in which guest Steve Martin repeatedly walked {{in front of the}} camera and was berated by Colbert.

5000|$|Reactions to {{the site}} from film bloggers and other {{observers}} have been generally positive.

In a June 2009 article, Scott Weinberg of Cinematical called it [...] "easily the <b>coolest</b> movie <b>website</b> of the year" [...] and described himself as [...] "tickled, fascinated, enamored and addicted".
