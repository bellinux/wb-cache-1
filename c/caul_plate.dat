30|$|Air-injection holes (on {{the lower}} plate) of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5  mm in {{diameter}} at a spacing of 25 and 50  mm between {{the centers of}} adjacent holes were used. There were 121 holes {{in an area of}} 250  ×  250  mm for the 25 -mm spacing and 36 holes for the 50 -mm spacing. Holes were also punched on the <b>caul</b> <b>plate</b> (upper plate) through which the high-pressure air and vapor were discharged. Also on the <b>caul</b> <b>plate</b> were 121 and 36 holes in an area of 250  ×  250  mm for the 25 - and 50 -mm spacing, respectively. Grooves that were 1.5 -mm deep and 1 -mm wide were also cut connecting the holes {{on one side of the}} <b>caul</b> <b>plate</b> to discharge the high-pressure air. The diameter and spacing of the holes on the <b>caul</b> <b>plate</b> were the same as those on the lower plate. For example, the hole diameter and spacing on the <b>caul</b> <b>plate</b> would be 1 and 25  mm, respectively, if the hole diameter and spacing on the lower plate were 1 and 5  mm, respectively. See refs. [4, 5] and [10] for further details on the air-injection press.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} an {{experimental study of}} the influence of embedded defects created during automated fiber tape placement, on the mechanical properties of carbon/epoxy composites. Two stacking sequences have been examined, [(- 45 °/+ 45 °) 3 /- 45 °] and [90 ° 4 / 0 ° 3 / 90 ° 4], in which gaps and overlaps have been introduced during fiber placement. These materials have been cured in an autoclave either with or without a <b>caul</b> <b>plate,</b> then analyzed by ultrasonic C-scan. The microstructures were characterized by scanning electron microscopy. In-plane shear tests were performed on the ± 45 ° laminates and showed that the use of a <b>caul</b> <b>plate</b> does not affect mechanical behavior of plies in the embedded defect region. Compression tests were performed on 0 / 90 ° laminates and in this case the presence of a <b>caul</b> <b>plate</b> is critical during polymerization as it prevents thickness variations and allows defects to heal...|$|E
30|$|The air-injection {{pressure}} {{was set at}} 0.55  MPa, with air being injected at room temperature. Air injection was started when the board thickness reached 10 or 30  mm and was then stopped for the final 15  s of the pressing time. An air-injection device was prepared with holes measuring 1  mm in diameter. The holes were arranged on the lower plate with a spacing of 25  mm between the centers of adjacent holes, resulting in 81 holes in an area measuring 200  ×  200  mm through which air was injected. Holes were also punched on the <b>caul</b> <b>plate</b> (upper plate) through which high-pressure air and vapor were discharged (Fig.  1 c). Because the diameter of and spacing between the holes on the <b>caul</b> <b>plate</b> were equal to those on the air-injection device, this device also contained 81 holes on the <b>caul</b> <b>plate</b> {{in an area of}} 200  ×  200  mm. To discharge high-pressure air, grooves 1.5 -mm deep and 3 -mm wide were cut to connect the holes {{on one side of the}} <b>caul</b> <b>plate.</b> Although holes must actually be punched in the heating plates of the hot press, it is difficult to do so. Therefore, in this study, an air-injection device was developed and subsequently mounted on the heating plate. The structure of the air-injection press is described in previous studies [5 – 7].|$|E
40|$|Automated fibre {{placement}} (AFP) {{enables the}} trajectory of unidirectional composite tape to be optimized, but laying down complex shapes with this technology can result in the introduction of defects. The aim of this experimental study is to investigate the influence of gaps and overlaps on the microstructure and tensile properties of carbon-epoxy laminates. First, a comparison between a hand-layup and AFP layup, draped and cured under the same conditions, shows equivalent microstructures and tensile properties. This provides the reference values for the study. Then, gap and overlap embedded defects (more or less severe) are introduced during manufacturing, on two cross-ply layups [(0 °/(90 °) 5 / 0 °] and [(90 °/ 0 °) 2 / 90 °]. Autoclave cure without a <b>caul</b> <b>plate</b> results in local thickness variation and microstructural changes which depend on the defect type. This has a strong influence on mechanical performance. Use of a <b>caul</b> <b>plate</b> avoids these variations {{and in this case}} embedded defects hardly affect tensile properties...|$|E
30|$|Small (A)- {{and large}} (B)-sized {{particles}} were mixed separately with PET powder for 6  min in a rotary-type blender for producing a homogeneous composite {{by following the}} formulation, as illustrated in Table  1. Uniform mats were formed by placing the mixture on an aluminium <b>caul</b> <b>plate</b> using a forming box. The WPCs were fabricated according to the press cycle reported by Chen et al. [6]. The press cycle of this study involves maximum pressing temperature (190  °C), pressure (5  N/mm 2), pressing time (5  min), and pressure holding time, i.e., cold pressing (6  min). To avoid the degradation of wood components, pressing temperature (190  °C) was set below the melting temperature (260  °C) of PET [3]. Six replications of each type of WPC panels with 300 [*]×[*] 250 [*]×[*] 6  mm dimension were fabricated. The WPC panels were trimmed and conditioned {{at room temperature for}} 48  h before testing.|$|E
40|$|A double {{vacuum bag}} molding {{assembly}} with improved void management and laminate net shape control {{which provides a}} double vacuum enviromnent for use in fabricating composites from prepregs containing air and/or volatiles such as reactive resin matrix composites or composites from solvent containing prepregs with non-reactive resins matrices. By using two vacuum environments during the curing process, a vacuum can be drawn during a B-stage of a two-step cycle without placing the composite under significant relative pressure. During the final cure stage, a significant pressure can be applied by releasing the vacuum {{in one of the}} two environments. Inner and outer bags are useful for creating the two vacuum environments with a perforated tool intermediate the two. The composite is placed intermediate a tool plate and a <b>caul</b> <b>plate</b> in the first environment with the inner bag and tool plate defining the first environment. The second environment is characterized by the outer bag which is placed over the inner bag and the tool plate...|$|E
40|$|Selected {{physical}} and mechanical properties of cement bonded board produced from Gliricidia sepium were assessed. The following board properties were evaluated, water absorption, thickness swelling, water absorption and thickness swelling following accelerated aging, {{modulus of rupture}} and modulus of elasticity. The Board formation was based on cement: wood ratio 1 : 1, 2 : 1 and 3 : 1, board densities of 800, 900 and 1000 kg/m 3 on dry weight basis. The quantity of cement, particles, and water {{for the production of}} each board was weighed, mixed separately and very well in order to prevent the formation of particles lumps. Blended mixture was transferred and formed inside a nominal mould dimension of 650 mm in length, 650 mm in width and 13 mm thickness on a <b>caul</b> <b>plate</b> that was covered with polythene sheet before plywood was laid {{at the top of the}} mat. The mean value for water absorption and thickness swelling ranged from 3. 06 to 6. 99...|$|E
40|$|The {{growing demand}} for {{structural}} composite wood panels has created an op-portunity for novel cost effective binder systems. Recently, much data has been published extolling the virtues of isocyanates (PMDI) as binders for composite wood panels intended for exterior applications. To date, {{there are two main}} drawbacks which inhibit the wide spread use of PMDI as binders: 1) generally, isocyanates are more expensive than the commonly used formaldehyde binder systems and 2) isocyanates adhere strongly to the <b>caul</b> <b>plate</b> during the pressing cycle. To overcome this sticking problem, release agents are necessary which in-creases the overall cost of an isocyanate binder system. This study was undertaken to investigate the cost/performance of isocyanate binder systems which incorporate significant levels of low cost reactive diluents. Several binder systems were evaluated which were cost/performance effective when compared to phenol-formaldehyde (exterior) and urea-formaldehyde (inter-ior) binders for composite wood panels. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that propylene carbonate (PC) is one such effective diluent in conjunction with isocyanates. The data indicates that ac-ceptable composite wood panels, both exterior and interior grade, can be pro...|$|E
30|$|The UF {{resin content}} was 12  wt% based on dry fiber mass and 1  wt% of {{hardener}} solid {{based on the}} resin solid content was added into the resin. The wood fibers were put into the rotary drum blender equipped with an air-atomizing spray system and then glued with the UF resin. According to target density of the MDF panel, fibers were weighed and formed into mats on an aluminum <b>caul</b> <b>plate</b> using a 500 [*]×[*] 500  mm forming box. A second such plate was laid on the top while both were covered with siliconized paper to prevent adherence between panel and plates. After cold pre-pressing at a specific pressure of 16  N/cm 2 for approximately 10 min, the mats were transferred to a computer-controlled hot press, operated in plate position control mode. Hot pressing temperature, maximal specific pressure, and press time factor were 190 [*]°C, 716  N/cm 2, and 12  s/mm (totally 192  s), respectively. Target panel thickness and density were 16  mm and 650  kg/m 3, respectively. Three replicate panels were produced from each fiber type. Prior to specimen cutting, the panels were allowed to cool and edges were trimmed. The MDF specimens without sanding were conditioned in a climatic camber having 20 [*]°C and 65 % relative humidity for 2 weeks before testing.|$|E
40|$|Advanced Composites Division has {{developed}} innovative techniques to manufacture stiffened bulk heads and sandwich panels. Special tools are established for stiffener layup that avoid the complex machining operation. The stiffeners are co-cured and co-bonded {{with the basic}} skin to gain the advantage of composite. The long experience in composite tooling enable ACD to use the sub tools in three pieces between two stiffeners that maintains straightness of the stiffener minimizing the thinning of stiffener web. As bulk head panels have so many cutouts and kinks and also the surface is non developable, the wastage of prepreg material is minimised by using the tape of different width. This innovative method of layup not only saves the material but also reduces the layup time and provides a wrinkle free surfaces. The caul plates needed for sandwich panels are obtained by derivative tooling concept. This method enhances the contact between the component and <b>caul</b> <b>plate</b> avoiding any resin rich or resin starved region. In addition a cushioning effect between the rigid tool and the component is given by a unique technology adopted by ACD. This has well explained in the process. This report describes the step-by-step procedure to realise the airworthy. ~ composite component. The process and the toolings have been fined tuned keeping tb view of series production of LCA...|$|E
