50|$|A collusive lawsuit (sometimes {{referred}} to as a <b>collusive</b> <b>action)</b> is a lawsuit in which the parties to the suit have no actual quarrel with one another, but one sues the other to achieve some result desired by both.|$|E
5000|$|The {{conveyance}} {{took the}} form of the record of a fictitious lawsuit, compromised or terminated by the acknowledgment of the existing owner (known as the deforciant, impedient or tenant, depending on the original writ used to levy the fine) that the land in question was the rightful property of the claimant (the plaintiff, querent or demandant). In reality, the deforciant had already agreed to sell the land, and the plaintiff to buy it: the suit was, in other words, a <b>collusive</b> <b>action</b> between the two parties. In the most common means of levying a fine, the plaintiff would bring a writ of covenant alleging that he and the deforciant had entered into a covenant to transfer some real property, but the deforciant had not held up his end of the bargain. In all actions used to levy a fine, before the court could render judgment, and typically on the same day the writ was returned, the parties would seek leave of the court to compromise, and then compromise on terms where the deforciant admitted that the real property was the right of the plaintiff. [...] A fine was said to be [...] "levied".|$|E
5000|$|At the Rochester spring assizes in 1686 Sir Edward Hales, a Roman Catholic, {{was convicted}} for holding and acting under a {{commission}} {{in the army}} without taking the sacrament and the oaths of supremacy and allegiance in the manner prescribed by the Test Act. Thereupon his coachman, Arthur Godden, brought a <b>collusive</b> <b>action</b> against him in the king's bench for the prescribed penalty of £500, to which Hales demurred, pleading a dispensation under the great seal. The case was argued before Herbert, who delivered formal judgment as follows : ' (1) That the kings of England are sovereign princes (2) that the laws of England are the king's laws; (3) that therefore it is an inseparable prerogative in the kings of England to dispense with penal laws in particular cases, and upon particular necessary reasons (4) that of these reasons and these necessities the king himself is the sole judge.' The plaintiff was accordingly nonsuited. The judgment occasioned general consternation in the country, and the judges were treated with scant respect on circuit. It was impugned as bad in point of law by Sir Robert Atkyns (1621-1709) in a tract entitled ' An Enquiry into the Power of dispensing with Penal Statutes.' Herbert replied with 'A Short Account of the Authorities in Law upon which judgment was given in Sir Edward Hales's case,' in which he argued that 'whatever is not prohibited by the law of God, but was lawful before any act of parliament made to forbid it, the king by his dispensation granted to a particular person may make lawful again to that person who has such dispensation, though it continues unlawful for everybody else.' Atkyns rejoined, and William Atwood, a barrister, also examined Herbert's vindication with much learning and ability.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertations}} {{includes three}} (3) chapters, each {{adding to the}} growing network games literature that incorporates incomplete information. Financial over-the-counter markets give motivating applications. (1) "Trading Networks and Equilibrium Intermediation" studies the efficiency of trade in networks. A network of intermediaries facilitates exchange between buyers and a seller. Intermediary traders face a private trading cost, a network characterizes the set of feasible transactions, and an auction mechanism sets prices. Stable networks, which are robust to agents' <b>collusive</b> <b>actions,</b> exist when cost uncertainty is acute and multiple, independent trading relationships are valuable. A free-entry process governs the formation of equilibrium networks. Such networks feature too few intermediaries relative to the optimal market organization and they exhibit an asymmetric structure amplifying the shocks experienced by key intermediaries. (2) "Interdealer Trade: Risk, Liquidity, {{and the role of}} Market Inventory" further studies traders facing private shocks, placed in a dynamic setting. Trades between ex ante symmetric, inventory carrying intermediaries ("dealers") are motivated by divergent liquidity needs of the counter parties. Market prices and asset flows are pinned by dealers' indifference between providing intermediation services and retaining liquidity to be utilized in subsequent interdealer markets. More active interdealer markets simultaneously increase the value to intermediation and the option-value to providing these services. Under infrequent shocks, interdealer trade boosts the availability of liquidity in the broader market. This boost decays with market inventory, which serves as a constraint on interdealer activity. Through this market mechanism, prices vary inversely with both search frictions between dealers and on their total current holdings. (3) "Information Acquisition and Response in Peer-effects Networks" endogenizes the quality of information that market participants carry in a general peer effects model. When pairwise peer effects are symmetric, asymmetries in acquired information are inefficiently low relative to the utilitarian benchmark. And with information privately acquired, all players face strictly positive gains to overstating their informativeness as to strategically influence the beliefs and behaviors of neighbors. If strategic substitutes in actions are present and significant, low centrality players move against their signals in anticipation of their neighbors' actions. A blueprint for optimal policy design is developed. Applications to market efficiency in financial crises and two-sided markets are discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{argue that}} readily {{available}} {{data and information}} in newspaper stories enable one to discern the nature and patterns of corruption and to understand actions taken to combat corruption. We analyze and compare numerous newspaper reports of corruption in India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. Using analysis derived from existing theory of corruption, we demonstrate how information in news accounts improves our understanding of corruption. Bangladesh had more coercive corruption, with countervailing actions dominated by direct actions of victims. In India and Sri Lanka, corruption was generally <b>collusive,</b> with countervailing <b>actions</b> on behalf of victims frequently leading to legal actions and investigative reports.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} agency problem with moral hazard, where the {{principal}} hires multiple agents, {{and can only}} imperfectly monitor their action choices by observing their correlated public signals. The principal will penalize any detected deviant only by firing her and other agents. The key assumption of the paper is that agents are divided into multiple distinct groups. Within each group, all its members can make the binding commitments to achieve their <b>collusive</b> <b>action</b> choices. It is shown {{that it may be}} easier to provide the agents with the incentive to make the most desired action choices when multiple groups are established than when either no group or only the grand group is established. It is also shown that in terms of uniqueness, relative performance evaluation through inter-group competition will work better than that through inter-individual competition. ...|$|E
40|$|To {{ensure that}} citizen suits assist {{but do not}} replace or overshadow {{government}} enforcement actions, all environmental statutes which authorize citizen suits bar such suits in certain circumstances. This short Article examines the relatively narrow but important problems created by one such bar, namely the statutory bar on a citizen suit if the federal or state government is “diligently prosecuting” an action against the same violator. The requirement that a governmental prosecution be diligent protects against two types of undesirable situations. On the one hand, the diligent prosecution bar prevents citizens from bringing simple “me too” actions. One {{would not want to}} encourage a citizen organization to wait until a government has investigated and worked up a case and then pile on the violator in the hopes of gaining money for wasteful pet projects and collecting attorneys 2 ̆ 7 fees. On the other hand, by requiring that a prosecution be diligent (and not merely in existence) before the bar applies, the statutes protect valid citizen suits from being wiped out by <b>collusive</b> <b>action</b> between a government and a violator brought specifically by the government to bar the citizen suit and force the citizens to lose the resources they have sunk into the case. Obviously, most cases involving concurrent citizen and government enforcement actions fall somewhere between these two extremes. The goal of this Article is to find a balance between these two ends and to explore means of determining just how diligent a prosecution must be to bar citizen enforcement. In examining this question, I will pay special attention to the diligent prosecution bars in the Clean Water Act because they are the most comprehensive but I will make reference to cases from other environmental statutes as well...|$|E
40|$|This Note {{will begin}} with a brief general history of growlers in the United States and the {{benefits}} they provide to consumers, retailers, and small craft brewers. Part II will {{provide an overview of}} national alcohol distribution regulation and how the present growler law exists within this larger framework. To complete the necessary background information, Part III will provide context to the competitive landscape by way of an examination of the craft beer industry’s explosive growth. The substantive portion of the Note will follow in Part IV, beginning with an outline of the various key types of growler restrictions such as the size of the vessel, the type of license that is required, and the regulatory practice of “locking” growlers to specific establishments. After this discussion, there will be an analysis and comparison of recently passed and pending key legislation in major beer producing states. Part V will review the regulatory environment for growlers within Washington State. In this section, I will argue that states should adopt laws similar to those in Washington, which by virtue of having some of the least restrictive regulations on growler use, has built a model that is beneficial to the consumer while also encouraging business growth within the state. Part VI will then focus on more controversial legislation such as Florida’s S. B. 1714 and the impact of grassroots organization within the craft beer community to counter such measures. Tied to this discussion will be a brief examination of whether the efforts of larger brewers and distributors in sponsoring bills like S. B. 1714, when viewed under the Sherman Antitrust Act, provide for the possibility of finding <b>collusive,</b> coordinated <b>action.</b> Finally, the Note concludes with proposed recommendations for the future of growler law by reiterating changes that align closer to Washington State’s regulatory model...|$|R
50|$|After World War Two, Dynamit Nobel began {{manufacturing}} plastic {{equipment and}} ammunition in West Germany {{but was not}} able to keep the factories located in the areas occupied by the Soviets. These factories were partly dismembered. From 1953, Dynamit Nobel tried to develop intermediary organic products in order not to rely completely on the plastic equipment. After deciding the rearmament of Bundeswehr, the manufacture of ammunition was restarted in 1957, at first in the factory of Liebenau by the Gesellschaft zur Verwertung chemischer Erzeugnisse mbH which had survived the war.At the beginning of the 1960s, once again, the company became the leader of the military and civil powder market in Germany, namely due to the takeover of the manufacturer of ammunitions Gustav Genschow & Co. AG de Karlsruhe in 1963. At the same time, Dynamit Nobel took an increasing position in the mines market. Since 1958, around 3 million antitank mines, models DM-11 were manufactured in Liebenau under licence of the Swedish company LIAB. Moreover, in collaboration with Bölkow and Dornier, Dynamit Nobel participated to the research projects of the Ministry of nuclear energy (today known as the Federal Ministry of education and research) for the possible supply of Germany with missiles.During the end of the 1950s, Friedrich Karl Flick, who was {{a board member of the}} supervisory board before the war, started to monopolise the company to the detriment of the minority shareholders, sometimes by brutal means. Supported by the Bremen speculator Hermann Krages and partly due to the <b>collusive</b> trading of <b>actions</b> with the Feldmühle AG of which Flick was also a shareholder, he managed to obtain the majority of the shares of the company and became the president of the board of directors. As from then, Flick who already possessed 82% of the share capital, made use of the controversial Umwandlungssteuergesetzes (fiscal law regarding commercial companies) in order to squeeze out the minority shareholders of the company, in exchange of a compensation (this tool is comparable to the one used today in order to exclude minority shareholders out of a company). After several groups of shareholders protested against this law put into place under the third Reich, the Federal Constitutional Tribunal gave a judgement in favour of Flick.|$|R
