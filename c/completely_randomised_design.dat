The muscle pHf and muscle lightness (L*) revealed a significant reduction, with increased energy intake. However, the increased energy intake had no effect on the chemical composition (moisture, protein, fat, and ash content) of the meat.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the application of expert systems techniques in the field of statistics. An expert statistician in industry has a twofold role; undertaking the design and analysis of data from complex experiments and providing supervision and help for research workers who analyse data from simpler designs. There is, therefore, a potential role for a statistical expert system which could be used by research workers to enable them to carry out valid analyses. The expert statistician would be freed from the more straightforward analyses and would only need to deal with referrals from the system and to initially 'tune' the system to their own application area. The design and development of such a prototype expert system, THESEUS, is the basis of this work. The area of application chosen for the prototype system is <b>completely</b> <b>randomised</b> <b>designs</b> with one trial factor. It was initially important to limit the area of study so that knowledge acquisition for the system would be a manageable task. However, once the difficulties in developing an expert system have been tackled, much of the expertise used in analysing this simple type of study could be readily extended to more complex designs. The knowledge acquisition phase, the most time consuming part of developing any expert system, concentrated on developing a rational prototype rule base by reviewing the available literature, interviewing practising statisticians and undertaking workshops where the analysis of particular data sets was discussed. The prototype software is a production rule system and is written in Turbo Pascal on an IBM-AT. Pascal was chosen because of the need to access statistical routines during the consultation process. The prototype uses a combination of forward and backward chaining to process the rules. Information required by the system can come from the user, the data or the rules. The overall system design also includes facilities for entering and editing data, altering and adding knowledge and a report generator. Implementation of these facilities is not incorporated as part of this thesis. A small number of trial sites were selected for industrial trials in order to validate the system and evaluate the results of the local experts 'tuning' of the rule base to their own particular application area...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{determine}} if photosynthesis interferes with the modulation of antioxidant compounds in young Euterpe oleracea plants exposed to water deficiencies. A factorial, <b>completely</b> <b>randomised</b> experimental <b>design</b> was employed, and two water conditions (water deficit and control) and four evaluation points (0, 6, 12 and 18 days) were used, {{resulting in a total}} of eight measurements. The measured parameters included the water content and temperature of the leaf, gas exchange, electrolyte leakage, and antioxidant content. Compared to the control treatment, the net loss of photosynthesis due to water restriction increased by approximately 100 % on the 18 th day of drought. The ascorbate levels decreased due to water restriction, presenting significant differences on the 12 th and 18 th day. In some cases, the water deficit increased the glutathione content; however, significant effects were only observed on the 18 th day after irrigation suspension. Water deficits had a negative impact on stomatal conductance, net photosynthesis rate, transpiration rate, and instantaneous carboxylation efficiency. Additionally, increases in the glutathione content, electrolyte leakage, and malondialdehyde content were observed; however, the ascorbate content decreased. Our results confirmed that the rate of photosynthesis interfered with the modulation of ascorbate and glutathione in young Euterpe oleracea plants exposed to drought...|$|R
