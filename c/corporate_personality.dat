In other words, Eazel sought to switch a groundswell of users from Macintosh and Windows to a new and immature system that free software users would want to pay for.

40|$|Corporate brands in today’s {{business}} landscape {{are complex}} and multifaceted, with employees playing {{a critical role in}} the building of those brands. As employee brand commitment forms an important part of building a corporate brand, it would be beneficial to understand the drivers of employee brand commitment in order to better understand the corporate brand. One of the main aspects of employee brand commitment is the <b>personality</b> of the <b>corporate</b> employer brand. This research aims to determine the relationship between <b>corporate</b> brand <b>personality</b> and employee brand commitment. By utilising the <b>Corporate</b> Brand <b>Personality</b> Scale and employee brand commitment measures, a quantitative survey was administered to 250 members of an online research panel. Exploratory factor analysis was used to determine the most common elements of the <b>Corporate</b> Brand <b>Personality</b> Scale. Thereafter, regression analysis was performed to determine the role of brand personality in predicting an employee’s commitment to their corporate brand. The results of this study show that factors of <b>corporate</b> brand <b>personality</b> have a significant influence on employee brand commitment. Further discussion into factor analysis shows that progressive and steadfast personality traits have a significantly positive effect on employee brand commitment, whilst supercilious personality traits {{have a negative effect on}} employee brand commitment.

Concepts of brand <b>personality,</b> <b>corporate</b> brand <b>personality,</b> and leadership personality are examined and later compared through the use of five major personality dimensions to uncover any connections between the entities. The case studies illustrate that an actual person, in conjunction with a brand identity, can effectively personify a brand.
