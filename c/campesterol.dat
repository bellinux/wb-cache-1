2500|$|Poppy {{seeds are}} notable for being {{especially}} high in tocopherols other than vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol). [...] Poppyseed oil from one source {{has been reported}} to contain 30.9mg gamma-tocopherol per 100 g. [...] It also contains alpha and gamma tocotrienols, but not others. [...] Compared to other vegetable oils, poppyseed oil has a moderate amount of phytosterols: [...] higher than soybean oil and peanut oil, lower than safflower oil, sesame oil, wheat germ oil, corn oil, and rice bran oil. [...] Sterols in poppyseed oil consist almost entirely of <b>campesterol,</b> stigmasterol, sitosterol and delta 5-avenasterol. [...] Poppyseed oil is high in linoleic acid. Although not generally higher than safflower oil, it can be as high as 74.5%. [...] Other triglycerides present in notable quantities are oleic acid and palmitic acid.|$|E
50|$|By {{removing}} carbon 242, <b>campesterol</b> is obtained.|$|E
50|$|<b>Campesterol</b> is a {{phytosterol}} whose {{chemical structure}} {{is similar to}} that of cholesterol.|$|E
50|$|Many vegetables, fruits, nuts, {{and seeds}} contain <b>campesterol,</b> but in low concentrations. Banana, pomegranate, pepper, coffee, grapefruit, cucumber, onion, oat, potato, and lemon grass (citronella) are few {{examples}} of common sources containing <b>campesterol</b> at roughly 1-7 mg/100 g of the edible portion. In contrast, canola and corn oils contain as much as 16-100 mg/100 g. Levels are variable and are influenced by geography and growing environment. In addition, different strains have different levels of plant sterols. A number of new genetic strains are currently being engineered {{with the goal of}} producing varieties high in <b>campesterol</b> and other plant sterols. It is also found in dandelion coffee.|$|E
50|$|Being a steroid, <b>campesterol</b> is a {{precursor}} of anabolic steroid boldenone. Boldenone undecylenate {{is commonly used}} in veterinary medicine to induce growth in cattle, {{but it is also}} one of the most commonly abused anabolic steroids in sports. This led to suspicion that some athletes testing positive on boldenone undecylenate did not actually abuse the hormone itself, but consumed food rich in <b>campesterol</b> or similar phytosteroids.|$|E
50|$|The {{tuberous}} {{roots of}} Butea superba {{were found to}} contain flavonoids and flavonoid glycosides as well as sterol compounds, including β-sitosterol, <b>campesterol</b> and stigmasterol.|$|E
50|$|Serum {{levels of}} <b>campesterol</b> and {{the ratio of}} <b>campesterol</b> to {{cholesterol}} have been proposed as measures of cardiac risk. Some {{studies have suggested that}} higher levels predict lower cardiac risk. However, extremely high levels are thought to be indicative of higher risk, as indicated by genetic disorders such as sitosterolemia. Study results of serum levels have been conflicting. A recent meta-analysis suggests that no clear relationship exists, and that perhaps previous studies have been confounded by other factors. For example, people who have a higher <b>campesterol</b> level related to a diet high in fruits and nuts may be consuming a Mediterranean-style diet, thus have lower risk because of other lipids or lifestyle factors. Intestinal absorption of cholesterol varies between individuals, and a higher absorption of plant sterols possibly is related to a higher absorption of LDL.|$|E
50|$|Brassicasterol {{is formed}} in plants from the isoprenoid {{squalene}} through <b>campesterol</b> as an intermediate. A {{list of the}} algae in which brassicasterol has been identified is shown below together with approximate composition.|$|E
50|$|Plant sterols {{were first}} {{shown in the}} 1950s to be {{beneficial}} in lowering LDLs and cholesterol. Since then, numerous studies have also reported the beneficial effects of the dietary intake of phytosterols, including <b>campesterol.</b>|$|E

50|$|Grape {{seed oil}} also {{contains}} 0.8 to 1.5% unsaponifiables rich in phenols (tocopherols) and steroids (<b>campesterol,</b> beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol). Grapeseed oil contains {{small amounts of}} vitamin E, but safflower oil, cottonseed oil, or rice bran oil contain greater amounts. Grapeseed oil is high in polyunsaturates and low in saturated fat.|$|E
50|$|Sterols {{of plants}} are called {{phytosterols}} and sterols of animals are called zoosterols. The most important zoosterol is cholesterol; notable phytosterols include <b>campesterol,</b> sitosterol, and stigmasterol. Ergosterol is a sterol {{present in the}} cell membrane of fungi, where it serves a role similar to cholesterol in animal cells.|$|E
50|$|Eugenol composes 72-90% of the {{essential}} oil extracted from cloves and is the compound most responsible for clove aroma. Other important essential oil constituents of clove oil include acetyl eugenol, beta-caryophyllene and vanillin, crategolic acid, tannins such as bicornin, gallotannic acid, methyl salicylate (painkiller), the flavonoids eugenin, kaempferol, rhamnetin, and eugenitin, triterpenoids such as oleanolic acid, stigmasterol, and <b>campesterol</b> and several sesquiterpenes.|$|E
50|$|Azadirachtin is {{the most}} well known and studied triterpenoid in neem oil. The {{azadirachtin}} content of neem oil varies from 300ppm to over 2500ppm depending on the extraction technology {{and quality of the}} neem seeds crushed. Nimbin is another triterpenoid which has been credited with some of neem oil's properties as an antiseptic, , antipyretic and antihistamine. Neem oil also contains several sterols, including (<b>campesterol,</b> beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>campesterol</b> {{molecules}} {{are thought}} to compete with cholesterol, thus reducing the absorption of cholesterol in the human intestine. [...] Plant sterols may also act directly on intestinal cells and affect transporter proteins. In addition, {{an effect on the}} synthesis of cholesterol-transporting proteins may occur in the liver cells through processes including cholesterol esterification and lipoprotein assembly, cholesterol synthesis, and apolipoprotein (apo) B100-containing lipoprotein removal.|$|E
5000|$|Sitosterolemia (also {{known as}} [...] "Phytosterolemia") {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} recessively inherited lipid metabolic disorder. It is characterized by hyperabsorption and decreased biliary excretion of dietary sterols (including the plant phytosterol beta-sitosterol). Healthy persons absorb only about 5% of dietary plant sterols, but sitosterolemia patients absorb 15% to 60% of ingested sitosterol without excreting much into the bile. The phytosterol <b>campesterol</b> is more readily absorbed than sitosterol.|$|E
50|$|Calcium, {{magnesium}} {{and iron}} {{are the main}} minerals of the roots. Minor amounts of zinc, manganese and copper have also been found.Tatakin (4-methoxyisoscutellargin), takakin 8-O-glucoside, takakin 7-O-glucoside, sesamin, chrysophanol, emodin, parietin, bucegin 7-O-glucoside, isoscutellarein, isoscutellarein 7-O-glucoside, methoxsalen, aesculetin, estrone, scopoletin, phytosterols (a mixture of β-sitosterol, stigmasterol and <b>campesterol)</b> and α-amyrin were extracted from G. bruguieri.

50|$|According to {{nutrient}} analyses by the USDA, a 100 g {{serving of}} Cape gooseberries {{is low in}} calories (53 kcal) and contains moderate levels of vitamin C, thiamin and niacin, while other nutrients are negligible (see table). Analyses of oil from different berry components, primarily its seeds, showed that linoleic acid and oleic acid were the main fatty acids, beta-sitosterol and <b>campesterol</b> as principal phytosterols, and the oil contained vitamin K and beta-carotene.|$|E
50|$|The {{intake of}} {{naturally}} occurring phytosterols ranges between ~200-300 mg/day depending on eating habits. Specially designed vegetarian experimental diets {{have been produced}} yielding upwards of 700 mg/day. The most commonly occurring phytosterols in the human diet are β-sitosterol, <b>campesterol</b> and stigmasterol, which account for about 65%, 30% and 3% of diet contents, respectively. The most common plant stanols in the human diet are sitostanol and campestanol, which combined make up about 5% of dietary phytosterol.|$|E
50|$|Although {{studies in}} humans {{have shown that}} {{consumption}} of phytosterols may reduce LDL levels, evidence to recommend them {{as a treatment for}} hypercholesterolemia is insufficient. Larger trials are needed to provide such evidence, and are underway. Animal studies have shown that <b>campesterol</b> and other phytosterols can reduce the size of atherogenic plaques, but no data yet show that consumption of phytosterols results in any clinical benefit such as a reduction in atherosclerosis, heart disease, cardiac events, or mortality.|$|E
5000|$|Sitosterolemia may share several {{clinical}} characteristics {{with the}} well-characterized familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), {{such as the}} development of tendon xanthomas in the first 10 years {{of life and the}} development of premature atherosclerosis [...] However, in contrast to FH patients, sitosterolemia patients usually have normal to moderately elevated total sterol levels and very high levels of plant sterols (sitosterol, <b>campesterol,</b> stigmasterol, avenosterol) and 5α-saturated stanols in their plasma. Plasma sitosterol levels in sitosterolemia patients are 10-25 times higher than in normal individuals (8-60 mg/dl). Not all patients with sitosterolemia have tendon xanthomas, thus absence of this should not be used to exclude this diagnosis.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{chemical}} compounds have been isolated from M. pachycarpa including several prenylflavonoids, dihydroflanonols, and chalconoids from the seed, rotenoids such as rotenone, cis-12a-hydroxyretenone, rot-2′-enonic acid and cis-12a-hydroxyrot-2′-enonic acid from the root, and barbigerone. [...] Several chemical analyses have yielded {{a number of}} novel prenylated isoflavones including erysenegalensein E, euchrenone b10, isoerysenegalensein E, 6,8-diprenylorobol, furowanin A and B, millewanins F, G and H, warangalone, and auriculasin from the leaves. The major flavonoid component of the stem {{was found to be}} auriculasin (6). In addition, terpenoids such as epifriedinol and friedelin, and steroids (phytosterols) such as <b>campesterol,</b> β-sitosterol and stigmasterol are also identified from the stem and leaf.|$|E
50|$|The almond is a nutritionally dense food (see chart pictured right) and a 100 gram {{amount is}} a rich source (>20% of the Daily value, DV) of the B {{vitamins}} riboflavin and niacin, vitamin E, and the essential minerals calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, and zinc. The same amount {{is also a good}} source (10-19% DV) of the B vitamins thiamine, vitamin B6, and folate; choline; and the essential mineral potassium. They are also rich in dietary fiber, monounsaturated fats, and polyunsaturated fats, fats which potentially may lower LDL cholesterol. Typical of nuts and seeds, almonds also contain phytosterols such as beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, <b>campesterol,</b> sitostanol, and campestanol, which have been associated with cholesterol-lowering properties.|$|E
50|$|The BR is biosynthesised from <b>campesterol.</b> The biosynthetic pathway was elucidated by Japanese {{researchers}} and later {{shown to be}} correct through the analysis of BR biosynthesis mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana, tomatoes, and peas. The sites for BR synthesis in plants have not been experimentally demonstrated. One well-supported hypothesis is that all tissues produce BRs, since BR biosynthetic and signal transduction genes are expressed {{in a wide range}} of plant organs, and short distance activity of the hormones also supports this. Experiments have shown that long distance transport is possible and that flow is in an acropetal direction, but it is not known if this movement is biologically relevant. Brassinosteroids are recognized at the cell membrane, although they are membrane-soluble.|$|E
50|$|F. sporotrichioides {{produces}} the mycotoxins neosolaniol, nivalenol, NT-1 toxin, NT-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, and T-2 toxin, {{all of which}} are trichothecenes. NT-1 and NT-2 toxins are inhibitors of protein synthesis, whilst nivalenol is a skin irritant and emetic, and can cause bone marrow degeneration. T-2 toxin is associated with skin necrosis in mammals, as well as causing intestinal damage and acting as an emetic in trout and birds, respectively. Other mycotoxins produced by F. sporotrichioides include butenolide, which causes mitochondrial damage in mammals and interferes with chlorophyll retention in plants, and moniliformin, which inhibits the citric acid cycle and consequently the breakdown of carbohydrates. Nontoxic secondary metabolites of F. sporotrichioides include various sterols, such as ergosterol (an important cell membrane constituent), <b>campesterol,</b> and sitosterol.|$|E

40|$|<b>Campesterol</b> is an {{important}} precursor for many sterol drugs, e. g. progesterone and hydrocortisone. In order to produce <b>campesterol</b> in Yarrowia lipolytica, C- 22 desaturase encoding gene ERG 5 was disrupted and the heterologous 7 -dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR 7) encoding gene was constitutively expressed. The codon-optimized DHCR 7 from Rallus norvegicus, Oryza saliva and Xenapus laevis were explored and the strain with the gene DHCR 7 from X. laevis achieved the highest titer of <b>campesterol</b> due to D 409 in substrate binding sites. In presence of glucose as the carbon source, higher biomass conversion yield and product yield were achieved in shake flask compared to that using glycerol and sunflower seed oil. Nevertheless, better cell growth rate was observed in medium with sunflower seed oil as the sole carbon source. Through high cell density fed-batch fermentation under carbon source restriction strategy, a titer of 453 ± 24. 7 mg/L <b>campesterol</b> was achieved with sunflower seed oil as the carbon source, which is the highest reported microbial titer known.

40|$|Previously, we {{have shown}} that the Arabidopsis det 2 (deetiolated 2) mutant is {{defective}} in the biosynthesis of brassinosteroids (BR) and that DET 2 (a steroid 5 α-reductase) acts early in the proposed BR biosynthetic pathway. In this paper we present further biochemical characterization of det 2. We have undertaken metabolic experiments with 2 H-labeled substrates of intermediates involved in the formation of campestanol from <b>campesterol,</b> and quantitative analysis of intermediates in Arabidopsis wild type and det 2. The results of these studies indicate the early operating steps of BR biosynthesis as: <b>campesterol</b> → 4 -en- 3 β-ol → 4 -en- 3 -one → 3 -one → campestanol in Arabidopsis, with det 2 deficient in the conversion of 4 -en- 3 -one to 3 -one. We have also detected these intermediates in the formation of campestanol from <b>campesterol</b> and their metabolic conversions using cultured cells of Catharanthus roseus. These studies confirmed the biosynthetic sequence of events from <b>campesterol</b> to campestanol as was found in Arabidopsis. As such, the originally proposed biosynthetic pathway should be modified...|$|E
40|$|Plant sterols such as {{sitosterol}} and <b>campesterol</b> {{are frequently}} administered as cholesterol-lowering supplements in food. Recently, {{it has been}} shown in mice that, in contrast to the structurally related cholesterol, circulating plant sterols can enter the brain. We questioned whether the accumulation of plant sterols in murine brain is reversible. After being fed a plant sterol ester-enriched diet for 6 weeks, C 57 BL/ 6 NCrl mice displayed significantly increased concentrations of plant sterols in serum, liver, and brain by 2 - to 3 -fold. Blocking intestinal sterol uptake for the next 6 months while feeding the mice with a plant stanol ester-enriched diet resulted in strongly decreased plant sterol levels in serum and liver, without affecting brain plant sterol levels. Relative to plasma concentrations, brain levels of <b>campesterol</b> were higher than sitosterol, suggesting that <b>campesterol</b> traverses the blood-brain barrier more efficiently. In vitro experiments with brain endothelial cell cultures showed that <b>campesterol</b> crossed the blood-brain barrier more efficiently than sitosterol.

40|$|Background—Phytosterols in {{soybean oil}} (SO) lipids likely {{contribute}} to parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD) in infants. No characterization of phytosterol metabolism {{has been done}} in infants receiving SO lipids. Methods—In a prospective cohort study, 45 neonates (36 SO lipid vs 9 control) underwent serial blood sample measurements of sitosterol, <b>campesterol,</b> and stigmasterol. Mathematical modeling was used to determine pharmacokinetic parameters of phytosterol metabolism and phytosterol exposure. Results—Compared to controls, SO lipid-exposed infants had significantly higher levels of sitosterol and <b>campesterol</b> (p< 0. 01). During SO lipid infusion, sitosterol and <b>campesterol</b> reached half of steady-state plasma levels within 1. 5 days and 0. 8 days, respectively. Steady-state level was highest for sitosterol (1. 68 mg/dL), followed by <b>campesterol</b> (0. 98 mg/dL), and lowest for stigmasterol (0. 01 mg/dL). Infants born < 28 weeks gestational age had higher sitosterol steady-state levels (p= 0. 03) and higher area under the curve for sitosterol (p= 0. 03) during the first 5 days of SO lipid (AUC 5) than infants born ≥ 28 weeks gestational age.
