40|$|We {{develop and}} compare two hydraulically-based schemes of the xylem {{structure}} {{of an individual}} plant. The dynamics of water uptake are analyzed under random conditions through the modeling of rainfall as a stochastic process. The two hydraulic schemes differ in the modeling of the root ability to cooperate, i. e., the capacity of roots to increase the water uptake from the wetter soil layers when {{other parts of the}} soil are dry (compensation effect) and to transfer water from moister into drier soil layers (water redistribution effect). Both <b>compensation</b> and <b>water</b> redistribution are direct consequences of the hydraulic structure of the root system, which is modeled here considering two contrasting cases corresponding to non-interacting uptake paths from different soil layers, and converging uptake paths. Only the latter hydraulic architecture allows for <b>compensation</b> and <b>water</b> redistribution. Another important difference between the hydraulic schemes is the stomatal response to soil dryness. When the soil water is unevenly distributed in the soil layers, the differences in the hydraulic schemes emerge. In semi-arid climates, plants characterized by a cooperative root system are shown to be less prone to water stress. In contrast, plants with non-interacting roots result to be better fit to humid climates, where the probability of droughts is smal...|$|R

40|$|Root {{water uptake}} by plants mediates the {{exchange}} of water, carbon and energy between land surface and atmosphere and is important in hydrological, climatological, agricultural and ecological studies. Field measurements show that root water uptake could be significantly affected by root <b>water</b> <b>compensation</b> and hydraulic redistribution. We thus use a root water uptake model able to describe these two mechanisms and show their importance when vegetation is growing in shallow water-table environments or duplex soils. The model {{is based on the}} Richards equation for the water-flow in soils, with a term for root water uptake being a function of the water potential difference between root xylem and the soil. We describe the flow in the xylem using the Darcy's equation. The model is used in three studies aimed at highlighting the role that root <b>water</b> <b>compensation</b> and hydraulic redistribution might have on the overall root water uptake. In the first study, the model in one dimension is applied to a site near Sydney, Australia, to investigate how native trees growing on duplex soils are able to sustain transpiration rate despite long periods with little or no rain. The model was able to reproduce sap-flux data and the pattern of soil, root and leaf water potential for several months. Scenarios with different root depths showed that trees were able to adjust their water-uptake rates from different soil layers based on soil moisture availability; thus, root <b>water</b> <b>compensation</b> appears to be a key mechanism to maintain sustained transpiration rates. In a second study we investigated the contribution of root <b>water</b> <b>compensation</b> and hydraulic redistribution to root water uptake in shallow water-table environments. We compared the results of our model with a more commonly used root water uptake model. In the third study, we extended the 1 D-model to two dimensions, thereby being able to simulate horizontal hydraulic redistribution and the interaction between species with different root systems. In the 2 D-model, the roots were assumed to be a continuum in soil and the root systems were described in terms of xylem conductivity fields. Scenarios are presented to show that the 2 D-model is able to reproduce observed flow patterns through roots in parts of the soil with different degrees of moisture. The studies presented in this thesis show the further development and use of a modeling approach that is gaining increasing interest in the recent literature. These studies present a realistic description of the role that root <b>water</b> <b>compensation</b> and hydraulic redistribution play in plant water use. The 2 D-model introduces a representation of the root system that allows for modelling vertical (hydraulic lift) and horizontal hydraulic redistribution of water in soil, and an efficient description of the interaction between species with different root systems...|$|R

The upper reservoirs supply the drinking water, while Vale House and Bottoms are compensation reservoirs which guarantee the flow of water to water-powered mills downstream. Valehouse, with a crest elevation of 503 m, is too low to supply water under gravity to the Mottram tunnel, so could not be used as an impounding reservoir.

40|$|Niche {{differentiation}} {{is a major}} hypothesized {{determinant of}} species distributions, but its practical importance is heavily debated and its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Trait-based approaches {{have been used to}} infer niche differentiation and predict species distributions. For understanding underlying mechanisms, individual traits should be scaled up to whole-plant performance, which has rarely been done. We measured seven key traits that are important for carbon and water balance for 37 tropical tree species. We used a process-based plant physiological model to simulate the carbon budget of saplings along gradients of light and water availability, and quantified the performance of the species in terms of their light compensation points (a proxy for shade tolerance), <b>water</b> <b>compensation</b> points (proxy for drought tolerance), and maximum carbon gain rates (proxy for potential growth rate). We linked species performances to their observed distributions (the realized niches) at two spatial scales in Bolivian lowland forests: along a canopy openness gradient at local scale (~ 1 km 2) and along a rainfall gradient (1100 – 2200 mm/yr) at regional (~ 1000 km) scale. We show that the <b>water</b> <b>compensation</b> point was the best predictor of species distributions along water and light resource gradients within and across tropical forests. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the stomatal regulation of minimum leaf water potentials, rather than stem hydraulic traits (sapwood area and specific conductivity), contributed to the species differences in the <b>water</b> <b>compensation</b> point of saplings. The light compensation point and maximum carbon gain, both driven by leaf area index and leaf nitrogen concentration, also contributed to differential species distributions at the local scale, but not or only marginally at the regional scale. Trait-and-physiology-based simulations of whole-plant performance thus help to evaluate the possible roles of individual traits in physiological processes underlying species performance along environmental gradients. The development of such whole-plant concepts will improve our ability to understand responses of plant communities to shifts in resource availability and stress under global change...|$|R

The gatehouse for the tunnel at Loch Errochty is near the southern shore, the actual intake is beneath it at the bottom of the loch. The power station has a maximum output of 75 MW and is the largest power producer of the nine main stations in the Tummel scheme.
