40|$|A criança, durante a hospitalização, passa por diferentes situações de estresse devido aos procedimentos invasivos, sendo o cateterismo venoso periférico (CVP) um dos procedimentos mais realizados pelos profissionais de enfermagem. Neste sentido, vale ressaltar a importância da inclusão do {{familiar}} no processo de cuidar da sua criança com CVP no cotidiano de uma enfermaria pediátrica, buscando amenizar as situações difíceis e estressantes decorrentes desse procedimento no processo de hospitalização. Deste modo, o estudo tem como objeto a interação entre o enfermeiro-familiar no cuidado à criança com CVP, com os objetivos de identificar as ações de enfermagem realizadas no cuidado à criança com CVP e analisar a interação entre o enfermeiro-familiar dessa criança na ótica do enfermeiro. Trata-se de um estudo com delineamento na abordagem qualitativa, cujo cenário foi um hospital pediátrico, localizado no município do Rio de Janeiro. A coleta de dados deu-se por meio de entrevista não diretiva, gravada com dezoito (18) enfermeiros lotados em unidades de internação em que o familiar estivesse presente integralmente e que atuam ou atuaram no cuidado à criança com CVP. As falas foram submetidas à análise de conteúdo e das entrevistas emergiram duas (02) categorias: Dinâmica do cuidado à criança com CVP e as respectivas subcategorias: Ações de enfermagem que envolve a colocação e manutenção de CVP e Inclusão do familiar no cuidado de enfermagem à criança com CVP; e Processos de interação enfermeiro-familiar no cuidado de enfermagem à criança com CVP. O estudo retratou como o enfermeiro realiza o cuidado à criança com CVP e faz a inclusão do seu familiar durante a realização desse procedimento no cotidiano de um hospital pediátrico. Proporcionou, também, o conhecimento dos aspectos que envolvem as ações de enfermagem à criança com CVP demonstrando que essas possuem dimensões de cuidados que vão além dos aspectos biológico. Para tanto, o profissional de enfermagem deve envidar esforços para que, além da realização dos cuidados técnicos necessários, atue como facilitador da experiência de hospitalização para a criança e sua família, valorizando sua individualidade, direitos e valores. Esta deve acontecer desde o momento que chegam ao hospital para que proporcionem o acolhimento deste binômio, fazendo com que se sintam importantes neste cenário. Assim, como sugestões para as equipes de enfermagem, apontamos que sejam promovidas capacitações voltadas para a abordagem da família, sistematização da assistência e o estabelecimento de parcerias com as universidades para troca de experiências. Sugerimos, também, que sejam criados espaços para encontros sistematizados com os familiares das crianças hospitalizadas para discutir e refletir sobre aspectos emergentes do cotidiano que foram suscitados neste estudo, com o intuito de amenizar e otimizar este momento difícil e de crise para a criança e a família. Assim, o enfermeiro como agente de educação deve, a partir das interações dialógicas, desenvolver um plano de atuação voltado ao atendimento das necessidades da criança com CVP e sua família acerca das dificuldades, medos, anseios gerados pela expectativa desse cuidado. The child, {{during the}} hospitalization, goes by different stress situations {{due to the}} invasive procedures, being the peripheral veined catheterism (PVC) one of the procedures more accomplished by nursing professionals. In this sense, it is worth {{to point out the}} importance of the relative's inclusion in the process of taking care of your child with PVC in the daily of a pediatric infirmary, looking for to soften difficult and stressful situations current of that procedure in the hospitalization process. In this way, the study has as object the interaction among nurse-family in the care to the child with PVC, with the objectives of identifying the nursing actions accomplished in the care to the child with PVC and to analyzes the interaction among the nurse-family of that child in the nurse optics. It is treated of a study with design in qualitative approach, whose scenery was a pediatric hospital, located in the municipal district of Rio de Janeiro. The collection of data felt through interview non directing, recorded with eighteen (18) nurses located in units of internment in that the relative was integrally present and that act or acted in the care to the child with PVC. The speeches were submitted to content analysis and from interviews emerged two (02) categories: "Dynamics of care to the child with PVC" and the respective subcategories: "Nursing actions that involves the placement and maintenance of PVC and The relative's inclusion in the nursing care to the child with PVC" and "Processes of interaction nurse-family in the nursing care to the child with PVC". The study portrayed as the nurse accomplishes the care to the child with PVC and the child relative's inclusion during the accomplishment of that procedure in the daily of a pediatric hospital. The study provided, also, knowledge of aspects that involves nursing actions to the child with PVC demonstrating that those possess dimensions of cares surpass besides the biological aspects. For so much, nursing professional should endeavor efforts so that, besides the accomplishment of the necessary technical <b>cares,</b> <b>act</b> as facilitator of the hospitalization experience for the child and your family, valuing your individuality, rights and values. This should happen since the moment that arrive at the hospital so that they provide the reception of this binomial, making they feel important in this scenery. In this way, as suggestions for the nursing teams, we point promotion of trainings focused on the approach of the family, together in a system of the attendance and the establishment of partnerships with universities for a change of experiences. We suggested, also, that spaces are created for encounters systematized with the children's relatives hospitalized to discuss and to contemplate on emergent aspects of the daily that they were raised in this study, with intention of soften and optimize this difficult moment and of crisis for the child and the family. In this way, the nurse as education agent owes starting from the dialogical interactions, to develop a plan of performance returned to the attendance of the child's needs with PVC and your family concerning the difficulties, fears, longings generated by the expectation of that care...|$|E
