40|$|This paper {{presents}} a modelling approach for predicting the internal dynamic behaviour of ball bearings under high moment loads. This type of loading {{is a specific}} feature of helicopter main gear boxes because of special design rules and the high structural flexibility of such systems. The ball bearing model proposed here {{is not limited to}} planar systems and incorporates several different phenomena such as contact deformation, elastohydrodynamic <b>contact,</b> internal <b>clearance</b> and cage run-out. The cage–race interaction is treated as a hybrid short journal model, which ensures continuity of the contact force at the transition from the hydrodynamic to metal-to-metal regime. In the dynamic analysis of such a severely loaded bearing, the dependence of the shaft-to-inner-ring force on inner race position cannot be neglected. An equivalent viscoelastic hinge joint has been developed, it produces an additional force that represents the overall rigidity of the system. The stiffness parameters of the joint are identified using global finite element simulations. A ball bearing loaded with two different moments is chosen as an example. Relevant results concerning the internal dynamic behaviour are given. The predicted cage trajectory has been compared to experimental observations, and good agreement has been found...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} {{tangential}} friction at pin—hole interfaces are appropriately modelled {{for the analysis}} of fasteners in large composite (orthotropic) plate loaded along its edges. The pin—hole contact could be of interference, clearance or neat fit. When the plate load is monotonically increased, interference fits give rise to receding <b>contact,</b> whereas <b>clearance</b> fits result in advancing contact. In either case, the changing contact situations lead to non-linear moving boundary value problems. The neat fit comes out as a special case in which the contact and separation regions are invariant with the applied load level and so the problem remains linear. The description of boundary conditions in the presence of tangential friction, will depend on whether the problem is one of advancing or receding contact, advancing contact presenting a special problem. A model is developed for the limiting case of a rigid pin and an ideally rough interface (infinitely large friction coefficient). The non-linearity resulting from the continuously varying proportions of contact and separation at the interface, is handled by an “Inverse Formulation” which was successfully applied earlier by the authors for smooth (zero friction) interfacial conditions.

40|$|Debris {{created during}} the wear of {{prosthetic}} joints {{is known to}} {{have an effect on the}} success of the implant. As such the factors affecting wear and lubrication need to be understood in order to reduce wear as much as possible in vivo. In this thesis a number of orthopaedic biomaterials were tested in vitro, and various factors affecting their tribology were investigated. Load was found to affect wear for stainless steel on UHMWPE contacts, but not the wear factor which has a load term incorporated into it. Increasing nominal contact stress, however, was found to cause a decrease in wear factor particularly at low values of contact stress. The wear factor was less affected at higher values of <b>contact</b> stress. <b>Clearance</b> and roughness were both seen to affect the lubrication mode under which ceramic-on-ceramic joints operated, as noted by extensive friction testing. Lower clearances and lower roughnesses respectively promoted fluid film lubrication. The wear remained very low in both cases and was undetectable gravimetrically. However, changes in the surface morphology throughout testing supported the fact that some wear did occur, but that this was so small as to be beyond the detection limits of the experiment. This is encouraging for the longevity of these joints in vivo. The "running-in" phenomenon seen in metal-on-metal combinations was investigated using large diameter metal-on-metal resurfacing prostheses. During the course of wear testing the initially higher wear rate dropped to a much lower steady state wear.

A three dimensional multibody dynamic model is established, including gravity, bending moments, fluctuating mesh stiffness, nonlinear tooth <b>contact,</b> and bearing <b>clearance.</b> A flexible main shaft, planetary carrier, housing, and gear shafts are modeled using reduced degrees-of-freedom through modal compensation. This drivetrain model is validated against the experimental data of Gearbox Reliability Collaborative for gearbox internal loads. Planet load sharing is a combined effect of gravity, bending moment, bearing clearance, and input torque. Influences {{of each of}} these parameters and their combined effects on the resulting planet load sharing are investigated. Bending moments and gravity induce fundamental excitations in the rotating carrier frame, which can increase gearbox internal loads and disturb load sharing. Clearance in carrier bearings reduces the bearing load carrying capacity and thus the bending moment from the rotor can be transmitted into gear meshes. With bearing clearance, the bending moment can cause tooth micropitting and can induce planet bearing fatigue, leading to reduced gearbox life.

Design Feasibility study. Setting Gait laboratory and community use. Participants Participants (N= 7) with diagnosis of unilateral foot-drop of central neurologic origin (> 6 mo) who were regular users of a foot-drop FES system (> 3 mo). Intervention Array-based automated setup FES system for foot-drop (ShefStim). Main Outcome Measures Logged usage, logged automated setup times for the array-based automated setup FES system and diary recording of problems experienced, all collected in the community environment. Walking speed, ankle angles at initial <b>contact,</b> foot <b>clearance</b> during swing, and the Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology version 2. 0 (QUEST version 2. 0) questionnaire, all collected in the gait laboratory. Results All participants {{were able to use}} the array-based automated setup FES system. Total setup time took longer than participants' own FES systems, and automated setup time was longer than in a previous study of a similar system. Some problems were experienced, but overall, participants were as satisfied with this system as their own FES system. The increase in walking speed (N= 7) relative to no stimulation was comparable between both systems, and appropriate ankle angles at initial contact (N= 7) and foot clearance during swing (n= 5) were greater with the array-based automated setup FES system.

Following ovalbumin challenge AT 7519 was administered systemically at the peak of pleural inflammation and inflammatory cell infiltrate, apoptosis and evidence of macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic eosinophils assessed at appropriate time points. Administration of AT 7519 dramatically enhanced the resolution of allergic pleurisy via direct induction of eosinophil apoptosis without detriment to macrophage clearance of these cells. This enhanced resolution of inflammation was shown to be caspase-dependent as the effects of AT 7519 were reduced by treatment with a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor (z-vad-fmk). Our data show that AT 7519 induces human eosinophil apoptosis and enhances the resolution of a murine model of allergic pleurisy by inducing caspase-dependent eosinophil apoptosis and enhancing macrophage ingestion of apoptotic eosinophils.

The dynamics behaviors of a rigid rotor system are studied through the bifurcation, the Poincarè maps, the spectrum diagrams and the axis orbit of responses of the system.

Investigators at the Langley Research Center focused attention on the structural behavior of the field joints with O-ring seals in the steel solid rocket booster (SRB) cases. The shell-of-revolution computer program BOSOR 4 was used to model the aft field joint of the solid rocket booster case. The shell model consisted of the SRB wall and joint geometry present during the Shuttle 51 -L flight. A parametric study of the joint was performed on the geometry, including joint <b>clearances,</b> <b>contact</b> between the joint components, and on the loads, induced and applied. In addition combinations of geometry and loads were evaluated. The analytical results from the parametric study showed that contact between the joint components was a primary contributor to allowing hot gases to blow by the O-rings. Based upon understanding the original joint behavior, various proposed joint modifications are shown and analyzed in order to provide additional insight and information. Finally, experimental results from a hydro-static pressurization of a test rocket booster case to study joint motion are presented and verified analytically...|$|R
