25|$|A peptide {{pheromone}} quorum sensing {{signaling system}} in S. mutans includes the Competence Stimulating Peptide (CSP) that controls genetic competence. Genetic competence {{is the ability}} of a cell to take up DNA released by another cell. Competence can lead to genetic transformation, a form of sexual interaction, favored under conditions of high cell density and/or stress where there is maximal opportunity for interaction between the <b>competent</b> <b>cell</b> and the DNA released from nearby donor cells. This system is optimally expressed when S. mutans cells reside in an actively growing biofilm. Biofilm grown S. mutans cells are genetically transformed at a rate 10- to 600-fold higher than S. mutans growing as free-floating planktonic cells suspended in liquid.|$|E
50|$|Error prone PCR {{utilizes}} {{the fact}} that Taq DNA polymerase lacks 3' to 5' exonuclease activity. This results in an error rate of 0.001-0.002% per nucleotide per replication. This method begins with choosing the gene, or the area within a gene, one wishes to mutate. Next, the extent of error required is calculated based upon the type and extent of activity one wishes to generate. This extent of error determines the error prone PCR strategy to be employed. Following PCR, the genes are cloned into a plasmid and introduced to <b>competent</b> <b>cell</b> systems. These cells are then screened for desired traits. Plasmids are then isolated for colonies which show improved traits, and are then used as templates {{the next round of}} mutagenesis. Error prone PCR shows biases for certain mutations relative to others. Such as biases for transitions over transversions.|$|E
50|$|The first {{breakthroughs}} in ProTide research {{was made in}} 1992, when the McGuigan's group noted the efficacy of aryloxy phosphates and phosphoramidates. In particular, diaryl phosphates were prepared from zidovudine (AZT) using simple phosphorochloridate chemistry. For the first time, the anti-HIV activity of these phosphate derivatives of AZT exceeded that of the parent nucleoside in some cases. Moreover, while AZT was almost inactive (EC50 100µM) in the JM cell line, the substituted diaryl phosphate was 10-times more active (EC50 10µM). At the time, it was considered that JM was AZT-insensitive due to poor phosphorylation. It later emerged that an AZT-efflux pump {{was the source of}} this poor AZT sensitivity. However, the conclusion remains valid that the diaryl phosphate was more able to retain activity in the JM cell line, and that this may imply a (small) degree of intracellular phosphate delivery. The electron-withdrawing power of the p-nitro groups and putative enhancements in aryl leaving group ability were suggested as the major driving force of this SAR.Subsequently, a series of aryloxy phosphoramidates of AZT was prepared with various p-aryl substituents and several aminoacids. Compounds were only studied in the AZT-resistant JM cell line to probe potential (implied) AZT-monophosphate release, and the alanine phosphoramidate emerged as strikingly effective. In HIV-1 infected JM all cultures, AZT was inhibitory at 100µM, while the phenyl methoxy alaninyl phosphoramidate was active at 0.8µM. This was taken as the first evidence of a successful nucleotide delivery. It was also noted that in other series there was a marked preference for alanine over leucine (10-fold) and glycine (>100-fold). Moreover, while electron-withdrawing aryl substitution had been noted to be very effective in the diaryl systems, it was detrimental here. Para fluoro substitution had a slight adventitious effect, but not significantly so, while para-nitro substitution led to a 100-fold loss of activity. In a subsequent studies the range of aryl substituents was extended and compounds studied in true TK+ (thymidine kinase competent) and TK- (thymidine kinase deficient) cell lines. None of the phosphoramidates retained the high (2-4 nM) potency of AZT in TK <b>competent</b> <b>cell</b> lines (CEM and MT-4) against either HIV-1 or HIV-2. However, while AZT lost all of its activity in the TK- deficient cell line CEM/TK-, most of the phosphoramidates retained antiviral activity, thus being ca >10-35-fold more active than AZT in this assay. Again, alanine emerged as an important component, with the glycine analogue being inactive in HIV-infected CEM/TK- all cultures. In this assay, leucine and phenylalanine were as effective as alanine, although they were less so in CEM/TK+ assays. Thus, the parent phenyl methoxy alanyl phosphoramidate emerged as an important lead compound.Stavudine (d4T) was an early application of the ProTide approach. This was a rational choice based on the known kinetics of phosphorylation of d4T. Thus, while the second phosphorylation (AZT-monophosphate to AZT-diphosphate) but not the first phosphorylation (AZT to AZT-monophosphate) is regarded as rate limiting for AZT activation to the triphosphate, the first step (d4T to d4T monophosphate) is thought in general to be the slow step for d4T. Thus, an intracellular (mono)nucleotide delivery should have maximal impact for d4T and similar nucleosides. In the first instance (halo)alkyloxy phosphoramidates of d4T were prepared and found to retain activity in d4T-resistant JM cells. The activity was dependent on the haloalkyl group; the parent propyl system being poorly active. Subsequent studies in HIV-infected CEM/TK- cell cultures revealed the aryloxy phosphoramidates of d4T to be highly effective and, notably, to retain their full activity in CEM/TK- cells. In this study the benzyl ester emerged as slightly more potent than the parent methyl compound, being almost 10-times more active than d4T in CEM/TK+ assays and thus ca 300-500 fold more active than d4T, in CEM/TK- assays.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the prime}} {{problems}} of immunology today deals with {{the potential of the}} immune <b>competent</b> <b>cell</b> to produce antibody of a given specificity. In studying this problem, we are faced with three principal possibilities: (a) The <b>competent</b> <b>cell</b> has a limited amount of information in its genome which confers upon it the ability to synthesize antibody to one or a very few antigenic determinants (1 - 5). (b) The cell competent to produce antibody is omniscient; that is, its genome codes for all necessary sequences observed in the varied antibody response of the organism (6, 7). (c) The immune <b>competent</b> <b>cell</b> does not possess in its genome any information for specific antibody, and the specificity is conferred in an "instructional " manner, at a higher (transcription, translation, etc.) level (8).

After formation, competent cells were no longer sensitive to the above agents. Methicillin and an inhibitor of chromosomal replication, hydroxyphenylazouracil, did not inhibit the development of competence.

40|$|Pineal gland {{melatonin}} is {{the darkness}} hormone, while extra-pineal melatonin {{produced by the}} gonads, gut, retina, and immune <b>competent</b> <b>cells</b> acts as a paracrine or autocrine mediator. The well-known immunomodulatory effect of melatonin is observed either as an endocrine, a paracrine or an autocrine response. In mammals, nuclear translocation of nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) blocks noradrenaline-induced melatonin synthesis in pinealocytes, which induces melatonin synthesis in macrophages. In addition, melatonin reduces NF-κB activation in pinealocytes and immune <b>competent</b> <b>cells.</b> Therefore, pathogen- or danger-associated molecular patterns transiently switch the synthesis of melatonin from pinealocytes to immune <b>competent</b> <b>cells,</b> and as the response progresses melatonin inhibition of NF-κB activity leads these cells to a more quiescent state.

Pretreatment of the walls with either sodium dodecylsulfate, deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease, or with crude competence-provoking factor {{did not affect the}} binding of DNA. Antiserum prepared against whole competent cells completely blocked transformation and also inhibited DNA binding to <b>competent</b> <b>cell</b> walls. Adsorption of this antiserum with competent Challis cells removed its blocking action for both binding and transformation.

Many methods currently employed for the storing of microorganisms require highly specialized storage systems; substantial technical equipment; know-how and temperature controlled environments. Whilst these methods are effective, it is accepted that they can be expensive and technically demanding. Traditionally, methods ofevaluating novel storage techniques require the use of classical bacterial enumeration techniques, which are slow, labour intensive and expensive to automate. This work investigates the use of in-vivo bacterial bioluminescence as an alternative bacterial enumeration tool to aid the identification of novel preservatives and preservation formats for the quantitative and qualitative preservation of bacteria. The development of a cheap, simple, yet effective storage alternative to current preservation systems based on a novel self-drying concept, containing activated charcoal and sucrose protectant is reported. In addition, the evaluation of DNA transformed bacteria using plasmids containing lux gene cassettes was studied in order to assess transformation efficiencies in competent cells. Currently, competent cells are distributed and stored at very low temperatures in order to maintain their viability and competence, therefore, the demand for a technology that will alleviate the need for handling and storing of competent cells at sub-zero temperaturesÃ‚Â· is certainly present.
