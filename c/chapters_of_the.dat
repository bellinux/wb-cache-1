It has three movements: the large central movement is surrounded by two much shorter ones.

5|$|In November 2009 Cameron {{and others}} {{distributed}} free copies of an altered version of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species {{on college campuses}} in the United States. The book consisted of Darwin's text with <b>chapters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book removed, and with an added introduction by Ray Comfort reiterating common creationist assertions about Darwin and evolution. The book was criticized by scientists and Darwin biographers who criticized the omission of key <b>chapters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book, and who stated that its introduction contains misinformation about Darwin, and long-refuted creationist arguments about the science of evolution, such as the linking of Nazi racial theories to Darwinist ideas. Comfort later said that the four chapters were chosen at random to be omitted {{in order to make}} the book small enough to be affordable as a giveaway, with the absent chapters available for download, but that the missing chapters were included in the second edition, which had a smaller text size that made printing the entire book as a giveaway affordable. The second edition still lacks Darwin's preface and glossary of terms. The National Center for Science Education arranged a campaign to distribute an analysis of the Comfort introduction and a banana bookmark at colleges across the U.S., a reference to Comfort's presentation of the banana as an argument for the existence of God.|$|E
