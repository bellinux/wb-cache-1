40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the interaction between}} internal market rules, {{and in particular the}} freedom of circulation of goods, on one side, and the national cultural policies of Member States, on the other side. The goal is to show how the EC/EU interindividual legal system tends to extend its realm in areas of the law that would appear, at first sight, to be excluded from its scope of application. Culture is a good example thereof. While this might happen, {{in a number of areas}} of cultural action, without impinging upon the sovereignties of its Member States, the present article addresses some cases where this extension has the potential of restricting the capability of Member States to pursue their cultural policy aims. Two examples are analysed. First, the abolition of physical controls on goods <b>crossing</b> <b>internal</b> <b>borders</b> is scrutinized, together with the legislation adopted to ensure that goods pertaining to national cultural heritage, which are unlawfully removed from the territory of one Member State, be given back to it. The initial approach followed by Directive 93 / 7 is compared with the recent Directive 2014 / 60, and it is shown that, while the former imposed a (partially) uniform approach to the definition of national cultural heritage, thus essentially depriving art. 36 TFEU provision of its effet utile in the field, the latter restores a correct relationship between internal market and national cultural policies. More than just that: the 2014 Directive approach is understood as the only way to really respect fundamental principles of the EU legal system such as democracy, openness, subsidiarity, sincere cooperation, and proportionality. Second, the reach of the prohibition of measures equal to quantitative restrictions in the field of book prices’ policies is taken into account. The article shows how the ECJ case law in this field obstructs the efforts of Member States to promote a coherent policy of promotion of “culture-intensive” publishing, and one of widespread presence of culturally active and specialized bookstores. The relevant case law is analysed as an example of an out-dated approach, that fails to reconcile different but concurring raisons d’être of the EU project, and is no longer tenable in light of the overall features of the EC/EU interindividual legal system...|$|E

As {{the vast majority of}} migrant people landing in Italy targets destinations in Central and Northern European States, they avoid filing permits applications in Italy and rather try a northwards land journey.|$|R
40|$|Biofouling {{of vessels}} is implicated {{as a high}} risk {{transfer}} mechanism of non-indigenous marine species (NIMS). Biofouling on international vessels is managed through stringent border control policies, however, domestic biofouling transfers are managed under different policies and legislative arrangements as they <b>cross</b> <b>internal</b> <b>borders.</b> As comprehensive guidelines are developed and increased compliance of international vessels with ‘clean hull’ expectations increase, vessel movements from port to port will {{become the focus of}} biosecurity management. A semiquantitative port to port biofouling risk assessment is presented that evaluates the presence of known NIMS in the source port and determines the likelihood of transfer based on the NIMS association with biofouling and environmental match between source and receiving ports. This risk assessment method was used to assess the risk profile of a single dredge vessel during three anticipated voyages within Australia, resulting in negligible to low risk outcomes. This finding is contrasted with expectations in the literature, specifically those that suggest slow moving vessels pose a high to extreme risk of transferring NIMS species...|$|R

40|$|Service-learning {{initiatives}} often {{serve as}} higher education’s approach to achieving institutional goals of fostering students’ civic growth. Alternative Spring Breaks (ASBs), defined {{in this study}} as short-term immersion trips developed to engage college students in direct service experiences, have been understudied as service-learning programmatic options in higher education, thus leaving little to no indication of {{the larger context of}} the service experience, nor its participant outcomes in terms of civic engagement (Jones, Robbins, & LePeau, 2011). This study addresses gaps in researcher and practitioner understanding of ASBs, by uncovering long-term effects of these widely utilized, yet under-researched programs. Through a narrative inquiry methodology, this study captures the stories of five alternative spring break participants from a mid-sized suburban private institution which organizes two domestic ASBs yearly. The respondent narratives speak to service-learning’s ability to not only engage students in cross-cultural experiences, but to also <b>cross</b> <b>internal</b> <b>borders</b> within themselves, challenging pre-conceived notions of otherness and social issues. This study highlights the aesthetic and emotive meaning participants ascribe to their service experience long-term, noting shifts in their civic mindfulness and cultural sensitivity as well as propensity to civically engage post- graduation. By studying students’ experiences with border-crossing, challenging pre-conceived notions of difference, and individual civic responsibility development, this study unpacks the alternative spring break participant perspective shift and development experience. Through the use of Dewey’s philosophy of education and Giroux’s theory of border-crossing, this study sheds light on the blind spots of service-learning, specifically ASBs, generating critique of the pedagogy in the hope of advancing the field, and ultimately the experience for future alternative spring break participants...|$|R
5000|$|The Bosnian Police {{consists}} of thirteen sub-state territorial police forces and two specialist state-level police forces. The two main police bodies in Bosnia and Herzeogvina {{are governed by}} the Directorate for Coordination of Police Bodies of Bosnia and Herzegovina. [...] Each of the two entities, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska has their own police force. In the latter, this is a central force covering the whole entity, in the former a specialist force covering specific crimes and those crimes that <b>cross</b> <b>internal,</b> Cantonal, <b>borders.</b> In the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, there are ten Cantonal police forces, each under a Cantonal Ministry of the Interior. The District of Brčko, in Northeast Bosnia, also has its own police force. At {{the level of the}} central state, Bosnia and Herzegovina also has a police agency focused on Counter Terrorism, Organised Crime and crime crossing international borders, the State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA), and a State Border Service. Although agreement was reached on unifying the police forces, much like the armies were unified, it has yet to be realised.|$|R
40|$|Large-scale {{migration}} {{constitutes an}} unavoidable social reality within the European Union. A European polity {{is made possible}} and tangible by the individual acts of migrants <b>crossing</b> the <b>internal</b> <b>borders,</b> developing a transnational life and integrating into European societies. Consequently, migration has become a special feature of the self-understanding of the European Union: its existence depends upon a continuing flow of persons crossing {{the borders of the}} Member States, and also upon the management of the flows of third-country nationals knocking at its doors. To respond to this challenge, the Union has developed common European migration policies. This book is a collection of essays which aim to explore a selected number of issues related to the development of these policies. It presents the current state, and the future of European immigration law discussing the political rationales and legal competences driving the action of the Union in this area. It reflects on the cooperation of the Union with third countries and on the emergence of international migration legal norms. It illustrates the role of the European Courts and the emergence of new actors through the adoption of EU instruments. (Publisher's abstract...|$|R

Rather, political pressures on maintaining a free movement area without <b>internal</b> <b>border</b> controls seem as high as they were {{at the height of the}} 2015 ‘refugee crisis’. Because of the sustained unwillingness of some member states to lift <b>internal</b> <b>border</b> controls, the EU’s policies on Schengen are strongly dominated by intergovernmental interests, reviving memories of the system’s early days outside the EU legal system. A new Commission proposal on modifying the Schengen Borders Code (SBC), presented with the subtitle “Preserving and Strengthening Schengen”, appears to be more about preserving Schengen in the face of an antagonistic political climate rather than strengthening its essence, i. e., an area without <b>internal</b> <b>border</b> control...|$|R

40|$|The {{borders of}} Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) today {{are the result}} of a complex process {{conducted}} decades after the fall of communist regimes in this part of Europe. With the opening towards the west, with the change of political and economic regimes came the implementation of democratic reforms of CEE societies and this led to the beginning of a complex integration process. The latter is undoubtedly associated with profound changes in the form and role of borders between states and the new Western partners. The old barriers open, the borders become increasingly soft. Old movement restrictions are removed. The main idea of the integration process is not to settle barriers, but to attenuate them. From this perspective, <b>internal</b> <b>borders</b> become more and more inclusive and less visible. Security and border traffic control are transferred to external borders that become more and more exclusive, more restrictive if we respect the logic above. Such a theory is valid up to a point. <b>Internal</b> <b>borders</b> do not simply become more open, more inclusive; there is an integration process taking place in steps. The EU external border greatly expanded eastward, and in this context the old borders have become simple <b>internal</b> <b>borders.</b> Associated to an integration process, we find a process of dilution to the disappearance of <b>internal</b> <b>borders</b> with the Schengen space integration (old borders remain expressions of sovereignty, the national limits no longer serve to separate people, goods and capital). ...|$|R
40|$|Through {{examination}} {{of the dynamics of}} the U. S. -Mexico border in the anti-immigration discourse as compared with those found in ethnographies on immigrants' experiences in the United States, the author found that an understanding of the symbol of the border and its implications is key to comprehending the conflicting relationships between the ideologies of anti-immigration movements and those of immigrants. Throughout the history of the United States, anti-immigration movements have constructed <b>internal</b> <b>borders</b> which define outsiders and insiders, or those who belong and are accepted in the• country and those who are not. Nevertheless, as the composition of the immigrant population has changed throughout the years, so have the <b>internal</b> <b>borders.</b> They are constantly adjusted to include some groups and to keep out others. However, anti-immigration groups set up constructions of the border as absolute, unchanging, and fixed. This vision of the physical border as absolute contributes to the strict <b>internal</b> <b>borders</b> that are constructed by the anti-immigration movement. An analysis of this movement's discourse is essential to understanding how the border is made to appear natural and fixed...|$|R

40|$|CONTEXT: Ischemic lesions in {{patients}} with internal carotid artery (ICA) steno-occlusive disease can be categorized {{on the basis of}} their location and presumed cause: external <b>border</b> zone infarcts, <b>internal</b> <b>border</b> zone infarcts, cortical infarcts, lacunar infarcts, and periventricular lesions. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between the prevalence and size of ischemic lesions and cerebral vasomotor reactivity {{in patients}} with unilateral occlusion of the ICA. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Referral center. PATIENTS: Seventy consecutive patients were included in this study. All patients had a transient or minor disabling retinal or cerebral ischemia that was associated with unilateral occlusion of the ICA. Ischemic lesions on magnetic resonance imaging were identified on hard copies, and volume measurements were obtained by a magnetic resonance workstation. Vasomotor reactivity was assessed with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography with carbon dioxide challenge. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence and size of ischemic lesions. RESULTS: In the hemisphere ipsilateral to the ICA occlusion, we found an increased prevalence of <b>internal</b> <b>border</b> zone infarcts (P =. 01), external borders zone infarcts (P<. 001), and territorial infarcts (P =. 02) compared with the contralateral hemisphere. Hemispheres with a carbon dioxide reactivity less than or equal to 18 % demonstrated a significant increase in prevalence (P =. 007) and volume (P =. 003) of <b>internal</b> <b>border</b> zone infarcts compared with hemispheres with a carbon dioxide reactivity greater than or equal to 19 %. No association between carbon dioxide reactivity and any other type of ischemic lesion was found. CONCLUSION: In patients with an ICA occlusion, only <b>internal</b> <b>border</b> zone infarcts demonstrate a significant association with diminished cerebral hemodynamics...|$|R
