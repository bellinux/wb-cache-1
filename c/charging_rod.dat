Electrical contact regions (110, 120) are arranged electrically separate from each other. The contact regions are designed to electro-conductively contact the wafer stacks laid in the cartridge in an inserted condition and to connect rear and front sides of the wafer stacks with respective potentials. A <b>charging</b> <b>rod</b> connects the contact regions with a voltage source via conductors. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for collectively operating multiple wafer stacks. USE - Wafer cartridge device for receiving wafer stacks of a microelectronic product during thinning a rear side of wafers for applying a metalization layer on the rear side of the wafers. ADVANTAGE - The device efficiently and reliably handles the wafer stacks. The contact regions are designed to electro-conductively contact the wafer stacks laid in the cartridge in the inserted condition, thus activating and/or retaining electrostatic holding force of the device even in high temperature and continuously refreshing a charging condition of a portable electrostatic carrier during handling temperature of the wafer stacks...|$|E

40|$|Micron-sized {{colloidal}} spheres {{that are}} dispersed in an isotropic-nematic biphasic host suspension of <b>charged</b> <b>rods</b> (fd-virus particles) are shown to spontaneously form dimers, which exhibit a synchronized oscillatory motion. Dimer formation is not {{observed in the}} monophase of isotropic and nematic suspensions. The synchronized oscillations of dimers {{are connected to the}} inhomogeneous state of the host suspension of <b>charged</b> <b>rods</b> (fd viruses) where nematic domains are in coexistence with isotropic regions. The synchronization of oscillations occurs in bulk states, {{in the absence of an}} external field. With a low field strength of an applied electric field, the synchronization is rather reduced, but it recovers again when the field is turned off. In this Rapid Communication, we report this observation as an example of the strange attractor, occurring in the mixture of PS (polystyrene) dimers in an isotropic-nematic coexistence biphasic fd-virus network. Furthermore, we highlight that the synchronization of PS-dimer oscillations is the result of a global bifurcation diagram, driven by a delicate balance between the short-attractive “twisted” interaction of PS dimers and long-ranged electrostatic repulsive interactions of <b>charged</b> fd <b>rods.</b> The interest is then in the local enhancement of “twist-nematic” elasticity in reorientation of the dimer oscillations. An analysis of image-time correlations is provided with the data movies and Fourier transforms of averaged orientations for the synchronized oscillations of dimers in the biphasic I−N coexistence concentration of charged fd-virus suspensions...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{diffusion}} behavior of dilute solutions of {{very long and}} thin, <b>charged</b> colloidal <b>rods</b> (fd-virus particles) is studied by a holographic grating technique. The Soret coefficient of the charged colloids is measured {{as a function of}} the Debye screening length, as well as the rod-concentration. The Soret coefficient of the fd-viruses increases monotonically with increasing Debye length, while there is a relatively weak dependence on the rod-concentration when the ionic strength is kept constant. An existing theory for {{thermal diffusion}} of charged spheres is extended to describe the thermal diffusion of long and thin <b>charged</b> <b>rods,</b> leading to an expression for the Soret coefficient in terms of the Debye length, the rod-core dimensions, and the surface charge density. The thermal diffusion coefficient of a <b>charged</b> colloidal <b>rod</b> is shown to be accurately represented, for arbitrary Debye lengths, by a superposition of spherical beads with the same diameter of the rod and the same surface charge density.

40|$|We present {{experimental}} {{measurements of}} the cholesteric-smectic phase transition of suspensions of <b>charged</b> semiflexible <b>rods</b> {{as a function of}} rod flexibility and surface <b>charge.</b> The <b>rod</b> particles consist of the bacteriophage M 13 and closely related mutants, which are structurally identical to this virus, but vary either in contour length and therefore ratio of persistence length to contour length, or vary in surface charge. Surface charge is altered in two ways; by changing solution pH and by comparing M 13 with fd virus, a mutant which differs from M 13 only by the substitution of a single charged amino acid for a neutral one per viral coat protein. Phase diagrams are measured as a function of particle length, particle charge and ionic strength. The experimental results are compared with existing theoretical predictions for the phase behavior of flexible <b>rods</b> and <b>charged</b> <b>rods.</b> In contrast to the isotropic-cholesteric transition, where theory and experiment agree at high ionic strength, the nematic-smectic transition exhibits complex charge and ionic strength dependence significantly different from predicted phase behavior.

40|$|In {{one and two}} {{component}} solvents, we {{calculate the}} counterion distribution around a <b>charged</b> <b>rod</b> treating the degree of ionization α as an annealed variable dependent on its local environment. In the one component case, α is determined under various conditions without and with salt. In the two component case, we {{take into account the}} preferential solvation of the counterions and the ionized monomers and the short-range interaction between the rod and the solvent without salt. It then follows a composition-dependent mass action law. Mesoscopic variations of the composition and the counterions are produced around a chraged rod, which sensitively depend on various parameters of the molecular interactions. Furthermore, we predict a first order phase transition of weak-to-strong dissociation for strong preferential solvation. It can occur in expanded states of a polymer chain. This transition line starts from a point on the solvent coexistence curve and ends at a critical point in the plane of the temperature and the solvent composition. The composition change around a <b>charged</b> <b>rod</b> is long-ranged near the solvent critical point. Comment: 17 pages, 15 figures. submitted to J. Chem. Phy...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: We study semidilute and {{concentrated}} solutions of mononucleosomal DNA at three different NaCl concentrations by static and dynamic light scattering, viscosity, and electron cryomicroscopy. At low enough DNA concentrations the {{second virial coefficient}} behaves in the usual manner and can be interpreted by a <b>charged</b> <b>rod</b> model. It is possible to understand the concentration and scattering vector dependence of the scattering {{with the help of}} recent theoretical analyses of semidilute solutions of <b>charged</b> <b>rods.</b> Moreover, the mutual friction coefficient is in accord with the theory of hydrodynamic screening. At a certain critical concentration which increases with added salt, the intensity of the equilibrium static scattering increases several 100 -fold, indicating the DNA aggregates. The dynamic scattering is in line with the static scattering; a very long decay time seems {{to be associated with the}} DNA aggregates. Freeze electron micrographs definitely bear out the existence of DNA globules which appear to form loose aggregates. Precautions have been taken to ensure there are no spurious contaminants to the best of our knowledge.

40|$|Abstract. The {{statistical}} mechanics of a dense fluid of <b>charged</b> <b>rods</b> is considered, {{and the corresponding}} phase diagram is calculated, using a collective coordinate transformation. A first-order isotropic-nematic phase transition is found, as suggested by a recent experiment. Collective coordinate transformations {{have been widely used}} in many different areas of physics. A well known example where they arise naturally is in the study of lattice vibrations, where such a transformation yields phonons. Some other fields where these transformations occur are plasma physics (Pines and Bohm 1952) and polymer physics (Edwards 1966). In general, they are useful for systems at high density with long-range interactions present. In this Letter we report on a new application of collective coordinates, namely to the {{statistical mechanics}} of a <b>charged</b> <b>rod</b> fluid. This is of interest for two reasons. Firstly our method is valid in the high-density limit where the rods are highly overlapping. This is the case that presents the greatest difficulty because the low-density limit can be dealt with correctly (in the mean field approximation) by using the virial expansion (Onsager 1949). Secondly, it is interesting because of an experi-ment on DNA persistence length fragments at high concentration (Brian et a 1 1981) ...|$|R
