Over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> he filmed three shorts starring Hoyle and Ryder, in which they explored some of the scenarios and themes that made it into Uncle David. In these shorts Hoyle wore a wig and makeup, which were omitted from the later feature.

5|$|For {{the first}} few hours after the mudflow hit, she was covered by {{concrete}} but got her hand {{through a crack in}} the debris. After a rescuer noticed her hand protruding from a pile of debris, he and others cleared tiles and wood over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> Once the girl was freed from the waist up, her rescuers attempted to pull her out, but found the task impossible without breaking her legs in the process. Each time a person pulled her, the water pooled around her, rising so that it seemed she would drown if they let her go, so rescue workers placed a tire around her body to keep her afloat. Divers discovered that Sánchez's legs were caught under a door made of bricks, with her aunt's arms clutched tightly around her legs and feet.|$|E
5|$|The {{extremely}} {{short distance}} of the eyewall of Hurricane Danny from a Doppler radar station in Mobile, Alabama and its slow landfall over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> led to further study by meteorologists. The proximity to land allowed for measurements at a level closer to the surface than {{it is possible for}} hurricane reconnaissance aircraft to achieve, with the slow landfall allowing for more extended observation. One conclusion of the study included the need to sample the boundaries of an eyewall more to establish a better estimate of surface-level winds and the overall intensity of a storm. Another conclusion was that while Danny's slow movement positioned it over a tidal estuary bordering the Gulf, maintaining of or increase in strength was possible since eyewall convection remained over waters with high sea surface temperatures and other environmental conditions remained favorable.|$|E

5|$|The sand whiting is a {{schooling}} species, whose {{movements are}} associated with a variety of factors including prey, lunar patterns and spawning movements; although there appears to be little consistency in its movements in relation to these factors. Studies on the species over the period of a year have shown the species does not change its local distribution over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> generally being of the same abundance during both night and day. Seasonal abundance due to spawning is variable, with studies conducted in Moreton Bay, Queensland finding the species recruits heavily to shallow waters and increase numbers during winter months, while studies in the Noosa River estuary have shown no difference in numbers recruited {{over the course of a}} season. Like other sillaginids, they have the ability to 'burrow' into the sand and remained hidden until a predator or seine net has passed by.|$|E

25|$|Light {{scattered}} {{in a blue}} sky forms a characteristic pattern of partially polarized light which {{is dependent on the}} position of the sun and invisible to human eyes. With a UV receptor in each of the lens units of a compound eye, and a UV filter oriented differently in each of these units, a bee is able to detect this polarization pattern. A small piece of blue sky is enough for a bee to recognize the pattern changes occurring over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> This provides not only directional but also temporal information.|$|E
25|$|Frisch {{proved that}} {{variations}} {{in the position of}} the sun over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> provided bees with an orientation tool. They use this capability to obtain information about the progression of the day deep inside a dark beehive comparable to what is known from the position of the sun. This makes it possible for the bees to convey always up-to-date directional information during their waggle dance, without having to make a comparison with the sun during long dance phases. This provides them not only with alternative directional information, but also with additional temporal information.|$|E

25|$|In {{the days}} leading up to the Japanese attack, patrols from the Australian 22nd Brigade were sent across the strait to Johor at night to gather intelligence. Three small patrols were sent on the evening of 6 February; one was spotted and withdrew after its leader was killed and their boat sunk, while two others managed to get ashore. Over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> they found large {{concentrations}} of troops, although they were unable to locate any landing craft. The Australians requested the shelling of these positions to disrupt the Japanese preparations, but the patrol reports were later ignored by Malaya Command as being insignificant, believing that the real assault would come in the north-eastern sector, not the north-west.|$|E
25|$|Wardell's {{conversion}} to the Roman Catholic faith {{was the result}} of a period of deep internal reflection. This affiliation to a more high church ritual was manifested in his architectural interests which concentrated on the more Gothic designs of England's medieval architecture. For the remainder of his life he saw architecture as a means of praising God. He always had a room in his home set aside as a chapel for personal devotion which he visited several times during the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> Dominating this room was an ancient carved wooden French cross that now belongs to the Melbourne Diocesan Historical Commission, who also own several other mementos of his persona devotion. Wardell also wrote, in particular two prayers devoted to the Virgin Mary, who he seems to have regarded as his especial saint. It is known that he frequently prayed for help and guidance when working on plans of church buildings.|$|E
25|$|Hyperbolas {{may be seen}} in many sundials. On {{any given}} day, the sun {{revolves}} in a circle on the celestial sphere, and its rays striking the point on a sundial traces out a cone of light. The intersection of this cone with the horizontal plane of the ground forms a conic section. At most populated latitudes and at most times of the year, this conic section is a hyperbola. In practical terms, the shadow of the tip of a pole traces out a hyperbola on the ground over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> (this path is called the declination line). The shape of this hyperbola varies with the geographical latitude and with the time of the year, since those factors affect the cone of the sun's rays relative to the horizon. The collection of such hyperbolas for a whole year at a given location was called a pelekinon by the Greeks, since it resembles a double-bladed axe.|$|E

500|$|Because of Oklahoma's {{position}} between {{zones of}} differing prevailing temperature and winds, weather patterns {{within the state}} can vary widely over relatively short distances and can change drastically in a short time.

This type of phenomenon is also responsible {{for many of the}} tornadoes in the area, such as the 1912 Oklahoma tornado outbreak, when a warm front traveled along a stalled cold front, resulting in an average of about one tornado per hour over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E

500|$|In his 1908 account on {{the early}} world of finance, Fifty Years in Wall Street, Henry Clews (who knew Little personally) penned that Little was [...] "generous and liberal to a fault with his brother speculators who had {{experienced}} misfortune...remarkable for his great memory, he could easily remember all the operations he made in the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> without making a note or a mistake," [...] and another stock market historian, Leonard Louis Levinson, {{said that he was}} [...] "a nervous perfectionist who personally attended to every detail...kind, magnanimous, honorable, and a genius in market maneuvers." [...] Having fallen into bankruptcy many times before, Little was a particularly sensitive debtor, and would often waive the debts held to him by others who fell on hard times; thus it came to be that, by the time of his death, Little was owed millions of dollars by others, of which only 150,000 was successfully collected by his friends and family, a modest sum given the size of his former wealth.|$|E

500|$|The {{story and}} the {{photographs}} circulated the Internet, including various cryptozoology blogs, with {{a great amount of}} speculation about possible explanations.

Comparisons were drawn to the Montauk Monster found in Montauk, New York in June 2008. A popular theory was that the Panama Creature was a sloth (perhaps an albino) that had somehow became hairless; proponents of the hypothesis cited the hooked claw visible in one of the photographs. Science author Darren Naish, writing for ScienceBlogs, supported the sloth hypothesis, but had a [...] "difficult time" [...] explaining the creature's hairlessness. The sloth theory was generally considered most credible; in 1996, similar photographs were taken of a creature found on the coast between Panama and Costa Rica that was later confirmed to be a sloth that had started to decay. Further Internet speculation led to some proposing that it was in fact a dolphin or a pit bull terrier, an example of a species previously unknown to science, or some sort of genetic mutation. Some Panamanian zoologists said that it appeared to be a fetus of some kind. In addition to naturalistic explanations, Billy Booth of About.com reported that [...] "there has been speculation that it is alien, and thereby the connection to UFOs, undersea bases, the whole ball of wax".|$|E
