40|$|Nail onychomycosis {{is still}} an {{important}} part of dermatological infectious diseases, with relatively low effectiveness of the therapy. Epidemiological research proved, that in last years the rate of onychomycosis is increasing and it is nowadays the most <b>common</b> <b>nail</b> disease. The main pathogens are dermatophytes less often yeasts and molds. So far three main treatment modalities are known: topical, general and combination therapy. Because of the unsatisfactory effectiveness of current drugs the research of new compounds is conducted. There is a growing interest in the treatment of onychomycosis with the photodynamic therapy, lasers and iontophoresis. New preparations for topical and systemic treatment are also under development.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The goals of this research were {{to gain a better understanding}} of the performance of ring-shank (annularly threaded) nails in lateral connections common to the post-frame industry, and to evaluate the European yield model (EYM), the basis for derivation of allowable design values, for ring-shank nails. Inputs to the EYM include nail bending yield strength, dowel bearing strength, and connection geometry. These parameters as well as single-shear connection strength were determined for nine nail groups tested in Southern Pine lumber. Nail specimens included three suppliers, two shank types (smooth and ringshank), two diameters (3. 76 and 4. 50 mm), and two coatings (galvanized and ungalvanized). Ring-shank nails averaged 85 % higher nail bending yield strength than the <b>common</b> <b>nails</b> for all but two groups. A regression model relating dowel bearing strength to specific gravity was developed based on tests with the nine nail groups loaded parallel-to-grain in Southern Pine. A statistically significant reduction in dowel bearing strength was observed for 4. 50 compared to 3. 76 mm diameter nails. While ring-shank nail connection maximum loads were roughly twice that of <b>common</b> <b>nails</b> for the same diameter, no significant differences were observed for yield loads. The current yield load definition is based on the slope of the initial portion of the load-displacement curve and does not adequately account for increases in connection strength resulting from higher steel quality. As a result, predicted yield loads based on the EYM were significantly higher than observed yield loads. A revised yield load definition is needed which includes yielding predicted by the EYM without including factors extraneous to the model. Ring-shank nails exhibited significantly higher lateral connection strengths than the <b>common</b> <b>nails</b> tested as a result of increased steel strength and gripping action of the threads. Finally, standardization in ringshank nail manufacturing must be instituted to ensure minimum steel and thread quality, before any increase in design values for ring-shank nails is implemented...|$|R

40|$|Background: Onychomycosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} <b>common</b> <b>nail</b> disorders. Mycological {{examination}} by potassium hydroxide (KOH) mount and fungal culture is the most commonly used diagnostic method. However, it is associated with a low sensitivity. Aims: To evaluate the technique of subungual hyperkeratosis nail biopsy in diagnosing onychomycosis in HIV-infected and immunocompetent adults and compare it with mycological examination. Methods: 34 HIV-positive patients who presented clinically with onychomycosis were recruited in the study from the beginning. There was no screening done for patients with onychomycosis. This has been clarified in manuscript under the heading of methods. Results: All the fungal cultures yielded dermatophytes correlating with the biopsy findings. Only hyphal form of fungus was detected in KOH examination, indicating it was not a contaminant. Clinical types of onychomycosis are stated in discussion. Conclusions: PAS stain of subungual hyperkeratosis nail biopsy was the most sensitive in the diagnosis of onychomycosis in both HIV-infected and non-infected groups...|$|E
