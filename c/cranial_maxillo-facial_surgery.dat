40|$|New Virtual Reality {{technologies}} {{provide the}} possibility of widening access to information in data. Haptics, the technology of touch, could be an interesting future aid and have large impact on medical applications. The use of haptic devices allows computer users to use their sense of touch, in order to feel virtual objects {{with a high degree}} of realism. The aim of the thesis is to investigate the potential deployment and the benefits of using haptic force feedback instruments in <b>maxillo-facial</b> <b>surgery.</b> Based on a produced test application, the thesis includes suggested recommendations for future haptic implementations. At the Department of <b>Maxillo-Facial</b> <b>Surgery,</b> at the Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm, Virtual Reality technologies are used as an aid to a limited extent during the production of physical medical models. The physical medical models are produced with Rapid Prototyping techniques. This process is examined and described in the thesis. Moreover, the future of the physical medical models is outlined, and a future alternative visualizing patient data in 3 D and use haptics as an interaction tool, is described. Furthermore, we have examined the present use of haptic technology in medicine, and the benefits of using the technology as an aid for diagnostic and treatment planning. Based on a presented literature study and an international outlook, we found that haptics could improve the management of medical models. The technology could be an aid, both for physical models as well as for virtual models. We found three different ways of implementing haptics in <b>maxillo-facial</b> <b>surgery.</b> A haptic system could be developed in order to only manage virtual medical models and be an alternative solution to the complete Rapid Prototyping process. A haptic system could serve as a software, handling the image processing and interfacing from a medical scanner to an Rapid Prototyping system. A haptic system could be developed as an alternative interaction tool, which could be implemented as an additional function in currently used image processing software, in order to improve the management of virtual medical models before the Rapid Prototyping process. An implementation for planning and examination in <b>maxillo-facial</b> <b>surgery,</b> using haptic force feedback interaction, is developed and evaluated. The test implementation is underlying our aim of investigating the potential deployment and the benefits of using haptic force feedback instruments in <b>maxillo-facial</b> <b>surgery.</b> After discussing the possible future of our implementation and the future of haptic force feedback in <b>maxillo-facial</b> <b>surgery,</b> a recommendation is given as a conclusion of our total work...|$|R

50|$|In 1939 an Emergency Hospital Service {{hospital}} {{was built on}} the Baguley site by Manchester Corporation. 17 pavilions were built, some of wood and some of brick, with a total capacity of 680 beds, reduced to 350 because of the specialist nature of some of the units. A plastic <b>surgery</b> and <b>maxillo-facial</b> <b>surgery</b> centre, with three thirty bedded wards, one for women, one for officers and one for other ranks, was established under the leadership of Professor F C Wilkinson. A dental laboratory was set up on a ward veranda. All the civilian TB patients were moved out. The first party of 10 patients came from Dunkirk on 3 June 1940 for <b>maxillo-facial</b> <b>surgery.</b> Patients included German prisoners of war. In 1943 a separate Dental unit and laboratory, a photography unit and two operating theatres were added. In early 1945 the hospital reverted to civilian use but with a military wing of 128 beds for servicemen with pulmonary TB. After the war it became difficult to find sufficient nurses and 120 beds were closed. The plastic <b>surgery</b> and <b>maxillo-facial</b> <b>surgery</b> centre continued and did some work at the Christie Hospital and at the Duchess of York Hospital.

40|$|Computed {{tomography}} is {{a medical}} instrument that can be useful not only for diagnostic purposes, but also for surgical planning, thanks {{to the fact that}} it offers volumetric information which can be translated in three dimensional models. These models can be visualized, but also exported to Rapid Prototyping (RP) systems, that can produce these structures thanks to the rapidity and versatility of the technologies involved. The literature reports various cases of stereolithographic models used in orthopedic, neurological, and <b>maxillo-facial</b> <b>surgery.</b> In these contexts, the availability of a copy of the real anatomy allows not only planning, but also the practical execution of surgical operations, within the limitations of the materials. Nevertheless, the Rapid Prototyping model also presents some disadvantages that can be reduced if practical simulation is accompanied by virtual simulation, performed on a digital model.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{validate}} {{a protocol}} for creating virtual models {{to be used}} in the construction of solid prototypes useful for the planning-simulation of <b>maxillo-facial</b> <b>surgery,</b> in particular for very complex anatomic and pathologic problems. To optimize communications between the radiology, engineering and surgical laboratories. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We studied 16 patients with different clinical problems of the maxillo-facial district. Exams were performed with multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and single slice computed tomography (SDCT) with axial scans and collimation of 0. 5 - 2 mm, and reconstruction interval of 1 mm. Subsequently we performed 2 D multiplanar reconstructions and 3 D volume-rendering reconstructions. We exported the DICOM images to the engineering laboratory, to recognize and isolate the bony structures by software. With these data the solid prototypes were generated using stereolitography. To date, surgery has been preformed on 12 patients after simulation of the procedure on the stereolithographyc model. RESULTS: The solid prototypes constructed in the difficult cases were sufficiently detailed despite problems related to the artefacts generated by dental fillings an d prostheses. In the remaining cases the MPR/ 3 D images were sufficiently detailed for surgical planning. The surgical results were excellent in all patients who underwent surgery, and the surgeons were satisfied with the improvement in quality and the reduction in time required for the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: MDCT enables rapid prototyping using solid replication, which was very helpful in <b>maxillo-facial</b> <b>surgery,</b> despite problems related to artifacts due to dental fillings and prosthesis within the acquisition field; solutions for this problem are work in progress.

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of in vivo microdialysis {{has made it}} possible to monitor cutaneous free flaps in <b>maxillo-facial</b> <b>surgery.</b> A microprobe inserted in the free flap dermis collects a microdialysate enabling measurement of dermal metabolites such as glucose, lactate, pyruvate, or glycerol. The monitoring curves are predictive of ischemia-related tissue injury. Hourly measurements provide a reliable method for early diagnosis of venous or arterial thrombosis. Revision surgery can then be undertaken if needed to repair microanastomoses before clinical alteration. This technique has been compared with validated flaps monitoring systems such as temperature probe, transcutaneous oxygen tension monitoring, and laser Doppler flowmetry. Microdialysis has several advantages: objective measurements, different curves for venous and arterial thrombosis, early diagnosis.
