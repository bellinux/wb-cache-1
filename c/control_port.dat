500|$|Following {{a request}} from Grant for {{assistance}} against Vicksburg, Banks finally laid siege to Port Hudson in May 1863. Two attempts to storm the works, as with Grant at Vicksburg, were dismal failures. The first, made against the entrenched enemy on May 27, failed because of inadequate reconnaissance and because Banks failed to ensure the attacks along the line were coordinated. [...] After a bloody repulse, Banks continued the siege, and launched a second assault on June 14. It was also badly coordinated, and the repulse was equally bloody: {{each of the two}} attacks resulted in more than 1,800 Union casualties. [...] The Confederate garrison under General Franklin Gardner surrendered on July 9, 1863, after receiving word that Vicksburg had fallen. [...] This brought the entire Mississippi River under Union <b>control.</b> <b>Port</b> Hudson was the first time African American soldiers were used in a major Civil War battle.|$|E
2500|$|The Mark 14 torpedo {{tended to}} run some [...] too deep for several reasons. The first {{was that it}} was tested with an {{exercise}} warhead that was more buoyant than the warhead; that was a precaution made to avoid losing an expensive torpedo. A light exercise head made the torpedo positively buoyant, so it would float to the surface {{at the end of its}} run. The live warhead contained more mass, so it reached equilibrium at a lower depth. Also, the depth mechanism was designed prior to the warhead's explosive charge being increased, making the torpedo even heavier overall. [...] "Testing conditions became more and more unrealistic, obscuring the effect of the heavier warhead on depth performance." [...] Furthermore, the depth testing device used by NTS to verify the torpedo's running depth (the depth and roll recorder) had the same measuring port placement error as the Mark 14's depth <b>control</b> <b>port,</b> so both were off by the same amount in the same direction and gave the impression that the torpedo was running at the desired depth when it was actually much deeper. After hearing of the deep-running torpedo problem, most submarine skippers simply set their torpedoes' running depth to zero, which risked broaching the torpedo.|$|E

5000|$|The CPU {{communicates}} {{with the}} VDC through an 8-bit bus. A pin {{controlled by the}} CPU separates this bus into two [...] "ports", a <b>control</b> <b>port</b> and a data port. To write or read a byte of video memory, the CPU first has to write two bytes on the VDC's <b>control</b> <b>port</b> to the VDC's internal address register. Next, the CPU performs the actual write or read on the VDC's data port. As a data byte is written or read, the TMS9918 automatically increments the internal address register. This auto-increment feature accelerates writes and reads of blocks of data. The <b>control</b> <b>port</b> {{is also used to}} access various internal registers.|$|E

5000|$|Also to {{be noted}} {{is the way}} in which boost control is achieved, {{depending}} on the type of wastegate used. Typically manual [...] "bleed type" [...] boost controllers are only used on swing type (single port) wastegate actuators. To increase boost, pressure is taken away from the actuator control line, therefore increasing boost. Dual port swing type wastegate actuators and external wastegates generally require electronic boost control although adjustable boost control can also be achieved on both of these with an air pressure regulator, this is not the same as a bleed type boost controller. To increase boost with an external or dual port wastegate, pressure is added to the top <b>control</b> <b>port</b> to increase boost. When boost control is not fitted, this <b>control</b> <b>port</b> is open to the atmosphere.|$|E
