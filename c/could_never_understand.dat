He also tried his hand at production, with three 15-minute travelogues: Terry-Thomas in Tuscany, Terry-Thomas in the South of France and Terry-Thomas in Northern Ireland. He did not enjoy the producer's role, complaining that [...] "for some extraordinary reason that I <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>understand,</b> everybody was always out to do the producer of any film whoever he was. I had to be on the watch the whole time". He worked consistently during 1963, appearing in television programmes {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic; these included Terry-Thomas, a one-off variety show on BBC Television in July that included Donald Sutherland.|$|E
500|$|When the Beatles {{recorded}} [...] "Twist and Shout", {{the final}} track during the mammoth one-day session {{that produced the}} band's 1963 debut album, Please Please Me, Lennon's voice, already compromised by a cold, came close to giving out. Lennon said, [...] "I couldn't sing the damn thing, I was just screaming." [...] In the words of biographer Barry Miles, [...] "Lennon simply shredded his vocal cords {{in the interests of}} rock 'n' roll." [...] The Beatles' producer, George Martin, tells how Lennon [...] "had an inborn dislike of his own voice which I <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>understand.</b> He was always saying to me: 'DO something with my voice!... put something on it... Make it different.'" [...] Martin obliged, often using double-tracking and other techniques.|$|E
500|$|The {{whole purpose}} of the [...] "invitation" [...] to Nick to attend a Gatsby party {{was to develop a}} {{relationship}} with him so that Gatsby could later ask Nick to arrange a reunion between himself and Daisy. Nick invites Daisy to have tea at his house without telling her that Gatsby will also be there. After an initially awkward reunion, Gatsby and Daisy reestablish their connection. They begin an affair and, after a short time, Tom grows increasingly suspicious of his wife's relationship with Gatsby. At a luncheon at the Buchanans' house, Daisy speaks to Gatsby with such undisguised intimacy that Tom realizes she is in love with Gatsby. Though Tom is himself involved in an extramarital affair, he is outraged by his wife's infidelity. He forces the group to drive into New York City and confronts Gatsby in a suite at the Plaza Hotel, asserting that he and Daisy have a history that Gatsby <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>understand.</b> In addition to that, he announces to his wife that Gatsby is a criminal whose fortune comes from bootlegging alcohol and other illegal activities. Daisy realizes that her allegiance is to Tom, and Tom contemptuously sends her back to East Egg with Gatsby, attempting to prove that Gatsby cannot hurt him.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the album}} is noted for its {{tranquil}} soundscapes, Graham Sutton of Bark Psychosis notes [...] "Noise is important.

2500|$|I {{could never}} analyse why, {{right from the}} outset, {{sections}} of the New Zealand crowds had taken a set against Greg. Perhaps it was his jaunty manner on the field. Perhaps he was a shade too successful for the liking of the more rabidly parochial Kiwi fans...You <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>understand</b> the mentality behind the crank phone calls Greg received in New Zealand, the egg-throwing and the incident in Wellington where a toilet seat was thrown on the field.|$|E
2500|$|On September 18, 1957, Blank, Grinich, Kleiner, Last, Moore, Noyce, Roberts and Hoerni {{resigned}} from Shockley Labs. They {{became known as}} the [...] "traitorous eight", though it is not known who coined the term. Shockley <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>understand</b> the reasons for this defection. After that time, he never talked to Noyce again, but continued to follow the work of [...] "The Eight". He also combed through all records left by The Eight, basing patents, held as Shockley Labs' intellectual property, on any important ideas. (Technically, in accordance with U.S. law, those patents were issued to the respective inventing employees.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Brazil's {{reaction}} to the invasion of Goa was one of staunch solidarity with Portugal, reflecting earlier statements by Brazilian presidents that their country stood firmly with Portugal {{anywhere in the world}} and that ties between Brazil and Portugal were built on ties of blood and sentiment. Former Brazilian President Juscelino Kubitschek, and long time friend and supporter of Portuguese PM Salazar, stated to Indian PM Nehru that [...] "Seventy Million Brazilians <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>understand,</b> nor accept, an act of violence against Goa." [...] In a speech in Rio de Janeiro on 10 June 1962, Brazilian congressman Gilberto Freyre commented on the invasion of Goa by declaring that [...] "a Portuguese wound is Brazilian pain".|$|E
2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1913 Lunn married Mabel Northcote, the {{granddaughter of}} Stafford Northcote, 1st Earl of Iddesleigh. They had three children, Peter, John and Jaqueta. Though not keen on mountaineering, Mabel shared her husband's love of skiing. She {{was the first woman}} to pass the British First Class skiing test, and she was a founder member of the Kandahar Ski Club. When her brother became 3rd Earl of Iddesleigh in 1927, she {{acquired}} the courtesy title of [...] "Lady Mabel". Her husband wrote: [...] "In the aristocracy of Mürren she welcomed this modest reminder of the fact that inventing the Slalom was not the only Lunn claim to respect." [...] The Swiss, however, <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>understand</b> how Arnold could be [...] "Mr. Lunn" [...] and his wife [...] "Lady Mabel", and their feelings were aptly conveyed {{by a member of the}} Kandahar who congratulated him when he was knighted [...] "on making an honest Lady out of Mabel." [...] Peter Lunn later became a noted British spymaster.|$|E
2500|$|Helms {{articulated}} several understandings, {{derived from}} his working knowledge and experiences as ambassador in Iran. [...] "He {{came to realize}} that he <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>understand</b> the Iranians," [...] writes William Shawcross. He quotes Helms, [...] "They have a very different turn of mind. Here would be ladies, dressed in Parisian clothes. ... But before they went on trips abroad, they would ship up to Mashhad in chadors to ask for protection." [...] Helms with his wife had visited the pilgrimage site in Mashhad, 'the tomb of the eighth Imam'. As to the Shah's statecraft, Helms' May 1976 memo observes, [...] "Iranian government and society are highly structured and authoritarian and all major decisions are made at the top. Often even relatively senior officials are not well informed about policies and plans and have little influence on them." [...] In July 1976 Helms send a message to State which, while confident, again voiced various concerns, e.g., about the [...] "inadequate 'political institutionalization'" [...] of the regime. Professor Abbas Milani comments that in 1975 Helms had [...] "captured the nature of the Shah's vulnerability when he wrote that 'the conflict between rapid economic growth and modernization vis-à-vis a still autocratic rule' was the greatest uncertainty about the Shah's future." [...] Milani, looking ahead after Helms' departure, writes that the election of President Carter in 1976 [...] "forced the Shah to expedite his liberalization plans." ...|$|E

I am not clever, I am nobody of any account, but I care for you so wonderfully.
