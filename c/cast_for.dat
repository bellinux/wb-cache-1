Some rare engines, such as the Lancia 22½° narrow-angle V12 of 1919, did use a single block <b>casting</b> <b>for</b> both banks.|$|R

5|$|Eskimo was not {{the first}} {{dramatic}} film to use an all-native <b>cast</b> <b>for</b> the native roles; that was the 1914 silent film In the Land of the Head Hunters.

Ray Mala became nationally famous for his work in Eskimo, and subsequently had a long career as a lead and supporting actor in Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Wilder {{was cast}} in {{a leading role in}} Mother Courage and Her Children, a {{production}} starring Anne Bancroft, who introduced Wilder to her boyfriend (and later husband) Mel Brooks. A few months later, Brooks mentioned that he was working on a screenplay called Springtime for Hitler, for which he thought Wilder would be perfect in the role of Leo Bloom. Brooks elicited a promise from Wilder that he would check with him before making any long-term commitments. Months went by, and Wilder toured the country with different theatre productions, participated in a televised CBS presentation of Death of a Salesman, and was <b>cast</b> <b>for</b> his first role in a film—a minor role in Arthur Penn's 1967 Bonnie and Clyde. After three years of not hearing from Brooks, Wilder was called for a reading with Zero Mostel, who was to be the star of Springtime for Hitler and had approval of his co-star. Mostel approved, and Wilder was <b>cast</b> <b>for</b> his first leading role in a feature film, 1968's The Producers.|$|E
