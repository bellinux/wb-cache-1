40|$|Eight {{years after}} {{installation}} {{on a test}} site, the enclosing properties of Hydrostab are undiminished and satisfy {{the requirements of the}} Dutch Decree on Soil Protection for Disposal to Landfill (“Stortbesluit” 1993). Also no change was found in the moisture content. Analysis of the processes and components that determine the characteristics of Hydrostab shows that C-S-H- and C-A-H-gels form from fly ash which subsequently fall apart and produce silica gels. In this process the <b>capillary</b> <b>pore</b> <b>space</b> initially decreases. Only after transformation of all C-S-H and C-A-H into silica-gel the amount of gel in the soil pores decreases slowly, producing the final end product quartz. In this process the <b>capillary</b> <b>pore</b> <b>space</b> increases. When the value of the <b>capillary</b> <b>pore</b> <b>space</b> increases above 0. 18, the sealing properties of Hydrostab decrease. This moment in time can therefore be marked {{as the end of the}} functional lifetime of the Hydrostab. Dependent on model parameterization this moment is 180 - 500 years in the futur...|$|E

40|$|Measurements of {{porosity}} and {{pore size}} distribution provide important data on the physical properties of soils. This paper presents a digital image method {{for the analysis of}} soil pores. In the analysis of soil thin sections, the image threshold separating <b>pore</b> <b>space</b> from the surrounding solid, as well as the <b>capillary</b> <b>pore</b> size threshold separating air <b>pores</b> and <b>capillary</b> <b>pores,</b> was obtained by analysis of the thin sections of calibration samples where values of total porosity and capillary porosity were pre-determined by traditional soil physics methods (IM). The total porosity and capillary porosity, as well as percentages of pores of a particular size, of all samples of similar soil type can then be determined by these image thresholds in thin section image analysis. The maximum <b>capillary</b> <b>pore</b> size in soils can also be determined. Because the thresholds for the total porosity and capillary porosity are determined based on physical soil characteristics in this method, the error associated with existing methods (caused by subjective threshold estimates) was overcome. Small variations in results proved that this method has good accuracy and is acceptable. Any personal computer and flatbed scanner, along with any commercial remote sensing software (ENVI, PCI, ERDAS, etc.) and Geographic Information System software (ArcGIS, ArcView, SuperMap, etc.) are sufficient to complete the method. In addition, the method can also be used for analysis of pore shapes and arrangements...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the pore connectivity and its influence on chloride transport property in cementitious materials under saturated condition. Mercury intrusion porosimetry experiment was carried out on a variety of hydrated cement pastes curing up to one year. By repeating pressurization-depressurization cycles, pore entrapment (namely ink-bottled effect) was expressed as a function of the equivalent diameter of penetrated throat neck pores. Accordingly, the small <b>capillary</b> <b>pores</b> that are present within patches of hydration products and the large <b>capillary</b> <b>pores</b> that are left out of hydration products were distinguished and their connections were ascertained, which provide evident basis for the study of transport property estimated by means of rapid chloride migration test on mortar samples. The results suggested that in hydrated cementitious system the <b>capillary</b> <b>pore</b> connections influencing mass transport should be mainly attributed to the connectivity of small <b>capillary</b> <b>pores,</b> whose relevance to chloride migration coefficient has also been testified by the well-fitted experimental plots in this study.

The numerical model is used to visualize this phenomenon and to show the contribution of both the pores and the ITZs to the continuation of <b>capillary</b> <b>pore.</b> Once the <b>capillary</b> <b>pores</b> are blocked by ongoing hydration the transport of harmful dilutions are restricted to move into the microstructure. However, distinction is made between the pore connectivity as developed in the bulk paste and the connectivity as developed by connected ITZs. A blockage of the <b>capillary</b> <b>pores</b> (pore discontinuity) as well as a blockage of the ITZs contribute to an increased depercolation of the cementitious microstructure and improve the microstructural performance.

Results indicated that pressure decreased the total pore volume, but increased the <b>capillary</b> <b>pore</b> volume due to the movement of grains. The space created could allow additional C–S–H growth during hydration (and later pozzolonic reaction).

40|$|Abstract. To more exactly {{predict the}} {{chloride}} diffusivity of cement paste, {{it is essential}} to determine the two-point probability function of <b>capillary</b> <b>pores.</b> The intention of the paper is to present a computer simulation method for evaluating the two-point probability function of <b>capillary</b> <b>pores.</b> By introducing three physical quantities to quantify the mutual interference between neighboring cement particles, the microstructure evolution of cement paste is simulated. Based on the simulated microstructure of cement paste, a numerical method is developed for evaluating the two-point probability function of <b>capillary</b> <b>pores.</b> After verifying the numerical method with the experimental results obtained from the literature, the effect of the hydration time and water/cement ratio on the two-point probability function is assessed in a quantitative manner.

40|$|In recent years, the {{durability}} of reinforced or prestressed concrete structures has become a main concern. A key parameter in durability predictions is the microstructure of the surface zone of concrete structures, i. e. the “covercrete”, more in particular the connectivity of the pores in the cement paste matrix. In this paper, the connectivity of <b>capillary</b> <b>pores</b> in hardening cement-based system made of blended materials is studied numerically. The blended materials include blast furnace slag and limestone powder. In the numerical simulation, the hydration of the multi-components, i. e. cement particle and filler particle are considered. The stereological aspect, the interaction mechanism on both cement particle and filler particle, the basic rate equation and the influence factors are modeled. The simulated microstructure parameters, like capillary porosity and connectivity of <b>capillary</b> <b>pores</b> were analyzed based on the percolation theory.

40|$|This study proposes an {{analytical}} model {{to relate the}} evolving microstructure of neat cement paste during hydration to the electrical resistivity measurement. The model {{is based on the}} general effective media theory and considers the contributions of both the low-resistivity phase (<b>capillary</b> <b>pores)</b> and the high-resistivity phase (gels and solids) in cement-pastes. The major parameters in the proposed model are the microstructural properties such as <b>capillary</b> <b>pore</b> percolation threshold and <b>pore</b> structure parameter, <b>capillary</b> <b>pore</b> phase and solid-gel phase resistivities. To validate the model, an empirical relationship between the resistivity formation factors and the phase volume fractions of a series of cement pastes has been built up with the assistance of noncontact electrical resistivity measurement and mercury intrusion porosimetry technique. The good agreement between the model and experimental data shows that it is feasible to obtain better understandings of the evolving microstructure of cement paste during the hydration using electrical resistivity measurement. Furthermore, based on the log-linear increase of resistivity with time, the porosity up to an age of a few months can be predicted by the proposed model. The predicted results show a good correlation with the experimental results in previous studies...|$|R
40|$|Supplementary Notes The {{purpose of}} this study was to design {{experimental}} laboratory equipment and perform experiments to investigate the basic physical processes that occur in concrete for periods of several hours to several days after mixing.
