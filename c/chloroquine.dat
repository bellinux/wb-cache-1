5|$|A complex amine-phenol Ga(III) {{compound}} MR045 is selectively {{toxic to}} parasites resistant to <b>chloroquine,</b> a common drug against malaria. Both the Ga(III) complex and <b>chloroquine</b> act by inhibiting crystallization of hemozoin, a disposal product formed from the digestion of blood by the parasites.|$|E
5|$|Given with <b>chloroquine</b> or quinine, {{clindamycin}} {{is effective}} and well tolerated in treating Plasmodium falciparum malaria; the latter combination is particularly useful for children, {{and is the}} treatment of choice for pregnant women who become infected in areas where resistance to <b>chloroquine</b> is common. Clindamycin {{should not be used}} as an antimalarial by itself, although it appears to be very effective as such, because of its slow action. Patient-derived isolates of Plasmodium falciparum from the Peruvian Amazon have been reported to be resistant to clindamycin as evidenced by in vitro drug susceptibility testing.|$|E
5|$|Chloroquine-{{resistant}} {{forms of}} P. falciparum emerged only 19 years later. The first resistant strains were detected around the Cambodia‐Thailand border and in Colombia, in the 1950s. In 1989, <b>chloroquine</b> resistance in P. vivax {{was reported in}} Papua New Guinea. These resistant strains spread rapidly, producing a large mortality increase, particularly in Africa during the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Quinine {{became the}} {{predominant}} malarial medication until the 1920s when other medications {{began to be}} developed. In the 1940s, <b>chloroquine</b> replaced quinine as the treatment of both uncomplicated and severe malaria until resistance supervened, first in Southeast Asia and South America in the 1950s and then globally in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, <b>chloroquine,</b> mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold. Also, bupropion {{should not be taken}} by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of drugs that can help prevent or {{interrupt}} malaria in travelers to places where infection is common. Many of these drugs are also used in treatment. <b>Chloroquine</b> may be used where chloroquine-resistant parasites are not common. In places where Plasmodium is resistant to one or more medications, three medications—mefloquine (Lariam), doxycycline (available generically), or the combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride (Malarone)—are frequently used when prophylaxis is needed. Doxycycline and the atovaquone plus proguanil combination are the best tolerated; mefloquine is associated with death, suicide, and neurological and psychiatric symptoms.|$|E
5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, traditional herbal remedies {{have been used}} to treat malaria. The first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of cinchona tree, which contains quinine. After the link to mosquitos and their parasites were identified in the early twentieth century, mosquito control measures such as widespread use of the insecticide DDT, swamp drainage, covering or oiling the surface of open water sources, indoor residual spraying and use of insecticide treated nets was initiated. Prophylactic quinine was prescribed in malaria endemic areas, and new therapeutic drugs, including <b>chloroquine</b> and artemisinins, were used to resist the scourge. Today, artemisinin is present in every remedy applied in treatment of malaria. After introducing artemisinin as a cure administered together with other remedies, the mortality in Africa went down by a half.|$|E
5|$|Simple or {{uncomplicated}} malaria may {{be treated}} with oral medications. The most effective treatment for P.falciparum infection {{is the use of}} artemisinins in combination with other antimalarials (known as artemisinin-combination therapy, or ACT), which decreases resistance to any single drug component. These additional antimalarials include: amodiaquine, lumefantrine, mefloquine or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. Another recommended combination is dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine. ACT is about 90% effective when used to treat uncomplicated malaria. To treat malaria during pregnancy, the WHO recommends the use of quinine plus clindamycin early in the pregnancy (1st trimester), and ACT in later stages (2nd and 3rd trimesters). In the 2000s (decade), malaria with partial resistance to artemisins emerged in Southeast Asia. Infection with P.vivax, P.ovale or P.malariae usually do not require hospitalization. Treatment of P.vivax requires both treatment of blood stages (with <b>chloroquine</b> or ACT) and clearance of liver forms with primaquine. Treatment with tafenoquine prevents relapses after confirmed P. vivax malaria.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chloroquine</b> {{reduces the}} {{bioavailability}} of praziquantel.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{component}} of the veterinary drug Tributame along with embutramide and <b>chloroquine</b> used to carry out euthanasia on horses and dogs.|$|E
25|$|The {{anticonvulsant}} {{effects of}} diazepam {{can help in}} the treatment of seizures due to a drug overdose or chemical toxicity as a result of exposure to sarin, VX, or soman (or other organophosphate poisons), lindane, <b>chloroquine,</b> physostigmine, or pyrethroids.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{recommendations}} of the World Health Organization, Nigeria decided to stop the prescription of <b>chloroquine,</b> the parasite responsible for malaria becoming resistant to this molecule used until today. Nigeria will be using Artemisinin, a more effective but also more expensive drug.|$|E
25|$|Molecules {{other than}} {{proteins}} can be separated by 2D electrophoresis. In supercoiling assays, coiled DNA is separated {{in the first}} dimension and denatured by a DNA intercalator (such as ethidium bromide or the less carcinogenic <b>chloroquine)</b> in the second. This {{is comparable to the}} combination of native PAGE /SDS-PAGE in protein separation.|$|E
25|$|The best-understood {{examples}} of such hematin biocrystallization inhibitors are quinoline drugs such as <b>chloroquine</b> and mefloquine. These drugs bind to both free heme and hemozoin crystals, and therefore block the addition of new heme units onto the growing crystals. The small, most rapidly growing face is the face to which inhibitors are believed to bind.|$|E
25|$|The pain, burning, swelling, and itching {{that occur}} in erythropoietic porphyrias {{generally}} require avoidance of bright sunlight. Most kinds of sunscreen are not effective, but SPF-rated long-sleeve shirts, hats, bandanas, and gloves can help. <b>Chloroquine</b> {{may be used to}} increase porphyrin secretion in some EPs. Blood transfusion is occasionally used to suppress innate heme production.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{formation}} of hemozoin {{is essential to the}} survival of these parasites, it is an attractive target for developing drugs and is much-studied in Plasmodium as a way to find drugs to treat malaria (malaria's Achilles' heel). Several currently used antimalarial drugs, such as <b>chloroquine</b> and mefloquine, are thought to kill malaria parasites by inhibiting haemozoin biocrystallization.|$|E
25|$|Methylene blue was {{identified}} by Paul Ehrlich about 1891 {{as a possible}} treatment for malaria. It disappeared as an anti-malarial during the Pacific War in the tropics, since American and Allied soldiers disliked its two prominent, but reversible side effects: turning the urine blue or green, and the sclera (the whites of the eyes) blue. Interest in its use as an anti-malarial has recently been revived, especially due to its low price. Several clinical trials are in progress, {{trying to find a}} suitable drug combination. According to studies on children in Africa, it appears to have efficacy against malaria, but the attempts to combine methylene blue with <b>chloroquine</b> were disappointing.|$|E
25|$|WHO's anti-malaria {{campaign}} of the 1950s and 1960s {{relied heavily on}} DDT {{and the results were}} promising, though temporary in developing countries. Experts tie malarial resurgence to multiple factors, including poor leadership, management and funding of malaria control programs; poverty; civil unrest; and increased irrigation. The evolution of resistance to first-generation drugs (e.g. <b>chloroquine)</b> and to insecticides exacerbated the situation. Resistance was largely fueled by unrestricted agricultural use. Resistance and the harm both to humans and the environment led many governments to curtail DDT use in vector control and agriculture. In 2006 WHO reversed a longstanding policy against DDT by recommending that it be used as an indoor pesticide in regions where malaria is a major problem.|$|E
25|$|Attempts to make {{synthetic}} antimalarials {{began in}} 1891. Atabrine, developed in 1933, was used widely throughout the Pacific in World War II, but was unpopular {{because of its}} adeverse effects. In the late 1930s, the Germans developed <b>chloroquine,</b> which went into use in the North African campaigns. Creating a secret military project called Project 523, Mao Zedong encouraged Chinese scientists to find new antimalarials after seeing the casualties in the Vietnam War. Tu Youyou discovered artemisinin in the 1970s from sweet wormwood (Artemisia annua). This drug became known to Western scientists in the late 1980s and early 1990s {{and is now a}} standard treatment. Tu won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2015.|$|E
25|$|When rhesus macaques {{were given}} interferon-α2b and {{ribavirin}} and exposed to MERS, they developed less pneumonia than control animals. Five critically ill people with MERS in Saudi Arabia with ARDS and on ventilators were given interferon-α2b and ribavirin but all ended up dying of the disease. The treatment was started late in their disease (a mean of 19 days after hospital admission) {{and they had}} already failed trials of steroids so {{it remains to be}} seen whether it may have benefit earlier in the course of disease. Another proposed therapy is inhibition of viral protease or kinase enzymes. Researchers are investigating a number of ways to combat the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, including using interferon, <b>chloroquine,</b> chlorpromazine, loperamide, and lopinavir, as well as other agents such as mycophenolic acid and camostat.|$|E
25|$|Although not {{formally}} a quinolone, nalidixic acid {{is considered the}} first quinolone drug. It was introduced in 1962 for treatment of urinary tract infections in humans. Nalidixic acid was discovered by George Lesher and coworkers in a distillate during an attempt at <b>chloroquine</b> synthesis. Nalidixic acid is thus {{considered to be the}} predecessor of all members of the quinolone family, including the second, third and fourth generations commonly known as fluoroquinolones. Since the introduction of nalidixic acid in 1962, more than 10,000 analogs have been synthesized, but only a handful have found their way into clinical practice. The first generation also included other quinolone drugs, such as pipemidic acid, oxolinic acid, and cinoxacin, which were introduced in the 1970s. They proved to be only marginal improvements over nalidixic acid.|$|E
25|$|Many {{substances}} {{are potentially}} harmful {{to people with}} G6PD deficiency. Variation {{in response to these}} substances makes individual predictions difficult. Antimalarial drugs that can cause acute hemolysis in people with G6PD deficiency include primaquine, pamaquine, and <b>chloroquine.</b> There is evidence that other antimalarials may also exacerbate G6PD deficiency, but only at higher doses. Sulfonamides (such as sulfanilamide, sulfamethoxazole, and mafenide), thiazolesulfone, methylene blue, and naphthalene should also be avoided by people with G6PD deficiency as they antagonize folate synthesis, as should certain analgesics (such as phenazopyridine and acetanilide) and a few non-sulfa antibiotics (nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, isoniazid, dapsone, and furazolidone). Henna has been known to cause hemolytic crisis in G6PD-deficient infants. Rasburicase is also contraindicated in G6PD deficiency. High dose intravenous vitamin C has also been known to cause haemolysis in G6PD deficiency carriers, thus G6PD deficiency testing is routine before infusion of doses of 25g or more.|$|E
500|$|Johann [...] "Hans" [...] Andersag {{and colleagues}} {{synthesized}} and tested some 12,000 compounds, eventually producing Resochin® {{as a substitute}} for quinine in the 1930s. It is chemically related to quinine through the possession of a quinoline nucleus and the dialkylaminoalkylamino side chain. Resochin (7-chloro-4- 4- (diethylamino) – 1 – methylbutyl amino quinoline) and a similar compound Sontochin (3-methyl Resochin) were synthesized in 1934. In March 1946, the drug was officially named <b>Chloroquine.</b> <b>Chloroquine</b> is an inhibitor of hemozoin production through biocrystallization. Quinine and <b>chloroquine</b> affect malarial parasites only at life stages when the parasites are forming hematin-pigment (hemozoin) as a byproduct of hemoglobin degradation.|$|E

She entered Georgetown University and earned a doctorate in Biochemistry in 1964. Regarding a harmful side effect {{of the use of}} <b>chloroquine</b> in the treatment of malaria, dangerous to the eyes, she co-authored The Ocular Deposition of <b>Chloroquine,</b> with Howard Bernstein, Nathan Zvaifler and Martin Rubin. After receiving her doctorate, Mansour returned to Chicago and accepted the chairmanship of the Mercy College Department of Physical Science and Mathematics. She also coached the basketball team.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Chloroquine</b> {{remains the}} {{treatment}} of choice for vivax malaria, except in Indonesia's Irian Jaya (Western New Guinea) region and the geographically contiguous Papua New Guinea, where <b>chloroquine</b> resistance is common (up to 20% resistance). [...] <b>Chloroquine</b> resistance is an increasing problem {{in other parts of}} the world, such as Korea and India.|$|E
2500|$|When <b>chloroquine</b> {{resistance}} is common or when <b>chloroquine</b> is contraindicated, then artesunate is the drug of choice, {{except in the}} U.S., where it is not approved for use. Where an artemisinin-based combination therapy has been adopted as the first-line treatment for P. falciparum malaria, {{it may also be}} used for P. vivax malaria in combination with primaquine for radical cure. An exception is artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS+SP), which is not effective against P. vivax in many places. Mefloquine is a good alternative and in some countries is more readily available. [...] Atovaquone-proguanil is an effective alternative in patients unable to tolerate <b>chloroquine.</b> Quinine may be used to treat vivax malaria but is associated with inferior outcomes.|$|E
2500|$|Johann Andersag (better {{known as}} Hans Andersag) was a {{scientist}} born on February 16, 1902, in Lana (Meran), Italy, and died August 10, 1955, in Wuppertal, Germany, following bronchial cancer. While working for Bayer AG, he discovered <b>chloroquine,</b> {{the active ingredient}} in the malaria drug Resochin. He also first synthesized vitamin B6 with Richard Kuhn, Kurt Westphal, and Gerhardt Wendt. He was awarded a doctorate degree for his dissertation [...] "Synthese des natürlichen Koproporphyrins sowie zweier damit isomerer Porphyrine" [...] at the Technical University Munich on September 9, 1927.|$|E
2500|$|An {{accurate}} {{diagnosis is}} becoming more and more important, in view of the increasing resistance of Plasmodium falciparum and the high price of alternatives to <b>chloroquine.</b> The enzyme pGluDH does not occur in the host red blood cell and was recommended as a marker enzyme for Plasmodium species by Picard-Maureau et al. in 1975. The malaria marker enzyme test is suitable for routine work and is now a standard test in most departments dealing with malaria. Presence of pGluDH is known to represent parasite viability and a rapid diagnostic test using pGluDH as antigen would have the ability to differentiate live from dead organisms. A complete RDT with pGluDH as antigen has been developed in China and is now undergoing clinical trials.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{generation}} of the quinolones began following introduction of the related, but structurally distinct naphthyridine-family nalidixic acid in 1962 for treatment of urinary tract infections in humans. Nalidixic acid was discovered by George Lesher and coworkers in a chemical distillate during an attempt at synthesis of the chloroquinoline antimalarial agent, <b>chloroquine.</b> Naphthyridone and quinolone classes of antibiotics prevent bacterial DNA replication by inhibition of DNA unwinding events, and can be both bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal. (See Mechanism of Action later.) The majority of quinolones in clinical use belong to the second generation class of [...] "fluoroquinolones", which have a true quinoline framework, maintain the C-3 carboxylic acid group, and add a fluorine atom to the all-carbon containing ring, typically at the C-6 or C-7 positions.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the first}} {{documentation}} of P. falciparum <b>chloroquine</b> {{resistance in the}} 1950s, resistant strains have appeared throughout East and West Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America. The effectiveness of <b>chloroquine</b> against P. falciparum has declined as resistant strains of the parasite evolved. They effectively neutralize the drug via a mechanism that drains <b>chloroquine</b> away from the digestive vacuole. Chloroquine-resistant cells efflux <b>chloroquine</b> at 40 {{times the rate of}} chloroquine-sensitive cells; the related mutations trace back to transmembrane proteins of the digestive vacuole, including sets of critical mutations in the P. falciparum <b>chloroquine</b> resistance transporter (PfCRT) gene. The mutated protein, but not the wild-type transporter, transports <b>chloroquine</b> when expressed in Xenopus oocytes and is thought to mediate <b>chloroquine</b> leak from its site of action in the digestive vacuole. Resistant parasites also frequently have mutated products of the ABC transporter P. falciparum multidrug resistance (PfMDR1) gene, although these mutations are thought to be of secondary importance compared to Pfcrt. Verapamil, a Ca2+ channel blocker, has been found to restore both the <b>chloroquine</b> concentration ability and sensitivity to this drug. Recently, an altered chloroquine-transporter protein CG2 of the parasite has been related to <b>chloroquine</b> resistance, but other mechanisms of resistance also appear to be involved. Research on the mechanism of <b>chloroquine</b> and how the parasite has acquired <b>chloroquine</b> resistance is still ongoing, as other mechanisms of resistance are likely.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chloroquine</b> {{enters the}} red blood cell, {{inhibiting}} the parasite cell and digestive vacuole by simple diffusion. <b>Chloroquine</b> then becomes protonated (to CQ2+), as the digestive vacuole {{is known to}} be acidic (pH 4.7); <b>chloroquine</b> then cannot leave by diffusion. <b>Chloroquine</b> caps hemozoin molecules to prevent further biocrystallization of heme, thus leading to heme buildup. <b>Chloroquine</b> binds to heme (or FP) to form the FP-chloroquine complex; this complex is highly toxic to the cell and disrupts membrane function. Action of the toxic FP-chloroquine and FP results in cell lysis and ultimately parasite cell autodigestion. In essence, the parasite cell drowns in its own metabolic products. Parasites that do not form hemozoin are therefore resistant to <b>chloroquine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Proguanil, {{also known}} as chlorguanide and chloroguanide, is a {{medication}} used to treat and prevent malaria. It is often used together with <b>chloroquine</b> or atovaquone. When used with <b>chloroquine</b> the combination will treat mild <b>chloroquine</b> resistant malaria. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
