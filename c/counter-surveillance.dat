It is commonly called the Fennelly Commission after its sole member, Nial Fennelly, a retired justice of the Supreme Court.

These Army deserters were enticed with salaries much higher than those of the Mexican Army. Cárdenas' goal was to protect himself from rival drug cartels and from the Mexican military.

50|$|On {{the morning}} of 22 July, {{surveillance}} officers believed that a man leaving the flats might have been Osman.

By the time they had arrived, de Menezes had entered Stockwell tube station and boarded a Tube train. Although no Kratos codeword had been given, the firearms officers believed him to be a suicide bomber. A surveillance officer seized de Menezes in a bear hug, and two plainclothes armed officers fired a total of nine shots, six of which struck his head from distances of 1 to 8 cm.

5000|$|Although Dev Sol {{was under}} active {{investigation}} by the American, British, French, Austrian and Danish intelligence and security services, it posed a significant challenge for counter-terrorist agents because {{it was one of}} the few terrorist organizations (at that time) to employ professional operational and counterintelligence tradecraft. It used sophisticated surveillance and <b>counter-surveillance</b> techniques, it employed multi-layer assassination squads with surveillance, primary and secondary shooters, and it successfully exfiltrated its operatives back and forth between Western Europe and Turkey as needed.

50|$|In February 2014, the Irish {{edition of}} The Sunday Times ran {{a series of}} stories {{claiming}} that {{the offices of the}} Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) had been bugged with a variety of highly sophisticated bugging equipment available only to government-level actors. GSOCs sole responsibility is to investigate wrongdoing in the Irish police force, the Garda Síochána, and there was widespread speculation that the Garda, or some rogue members or former members were responsible for the bugging to forestall investigations. John Mooney, the journalist who wrote the story, explicitly linked the bugging to GSOCs investigation of Garda handling of the case of Kieran Boylan, the convicted drug-runner who was assisted by gardaí in obtaining a passport, a haulage licence and had a prosecution for drug running terminated in extraordinary circumstances. Mooney reported that GSOC called in a specialist British <b>counter-surveillance</b> firm after a senior Garda, in a meeting with GSOC, let slip that he knew of information which GSOC staff had discussed including in a report, but had not actually included.|$|E
40|$|Targeting power {{constrained}} {{surveillance and}} <b>counter-surveillance</b> {{for a given}} sensor network, this work first design a power efficient surveillance system by sensor nodes coordination and cooperation, and then solve the power constrained sensor node covering and scheduling (PCSCS) problem by generalized maximal network flow. The <b>counter-surveillance</b> problem is formulated as a hide and seek game, which can be solved efficiently and optimally by game theory. The simulation results show that our surveillance scheduling algorithm is adapted to a large range of different G values and C node velocities. The typical event detection rate is over 50 % given G= 10.

40|$|We {{present a}} model of {{surveillance}} based on the detection of community structure in social networks. We examine the extent of network topology information an adversary is required to gather {{in order to obtain}} high quality intelligence about community membership. We show that selective surveillance strategies can improve the adversary’s resource efficiency. However, the use of <b>counter-surveillance</b> defence strategies can significantly reduce the adversary’s capability. We analyze two adversary models drawn from contemporary computer security literature, and explore the dynamics of community detection and hiding in these settings. Our results show that in the absence of <b>counter-surveillance</b> moves, placing a mere 8 % of the network under surveillance can uncover the community membership of as much as 50 % of the network. Uncovering all community information with targeted selection requires half the surveillance budget where parties use anonymous channels to communicate. Finally, the most determined covert community can escape detection by adopting decentralized <b>counter-surveillance</b> techniques even while facing an adversary with full topology knowledge- by investing in a small <b>counter-surveillance</b> budget, a rebel group can induce a steep increase in the false negative ratio. ...|$|E
40|$|Using {{empirical}} research drawn from field {{studies on the}} policing of ‘skid row ’ communities, this paper illustrates some of the theoretical, methodological and ethical problems that confront the researcher who studies surveillance and <b>counter-surveillance</b> within these contested settings. We begin by noting how, with {{the increasing use of}} the ‘broken windows ’ policing model to regulate deviant individuals and to secure derelict urban spaces, researchers may be implicated in the use of surveillance and <b>counter-surveillance</b> by community stakeholders. Drawing examples from direct and covert field observations, field notes, and photographs, we demonstrate that there is a significant potential for the researcher to become identified as an agent of surveillance, and as a potential target of <b>counter-surveillance,</b> within such settings. We conclude by considering some of the theoretical, methodological and ethical implications of the researcher’s complicity in these dynamics for both the conduct of surveillance studies in general, and for urban fieldwork in particular.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the use of}} visual technologies by political activists in protest situations to monitor police conduct. Using interview data with Australian video activists, this paper seeks to understand the motivations, techniques and outcomes of video activism, {{and its relationship to}} <b>counter-surveillance</b> and police accountability. Our data also indicated that there have been significant transformations in the organization and deployment of <b>counter-surveillance</b> methods since 2000, when there werelarge-scale protests against the World Economic Forum meeting in Melbourne accompanied by a coordinated campaign that sought to document police misconduct. The paper identifies and examines two inter-related aspects of this: the act of filming and the process of dissemination of this footage. It is noted that technological changes over the last decade have led to a proliferation of visual recording technologies, particularly mobile phone cameras, which have stimulated a corresponding proliferation of images. Analogous innovations in internet communications have stimulated a coterminous proliferation of potential outlets for images. Video footage provides activists with a valuable tool for safety and publicity. Nevertheless, we argue, video activism can have unintended consequences, including exposure to legal risks and the amplification of official surveillance. Activists are also often unable to control the political effects of their footage or the purposes to which it is used. We conclude by assessing the impact that transformations in both protest organization and media technologies might have for <b>counter-surveillance</b> techniques based on visual surveillance...|$|E
40|$|Since Edward Snowden’s {{revelations of}} US and UK {{surveillance}} programs, privacy advocates, progressive security engineers, {{and policy makers}} have been seeking to win majority support for countering surveillance. The problem is framed as the replacement of targeted surveillance with mass surveillance programs, and the solutions put forward are predominantly technical and involve the use of encryption – or ‘crypto’ – as a defense mechanism. The <b>counter-surveillance</b> movement is timely and deserves widespread support. However, as this article will argue and illustrate, raising the specter of an Orwellian system of mass surveillance, shifting the discussion to the technical domain, and couching that shift in economic terms undermine a political reading that would attend to the racial, gendered, classed, and colonial aspects of the surveillance programs. Our question is as follows: how can this specific discursive framing of <b>counter-surveillance</b> be re-politicized and broadened to enable a wider societal debate informed by the experiences of those subjected to targeted surveillance and associated state violence...|$|E
