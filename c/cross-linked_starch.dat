Static yield stress (0 -S) and dynamic yield stress (0 -D) of each dispersion were measured using the vane method {{before and after}} breaking down its structure by shearing, respectively. Increases in values of 0 -S with concentration of starch and -car-rageenan were higher for <b>cross-linked</b> <b>starch</b> than those of native starch. 0 -D values of <b>cross-linked</b> <b>starch</b> also increased with the concentration of starch and -carrageenan.

In this vein, this study assessed the applicability of epichlorohydrin <b>cross-linked</b> <b>starch</b> (EPIS), 1, 6 -hexamethylene diisocyanate <b>cross-linked</b> <b>starch</b> (HDIS), and 4, 4 -methylene diphenyl diisocyanate <b>cross-linked</b> <b>starch</b> (MDIS) polymer adsorbents for treatment of aqueous Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAHs) pollution in environmental water samples. Cross-linking process led to improvement in surface characteristics, level of hydrophobicity, and incorporation of relevant functional groups. Adsorption capacities of the adsorbents were in the order of MDIS>HDIS>EPIS. PAHs molecules were adsorbed in multi-layer, in a flat-wise orientation, while external and internal diffusion dominated the adsorption kinetics. Adsorption mechanisms suggested that these adsorbents spontaneously adsorb PAHs molecules driven mainly by enthalpy change, and the adsorption process was attributed to physisorption involving hydrophobic, van der Waals and π–π interactions between adsorbent and adsorbates. The thermodynamic evaluation indicated that the adsorption process was majorly endothermic and spontaneous. Desorption studies indicated that the adsorbents can be efficiently regenerated. The adsorbents were effective in treating simulated and real environmental water samples, and hence, are promising cost-effective alternative for control of aqueous PAHs pollution...|$|E

Normal corn starch (, 24 % amylose) was cross-linked by reacting with a mixture (99 : 1) of sodium trimetaphosphate (STMP) and sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) in an aqueous alkaline slurry containing sodium sulfate. The amount of the cross-linking agent (STMP/STPP mixture) in the starch slurry (100 g starch, 140 ml water, and 10 g sodium sulfate) was varied (4 – 12 g), and the level of cross-linking was monitored by the level of incorporated phosphorus, swelling volume, and a-amylase resistance.

The processing stability of modified starches was found to decrease in the order waxy maize> amylopectin potato > normal potato. The release of solubles increased in that order and the solubles from the normal potato starches were enriched in amylose. Molar mass determinations of the soluble fraction before and after saponification of the cross-links revealed that processing at high temperature caused much more molecular degradation than at high shear and that in all cases the soluble fraction was only scarcely cross-linked. These results suggest that the negative effect of amylose on processing stability is due to its ineffective cross-linking in the intact starch.

Because cross-linking could inhibit starch swelling and maintain starch granule integrity, the rice ball contain cross-linked rice flour could improve the texture and cooking loss. 本研究採用八十六年第二期之台梗糯一號與台中糯七十號原料米為試驗材料，以三種STMP(sodium trimetaphosphate) 濃度分別對米澱粉與溼磨米穀粉進行交鏈化反應，來探討不同交鏈化試劑濃度對米澱粉、溼磨米穀粉及其湯圓製品之影響。 在交鏈化米澱粉方面，米澱粉之交鏈化可提升其起始糊化溫度與回昇黏度，降低其裂解黏度、溶解度、膨潤力、在DMSO的溶解度與透光率。 在交鏈化溼磨米穀粉方面，米穀粉由於存在之蛋白質等成分會與交鏈化試劑STMP作用，而形成交鏈，使交鏈米穀粉之裂解黏度較交鏈化米澱粉為低。 在湯圓製品方面，蒸煮過久的湯圓，因其澱粉顆粒因過度膨潤而崩裂，使其蒸煮流失率會增加，並使湯圓質地上的硬度、膠質感與咀嚼性降低，內聚性與彈性增加。而含有部分交鏈化米穀粉的湯圓，因交鏈化能抑制澱粉顆粒的膨潤，維持澱粉顆粒的完整，故能改善造成湯圓久煮後的咀嚼性不佳等之特性。中文摘要……………………………………………………… [...] 1 英文摘要……………………………………………………… [...] 2 壹、 前言……………………………………………………… [...] 4 貳、 文獻整理………………………………………………… [...] 6 一、 稻米的分類與結構…………………………………… [...] 6 二、 交鏈澱粉……………………………………………… [...] 10 1. 交鏈化的原理…………………………………………. 10 2. 交鏈化的程序與試劑…………………………………. 10 3. 交鏈澱粉的性質………………………………………. 13 4. 影響交鏈化反應的因子………………………………. 18 5. 交鏈程度的測定………………………………………. 21 參、 研究目的………………………………………………… [...] 22 肆、 材料與方法……………………………………………… [...] 23 一、 原料…………………………………………………… 23 二、 實驗單元……………………………………………… 23 三、 實驗架構……………………………………………… 24 四、 樣品製備……………………………………………… 25 1. 溼磨米穀粉之製備…………………………………… 25 2. 米澱粉之分離………………………………………… 25 3. 交鏈化米穀粉及米澱粉之製備……………………… 25 五、 實驗方法…………………………………………… [...] . 26 1. 基本成分分析……………………………………… [...] 26 2. 理化特性分析……………………………………… [...] 26 (1) 連續糊化黏度之測定…………………………… 26 (2) 示差掃描熱分析………………………………… 27 (3) 溶解度與膨潤力的測定………………………… 27 (4) 在DMSO的溶解度…………………………… [...] 28 (5) 澱粉糊的透光率………………………………… 28 (6) 磷含量之測定…………………………………… 28 (7) 光學顯微鏡的觀察……………………………… 29 (8) 掃描式電子顯微鏡之觀察……………………… 29 3. 產品的品質評估……………………………………. 30 (1) 純湯圓的製作…………………………………… 30 (2) 含 30 %交鏈化米穀粉之湯圓的製作…………… 30 (3) 湯圓之蒸煮與蒸煮流失率的測定……………… 30 (4) 質地分析………………………………………… 31 (5) 產品色澤分析…………………………………… 31 4. 統計分析……………………………………………. 32 伍、 結果討論………………………………………………… 33 一、 STMP濃度對糯性米澱粉理化特性之影響…………. 33 1. 對米澱粉連續糊化黏度變化之影響………………. 33 2. 對米澱粉糊化行為變化之影響……………………. 38 3. 對米澱粉溶解度與膨潤力之影響 ……………… [...] . 39 4. 對米澱粉於DMSO溶解度之影響………………… 44 5. 對澱粉糊透光率之影響……………………………. 44 6. 對米澱粉光學顯微鏡照相圖之影響………………. 47 7. 對米澱粉掃描式電子顯微鏡照相圖之影響………. 47 8. 對磷含量之影響……………………………………. 52 二、 STMP濃度對糯性米穀粉理化特性之影響…………. 54 1. 對溼磨米穀粉基本化學成分之影響……………… 54 2. 對溼磨米穀粉連續糊化黏變化之影響…………… 54 3. 對溼磨米穀粉糊化行變化之影響………………… 60 4. 對溼磨米穀粉膨潤力與溶解度之影響…………… 60 三、 對湯圓產品品質的影響………………………………. 64 1. 對湯圓產品質地上之影響………………………… 64 2. 對湯圓產品蒸煮流失率之影響…………………… 67 3. 對湯圓產品色澤上之影響………………………… 69 陸、 結論………………………………………………………. 71 柒、 參考文獻…………………………………………………. 7...|$|R

Results from adsorption experiments showed that the polymer 1 prepared by 4, 4 '-methylene-bis-phenyldiisocyanate (MDI) as cross-linking agent exhibited higher adsorption behaviors {{than that of the}} polymer 2 prepared by hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI). Equilibrium and thermodynamic of four nitrophenols on polymer 1 were further studied. Analyzed experimental data showed that the Freundlich model fitted the isotherm data better than the Langmuir model of the four nitrophenols onto polymer 1. The thermodynamics for the adsorption of the nitrophenols on polymer 1 were estimated in the range of 303 - 333 K. It has been found that the values of Gibbs free energy (Delta G) became more negative with decreasing temperature, which indicated that the adsorption process was more favorable at low temperature...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} amylose-lipid (AM-L) {{complexes}} consisting of amylose populations with different peak degrees of polymerization (DP) and complexed with glyceryl monostearate (GMS) or docosanoic acid (C 22) on the pasting properties of wheat and rice starches was evaluated with a rapid visco analyzer (RVA). AM-L complexes were formed by both (i) addition of lipids to amylose fractions with peak DP 20, 60, 400, or 950 at 60 degrees C or (ii) potato phosphorylase-catalyzed amylose synthesis {{in the presence}} of lipids. All AM-L complexes affected pasting properties in line with their dissociation characteristics. AM-L complexes therefore have potential as "controlled lipid release agents" with effects markedly different from those observable with emulsifier addition in starch pasting. More in particular, short chain AM-L complexes resulted in a starch pasting behavior comparable to that of <b>cross-linked</b> <b>starch,</b> as evidenced by reduced granule swelling, good viscosity stability in conditions of high temperature and shear, and a stable cold paste viscosity. status: publishe...|$|E

The bifunctional {{precursors for}} the nitro-alkenes 1, 2, 3, and 4 were readily synthesized in high yields from nitromethane, paraformaldehyde and acetic anhydride (1, 3) or pivaloyl chloride (2, 4), respectively. The reaction {{rate for the}} cross-linking was very high, and for 1 and 3, the reaction reached completion within 1 h (at room temperature). The swelling capacities of the products obtained when starch was cross-linked with precursors for the nitroalkenes 1 - 4 and 6 were lower in comparison to epichlorohydrin <b>cross-linked</b> <b>starch.</b> These results indicate a high reaction effciency at low degrees of substitution. Cross-linked 2 -nitroalkyl starch ethers were synthesized in a one-pot synthesis by addition of 1 or 3 and 2 -nitroalkyl acetates to granular suspensions of starch. ...|$|E

The dual modified starches with level of cross-linking ranging from 0. 0000 to 0. 0186 were characterized for amylographic properties, swelling power, paste turbidity, and in vitro digestibility using porcine pancreatic a-amylase. The cross-linking procedure applied to dual modification nearly unchanged the pasting temperature, i. e. at 62. 5 °C. <b>Cross-linked,</b> hydroxypropyl <b>starches</b> with DS more than 0. 0150 had similar amylographic properties which showed high heat and shear {{stability of the}} paste.
