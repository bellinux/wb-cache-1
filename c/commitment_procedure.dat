40|$|Introduced into EU {{competition}} law by Article 9 of Regulation 1 / 2003, commitment decisions provide a settlement mechanism for Commission enforcement actions based upon concessions offered by defendant undertakings. The use of negotiated settlements is closely {{linked with the}} shift toward a more “regulatory” conception of {{competition law}}, however, and thus away from the orthodox antitrust paradigm. This article examines Commission practices to date under the <b>commitment</b> <b>procedure,</b> arguing that the enhanced flexibility and remedial choices available under Article 9 reflect characteristics more usually associated with the regulatory model. In view of the conventional criticisms of antitrust-as-regulation, the article furthermore considers {{the extent to which}} these regulatory attributes of the <b>commitment</b> <b>procedure</b> are problematic in practice, given that regulatory competition law does not incorporate the typical safeguards of ordinary regulation. The article concludes that, although the quasi-regulatory nature of commitment decisions is indisputable, its implications are more mixed. The increased effectiveness of Article 9, both as a means of alleviating market problems and of case disposition, must therefore be balanced against certain legitimacy and longer-term efficiency concerns...|$|E

40|$|The European Commission has {{launched}} a number of antitrust investigations against the major energy incumbents {{in the aftermath of}} the energy sector inquiry. Most of them have already been settled under Article 9 of the EC Regulation 1 / 2003 and the undertakings offered far-reaching, sometimes structural, commitments. This article studies the 2008 investigation into price manipulation in the German electricity wholesale market. In spite of no convincing evidence and flaws in the assessment, the Commission was able to negotiate from E. ON substantial capacity divestments. The Commission is straightforward about using antitrust rules to open up energy markets. Sector inquiries, <b>commitment</b> <b>procedure</b> and structural remedies allow for a quick intervention, flexible problem-solving and bring about decisive changes in the energy market setting. However, harnessing antitrust for the purpose of energy liberalization policy has an adverse impact on competition enforcement itself. First, it leads to a number of ‘weak’ cases, based on far-fetched arguments. Second, it results in remedies which are not tailored to the abuse at issue, but are in line with a wider objective of energy market liberalization, and as an outcome of negotiations, further swayed by the firm’s own interest in the ultimate shape of the commitment package. energy policy; competition law; Germany...|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} decade EU {{competition}} policy has had a clear focus: to punish and deter. The European Commission has increasingly imposed high fines and improved its leniency programme aimed at destabilizing cartels. However, enforcement {{with a focus on}} detection and punishment is costly and the administrative procedure is burdensome on both the undertakings under investigation and the Commission. Consequently, two formal procedures were introduced with a view to streamlining the administrative procedure and ensuring a swift solution through ‘negotiation’: the <b>commitments</b> <b>procedure</b> and the settlement procedure. In principle these two procedures should work to the advantage of both the Commission and the undertakings. All parties want the procedure to be fast and simple, without the need for appeal, although their underlying motives and interests differ. However, even assuming that these two procedures are in fact more efficient, the negative implications of (over) using these procedures can be substantial. First, the <b>commitments</b> and settlement <b>procedures</b> may directly affect the procedural safeguards and rights of defence that ought to be attributed to the undertakings concerned. Second, the <b>commitments</b> and settlement <b>procedures</b> may indirectly affect the overall effectiveness of the Commission’s competition law enforcement. In order to assess the effects of these two procedures on competition law enforcement, this research is based on two perspectives: (i) a micro perspective, evaluating the use of the <b>commitments</b> and settlement <b>procedures</b> to end investigations efficiently and the effect they will have {{on the rights of the}} undertakings; and (ii) a macro perspective, which will put the <b>commitments</b> and settlement <b>procedures</b> into a broader context and will evaluate the impact of these procedures on the overall competition law enforcement policy of the Commission. These two perspectives will form the basis for the conclusion, which will consist of a recommendation for a holistic approach towards this negotiated enforcement, which in essence will constitute a balancing act. status: publishe...|$|R

In New York State, a legislative committee recently found that more than 12, 000 violent incidents occurred each year throughout all twenty-eight of the State psychiatric centers.

40|$|First {{published}} online 8 December 2014. An {{increasingly important}} aspect of EU competition enforcement since {{the implementation of the}} modernization package has been the Commission’s use of a procedure for resolving cases without finding a violation based on remedial commitments offered by the undertakings. Similar non-adversarial tools have been used by national competition authorities and in other regulatory fields. Their common characterization as settlement procedures for the negotiated closure of cases has fuelled concerns about possible overuse to reorganize markets and contractual relationships. This is particularly so given that commitments are relatively opaque, afford limited judicial review and have been used in cases where existing rules and precedents do not clearly point to a violation. The article argues that the settlement view may not sufficiently capture either the design or the potential of the <b>commitments</b> <b>procedure</b> as a policy-learning device in cases where there is doubt about the nature and gravity of competition concerns in unfamiliar and changing market environments. In light of the transformation towards an effects-based EU competition law, commitment-based decisions may not be a second-best alternative, but the preferred and sometimes only mode of enforcement. Given the now overwhelming concerns about the legitimate use of this instrument, the article discusses how existing mechanisms could supply accountability without sapping the advantages of commitments as a policy-learning device, including an alternative role for judicial review...|$|R
