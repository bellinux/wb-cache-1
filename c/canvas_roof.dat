It {{normally}} had a <b>canvas</b> <b>roof</b> over the driver's compartment. In hotter areas, the <b>canvas</b> <b>roof</b> could be removed and the windshield folded down for extra ventilation.|$|E
25|$|Citroën {{unveiled}} {{the car at}} the Paris Salon on 7 October 1948. The car on display was nearly identical to the 2CV type A that would be sold the next year, but it lacked an electric starter, the addition of which was decided {{the day before the}} opening of the Salon, replacing the pull cord starter. The <b>canvas</b> <b>roof</b> could be rolled completely open. The Type A had one stop light, and was only available in grey. The fuel level was checked with a dip stick/measuring rod, and the speedometer was attached to the windscreen pillar. The only other instrument was an ammeter.|$|E
500|$|At the Flag Station Wilkes and {{his eight}} {{remaining}} men built a circular wall of lava rocks {{and covered the}} shelter with a canvas tent. A snowstorm was in progress and several suffered from altitude sickness. That night (December 23), the snow on the <b>canvas</b> <b>roof</b> caused it to collapse. At daylight some of the group went down the trail to retrieve firewood and the gear abandoned on the trail the day before. After another day's climb, nine men reached the rim of Mokuʻāweoweo. They {{could not find a}} way down its steep sides so chose a smooth place on the rim for the camp site, at coordinates [...] Their tent was pitched within [...] of the crater's edge, secured by lava blocks.|$|E
50|$|In 1879, Mrs. Girling {{rented a}} small farm of two acres called Tiptoe Farm, near Hordle, Lymington. Here they erected {{a number of}} wooden huts with <b>canvas</b> <b>roofs,</b> with a larger and {{superior}} hut {{as a place of}} public worship.|$|R
2500|$|Note: Generally {{there is}} no specific/official 'generation' {{categories}} on tramcars. As many of the trams in one generation were in fact just modifications of the previous, such as open-top cars fitted with <b>canvas</b> <b>roofs</b> and then wooden roofs. The term 'generation' should only apply [...] to the new designs.|$|R
50|$|In 1924 cabins {{were not}} complete, and campers stayed in tents. Early Camp Tecumseh cabins were wood frames with <b>canvas</b> <b>roofs</b> and <b>canvas</b> sides. Eventually the canvas was {{replaced}} by wooden shutters, but the same basic cabin structures were used until they were replaced in 1979. One of these old cabins remains on the camp grounds as a historical monument.|$|R
500|$|Bartlett's {{decision}} to deposit stores {{on the ice}} ensured that an ice camp, known as [...] "Shipwreck Camp", {{was more or less}} established by the time Karluk sank. Two shelters had been built, one a snow igloo with a <b>canvas</b> <b>roof,</b> the other constructed from packing cases. To the latter was added a kitchen with a large stove rescued from Karluk's engine room. A small, separate shelter was built for the five Inuit, and a rough perimeter created from coal bags and assorted containers. In McKinlay's words, the camp provided [...] "substantial and comfortable houses on which we could rely for shelter for a long time." [...] Stores were plentiful, and the party was able to eat well. Much of the time in the first days of the camp was spent preparing and adjusting clothing and sleeping gear, in readiness for the forthcoming march to Wrangel Island. The ice drift was slowly moving the camp {{in the direction of the}} island, but as yet there was insufficient daylight to attempt the march.|$|E
60|$|He {{rose with}} instant obedience, glad {{of a chance}} to serve her, and soon had the tent pegged to its place and the bedding unrolled. Together they lifted the wounded youth and laid him upon his {{blankets}} beneath the low <b>canvas</b> <b>roof</b> which seemed heavenly helpful to Berea.|$|E
60|$|He {{sat there}} for a long time, leaning forward, his head upon his hands. The wind that had been striving with the <b>canvas</b> <b>roof</b> all at once lifted its edges, and a moonbeam slipped {{suddenly}} in, and lay for a moment like a shining blade upon his shoulder; and, knighted by its touch, straightway plain Henry York arose, sustained, high-purposed and self-reliant.|$|E
50|$|The Salt Lake Tabernacle was {{inspired}} by an attempt to build a Canvas Tabernacle in Nauvoo, Illinois, in the 1840s. This tabernacle was to be situated just to the West of the Nauvoo Temple and was to be oval shaped, {{much the same as}} the Salt Lake Tabernacle. However, the Nauvoo edifice (never built) was to have amphitheater-style or terraced seating, and was to have <b>canvas</b> <b>roofing.</b>|$|R
50|$|As central Paris still {{required}} {{goods to}} be delivered, many French carrosiers started to offer special delivery vans with sunken rear lights, rolling shutters instead of doors that opened outwards, bumpers under the body {{instead of in}} front or behind, and other modifications which reduced the space they took up. Many of these vans also had raised or <b>canvas</b> <b>roofs</b> {{to allow them to}} carry more cargo while taking up less of the street.|$|R

The New York Times {{reported}} that pedestrian-walking became difficult and that one death was attributed to the storm. A sign pole, snapped by wind, landed on a 23-year-old man, crushing his skull and killing him instantly, while two others were knocked unconscious. Awnings and signs on many buildings broke and the <b>canvas</b> <b>roofing</b> at the Fire Department headquarters was blown off.|$|R
60|$|From this stand {{more than}} three fourths {{of those who were}} seated there had already broken out, since it had not fallen utterly, and by good fortune was open on all sides. Some, however, tangled in the <b>canvas</b> <b>roof,</b> were still trying to escape. Other poor creatures had been crushed to death, or, broken-limbed, lay helpless, or, worse still, were held down beneath the fallen beams.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{buildings}} were constructed after the Civil War. These generally {{are believed to}} have been sod houses for the officers and dugouts for the enlisted men cut into the bank along the Arkansas River, along {{the south side of the}} post. However, Sean Creevey, a professor at Dodge City Community College, claimed that all the first housing consisted of [...] "dugouts with <b>canvas</b> <b>roofs</b> dug into the bank of the Arkansas River." [...] He denied any were built of sod or adobe.|$|R
60|$|Silence {{followed}} the last words, while the friendly moon {{climbed up the}} sky. Each man's eye followed it, and each man's heart was busy with remembrances of other eyes and hearts that might be watching and wishing as theirs watched and wished. In the silence, each shaped for himself that vision of home that brightens so many camp-fires, haunts so many dreamers under <b>canvas</b> <b>roofs,</b> and keeps so many turbulent natures tender by memories which often are both solace and salvation.|$|R
50|$|In late 1943, {{expansion}} of the base was begun {{with an increase in}} apron area, structures more permanent than the original canvas-covered ones, and the reconstruction of housing facilities. Two PSP ramps each 50 ft wide, and a coral apron, 150 ft by 850 ft, were installed. Dock facilities were constructed, consisting of a small-boat wharf, 16 ft by 72 ft and a boat refueling wharf, 6 ft by 50 ft. Twelve screened frame wards with <b>canvas</b> <b>roofing</b> were provided for a 200-bed bas hospital.|$|R
60|$|Their {{examination}} of the ship was at first very slow, for they stepped about on tiptoe as if afraid of disturbing some of the ghosts of its former inhabitants. Then, a speculative gaze had to be turned on each object for a few moments, followed by an inquiring glance at each other. The deck and its accompaniments of masts rising through the <b>canvas</b> <b>roof,</b> and ropes, and blocks, hatches, skylights, companions, etcetera, afforded them matter for unbounded astonishment; though what they afterwards discovered below was productive of unutterable amazement.|$|E
60|$|I threw {{myself on}} the couch, and tried to read. But I soon {{exhausted}} my interest in my friend's library, and lay there staring {{through the open door}} on the green hillside beyond. The breeze again sprang up; and a delicious coolness, mixed with the rare incense of the woods, stole through the cabin. The slumbrous droning of bumblebees outside the <b>canvas</b> <b>roof,</b> the faint cawing of rooks on the opposite mountain, and the fatigue of my morning ride, began to droop my eyelids. I pulled the serape over me, as a precaution against the freshening mountain breeze, and in a few moments was asleep.|$|E
6000|$|He was {{scarcely}} eight {{when it was}} believed that he could have reasonably laid claim to the above title. But he never did. He was a small boy, intensely freckled to the roots of his tawny hair, with even a suspicion of it in his almond-shaped but somewhat full eyes, which were the greenish hue of a ripe gooseberry. All this was very unlike his parents, from whom he diverged in resemblance in that fashion so often seen in the Southwest of America, as if the youth of the boundless West had struck a new note of independence and originality, overriding all conservative and established rules of heredity. Something of this was also shown in a singular and remarkable reticence and firmness of purpose, quite unlike his family or schoolfellows. His mother was the wife of a teamster, who had apparently once [...] "dumped" [...] his family, consisting of a boy and two girls, on the roadside at Burnt Spring, with the <b>canvas</b> <b>roof</b> of his wagon to cover them, while he proceeded to deliver other freight, not so exclusively his own, at other stations along the road, returning to them on distant and separate occasions with slight additions to their stock, habitation, and furniture. In this way the <b>canvas</b> <b>roof</b> was finally shingled and the hut enlarged, and, under the quickening of a smiling California sky and the forcing of a teeming California soil, the chance-sown seed took root and became known as Medliker's Ranch, or [...] "Medliker's," [...] with its bursting garden patch and its three sheds or [...] "lean-to's." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{stations}} are designed as elevated structures with ticketing facilities {{on either the}} ground level (as seen in the KL Sentral station) or the first-floor level. The platforms are on the top floor, separated from the monorail lines by fencing. They were originally covered by large <b>canvas</b> <b>roofs,</b> which were replaced in 2014 by aluminium zinc roofs. Certain {{stations are}} situated above roadways, or are slightly longer than others. Each station used to be designated with a sponsor, with route maps associating each station with a particular product brand.|$|R
60|$|Oh! anywhere,--down {{with them}} on the river-bar, where they were working, if I liked. Or I could make myself at home in any of those cabins that I found lying round loose. Or perhaps it would be cooler and pleasanter for me in my friend's cabin on the hill. Did I see those three large sugar-pines, and, a little to the right, a <b>canvas</b> <b>roof</b> and chimney, over the bushes? Well, that was my friend's,--that was Dick Sylvester's cabin. I could stake my horse in that little hollow, and just hang round there till he came. I would find some books in the shanty. I could amuse myself with them or I could play with the baby.|$|E
60|$|In {{addition}} to these more conspicuous elements, the crowd contained sober operatives of the skilled sort possessed of sufficient means to bring hither their families, including the baby; there were section-hands and foremen, slashers, mule spinners, beamers, French-Canadians, Irish, Scotch, Welsh and English, Germans, with only an occasional Italian, Lithuanian, or Jew. Peanut and popcorn men, venders of tamales and Chile-con-carne hoarsely shouted their wares, while from afar could be heard the muffled booming of a band. Janet's heart beat faster. She regarded with a tinge of awe the vast expanse of tent that rose before her eyes, the wind sending ripples along the heavy canvas from circumference to tent pole. She bought the tickets; they entered the circular enclosure where the animals were kept; where the strong beams of the sun, in trying to force {{their way through the}} <b>canvas</b> <b>roof,</b> created an unnatural, jaundiced twilight, the weirdness of which was somehow enhanced by the hoarse, amazingly penetrating growls of beasts. Suddenly a lion near them raised a shaggy head, emitting a series of undulating, soul-shaking roars.|$|E
60|$|Fitted up {{with three}} tables for the {{purposes}} of play, and crowded with players and lookers on, it was, although the largest place of the kind upon the course, intensely hot, notwithstanding that a portion of the <b>canvas</b> <b>roof</b> was rolled back to admit more air, and there were two doors for a free passage in and out. Excepting one or two men who, each with a long roll of half-crowns, chequered with a few stray sovereigns, in his left hand, staked their money at every roll of the ball with a business-like sedateness which showed that they were used to it, and had been playing all day, and most probably all the day before, there was no very distinctive character about the players, who were chiefly young men, apparently attracted by curiosity, or staking small sums as part of the amusement of the day, with no very great interest in winning or losing. There were two persons present, however, who, as peculiarly good specimens of a class, deserve a passing notice.|$|E

60|$|It {{was high}} noon at Tres Pinos. The three pines {{from which it}} gained its name, in the dusty road and hot air, seemed to smoke from their balsamic spires. There was a glare from the road, a glare from the sky, a glare from the rocks, a glare from the white <b>canvas</b> <b>roofs</b> of the few shanties and cabins which made up the village. There was even a glare from the {{unpainted}} red-wood boards of Roscommon's grocery and tavern, and a tendency of the warping floor of the veranda to curl up beneath {{the feet of the}} intruder. A few mules, near the watering trough, had shrunk within the scant shadow of the corral.|$|R
60|$|For a {{month he}} journeyed from camp to camp, and then struck {{off from the}} Yuba to a spot sixteen miles away, where gold had been first found two months before, and a rush of diggers had taken place, owing to the reports of the {{richness}} of gold there. Already the trees {{on both sides of}} the slopes above the creek had been cleared, and a town principally composed of huts formed of the boughs of trees had sprung up. Here and there were tents, for the most part of blankets and rugs, three or four rough wooden stores, one or two large tents, and one of framework with sides of planks and a <b>canvas</b> <b>roof.</b> All these had their designations in bright-coloured paint on white canvas affixed to them. After choosing a place for his waggon on the outskirts of the encampment, Captain Hampton left Jacob to picket and feed the horses and light a fire, and then as usual proceeded in the first place to visit the saloons.|$|E
60|$|It was the {{old story}} of the southwestern miner's {{indolence}} and incompetency,--utterly distasteful to his northern habits of thought and education. Here was their old fatuous endurance of Nature's wild caprices, without that struggle against them which brought others strength and success; here {{was the old}} philosophy which accepted the prairie fire and cyclone, and survived them without advancement, yet without repining. Perhaps in different places and surroundings a submission so stoic might have impressed him; in gentlemen who tucked their dirty trousers in their muddy boots and lived only for the gold they dug, {{it did not seem}} to him heroic. Nor was he mollified as he stood beside the rude refreshment bar--a few planks laid on trestles--and drank his coffee beneath the dripping <b>canvas</b> <b>roof,</b> with an odd recollection of his boyhood and an inclement Sunday-school picnic. Yet these men had been living in this shiftless fashion for three weeks! It exasperated him still more to think that he might have to wait there a few days longer for the water to subside sufficiently for him to make his examination and report. As he took a proffered seat on a candle-box, which tilted under him, and another survey of the feeble makeshifts around him, his irascibility found vent.|$|E
60|$|He nodded grimly. Then Kells {{returned}} {{and led them}} back through the room to another door where spectators were fewer. Joan saw perhaps a dozen couples of rough, whirling, jigging dancers in a half-circle of watching men. The hall was a wide platform of boards with posts holding a <b>canvas</b> <b>roof.</b> The sides, were open; the lights were situated at each end-huge, round, circus tent lamps. There were rude benches and tables where reeling men surrounded a woman. Joan saw a young miner in dusty boots and corduroys lying drunk or dead in the sawdust. Her eyes were drawn back to the dancers, and to the dance that bore some semblance to a waltz. In the din the music could scarcely be heard. As far as the men were concerned this dance was a bold and violent expression of excitement {{on the part of}} some, and for the rest a drunken, mad fling. Sight of the women gave Joan's curiosity a blunt check. She felt queer. She had not seen women like these, and their dancing, their actions, their looks, were beyond her understanding. Nevertheless, they shocked her, disgusted her, sickened her. And suddenly when it dawned upon her in unbelievable vivid suggestion that they were the wildest and most terrible element of this dark stream of humanity lured by gold, then she was appalled.|$|E

50|$|Fort Atkinson, 2 mi west of Dodge City, had two lives. One life {{occurred}} before Kansas became a territory in 1854. The original Fort Atkinson was established August 8, 1850, by the U.S. Army {{in an attempt}} to prevent Indians in the area from attacking travelers on the Santa Fe Trail. Even before this, a site nearby was occupied in July 1850 by Lieut. Col. Edwin Vose Sumner, Who served as a Union major general in the Civil War. This first site was called Camp Mackay or Fort Mackay. Later the camp was moved to the site where it was permanently established. Sod buildings with <b>canvas</b> <b>roofs</b> were constructed. This post was abandoned in September 1853 and the buildings were torn down so Indians could not hide inside them and surprise travelers on the Trail.|$|R
