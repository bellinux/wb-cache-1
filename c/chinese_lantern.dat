He wrote a book in 1699 that was translated into French: Voyage around the World or Voyage du Tour du Monde (1719, Paris). [...] The novel documents his trip {{as one of the}} first Europeans to circle the world for pleasure rather than profit, using publicly available transportation. Gemelli Careri provides rich accounts of seventeenth-century civilization outside of Europe. These include Persia during the Ottoman Empire, Hindustan during the reign of Aurungzebe, the <b>Chinese</b> <b>Lantern</b> Festival and the Great Wall, and the native people of Meso-America. References to his books can be found in other historical publications like the Calcutta Review.|$|E

60|$|Across the moor {{a sea of}} shallow mist was rolling; and {{the trees}} in the valley, like {{browsing}} cattle, stood knee-deep in whiteness, with all the air above them wan from an innumerable rain as of moondust, falling into that white sea. Then the moon passed behind the lime-tree, so that a great lighted <b>Chinese</b> <b>lantern</b> seemed to hang blue-black from the sky.|$|E
60|$|IT was a {{frail and}} blue and lonely Carol who trotted to the flat of the Johnson Marburys for Sunday evening supper. Mrs. Marbury was a {{neighbor}} and friend of Carol's sister; Mr. Marbury a traveling representative of an insurance company. They made a specialty of sandwich-salad-coffee lap suppers, and they regarded Carol as their literary and artistic representative. She {{was the one who}} could be depended upon to appreciate the Caruso phonograph record, and the <b>Chinese</b> <b>lantern</b> which Mr. Marbury had brought back as his present from San Francisco. Carol found the Marburys admiring and therefore admirable.|$|E
60|$|Dane {{found it}} a {{somewhat}} depressing watch when the cooking fires had died out and the sounds which gather depth with the darkness emphasized the hush of the forest. There was nothing visible but the faint glimmer of the lighted tent, which suggested a huge <b>Chinese</b> <b>lantern</b> set down among the dripping undergrowth. Behind it loomed dim ghosts of trees. Moisture fell drumming upon the tight-strained canvas; and at intervals some beast in the forest sent up an unearthly scream. The darkness {{was filled with the}} scent of wood smoke and lilies, and thickened by wisps of drifting steam.|$|E

6000|$|Her {{first thought}} on waking was the fire. Her second, the Captain. He {{was in the}} room, she knew, because he was {{whistling}} in his usual low tone while moving about the fireplace preparing breakfast. She glanced at the curtains; her own curtains certainly,--and the bed too! Much surprised, she quietly put out her thin hand and drew the curtain slightly aside. The Captain in his shirt sleeves, as usual, preparing buttered toast, the fireplace, the old kettle with the defiant spout singing away as defiantly as ever, the various photographs, pot-lids, and other ornaments above the fireplace, the two little windows commanding an extensive prospect of the sky from the spot where she lay, the full-rigged ship, the <b>Chinese</b> <b>lantern</b> hanging from the beam-- everything just as it should be! ...|$|E
60|$|SIR.--I {{have just}} purchased, {{at a price}} that for any other English sixpenny paper I would have {{considered}} exorbitant, {{a copy of the}} Speaker at one of the charming kiosks that decorate Paris; institutions, by the way, that I think we should at once introduce into London. The kiosk is a delightful object, and, when illuminated at night from within, as lovely as a fantastic <b>Chinese</b> <b>lantern,</b> especially when the transparent advertisements are from the clever pencil of M. Cheret. In London we have merely the ill-clad newsvendor, whose voice, in spite of the admirable efforts of the Royal College of Music to make England a really musical nation, is always out of tune, and whose rags, badly designed and badly worn, merely emphasise a painful note of uncomely misery, without conveying that impression of picturesqueness which {{is the only thing that}} makes the poverty of others at all bearable.|$|E
6000|$|The {{actions of}} our seaman were now curious {{as well as}} prompt. Taking a blanket from his old friend's bed, he spread it below the chimney-piece, and in a remarkably short time pulled down, without damaging, every object {{on the wall and}} threw it into the blanket. He then added to the heap the <b>Chinese</b> <b>lantern,</b> the Turkish scimitar, the New Zealand club, the Eastern shield, the ornamented dagger, the worsted work sampler, the sou'-wester, the oiled coat, the telescope, the framed sheet of the flags of all nations, and the small {{portrait}} of the sea-captain in his [...] "go-to-meetin'" [...] clothes; also the big Bible and a very small box, which latter contained Mrs Roby's limited wardrobe. He tied all up in a tight bundle. A coil of rope hung on a peg on the wall. The bundle was fastened to the end of it and lowered to the ground, amid a fire of remarks from the crowd, which were rather caustic and humorous than complimentary.|$|E

6000|$|A {{little while}} after this, Arthur {{thought that he}} had had about enough dancing for awhile, and went and sat by himself in a secluded spot under the shadow of a tree-fern in a {{temporary}} conservatory put up outside a bow-window. The <b>Chinese</b> <b>lantern</b> that hung upon the fern had gone out, leaving his chair in total darkness. Presently a couple, whom he did not recognize, for he only saw their backs, strayed in, and placed themselves on a bench before him {{in such a way as}} to entirely cut off his retreat. He was making up his mind to disturb them, when they began a conversation, in which the squeezing of hands and mild terms of endearment played a part. Fearing to interrupt, lest he should disturb their equanimity, he judged it best to stop where he was. Presently, however, their talk took a turn that proved intensely interesting to him. It was something as follows:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Generally speaking, {{the rider}} is a lady, {{and then one}} feels that, for perfect bodily rest {{combined}} with entire freedom from mental anxiety, slumber upon a water-bed cannot compare with bicycle-riding upon a hilly road. No fairy travelling on a summer cloud could take things more easily than does the bicycle girl, according to the poster. Her costume for cycling in hot weather is ideal. Old-fashioned landladies might refuse her lunch, it is true; and a narrowminded police force might desire to secure her, and wrap her in a rug preliminary to summonsing her. But such she heeds not. Uphill and downhill, through traffic that might tax the ingenuity of a cat, over road surfaces calculated to break the average steam roller she passes, a vision of idle loveliness; her fair hair streaming to the wind, her sylph-like form poised airily, one foot upon the saddle, the other resting lightly upon the lamp. Sometimes she condescends to {{sit down on the}} saddle; then she puts her feet on the rests, lights a cigarette, and waves above her head a <b>Chinese</b> <b>lantern.</b>|$|E
6000|$|And yet {{perhaps of}} no time or country, {{for the last}} two {{thousand}} years, was it so true as here in this waste-weltering epoch of Sterling's and ours. A world all rocking and plunging, like that old Roman one when the measure of its iniquities was full; the abysses, and subterranean and supernal deluges, plainly broken loose; in the wild dim-lighted chaos all stars of Heaven gone out. No star of Heaven visible, hardly now to any man; the pestiferous fogs, and foul exhalations grown continual, have, except on the highest mountaintops, blotted out all stars: will-o'-wisps, of various course and color, take the place of stars. Over the wild-surging chaos, in the leaden air, are only sudden glares of revolutionary lightning; then mere darkness, with philanthropistic phosphorescences, empty meteoric lights; here and there an ecclesiastical luminary still hovering, hanging on to its old quaking fixtures, pretending still to be a Moon or Sun,--though visibly it is but a <b>Chinese</b> <b>lantern</b> made of paper mainly, with candle-end foully dying in the heart of it. Surely as mad a world as you could wish! ...|$|E
60|$|When {{the four}} boys reached that {{vicinity}} they found quite a crowd collected. More {{people were coming}} from the public square.

6000|$|The room {{in which}} she sat resembled the cabin of a ship in more respects than one. It was {{particularly}} low in the root so low that the seaman's hair touched it as he stood there looking round him; and across this roof ran a great beam, from which hung a variety of curious ornaments, such as a <b>Chinese</b> <b>lantern,</b> a Turkish scimitar, a New Zealand club, an Eastern shield, and the model of a full-rigged ship. Elsewhere on the walls were, an ornamented dagger, a worsted-work sampler, a framed sheet of the flags of all nations, a sou'-wester cap and oiled coat, a telescope, and a small staring portrait of a sea-captain in his [...] "go-to-meeting" [...] clothes, which looked very much out of keeping with his staring sunburnt face, and were a bad fit. It {{might have been a}} good likeness, and was certainly the work of one who might have raised himself to the rank of a Royal Academician if he had possessed sufficient talent and who might have painted well if he had understood the principles of drawing and colour.|$|E
6000|$|Do {{you want}} a man not to {{practise}} what he believes, then encourage him to keep often speaking it in words. Every time he speaks it, the tendency to do it will grow less. His empty speech of what he believes, will be a weariness and an affliction to the wise man. But do you wish his empty speech of what he believes, to become farther an insincere speech of what he does not believe? Celebrate to him his gift of speech; assure him that he shall rise in Parliament by means of it, and achieve great things without any performance; that eloquent speech, whether performed or not, is admirable. My friends, eloquent unperformed speech, in Parliament or elsewhere, is horrible! The eloquent man that delivers, in Parliament or elsewhere, a beautiful speech, and will perform nothing of it, but leaves it as if already performed,--what can {{you make of that}} man? He has enrolled himself among the Ignes Fatui and Children of the Wind; means to serve, as beautifully illuminated <b>Chinese</b> <b>Lantern,</b> in that corps henceforth. I think, the serviceable thing you could do to that man, if permissible, would be a severe one: To clip off a bit of his eloquent tongue by way of penance and warning; another bit, if he again spoke without performing; and so again, till you had clipt the whole tongue away from him,--and were delivered, you and he, from at least one miserable mockery: [...] "There, eloquent friend, see now in silence if there be any redeeming deed in thee; of blasphemous wind-eloquence, at least, we shall have no more!" [...] How many pretty men have gone this road, escorted by the beautifulest marching music from all the [...] "public organs;" [...] and have found at last that it ended--where? It is the broad road, that leads direct to Limbo and the Kingdom of the Inane. Gifted men, and once valiant nations, and as it were the whole world with one accord, are marching thither, in melodious triumph, all the drums and hautboys giving out their cheerfulest Ca-ira. It is the universal humor of the world just now. My friends, I am very sure you will arrive, unless you halt!-- ...|$|E
6000|$|No one {{who still}} {{believes}} in {{democracy and the}} rights of man will admit that any division between men and men can be anything but a fanciful analogy to the division between men and animals. But in the sphere of such fanciful analogy there are even human beings whom I feel to be like eats in this respect: that I can love them without liking them. I feel it about certain quaint and alien societies, especially about the Japanese. The exquisite old Japanese draughtsmanship (of which we shall see no more, now Japan has gone in for Progress and Imperialism) had a quality that was infinitely attractive and intangible. Japanese pictures were really rather like pictures made by cats. They were full of feathery softness and of sudden and spirited scratches. If any one will wander in some gallery fortunate enough to have a fine collection of those slight water-colour sketches on rice paper which come from the remote East, he will observe many elements in them which a fanciful person might consider feline. There is, for instance, that odd enjoyment of the tops of trees; those airy traceries of forks and fading twigs, up to which certainly no artist, but only a cat could climb. There is that elvish love of the full moon, as large and lucid as a <b>Chinese</b> <b>lantern,</b> hung in these tenuous branches. That moon is so large and luminous that one can imagine a hundred cats howling under it. Then there is the exhaustive treatment of the anatomy of birds and fish; subjects in which cats are said to be interested. Then there is the slanting cat-like eye of all these Eastern gods and men&mdash;but this is getting altogether too coincident. We shall have another racial theory in no time (beginning [...] "Are the Japs Cats?"), and though I shall not believe in my theory, somebody else might. There are people among my esteemed correspondents who might believe anything. It is enough for me to say here that in this small respect Japs affect me like cats. I mean that I love them. I love their quaint and native poetry, their instinct of easy civilisation, their unique unreplaceable art, the testimony they bear to the bustling, irrepressible activities of nature and man. If I were a real mystic looking down on them from a real mountain, I am sure I should love them more even than the strong winged and unwearied birds or the fruitful, ever multiplying fish. But, as for liking them, as one likes a dog&mdash;that is quite another matter. That would mean trusting them.|$|E
