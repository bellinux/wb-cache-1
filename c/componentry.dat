2500|$|Three Mk1 chassis were {{produced}} {{with the original}} aluminium construction, but the fourth incorporated advanced and exotic metal alloys. This included extensive use of titanium {{for many of the}} <b>componentry,</b> and a high percentage of magnesium sheet in the monocoque panelwork. Owing to its novel construction materials this car, chassis number 104, was referred to as the Ti-Mag Car. Gurney was well aware of the risks involved in driving a car made from such flammable materials. After witnessing Jo Schlesser's death in a magnesium-fuelled fireball during the 1968 French Grand Prix, Gurney compared racing in 104 to [...] "driving a Ronson cigarette lighter".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, {{continued}} rapid {{development in the}} increasingly competitive international voiturette class, {{and the introduction of}} the Alfa Romeo 158 and ERA B- and C-type models, forced the Maserati brothers into designing a new, square-bore, inline-4-cylinder engine. This new engine developed 30–50bhp more than the previous inline-6, the increase mostly achieved through an increase to four valves per cylinder, coupled to the use of a more powerful supercharger and a small increase in the compression ratio. Following customary Maserati practice, the engine was mounted into a chassis design almost identical to that of the 4CL's predecessor: the Maserati 6CM. Conventional in its architecture, twin box-section spars ran the length of the car joined, ladder-fashion, by smaller cross members, although the 4CL design did incorporate more aluminium <b>componentry</b> than its forebear. Although near-identical in its wheelbase, the 4CL's track was a full [...] wider than the 6CM, and sat lower thanks to repositioned spring hangers.|$|E

50|$|The {{production}} process was convoluted: the chassis {{was built in}} Basel and sent to Savigliano to receive the bodywork.
