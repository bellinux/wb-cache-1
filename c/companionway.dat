25|$|Ben-my-Chree's {{design was}} very much suited to the Edwardian era. Her five decks {{consisted}} of lower, main, shelter, promenade and boat decks, and offered ample room for her passengers. The promenade deck extended over two-thirds of the vessel's length. Above the promenade deck was the boat deck, extending over half of her length and affording ample shelter to passengers during inclement weather. The shelter deck was carried right fore and aft, and on each side there was a fine promenade. The centre of this deck consisted of cabins and public rooms while on the two decks below (the main and lower) there were additional public saloons. The first class passengers occupied the forward part {{of the ship and}} the second class the after part. There was a wide <b>companionway</b> forward allowing access to all decks via stairways.|$|E
500|$|Clouette {{describes}} the Elmer S. Dailey {{as having an}} [...] "almost rectangular hull in section and plan, with bluntly rounded bow and stern...the bulwarks, perforated by scuppers, rise up to the stem which is slightly raked back. There are prominent strakes in the bow and topside {{along the sides of}} the vessel. A coaming about [...] high frames the single large cargo opening which occupies about two-thirds of the boat's length". The cargo opening is covered by convex hatch covers. Towards the stern is a rectangular pilothouse and a low cabin with a <b>companionway</b> which has a protruding stack.|$|E
500|$|The barge {{measures}} [...] {{long with}} a [...] beam. The {{depth of the}} hold is listed at [...] {{and it had a}} listed capacity of 311 tons. Clouette describes the Priscilla Dailey as having a [...] "nearly rectangular hull in profile, section and plan, with squared-off stern and bluntly rounded bow. Low bulwarks with scuppers rise slightly to a peak where they join the prominently projecting stem. There are several raised strakes in the bow. The superstructure consists mainly of a single low coaming which extends nearly the length of the vessel". Toward the stern is a small cabin that has the same width and height of the coaming. In 1978, the National Register of Historic Places nomination noted that the convex hatch covers likely floated away and that the squarish hood over the <b>companionway</b> had washed away.|$|E
50|$|The D-Deck {{staircase}} opened {{directly onto}} the Reception Room and adjoining Dining Saloon. Behind the staircase were two arched entry vestibules and the <b>companionways</b> which communicated with First-Class staterooms in the forward part of the ship.|$|R
2500|$|The early steamers {{had a black}} {{hull and}} cabin sides and a black funnel. [...] On the {{incorporation}} of the company in 1906, the funnel colour was changed to yellow, with a black top. [...] Wheelhouses and <b>companionways,</b> where fitted were of varnished wood. [...] Early motor vessels also followed this livery, though none were fitted with funnels. a black hull - none were fitted with a funnel. By {{the time of the}} introduction of the MV [...] Dartmouth Castle of 1948, the motor vessels had their hulls and cabin sides painted white.|$|R
50|$|On C-Deck {{were the}} Purser's and Enquiry Offices, {{just off the}} Staircase on the Starboard side. Passengers could store their {{valuables}} with the Purser and submit Marconi messages sent via pneumatic tube to the Marconi Room. They could also purchase small items like postcards, pay for tickets to the Turkish Baths and Squash Court, reserve deck chairs, check out board games, and request their seating in the dining saloon, among other services. Long <b>companionways</b> branched off of the Staircase forward and aft containing First-Class staterooms, much like B-Deck above.|$|R
500|$|The Berkshire No. 7 {{is a small}} {{wood and}} steel canal barge that {{measures}} [...] long with a [...] beam. The depth of the hold is listed at [...] {{and it had a}} listed capacity of 216 tons. It is a transitional canal barge with steel framing and wood planking over the skeleton. Clouette describes the hull as being [...] "nearly rectangular in profile, section and plan, with squared-off stern and bluntly rounded bow. Low bulwarks with scuppers rise slightly to a peak where they join the prominently projecting stem". The superstructure is primarily of a single low coaming with convex hatch covers that runs almost the full length of the shop. A rectangular cabin rises up above the coaming and has a <b>companionway</b> in the rear. The Berkshire No. 7 is listed in the U.S. Registry as #172071.|$|E
2500|$|Aft of the nav {{station on}} the port side {{at the base of the}} <b>companionway</b> is the head. A {{louvered}} teak bi-fold door provides access to the space. Built as a complete molded head unit with full headroom and good ventilation, it includes a vanity sink, marine head, an abundance of mirrored storage cabinets, and a large separate stall shower with a Plexiglas door and dividing partition. [...] Hot and cold pressurized water system and electric shower sump pump complete the systems.|$|E
2500|$|At about noon on January 27, 1903, Peter Gearin, a crewman on Metlako, either leaped or {{fell off}} the boat into the Columbia River and was drowned. [...] The {{incident}} occurred at Reedâ€™s Island in the Columbia River, as Metlako was steaming upstream from Vancouver, where Gearin had boarded the vessel. [...] Gearin was seen to dive off the <b>companionway</b> into the river, but whether it was suicide or an accidental loss of footing, could not be determined. [...] The boat stopped to look for him, but no trace could be located, so Metlako continued on its way. Gearin, age 38, {{had been working on}} steamboats for about 15 years.|$|E
5000|$|The early steamers {{had a black}} {{hull and}} cabin sides and a black funnel. On the {{incorporation}} of the company in 1906, the funnel colour was changed to yellow, with a black top. Wheelhouses and <b>companionways,</b> where fitted were of varnished wood. Early motor vessels also followed this livery, though none were fitted with funnels. a black hull - none were fitted with a funnel.

6000|$|The {{first officer}} {{told me that}} the Flora was privileged to carry 125 passengers. She must have had all of 200 on board. All the cabins were full, all the cattle-stalls in the main stable were full, the spaces at the heads of <b>companionways</b> were full, every inch of floor and table in the swill-room was packed with {{sleeping}} men and remained so until the place was required for breakfast, all the chairs and benches on the hurricane deck were occupied, and still there were people who had to walk about all night! ...|$|R
5|$|Before all the {{steerage}} passengers {{had even}} {{a chance of}} their lives, the Titanics sailors fastened the doors and <b>companionways</b> leading up from the third-class section... A crowd of men {{was trying to get}} up to a higher deck and were fighting the sailors; all striking and scuffling and swearing. Women and some children were there praying and crying. Then the sailors fastened down the hatchways leading to the third-class section. They said they wanted to keep the air down there so the vessel could stay up longer. It meant all hope was gone for those still down there.|$|R
2500|$|... (MORCEE Model Only) The {{cabin is}} fully {{enclosed}} {{and has two}} fixed lights in the cabin top for visibility and interior illumination. The <b>companionway</b> closes with teak hatch slides. Forward a double V berth is raised a few inches above the cabin sole and is fitted with two 3" [...] foam cushions in a choice of colours. To port, supplied as standard, is a galley unit with sink and integral water tank filled through a plug located in one corner. To starboard, provision has been made for installation of a marine head (optional). Two forward utility shelves are moulded above the berths. There is a small hatch in the cabin sole top access the bilge.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] {{furnishings}} of the Contessa 32 cabin {{are typical}} of boats of her size and vintage. There is a V-shaped berth in the bow, followed by a small head (toilet) to port opposite a wet-locker and shower. The saloon (main cabin area) includes a folding table, with sofas that double as berths, the table lowering to convert the port berth to a double. At the aft end of the saloon next to the <b>companionway,</b> and to port, is a small U-shaped galley, consisting of a stove, sink (fed by an 18-gallon freshwater tank), and a counter. To starboard, there is a chart table, with a quarter berth extending aft of the navigators seat. An inboard marine diesel engine of 15 to 25 horsepower is mounted beneath the cockpit, fed by a 12-gallon fuel tank. Modern boats have a Beta Marine 20 or 25 horsepower engine with folding or feathering propellor, in conventional or hybrid configuration.|$|E
2500|$|Prince of Wales raised {{anchor and}} {{returned}} to sea, sailing aimlessly north and east {{in the hope of}} finding a more hospitable village from which to seek a guide. Shortly after midnight on 22 January she collided with a Chinese ship, striking the Chinese vessel amidships and crushing her under Prince of Wales bow. The English vessel suffered damage to her hull and the loss of her jib-boom, which fell over the side into the Chinese vessel. The smaller Chinese craft was more heavily damaged and began to sink, her crew scrambling overboard to avoid being dragged down with her. Several Chinese sailors sought to climb aboard Prince of Wales, panicking Milner's crew. Paine recorded in his journal that [...] "the Alarm caused me to jump from my cot and run to the arms chest, but such was the call for cutlasses that {{it was not until the}} third or fourth attempt I could reach the deck, being accosted each time in the <b>companionway</b> with [...] "O give me that cutlass sir, and get another for they are coming on board." ...|$|E
60|$|Other shots soon followed, {{and in the}} {{excitement}} of the moment Walter's presence on board was forgotten. The Merrimac was now running at a tremendous rate of speed, her fires roaring fiercely and her boilers threatening to burst at any instant. Quivering from stem to stern under such high pressure, she shot into the harbor entrance and straight for the narrowest part of the channel. By this time the Spanish guns from all sides were sending down on her a shower of shot and shell, awful to contemplate. Seeing he could do nothing, Walter ran for the shelter of one of the <b>companionways.</b>|$|R
50|$|He {{is renowned}} {{for his ability}} to nearly drown, and his {{frequent}} falls from every manner of ship are a bit of a running joke in the series. While fairly sure-footed on land, he manages to get into mortal peril in even the calmest water - allowing Jack Aubrey to demonstrate his proficiency at diving rescues - and is prone to plunging down hatches and <b>companionways</b> on board ship. His clumsiness may (in part) be due to his torture by the French at Mahon early in the book series. Despite this, he is a crack shot with both pistol and rifle, and is an expert swordsman and veteran duelist, and continues to perform successful surgeries.|$|R
60|$|The deck-full {{of blacks}} shrieked their merriment, and Jerry, his rage undiminished, his {{immediate}} antagonist {{out of the}} battle, mistaking himself {{as the object of}} the laughter of the blacks, turned upon them, charging and slashing the many legs that fled before him. They dropped down the cabin and forecastle <b>companionways,</b> ran out the bowsprit, and sprang into the rigging till they were perched everywhere in the air like monstrous birds. In the end, the deck belonged to Jerry, save for the boat's crew; for he had already learned to differentiate. Captain Van Horn was hilariously vocal of his praise, calling Jerry to him and giving him man-thumps of joyful admiration. Next, the captain turned to his many passengers and orated in beche-de-mer English.|$|R
60|$|Taking {{the things}} with them, they hastily descended the <b>companionway.</b>|$|E
60|$|Grief leaned {{up against}} the <b>companionway,</b> {{surprise}} and pain depicted on his face.|$|E
60|$|Retiring under {{shelter of}} the <b>companionway</b> he struck a light and ignited the blue fire.|$|E
60|$|As {{originally}} planned, the Snark {{was to be}} {{forty feet}} long on the water-line. But we discovered there was no space for a bath-room, {{and for that reason}} we have increased her length to forty-five feet. Her greatest beam is fifteen feet. She has no house and no hold. There is six feet of headroom, and the deck is unbroken save for two <b>companionways</b> and a hatch for'ard. The fact that there is no house to break the strength of the deck will make us feel safer in case great seas thunder their tons of water down on board. A large and roomy cockpit, sunk beneath the deck, with high rail and self- bailing, will make our rough-weather days and nights more comfortable.|$|R
5000|$|... 2nd-Class staterooms {{were very}} comfortable, {{featuring}} oak paneling painted a glossy white, linoleum floors, mahogany furniture usually {{consisting of a}} large sofa, wardrobe, and dressing table with washbasin, mirror, and storage shelves. All the taps were connected to huge freshwater tanks located deep within the ship and many rooms contained [...] "tipped" [...] washbasins on shelves that could be folded back into the cabinet to save room. Shared staterooms were segregated by sex, so that single women or men often shared staterooms with one another. Unlike in First-Class, which offered many staterooms with private bathrooms, Second-Class bathroom facilities were all shared. Communal lavatories and bathrooms were separated by <b>companionways</b> and divided by sex. A bath could be had on request to a steward and bed linen was changed daily.|$|R
5|$|For {{those who}} were not injured or killed {{outright}} by moving objects, there was little time to reach safety, especially for the men who were manning the guns on the main deck or fetching ammunition and supplies in the hold. The <b>companionways</b> that connected the decks with one another would have become bottlenecks for fleeing men, something indicated by the positioning of many of the skeletons recovered from the wreck. What turned the sinking into a major tragedy in terms of lives lost was the anti-boarding netting that covered the upper decks in the waist (the midsection of the ship) and the sterncastle. With the exception of the men who were stationed in the tops in the masts, most of those who managed to get up from below deck were trapped under the netting; they would have been in view of the surface, and their colleagues above, but with little or no chance to break through, and were dragged down with the ship. Out of a crew of at least 400, fewer than 35 escaped, a catastrophic casualty rate of over 90%.|$|R
60|$|To their {{surprise}} the <b>companionway</b> was not blocked with ice and the doorway was shut.|$|E
60|$|He {{had turned}} off the light proper, {{consequently}} the way to the <b>companionway</b> was rather dark.|$|E
60|$|Presently Phil Jones {{came up the}} <b>companionway</b> {{to throw}} {{something}} over the side. I immediately approached him.|$|E
60|$|Rushing {{down the}} <b>companionway,</b> Luke entered {{the cabin and}} knocked on the door of Captain Ponsberry's stateroom.|$|E
60|$|When {{the hatch}} was opened {{a man with}} a black beard pushed himself forward towards the <b>companionway.</b>|$|E
60|$|They {{closed the}} door leading to the <b>companionway</b> and then tiptoed their way to where Larry lay.|$|E
60|$|They {{had almost}} {{passed to the}} last step of the <b>companionway</b> when Sam called a sudden halt.|$|E
60|$|Jacobsen {{shrugged his}} {{shoulders}} in calm acquiescence to fate, and Griffiths stepped to the <b>companionway</b> and went below.|$|E
60|$|The {{three were}} soon ready, and crawled up the <b>companionway</b> and {{out on the}} rain-drenched and {{slippery}} deck.|$|E
60|$|As {{quickly as}} he could, Dick rushed from the {{wheelhouse}} and toward the <b>companionway</b> leading to the engine room.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} the three men stood as if paralyzed, then all of them made a bolt for the <b>companionway.</b>|$|E
60|$|They {{walked toward}} the cabin {{and ran down the}} <b>companionway.</b> At the lower doorway they paused and then Tom grinned.|$|E
