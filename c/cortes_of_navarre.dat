50|$|On 23 March 1513, the <b>Cortes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Navarre</b> reunited in Pamplona (Iruñea in Basque), {{greatly reduced}} to the pro-Spanish Beaumont party, and pledged {{allegiance}} to Ferdinand {{in exchange for his}} loyalty to the Navarrese laws. In 1515, Upper Navarre was annexed to the Crown of Castile as a different kingdom (aeque principalis), and it would be one constituent part of the Kingdom of the Spains, as Spain came to be known during the following period.|$|E
50|$|A {{brilliant}} orator, and {{accustomed to}} a monarchy controlled by the <b>Cortes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Navarre</b> (the equivalent of the States General), Charles the Bad championed the reform of a state considered too arbitrary, leaving no voice to the nobility or the cities (John the Good governed with a circle of favorites and officers sometimes of humble extraction). Unlike his father, Charles V thought that a king must have the approval of his subjects and must listen to their advice. This view allowed him to approach the Norman nobles and the reformists, and thus Charles of Navarre.|$|E
50|$|From 1515 until 1841, Upper Navarre was {{in effect}} an {{autonomous}} kingdom in personal union with the Spanish crown. It was allowed to retain a large degree of home rule, preserving much of {{the institutions of the}} independent kingdom, not exempt of tensions with the ever centralizing drive of Castile and attempts at reunification with independent Navarre {{to the north of the}} Pyrenees led by the Parliament. In 1528, the <b>Cortes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Navarre</b> sitting at Pamplona authorised a simplified law code known as the Fuero Reducido. Although widely used, it was never confirmed by the king.|$|E
50|$|Isabel d'Albret <b>of</b> <b>Navarre</b> (1512-1555) was the {{daughter}} of John III <b>of</b> <b>Navarre</b> (died 1516) and Catherine I <b>of</b> <b>Navarre,</b> sister and heiress of Francis Phoebus, King <b>of</b> <b>Navarre.</b> As heir apparent, her brother rose to the throne in 1517 as Henry II <b>of</b> <b>Navarre,</b> grandfather <b>of</b> King Henry III <b>of</b> <b>Navarre</b> (Henry IV <b>of</b> France).|$|R

5000|$|As the Kingdom of Navarre was {{originally}} organized, it {{was divided into}} merindades, districts governed by a merino ("mayorino", a sheriff), {{the representative of the}} king. They were the [...] "Ultrapuertos" [...] (French Navarre), Pamplona, Estella, Tudela and Sangüesa. In 1407 the merindad of Olite was added. The <b>Cortes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Navarre</b> began as the king's council of churchmen and nobles, but {{in the course of the}} 14th century the burgesses were added. Their presence was due to the fact that the king had need of their co-operation to raise money by grants and aids, a development that was being paralleled in England.|$|E
50|$|Depressed by the defeats and adverse {{diplomatic}} results, John III died at {{the castle}} of Esgouarrabaque in Monein, Béarn, on 14 June 1516 after lying gripped by fatal fevers. Up to the last moment he struggled to get Navarre back from the Spanish, urging his wife, Queen Catherine, to send a representative to the <b>Cortes</b> <b>of</b> Castile to demand {{the restoration of the}} kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Navarre.</b> Despite his wish to be buried at the Santa Maria Cathedral of Pamplona, the permanent Spanish occupation prevented that. His corpse rests instead at the Cathedral of Lescar along with Queen Catherine, who outlived him only a few months.|$|R

50|$|In November 1592, the Parliament (<b>Cortes)</b> <b>of</b> Aragón revolted {{against another}} {{breach of the}} realm-specific laws, so the Attorney General (Justicia) of the kingdom, Juan de Lanuza, was {{executed}} on Philip II's orders, with his secretary Antonio Perez taking exile in France. In Navarre the major strongholds of the kingdom were garrisoned by troops alien to the kingdom (Castilians) in conspicuous violation of the laws <b>of</b> <b>Navarre,</b> and the Parliament had long been refusing to pledge loyalty to Philip II's son and heir apparent without a proper ceremony. On 20 November 1592 a ghostly Parliament session was called, pushed by Philip II, who had arrived in Pamplona {{at the head of}} an unspecified military force, and with one only point on his agenda—attendance to the session was kept blank on the minutes: unlawful appointments of trusted Castilian officials and an imposition of his son as future king <b>of</b> <b>Navarre</b> at the Santa Maria Cathedral. A ceremony was held before the bishop of Pamplona (22 November), but its customary procedure and terms were altered. Protests erupted in Pamplona, but they were quelled.|$|R
50|$|She was the {{youngest}} daughter of Sancho VI <b>of</b> <b>Navarre</b> and Sancha <b>of</b> Castile, who died in 1179, about two years after Blanche's birth.
