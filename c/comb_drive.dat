While the device can be used to perform ordinary tension tests, its components are designed to specifically allow for creep/stress relaxation tests on nanofibers that demonstrate time dependent behavior, e. g. polymeric and biological nanfibers. In this platform, the samples are stretched by a <b>comb</b> <b>drive</b> actuator. The <b>comb</b> <b>drive</b> displacement is translated to the sample through an untethered shuttle. In order to engage the <b>comb</b> <b>drive</b> to the shuttle, two sets of teeth are symmetrically distributed {{on both sides of the}} shuttle, which are engaged with a pair of hooks connected to <b>comb</b> <b>drive</b> upon its actuation. To achieve constant deformation on the sample, specifically desired in stress relaxation tests, a pair of thermal actuators, referred to as thermal grips, are positioned on both sides of the shuttle, which grip the shuttle in its position when actuated. In addition, by proper sequencing of the electrical signals to the comb drives and thermal grips large deformations can be achieved, which can be used for mechanical characterization of highly deformable nanofibers. One of the key elements of this device is the on-chip, high stiffness and piezoresistivity based loadcell, which allows for load measurements in the order of micro- and sub microNewton forces in real time and at a fast rate.
