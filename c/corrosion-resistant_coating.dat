The impact of the absorbed water on the properties of ChCl- 2 Urea IL, including viscosity, electrical conductivity, electrochemical window and chemical structure was investigated.

This technique has been utilized to protect metals from corrosion in industrial applications that involve high temperature operations. The HAPC method creates a hard, <b>corrosion-resistant,</b> diffusional <b>coating</b> on the substrate of a softer metallic material through chemical reactions that occur when heating up a mixture of an inert filler, a master alloy (aluminum in this study) and a halide activator. Pure nickel, Ni- 5 wt. % Cr and Ni- 10 wt. % Cr were aluminized at 750, 850 and 950 ??C for 9 h in this study using the sodium halides (sodium fluoride, chloride and bromide) as activators. The effects of chromium content and activator on aluminized nickel-based substrates were studied using various techniques. Thickness measurements showed that the sodium fluoride activator produced the thickest coating for a given temperature and substrate followed by the sodium chloride and sodium bromide activators. The effect of the chromium content was not definitive across the different activators, e. g. coating thicknesses increased with chromium content for the NaCl activator; however, this trend was not followed for the NaF-activated packs.

Typical columnar microstructures and aerodynamically smooth surfaces are obtained without the need for final polishing or conditioning of cooling holes. Due to the columnar microstructure, the lifetime of the TBC is prolonged and the damage tolerance improved.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. We {{demonstrate}} that graphene coating can provide efficient protection from oxidation by posing a high-energy {{barrier to the}} path of oxygen atom, which could have penetrated {{from the top of}} the graphene to the reactive surface underneath. A graphene bilayer, which blocks the diffusion of oxygen with a relatively higher energy barrier, provides even better protection from oxidation. While an oxygen molecule is weakly bound to a bare graphene surface and hence becomes rather inactive, it can easily dissociate into two oxygen atoms adsorbed to low-coordinated carbon atoms at the edges of a vacancy. For these oxygen atoms the oxidation barrier is reduced and hence the protection from oxidation provided by graphene coatings is weakened. Our predictions obtained from the state-of-the-art first-principles calculations of the electronic structure, phonon density of states, and reaction path will unravel how graphene can be used as a <b>corrosion-resistant</b> <b>coating</b> and guide further studies aimed at developing more efficient nanocoatings...|$|E

The electrochemical behaviors and electronic {{properties of the}} passive films developed on the MoSi 2 -based nanocomposite coatings in 3. 5 wt% NaCl solution were characterized using various electrochemical analytical techniques, including potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), potential of zero charge and Mott-Schottky analysis.

Both plasma nitriding and Al alloying can suppress transpassive dissolution of molybdenum by increasing the ratio of Mo(iv) to Mo(vi), and, thus, reduce the donor density of the passive films. In addition, it is observed that both treatments increase the differences between corrosion potential and potential of zero charge and thereby enhance the capability to repulse chloride ions.

40|$|Electroactive {{conducting}} polymers (ECPs) {{continue to}} be of considerable interest as components of <b>corrosion-resistant</b> <b>coating</b> systems. ECPs, {{in addition to being}} conductive, are redox active materials, typically with potentials that are positive of iron and aluminum. Thus, as with chromate, interesting and potentially beneficial interactions of ECPs with active metal alloys such as steel and aluminum are anticipated. In this work, the scanning vibrating electrode technique (SVET), also known as the current density probe, was used to probe such interactions between a poly(3 -octyl pyrrole) coating (POP) and cold-rolled steel and aluminum (Al 2024 -T 3) substrates. The POP coatings were scribed to simulate a defect through the coating to the metal substrate surface. The SVET was used to map the current flowing in and around the defect while the sample was immersed in either 3 % NaCl (steel) or in dilute Harrison solution (aluminum), an aqueous solution consisting of 0. 35 % (NH 4) 2 SO 4, 0. 05 % NaCl. Although there were significant differences in the behavior of the POP-coated steel and POP-coated aluminum substrates, both exhibited a significant delay before the onset of any observable current compared to uncoated or epoxy-coated samples. Current density maps for the steel clearly indicate that the reduction reaction occurred on the conducting polymer surface, with oxidation confined to the defect. Current density maps for the aluminum alloy never displayed significant oxidation at the defect. Rather, reduction (after a significant delay) occurred at the defect as well as across the polymer surface, with concomitant localized undercoating oxidation of the aluminum substrate...|$|E

Although pure Al coatings electrodeposited from the bath without ZrCl 4 are lusterless, bright and smooth coatings were obtained when the ZrCl 4 content in the baths was 0. 005 – 0. 015 mol per 10 mol DMSO 2. The Zr content in the coatings varied up to 3. 5 at % in proportion to the ZrCl 4 content in the baths. The bright Al-Zr alloy coating showed high reflectance of 50 – 80 % in the wavelength range of 450 – 1000 nm, whereas that of the matte pure Al coating was 10 – 20 %. Morphological observations confirmed a reduction in the grain size of Al and surface leveling caused by the addition of ZrCl 4 to the baths. Moreover, a strong 〈 100 〉 preferential orientation of Al crystals was observed for the bright coatings.

40|$|There {{currently}} {{exists a}} broad range of applications for which the ability to produce an adherent, hard, wear and, <b>corrosion-resistant</b> <b>coating</b> plays a vital role. These applications include engine components, orthopedic devices, textile manufacturing components, hard disk media, optical coatings, and cutting and machining tools (e. g., punches, taps, scoring dies, and extrusion dies). Ion beam processing can {{play an important role in}} all of these technologies. Plasma source ion implantation (PSII) is an emerging technology which has the potential to overcome the limitations of conventional ion implantation by: (1) reducing the time and expense for implanting onto complex shapes and large areas and (2) extending the thickness of the modification zone through ion beam enhanced plasma growth of surface coatings. In PSII, targets are placed directly in a plasma source and then pulse biased to produce a non-line-of-sight process for complex-shaped targets without complex fixturing. If the pulse bias is a relatively high negative potential (20 to 100 kV) ion implantation will result. If however, a low voltage (50 [...] 1, 200 eV) high duty cycle pulse bias is applied, film deposition from the chamber gas will result, thereby increasing the extent of the surface modification into the 1 [...] 10 micron regime. To evaluate the potential for DLC to be used as a corrosion barrier, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and traditional electrochemistry techniques were used to investigate the breakdown mechanism in chloride and nonchloride containing environments.

The newly developed coating exhibited an extremely dense and homogeneous microstructure, exhibiting a strong (002) preferred orientation. The electrochemical behavior and semiconducting properties, such as donor density, flat-band potential, and diffusivity of point defects (Do), of the passive film formed on the β-Ta coating were compared to those for both uncoated Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and commercially pure Ta in Ringer’s physiological solution at 37 °C, using an array of complementary electrochemical techniques. The {{results showed that the}} β-Ta coating not only provided Ti- 6 Al- 4 V with good corrosion protection but also endowed a higher resistance to corrosive attack than commercially pure Ta in Ringer’s physiological solution at 37 °C. Mott−Schottky analysis revealed that the passive film formed on the β-Ta coating had a lower donor density and flat-band potential than commercially pure Ta. The calculated values of Do for the β-Ta coating (1. 45 × 10 − 16 cm 2 /s) are comparable to that for commercially pure Ta (1. 13 × 10 − 16 cm 2 /s), both of which are 1 order of magnitude lower than that for uncoated Ti- 6 Al- 4 V (2. 73 × 10 − 15 cm 2 /s). Compared with commercially pure Ta, the higher corrosion resistance of the β-Ta coating results from its nanosized grains and crystallographic orientation, which promotes the rapid formation of a robust passive film with a more compact structure.

40|$|Polyethylene (PE) {{adhesives}} used {{in combination}} with a PE topcoat and a fusion bonded epoxy (FBE) {{are one of the}} most common pipeline <b>corrosion-resistant</b> <b>coating</b> systems used in the oil and gas industry. The role of the adhesive in binding the topcoat to the steel surface is critical to ensuring long term protection against corrosion attack to the pipeline. Consistent with this, it is important to understand how adhesion is optimised by controlling the physical and chemical properties of the adhesive. In this work, adhesives were produced by grafting maleic anhydride (MAH) on to the polymer backbone of an inert polyethylene via free radical chemistries during reactive processing then investigating adhesive performance as function of grafting. The effects of particle size on adhesion performance were also studied for two mean particles sizes of 300 μm and 125 μm. Overall, increasing MAH (along with increasing DBP) concentration enhanced the degree of grafting, as characterised by FTIR spectroscopy, which in turn resulted in enhanced interfacial interaction between the non-polar PE topcoat and polar FBE. However, an intermediate level of MAH was found to produce the greatest adhesion due to a subsequent increase in viscosity, as shown by changes in the melt flow index (MFI) and reduced wetting of the adhesive to the primer at higher MAH concentrations. Thermal analyses using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) confirmed that functionalization of the PE adhesive disrupted its semi-crystalline structure by reducing melting temperature (Tm) and degree of crystallinity (Xc). Investigation of the effects of particle size and coating interval time revealed that finer particle sizes of ≤ 300 μm produced further improvement in adhesion strength compared to the coarser particles size ≥ 300 μm, while longer interval times degraded the adhesion performance of the coating system. This finding suggests that, apart from grafting efficiency, selection of particle size and coating times are important considerations for achieving optimum coating adhesion performance in three-layer PE coating systems...|$|E
