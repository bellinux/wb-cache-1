40|$|Important {{information}} concerning the multipolarity, spin, and parity changes in a nuclear transition may be obtained by comparing experimentally measured internal conversion coefficients with those theoretically predicted (1). In determining these conversion coefficients by taking {{the ratio of the}} number of internal conversion electrons emitted to the number of emitted gamma rays for a given transition, the gamma ray intensities usually have the largest error. Internal <b>conversion</b> <b>line</b> intensities may be measured using a magnetic spectrometer wit. h an error of one or two percent while the gamma-ray intensities are frequently in error from five to ten percent or more. Since the theoretical calculations of internal conversion coefficients are estimated to be accurate to about five percent, it is desirable to measure internal conversion coefficients with an error of not more than five percent for a meaningful comparison. Thus a means must be found to reduce the uncertainty in the gamma-ray intensity measurements. It is usually sufficient to measure relative intensities and then to compute relative internal conversion coefficients. ·By a suitable normalization procedure absolute internal conversion coefficients may be obtained...|$|E

40|$|Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor [L] Moench) {{was first}} {{introduced}} to the United States in the 1800 s. These introductions consisted of tropical varieties with a short day photoperiod response that limited their use in temperate hybrid breeding programs. Commercial exploitation of F 1 hybrids in grain sorghum started by the mid 1950 s {{with the use of}} cytoplasmic male sterility system CMS (A 1). Even though other CMS are available, most sorghum hybrid seed production still relies on the A 1 system. Genetic gain in most agronomic crop species is limited by several factors. In the specific case of sorghum, the uniform use of the CMS (A 1) system and the recent introduction of sorghum to the United States have resulted in a reduction of its genetic base. In order to create enough genetic variability, plant breeders might utilize exotic non adapted material, exotic adapted material or existing elite material as a source of new alleles that will protect and improve genetic gain through selection. This study provides an estimate of the genetic diversity existing in a set of sorghum <b>conversion</b> <b>lines.</b> The objectives of this study were: (1) to estimate the genetic diversity present among a set of 16 sorghum <b>conversion</b> <b>lines????</b> (2) to classify this set of lines based on genetic similarities estimated using AFLP markers and (3) to estimate heterosis, general and specific combining ability for grain yield among the set of <b>conversion</b> <b>lines.</b> Genetic diversity was present in the set of <b>conversion</b> <b>lines</b> evaluated. For the lines included only in this study, Caudatum was the most homogenous race (average GS = 0. 69), and this race was closely related to the Durra race (Average GS = 0. 66). Two other homogenous races were Bicolor and Kafir with average GS of 0. 67. Highest GCA effects were obtained from the Kafir and Caudatum races. Good heterotic responses were obtained from DurraKafir races and CaudatumKafir races. Estimation of SCA, MPH and BPH identified specific crosses that were numerically superior than those of the checks. The use of AFLP markers allowed the identification of five strong clusters through estimates of genetic similarities. This classification did not group the lines by either their genetic background or their fertility reaction.

The domestic supply of Pu- 238 consists of scrap material from previous mission production or material purchased from Russia. Currently, the United States has no significant production scale operational capability to produce and separate new Pu- 238 from irradiated neptunium- 237 targets. The Department of Energy - Nuclear Energy is currently evaluating and developing plans to reconstitute the United States capability to produce Pu- 238 from irradiated Np- 237 targets. The Savannah River Site had previously produced and/or processed all the Pu- 238 utilized in Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) for deep space missions {{up to and including}} the majority of the plutonium for the Cassini Mission. The previous full production cycle capabilities included: Np- 237 target fabrication, target irradiation, target dissolution and Np- 237 and Pu- 238 separation and purification, conversion of Np- 237 and Pu- 238 to oxide, scrap recovery, and Pu- 238 encapsulation. The capability and equipment still exist and could be revitalized or put back into service to recover and purify Pu- 238 /Np- 237 or broken General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) pellets utilizing existing process equipment in HB-Line Scrap Recovery, and H-anyon Frame Waste Recovery processes. The conversion of Np- 237 and Pu- 238 to oxide can be performed in the existing HB-Line Phase- 2 and Phase- 3 Processes.

40|$|Ice core {{records from}} Greenland and Antarctica reveal large and rapid {{variations}} in atmospheric methane concentrations ([CH₄]) {{in response to}} abrupt climate change. Two such events occurred at the Oldest Dryas (OD) - Bølling and Younger Dryas (YD) - Preboreal (PB) climatic transitions during the last glacial termination. A record of ¹⁴C of atmospheric CH₄ (¹⁴CH₄) through these transitions can help to identify {{the sources of the}} [CH 4] increases and constrain the fossil fraction of paleo CH₄ budgets. Very large (1 ̃ 00 L STP) samples of paleoatmospheric air are needed for such ¹⁴CH₄ measurements. To obtain these samples, ancient ice outcropping at an ice-margin ablation site in West Greenland was explored. Ice sections dating to the last glacial termination were identified and found to contain high-quality gas records. A new method for large-scale air extraction from glacial ice was developed and twelve large air samples from the YD-PB and the OD-Bølling transitions were obtained. New methods were also developed for processing this air for ¹⁴CH₄. ¹⁴CH₄ procedural blanks were greatly reduced through {{the construction of a new}} CH₄ <b>conversion</b> <b>line</b> utilizing platinized quartz wool for CH₄ combustion and the use of an ultra high purity iron catalyst for graphitization. The overall ¹⁴CH₄ processing blank was 0. 75 ± 0. 38 pMC. Measured ¹⁴CH₄ values were too high by 14 - 38 % as compared to the highest expected values based on paleoatmospheric ¹⁴CO₂. In-situ production of CH₄ and direct cosmogenic production of ¹⁴CH₄ molecules in ablating ice were identified as the two most likely mechanisms that elevated ¹⁴CH₄. Sample ¹⁴CH₄ was then corrected for both mechanisms, however these corrections are speculative and do not allow any definite conclusions to be drawn from the results. Corrected ¹⁴CH₄ results suggest that there was a 7 % increase in the fossil CH₄ fraction from the YD to the PB. The corrected ¹⁴CH₄ results also suggest no large changes in the fossil fraction between the OD and the YD. Finally, the corrected results suggest that up to 80 % of the OD - Bølling [CH₄]- rise (1 ̃ 00 ppb) was due to ¹⁴C -free CH...|$|E

A magnetic lens spectrometer {{has been used}} to measure electron yields from the internal conversion of certain nuclear gamma rays. Auxiliary experiments have been performed to determine the effective solid angle of the spectrometer. A technique which has previously proven to be successful has been tested and employed in the measurement of gamma-ray yields by means of a scintillation counter. The combination of conversion electron and gamma yield measurements constitutes an experimental determination of an internal conversion coefficient, and by comparison with theory it is possible to make gamma-ray multipole order assignments. Bi 207 decays to an isomeric state of Pb 207 at 1. 63 Mev which emits two successive gamma rays with energies 1. 06 and 0. 57 Mev, the decay proceeding through a level at 0. 57 Mev. Internal <b>conversion</b> <b>lines</b> from both transitions have been observed previously.

We have measured the conversion coefficient of the 440 -kev transition and assign it either E 1 or M 1, the experimental uncertainties preventing a definite assignment. Results of other work are cited which indicate M 1 is correct. We have attempted to measure the conversion coefficient of the 470 -kev line in Na 24 produced in [ [...] . ]. The low intensity of the line, however, permits only the statement that it is of multipole order less than [ [...] . ]. The lens spectrometer has also been employed to survey the low energy gamma ray spectrum resulting from [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ]. The electron spectra from external photoelectric converters suggest lines at 118 ? 5 and 275 ? 15 kev from the first reaction and 196. 5 ? 4 kev from the latter...|$|R
