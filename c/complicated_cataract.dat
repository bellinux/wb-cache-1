50|$|Multifocal glued IOLs {{have been}} done with the ReZoom (Abbott Medical Optics), and Tecnis (Advanced Medical Optics or AMO) IOLs. This makes it {{possible}} to offer the accommodative IOL advantage even to patients with an absent capsule. The modified Prolene polyvinylidene fluoride haptic in these IOLs helps in being more stiff as well as having superior memory. Sutured scleral-fixated IOLs in pediatric eyes have been known to be associated with problems.Multifocal IOLs allow good vision at a range of distances. Monofocal intraocular lenses which are commonly available give clear point of focus in the distance or closer, but you can choose only one focal point. Multifocal intraocular lenses are designed to avoid the need for glasses by providing two or more points of focus. These intraocular lenses are intended to be placed in the capsular bag. Until recently, it was difficult to provide multifocality for patients who had <b>complicated</b> <b>cataract</b> surgeries which lack normal capsules. Aphakia with deficient capsule has been a limitation for obtaining multifocality. Now multifocality is possible even in <b>complicated</b> <b>cataract</b> surgeries by the Multifocal Glued IOL procedure. In this multifocal IOL implantation is done even in eyes with large posterior capsular rupture (PCR) and aphakias with deficient posterior capsule.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Purpose. There {{has been}} {{undertaken}} in this research, {{in case of}} <b>complicated</b> <b>cataracts,</b> an attempt of definition of a role of prostaglandins Е 2 (PgЕ 2) in mechanisms of cancellation of immune responses, responsible for ACAID, in the early period of the aseptic uveitis course. Material and method. The patients with senile and <b>complicated</b> <b>cataracts</b> underwent the microaxial phonoemulsification. The first group included patients with senile uncomplicated cataract (400 eyes), the second one – with cataract, proceeding associated with primary open-angled glaucoma (200 eyes), the third group – with cataract, proceeding associated with pseudoexfoliative glaucoma (200 eyes), the fourth group – with cataract, proceeding associated with arterial hypertension (300 eyes), the fifth one – with cataract, proceeding associated with diabetes mellitus (100 eyes), and the sixth group – with cataract, proceeding associated with previous trauma (100 eyes). The studied contingent of patients has been examined using subjective and objective methods of research standard in ophthalmology. Aqueous humor of patients of all six studied groups (80 tests in each group) was subjected to immunoenzymatic level definition of prostaglandins Е 2, using kits of the firm DRG International Inc. (USA). The content of prostaglandins Е 2 was expressed in pg/ml. Immunoenzymatic researches (ELISA) were conducted with the autoanalyzer «Stat Fax 3200 » (USA) in wavelengths of absorption of 420 - 450 nm. The obtained results were statistically analyzed, using the Student criteria and the SPSS- 13 software. Results. In case of <b>complicated</b> <b>cataracts,</b> namely cataracts, proceeding associated with open-angle and pseudoexfoliative glaucoma, and also in traumatic cataracts, an inflammatory process in form of anterior aseptic uveitis was observed in the early post-operative period. Relative high indices of prostaglandins Е 2 were determined in the aqueous humor of the above-mentioned contingent of patients. Conclusions. 1. An «inadequate» inflammatory reaction to the surgical intervention that we found in case of <b>complicated</b> <b>cataracts</b> testifies in favor of cancellation of the regional immune responses, responsible for an ACAID formation. 2. In the mechanism of disturbed ACAID function in case of cataracts, proceeding associated with primary open-angle and pseudoexfoliative glaucoma, {{as well as in}} traumatic cataracts, an important role should be given to prostaglandins Е 2 which high level in the aqueous humor can lead to an inhibition of active immunologic tolerance, lying {{at the heart of the}} above specified symptom-complex. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Assessment of {{complication}} {{in surgery}} of <b>complicated</b> <b>cataracts</b> and option of postponement of surgery. Setting: Clinic for eye diseases, Clinical Centre of Serbia Methods: This was a retrospective observational case series. Results: In 16 patients subjected to cataract surgery by method of phacoemulsification, three experienced complications during surgery. Two experienced rupture of posterior lens capsule and prolapse of the vitreous body, and one, expulsive hemorrhage. The visual acuity {{in all three}} patients was lesser than the preoperative visual acuity. In the second group of 16 patients, after having been acquainted with the survey, the cataract surgery was postponed and the patients were controlled after one year. The cataract progressed just partially in certain patients and all the patients {{were satisfied with the}} status of their vision and did not demand surgery. Conclusions: <b>Cataract</b> surgery in <b>complicated</b> cases may be accompanied by complications with uncertain postoperative visual results. Therefore, in patients with <b>complicated</b> <b>cataracts</b> and relatively preserved visual acuity, it is necessary to be careful with proposing surgery and often obey their wish to postpone surgery.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the visual outcomes and complications of unilateral scleral fixation of posterior chamber intraocular lenses (SF-PCIOLs) in pediatric <b>complicated</b> traumatic <b>cataracts</b> without capsular support. Methods: This study involved five eyes of five children who underwent unilateral SF-PCIOL. All patients had a unilateral <b>complicated</b> traumatic <b>cataract</b> associated with anterior or posterior segment injury. Visual acuity (VA), IOL position, and postoperative complications were assessed during follow-up. Results: The mean age of patients at the time of SF-PCIOL was 90 months (range, 66 - 115). The mean duration of follow-up time after surgery was 22 months (range, 5 - 55). In all patients, the best-corrected VA was either improved or was stable at last follow-up following SF-PCIOL implantation. There were no serious complications.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the expression differences of transforming growth factor-β 2 (TGF-β 2), {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (bFGF) and intercellular cell-adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) in lens epithelial cells (LECs) of <b>complicated</b> <b>cataract</b> with silicone oil tamponade and age-related cataract. METHODS: Totally 150 eyes of 150 patients (aged 35 to 77 y) were investigated, including 75 patients with <b>complicated</b> <b>cataract</b> after silicone oil tamponade and 75 patients with age-related cataract. The central piece of anterior capsules was collected during cataract surgery. TGF-β 2, bFGF and ICAM- 1 were {{detected in the}} 60 specimens of the two groups by immunohistochemistry. The expression levels of the three kinds of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) were determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in the 90 specimens of the two groups. RESULTS: TGF-β 2 was detected in the cytomembrane and cytoplasm of the LECs and bFGF was detected in the nucleus. ICAM- 1 was positive in the cytomembrane of the LECs and the distribution of positive cells was uneven. The mRNA genes expression of the TGF-β 2, bFGF and ICAM- 1 was {{significant differences between the two}} groups and markedly increased in <b>complicated</b> <b>cataract</b> group (P< 0. 05).

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the characteristics, {{safety and effectiveness}} of phacoemulsification with <b>complicated</b> <b>cataract</b> after vitrectomy surgery. METHODS:Thirty-nine patients(39 eyes) with <b>complicated</b> <b>cataract</b> after vitrectomy were operated by phacoemulsification, among which 23 eyes after silicon oil tamponade were combined with silicon oil removal. Preoperative and postoperative best corrected visual acuity(BCVA) and complications were recorded. The mean follow-up period was 10 months, with the range from 3 to 24 months. RESULTS:There were no serious surgical complications. Postoperatively, BCVA improved in 37 eyes(95 %), and did not change in 2 eyes(5 %). No decreased visual acuity was observed on the patients. One case had recurrent retinal detachment at two weeks after silicon oil removal, and one case had vitreous hemorrhage at one month. Both eyes were treated with vitrectomy and silicon oil tamponade and were cured. Postoperative complications, such as choroidal hemorrhage, ocular hypotension and so on were not observed.

40|$|Aim. To study immune and {{antioxidant}} {{status of}} diabetic cataract patients {{and to assess}} the efficacy of preoperative preparation for diabetic cataract surgery to prevent intra- and postoperative complications and the efficacy of cataract treatment in metabolic syndrome patients. Patients and methods. 136 cataract patients (272 eyes) were examined (mean age 62 ± 3. 2 years). Among these patients, women predominated (n = 74). Control group included 25 healthy volunteers (10 men and 15 women) aged 32 ‑ 56 (mean age 44. 3 ± 2. 4 years) without ocular diseases (50 eyes). Two patient groups were examined. Group 1 included 78 patients (mean age 54 ± 1. 5) younger than 60 (52. 5 %) with similar lens morphological changes and metabolic disorders who were diagnosed with <b>complicated</b> (diabetic) <b>cataract.</b> Group 2 included 58 patients with age-related cataract. Tear, anterior chamber (AC) humor, and blood tests were performed. Immune status, lipid peroxidation parameters in tear fluid and blood, active peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX 6) and / or its breakdown fragments in tear fluid and AC humor were studied. In group 1 (age-related cataracts), somatic disorders were diagnosed in 4. 5 % of cases, in group 2 (<b>complicated</b> <b>cataracts),</b> somatic disorders were diagnosed in 100 % of cases. Expression of protective enzymes against oxidative stress in tear fluid was studied.

30|$|The {{most common}} causes of visual loss {{in our study}} were {{vitreous}} hemorrhage, <b>complicated</b> <b>cataract,</b> and macular scarring/ inflammation. Vitreous hemorrhage and CME were commonly seen in eyes with retinal vasculitis, macular scarring was mostly associated with MSC, while <b>complicated</b> <b>cataract</b> was mostly seen in panuveitis. The incidence of CME in our study was lower than that reported for uveitis in general, as we had fewer patients with anterior or intermediate uveitis, and fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography were not done routinely in all patients[15 – 17]. Vitreous hemorrhage was treated with retinal photocoagulation or vitreous surgery as required and often resulted in marked improvement in visual acuity. Eyes with MSC also improved markedly after treatment with ATT and corticosteroid therapy. In general, the mean VA across all categories of clinical presentations, improved significantly (p[*]<[*] 0.0001), following ATT and various ancillary treatments. Some eyes with <b>complicated</b> <b>cataract</b> had not received cataract surgery until the last follow-up, indicating that there was further scope of improvement in mean final VA. Thus, our study highlights the effect of ocular complications, the visual morbidity caused by uveitis. Importantly, in epidemiological studies on VI, complications such as cataract and glaucoma attributable to uveitis are often classified separately without the causal diagnosis, leading to falsely low values for uveitis blindness/VI[18].|$|E

Early culture of abscesses was performed, and topical, systemic antimicrobials, or both were given to all patients. Fourteen eyes were operated on in addition to antimicrobial treatment.  RESULTS—The initial culture reports of scleral ulcers identified Pseudomonas species in 12  of these 18  patients, Aspergillus in one, Mycobacterium fortuitum in one, and mixed organisms in four. Subsequent abscess cultures were taken from 15  of the infected eyes, and revealed the same organism as the initial culture in 12.  Associated complications included four serous retinal detachments, three choroidal detachments, two double detachments, five <b>complicated</b> <b>cataracts,</b> and four recurrences of the initial infection. Four eyes required eventual enucleation and 11  eyes regained useful vision.  CONCLUSIONS—With subsequent abscess cultures proving {{to be the same}} organism as found in the initial ulcer, the abscess formation appears to represent intrascleral dissemination. Early diagnosis and appropriate, prolonged topical plus systemic antimicrobial treatment are essential to halt the progression of such severe infections.    Keywords: infectious scleritis; scleral abscess; pterygium excisio...|$|R
40|$|This {{retrospective}} study evaluates {{the long term}} efficacy of pars plana vitrectomy on the preservation of vision in complicated chronic uveitis, including endogenous intermediate uveitis and other entities. Combined vitrectomy-lensectomy was performed in 10 eyes with <b>complicated</b> <b>cataracts,</b> and 18 vitrectomies were done without lensectomies. The mean follow up was 45 months. Additional retinal surgery (for example, scleral buckling) was performed in five eyes. Visual acuity improved in 23 eyes (82. 8 %) following surgery, with 16 eyes (57 %) achieving a vision better than 6 / 24. The main causes for vision less than 6 / 24 were persistent cystoid macular oedema (three eyes), macular puckers (one eye), retinal vascular obliterations (four eyes), optic atrophy (five eyes), and chorioretinal scars (seven eyes). Postoperative complications were cataract formation (seven eyes), cystoid macular oedema (one eye), and tractional retinal detachments (three eyes). The surgical intervention resulted in a remarkable reduction {{of the severity of}} inflammation or frequency of exacerbations, and allowed significant tapering (11 eyes) or withdrawal (11 eyes) of the topical steroids, or oral corticosteroids (10 cases). Pre-existent cystoid macular oedema resolved in three eyes. Pars plana vitrectomy, eventually combined with lensectomy, may visually rehabilitate eyes with chronic uveitis and media opacities, and may reduce the activity of disease postoperatively...|$|R
