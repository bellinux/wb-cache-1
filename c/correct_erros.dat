When n is even, we find every closed, connected subgroup H of G = SO(2,n), such that G/H has a compact Clifford-Klein form, but our classification is not quite complete when n is odd. The work reveals new examples of homogeneous spaces of SO(2,n) that have compact Clifford-Klein forms, if n is even. Furthermore, we show that if H is a closed, connected subgroup of G = SL(3,R), and neither H nor G/H is compact, then G/H does not have a compact Clifford-Klein form, and we also study noncompact Clifford-Klein forms of finite volume.

Expanding our result about the unphysical point x_B=∞, we arrive at an operator product expansion of the nonlocal product of two electromagnetic current operators involving twist-two and -three operators valid to O(α_s) for forward matrix elements. We find that the Wandzura-Wilczek relation between g_ 1 (x_B,Q^ 2) and the twist-two part of g_T(x_B,Q^ 2) is respected in both the singlet and non-singlet sectors at this order, and argue its validity to all orders.

40|$|In a multiorbital {{model of}} the cuprate {{high-temperature}} superconductors soft antiferromagnetic (AF) modes are assumed to reconstruct the Fermi surface to form nodal pockets. The subsequent charge ordering transition leads to a phase with a spatially modulated transfer of charge between neighboring oxygen p_x and p_y orbitals and also weak modulations of the charge density on the copper d_{x^ 2 -y^ 2 } orbitals. As a prime result of the AF Fermi surface reconstruction, the wavevectors of the charge modulations are oriented along the crystalline axes with a periodicity that agrees quantitatively with experiments. This resolves a discrepancy between experiments, which find axial order, and previous theoretical calculations, which find modulation wavevectors along the Brillouin zone (BZ) diagonal. The axial order is stabilized by hopping processes via the Cu 4 s orbital, which is commonly not included in model analyses of cuprate superconductors.

Nevertheless, in 1975 Solovay {{showed that there}} are computable functions f > K+O(1) such that for infinitely many strings σ, f(σ) =K(σ) +O(1), where K denotes prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity (while C denotes plain Kolmogorov complexity). Such an f is now called a Solovay function. We prove that many classical results about K {{can be obtained by}} replacing K by a Solovay function. For example, the three following properties of a function g all hold for the function K. (i) The sum of the terms ∑_n 2 ^-g(n) is a Martin-Löf random real. (ii) A sequence A is Martin-Löf random if and only if C(A n) > n -g(n) -O(1). (iii) A sequence A is K-trivial if and only if K(A n) < g(n) + O(1). We show that when fixing any of these three properties, then among all computable functions exactly the Solovay functions possess this property. Furthermore, this characterization extends accordingly to the larger class of right-c. e. functions. Comment: The abstract of the journal version of this paper is incorrect (item ii).

40|$|QCD {{with two}} {{flavours}} of massless colour-sextet quarks is {{considered as a}} model for conformal/walking Technicolor. If this theory possess an infrared fixed point, as indicated by 2 -loop perturbation theory, it is a conformal(unparticle) field theory. If, on the other hand, a chiral condensate forms on the weak-coupling side of this would-be fixed point, the theory remains confining. The only difference between such a theory and regular QCD {{is that there is a}} range of momentum scales over which the coupling constant runs very slowly (walks). In this first analysis, we simulate the lattice version of QCD with two flavours of staggered quarks at finite temperatures on lattices of temporal extent N_t= 4 and 6. The deconfinement and chiral-symmetry restoration couplings give us a measure of the scales associated with confinement and chiral-symmetry breaking. We find that, in contrast to what is seen with fundamental quarks, these transition couplings are very different. β= 6 /g^ 2 for each of these transitions increases significantly from N_t= 4 and N_t= 6 as expected for the finite temperature transitions of an asymptotically-free theory. This suggests a walking rather than a conformal behaviour, in contrast to what is observed with Wilson quarks. In contrast to what is found for fundamental quarks, the deconfined phase exhibits states in which the Polyakov loop is oriented in the directions of all three cube roots of unity. At very weak coupling the states with complex Polyakov loops undergo a transition to a state with a real, negative Polyakov loop. Comment: 21 pages, 9 figures, Revtex with postscript figures.

40|$|Super-luminous supernovae that radiate {{more than}} 10 ^ 44 ergs per second {{at their peak}} {{luminosity}} have recently been discovered in faint galaxies at redshifts of 0. 1 - 4. Some evolve slowly, resembling models of 'pair-instability' supernovae. Such models involve stars with original masses 140 - 260 {{times that of the}} Sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65 - 30 solar masses. In these stars, the photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted to electron-positron pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclear explosions. Many solar masses of 56 Ni are synthesized; this isotope decays to 56 Fe via 56 Co, powering bright light curves. Such massive progenitors are expected to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early Universe. Recently, supernova 2007 bi in a galaxy at redshift 0. 127 (about 12 billion years after the Big Bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the Sun was observed to look like a fading pair-instability supernova. Here we report observations of two slow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times and blue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability models. Their late-time light-curve and spectral similarities to supernova 2007 bi call the nature of that event into question. Our early spectra closely resemble typical fast-declining super-luminous supernovae, which are not powered by radioactivity. Modelling our observations with 10 - 16 solar masses of magnetar-energized ejecta demonstrates the possibility of a common explosion mechanism. The lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests that their local rate of occurrence is less than 6 x 10 ^- 6 times that of the core-collapse rate.

In the second part of the paper, we will review the fact that the rank conjecture for elliptic curves over function fields is now known to be true, and that the curves which prove this have asymptotically maximal rank for their conductors. The fact that these curves meet rank bounds suggests a number of interesting problems on elliptic curves over number fields, cyclotomic fields, and function fields over number fields.

While penitentes have been suggested as an explanation for anomalous radar data on Europa (Hobley et al. 2013), hitherto no penitentes have been identified conclusively on other planetary bodies. Regular ridges with spacing of 3000 m to 5000 m and a depth of ∼ 500 m with morphologies that resemble penitentes (Fig. 1) have been observed by the New Horizons spacecraft (Moore et al. 2016, Stern et al. 2015, Gladstone et al. 2016, Moore et al. 2017) in the Tartarus Dorsa (TD) region of Pluto (approximately 220 - 250 ^∘ E, 0 - 20 ^∘ N).

While invasive assessments {{have been used to}} study rotational laxity, non-invasive methods are attractive particularly for assessing young cohorts. This study aimed to determine the conditions under which tibio-femoral rotational laxity can be assessed reliably and accurately in a non-invasive manner. The reliability and error of non-invasive examinations of rotational joint laxity were determined by comparing the artefact associated with surface mounted markers against simultaneous measurements using fluoroscopy in five knees including healthy and ACL deficient joints. The knees were examined at 0 °, 30 °, 60 ° and 90 ° flexion using a device that allows manual axial rotation of the joint. With a mean RMS error of 9. 6 °, the largest inaccuracy using non-invasive assessment was present at 0 ° knee flexion, whereas at 90 ° knee flexion, a smaller RMS error of 5. 7 ° was found. A Bland and Altman assessment indicated that a proportional bias exists between the non-invasive and fluoroscopic approaches, with limits of agreement that exceeded 20 °. Correction using average linear regression functions resulted in a reduction of the RMS error to below 1 ° and limits of agreement to less than ± 1 ° across all knees and flexion angles. Given the excellent reliability and the fact that a correction of the surface mounted marker based rotation values can be achieved, non-invasive evaluation of tibio-femoral rotation could offer opportunities for simplified devices for use in clinical settings in cases where invasive assessments are not justified.
