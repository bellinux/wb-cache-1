The tritium-in-urine (HTO plus OBT) was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The doses of tritium-in-urine from participants living at 2, 10 and 22 km were in a range of 1. 26 – 6. 73 Bq/L, 1. 31 – 3. 09 Bq/L and 2. 21 – 3. 81 Bq/L, respectively, while the average activity concentrations of participants from the three groups were 3. 53 ± 1. 62, 2. 09 ± 0. 62 and 2. 97 ± 0. 78 Bq/L, respectively. The personal <b>committed</b> <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> for males were 2. 5 ± 1. 7 nSv and for females they were 2. 9 ± 1. 3 nSv.

40|$|Four {{different}} non-nuclear {{industries have}} been investigated regarding the presence of radioactive elements, with the focus on natural radioactivity. The aim of the studies {{was to investigate the}} flow of radionuclides in the processes and/or to estimate doses to exposed workers. The first industry investigated was phosphate processing in the manufacture of dicalcium phosphate (DCP), which is used as a feed supplement for domestic animals. The phosphate ore used at the plant had an average activity concentration of 837 Bq/kg of 238 U in secular equilibrium with its daughters. Investigation of the flow of radioactivity in the manufacturing process showed several separation and concentration processes. The major part of the uranium was found in the DCP, while the major part of radium was found in the by-product calcium chloride. Estimated doses to workers at the plant from external radiation and dust inhalation were below 1 mSv per year. The second study concerned the removal of radioactivity at a waterworks treating mainly surface water. Apart from natural radioactive elements, also 137 Cs, 90 Sr and 239 + 240 Pu, originating from fallout from atmospheric nuclear weapon tests and the Chernobyl accident, were included in the study. The method used for purification is a combination of coagulation/flocculation and filtration in sand beds. Two different coagulants are used, FeCl 3 and Al 2 (SO 4) 3. The results for both coagulants showed high removal efficiencies for uranium, thorium, polonium and plutonium, while radium, strontium and caesium passed through the process and could therefore subsequently reach the municipal distribution network with almost unchanged activity concentrations. The third investigation is a study of exposure to thorium during TIG-welding with thoriated tungsten electrodes. Breathing zone samples were collected for welders at five different workshops. Breathing zone samples from electrode grinding were collected at the laboratory. Dose assessments were made based on both realistic and conservative assumptions showing that, in the realistic case, the annual <b>committed</b> <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> were below 0. 3 mSv for welding and 10 microSv for grinding. Based on conservative assumptions the annual <b>committed</b> <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> were around 1 mSv or lower for welding and about 60 microSv for grinding. The fourth study concerned the use of zircon in the ceramics industry. Zircon is used as an ingredient (about 10 % by weight) in glaze, and samples collected from three different plants contained 3, 000 to 3, 900 Bq/kg of the uranium series elements and 470 to 740 Bq/kg of thorium series elements. The estimated annual <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> to exposed workers were low, below 90 microSv.

The daily urinary excretion to <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> conversion factors for ingestion and inhalation were evaluated based on the ICRP and L&E models for members of the public. The ingestion (inhalation) <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> per unit intake integrated over one day is 1. 7  ×  10 − 8 (1. 4  ×  10 − 7)  Sv Bq− 1, 2. 0  ×  10 − 7 (9. 6  ×  10 − 7)  Sv Bq− 1 over 10  days, 5. 2  ×  10 − 7 (2. 0  ×  10 − 6) Sv Bq− 1 over 30  days and 1. 0  ×  10 − 6 (3. 0  ×  10 − 6) Sv Bq− 1 over 100  days. The daily urinary excretions after acute ingestion (inhalation) of 1  Bq of 210 Po are 1. 1  ×  10 − 3 (1. 0  ×  10 − 4) on day  1, 2. 0  ×  10 − 3 (1. 9  ×  10 − 4) on day  10, 1. 3  ×  10 − 3 (1. 7  ×  10 − 4) on day  30 and 3. 6  ×  10 − 4 (8. 3  ×  10 − 5) Bq d− 1 on day  100, respectively. The resulting <b>committed</b> <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> range from 2. 1  ×  10 − 3 to 1. 7  ×  10 − 2  mSv by an assumption of ingestion and from 5. 5  ×  10 − 2 to 4. 5  ×  10 − 1  mSv by inhalation. For the case of Mr. Litvinenko, the mean organ absorbed dose as a function of time was calculated using both the above stated models. The red bone marrow, the kidneys and the liver were considered as the critical organs. Assuming a value of lethal absorbed dose of 5  Gy to the bone marrow, 6  Gy to the kidneys and 8  Gy to the liver, the amount of 210 Po which Mr. Litvinenko might have ingested is therefore estimated to range from 27 to 1, 408  MBq, i. e 0. 2 – 8. 5  μg, depending on the modality of intake and on different assumptions about blood absorption...|$|R
40|$|The iodine {{activity}} {{taken up}} by thyroid is measured by a collimated 7. 6 x 7. 6 cm NaI crystal, usually following an Iodine incident. To perform a dose assessment of the subject, the ICRP biokinetic retention model, given in ICRP 54 publication, is applied to estimate the activity intake in thyroid and whole boy. The dose/activity conversion factors from ICRP 68 are then applied to obtain the corresponding <b>committed</b> <b>doses</b> (<b>effective</b> & equivalent) of the subject. The 5 um AMAD for inhalation route is applied in most cases. Follow up measurements are usually carried out when the Intake exceeds 5 kBq. The results are then compared with the predicted dose by the biokinetic model; adjustment to the model is applied to fit the measured data of individual (if required). The ICRP biokinetic model provides a satisfactory estimate to all encountered cases. Los Alamos National Laboratory; Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute...|$|R
