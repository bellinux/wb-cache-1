2500|$|Joseph M. Smoot hitched a {{ride from}} lawyer Hank Greenspun {{to get from}} New York City in the eastern United States to Las Vegas. He claimed to have helped build tracks in California and Florida {{which turned out to}} be untrue. The track was built to be a major horse racing {{facility}} on the south side of Las Vegas.

Smoot and two others were charged with felony embezzlement after he could not provide receipts for missing $500,000. A trustee was appointed by a federal judge to run the track. Smoot remained indicted until he was found dead in a hotel room two years later.|$|E
