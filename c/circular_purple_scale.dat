50|$|The olive sea snake swims using a paddle-like tail. It has {{brownish}} and <b>purple</b> <b>scales</b> {{along the}} top of its body whilst its underside is a white color. It can grow up to a meter in length, and in some cases up to two meters. While it can be aggressive towards prey, attacks on divers or larger animals are usually rare, though if provoked it will engage the attacker. The snake's main predators are sharks and ospreys.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 17.5 mm. The forewings are creamy-white, profusely sprinkled with <b>purple</b> <b>scales.</b> The {{base of the}} costal margin and the outer third of the wing are more thickly covered than {{the remainder of the}} wing, so that the ground colour is partially obliterated. A narrow orange-ochreous border runs around the apex and apical margin {{at the base of the}} purplish-grey fringes. The hindwings are grey, with pale ochreous fringes tipped with shining grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{antennae}} {{are dark}} brown. The labial palpi are light brown {{on the inside}} and strongly mottled with blackish scales on the outside. The tuft on the second joint is small, while the terminal joint is thickened with rough scales anteriorly. The head and thorax are light ochreous brown. The ground color of the forewings is rather light brown, but thickly overlaid on the costal three fourths with deep brown and dark <b>purple</b> <b>scales,</b> obscuring the ground color except along the dorsal edge. The hindwings are silvery fuscous and the legs are dark purplish fuscous.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 10 mm. The forewings are reddish brown and the costa white with two lobes of white reaching {{down to the}} fold, the first narrow, pointed obliquely outward and the other large and triangular. At {{the beginning of the}} cilia is a costal white spot and opposite it a dorsal one. On the fold beyond the middle is a small white dot.

The forewings are pale straw-colour, with a pale ferruginous shade obliquely parallel to {{and near the}} apical margin, extending to the apex, but not quite to the anal angle, containing bright bluish <b>purple</b> metallic <b>scales</b> throughout its length. There is a ferruginous elongate discal spot about {{the middle of the}} wing, also containing some bright bluish <b>purple</b> metallic <b>scales.</b> Between this discal spot and the anal angle is a faint streak of ferruginous-brown scales, another slight streak of the same colour beyond the middle of the cell, reaching to the dark marginal shade.

The bark on young trees is smooth and gray with resin blisters, becoming red-brown, rough and fissured on old trees. The leaves are needle-like, 1-3.5 cm long, glaucous blue-green above and below with strong stomatal bands, and a blunt to notched tip. They are arranged spirally on the shoot, but twisted slightly s-shaped to be upcurved above the shoot. The cones are erect, 11 - 22 cm long, with the <b>purple</b> <b>scales</b> almost completely hidden by the long exserted yellow-green bract scales; ripening brown and disintegrating to release the winged seeds in fall.|$|R
40|$|Seeing George" is ‘a fairytale for adults’ by Cassandra Austin. The George of {{the title}} is a dragon – oddly, named after the famous dragon-slayer. You would think he would find it {{convenient}} {{that most of the}} people he lives among in Melbourne in the 1950 s don’t see him as a dragon, but as a man. But he is lonely and disconsolate until he meets a young woman, Violet, whose reaction of horror gratifies his sense of self: she sees him in his true colours – green and <b>purple</b> <b>scales,</b> tail, fiery breath and all. Violet is not so delighted, however, and with reason. Her marriage is already proving a little troublesome, and she doesn’t need the extra complication of a lovesick dragon, who looks like a normal man to her husband, hanging around and claiming her attention. She, and others, begin to have doubts about her sanity...|$|R
50|$|The cones are erect; cylindrical; 1.4 to 2.75 inches (3.5-7 cm) long, rarely 3.2 in (8 cm), and 1-1.2 inches (2.5-3 cm) broad, rarely 1.5 in (4 cm) broad; dark purple, turning pale brown when mature; often resinous; {{and with}} long reflexed green, yellow, or pale <b>purple</b> bract <b>scales.</b> The cones {{disintegrate}} when mature at 4-6 months old {{to release the}} winged seeds.|$|R
40|$|The angular and {{spectral}} reflectance of single scales of five different butterfly species was measured {{and related to}} the scale anatomy. The scales of the pierids Pieris rapae and Delias nigrina scatter white light randomly, {{in close agreement with}} Lambert’s cosine law, which can be well understood from the randomly organized beads on the scale crossribs. The reflectance of the iridescent blue scales of Morpho aega is determined by multilayer structures in the scale ridges, causing diffraction in approximately a plane. The <b>purple</b> <b>scales</b> in the dorsal wing tips of the male Colotis regina act similarly as the Morpho scale in the blue, due to multilayers in the ridges, but the scattering in the red occurs as in the Pieris scale, because the scales contain beads with pigment that does not absorb in the red wavelength range. The green–yellow scales of Urania fulgens backscatter light in a narrow spatial angle, because of a multilayer structure in the scale body. ...|$|R
50|$|The Mexican {{golden trout}} is sexually dimorphic, males {{can easily be}} {{identified}} from females due to their much longer jaws or kype. Mexican golden trout are brightly colored with blue parr marks on {{both males and females}} {{along the side of the}} body. <b>Purple</b> <b>scaling</b> is visible along the lateral line. Both sexes also have bright golden-yellow belly coloration. The top of the fish and the tailfin are covered in small black spots with much larger spotting on the dorsal fin. The pectoral fins, pelvic fin and anal fin are light orange in color with white tips. Due to their harsh and small stream habitat the Mexican golden trout remains small even when fully grown. Adults rarely reach over a foot long with the maximum size probably being 10 inches (25 cm). Overall body shape and fin placement nearly identical to Rainbow trout Parr marks usually remain distinct throughout the fish's life.|$|R

40|$|ASC code teams {{require a}} robust {{software}} debugging tool to help developers quickly find bugs in their codes {{and get their}} codes running. Development debugging commonly runs up to 512 processes. Production jobs run up to full ASC <b>Purple</b> <b>scale,</b> and at times require introspection while running. Developers want a debugger that runs on all their development and production platforms and that works with all compilers and runtimes used with ASC codes. The TotalView Multiprocess Debugger made by Etnus was specified for ASC Purple to address this needed capability. The ASC Purple environment builds on the environment seen by TotalView on ASCI White. The debugger must now operate with the Power 5 CPU, Federation switch, AIX 5. 3 operating system including large pages, IBM compilers 7 and 9, POE 4. 2 parallel environment, and rs 6000 SLURM resource manager. Users require robust, basic debugger functionality with acceptable performance at development debugging scale. A TotalView installation must be provided {{at the beginning of}} the early user access period that meets these requirements. A functional enhancement, fast conditional data watchpoints, and a scalability enhancement, capability up to 8192 processes, are to be demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNear-infrared {{spectroscopy}} and microstructure of {{the scales}} of Sabethes (Sabethes) albiprivus (Diptera: Culicidae). Sabethes (Sabethes) albiprivus Theobald individuals vary considerably in size and color of the reflections {{of the scales}} on their thorax, abdomen, antepronotal lobes and occiput. The goal {{of this study was}} to investigate and to characterize the differences in the color of the scales among preserved specimens and to analyze the differences in the microstructures of the scales that cover their bodies using near-infrared spectroscopy, and to evaluate whether the latter is efficient in distinguishing the populations. A total of 201 adult females were analyzed for the characterization of color patterns. In addition, absorbance spectra and scanning electron microscope images were obtained from them. As a result of color analysis, two variations were identified, one represented by specimens with yellow or green scales and the other with blue or <b>purple</b> <b>scales.</b> The same two variations were corroborated using NIRS. Analysis of the microstructure of the scales lining the mesonotum, occiput and antepronotal lobes resulted in the same variations. The three methodologies, near-infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and coloration of the reflections of the scales revealed two variations within Sa. albiprivus...|$|R
