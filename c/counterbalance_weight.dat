5|$|Construction of a {{connection}} between the river and the Trent and Mersey Canal was begun in 1871 and completed in 1875. Because of the difference in level, a vertical boat lift was designed by Edwin Clark, using counterbalanced tanks which were linked by a hydraulic system. A descending tank caused hydraulic fluid to enter the pistons which raised the other tank. The design was a success, but the fluid became contaminated, resulting in corrosion of the pistons. The lift was replaced by a new design, where each tank was attached to its own <b>counterbalance</b> <b>weight</b> by wire ropes and pulleys, with small electric motors to overcome friction. The new lift was built {{over the top of the}} old one, so that it could continue to be used until the new one was ready, and the work was carried out by staff of the Navigation, supervised by the engineer J A Saner. It was completed in 1906, and continued in use until 1983, when it was closed on safety grounds due to corrosion.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} the Fairbanks Scale, the {{platform}} scale is a benched scale for measuring the <b>counterbalance</b> <b>weight</b> of loaded objects at ground level, thus eliminating {{the use of a}} hoist. After a series of trial and error in his designs, Thaddeus Fairbanks patented his invention in 1830. E & T Fairbanks & Company, a business partnership between Thaddeus and his brother, Erastus Fairbanks, exported their famous scales around the world to exotic locations such as England, China, Cuba, Russia, and India due to the high demand.|$|E

50|$|The engine had its {{cylinders}} cast {{together with}} the upper crankcase and featured a four-bearing crankshaft with <b>counterbalancing</b> <b>weights.</b> The big end bearings were flanged over {{the sides of the}} crankshaft to locate the rods against the crank webs, which reduced engine noise.|$|R
5000|$|These were {{intended}} for use in Operation Herkules, the planned but never-executed Italo-German invasion of Malta. Ten of them were specially modified to each carry a captured Russian KV-1 or KV-2 heavy tank.

25|$|An {{alternative}} design used <b>counterbalance</b> <b>weights</b> {{to raise}} the fort. This allowed the fort to be raised by the physical strength of the garrison. This design had two access hatches and, with a slightly larger underground chamber {{and the elimination of}} the central pneumatic ram the fort could have a crew of four men. Under consideration in late 1940, this alternative design was not used in significant numbers and only about a dozen were installed.|$|R

50|$|In 1880 {{the ferry}} was still using chains, {{replaced}} by cables between 1878 and 1887. They are first seen in pictures of Floating Bridge No. 7, built in 1892 by Day, Summers and Co. Each rope weighed nearly 2 tons {{and had an}} average life of nine months in normal use. Each end was attached to a short length of chain that was connected to <b>counterbalance</b> <b>weights</b> housed in chain wells to maintain tension. As the ropes stretched with use, chain links were removed to compensate.|$|R
50|$|On 4 October 1992, an El Al Boeing 747-F cargo {{aircraft}} (Flight 1862) {{crashed into}} an apartment building in Amsterdam. Local residents and rescue workers complained of various unexplained health issues, which were being attributed {{to the release of}} hazardous materials during the crash and subsequent fires. Authorities conducted an epidemiological study in 2000 of those believed to be affected by the accident. The study concluded that there was no evidence to link depleted uranium (used as <b>counterbalance</b> <b>weights</b> on the elevators of the plane) to any of the reported health complaints.|$|R

Most such saws have a method to allow the cutting force to be adjusted, such as a movable <b>counterbalancing</b> <b>weight,</b> a coil spring with a {{screw-thread}} adjustment, or a hydraulic or pneumatic damper (speed control valve). The latter does not force the blade downwards, but rather simply limits {{the speed at which}} the saw can fall, preventing excessive feed on thin or soft parts.

No Ordnance 25-pr Mk 2 on Carriage 25-pr Mark 1 were lost in France. This gun fired all charges, 1 - 3 and Super.In 1942 a muzzle brake was fitted to the gun to eliminate the instability caused when firing the 20 lb AP shell with Charge Super at direct fire low elevation angles. To preserve the gun's balance on the trunnions a <b>counterbalance</b> <b>weight</b> was also fitted, {{just in front of the}} breech ring. The designation of the modified gun was not changed.

This manipulator system allows for testing of new adaptive control schemes that have been developed for efficient reduction of settling time in space operation. The design criterion is maximal distance between the imaginary axis of the systems root locus and the closest pole to it.

5000|$|After {{the initial}} launch the Numark units {{received}} mixed reviews, with several flaws and inadequate quality assurance being pointed out. Some found the tonearm as supplied was not accurately calibrated or properly {{aligned with the}} platter, {{but it can be}} tweaked and adjusted to perform well. The platter in some cases exhibited noticeable warp or axial run-out, which appears to be in part due to the ceramic ring magnetic that secures the platter to the spindle not being glued correctly to the underside of the platter. Some reviewers complained that the pitch system was not calibrated accurately, although not off by much. On later production models, probably the Pro TT-2 only, it is reported that access holes are provided {{on the bottom of the}} turntable base to permit pitch calibration using a screwdriver. Others considered the LCD display to be of little practical value since the pitch value shown is not precise. Also, in some cases the stylus pressure ring on the tonearm <b>counterbalance</b> <b>weight</b> assembly turns much too freely. And, unfortunately, the dust cover hinges eventually fail due to cracking at the bottom of the plastic housing for the counterbalance spring which is under the constant load of the stiff spring. One failed hinge keeps the dust cover from staying open when raised.|$|E
40|$|When using {{accelerator}} beams {{for cancer}} therapy, the three-dimensional freedom afforded by a gantry helps the treatment planner {{to spread out}} surface doses, avoid directions that intercept vital organs and irradiate a volume that is conformal with the tumour. The general preference is for an iso-centric gantry turning 360 ° in the vertical plane around the patient bed with sufficient space {{to be able to}} orientate the patient through 360 ° in the horizontal plane. For hadrontherapy, gantries are impressive structures of the order of 10 m in diameter and 100 tons in weight and to date only proton gantries have been demonstrated to operate satisfactorily. The increased magnetic rigidity of say carbon ions will make ion gantries more difficult and costly to build. For this reason, exo-centric gantries and, in particular the so-called 'Riesenrad' gantry with a single 90 ° bending magnet, merit further attention. The power consumption is reduced and the heavy magnets with their <b>counterbalance</b> <b>weight</b> are reduced and are kept close to the axis. The treatment room, which is lighter, is positioned at a larger radius, but only the patient bed requires careful alignment. An optics module called a 'rotator' is needed to match an incoming dispersion vector to the gantry in order to have an achromatic beam at the patient. A practical design is described that assumes the beam is derived from a slow-extraction scheme in a synchrotron and that the beam sizes are controlled by modules in the transfer line. Magnetic scanning is integrated into the gantry optics for both transverse directions...|$|E
5000|$|Many [...] "tuning" [...] firms {{producing}} [...] "billet" [...] cranks misunderstand {{the design}} criteria of <b>counterbalance</b> <b>weights.</b> They produce cranks that although made from better materials lack sufficient counter weights and deflect more than OEM standard at high rpm. Other [...] "tuning" [...] firms offer [...] "lightening" [...] and [...] "knife edging" [...] of OEM cranks, this is largely {{at the expense}} of the <b>counterbalance</b> <b>weights.</b> To restore the couple and reduce crankshaft deflection back to OEM spec further work has to undertaken, either installing slugs of high density metal (tungsten) in the counterweights or core drilling the big end journals. For both billet and re-worked OEM cranks if the deflection is greater than OEM spec the results will be poor fatigue and bearing life. For worst cases this may require frequent engine tear downs to replace bearing shells when the crank rubs on the bearing and seasonal replacement of the crank. All of the rotating couple due to crank throw and rotating portion of con-rod and 1/2 the reciprocating couple should be countered. As the balance mass is dependent on the mass of the piston and con-rods if these are changed (for lighter after-market items) then the effect on the couple should be calculated and corrected. Any reputable maker of billet or re-worked cranks should be able to either specify the weights of con-rods and pistons or correct the crank counter weights to suit con-rods and pistons.|$|R

50|$|A {{rotating}} system of mass is in dynamic balance when the rotation {{does not produce}} any resultant centrifugal force or couple. The system rotates without requiring the application of any external force or couple, other than that required to support its weight. If a system is initially unbalanced, to avoid the stress upon the bearings caused by the centrifugal couple, <b>counterbalancing</b> <b>weights</b> must be added.This is seen when a bicycle wheel gets buckled. The wheel will not rotate itself when stationary due to gravity as it is still statically balanced, but will not rotate smoothly as the centre of mass is {{to the side of}} the centre bearing. The spokes on a bike wheel need to be tuned in order to stop this and keep the wheel operating as efficiently as possible.|$|R

5000|$|The {{operator}} wears a harness—the Steadicam vest—which {{is attached}} to an iso-elastic arm. This is connected by a multiaxis and ultra-low friction gimbal to the Steadicam [...] "sled" [...] which has the camera mounted {{at one end and}} <b>counterbalancing</b> <b>weight</b> (the monitor and batteries) at the other. The monitor substitutes for the camera's viewfinder, since the range of motion of the camera relative to the operator makes the camera's own viewfinder unusable. In the film industry the armature and weight are traditionally called the sled, as the two units combined resembled a sled in an early model of the Steadicam. The sled includes the top stage where the camera is attached, the post which in most models can be extended, with the monitor and batteries at the bottom to <b>counterbalance</b> the camera <b>weight.</b> This is how the Steadicam stays upright, by simply making the bottom slightly heavier than the top, pivoting at the gimbal. This leaves the center of gravity of the whole rig, however heavy it may be, exactly at the operator's fingertip, allowing deft and finite control of the whole system with the lightest of touches on the gimbal. The skill of the operator is to keep the desired framing and composition by feathering his touch on the gimbal, while the rig and operator is in motion, and, indeed, when still.|$|R
