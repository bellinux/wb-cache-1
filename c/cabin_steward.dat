25|$|<b>Cabin</b> <b>Steward</b> Fuji Hachitaro, USN, November 5, 1889.|$|E
25|$|On Monday, October 7, 1985, four PLF militants hijacked Achille Lauro off Egypt. The hijackers {{had been}} {{surprised}} by a crew member and acted prematurely. The Palestinians had hidden their weapons in the gas tank of a car parked in Italian in preparation for boarding the ship. Their smuggled weapons still with gasoline residue on them, gave off a smell that the crew had noticed but had not acted on. A <b>cabin</b> <b>steward,</b> with the hijackers' stateroom in his responsibilities, surprised the four Palestinians (as {{they were trying to}} use a hairdryer to clean the residue off their weapons) by entering the unlocked door to their room in order to deliver complimentary fruit. The hijackers plan to launch an attack on Ashdod, Israel was put aside as the terrorists panicked and moved to hijack the ship instead.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after Eden's resignation, he and Lady Avon {{sailed to}} New Zealand {{for a further}} break. Their <b>cabin</b> <b>steward,</b> on what she {{described}} as [...] "the hellship Rangitata", was the future Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott. Half a century later Prescott recalled that, while kneeling down to clean the ship's brass, he had occasion to admire a pair of legs {{that turned out to}} be Lady Eden's – [...] "You naturally look, don't you" [...] – whereupon Sir Anthony tapped him on the head. When they arrived in New Zealand, which was among the few countries publicly to have supported the Suez operation, the Edens received a rapturous [...] "red carpet" [...] reception.|$|E

50|$|Two <b>cabin</b> <b>stewards</b> {{working on}} a luxury vessel on a Mediterranean cruise to Tangier attempt to earn extra money from the {{passengers}} using every possible means. However, {{when one of the}} wealthy dowagers has her valuable diamond necklace stolen, they {{do everything they can to}} ensure it is restored to her.|$|R
5000|$|At the stoppover in Lisbon a new {{crew was}} charged with the aircraft. The five-member crew {{consisted}} of Captain Viktor Orlov, co-pilot Vasily Shevelev, navigator Anatoly Vorobyov, flight engineer Yuri Suslov and radio operator Evhen Pankov. The five <b>cabin</b> <b>stewards</b> were as follows; Galina Grigorieva, Polishchuk Lyudmila, Eugene Kvasnikova, Tamara Galkin and Vladimir Rukotov. [...] The only two survivors of the crash were a West German woman and a Soviet man. One of the victims was José Carlos Schwarz, a poet and musician from Guinea-Bissau. Another was the Australian solicitor and Aboriginal Legal Service pioneer Peter Tobin.|$|R
2500|$|Passengers were in {{the dining}} hall {{when there was a}} sudden, loud bang, which a crew member (speaking over the intercom) {{ascribed}} to an [...] "electrical failure". [...] "We told the guests everything was [...] and under control and we tried to stop them panicking", a <b>cabin</b> <b>steward</b> recalled. Coincidentally, when the ship first made impact with the rock, it was claimed that Titanics theme song [...] "My Heart Will Go On" [...] was playing in a restaurant. The ship lost cabin electrical power shortly after the initial collision. [...] "The boat started shaking. The noise—there was panic, like in a film, dishes crashing to the floor, people running, people falling down the stairs," [...] said a survivor. Those on board said the ship suddenly tilted to the port side. Passengers were later advised to put on their life jackets.|$|E
2500|$|On the 25th {{anniversary of}} the crash, Peter Otzen Jnr, the son {{of one of the}} victims, {{announced}} that he was approaching the South African Constitutional Court in an attempt to have the commission of inquiry into the disaster reopened. In pursuit of this, he has obtained affidavits from former SAA employees who had never before given evidence. An Australian, Allan Dexter, had given a sworn statement to Mr. Otzen claiming that he had been informed by the SAA Manager at Taipei airport that the Helderberg was carrying rocket fuel, which caused it to crash. A second affidavit secured by Mr. Otzen was sworn by former Chief <b>Cabin</b> <b>Steward</b> Willem Bothma, who claimed that when he was in Taipei on 28 November 1987, the day of the crash, he received a telex from the SAA CEO Gert van der Veer which read [...] "Seize all cargo documents related to SA295. No one to see it." [...] This would be standard airline practice after a crash. Both of these received coverage in the Sunday Times, a national publication in South Africa.|$|E
60|$|The {{boy would}} permit none but himself to wheel her, {{and with his}} own hands {{assisted}} her from the chair to the interior of their stateroom--and {{that was the last}} that was seen of the old lady by the ship's company until the pair disembarked. The boy even insisted upon doing the work of their <b>cabin</b> <b>steward,</b> since, as he explained, his grandmother was suffering from a nervous disposition that made the presence of strangers extremely distasteful to her.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the late}} 18th century, {{merchant}} seamen and dockworkers have worn denim flared trousers, striped undershirts, knitted roll neck jumpers, and short blue peacoats. This basic outfit, {{paired with a}} thick leather belt, flat cap and clogs, was also a mark of identification for {{turn of the century}} criminal gangs such as the Scuttlers.On the more luxurious cruise ships and ocean liners, deckhands wore neatly pressed dress blues {{similar to those of the}} Royal Navy and USN, while waiters and <b>cabin</b> <b>stewards</b> wore white uniforms with a band collar, gilded brass buttons, and a gold stripe on the trouser leg. In wet weather, sailors wore oilskins and Souwesters, but contemporary fishermen generally wear a two piece yellow or orange waterproof jacket and trousers. Modern updates to the traditional look include polar fleeces, hoodies, baseball caps, and knit caps. Straw hats, sailor caps and tarred waterproof hats are no longer in widespread civilian use, but wool or denim versions of the Greek fisherman's cap remain common.|$|R
60|$|A {{surge of}} the trunk threw him across the <b>cabin</b> as the <b>steward</b> {{answered}} my bell. I wrote my requisition to the doctor while Shend was struggling to his feet.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Sir George {{is at the}} island, my lady,’ said he: ‘for which, {{with your}} ladyship’s permission, I shall {{immediately}} make all sail. The <b>cabins</b> are prepared. <b>Steward,</b> take Lady Greville below.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, now, I'll {{explain this}} business, and you'll see, once for all, just {{precisely}} how much lark {{there is to}} it," [...] said Davis. [...] "I'm captain, and I'm going to be it. One thing of three. First, you take my orders here as <b>cabin</b> <b>steward,</b> {{in which case you}} mess with us. Or, second, you refuse, and I pack you forward--and you get as quick as the word's said. Or, third and last, I'll signal that man-of-war and send you ashore under arrest for mutiny." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, there, Sir Gervaise I doesn't {{agree with}} you the least bit; for I thinks as a ship's steward--I mean a <b>cabin</b> <b>steward,</b> and a good 'un of the quality--might do {{a great deal of}} {{improvement}} in this very house. The cook and I has had a partic'lar dialogue on them matters, already; and I mentioned to her the names of seven different dishes, every one of which she quite as good as admitted to me, was just the same as so much gospel to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|But I have a {{story of}} my own to tell about these rats. One day the <b>cabin</b> <b>steward</b> made me a present of some molasses, which I was so choice of that I kept it hid away in a tin can in the {{farthest}} corner of my bunk.. Faring as we did, this molasses dropped upon a biscuit was a positive luxury, which I shared with none but the doctor, and then only in private. And sweet as the treacle was, how could bread thus prepared and eaten in secret be otherwise than pleasant? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That'll do, Jack; that'll do, my honest fellow. Go below, {{and tell}} Josh {{to take you}} into the <b>cabin</b> again, as <b>steward's</b> mate. You're rather too Dutch built, in your old age, to do much aloft." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{was no time}} to ask questions, and Neal obeyed at once, observing as {{he entered}} the <b>cabin</b> that the <b>stewards</b> were {{collecting}} food and such other things as might be needed in case they were forced to depend upon the frail crafts.|$|R
60|$|Although it {{was early}} in the afternoon, it became almost as dark as night in the <b>cabin.</b> The <b>steward</b> had brought him a glass of hot grog, {{as soon as he}} had changed his clothes and, in spite of the din, he {{presently}} fell off to sleep. When he woke the rain had ceased; but the uproar caused by the howling of the wind, the creaking of the spars, and the dashing of the waves was as loud as before.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] he said, {{twisting}} {{his cigar}} {{in his mouth}} and toying with the spokes of the wheel. [...] "I'm Captain Brown. I command this ship. This is Mr. Hay, first officer. The other white man is <b>cabin</b> <b>steward,</b> but he'll stand watch and do his trick. My orders shall be obeyed smartly. You savvy, 'smartly'? There shall be no growling about the kaikai, which will be above allowance. You'll put a handle to the mate's name, and tack on 'sir' to every order I give you. If you're smart and quick, I'll make this ship comfortable for all hands." [...] He took the cigar out of his mouth. [...] "If you're not," [...] he added, in a roaring voice, [...] "I'll make it a floating hell.--Now, Mr. Hay, we'll pick watches, if you please." ...|$|E
60|$|In the {{meantime}} Nat had gone below {{with the two}} midshipmen. The accommodation for officers was excellent. There was a large cabin aft which had been handsomely fitted up by the late captain. Off this on one side was his state-room, on the other those for the two officers; beyond these were the steward's cabin and pantry on one side, and a spare cabin which {{had been given to}} the quarter-master on the other. Nat had engaged a negro as cook, and his son, a lad of seventeen or eighteen, as <b>cabin</b> <b>steward,</b> and had sent on board a small stock of wines. He ordered the boy to open a bottle and to put glasses on the table, and they drank together {{to the success of the}} cruise. They had just finished when the quarter-master came down.|$|E
60|$|The {{terms of}} the capitulation--and they {{differed}} but little from surrendering at discretion--were no sooner agreed to, than our people were ordered into the forecastle, whence they were transferred to the boats, in readiness to be sent ashore. All the chests, and private effects, were moved out, in the most honourable manner, and sent into la Pauline's boats, which lay prepared to receive them. As for us officers, we were put in the gig, Neb and the <b>cabin</b> <b>steward</b> being charged with the duty of looking after our private property. When everybody, the blacks excepted, was in a boat, we shoved off, and proceeded towards the landing, as chop-fallen and melancholy a party as ever took possession of a newly-discovered country. Marble affected to whistle, for he was secretly furious at the nonchalance manifested by Captain Le Compte; but I detected him in getting parts of Monny Musk and the Irish Washerwoman, into the same strain. To own the truth, the ex-mate was morally much disturbed. As for myself, I considered the affair as an incident of war, and cared much less.|$|E
6000|$|By {{this time}} we were seated in the <b>cabin</b> and the <b>steward</b> brought in a tray with a bottle and glasses. [...] "Thanks! No." [...] Never took liquor. Would have some water, though. He drank two tumblerfuls. Terrible thirsty work. Ever since {{daylight}} had been exploring the islands round his ship.|$|R
5000|$|While by the refit in 1916 back to {{a general}} cargo vessel the {{superstructure}} had been changed back {{to little more than}} a Forecastle Mess Room, a <b>Stewards</b> <b>Cabin,</b> an Engineers Cabin and an Officers Cabin. The Length of Engine Room had been shortened from 37 ft to 30 ft ...|$|R
60|$|By half-past {{seven in}} the morning, the ship being then inside the harbour at last and moored within a long stone's-throw from the quay, my stock of {{philosophy}} was nearly exhausted. I was dressing hurriedly in my <b>cabin</b> when the <b>steward</b> came tripping in with a morning suit over his arm.|$|R
6000|$|... --One, {{from about}} {{eighteen}} to nineteen years, named José, and this [...] {{was the man}} that waited upon his master, Don Alexandro, and who [...] speaks well the Spanish, having served him four or five years; * * [...] * a mulatto, named Francesco, the <b>cabin</b> <b>steward,</b> of a good person [...] and voice, having sung in the Valparaiso churches, native of the [...] province of Buenos Ayres, aged about thirty-five years. * * * A [...] smart negro, named Dago, who had been for many years a [...] grave-digger among the Spaniards, aged forty-six years. * * * Four [...] old negroes, born in Africa, from sixty to seventy, but sound, [...] calkers by trade, whose names are as follows:--the first was named [...] Muri, and he was killed (as was also his son named Diamelo); the [...] second, Nacta; the third, Yola, likewise killed; the fourth, [...] Ghofan; and six full-grown negroes, aged from thirty to [...] forty-five, all raw, and born among the Ashantees--Matiluqui, Yan, [...] Leche, Mapenda, Yambaio, Akim; four of whom were killed; * * * a [...] powerful negro named Atufal, who being {{supposed to have been}} a [...] chief in Africa, his owner set great store by him. * * * And a [...] small negro of Senegal, but some years among the Spaniards, aged [...] about thirty, which negro's name was Babo; * * * that he does not [...] remember the names of the others, but that still expecting the [...] residue of Don Alexandra's papers will be found, will then take [...] due account of them all, and remit to the court; * * * and [...] thirty-nine women and children of all ages.|$|E

5000|$|Independently, in {{the former}} colonies, the term {{had come to be}} applied to baker's young apprentices, i.e. [...] "dough-boys". The New World version of doughboy was a {{linguistic}} cousin to [...] "dough-head", a colloquialism for stupidity in 19th Century America. In Moby-Dick (1851), Herman Melville nicknamed the timorous <b>cabin</b> <b>steward</b> [...] "Doughboy." ...|$|E

[...] {{cried the}} hearty voice of Captain Truck, {{who had taken}} {{possession}} {{of what he called}} his throne in the <b>cabin.</b> All the <b>steward's</b> elegant diction and finish of demeanour vanished at the well-known sound, and thrusting his head out of the pantry-door, he gave the prompt ship-answer to a call, ...|$|R
50|$|She thought {{getting into}} a {{lifeboat}} {{was a waste of}} time. She left her two sisters on the deck to return to her cabin. In her <b>cabin,</b> a <b>steward</b> informed her that her mother had gone on deck. The steward escorted her to lifeboat 10, just as it was being lowered. She jumped into the lifeboat. The people in the boat caught her. By the time Titanic went down their lifeboat was a mile away from the site. The thought of Charles floundering in the water while crying out for help stayed with her {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|R
60|$|Like {{many other}} great men, Mr. Coulson {{was not without}} his weakness. He was brave, shrewd, and far-seeing. He enjoyed {{excellent}} health, and he scarcely knew {{the meaning of the}} word nerves. Nevertheless he suffered from seasickness. The first thing he did, therefore, when aboard the boat at Boulogne, was to bespeak a private <b>cabin.</b> The <b>steward</b> to whom he made his application shook his head with regret. The last two had just been engaged. Mr. Coulson tried a tip, and then a larger tip, with equal lack of success. He was about to abandon the effort and retire gloomily to the saloon, when a man who had been standing by, wrapped in a heavy fur overcoat, intervened.|$|R
50|$|On 4 August 1919, Martha Washington {{departed}} New York City {{bound for}} Brest, France, {{on the first}} leg of a voyage that was ultimately to take her to Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire. On the evening of 10 August 1919, when Castle did not arrive at the scheduled time for dinner, his orderly and <b>cabin</b> <b>steward</b> found the door to the bathroom in his cabin locked. When repeated calls and knocking failed to arouse a response from within his cabin, the orderly and <b>cabin</b> <b>steward</b> summoned the ship's senior surgeon and a captain's mate, who forced the door. They found Castle dead {{on the floor of a}} self-inflicted gunshot wound. He had placed his wife's photograph inside his shirt over his heart and a picture of his two sons on the shelf in the bathroom opposite the mirror.|$|E

60|$|I {{have taken}} my passage for Liverpool from New York in the Cunarder Russia, on the 22nd of April. I had the second officer's cabin on deck coming out, and I have the chief <b>steward's</b> <b>cabin</b> on deck going home, {{because it will}} be on the sunny side of the ship. I have {{experienced}} nothing here but good humour and cordiality. In the autumn and winter I have arranged with Chappells to take my farewell of reading in the United Kingdom for ever and ever.|$|R
60|$|Came another {{series of}} great rolls. I {{sat down on}} the bed and held on. Miss West, secure in the doorway, began gurgling again, while beyond, across the <b>cabin</b> carpet, the <b>steward</b> shot past, {{embracing}} a small writing- desk that had evidently carried away from its fastenings when he seized hold of it for support. More seas smashed and crashed against the for'ard wall of the cabin; and the steward, failing of lodgment, shot back across the carpet, still holding the desk from harm.|$|R
5000|$|Frou-Frou, a Toy dog {{owned by}} Helen Bishop. The dog {{was allowed to}} stay in her <b>cabin</b> as the <b>stewards</b> {{considered}} it [...] "too pretty" [...] to put among the bigger dogs in the kennels. There were probably more dogs aboard, but their details (and owners) have not survived. Passenger Charles Moore of Washington, D.C. made a last-minute change to his plans to transport aboard Titanic 100 English foxhounds, which he intended to use to start an English-style fox hunt in the Washington area. They were instead shipped aboard another vessel.|$|R
