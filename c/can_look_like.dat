Sometimes the brim is shown much narrower; with a domed top it <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a cappello romano with tassels, but in heraldry it is still called a galero. The tassels may be represented as knotted cords.|$|E
5|$|Mars is {{approximately}} half {{the diameter of}} Earth with a surface area only slightly less than the total area of Earth's dry land. Mars is less dense than Earth, having about 15% of Earth's volume and 11% of Earth's mass, resulting in about 38% of Earth's surface gravity. The red-orange appearance of the Martian surface is caused by iron(III) oxide, or rust. It <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> butterscotch; other common surface colors include golden, brown, tan, and greenish, depending on the minerals present.|$|E
25|$|The Working Kelpie {{comes in}} three coat types: smooth, short, and rough. The coat can be almost every colour from black through light tan or cream. Some Kelpies have a white blaze on the chest, {{and a few}} have white points. Kelpies {{sometimes}} have a double coat, which sheds out in spring in temperate climates. Agouti is not unusual, and <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a double coat.|$|E

25|$|In mathematics, {{particularly}} in complex analysis, a Riemann surface, first studied by and named after Bernhard Riemann, is a one-dimensional complex manifold. Riemann surfaces {{can be thought}} of as deformed versions of the complex plane: locally near every point they look like patches of the complex plane, but the global topology can be quite different. For example, they <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a sphere or a torus or several sheets glued together.|$|E
25|$|Ventricular {{fibrillation}} is a {{cause of}} cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death. The ventricular muscle twitches randomly rather than contracting in a co-ordinated fashion (from {{the apex of the}} heart to the outflow of the ventricles), and so the ventricles fail to pump blood around the body - because of this, it is classified as a cardiac arrest rhythm, and patients in V-fib should be treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation and prompt defibrillation. Left untreated, ventricular fibrillation is rapidly fatal as the vital organs of the body, including the heart, are starved of oxygen, and as a result patients in this rhythm will not be conscious or responsive to stimuli. Prior to cardiac arrest, patients may complain of varying symptoms depending on the underlying cause. Patients may exhibit signs of agonal breathing, which to the layperson <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> normal spontaneous breathing, but it is in fact a sign of hypoperfusion of the brainstem.|$|E
25|$|Herring {{are among}} the most {{spectacular}} schooling fish. They aggregate together in huge numbers. Schools have been measured at over four cubic kilometres in size, containing about four billion fish. These schools move along coastlines and traverse the open oceans. Herring schools in general have very precise arrangements which allow the school to maintain relatively constant cruising speeds. Herrings have excellent hearing, and their schools react very fast to a predator. The herrings keep a certain distance from a moving scuba diver or cruising predator like a killer whale, forming a vacuole which <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a doughnut from a spotter plane. The intricacies of schooling is far from fully understood, especially the swimming and feeding energetics. Many hypotheses to explain the function of schooling have been suggested, such as better orientation, synchronized hunting, predator confusion and reduced risk of being found. Schooling also has disadvantages, such as excretion buildup in the breathing media and oxygen and food depletion. The way the fish array in the school probably gives energy saving advantages, though this is controversial.|$|E

25|$|Subsidence {{occurs when}} {{too much water}} is pumped out from underground, deflating the space below the above-surface, and thus causing the ground to collapse. The result <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> craters on plots of land. This occurs because, in its natural {{equilibrium}} state, the hydraulic pressure of groundwater in the pore spaces of the aquifer and the aquitard supports some {{of the weight of}} the overlying sediments. When groundwater is removed from aquifers by excessive pumping, pore pressures in the aquifer drop and compression of the aquifer may occur. This compression may be partially recoverable if pressures rebound, but much of it is not. When the aquifer gets compressed, it may cause land subsidence, a drop in the ground surface. The city of New Orleans, Louisiana is actually below sea level today, and its subsidence is partly caused by removal of groundwater from the various aquifer/aquitard systems beneath it. In {{the first half of the}} 20th century, the San Joaquin Valley experienced significant subsidence, in some places up to 8.5 metres (28 feet) due to groundwater removal. Cities on river deltas, including Venice in Italy, and Bangkok in Thailand, have experienced surface subsidence; Mexico City, built on a former lake bed, has experienced rates of subsidence of up to 40cm (1'3") per year.|$|E
25|$|These {{days there}} is not much disputing that Ixodes holocyclus is the main vector for Rickettsial Spotted Fever (also known as Queensland tick typhus) (causative {{organism}} the bacteria Rickettsia australis) and Flinders Island Spotted Fever (causative organism Rickettsia honei). Rickettsia australis is an obligate, intracellular bacterial parasite that proliferates within the endothelial cells of small blood vessels, causing a vasculitis. Spotted Fever is probably more common than the Lyme-like Disease. Sometimes infection with Rickettsia australis occurs without a rash - there may just be a high fever. Usually (65% of cases) there is a black spot (known as an eschar, usually 2–5mm in diameter) {{at the site of the}} tick bite. This looks like a scab with redness and swelling around it. Usually there is only one eschar unless there has been more than one tick bite. Often lymph glands nearby are enlarged and painful. Fever starts 1–14 days (usually 7–10 days) following the tick bite, followed within a few days by a rash. The rash <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> chicken pox as the spots may contain some fluid. Other symptoms include headache, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, mental confusion, aching muscles and joints. The illness may be more severe in adults and elderly persons. Spotted Fever is diagnosed by two blood tests (IgM and Weil-Felix tests) taken 10 days apart. PCR analysis of skin biopsies is a more recent testing method. The disease runs its course in two weeks or so but can be cured more quickly with antibiotics (tetracyclines). As antibiotic treatment is very effective, many persons feel so well that they do not return to have the second blood sample collected. But this second blood test is important as it is the only way of proving the diagnosis of Spotted Fever. Spotted Fever rarely, if ever, occurs more than once because the body usually becomes immune for life. In rare instances there may be an apparent repeated infection after recovery - it is not known whether this is caused by another strain. It is also presently unknown if chronic infections occur. It is rarely fatal. Australian Spotted Fever was first described in 1946 when 12 soldiers contracted the disease during training exercises in north Queensland - it was at that time known as Queensland Tick Typhus (QTT). Infections generally arise in rural areas, but 10% of reported cases appear to have been acquired in major cities. It is apparently commonly seen in tick collectors in southern Queensland. It mostly occurs during the winter and spring, but can occur at any time in temperate areas.|$|E
500|$|... "Do Somethin'" [...] is a dance-pop {{song with}} usage of {{electric}} guitars and a [...] "bump beat", {{as described by}} Spence D. of IGN. He also noted the song is [...] "filled with faux string bursts and mock-'70s synth gurgle (think Zapp/Gap Band era) and plenty of treated guitar and bass". According to the sheetmusic published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, it is set at a moderately fast tempo with 130 beats per minute. The song is written in the key of E minor, and Spears' vocal range spans from the low note of E3 to the high note of C6. Lyrically, [...] "Do Somethin'" [...] refers to having fun while being watched by other people, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "Somebody pass my guitar/So I <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a star."

A tornado with a nearly cylindrical profile and relative low height is sometimes referred to as a [...] "stovepipe" [...] tornado. Large single-vortex tornadoes <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> large wedges stuck into the ground, and so are known as [...] "wedge tornadoes" [...] or [...] "wedges". The [...] "stovepipe" [...] classification is also used for this type of tornado if it otherwise fits that profile. A wedge can be so wide that it appears to be a block of dark clouds, wider than the distance from the cloud base to the ground. Even experienced storm observers may not be able to tell the difference between a low-hanging cloud and a wedge tornado from a distance. Many, but not all major tornadoes are wedges.|$|E
500|$|Dürer's woodcut is not {{an entirely}} {{accurate}} representation of a rhinoceros. He depicts an animal with hard plates that cover its body like sheets of armour, with a gorget at the throat, a solid-looking breastplate, and rivets along the seams. He places a small twisted horn on its back, and gives it scaly legs and saw-like rear quarters. None of these features are present in a real rhinoceros, although the Indian rhinoceros does have deep folds in its skin that <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> armor from a distance. Despite its anatomical inaccuracies, Dürer's woodcut became very popular in Europe and was copied {{many times in the}} following three centuries. It was regarded by Westerners as a true representation of a rhinoceros into the late 18th century. Eventually, it was supplanted by more realistic drawings and paintings, particularly those of Clara the rhinoceros, who toured Europe in the 1740s and 1750s. It has been said of Dürer's woodcut: [...] "probably no animal picture has exerted such a profound influence on the arts".|$|E
500|$|Katy Butler {{wrote in}} the San Francisco Bay Guardian that the TVTV style had {{improved}} since their previous work: [...] "This show has fewer interjections from TVTV personnel, fewer moments that drag, more technological razzle-dazzle (color footage, slow motion, stop motion, tight and rapid cutting)." [...] However, she described Guru Maharaj Ji and his entourage as [...] "an easy target" [...] and wrote that [...] "anybody <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a fool when a smartass wide angle lens distorts their face, and teenage ex-dopers who think a fat boy is God don't stand a chance". [...] Butler wished that TVTV would move on to more challenging subjects for their future work. Bob Williams of the New York Post called the documentary a [...] "deplorable film" [...] and [...] "flat, pointless, television". [...] He wrote: [...] "The hour-long program was remiss in not providing some small examination of the available box-office take of the goofy kid guru, much less telling prospective contributors how it got involved in spending how much of its foundation grants and viewer subscription money in such a questionable venture without more inquisitive journalistic endeavor, or ignoring gurus." ...|$|E

50|$|Multi {{sensory touch}} points are {{subconscious}} yet helps use to recognise brands through characteristic identified through human sensors. These characteristics could be shape, colour, textures, sounds, smell or tastes {{associated with a}} given brand. It is important for an advertising campaign to consider sensory cues into their campaign as market places continue to become increasingly competitive and crowded.
