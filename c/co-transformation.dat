40|$|Transgenic loci {{obtained}} after Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation can be simple, but fairly {{often they}} contain multiple T-DNA copies {{integrated into the}} plant genome. To understand the origin of complex T-DNA loci, floral-dip and root transformation experiments were carried out in Arabidopsis thaliana with mixtures of A. tumefaciens strains, each harboring one or two different T-DNA vectors. Upon floral-dip transformation, 6 - 30 % of the transformants were co-transformed by multiple T-DNAs originating from different bacteria and 20 - 36 % by different T-DNAs from one strain. However, these <b>co-transformation</b> frequencies were too low to explain the presence of on average 4 - 6 T-DNA copies in these transformants, suggesting that, upon floral-dip transformation, T-DNA replication frequently occurs before or during integration after the transfer of single T-DNA copies. Upon root transformation, the <b>co-transformation</b> frequencies of T-DNAs originating from different bacteria were similar or slightly higher (between 10 and 60 %) than those obtained after floral-dip transformation, whereas the <b>co-transformation</b> frequencies of different T-DNAs from one strain were comparable (24 - 31 %). Root transformants generally harbor only one to three T-DNA copies, and thus <b>co-transformation</b> of different T-DNAs can explain the T-DNA copy number in many transformants, but T-DNA replication is postulated to occur in most multicopy root transformants. In conclusion, the comparable <b>co-transformation</b> frequencies and differences in complexity of the T-DNA loci after floral-dip and root transformations indicate that the T-DNA copy number is highly determined by the transformation-competent target cells...|$|E

40|$|Seamless cloning methods, such as <b>co-transformation</b> cloning, sequence- and ligation-independent cloning (SLIC) or the Gibson assembly, are {{essential}} tools for the precise construction of plasmids. The efficiency of <b>co-transformation</b> cloning is however {{low and the}} Gibson assembly reagents are expensive. With the aim to improve the robustness of seamless cloning experiments while keeping costs low, we examined the importance of complementary single-stranded DNA ends for <b>co-transformation</b> cloning {{and the influence of}} single-stranded gaps in circular plasmids on SLIC cloning efficiency. Most importantly, our data show that single-stranded gaps in double-stranded plasmids, which occur in typical SLIC protocols, can drastically decrease the efficiency at which the DNA transforms competent E. coli bacteria. Accordingly, filling-in of single-stranded gaps using DNA polymerase resulted in increased transformation efficiency. Ligation of the remaining nicks did not lead to a further increase in transformation efficiency. These findings demonstrate that highly efficient insert-plasmid assembly can be achieved by using only T 5 exonuclease and Phusion DNA polymerase, without Taq DNA ligase from the original Gibson protocol, which significantly reduces the cost of the reactions.

In the present study, we attempted to substitute a single base in situ on the rice OsEPSPS gene by <b>co-transformation</b> of TALEN with chimeric RNA/DNA oligonucleotides (COs), including different strand composition such as RNA/DNA (C 1) or DNA/RNA (C 2) but contained the same target base to be substituted. In contrast to zero GT event obtained by the <b>co-transformation</b> of TALEN with homologous recombination plasmid (HRP), we obtained one mutant showing target base substitution although accompanied by undesired deletion of 12 bases downstream the target site from the <b>co-transformation</b> of TALEN and C 1. In addition to this typical event, we also obtained 16 mutants with different length of base deletions around the target site among 105 calli lines derived from transformation of TALEN alone (4 / 19) as well as <b>co-transformation</b> of TELAN with either HRP (5 / 30) or C 1 (2 / 25) or C 2 (5 / 31).

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Crown gall (CG) (Agrobacterium tumefaciens) and {{the root}} lesion {{nematodes}} (RLNs) (Pratylenchus vulnus) are major {{challenges faced by}} the California walnut industry, reducing productivity and increasing the cost of establishing and maintaining orchards. Current nematode control strategies include nematicides, crop rotation, and tolerant cultivars, but these methods have limits. Developing genetic resistance through novel approaches like RNA interference (RNAi) can address these problems. RNAi-mediated silencing of CG disease in walnut (Juglans regia L.) has been achieved previously. We sought to place both CG and nematode resistance into a single walnut rootstock genotype using <b>co-transformation</b> to stack the resistance genes. A. tumefaciens, carrying self-complimentary iaaM and ipt transgenes, and Agrobacterium rhizogenes, carrying a self-complimentary Pv 010 gene from P. vulnus, were used as <b>co-transformation</b> vectors. RolABC genes were introduced by the resident T-DNA in the A. rhizogenes Ri-plasmid used as a vector for plant transformation. Pv 010 and Pv 194 (transgenic control) genes were also transferred separately using A. tumefaciens. To test for resistance, transformed walnut roots were challenged with P. vulnus and microshoots were challenged with a virulent strain of A. tumefaciens. 				 				 					 						Results 					Combining the two bacterial strains at a 1 : 1 rather than 1 : 3 ratio increased the <b>co-transformation</b> efficiency. Although complete immunity to nematode infection was not observed, transgenic lines yielded up to 79 % fewer nematodes per root following in vitro co-culture than untransformed controls. Transgenic line 33 - 3 - 1 exhibited complete crown gall control and 32 % fewer nematodes. The transgenic plants had thicker, longer roots than untransformed controls possibly due to insertion of rolABC genes. When the Pv 010 gene was present in roots with or without rolABC genes there was partial or complete control of RLNs. Transformation using only one vector showed 100 % control in some lines. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					CG and nematode resistance gene stacking controlled CG and RLNs simultaneously in walnuts. Silencing genes encoding iaaM, ipt, and Pv 010 decrease CG formation and RLNs populations in walnut. Beneficial plant genotype and phenotype changes are caused by <b>co-transformation</b> using A. tumefaciens and A. rhizogenes strains. Viable resistance against root lesion nematodes in walnut plants may be accomplished in the future using this gene stacking technology...|$|E

We have established an automated, fast and flexible low-cost expression cloning approach requiring only vector and insert amplification by PCR and <b>co-transformation</b> of the products. Results Our vectors apply positive selection for the insert or negative selection against empty vector molecules and drive strong expression of target proteins in E. coli cells. Variable tags are available both in N-terminal or C-terminal position. A newly developed β-lactamase (ΔW 290) selection cassette contains a segment inside the β-lactamase open reading frame encoding a stretch of hydrophilic amino acids that result in a T 7 promoter when back-translated. This position of the promoter permits positive selection and attenuated expression of fusion proteins with C-terminal tags.

Seed-specific expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) variants, as well as DsRed, permits the identification of mature transformed seeds in a large background of untransformed seeds by fluorescence microscopy. In planta visualization of transformed seeds in siliques shows that susceptibility to floral dip transformation is limited to a small, defined window in flower development. In the competent stage, the random transformation of up to 25 % of the seeds within a single silique may occur.

Using transient gene expression in rice protoplasts, we provide evidence for the functional interactions of ABI 5 with ABA signaling effectors VP 1 (viviparous 1) and ABI 1 (ABA insensitive 1). <b>Co-transformation</b> experiments with ABI 5 cDNA constructs resulted in specific transactivation of the ABA-inducible wheat Em, Arabidopsis AtEm 6, bean -Phaseolin, and barley HVA 1 and HVA 22 promoters...|$|E
40|$|Plant breeders {{are always}} {{interested}} in new genetic resources. In the past, the sources have been limited to existing germplasm. Genetic engineering now provides the opportunity for almost unlimited strategies to create novel resources. As a first stage, the Applied Biotechnology Center (ABC) at CIMMYT developed a method for the mass production of fertile transgenic wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) that yields plants ready for transfer to soil in 13 – 14 weeks after the initiation of cultures, and, {{over the course of}} a year, an average production of 5 – 6 transgenic plants per day. CIMMYT elite cultivars are co-bombarded with marker gene and a gene of interest with <b>co-transformation</b> efficiencies around 25 – 30...|$|E
40|$|We have {{extended}} {{the technique of}} PCR-directed recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to develop a simple method for plasmid or gene construction {{in the absence of}} suitable restriction sites. The DNA to be cloned is PCR-amplified with 30 – 40 bp of homology to a linearized yeast plasmid. <b>Co-transformation</b> into yeast results in homologous recombination at a position directed by the PCR oligonucleotides. The observation that linear DNA fragments can efficiently stimulate recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1) has led to the rapid development of powerful methods for DNA manipulation in yeast (2). Widely used recombination-based DNA manipulation methods include integrative DNA transforma-tion, which is used to produce a chromosomal null allele of a gen...|$|E
