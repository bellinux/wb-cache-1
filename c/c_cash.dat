40|$|This study {{examines}} hedging strategies for commodity processors generally and soybean crushers specifically. Processors require hedging strategies built around processing multiple batches each year. Each batch requires {{the purchase of}} inputs, transformation of inputs into outputs, and sale of the resulting output. The more batches processed, the greater the transaction frequency, the smaller each batch's size. Increased transaction frequency reduces risk because of the smaller batch size. This study distinguishes between batch (accounting) profits and periodic profits (cash flows). Traditional hedging models have focused on batch profits but we argue that hedging cash flows are also a legitimate hedging target because (a) discounted cash flow is the capital investment decision criterion, (b) costs are associated with managing working capital, (<b>c)</b> <b>cash</b> flow and profits converge in annual aggregation, and (d) stabilizing periodic cash flow stabilizes annual profits but the converse does not hold. Weekly cash and futures prices from 1990 through 2003 are used to compare averages {{and standard deviations of}} direct-hedged and unhedged profits and cash flows with transaction frequencies of 1, 2, 4, 13, 26 and 52 weeks. Our findings are as follows. (1) Increased transaction frequency reduces the variance of unhedged profits and cash flows. Two effects account for this. Both profit and cash flow risks are reduced by smaller batch size associated with increased transaction frequency but only profit risk is reduced by closer integration of input and output markets as transaction frequency increases. (2) As transaction frequency increases, the amount of hedgeable risk declines (finding 1) and the effectiveness of traditional hedges also declines. (3) Anticipatory hedging of soybean processing does not offer much risk protection. (4) Traditional hedging of batch profits tends to destabilize periodic cash flows.

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{support for a}} proposal to eliminate refund fraud in the U. S. by turning Forms W- 2, and 1099 into self-certified/ self-authenticated tax documents. The proposal suggests that a “digital signature” of these documents should be taken after they are completed. The signature should then be made part of the final document. This proposal was initially advanced in Refund Fraud? Real-Time Solution! The underlying premise of that article was that the US could dramatically reduce, if not eliminate, refund fraud if it borrowing digital security techniques from the VAT. The article did not however, explain or expand upon these techniques from within the VATs where they were developed. This article takes up the VAT side of that analysis. VAT frauds frequently manipulate documents for gain, and VAT jurisdictions have spent {{a considerable amount of}} time and energy devising effective and efficient methods for determining if a document is legitimate (or original). The strong suggestion is that the IRS should look to the VAT to solve refund fraud, because even though the tax is different, the administrative problem is the same. The refund fraud problem is essentially document verification problem. The VAT is very good at document verification. The IRS can learn from the VAT. This paper looks at three VAT jurisdictions, Brazil, Quebec and Belgium, and explains how they use technology to solve document authentication problems. In each case a tax fraud is facilitated by false documentation, and the administrative response is to use technology to certify the documents and stop the fraud. In Brazil the fraud arises in the context of internal cross-border B 2 B transactions. In Quebec and Belgium the fraud is skimming profits from B 2 <b>C</b> <b>cash</b> and debit/credit card transactions...|$|E
40|$|Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is {{the most}} common fatal {{inherited}} disease in Caucasians. Mean survival for this condition has increased significantly in recent decades such that extra- pulmonary complications of CF have become more apparent (1). The most important complication is abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT) as it is known to {{have a negative impact on}} important CF outcomes such as lung function and nutrition (2). Despite this, AGT in CF remains poorly understood. The overall aim of this thesis was to increase understanding of how AGT affects children and adolescents with CF. This thesis is comprised of 3 studies. The first is a cross sectional study that examined the impact of AGT on a group of children and adolescents attending the CF unit at the Royal Children’s Hospital in Melbourne. This study identified that AGT has a significantly negative impact on children and adolescents with CF including significantly worse lung function, increased admissions and infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This effect was most pronounced in patients with Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes (CFRD) but was also present to a lesser extent in those with Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT). The second study examined the impact of AGT on structural lung disease in CF. In a retrospective review, spirometry and CT findings were compared in patients with Normal Glucose Tolerance (NGT), IGT and CFRD. Despite stable lung function over 2 years in all 3 groups, CT scores progressed in proportion to worsening glucose tolerance status. Finally, the impact of CF pulmonary exacerbations on glucose tolerance was studied prospectively. An oral glucose tolerance test and continuous glucose monitoring were performed during exacerbations and repeated at follow up. Contrary to a previous study, it was found that glucose tolerance status did not change significantly during exacerbations. These findings of the first two studies confirm the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of AGT in CF. Structural lung disease progressed more rapidly in patients with AGT despite stable lung function. Glucose tolerance is therefore important as it is strongly associated with progression of lung structural damage. Conventional lung function is not a surrogate for either assessing glucose status or lung structure. Finally, hyperglycaemia found during CF pulmonary exacerbations is unlikely to resolve and consideration should be given to starting those patients on insulin. Abstract references 1.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to apply the <b>cash</b> to <b>cash</b> (<b>C</b> 2 C) cycle to companies involved in the shipping & transport aspect of international supply chains. Methodology: Primary data was collected from publically available corporate annual reports for 41 companies operating in four categories of the shipping & transport industry (third party logistics providers (3 PLs), liners, bunker suppliers, and bulk & transport companies) across eleven years (2000 - 2011). The C 2 C values were tested through ordinary least square single variable linear regression to establish relationships between C 2 C and two other financial metrics: return on assets (ROA) and year over year sales growth. In addition, graphical analysis was conducted in order to observe historical trends within the eleven year history. Findings: Statistical analysis conducted in open source programming language R indicated low Multiple R Squared values indicating little predictive ability of C 2 C cycle to either ROA or year over year sales growth. The C 2 C cycle should, thus, be seen as an additional, not replacement tool for performance measurement purposes. Graphical analysis indicated a general trend of stabilization of the C 2 C values across the four categories, although a recent divergence has occurred as the average C 2 C values increased in the bunker industry, stabilized for 3 PLs and liners, and decreased for bulk & tanker companies. Value: This research was a first attempt to apply the C 2 C cycle to companies operating in the shipping & transport industry. Future Research: Future research should focus upon increased application of the C 2 C cycle to service based industries, especially the shipping & transport industry. In addition, the relationship between the C 2 C cycle of various companies and their macroeconomic operation environment may be further examined.
