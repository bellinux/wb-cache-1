25|$|The rumen of {{the water}} buffalo has {{important}} differences from that of other ruminants. It contains a larger population of bacteria, particularly the <b>cellulolytic</b> bacteria, lower protozoa, and higher fungi zoospores. In addition, higher rumen ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) and higher pH have been found as compared to those in cattle.|$|E
25|$|The entire gut flora of a termite {{very closely}} related to N. corniger has been {{analysed}} using metagenomics to determine the function of different microbes in their gut. Typical to all wood-feeding higher termites, bacterial gut microbiota in the guts of N. corniger are dominated by insect-specific members of TG3_(candidate_phylum), Fibrobacteres, and Spirochaetes. It {{has also been shown}} that the same bacterial lineages are preferentially enriched in the <b>cellulolytic</b> bacterial community that is associated with wood particles in the gut.|$|E
5000|$|Cytophaga hutchinsonii --- aerobic <b>cellulolytic</b> soil {{bacterium}} that {{is known}} for its ability to rapidly glide over surfaces. The mechanism of cellulose digestion is not fully known; however, it is known that C. hutchinsonii has multiple cell-associated <b>cellulolytic</b> enzymes.|$|E

50|$|Streptomyces abietis is a <b>cellulolytic</b> {{bacterium}} {{species from}} the genus of Streptomyces which was isolated from topsoil of a pine forest from the Hokkaido prefecture in Japan.|$|E
50|$|Clostridium straminisolvens is a {{moderately}} thermophilic, aerotolerant and <b>cellulolytic</b> bacterium. It is non-motile, spore-forming, straight or slightly curved rod, with type strain CSK1T (=DSM 16021T =IAM 15070T). Its genome has been sequenced.|$|E
50|$|Clostridium stercorarium is a <b>cellulolytic</b> {{thermophilic}} bacteria. It is anaerobic, spore-forming and saccharoclastic, with cells being rod-shaped and 0.7 to 0.8 by 2.7 to 7.7 µm in size. Its genome {{has been}} sequenced.|$|E
50|$|Clostridium cellulovorans is an anaerobic, mesophilic, spore-forming <b>cellulolytic</b> bacterium. Its {{cells are}} gram-negative and are non-motile rods which form oblong spores. The type strain is 743B (ATCC 35296). Its {{role as an}} object of study is based on the latter notion.|$|E
50|$|Arnold's Caltech {{research}} is in green chemistry and alternative energy, including {{the development of}} highly active enzymes (<b>cellulolytic</b> and biosynthetic enzymes) and microorganisms to convert renewable biomass to fuels and chemicals. She is co-inventor on numerous patents and co-founded Gevo, Inc. in 2005.|$|E
50|$|Caldicellulosiruptor bescii is {{a species}} of thermophilic, {{anaerobic}} <b>cellulolytic</b> bacteria. It was isolated from a geothermally heated freshwater pool in the Valley of Geysers on the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia in 1990. The species was originally named Anaerocellum thermophilum, but reclassified in 2010, based on genomic data.|$|E
50|$|Fibrolytic Bacteria {{constitute}} {{a group of}} microorganisms {{that are able to}} process complex plant polysaccharides thanks to their capacity to synthesize <b>cellulolytic</b> and hemicellulolytic enzymes. Polysaccharides are present in plant cellular cell walls in a compact fiber form where they are mainly composed of cellulose and hemicellulose.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>cellulolytic</b> {{bacteria}} use cellodextrins {{as their}} primary source of energy. The energy is obtained through the phosphorolytic cleavage of glycosidic bonds {{as well as the}} anaerobic glycolysis of the glucose monomers. Transport of cellodextrins across the cell membrane is usually an active process, requiring ATP.|$|E
50|$|While {{investigating}} {{the role of}} <b>cellulolytic</b> protozoa in the rumen of cattle, Hungate isolated a colony of Clostridium cellobioparum, but the difficulty in observing the cellulose clearings they produced in shake tubes spurred him to develop a culturing method using thin agar layers in roll tubes.|$|E
50|$|Trichoderma reesei is a {{mesophilic}} and filamentous fungus. It is an anamorph of {{the fungus}} Hypocrea jecorina.T. reesei {{has the capacity}} to secrete large amounts of <b>cellulolytic</b> enzymes (cellulases and hemicellulases). Microbial cellulases have industrial application in the conversion of cellulose, a major component of plant biomass, into glucose.|$|E
50|$|The rumen of {{the water}} buffalo has {{important}} differences from that of other ruminants. It contains a larger population of bacteria, particularly the <b>cellulolytic</b> bacteria, lower protozoa, and higher fungi zoospores. In addition, higher rumen ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) and higher pH have been found as compared to those in cattle.|$|E
50|$|The scaffoldin {{component}} of the <b>cellulolytic</b> bacterium Clostridium thermocellum is a non-hydrolytic protein which organises the hydrolytic enzymes into a large complex, called the cellulosome. Scaffoldin comprises a series of functional domains, amongst which is a single cellulose-binding domain and nine cohesin domains which are responsible for integrating the individual enzymatic subunits into the complex.|$|E
50|$|Many Pseudogymnoascus {{species are}} <b>cellulolytic,</b> {{function}} as saprotrophs and are either psychrophilic or psychrotolerant. Pseudogymnoascus roseus {{was able to}} form an ericoid mycorrhizal association in vitro and Pseudogymnoascus destructans infects hibernating bat and survives in the cave environment as a saprotroph. Interestingly, Müller indicated that all known Pseudogymnoascus species, prior to 1982, were not known to be keratinolytic.|$|E
50|$|Cellodextrins {{are created}} through the {{cleavage}} of cellulose in most anaerobic bacteria by the cellulosome (an amalgamation of <b>cellulolytic</b> enzymes {{on the outside}} of a cell). An endoglucanase first cuts the crystalline cellulose in an amorphous zone and exoglucanases subsequently cleave these large insoluble chunks of cellulose into smaller, soluble cellodextrins which can be used by the cell.|$|E
50|$|Fibrobacter succinogenes is a <b>cellulolytic</b> {{bacterium}} {{species in}} the genus Fibrobacter. It {{is present in the}} rumen of cattle. Beta glucans are its substrate of choice in the rumen and its products after digestion include formate, acetate and succinate. Fibrobacter succinogenes forms characteristic extensive grooves in crystalline cellulose, and is also rather readily detached from its substrate during sample preparation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{microbial}} degradation of cellulose and xylans requires {{several types of}} enzymes such as endoglucanases (...) , cellobiohydrolases (...) (exoglucanases), or xylanases (...) [...] Fungi and bacteria produces a spectrum of <b>cellulolytic</b> enzymes (cellulases) and xylanases which, {{on the basis of}} sequence similarities, can be classified into families. One of these families is known as the cellulase family F or as the glycosyl hydrolases family 10.|$|E
50|$|Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus is {{a species}} of thermophilic, {{anaerobic}} <b>cellulolytic</b> bacteria. It was isolated from {{a piece of wood}} floating in the flow from a freshwater thermal spring in New Zealand in 1987, and tentatively named Caldocellum saccharolyticum. In 1994, the isolate was more thoroughly characterized physiologically, and classified to a new genus, Caldicellusiruptor, based on 16S RNA sequence. It is the type species, and more thoroughly studied member of its genus.|$|E
50|$|Researching {{the black}} slug has {{provided}} human and ecological value. For example, a 1996 {{study investigated the}} bioaccumulation of mercury in black slugs and determined these slugs {{could be used to}} monitor levels of heavy metals in terrestrial systems—similar to how ecologists use aquatic mollusks. And a 2014 study researched the black slug gut’s microbiology in hopes of catalyzing other studies of <b>cellulolytic</b> activity that could improve biofuel technology.|$|E
50|$|Atmospheric moisture, gastric acid, light, and enzymes hydrolyze {{cellulose}} acetate to acetic acid and cellulose. Cellulose may be further hydrolyzed to cellobiose or glucose in an acidic medium, and eventually form valuable humus. Humans cannot digest cellulose and excrete the fibers in feces, because, unlike ruminant animals, termites, and some bacteria and fungi, they lack <b>cellulolytic</b> enzymes such as cellulase. Like wood, paper and cotton, cigarette filters in soil rot slowly over months to years.|$|E
50|$|Termites eat one another's feces as a {{means of}} obtaining their hindgut protists. Termites and protists have a {{symbiotic}} relationship (e.g. with the protozoan that allows the termites to digest the cellulose in their diet). For example, in one group of termites, there is a three-way symbiotic relationship: termites of the family Rhinotermitidae, <b>cellulolytic</b> protists of the genus Pseudotrichonympha in the guts of these termites, and intracellular bacterial symbionts of the protists.|$|E
50|$|Fibrolitic {{bacteria}} {{are expected to}} play an important role in renewable energy production through biomass degradation.One of the main objectives of biotechology is biofuel production with the aim to reduce CO2 emissions, because biofuels obtained from plant material does not contribute a net atmospheric input of CO2. The gas emitted during the combustion of biofuels of <b>cellulolytic</b> origin will be reabsorbed in vegetable growth and this is why it does not have an environmental impact so negative.|$|E
50|$|The {{microbial}} degradation of cellulose and xylans requires {{several types of}} enzymes. Fungi and bacteria produces a spectrum of <b>cellulolytic</b> enzymes (cellulases) and xylanases which, {{on the basis of}} sequence similarities, can be classified into families. One of these families is known as the cellulase family A or as the glycosyl hydrolases family 5. One of the conserved regions in this family contains a conserved glutamic acid residue which is potentially involved in the catalytic mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Chaetomium atrobrunneum is {{strongly}} <b>cellulolytic,</b> and cellulose-containing growth media {{can be used}} to selectively cultivate this and other Chaetomium species. This species has also been reported to produce chaetoatrosin A, a selective inhibitor of chitin synthase II. This enzyme is involved in septum formation and cellular division, and its inhibition by chaetoatrosin A is thought to be the mechanism underlying the antifungal effects of C. atrobrunneum culture filtrates against several medically important fungi including Cryptococcus neoformans.|$|E
50|$|Limnoria lignorum ingest wood {{fragments}} as they burrow. They do {{not seem}} to house bacteria in their gut that are able to digest lignin, {{as is the case in}} some other wood-boring species, and seem to rely on their <b>cellulolytic</b> enzymes to digest cellulose. They may also feed on fungal hyphae directly or may consume them indirectly in wood that is already softened as a result of attack by fungi and bacteria. The enzymes it produces to break up wood into sugars which it can digest are being investigated for producing biofuel.|$|E
50|$|Stigmatella species hence {{appear in}} nature to help {{decompose}} otherwise insoluble biological debris. It is only distantly {{related to the}} <b>cellulolytic</b> myxobacteria, does not produce cellulases, and is strongly bacteriolytic. Therefore, Stigmatella consumes organisms that feed on wood rather that feeding on wood directly. Besides bacteria, its production of antifungal antibiotics suggests that Stigmatella species may feed on yeasts and fungi as well, or alternatively, may suggest that Stigmatella competes with fungi for shared resources. By producing antimicrobial compounds, Stigmatella {{may play a role}} in maintaining the balance of the microbial population in its habitat.|$|E
50|$|Molecular {{evidence}} {{based on}} the amplification of 16rRNA genes from various environments suggest that the phylum is much more widespread than previously thought. Most of the clones from mammalian environments group along with the known isolates {{in what has been}} called Fibrobacteres subphylum 1. Members of Fibrobacteres subphylum 2 however, have so far been found only in the gut of termites. and in some litter-feeding cockroaches. The predominance of Fibrobacteres subphylum 2 in <b>cellulolytic</b> fibre-associated bacterial communities in hindguts of wood-feeding Nasutitermes corniger suggests that they {{play an important role in}} the breakdown of plant material in higher termites.|$|E
5000|$|Strains of G. pannorum are halotolerant, {{moderately}} <b>cellulolytic,</b> {{and able}} to survive and grow {{in the presence of}} multiple environmental stressors. This species is generally regarded to be keratinophilic (exhibiting a proclivity to grow on shed keratin) and accordingly produces keratinases. [...] Sodium chloride is stimulatory to its growth on Czapek's medium (a growth medium in which sodium nitrate is the sole source of nitrogen and sucrose is source of carbon). Growth has been observed in low oxygen environments. Geomyces pannorum is resistant to the antifungal agent cycloheximide. However the growth of this species is inhibited by ultraviolet(UV)-B light.|$|E
5000|$|Edward A. Bayer {{participated in}} the {{development}} of avidin-biotin technology [...] (together with Meir Wilchek) that contributed to the field of biorecognition and is intensively used in various biochemical applications, e.g. for affinity chromatography, affinity labeling, affinity therapy and many more.During his post-doctoral studies at Tel Aviv University, Edward A. Bayer co-discoverered the Cellulosome [...] (together with Raphael Lamed Professor at Tel Aviv University), an intricate multi-enzyme complex produced by many <b>cellulolytic</b> anaerobic microorganisms. In 1994, Edward A. Bayer proposed an original concept for the construction of designer cellulosomes, based on the specific affinity between cohesin and dockerin modules from the same bacterial species and type.|$|E
