The {{building}} is virtually there, timings are the issue. But that’s not just true for the velodrome, it’s the same for other venues. They’ve had well-publicised problems, but I want to be supportive and the UCI will help as much as we can." [...] President of the International Cycling Union Brian Cookson In April 2015, construction was temporarily suspended by Brazil's Ministry of Labor and Employment, claiming a [...] "grave and imminent danger to the physical safety of workers." [...] The ministry cited their concerns for [...] "the absence of collective protection", and risk of workers falling, in addition to lack of security, no technical report on the stability of slopes at the site, and what was described as a potentially hazardous [...] "accumulation of material". The temporary suspension added even more stress on the construction's timetable, with works being sped up significantly afterwards, with the Organising Committee stressing that [...] "work was back on track." [...] Unfortunately, delays proved to be a valid concern, when <b>cycling</b> <b>test</b> events originally scheduled to take place at the Velodrome on 18 - 20 March 2016 were rescheduled to 29 April - 1 May, due to a delay in the installation of the velodrome's track. Blame was put on poor conditions for the installation of the Siberian-sourced timber, which could potentially lead to the wood warping and bending. It was by then that President of the UCI Brian Cookson made public his concerns about the completion of the venue, bluntly stating to the media, in a press conference after the 2016 UCI Track Cycling World Championships, that completing the venue in time for test events in late April was [...] "a challenge", and that [...] "if the velodrome is not ready in time, there is no plan B." ...|$|E
40|$|Phase Change Material (PCM) is {{the most}} {{promising}} material as thermal energy storage nowadays. As thermal energy storage, examination on endurance of material for long-term use is necessary to be carried out. Therefore, thermal <b>cycling</b> <b>test</b> is performed to ensure thermal stability of PCM. This study have found a new method on thermal <b>cycling</b> <b>test</b> of PCM sample by using thermoelectric as heating and cooling element. RT 22 HC was used as PCM sample on this thermal <b>cycling</b> <b>test.</b> The new method had many advantages compared to some references of the same test. It just needed a small container for PCM sample. The thermoelectric could release heat to PCM sample and absorb heat from PCM sample uniformly, respectively, was called as heating and cooling process. Hence, thermoelectric had to be supported by a relay control device to change its polarity so it could heat and cool PCM sample alternately and automatically. On the other hand, the thermoelectric was cheap, easy to be found and available in markets. It can be concluded that new method of thermal <b>cycling</b> <b>test</b> by using thermoelectric as source of heating and cooling can be a new reference for performing thermal <b>cycling</b> <b>test</b> on PCM...|$|E

The quasi-static tensile tests of jute fiber, PLA, and composite were conducted after thermal <b>cycling</b> <b>tests.</b> Thermal mechanical analyses of jute fiber and PLA were conducted after thermal <b>cycling</b> <b>tests.</b> Results led to the following conclusions.

For temperatures of 35 – 55 °C, tensile strength and Young’s modulus of composite at 103 cycles decreased 15 % and 10 %, respectively, compared to that of composite at 0 cycles. Tensile properties and the coefficient of linear expansion of PLA and jute fiber remained almost unchanged after thermal <b>cycling</b> <b>tests.</b> From observation of a fracture surface, the length of fiber pull out in the fracture surface of composite at 103 cycles was longer than that of composite at 0 cycles. Therefore, tensile properties of the composite during thermal cycling were decreased, probably because of the decrease of interfacial adhesion between the fiber and resin...|$|R

30|$|Sweat on {{the skin}} surface after the <b>cycling</b> <b>tests</b> could have {{influenced}} the IRT data and {{it should also be}} considered a limitation of the present study.

For this reason, it was decided not to remove the sweat on the skin for the thermographic measurements after the <b>cycling</b> <b>tests</b> in order to avoid an increase of skin temperature due to rubbing, and also the reduction of the natural process of sweat evaporation (Priego Quesada et al. 2015 b).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{effect of}} thermal cycling after water {{absorption}} on flexural property of CFRP(Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics) was examined. Water absorption {{tests were conducted}} for 24 hours, 100 hours and 500 hours at 90 °C. Thermal <b>cycling</b> <b>test</b> was conducted by using water absorbed specimen. The temperature range of thermal <b>cycling</b> <b>test</b> was from room temperature to- 196 °C. The static three-point flexural test of CFRP with freezing after water absorption was conducted based on JIS(Japanese Industrial standard) K 7074. Following conclusions are obtained. In case of immersion for 24 hours, flexural strength and modulus of CFRP with freezing after water absorption decreased with an increase {{of the number of}} cycles. In case of immersion for 100 hours and 500 hours, flexural strength and modulus of CFRP with freezing after water absorption did not change. The water absorption of CFRP was the phenomenon that the water penetrated into fiber/resin interface. So, in the case of immersion for 24 hours that the absorption time is not so long, damage progresses gradually in thermal <b>cycling</b> <b>test.</b> On the other hand, in the case of immersion for 500 hours is long, the damage progresses at the early stage of the thermal <b>cycling</b> <b>test,</b> and after that the damage does not almost progress...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The 6 -minute walk test (6 MWT) is {{frequently}} {{used as an}} outcome measure for clinical trials in neuromuscular disease. Because this submaximal endurance test is not feasible for nonambulatory patients, the motor-assisted 6 -minute <b>cycling</b> <b>test</b> (A 6 MCT) was developed. METHODS: Nineteen children with neuromuscular disorders and children with OXPHOS-dysfunction performed the a 6 MCT and the 6 MWT to explore feasibility and construct validity. Test-retest reproducibility was evaluated within 3 weeks. RESULTS: The assisted 6 -minute <b>cycling</b> <b>test</b> was feasible in 90 % and 78 % of the patients with a neuromuscular disorder and OXPHOS-dysfunction, respectively. The A 6 MCT for legs correlated with the 6 MWT in both patient groups. The assisted 6 -minute cycling showed good reproducibility for both legs and arms.

40|$|Nowadays, {{numerous}} {{power electronics}} application requires operation at high temperatures. In {{order to address}} increasing change of reliability problems in power die attachments for high temperature and high reliability applications, sintering Ag nanoparticles {{has been used as}} bonding material for this work. Firstly, quantitative microstructure characterization of as-sintered Ag joints has been carried out. The resulting normalized thickness, pore size and porosity decreased, and grain size increased with increasing the sintering time. A time dependence of the form t 1 /n with n close to 2 or 3 can be further derived for the kinetics of the thinning, densification and grain growth within the sintered Ag joints. From the results can be seen, sintering kinetics is still in the intermediate stage, the densification had not been completed, and Ag grain would continue growing afterwards, which could further explain degradation behaviours of sintered joints during isothermal ageing <b>tests</b> and thermal <b>cycling</b> <b>tests.</b> Secondly, sintered Ag joints with four kinds of substrate metallization have been subjected to isothermal ageing tests at temperatures of 150 °C, 200 °C and 250 °C for up to 32 days. The different microstructure patterns of sintered joints with four substrate finishes during isothermal ageing tests have been presented and compared, which could use the results to explain part of the degradation behaviours of the sintered Ag joints during thermal <b>cycling</b> <b>tests</b> and guide selection of suitable substrate finish for the die attachments in high temperature power electronic system.
