50|$|The {{artificial}} {{structure for}} cloaking applications is a lattice design - a sequentially repeating network - of identical elements. Additionally, for microwave frequencies, these materials are analogous to <b>crystals</b> for <b>optics.</b> Also, a metamaterial {{is composed of}} a sequence of elements and spacings, which are {{much smaller than the}} selected wavelength of light. The selected wavelength could be radio frequency, microwave, or other radiations, now just beginning to reach into the visible frequencies. Macroscopic properties can be directly controlled by adjusting characteristics of the rudimentary elements, and their arrangement on, or throughout the material. Moreover, these metamaterials are a basis for building very small cloaking devices in anticipation of larger devices, adaptable to a broad spectrum of radiated light.|$|R
5000|$|In his 1957 paper, Pekar {{advanced}} {{a theory}} of electromagnetic waves near exciton resonances currently known as polaritons. He predicted existence of new (additional, or Pekar) light waves due to a small effective mass of electronic excitons. Small mass translates into a large curvature of the polariton spectrum and additional roots for the momentum at a given wave frequency. Inclusion of the additional waves into the classical <b>crystal</b> <b>optics</b> requires additional boundary conditions onto the mechanical and electromagnetic components of polaritons. These waves were observed experimentally and certified as a discovery. [...] An important prediction of Pekar’ theory is violation of the Kramers-Kronig relation in polariton resonances because the real part of dielectric function {{is controlled by the}} oscillator strength of polariton transition (or the splitting between the upper and lower polariton branches) while the imaginary part of it by the decay of polaritons. This prediction of the theory is supported by the low-temperature spectrum of the first exciton-polariton band of naphthalene crystals. A phenomenological theory of additional waves has been developed in the framework of the <b>crystal</b> <b>optics</b> with spatial dispersion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crystal</b> <b>optics</b> is {{the branch}} of optics that {{describes}} the behaviour of light in anisotropic media, that is, media (such as crystals) in which light behaves differently depending on which direction the light is propagating.

Crystals are often naturally anisotropic, and in some media (such as liquid crystals) {{it is possible to}} induce anisotropy by applying an external electric field.|$|E

40|$|The OMEGA {{laser system}} uses over 300 liquid <b>crystal</b> (LC) <b>optics</b> {{to control the}} {{polarization}} of light.
