500|$|Sean Kinney {{said about}} the band's reunion: [...] "I never called Jerry; he never <b>called</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> ’Hey, let’s get the band back together,’ you know? We had been taking every step {{extremely}} cautious and slow, and just doing whatever feels right: If it’s genuine and we’re doing it for genuine reasons and we’re all okay with it then we take a little step. None of us is broke. Nobody {{needs to be a}} rock dork, and you know, stroke their ego. I mean, we don’t really operate like that. So as long as it felt good and from the right place and it’s about making music and carrying on…".|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} to New York, the New York Dolls played to capacity crowds at venues such as Max's Kansas City and the Mercer Arts Center in what Sylvain called a determined effort to [...] "fake it {{until they could}} make it": [...] "We had to make ourselves feel famous before we could actually become famous. We acted like we were already rock stars. Arthur even called his bass 'Excalibur' after King Arthur. It was crazy." [...] Their performance at the Mercer Arts Center was attended by journalist and Mercury Records publicity director Bud Scoppa, and Paul Nelson, an A executive for the label. Scoppa initially viewed them as an amusing but inferior version of the Rolling Stones: [...] "I split after the first set. Paul stuck around for the second set, though, and after show he <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'You should have stayed. I think they're really special.' Then, after that, I {{fell in love with}} them anyway." [...] In March 1973, the group signed a two-album deal with a US $25,000 advance from Mercury. According to Sylvain, some of the members' parents had to sign for them because they were not old enough to sign themselves.|$|E
2500|$|Littlejohn's ex-girlfriend, Sandra Smith, testified on Thursday, May 14, {{the fourth}} day of the trial. She said that, after St. Guillen's death, {{he asked her to}} lie about his using her Chrysler Sebring to see his ailing mother in a Queens nursing home. [...] "He <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> if anyone calls, [...] say he had my car;" [...] however, she {{informed}} police that he did not use the vehicle. Police suspect that Littlejohn used another van to abduct and sexually molest St. Guillen.|$|E

2500|$|In 1944 Journalists David Nasser and Jean Manzon made an unfriendly {{report of}} the Medium, which was {{published}} at [...] "O Cruzeiro" [...] Magazine. The Reporters pretended to be foreigners using false names {{in order to test}} whether Chico was a fraud; Later when Nasser and Manzon arrived home after the interview, they were surprised, as reported by Nasser in an interview with TV Cultura in 1980: [...] "From dawn, the Manzon <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'have you seen the book that Chico Xavier gave to us?'. I said no. 'So you see,' he said. I was in my library, I picked up the book and was written : 'To my brother David Nasser, Emmanuel'. He had made a similar dedication for Manzon.

2500|$|In an interview, Tancredo {{said his}} falling {{out with the}} White House has lasted. [...] "One reason I am persona non grata at the White House is {{not just because of}} immigration... but because I refuse to support him on his trade policy, his {{education}} policy, Medicare and prescription drugs initiatives.... Here was a Republican Congress increasing government to an extent larger than it had been increased since Medicare had come into existence." [...] Tancredo reported that his career in Congress was threatened by the leadership because of his stances. [...] "I was called into Tom DeLay's office because I was supporting Republican challengers to Republican incumbents. I had a group called Team America that went out and did that. He <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> to me, 'You’re jeopardizing your career in this place by doing these things.' And I said, 'Tom, out of all the things you can threaten with me that is the least effective because I do not look at this place as a career.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Strangers are energy {{beings who}} reside in dead human bodies. When design first started, the filmmakers {{considered}} having the Strangers be bugs underneath but {{decided that the}} bug appearance was overused. Tatopoulos said Proyas {{wanted to make the}} Strangers energy beings, [...] "Alex <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> he wanted something like an energy that kept re-powering itself, re-creating itself, re-shaping itself, sitting inside a dry piece of human shape." [...] The Strangers reside in a large underground amphitheater for their lair, where a human bust hides a large clock and a spiraling device changes the layout of the city above. The set for the lair was fifty feet (15 m) in height, where an average set is thirty-six feet (11 m). The lair set was built on a fairground in Sydney, Australia. The film's budget was $30–40 million, so the crew used inexpensive techniques to design the set, such as stretching canvas onto welded metal frames. The lair also had a rail conveyance that appeared expensive. Tatopoulos said, [...] "We had, obviously, a car built, but we had just one built. [...] We laid some rail for it to ride on. We made a section of corridor that we kept driving through all the time, and you end up believing this thing is running along forever." [...] Proyas originally wanted the rail car to roll by various rooms, which was not feasible for the budget, so Tatopoulos and the crew used [...] "replaceable elements and strong design textures" [...] to mimic the impression of various rooms.|$|E

It was just a thrill." [...] (Steve Lukather, Guitar Player magazine, April 1984) ...|$|R
5000|$|The director, Kripalani {{said that}} he was frightened before showing the film to the censor board, but they loved it and didn’t suggest any cuts in the film. In a statement, he said, “I was really worried about how the censors will react because it is thematically an adult film. When they saw the movie, they <b>called</b> <b>me</b> in <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that they can’t cut one single thing from the movie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't. You {{asked if}} you could <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Mary, <b>and</b> I <b>said</b> you might, because I loved you too much to deny your {{smallest}} whim. I was going {{on to say that}} it wasn't my name, but you interrupted me." ...|$|R

So I put on an old shawl and went with him. The ship was pitching and heaving with a dreadful straining and creaking noise. A dim light burned in the cabin, and outside there was a great roaring of the wind and the wild sound of the sea surging against the ship.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] said Matlack, relighting his pipe, [...] "he {{knows me}} better than that. If he'd <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Phil, I {{want you to}} take charge of a couple that's goin' honey-moonin' about twenty-five years after they married, and a-doin' it for {{somebody}} else and not for themselves,' I'd said to him, 'They're lunatics, and I won't take charge of them.' And Peter he knows I would have thought that and would have said it, and so he did not mention the particulars to me. He knows that the only things that I'm afraid of in this world is lunatics. 'Tisn't only what they might do to me, but what they might do to themselves, and I won't touch 'em." ...|$|E

6000|$|Shall I tell you, my dear, {{that when}} Francois woke me {{at a very}} early hour on this eventful morning, while the keen stars were still {{glittering}} overhead, a half-moon, as sharp as a razor, beaming in the frosty sky, and a wicked north wind blowing, that blew the blood out of one's fingers and froze your leg as you put it out of bed;--shall I tell you, my dear, that when Francois <b>called</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "V'la vot' cafe, Monsieur Titemasse, buvez-le, tiens, il est tout chaud," [...] I felt myself, after imbibing the hot breakfast, so comfortable under three blankets and a mackintosh, that for at least {{a quarter of an hour}} no man in Europe could say whether Titmarsh would or would not be present at the burial of the Emperor Napoleon.|$|E

I did not leave my children. My children are with their father, where they are supposed to be. I didn't do it to be a mother...
