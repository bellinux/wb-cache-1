50|$|Since then, the {{use in the}} Silk Road's media reporting, {{many people}} and media outlets, have taken to using Deep Web synonymously with the dark web or darknet, a {{comparison}} many reject as inaccurate and consequently is an ongoing source of confusion. Wired reporters Kim Zetter and Andy Greenberg recommend the terms be used in distinct fashions.

The most famous content that resides on the dark Web is found in the TOR network, i.e., an anonymous network that <b>can</b> only <b>be</b> accessed with a special Web browser, called the TOR browser.

We raise the hypothesis that the antennae headdresses of these two pictographs <b>were</b> <b>intentionally</b> <b>hidden.</b> The concealment of peculiar features such as headdresses has never been reported before in Levantine art. We argue that the anthropomorphs with antennae headdresses of this site <b>can</b> <b>be</b> interpreted as the narration of a rite of passage. Some of the physical features of the panel suggest that they were used as a representation of the surrounding landscape. The indicated pictographs, included in the tale of young men being incorporated into adult society, would contribute to the stability and to keep the social order of the human group that produced these images...|$|R

40|$|The {{tools and}} means of the illicit drug trade change over time due to {{technological}} innovation. Consequently, the trade in illicit drugs nowadays also occurs on the dark net â€“ {{that part of the}} internet that <b>is</b> <b>intentionally</b> <b>hidden</b> and requires specific privacy enhancing software to gain access. As a result, governments and law enforcement agencies are faced with a new phenomenon. Several scholars and EU reports have called for a new approach. With this thesis, the application of the current European Framework on illicit drugs is applied to three characteristics of the illicit drug trade on the dark net: the lack of borders, its dependency on conventional postal services and the level of anonymity. This study found that the consequences of these characteristics in the field of jurisdiction, controlled deliveries and privacy do not necessarily constitute problems for the application of the current EU Framework on the illicit drug trade on the dark net...|$|R
