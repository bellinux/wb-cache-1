This behavior has been reported in California and New Mexico. Such an extended period of torpor is close to a state of hibernation, not known among other birds. It was described definitively by Dr. Edmund Jaeger in 1948 based on a poorwill he discovered hibernating in the Chuckwalla Mountains of California in 1946.In 1804, Meriwether Lewis observed hibernating common poorwills in North Dakota during the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Though these observations were recorded carefully in Lewis's journal, their significance was not understood. This was at least in part because the <b>common</b> <b>poorwill</b> was not then recognized as a species distinct from the whip-poor-will of eastern North America. Native Americans of the Hopi tribe were likely aware of the poorwill's behavior even earlier — the Hopílavayi name of this bird, hölchko, means [...] "The Sleeping One".|$|E
50|$|Edmund Carroll Jaeger, D.Sc., (January 28, 1887 - August 2, 1983) was an American {{biologist}} {{known for}} his works on desert ecology. He was born in Loup City, Nebraska to Katherine (née Gunther) and John Philip Jaeger, and moved to Riverside, California in 1906 with his family. He {{was the first to}} document, in The Condor, a state of extended torpor, approaching hibernation, in a bird, the <b>common</b> <b>poorwill.</b> He also described this in the National Geographic Magazine.|$|E

5000|$|Because Cabin Lake Guard Station {{is located}} on the border between the eastern Cascade pine forests and the high desert eco-systems, the guzzler’s water attracts an unusually wide range of birds typical of both environments. [...] Among the birds common to the site are Lewis's woodpecker, white-headed woodpecker, hairy woodpecker, {{northern}} flicker, gray flycatcher, loggerhead shrike, Clark's nutcracker, mourning dove, pygmy nuthatch, Steller's jay, pinyon jay, gray jay, <b>common</b> <b>poorwill,</b> green-tailed towhee, mountain chickadee, Brewer's sparrow, chipping sparrow, white-crowned sparrow, Cassin's finch, red crossbill, mountain bluebird, western bluebird, yellow-rumped warbler, and Townsend's solitaire. [...] Many bird photographs used in Wikipedia articles were taken at the Cabin Lake viewing blind.|$|E
50|$|Bill {{size and}} shape is also important. Compared to the bills of birds {{specialized}} for gleaning, a relatively larger, broader bill is ideal for catching sizeable insects such as bees and flies. The presence of bristles near the bill (rictal bristles) in some flycatchers may be an adaptation for hawking insects; scientists are {{not sure of the}} function but they may help protect the eyes or they might actually help provide the bird sensory information as to the location of the prey. Swallows, swifts, and nightjars do not have large bills, but they have wide-gaping mouths. Some nightjars also have bristles around the bill (the <b>common</b> <b>poorwill</b> does, the common nighthawk does not).|$|E
50|$|Many {{bird species}} {{thrive in the}} Santa Susana Mountains. Perhaps the most common raptors {{observed}} soaring over the brushy, boulder-strewn landscape are turkey vultures, red-tailed hawks, and American kestrels. In oak woodlands {{it is not uncommon}} to see red-shouldered hawks flying from limb to limb. Through the cover of dense, trailside chaparral you might glimpse the California towhee or the colorful rufous-sided towhee, birds who often make their presence known by rustling up leaf litter on the ground. California quail, greater roadrunner, and common raven are also residents of the range. The eerie and enchanting call of the <b>common</b> <b>poorwill</b> can often be heard after dark while quick eyes might observe the silent flight of great horned owls and phantom-like barn owls.|$|E
5000|$|This is the {{smallest}} North American nightjar, about 18 cm in length, with a wingspan of approximately 30 cm. It weighs 36 - 58 g. The sexes are similar, both gray and black patterned above. The outer tail-feathers are tipped with white, the markings slightly more prominent in the male.The <b>common</b> <b>poorwill</b> is told from similar nightjars by its small size, short bill, rounded wings with tips that {{reach the end of}} the short tail at rest, and pale gray coloration. [...] Like many other nightjars, the common name derives from its call, a monotonous poor-will given from dusk to dawn. At close range a third syllable of the call may be heard, resulting in a poor-will-low. It also gives a chuck note in flight.|$|E
50|$|Breeding is from March to August in {{the south}} of the range, and late May to September further north. The nest of the <b>common</b> <b>poorwill</b> is a shallow scrape on the ground, often {{at the base of a}} hill and {{frequently}} shaded partly by a bush or clump of grass. The clutch size is typically two, and the eggs are white to creamy, or pale pink, sometimes with darker mottling. Both sexes incubate for 20-21 days to hatching, with another 20-23 days to fledging. There is usually one brood per year, but females may sometimes lay and incubate a second clutch within 100 m of the first nest while the male feeds young at the first site. The young are semiprecocial. An adult disturbed on the nest tumbles and opens its mouth, hissing, apparently imitating a snake.|$|E
50|$|Birds are common, {{and there}} are 59 species present during at least some years. Seven {{different}} raptors are found, the turkey vulture, American kestrel, golden eagle, ferruginous hawk, red-tailed hawk, Mississippi kite, and the prairie falcon, {{all of which are}} classed as being of least concern according to the IUCN. There is one other bird of prey, the western screech-owl. There are no waterfowl found on Black Mesa. The mourning dove, greater roadrunner, common nighthawk, <b>common</b> <b>poorwill,</b> ladder-backed woodpecker, red-shafted flicker, olive-sided flycatcher, Say's phoebe, ash-throated flycatcher, Cassin's kingbird, and western kingbird are also found. There are five corvids; the black-billed magpie, pinyon jay, American crow, and common raven, as well as the more local Chihuahuan raven.61 species of butterfly are found in the preserve, including seventeen skippers, three swallowtails, four hairstreaks, a copper, four whites, nine true brushfoots, two satyrs, and a leafwing.|$|E
50|$|Hibernation is a {{mechanism}} {{used by many}} mammals to reduce energy expenditure and survive food shortage over the winter. Hibernation may be predictive or consequential. An animal prepares for hibernation by building up {{a thick layer of}} body fat during late summer and autumn that will provide it with energy during the dormant period. During hibernation, the animal undergoes many physiological changes, including decreased heart rate (by as much as 95%) and decreased body temperature. In addition to shivering, some hibernating animal also produce body heat by non-shivering thermogenesis to avoid freezing. Non-shivering thermogenesis is a regulated process in which the proton gradient generated by electron transport in mitochondria is used to produce heat instead of ATP in brown adipose tissue. Animals that hibernate include bats, ground squirrels and other rodents, mouse lemurs, the European hedgehog and other insectivores, monotremes and marsupials. Although hibernation is almost exclusively seen in mammals, some birds, such as the <b>common</b> <b>poorwill,</b> may hibernate.|$|E
50|$|Many {{sleeping}} birds bend {{their heads}} over {{their backs and}} tuck their bills in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather. Perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them {{hold on to the}} perch when they are asleep. Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees. A few parrots of the genus Loriculus roost hanging upside down. Some hummingbirds go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates. This physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species, including owlet-nightjars, nightjars, and woodswallows. One species, the <b>common</b> <b>poorwill,</b> even enters a state of hibernation. Birds do not have sweat glands, but they may cool themselves by moving to shade, standing in water, panting, increasing their surface area, fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves.|$|E
50|$|Continuous aerial feeding is a {{different}} way of hawking insects. It requires long wings and skillful flying, as in nightjars, swallows, and swifts. Swifts are the masters of aerial feeding; they can fly for hours without perching. Swallows, though similar to swifts in shape, are unrelated to swifts. Swallows feed in a similar manner to swifts, but less continuously, as they don't glide as much and they stop to perch for a while between bouts of aerial feeding. This has to do with their prey: swifts fly higher in pursuit of smaller, lighter insects that are scattered by rising air currents, while swallows generally chase after medium-sized insects that are lower to the ground, such as flies. When swallows fly higher to go after smaller insects, they adjust their fight style to glide more, like a swift. Birds of the nightjar family employ a variety of moves for catching insects. The common nighthawk of North America flies in swift-like fashion on its long, slender, pointed wings. The <b>common</b> <b>poorwill,</b> on the other hand, flies low and perches low to the ground and will sally up into the air after insects.|$|E
