5|$|After {{reviewing}} Hamdan's habeas petition, Judge James Robertson of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia {{ruled in}} the detainee's favor. He {{found that the}} United States <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> a military commission unless it was first shown that the detainee was not a prisoner of war.|$|E
5|$|The {{service was}} {{attended}} by many dignitaries from across the United States, and President Hayes ordered all flags to half-staff. Because the church <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> the large crowd, thousands of mourners waited outside and followed in a long procession to witness the burial at Indianapolis's Crown Hill Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Although they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> the city, the 24th Infantry Division {{achieved}} a strategic victory by delaying the North Koreans, providing time for other American divisions {{to establish a}} defensive perimeter around Pusan further south. The delay imposed at Taejon probably prevented an American rout during the subsequent Battle of Pusan Perimeter. During the action, the KPA captured Major General William F. Dean, {{the commander of the}} 24th Infantry Division, and highest ranking American prisoner during the Korean War.|$|E

The brig was old, as you must know, and has long been off of all the Insurance Offices' books; and she <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> <b>hold</b> together much longer. But for this sloop-of-war, I should have put her off on the Mexicans; {{and they would have}} lost her to our people in a month." ...|$|R
5|$|As the {{situation}} around Bihać deteriorated for the ARBiH, {{the government of}} the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina realized that it <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> the area on its own and asked Croatia for military intervention. ARBiH Chief of Staff Rasim Delić appealed to the HV and the HVO to assist the ARBiH 5th Corps on 20 July, proposing HV attacks towards Bosansko Grahovo, Knin and Vojnić. His plea was supported by President of Turkey Süleyman Demirel when he met Croatian President Franjo Tuđman in the Brijuni Islands the next day.|$|E
5|$|Many of Priestley's {{political}} writings {{supported the}} repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, which restricted the rights of Dissenters. They <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> political office, serve in the armed forces, or attend Oxford and Cambridge unless they subscribed to the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England. Dissenters repeatedly petitioned Parliament to repeal the Acts, arguing that they were being treated as second-class citizens.|$|E
5|$|Onassis {{had taken}} his first flying lesson in 1967 and had accrued 1,500 flying hours {{by the time of}} his death. Possessing a {{professional}} pilot's license, he was appointed the President of Olympic Aviation, a regional Greek subsidiary of his father's Olympic Airways, in 1971. Onassis' poor eyesight meant that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> an air transport license, but could possess an air commercial license, allowing him to fly light planes and air taxis for emergency medical cases.|$|E

60|$|When Bob Pillin {{emerged from}} the little front garden of 23, Millicent Villas ten days later, his sentiments were ravelled, and he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> get <b>hold</b> of an end to pull {{straight}} the stuff of his mind.|$|R
5000|$|Secondly the {{function}} of the land in question was being used for a different purpose, and therefore <b>could</b> certainly <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> up under easement terms. Fee simple terms would have permitted this, but the court had already determined that the terms of the contract were certainly under an easement.|$|R
5|$|Just {{after midnight}} on September 6, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was ordered back to Pusan {{in order to}} travel to Japan and merge with other Marine units to form the 1st Marine Division. This was done after a heated {{disagreement}} between Walker's command and MacArthur's command. Walker said he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> the Pusan Perimeter without the Marines in reserve, while MacArthur {{said he could not}} conduct the Inchon landings without the Marines. MacArthur responded by assigning the 17th Infantry Regiment, and later the 65th Infantry Regiment, would be added to Walker's reserves, but Walker did not feel the inexperienced troops would be effective. Walker felt the transition endangered the Perimeter {{at a time when it}} was unclear if it would hold.|$|E
5|$|Lithuania {{had been}} part of the Russian Empire since the {{partitions}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the late 18th century. After the unsuccessful uprising of 1863, Lithuania was subjected to Russification policies: the Lithuanian press ban was initiated, schools were required to teach in the Russian language, Roman Catholics <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> positions in government institutions and could own only limited amounts of land, and political rights were restricted. However, these measures had limited effects on the Lithuanian National Revival, and a sense of the Lithuanian national identity continued to grow. The first Lithuanian political parties, the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania and Lithuanian Democratic Party, included goals of political autonomy for Lithuania within the Russian Empire in their basic program.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, 1992, Armenian forces {{captured}} the mountain stronghold of Shusha but {{remained on the}} defensive until the next year. Fighting between Armenians and Azeris continued {{in other parts of}} the enclave, including Lachin, Khojavend, and Aghdara. However, nearly all offensives launched by Azerbaijan failed or <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> on to captured territory. By the spring of 1993 the Azerbaijani military, which had the upper hand in the initial stages of the war, had been largely reduced to unorganized and incoherent fighting groups. By March 1993 the fighting had shifted to west and south of Karabakh.|$|E

5|$|Saumarez {{immediately}} {{moved to}} engage the French ship and managed to isolate the frigate and subject it to a fierce barrage of fire {{for more than two}} hours. Captain François A. Dénian on Réunion responded, but aside from inflicting minor damage to Saumarez's rigging achieved little while his own vessel was heavily battered, suffering severe damage to rigging masts and hull and more than 80 and possibly as many as 120 casualties. British losses were confined to a single man wounded by an accident aboard Crescent. Eventually Dénian <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> out any longer and was forced to surrender on the arrival of the 28-gun British frigate HMS Circe. Réunion was later repaired and commissioned into the Royal Navy, while Saumarez was knighted for his success.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} still not lost for the Israelis {{although}} the wake was coming, and Laskov considered that his men <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> {{in front of a}} Legion's counter-attack and he preferred to order the retreat. It was also time for the Jordanians to regroup, their 4th Regiment was completely out of ammunition. 73rd Battalion suffered 50% losses and the whole of the engaged forces had counted 44 deaths and twice that number injured. According to the sources, the Legion suffered between 12 and 20 deaths, including the lieutenant commanding the fort. In contrast, the Jordanians reported 2 just deaths on their side, and 161 of the Israelis.|$|E
5|$|The {{date of the}} Gonzaga {{wedding was}} {{repeatedly}} postponed, because of diplomatic problems which delayed the bride's arrival in Mantua until 24 May. The wedding festivities began four days later; L'Arianna was performed on 28 May 1608, {{the first of the}} several spectacular entertainments. A large temporary theatre had been built for the occasion; according to the court's chronicler Federico Follino this held 6,000 people—a figure which Carter deems unlikely. Whatever its size, the arena <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> everyone who wished to be present. Follino's account records that although the duke had strictly limited the numbers from his household entitled to be there, many distinguished foreign visitors could not be seated and were obliged to crowd around the doors.|$|E

50|$|Louis {{was adopted}} by Charles III and legitimised in his royal title. With this legal basis, he sought {{to take the place}} of his Carolingian {{relatives}} on the imperial and Italian thrones in 900. He was crowned in Pavia and then in Rome, but <b>could</b> <b>not</b> actually <b>hold</b> on to power there.|$|R
5|$|Although the {{engagement}} {{did not end}} the First Bulgarian Empire, the Battle of Kleidion reduced its ability to resist Byzantine advances and can be considered the pivotal encounter of the war with Byzantium. The heirs of Samuel <b>could</b> <b>not</b> subsequently <b>hold</b> off the Byzantine advance, and in 1018 the Bulgarian Empire was finally destroyed by Basil II.|$|R
5|$|With Battle Mountain {{in their}} possession, the North Koreans {{set out to}} gain control of P'il-bong to the southeast. In the predawn hours of September 14 a force of 400 to 500 North Korean men {{attacked}} I and L Companies, 24th Infantry, on P'ilbong. Several attacks were repulsed, but because of men leaving their positions L Company's strength dwindled from 100 to 40 men. The remnant of L Company withdrew toward I Company's position on the crest of P'il-bong, only to find that this company under a relatively minor attack had left the hill. They <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> P'il-bong with the handful of men remaining and it was also lost.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, the sheriff of St. George, {{accompanied}} by a posse of 30 men, arrested 25 members of the Miners Union, including Matthew O'Loughlin. As Silver Reef's jail {{was too small to}} hold all 25 prisoners, most of them were jailed in the Rice Building. The Rice Building <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> all of the prisoners, so a line was drawn around the building, and anyone who crossed the line was threatened with shooting. The Miners Union members were transferred to Beaver, where they were tried for riot, conspiracy, and false imprisonment. Thirteen of the members were sentenced to imprisonment; three were bailed out, while ten were sent to the Utah Territorial Penitentiary. Matthew O'Loughlin was sentenced to twenty days in prison and was charged a $75 fine.|$|E
5|$|By this point, the British {{high command}} had {{realised}} that they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> the Germans in southern Norway. The evacuation of Allied troops from Molde and Åndalsnes began, with Ark Royal providing air cover from 30 April. On 1 May, the Germans tried to sink the carrier, with numerous air attacks through the day. Ark Royals fighters {{and a heavy}} anti-aircraft barrage drove off the enemy, and although several bombs were dropped at the carrier, none impacted. The evacuation was completed on 3 May, and the carrier was recalled to Scapa Flow to refuel and rearm before returning to Norway. While in port, Captain Arthur Power left the ship for a promotion to the Admiralty, {{and was replaced by}} Captain Cedric Holland. On return to Norway, Ark Royal was told to provide air cover for operations around Narvik, including the landing of French troops on 13 May. She was joined on 18 May by the carriers Glorious and Furious.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, Stockdale {{moved to}} Rotherham United after a {{successful}} loan spell {{in which he}} scored once against Burnley. He became {{an integral part of}} their defence, but the club and manager Ronnie Moore <b>could</b> <b>not</b> keep <b>hold</b> of Stockdale and several months later, midway through the 2004-05 season he left Rotherham to move to another part of Yorkshire.|$|R

I never knew which of them fell; poor fellow, whichever it was.' ...|$|R
50|$|Blake was {{for several}} years a {{director}} of the London Assurance Company, but had to resign following a debate in the Parliament in 1904. Civil servants <b>could</b> normally <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> such directorships, and though Crown Agents were not technically civil servants, the Colonial Secretary Alfred Lyttelton clarified in a debate in July 1904 that such rules would also apply to them.|$|R
5|$|Five weeks later, Oxbow {{was entered}} in the Grade II mile and one-sixteenth (1,700m) Risen Star Stakes. Ridden {{for the third time}} by Jon Court, Oxbow was {{assigned}} the far outside post at number ten, and was the second favorite at 4–1. He broke fifth from the gate, moved to third passing the stands, but lost ground by being five horses wide around the first turn. In the stretch, Oxbow took the lead but <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> it and finished fourth, although he and the three top-placed horses all ended the race within a length and a half of each other in a blanket finish. The winner was I've Struck a Nerve, at odds of 135–1. Oxbow again progressed in performance, earning a speed figure of 98 and five more points toward Derby qualification.|$|E
5|$|Howard {{immediately}} sent messengers {{to summon}} reinforcements from the III Corps (Maj. Gen. Daniel E. Sickles) and the XII Corps (Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum). Howard's first XI Corps division to arrive, under Maj. Gen. Carl Schurz, was sent north {{to take a}} position on Oak Ridge and link up with the right of the I Corps. (The division was commanded temporarily by Brig. Gen. Alexander Schimmelfennig while Schurz filled in for Howard as XI Corps commander.) The division of Brig. Gen. Francis C. Barlow was placed on Schurz's right to support him. The third division to arrive, under Brig. Gen. Adolph von Steinwehr, was placed on Cemetery Hill along with two batteries of artillery to hold the hill as a rallying point if the Union troops <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> their positions; this placement on the hill corresponded with orders sent earlier in the day to Howard by Reynolds just before he was killed.|$|E
5|$|In 1950-51, he hit 490 runs at {{an average}} of 37.69, {{including}} 100 not out against New South Wales at the SCG. However, he struggled the following season and was dropped, and did not play a single first-class match in 1952-53. His only other first-class centuries came in 195354: 102 against South Australia and 111 against Western Australia. He struggled in the following two summers and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> a consistent position in the team, and retired. Altogether, he made 1,716 first-class runs (mostly as an opener) in 37 matches {{at an average}} of 27.23. A regular choice for the Queensland baseball team, Harvey later turned to cricket umpiring. His initial first-class match as an umpire was in 1974-75 and he stood in two Tests from 1979 to 1980 after many players and officials left for the breakaway World Series Cricket. He stood in six One Day Internationals including one of the finals of the inaugural World Series Cup. In all, he officiated in 31 first-class and 13 List A matches.|$|E
50|$|But {{while running}} for the State Senate, Don Perata was also on the ballot for {{re-election}} to the California State Assembly—and in that race he easily defeated Republican Linda Marshall. Because he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> legally <b>hold</b> a seat {{in both houses of}} the legislature, Perata announced on November 4 that he would resign his Assembly seat as soon as possible.|$|R

60|$|Jane Withersteen {{rushed to}} the silence and {{seclusion}} of her room, and there <b>could</b> <b>not</b> longer <b>hold</b> back the bursting of her wrath.
