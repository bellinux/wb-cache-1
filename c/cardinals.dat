Clement wanted the French <b>cardinals</b> that he created {{to be present in}} Rome and {{to take part in the}} governance of the Church. Henry IV also demanded that three French <b>cardinals</b> go to Rome, and they were present at Clement's death on 3 March 1605.|$|E

The factions broke down relatively evenly amongst the <b>cardinals</b> loyal to Spain and France, with each country controlling eight. Clement IX's nephew Jacopo Rospigliosi's influence in the conclave was relatively weak as Clement IX had only created eight <b>cardinals,</b> whereas Flavio Chigi led twenty-four creations of Alexander VII.|$|E

5|$|After the 1944 season ended, Blake {{enlisted in}} the Army and fought with the 40th Infantry Division in the Pacific Theater of Operations. While in the Philippines, Blake was wounded, and was out of action for nine months as he recovered. As the 1946 season began, he rejoined the <b>Cardinals,</b> now fully recovered, and spent the season with the Columbus <b>Cardinals.</b> Blake started the season losing his first three starts, but then won 13 {{straight}} and finished {{the season with a}} 16 wins, eight losses, and a 3.51 earned run average. In February 1947, Blake was among a group of 92 <b>Cardinals</b> players invited to a dinner for <b>Cardinals</b> minor leaguers, where accusations in regards to <b>Cardinals</b> players being paid poorly were brought up and discussed. He spent the following season playing for both Columbus teams, playing 29 games in total and finishing the season with a combined 4.46 ERA. Before the 1948 season began, Blake was promoted to the Rochester Red Wings of the International League. He had a 7–6 record and a 3.88 ERA in 34 games, seven of them starts. In 1949, Blake spent most of the season playing for Rochester. On August 9, 1949 he was traded by the <b>Cardinals</b> to the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for Mike Schultz, ending his career with the <b>Cardinals.</b> Blake finished the season with the Syracuse Chiefs and finished the season with a combined 5–4 record and a 4.78 ERA.|$|E

5|$|As {{the season}} concluded, the obvious {{standout}} draft choice for both leagues was Alabama quarterback Joe Namath. The Houston Oilers, {{in last place}} in the AFL East, had the number-one pick for the AFL. Both the Oilers and Jets realized that the Jets had a far better chance of signing Namath in competition with the NFL team which drafted him (as it turned out, the St. Louis <b>Cardinals,</b> formerly the Chicago <b>Cardinals),</b> and the Jets were able to acquire the number-one pick. Neither the Jets nor the <b>Cardinals</b> could sign Namath until Alabama played its {{final game of the}} season, the Orange Bowl, on January 1, 1965. Both the Jets and <b>Cardinals</b> negotiated with Namath's attorney, and when the price got too high for the <b>Cardinals,</b> the Giants secretly acquired Namath's NFL rights. Longtime Jets coach Walt Michaels admitted many years later that the Jets had signed Namath days before the game. On January 2, 1965, the Jets held a press conference to announce Namath's signing.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the 15th century, {{the cross}} {{with a double}} {{traverse}} is seen on the arms of archbishops, and relates to their processional cross and the jurisdiction it symbolizes.

5|$|During his pontificate Innocent XIII {{had only}} created three new <b>cardinals.</b> When he died the {{composition}} of the College of <b>Cardinals</b> and its factions were similar to the one that had elected him.

5|$|During the Investiture Controversy, {{both the}} {{legitimate}} Popes {{as well as}} Antipope Clement III developed another, not entirely new, practice. They appointed their <b>cardinals</b> to the important Episcopal sees in Italy in order to assure their government by their own trusted collaborators. Antipope Clement III named <b>cardinals</b> Hugo Candidus and Roberto of S. Marco bishops of Fermo and Faenza respectively. Popes Victor III and Urban II appointed their <b>cardinals</b> to the episcopal sees of Brescia (Herimanus) and Reggio-Emilia (Bonussenior). The practice was continued by successive popes, who named their <b>cardinals</b> particularly to the recently reestablished Latin archiepiscopal sees in southern Italy (Siponto, Brindisi, Salerno, Benevento). Also, three successive archbishops of Pisa: Uberto Rossi Lanfranchi (1133–1137/38), Balduino (1138–1145) and Villano Caetani (1146–1175) were initially the <b>cardinals.</b>|$|E

5|$|It {{lasted for}} five months, from 12 February to 12 July 1691.
