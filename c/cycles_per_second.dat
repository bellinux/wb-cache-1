Frequency of PD tremor is between 4 and 6 hertz (<b>cycles</b> <b>per</b> <b>second).</b> A feature of tremor is pill-rolling, the tendency of the index finger and thumb to touch and perform together a circular movement. The term derives from the similarity between the movement of people with PD and the early pharmaceutical technique of manually making pills.|$|E

5000|$|With the {{organization}} of the International System of Units in 1960, the <b>cycle</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> was officially replaced by the hertz, or reciprocal second.

50|$|A {{special name}} was {{introduced}} for the reciprocal second (s−1) to represent radioactivity to avoid potentially dangerous mistakes with prefixes. For example, 1 µs−1 {{could be taken}} to mean 106 disintegrations per second: 1&middot;(10−6 s)−1 = 106 s−1. Other names considered were hertz (Hz), a special name already in use for the reciprocal second, and fourier (Fr). The hertz is now only used for periodic phenomena.

However, the standard differed between places with alternating current electricity supply at 60 hertz (<b>cycles</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> Hz) and those at 50Hz. Where the mains supply was 60Hz, the actual speed was 78.26rpm: that of a 60Hz stroboscope illuminating 92-bar calibration markings.

25|$|While {{this work}} progressed, the teams {{continued}} {{development of the}} basic system. Burcham and Atkinson continued their development of the transmitter section, attempting to generate very short pulses of power to feed the magnetron. They finally settled on a solution using two tubes, a thyratron and a pentode, which produced 1µs pulses at 15kW. GEC preferred a design using a single thyratron, but this was eventually abandoned in favour of the AMRE design. Further work pushed this system to 50kW, producing 10kW of microwaves at a pulse repetition frequency of 2500 <b>cycles</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{a dynamic}} sense, the {{response}} of a gel to an alternating force (oscillation or vibration) will depend upon the period or frequency of vibration. As indicated here, even most simple liquids will exhibit some elastic response at shear rates or frequencies exceeding 5 x 106 <b>cycles</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> Experiments on such short time scales probe the fundamental motions of the primary particles (or particle clusters) which constitute the lattice structure or aggregate. The increasing resistance of certain liquids to flow at high stirring speeds is one manifestation of this phenomenon. The ability of a condensed body {{to respond to a}} mechanical force by viscous flow is thus strongly dependent on the time scale over which the load is applied, and thus the frequency and amplitude of the stress wave in oscillatory experiments.|$|E

It was determined that the maneuvering load-factor time histories appeared to be described by a truncated normal distribution. The power spectral densities obtained were relatively level at frequencies below 0. 03 <b>cycle</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> and varied inversely with approximately the cube of the frequency at the higher frequencies. In general, the frequency content was very low above 0. 2 <b>cycle</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> The load-factor peak distributions were estimated fairly well from the spectrum analysis.

25|$|Note: angular {{frequency}} ω (ω=2 π f) with the units of radians per second {{is often used}} in equations because it simplifies the equations, but is normally converted to ordinary frequency (units of Hz or equivalently <b>cycles</b> <b>per</b> <b>second)</b> when stating the frequency of a system. If the mass and stiffness {{of the system is}} known, the formula above can determine the frequency at which the system vibrates once set in motion by an initial disturbance. Every vibrating system has one or more natural frequencies that it vibrates at once disturbed. This simple relation can be used to understand in general what happens to a more complex system once we add mass or stiffness. For example, the above formula explains why, when a car or truck is fully loaded, the suspension feels ″softer″ than unloaded—the mass has increased, reducing the natural frequency of the system.|$|E

50|$|The {{frequencies}} quoted {{here are}} based on modern measurements {{and would not have}} been precisely known to musicians of the day. Although Mersenne had made a rough determination of sound frequencies as early as the 17th century, such measurements did not become scientifically accurate until the 19th century, beginning with the work of German physicist Johann Scheibler in the 1830s. The term formerly used for the unit of pitch, <b>cycle</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (CPS) was renamed the hertz (Hz) in the 20th century in honor of Heinrich Rudolf Hertz.|$|R
500|$|In September 1964, Raymon Dones, of El Cerrito, California, {{received}} US patent 3150739 {{which was}} the first patent for a subwoofer specifically designed to augment omni-directionally the low frequency range of modern stereo systems. Able to reproduce distortion-free low frequencies down to 15 <b>cycles</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (15Hz), a specific objective of Dones’ invention was to provide portable sound enclosures capable of high fidelity reproduction of low frequency sound waves without giving an audible indication of the direction from which they emanate. Dones' loudspeaker was marketed in the US under the trade name [...] "The Octavium" [...] from the early 1960s to the mid-1970s. The Octavium was utilized by several recording artists of that era, most notably the Grateful Dead, bassist Monk Montgomery, bassist Nathan East, and the Pointer Sisters. The Octavium speaker and Dones' subwoofer technology was also utilized, in a few select theaters, to reproduce low pitch frequencies for the 1974 blockbuster movie Earthquake. [...] During the late 1960s Dones’ Octavium was favorably reviewed by audiophile publications including Hi-Fi News and Audio Magazine.|$|E
500|$|From 1784 to 1859 the Parisian [...] (concert pitch) rose {{steadily}} from 820 to 896 <b>cycles</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> thus Gluck's French {{version for}} haute-contre became increasingly impractical. When Adolphe Nourrit sang the {{role at the}} Opéra in 1824 his music was altered. Giacomo Meyerbeer suggested to the French contralto Pauline Viardot that she should perform the role of Orfeo. The composer Hector Berlioz {{was a close friend}} of Viardot and the leading expert in France on the music of Gluck. He knew the score of [...] "the largely forgotten Italian original as thoroughly as he knew the French", and agreed to prepare a version of the opera – in four acts – with Viardot's voice in mind, adapting the role of Orphée for a female alto. In his adaptation, Berlioz used the key scheme of the 1762 Vienna score while incorporating much of the additional music of the 1774 Paris score. He returned to the Italian version only when he considered it to be superior either in terms of music or in terms of the drama. He also restored some of the more subtle orchestration from the Italian version and resisted proposals by Viardot and the theatre's director Léon Carvalho to modernize the orchestration. In the end Camille Saint-Saëns, who was acting as Berlioz's assistant on the project, did some of the minor rewriting which Berlioz had declined to do.|$|E
500|$|A {{key feature}} of Sgt. Pepper is Martin and Emerick's liberal use of signal {{processing}} {{to shape the}} sound of the recording, which included the application of dynamic range compression, reverberation and signal limiting. Relatively new modular effects units were used, such as running voices and instruments through a Leslie speaker. Several innovative production techniques feature prominently on the recordings, including direct injection, pitch control and ambiophonics. Another is automatic double tracking (ADT), a system that uses tape recorders to create a simultaneous doubling of a sound. Although it had long been recognised that using multitrack tape to record doubled lead vocals produced an enhanced sound, before ADT it had been necessary to record such vocal tracks twice, a task that was both tedious and exacting. ADT was invented by Townsend during the Revolver sessions in 1966 especially for the Beatles, who disliked tracking sessions and regularly expressed a desire for a technical solution to the problem. The process soon became a common recording practice in popular music. Martin playfully explained to Lennon that his voice had been [...] "treated with a double vibrocated sploshing flange... It doubles your voice, John." [...] Lennon realised that Martin was joking, but from that point on he referred to the effect as flanging, a label that was universally adopted by the music industry. Another important effect was varispeeding. Martin cites [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" [...] as having the most variations of tape speed on Sgt. Pepper. During the recording of Lennon's vocals, the tape speed was reduced from 50 <b>cycles</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> to 45, which produced a higher and thinner-sounding track when played back at the normal speed.|$|E
5000|$|In English, [...] "hertz" [...] is {{also used}} as the plural form. As an SI unit, Hz can be prefixed; {{commonly}} used multiples are kHz (kilohertz, 103 Hz), MHz (megahertz, 106 Hz), GHz (gigahertz, 109 Hz) and THz (terahertz, 1012 Hz). One hertz simply means [...] "one <b>cycle</b> <b>per</b> second" [...] (typically that which is being counted is a complete cycle); 100 Hz means [...] "one hundred <b>cycles</b> <b>per</b> second", and so on. The unit may be applied to any periodic event—for example, a clock might be said to tick at 1 Hz, or a human heart might be said to beat at 1.2 Hz. The occurrence rate of aperiodic or stochastic events is expressed in reciprocal second or inverse second (1/s or s−1) in general or, in the specific case of radioactive decay, in becquerels.

50|$|Cycle {{has several}} {{meanings}} {{in the field}} of music. Acoustically, it refers to one complete vibration, the base unit of Hertz being one <b>cycle</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> Theoretically, an interval cycle is a collection of pitch classes created by a sequence of identical intervals. Individual pieces that aggregate into larger works are considered cycles, for example, the movements of a suite, symphony, sonata, or string quartet. This definition can apply to everything from settings of the Mass or a song cycle to an opera cycle. Cycle also applies to the complete performance of an individual composer's work in one genre.|$|R

Proper subinterval values to maintain stability in PowerWorld Simulator are established for exciter eigenvalue ranges. Subintervals are applied to exciter models of a 16, 386 bus system based on exciter eigenvalues.

50|$|One of the {{difficulties}} posed when broadcasting in the ELF frequency range is antenna size, because {{the length of the}} antenna must be at least a substantial fraction of the length of the waves. Simply put, a 3 Hz (<b>cycle</b> <b>per</b> <b>second)</b> signal would have a wavelength equal to the distance EM waves travel through a given medium in one third of a second. Taking account of refractive index, ELF waves propagate slightly slower than the speed of light in a vacuum. As used in military applications, the wavelength is 299,792 km <b>per</b> <b>second</b> divided by 50-85 Hz, which equals around 3500 to 6000 km long. This is comparable to the Earth's diameter of around 12742 km. Because of this huge size requirement, to transmit internationally using ELF frequencies, the Earth itself forms {{a significant part of the}} antenna, and extremely long leads are necessary into the ground. Various means, such as electrical lengthening, are used to construct practical radio stations with smaller sizes.|$|R

Re-writing sines and cosines as complex exponentials makes it necessary for the Fourier coefficients to be complex valued. The usual interpretation of this complex number is that it gives both the amplitude (or size) of the wave present in the function and the phase (or the initial angle) of the wave. These complex exponentials sometimes contain negative [...] "frequencies".
