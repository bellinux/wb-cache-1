500|$|According to Andrew Kelham, Daybreaker is an [...] "urgent and resurgent" [...] record; it {{has been}} {{identified}} by critics as metalcore, progressive metal, mathcore and post-hardcore. Architects have been credited for fusing the intense technicality and metallic style of Hollow Crown with the [...] "soaring vocals" [...] and the much improved production of The Here and Now. The album is defined {{by a number of}} features, including a contrast of singing and extreme metal screaming, and melodic choruses complemented by [...] "soaring" [...] vocals, technical guitar work with palm muted breakdowns and the use of string instruments and piano to generate atmosphere. Daybreaker is noted for fusing influences from Architects' previous two albums The Here And Now and Hollow Crown; many reviewers have cited the album as a return to the band's heavier, more technical roots. When he interviewed the band, Kelham wrote, [...] "some will see Daybreaker as an apology, but it's not. Others will view it as a hasty attempt to <b>claw</b> <b>back</b> the glories of third album Hollow Crown, but it's not that either. It's a collection of songs about moving on, growing up and making sense of what has come before".|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1997, former European Cup winner and Dutch international, Wim Jansen, became head coach. Despite losing his first two games of the season, Jansen quickly turned things round and won the club's first Scottish League Cup in 15 years when they beat Dundee United 3–0 in the final. A tightly fought league {{campaign}} saw Celtic clinch the title {{on the final day}} of the season, stopping Rangers' bid for 10 league titles in a row. [...] However it had by then become known that Jansen was disgruntled with Celtic Managing Director, Jock Brown, and he quit in the immediate aftermath of Celtic's title win. Veteran Slovak coach Jozef Vengloš arrived at Celtic for the following season. A poor start to the season put Vengloš under pressure, but the arrival of new signings and a 5–1 win over Rangers in the league gave rise to optimism. However the league deficit was too much to <b>claw</b> <b>back</b> and a Scottish Cup final defeat to Rangers sealed a largely disappointing season. [...] The summer of 1999 saw the arrival of Kenny Dalglish as Director of Football and John Barnes as head coach. A bright start soon faded as Celtic began to drop vital points in the league. A shock Cup defeat at home to Inverness Caledonian Thistle saw Barnes sacked and Dalglish taking over as caretaker manager for the rest of the season. Celtic did win the League Cup, but slumped in the league and finished 21 points behind winner's Rangers.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{highlights}} of the law was a provision that allowed the SEC to force a company's CEO or CFO to disgorge any executive compensation (such as bonus pay or proceeds from stock sales) earned within a year of misconduct that results in an earnings restatement. [...] However, according to Gretchen Morgenson of The New York Times, such clawbacks have actually been rare, {{due in part to the}} requirement that the misconduct must be either deliberate or reckless. [...] The SEC did not attempt to <b>claw</b> <b>back</b> any executive compensation until 2007, and as of December 2013 had only brought 31 cases, 13 of which were begun after 2010. [...] However, according to Dan Whalen of the accounting research firm Audit Analytics, the threat of clawbacks, and the time-consuming litigation associated with them, has forced companies to tighten their financial reporting standards.|$|E

2500|$|Welsh took a {{break away}} from boxing after winning the Lonsdale belt, earning good money making {{theatrical}} appearances at music halls in London, but a chance meeting with Packy McFarland led to a match being arranged between them. Welsh warmed up for the bout with a win over Jack Daniels, before facing McFarland for the third time, now on British soil at Covent Garden. The match was billed as the [...] "Light-weight Championship of the World", but that title was now held by Ad Wolgast who had beaten Battling Nelson in a shock win in February. McFarland started the fight well, and most reporters gave him the first nine rounds, after that Welsh took most of the rounds, though {{in the eyes of}} the British press he failed to <b>claw</b> <b>back</b> the advantage McFarland had opened up in the early rounds. The result after twenty rounds was a draw, the British newspapers reported that McFarland had been robbed of a victory.|$|E
2500|$|Australian driver Colin Bond, {{winner of}} the 1975 Australian Touring Car Championship and 1969 Hardie-Ferodo 500, had been racing the GTV6 model since 1984 and stayed loyal to Alfa Romeo, running a Caltex {{sponsored}} Alfa 75 in the 1987 Australian Touring Car Championship to replace the GTV6. Bond's new 75 was built by the Italian Luigi team, but Bond found the engine it came with only produced about [...] instead of the 320 bhp it should have. This saw him finish a distant 9th place in the championship while the team's engine builder, Melbourne based Alfa expert tuner Joe Beninca, tried to <b>claw</b> <b>back</b> the extra power. This was achieved after the car was converted to right hand drive which allowed an exhaust system to be fitted that didn't wind its way around the steering rack. Bond also drove the end of season endurance races which included the Bathurst round of the WTCC. After Bond qualified the car in 21st, co-driver Lucio Cesario destroyed {{the front of the}} 75 in a crash {{at the top of the}} mountain on lap 34 of the race which forced the cars withdrawal from the Calder Park and Wellington rounds of the WTCC. The car was repaired in time for the Australian Grand Prix support races in Adelaide where Bond qualified a fine second and finished 5th in the race in the cars 'down under' swansong as Bond, the only driver to embrace the 75 in Australia, switched to race the all-conquering Ford Sierra RS500 from 1988 in a bid to return to the winners circle.|$|E

2500|$|Legal capital must be {{maintained}} (not distributed to shareholders, or distributed [...] "in disguise") unless a company formally reduces its legal capital. Then it can make distributions, which might be desirable if a company wishes to shrink. A private company must have a 75 per cent vote of the shareholders, and the directors must then warrant that the company will remain solvent and {{will be able to}} pay its debts. If this {{turns out to be a}} negligent statement, the director can be sued. But this means it is hard to <b>claw</b> <b>back</b> any profits from shareholders if a company does indeed go insolvent, if the director's statement appeared good at the time. If not all the directors are prepared to make a solvency statement, the company may apply to court for a decision. In public companies, a special resolution must also be passed, and a court order is necessary. The court can make a number of orders, for example that creditors should be protected with security interest. There is a general principle that shareholders must be treated equally in making capital reductions, however this does not mean that unequally situated shareholders must be treated the same. In particular, while no ordinary shareholder should lose shares disproportionately, it has been held legitimate to cancel preferential shares before others, particularly if those shares are entitled to preferential payment as a way of considering [...] "the position of the company itself as an economic entity". Economically, companies buying their own shares back from shareholders would achieve the same effect as a reduction of capital. Originally it was prohibited by the common law, but now although the general rule remains in section 658 there are two exceptions. First, a company may issue shares on terms that they may be redeemed, though only if there is express authority in the constitution of a public company, and the re-purchase can only be made from distributable profits. Second, since 1980 shares can simply be bought back from shareholders if, again this is done out of distributable profits. Crucially, the directors must also state that the company will be able to pay all its debts and continue for the next year, and shareholders must approve this by special resolution. Under the Listing Rules for public companies, shareholders must generally be given the same buy back offer, and get shares bought back pro rata. How many shares are retained by the company as treasury shares or cancelled must be reported to Companies House. From the company's perspective the legal capital is being reduced, hence the same regulation applies. From the shareholder's perspective, the company buying back some of its shares is much the same as simply paying a dividend, except for one main difference. Taxation of dividends and share buy backs tends to be different, meaning that often buy backs are popular just because they [...] "dodge" [...] the Exchequer.|$|E
