In T 1 -weighted MRI of the olfactory bulb, hippocampus and cerebellum, contrast obtained by the intracranial administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) reflects the extra- and intracellular spaces of gray matter in agreement with histological data.

5|$|Once {{the food}} is in the {{digestive}} cavity, gland cells in the gastroderm release enzymes that reduce the prey to slurry, usually within a few hours. This circulates through the digestive cavity and, in colonial cnidarians, through the connecting tunnels, so that gastroderm cells can absorb the nutrients.

5|$|The rostral migratory stream (RMS) is a {{specialized}} migratory route {{found in the}} brain of some animals along which neuronal precursors that originated in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the brain migrate to reach the main olfactory bulb (OB). The importance of the RMS lies {{in its ability to}} refine and even change an animal's sensitivity to smells, which explains its importance and larger size in the rodent brain as compared to the human brain, as our olfactory sense is not as developed.

5|$|Commelina communis is {{also used}} as a model {{organism}} in plant physiology and plant development to a limited extent, especially in relation to stomatal physiology and the biology of pigmentation development. For example, the blue pigmentation of Asiatic dayflower petals was shown to consist of a large complex of six anthocyanins, six flavones, and two associated magenesium ions, demonstrating that supramolecular complexes of several copigments and chelated metals often determine colour. Other research on the plant has helped to explain photoreceptor systems in plants such as their stomatal responses to blue light versus red light spectrums, abscisic acid perception {{and its role in}} cell signaling, particularly concerning the chemical's role in stomatal function, the role of vanadates in inhibiting stomatal opening, and the necessity of calcium in stomatal closure, among other topics. Its widespread use in stomatal studies {{is due to the fact}} that the leaves produce exceptional epidermal peels that are consistently one <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> thick. This same quality makes the plant popular for use in laboratory exercises in higher education for demonstrating stomatal function and morphology. Guard cell turgor pressure and its regulation in the opening and closing of stomata is particularly easy to demonstrate with the Asiatic dayflower.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Grapevine {{can be a}} {{periclinal}} chimera plant {{which is}} composed at least of two distinct <b>cell</b> <b>layers</b> (L 1, L 2). When the <b>cell</b> <b>layers</b> of this plant are separated by passage through somatic embryogenesis, regenerated plants could show distinct DNA profiles and a novel phenotype which proved {{different from that of}} the parent plant. Results Genetically Chardonnay clone 96 is a periclinal chimera plant in which is L 1 and L 2 <b>cell</b> <b>layers</b> are distinct. Plants obtained via organogenesis through meristematic bulks are shown to be composed of both <b>cell</b> <b>layers.</b> However, plants regenerated through somatic embryogenesis starting from anthers or nodal explants are composed only of L 1 cells. These somaclones do not show phenotypic differences to the parental clone up to three years after regeneration. Interestingly, the only somaclone showing an atypical phenotype (asymmetric leave) shows a genotypic modification. Conclusion These results suggest that the phenotype of Chardonnay 96 does not result from an interaction between the two distinct <b>cell</b> <b>layers</b> L 1 and L 2. If phenotype conformity is further confirmed, somatic embryogenesis will result in true-to-type somaclones of Chardonnay 96 and would be well suitable for gene transfer. </p...|$|R

25|$|Transduction is {{the process}} through which energy from {{environmental}} stimuli is converted to neural activity for the brain to understand and process. The back of the eye contains three different cell layers: photoreceptor layer, bipolar <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> and ganglion <b>cell</b> <b>layer.</b> The photoreceptor layer {{is at the very}} back and contains rod photoreceptors and cone photoreceptors. Cones are responsible for color perception. There are three different cones: red, green and blue. Rods, are responsible for the perception of objects in low light. Photoreceptors contain within them a special chemical called a photopigment, which are embedded in the membrane of the lamellae; a single human rod contains approximately 10 million of them. The photopigment molecules consist of two parts: an opsin (a protein) and retinal (a lipid). There are 3 specific photopigments (each with their own color) that respond to specific wavelengths of light. When the appropriate wavelength of light hits the photoreceptor, its photopigment splits into two, which sends a message to the bipolar <b>cell</b> <b>layer,</b> which in turn sends a message to the ganglion cells, which then send the information through the optic nerve to the brain. If the appropriate photopigment is not in the proper photoreceptor (for example, a green photopigment inside a red cone), a condition called color vision deficiency will occur.|$|E

Here, this pattern is reported {{at the level of}} each of the <b>cell</b> <b>layers</b> or groups of <b>cell</b> <b>layers</b> composing the pericarp, except for vascular bundles. Overall, cell division and cell expansion occurred at similar rates for 9 days post anthesis (DPA), with very specific patterns according to the <b>layers.</b> Subsequently, only <b>cell</b> expansion continued for up to 3 - 4 more weeks.

The mutation exist only in the outermost <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> of the cultivar, the L1 or 'epidermal' layer, meaning Pinot Meunier is a chimera.

The mutants could not produce full-grown tendrils, it seems that gibberellic acid converts grapevine flower buds into tendrils.|$|E

500|$|The {{epidermis}} is {{the most}} superficial layer of skin, a squamous epithelium with several strata: the stratum corneum, stratum lucidum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale.

[...] The epidermis contains four cell types: keratinocytes, melanocytes, Langerhans cells, and Merkel cells. Of these, keratinocytes are the major component, constituting roughly 95 percent of the epidermis. [...] This stratified squamous epithelium is maintained by cell division within the stratum basale, in which differentiating cells slowly displace outwards through the stratum spinosum to the stratum corneum, where cells are continually shed from the surface. [...] In normal skin, the rate of production equals the rate of loss; about two weeks are needed for a cell to migrate from the basal <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> {{to the top of}} the granular <b>cell</b> <b>layer,</b> and an additional two weeks to cross the stratum corneum.|$|E

2500|$|The body cavity {{is known}} as a [...] "pseudocoel", or haemocoel. Unlike a true coelom, a pseudocoel is not fully {{enclosed}} by a <b>cell</b> <b>layer</b> derived from the embryonic mesoderm. A coelom is, however, formed around the gonads and the waste-eliminating nephridia. As the name haemocoel suggests, the body cavity is filled with a blood-like liquid in which all the organs are embedded; in this way, they can be easily supplied with nutrients circulating in the blood. This liquid is colourless as it does not contain pigments; for this reason, it only serves a limited role in oxygen transport. Two different types of blood cells (or haemocytes) circulate in the fluid: amoebocytes and nephrocytes. The amoebocytes probably function in protection from bacteria and other foreign bodies; in some species, they also play a role in reproduction. Nephrocytes absorb toxins or convert them into a form suitable for elimination by the nephridia. The haemocoel is divided by a horizontal partition, the diaphragm, into two parts: the pericardial sinus along the back and the perivisceral sinus along the belly. The former encloses the tube-like heart, and the latter, the other organs. The diaphragm is perforated in many places, enabling the exchange of fluids between the two cavities. The heart itself is a tube of annular muscles consisting of epithelial tissues, with two lateral openings (...) per segment. While it is not known whether the rear end is open or closed, from the front, it opens directly into the body cavity. Since there are no blood vessels, apart from the fine vessels running between the muscle layers of the body wall and a pair of arteries that supply the antennae, this is referred to as an open circulation. The timing of the pumping procedure can be divided into two parts: diastole and systole. During diastole, blood flows through the ostia from the pericardial sinus (the cavity containing the heart) into the heart. When the systole begins, the ostia close and the heart muscles contract inwards, reducing the volume of the heart. This pumps the blood from {{the front end of the}} heart into the perivisceral sinus containing the organs. In this way, the various organs are supplied with nutrients before the blood finally returns to the pericardial sinus via the perforations in the diaphragm. In addition to the pumping action of the heart, body movements also have an influence on circulation.|$|E
