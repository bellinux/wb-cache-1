40|$|A {{considerable}} {{proportion of}} the general public experiences negative health effects triggered by certain components contained in their habitual diet. Susceptible persons can develop an intolerance, e. g. against lactose, {{due to the lack of}} a digestive enzyme, some can not tolerate certain food additives or increased levels of certain amino acids, e. g. glutamate, and others suffer from adverse reactions mediated by the immune system. The latter is characterised by the action of IgE antibodies against the offending food and is known as food allergy. The symptoms caused by allergic reactions range from rather mild manifestations (urticaria) to life threatening events (anaphylactic shock). Therapeutic approaches to treat food allergies have been tried with variable success. Usually the recommended option is to eliminate from the diet the food(s) or food ingredients to which hypersensitivity has been found. Allergic persons need to know whether the food items they purchase contain allergenic ingredients; they have to rely on the truthfulness of information given on the label of prepared and packaged food items. National and supra-national legislation has been put in place which requires food business operators to declare whether ingredients with a known allergenic potential have been used during manufacturing. The Codex Alimentarius General Standard for the Labelling of Prepacked Food requires, for example, the mandatory labelling of the presence of eight classes of food ingredients that are known to cause hypersensitivity in susceptible consumers (<b>cereals</b> <b>containing</b> <b>gluten,</b> crustaceans, eggs, fish, peanuts, soybeans, milk, and tree nuts), while European Community legislation (Commission Directive 2007 / 68 /EC) extends the list to include also celery, mustard, sesame seeds, lupin, and molluscs. Analytical testing systems are needed by the food industry to enable them to test whether allergens are present in their raw materials, the finished products and whether production lines have been correctly sanitised, by the food inspection authorities for market surveillance and by academia to enable and stimulate research into food allergy and allergen detection. In this issue of Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry we attempted bringing together views from different angles. The majority of the reviews and original contributions focus on analytical aspects; however, biochemical, immunological and clinical aspects are covered as well. JRC.

40|$|Celiac Disease (CD) is an immune-mediated {{disease in}} genetically {{susceptible}} individuals caused by intolerance to gluten protein in some cereals, resulting in mucosal inflammation, which causes malabsorption. An effective treatment for CD is a gluten-free diet that excludes <b>cereals</b> <b>containing</b> <b>gluten.</b> One {{of the most}} desirable wheat products is the cookie, which is considered suitable for all ages due to its low manufacturing cost, convenience, long shelf life and good eating quality. Therefore, the production of local, high quality and affordable gluten-free cookies was the main objective of this study in which lupine flour {{was used as a}} main wheat flour alternative. Eight gluten-free cookie flour blends were prepared: 100 % Lupine Flour (AF), 50 % lupine flour and 50 % corn starch (BF), 40 % lupine flour and 60 % corn starch (CF), 30 % lupine flour and 70 % corn starch (DF), 30 % lupine flour, 40 % rice flour and 30 % corn starch (EF), 30 % lupine flour, 40 % corn flour and corn starch 30 % (FF), 20 % lupine flour, 30 % corn flour, 20 % rice flour and 30 % corn starch (GF) and 20 % lupine flour, 30 % rice flour, 20 % corn flour and 30 % corn starch (HF), with equal amounts of hydrocolloids (1. 5 % xanthan and 1. 5 % carrageenan) which were used as a functional gluten alternative, as well as a control sample with Wheat flour (WC). The chemical composition, physical characteristics and sensory evaluation of all treated flour blends and cookies were determined. The results of the chemical analysis indicated that corn and wheat flour were significantly (p≤ 0. 05) higher in moisture content, while lupine flour had significantly (p≤ 0. 05) higher contents of lipid, protein, fiber and ash. Starch significantly (p≤ 0. 05) showed the highest carbohydrate content. The moisture of blend BC was significantly (p≤ 0. 05) higher than all blends and blend AC was significantly (p≤ 0. 05) higher in ash, protein, lipid and fiber content. The carbohydrate content of blend DC was significantly (p≤ 0. 05) higher than the other blends, in which blend AC significantly (p≤ 0. 05) contained the lowest amount. Physical analysis revealed that the spread factor of blend GC was significantly (p≤ 0. 05) higher than the other blends, while blend CC significantly (p≤ 0. 05) had the lowest value. The results of color measurements (L*, a* and b*) using a Milolat colorimeter revealed that the L* parameter had the highest value in the control sample WC, while the a* parameter was highest in blend AC and b* was highest in blend EC. The results of the sensory evaluation, judged by panelists, indicated that blend BC received the highest score in overall impression, while the control sample WC received the overall highest score in flavor and crust color, blend GC in overall color and the control sample WC in overall texture, blend AC in crust color, crumb color, hardness and after taste. Finally, blends BC and GC had the best acceptability compared to the control sample...|$|E

40|$|Celiac disease (CD) is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disease affecting the small intestinal mucosa. The causative agents {{have been identified}} as gluten proteins from wheat, barley and rye, and the only available treatment for CD patients is a lifelong gluten-free diet. Non-gluten <b>containing</b> <b>cereals</b> would be a valuable contribution to the gluten-free diet. In this respect, oats are a good choice. However, commercial lots of oat flakes and flour frequently are contaminated with wheat, barley and rye, and two studies have reported that some peptides derived from the gluten-like avenin storage proteins of oat can trigger an immune response in some CD patients. In the present study we have initiated the investigation whether all oat varieties contain similar amounts of potentially harmful sequences by biochemical and immunological methods. We confirm that commercial oat preparations are contaminated with other <b>cereals</b> that <b>contain</b> <b>gluten</b> or gluten-like proteins. Moreover, our results demonstrate that contamination-free oat varieties differ in their capacity to stimulate an avenin-sensitive gamma-gliadin specific T cell line derived from a patient with CD, indicative for differences in the two known avenin epitopes among oat varieties, implying that selection and breeding of completely safe oat varieties for all CD patients may be a realistic possibility...|$|R
40|$|New ways {{of making}} bread from cassava and sorghum could reduce the {{dependence}} of the Third World on imported wheat for white bread, according to FAO, who have been researching this for two years. Traditional staples have been rejected in developing countries {{over the years as}} they do not make an attractive, longlasting bread, partly because few other <b>cereals</b> <b>contain</b> sufficient <b>gluten.</b> Now FAO scientists have succeeded in making acceptable loaves from cassava or sorghum flour using xanthan as a gluten substitute: These breads especially cassava, stay fresh longer and taste better than wheat bread, and the batterlike dough can also be proved (made to rise) using the same methods. Now FAO, with the National Institute of Nutrition in Rome and the Institute for Bakery Research in Detmold, Germany, is experimenting with other methods that will give the vital stable but flexible cell wall that will retain the carbon dioxide bubbles produced by yeast - such as partially cooking cassava flour with water before the bread-making process, and adding egg-white or legume flour to 'set' the dough. Research is continuing, and it seems likely that soon rice, millet, maize, roots, tubers, as well as cassava and sorghum could be used in bread production either domestically or commercially, with profound implications for developing countries.

40|$|Bioethanol {{can be used}} as {{motor fuel}} and/or as a {{gasoline}} enhancer. A high yield feedstock for bioethanol production is cereal grain. <b>Cereal</b> grains <b>containing</b> less <b>gluten</b> proteins (glutenin and gliadin), but high starch, are favoured by distillers because they increase the bioethanol conversion. The direct effect of wheat gluten proteins on bioethanol yield was studied on triticale grain. Examined triticale Presto 1 R. 1 D 5 + 10 - 2 and Presto Valdy were developed by introducing selected segments of wheat chromosome 1 D into triticale chromosome 1 R. Even if the samples analysed in this study do not afford to make definitive assumptions, it can be noticed that in analysed cases the presence of gliadin had more significant effect on investigated parameters than the presence of glutenin. Despite the presence of glutenin subunits did not significantly decrease the investigated parameters - specific weight, Hagberg falling number and starch content in grain met the requirements for grain for bioethanol production - protein content was higher than is optimal. The fermentation experiments demonstrated good bioethanol yields but depression in grain yields caused by the presence of wheat gliadin and glutenin decreased the energy balance of Presto Valdy and Presto 1 R. 1 D 5 + 10 - 2.
