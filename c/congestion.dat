5|$|<b>Congestion</b> pricing or <b>congestion</b> charges is {{a system}} of {{surcharging}} users of public goods that are subject to <b>congestion</b> through excess demand such as higher peak charges for use of bus services, electricity, metros, railways, telephones, and road pricing to reduce traffic congestion; airlines and shipping companies may be charged higher fees for slots at airports and through canals at busy times. This pricing strategy regulates demand, {{making it possible to}} manage <b>congestion</b> without increasing supply. Market economics theory, which encompasses the <b>congestion</b> pricing concept, postulates that users will be forced to pay for the negative externalities they create, making them conscious of the costs they impose upon each other when consuming during the peak demand, and more aware of their impact on the environment.|$|E
5|$|Experience {{from the}} few cities where <b>congestion</b> pricing has been {{implemented}} shows that {{social and political}} acceptability is key. Public discontent with <b>congestion</b> pricing, or rejection of <b>congestion</b> pricing proposals, is due mainly to the inequality issues, the economic burden on neighboring communities, the effect on retail businesses and the economic activity in general, and the fears that the revenues will become just another tax.|$|E
5|$|Implementation of <b>congestion</b> pricing {{has reduced}} <b>congestion</b> in urban areas, but has also sparked {{criticism}} and public discontent. Critics maintain that <b>congestion</b> pricing is not equitable, places an economic burden on neighboring communities, {{has a negative}} effect on retail businesses and on economic activity in general, and represents another tax levy.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that power system {{operations}} are often constrained by transmission <b>congestions</b> which reflect the physical restrictions intrinsic to the power system itself. The power market running on top of the system is also constrained by factors such as primary energy, emissions, technical support, as well as multi-player gaming among market participants including regulators. In this paper, we propose a new concept of generalized <b>congestions</b> to describe those factors affecting both the competition level and the efficiency of power markets. Market power is a market participant's capability in influencing market efficiency with the aid of generalized congestions; generalized market power reflects its capability to influence the social welfare. This paper analyzes generalized <b>congestions,</b> market power and generalized market power in many aspects including taxonomy, evaluation indexes, control measures. and the corresponding research methods. Based on the experimental economics method, a research framework is proposed to facilitate comprehensive studies on the influences of generalized <b>congestions</b> on market power...|$|R

Hence, the maximum attempt probability should be bounded when the maximum backlog is increasing, so that the sparse transmission constraint can be guaranteed. Otherwise, high attempt probabilities could decrease the successful transmission probabilities and consequently cause <b>congestions.</b> And the <b>congestions</b> may significantly increase the queue, causing even higher attempt probabilities due to the retransmissions.|$|R
5|$|Practical {{implementations}} of road <b>congestion</b> pricing {{are found}} {{almost exclusively in}} urban areas, because traffic <b>congestion</b> is common in and around city centers. Autoroute A1 in Northern France {{is one of the}} few cases of <b>congestion</b> pricing implemented outside of urban areas. This is an expressway connecting Paris to Lille, and since 1992 <b>congestion</b> prices have been applied during weekends with the objective of spreading demand on the trip back to Paris on Sunday afternoons and evenings. As <b>congestion</b> pricing has been increasing worldwide, the schemes implemented have been classified into four different types: cordon area around a city center; area wide <b>congestion</b> pricing; city center toll ring; and corridor or single facility <b>congestion</b> pricing.|$|E
5|$|<b>Congestion</b> pricing {{has also}} been {{implemented}} in urban freeways. Between 2004 and 2005, Santiago de Chile implemented the first 100% non-stop urban toll for a freeway passing through a downtown area, charging by the distance traveled. <b>Congestion</b> pricing has been used since 2007 during rush hours {{in order to maintain}} reasonable speeds within the city core.|$|E
5|$|Cordon area <b>congestion</b> pricing is a fee or {{tax paid}} by users {{to enter a}} {{restricted}} area, usually within a city center, {{as part of a}} demand management strategy to relieve traffic <b>congestion</b> within that area. The economic rationale for this pricing scheme is based on the externalities or social costs of road transport, such as air pollution, noise, traffic accidents, environmental and urban deterioration, and the extra costs and delays imposed by traffic <b>congestion</b> upon other drivers when additional users enter a congested road.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, Airbus {{estimated}} {{a demand}} for 1,283 VLA in the following 20 years if airport <b>congestion</b> remains constant, up to 1,771 VLAs if <b>congestion</b> increases, with most deliveries (56%) in Asia-Pacific, and 415 very large, 120-tonne plus freighters. For the same period, Boeing was estimating the demand for 590 large (B747 or A380) passenger airliners and 630 freighters.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{ten years}} since its implementation, TfL {{reported}} that the <b>congestion</b> charging scheme resulted in a 10% reduction in traffic volumes from baseline conditions, and an overall reduction of 11% in vehicle kilometres in London between 2000 and 2012. Despite these gains, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network {{in order to improve}} the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, as well as an increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. TfL concludes that while levels of <b>congestion</b> in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the <b>congestion</b> charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the <b>Congestion</b> Charging scheme.|$|E

30|$|The strong {{relationship}} between road IA and ADETT is clearly seen for all city sizes. For metropolises, the increase of rail infrastructure shows a similar de- congestionating effect than an increase in road infrastructure, while for small cities rail infrastructure is less correlated with <b>congestions.</b> One hypothesis could be that smaller cities are less congested and there is less pressure to change from car to rail. These results confirm the previously mentioned finding that rail infrastructure has a relaxation effect on road traffic for metropolises [7, 29, 47], presumably by shifting car trips to rail trips. Combining the relations between road/rail IA, <b>congestions</b> and GDP per capita, it could be hypothesized that economically strong metropolises can afford to expand road, rail and bicycle infrastructure and are more successful in reducing <b>congestions.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes two {{approaches}} for a unified management of <b>congestions</b> due to voltage instability and thermal overload in a deregulated environment. Both techniques aim to remove, in some optimal manner, voltage and thermal <b>congestions</b> stemming from base case or post-contingency states, by a simultaneous handling of operating and security constraints {{with respect to}} several contingencies. The objective of the first approach is to adjust the market-based power injections (generator output and possibly load consumption) at the least cost while the second one aims at curtailing power transactions in a transparent and non-discriminatory way. These techniques rely on sensitivities which pinpoint the best remedial actions against <b>congestions</b> owing to voltage instability and thermal overload. Numerical results with both approaches are provided on a realistic 80 -bus system model. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|R

30|$|In [1], a novel concept, {{called the}} “generalized congestions” was {{proposed}} to describe those factors affecting both the competition {{level and the}} efficiency of power markets. Market power {{is defined as the}} market participant’s capability to influence the market efficiency with the aid of generalized <b>congestions,</b> and generalized market power reflects its capability to influence the social welfare. Regulation measures, like other generalized <b>congestions,</b> could influence the energy and capital flows in power systems. Thus, the regulation power is a special market power, which can also reduce market efficiency if it is not well designed.|$|R

5|$|According to the {{economic}} theory behind <b>congestion</b> pricing, {{the objective of this}} policy is the use of the price mechanism to make users more aware of the costs that they impose upon one another when consuming during the peak demand, and that they should pay for the additional <b>congestion</b> they create, thus encouraging the redistribution of the demand in space or in time, or shifting it to the consumption of a substitute public good; for example, switching from private transport to public transport.|$|E

In 1925, the Ministry of Transport convened a conference between Surrey and Middlesex county councils with the aim of reaching a solution to the <b>congestion</b> problem, and the Great Chertsey Road scheme was revived. In 1927, the Royal Commission on Cross-River Traffic approved the scheme to relieve the by then chronic traffic <b>congestion</b> on the existing, mostly narrow, streets in the area, and on the narrow bridges at Richmond Bridge, Kew and Hammersmith.
