The <b>current</b> <b>measurement</b> of {{the age of the}} universe is [...] billion (109) years within the Lambda-CDM concordance model. The uncertainty has been narrowed down to 21 million years, based on a number of projects that all give extremely close figures for the age. These include studies of the microwave background radiation, and measurements by the Planck satellite, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and other probes. Measurements of the cosmic background radiation give the cooling time of the universe since the Big Bang, and measurements of the expansion rate of the universe can be used to calculate its approximate age by extrapolating backwards in time.|$|E
2500|$|An aneroid {{barometer}} is {{an instrument for}} measuring pressure as a method that does not involve liquid. Invented in 1844 by French scientist Lucien Vidi, the {{aneroid barometer}} uses a small, flexible metal box called an aneroid cell (capsule), which is made from an alloy of beryllium and copper. The evacuated capsule (or usually several capsules, stacked to add up their movements) is prevented from collapsing by a strong spring. Small changes in external air pressure cause the cell to expand or contract. [...] This expansion and contraction drives mechanical levers such that the tiny movements of the capsule are amplified and displayed {{on the face of}} the aneroid barometer. [...] Many models include a manually set needle which is used to mark the <b>current</b> <b>measurement</b> so a change can be seen. [...] In addition, the mechanism is made deliberately [...] "stiff" [...] so that tapping the barometer reveals whether the pressure is rising or falling as the pointer moves. This type of barometer is common in homes and in recreational boats, as well as small aircraft. It is also used in meteorology, mostly in barographs and as a pressure instrument in radiosondes.|$|E

If the voltage and <b>current</b> <b>measurements</b> are not collocated, the power measurements will be incorrect. In this paper, a correction is calculated for noncollocated voltage and <b>current</b> <b>measurements</b> used to obtain power. The correction is obtained utilizing the non-collocated power and one voltage magnitude measurement. One application area is in state estimation sensory inputs.

5000|$|Direct {{current is}} used in the Coulter {{counters}} found in most research and cell laboratories. Direct <b>current</b> <b>measurements</b> are useful for an array of particles and allow for simplified data acquisition and processing. Alternating <b>current</b> <b>measurements</b> are sometimes used in clinical hematology instruments, due to the special nature of cell membranes. At low frequencies (below 500 kHz), alternating and direct <b>current</b> <b>measurements</b> behave essentially the same way. At intermediate frequencies (500 kHz - 6 MHz), the plasma membrane of cells can become polarized, leading to a decreased capacitance of the measurement systems. However, at high frequencies (6-20 MHz), the cell membrane loses its polarization, and the electrical pulses provide information about the cell cytoplasm.|$|R
