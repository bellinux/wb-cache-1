40|$|High-accuracy {{continuous}} {{measurements of}} greenhouse gases (CO 2 and CH 4) during the BARCA (Balancao Atmosferico Regional de Carbono na Amazonia) phase B campaign in Brazil in May 2009 were accomplished using a newly available analyzer based on the cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) technique. This analyzer was flown without a drying system or any in-flight <b>calibration</b> <b>gases.</b> Water vapor corrections associated with dilution and pressure- broadening effects for CO 2 and CH 4 were derived from laboratory experiments employing measurements of water vapor by the CRDS analyzer. Before the campaign, {{the stability of the}} analyzer was assessed by laboratory tests under simulated flight conditions. During the campaign, a comparison of CO 2 measurements between the CRDS analyzer and a nondispersive infrared (NDIR) analyzer on board the same aircraft showed a mean difference of 0. 22 +/- 0. 09 ppm for all flights over the Amazon rain forest. At the end of the campaign, CO 2 concentrations of the synthetic <b>calibration</b> <b>gases</b> used by the NDIR analyzer were determined by the CRDS analyzer. After correcting for the isotope and the pressure-broadening effects that resulted from changes of the composition of synthetic vs. ambient air, and applying those concentrations as calibrated values of the <b>calibration</b> <b>gases</b> to reprocess the CO 2 measurements made by the NDIR, the mean difference between the CRDS and the NDIR during BARCA was reduced to 0. 05 +/- 0. 09 ppm, with the mean standard deviation of 0. 23 +/- 0. 05 ppm. The results clearly show that the CRDS is sufficiently stable to be used in flight without drying the air or calibrating in flight and the water corrections are fully adequate for high-accuracy continuous airborne measurements of CO 2 and CH 4...|$|R

50|$|To {{establish}} the odor concentration, an olfactometer test is used, which employs {{a panel of}} human noses as sensors. In the olfactometry testing procedure, a diluted odorous mixture and an odor-free gas (as a reference) are presented separately from sniffing ports {{to a group of}} panelists, who are housed in an odor-neutral room.
