40|$|Chromosomal {{abnormalities}} are {{a frequent}} concomitant of neoplasia, {{and although it}} is tempting to relate these mutations and alterations in chromatin (DNA) function to cancer, their relationship to the initiation or progression of carcinogenesis is unknown. Mammalian cells in culture, after interacting with chemical carcinogens, often exhibit chromosome damage consisting of breaks and exchanges of chromatid material. The pattern of damage of banded metaphases indicates that negative bands are especially vulnerable to the action of chemical carcinogens, probably because of differential chromatin condensation. Damage to individual chromosomes may be random or nonrandom, depending on the species. Cell death can be correlated with chromatid alterations that occur shortly after treatment with chemical carcinogens. There is also a correlation between mutagenic and carcinogenic activity of some chemical carcinogens and the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges. The question of whether specific <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes</b> are absolutely required for neoplastic transformation cannot be answered because of conflicting data and diverse results from studies even with known carcinogens. Cell transformation may occur without any visible <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes.</b> A universal specific numerical or visible structural chromosomal alteration is not necessarily associated with chemical or viral transformation. <b>Chromosome</b> <b>changes</b> are independent of the etiologic agents: different carcinogens may produce transformation associated with the same abnormal chromosomes, but not all transformed lines invariably exhibit the same abnormality, even with the same chemical. In some species, chromosome having nucleolar organizer regions may be more frequently involved in numerical or structural deviations. Progressively growing tumors also may occur {{as a result of the}} proliferation of transformed cells without detectable <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes,</b> indicating that tumorigenicity need not be related to an imbalance of chromosome number or structure. Our studies indicate that <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes</b> are not essential for establishment of neoplasms but that karyotypic instability may result in response to selective growth pressures...|$|R

40|$|There are {{concerns}} about {{the health effects of}} formaldehyde exposure, including carcinogenicity, in light of elevated indoor air levels in new homes and occupational exposures experienced by workers in health care, embalming, manufacturing, and other industries. Epidemiologic studies suggest that formaldehyde exposure is associated with an increased risk of leukemia.

Our objective was to determine if formaldehyde exposure disrupts hematopoietic function and produces leukemia-related <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes</b> in exposed humans. We examined the ability of formaldehyde to disrupt hematopoiesis in a study of 94 workers in China (43 exposed to formaldehyde and 51 frequency-matched controls) by measuring complete blood counts and peripheral stem/progenitor cell colony formation.

40|$|Abstract. â€”Chromosome banding {{techniques}} {{have been used}} in a large-scale survey of karyo-typic variation within and between the chromosomal races of the Gehyra variegata-punctata species group. A total of nine chromosome races are now known among these taxa. G-banding confirms that the principal mode of <b>chromosome</b> <b>change</b> is centric fusion and, in most cases, allowed the specific chromosomes involved to be identified. The location of C-band heterochromatin and the nucleolar organizing region varied within and between the races. In two of the chromosome forms, heteromorphic sex chromosomes were observed {{in the early stages of}} evolution. The cytogenetic characters were evaluated and then used to construct a phylogeny for these taxa. The types of <b>chromosome</b> <b>change</b> between the races and their geographic relationships were then considered to examine the role of chromosomal mechanisms of speciation in these gekkos. The previously suggested role of single centric fusions as initiators of speciation in Gehyra requires further evaluation. In one case, an unusual form of tandem fusion has been established and this race is clearly reproductively isolated from all others. The presence of monobrachial homology between the biarmed chromosomes of some taxa suggests that a distinct mode of chromosomal speciation may also be important in Gehyra.

40|$|It is now common {{knowledge}} that two types of genetic instability, microsatellite instabilty (13 % of cancers) and chromosome instability (87 % of cancers), substantially contribute to the sequential accumulation of genetic alterations leading to cancer. Aneuploidy, a mirror of chromosome instability, characterizes a subgroup of follicular thyroid lesions, often associated with oncocytic features, which show simple trisomy 7 or trisomy 7 accompained by additional polysomies, accumulating according to an evolutionary scheme which parallels the progression from hyperplasia to carcinoma. In order to: a) verify the possibility of recognizing numerical <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes</b> in thyroid cells prior to surgical resection, b) establish the frequency of nodules with numerical chromsome changes prior to surgery selection and c) to confirm the association between aneuploidy and mithocondria accumulation, cells from the thyroid nodules of 108 patients undergoing echo-guided FNAB were investigated, using Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) with centromeric probes specific for chromosomes 7 and 17, and immunofluorescence and FISH (FICTION), using anti-mitochondrion antibody. Numerical <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes</b> for <b>chromosome</b> 7 and/or 17 were found in cells from 8 nodules (4 with oncocytic features), and chromosome 7 and 17 heterozygous centromeric fusion was observed in 1 nodule. All cytological specimens were classified as suspicious.

All cases showed monoclonal CD 5 /CD 19 -positive lymphocytosis, with more than 10 % large lymphocytes and/or prolymphocytes in peripheral blood smears and reactivity with FMC 7, or bright expression of surface immunoglobulins in {{a fraction of the}} cases. Karyotype aberrations were detected in 27 of 43 cases (62. 8 %). Recurrent <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes</b> were + 12 (nine cases), 13 q 14 aberrations (five cases), 11 q anomalies (three cases), 6 q 21 -q 23 abnormalities and 4 q anomalies with different breakpoints (two cases each). Additional <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes</b> were seen in four cases with + 12, in three cases with 13 q 14 anomalies, in two cases with 11 q anomalies, in one case with 6 q and 4 q anomalies. Trisomy 12 was associated with 13 q 14 anomalies in three cases, one of which also had an 11 q abnormality; other associations, found in one case each, were: 13 q 14 deletion with a 6 q anomaly, 11 q anomaly with 13 q- and 7 q-, a 6 q anomaly with 7 q- and + 12. Interphase cytogenetics confirmed the results of chromosome banding analysis and showed that six patients with normal karyotype or no mitosis in fact had concomitant + 12 and 13 q 14 deletion in four cases and isolated + 12 or 13 q 14 deletion in one case each, with a resultant 76 % overall incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities. The presence of + 12, 13 q 14 deletions, 11 q, and 6 q 21 -q 23 anomalies in 19 cases was associated with a 2 -month median interval between diagnosis and start of treatment, as compared with a 24 -month median interval in 14 cases with normal karyotype or non-recurrent <b>chromosome</b> <b>changes</b> (P = 0. 003).

This report details the finding of a recurring translocation site involving the long arm of chromosome 6 (6 q) in malignant melanoma. We have observed a translocation (t) between chromosomes 1 and 6 in five different cases of malignant metastatic melanoma. All five melanomas evidencing t(1; 6) involved band regions 6 q 11 - 13, while two different regions of chromosome 1 (p 22, q 12 -q 21) were shown to be translocated to 6 q. In reviewing previously published cases of melanoma, an additional two cases of t(1; 6) and 13 cases of other translocations to 6 q 11 - 13 have been identified. Chromosome 6 q contains several biologically important gene sequences including the proto-oncogenes ros, myb, and mas 1. However, based on current mapping studies, the breakpoint of this translocation (6 q 11 - 13) is not within the region encoding these sequences.
