50|$|The first {{effort at}} {{controlling}} pollution from automobiles was the PCV (positive <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation)</b> system. This draws crankcase fumes heavy in unburned hydrocarbons — {{a precursor to}} photochemical smog — into the engine's intake tract so they are burned rather than released unburned from the crankcase into the atmosphere. Positive <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> was first installed on a widespread basis by law on all new 1961-model cars first sold in California. The following year, New York required it. By 1964, most new cars sold in the U.S. were so equipped, and PCV quickly became standard equipment on all vehicles worldwide.|$|R
50|$|This vacuum {{can also}} be used to draw any piston blow-by gases from the engine's crankcase. This is known as a {{positive}} <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> system, in which the gases are burned with the fuel/air mixture.|$|R
50|$|Haagen-Smit's {{research}} led {{the automobile}} industry to install positive <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation,</b> the first vehicle emissions control system, in 1961.

50|$|Emission {{reducing}} technology {{began with}} the installation of a positive <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> (PCV) valve (MCA-I), followed {{by the addition of}} a thermo reactor air pump and catalytic converter in addition to a exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve (MCA-II) and a solenoid controlled automatic choke installed on the carburetor.|$|R
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} {{of this system}} is that the exhaust pipe has to be engineered to accommodate the high pressure generated. The retarding horsepower available from this system is significantly lower than other systems. It can cause a marked increase in engine oil carry-over out the <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> system.|$|R
5000|$|During World War II a {{different}} type of <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> had to be invented to allow tank engines to operate during deep fording operations, where the normal draft tube ventilator would have allowed water to enter the crankcase and destroy the engine. [...] The PCV system and its control valve were invented to meet this need, but no need for it on automobiles was recognized.|$|R
50|$|This is {{necessary}} because internal combustion inevitably involves {{a small but}} continual amount of blow-by, which occurs {{when some of the}} gases from the combustion leak past the piston rings (that is, blow by them) to end up inside the crankcase, causing pressure to build up in the crank case. For control of the pressure inside it, a PCV (positive <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation)</b> valve is used to vent the crankcase.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A closed type <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> {{system has}} been adopted to engines to prevent {{emission}} of blow-by gas to atmosphere. In the early closed type <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> system, blow-by gas which contains engine lubricating oil is re-circulated into the intake system. The blow-by gas containing oil mist leads to increased harmful emissions and engine problems. To reduce loss of the engine oil, a highly-efficient oil separation device is required. Principle of a cyclone oil separator is to utilize centrifugal force in the separator and, therefore, oil separator designs depend on rotational flow which causes the centrifugal force. In this paper, flow characteristics and oil separation performances for cyclone type designs are calculated with CFD methodology. In the CFD model, oil particle was injected on a inlet surface with Rosin-Rammler distribution and uniform distribution. The major design parameters considered in the analysis model are inlet area, cone length and outlet depth of the oil separator. As results, reducing inlet area and increasing cone length increase oil separation performance. Changes in outlet depth could avoid interference betwee...|$|R
50|$|Lubricating oil {{creates a}} {{separating}} film between surfaces of adjacent moving parts to minimize direct contact between them, decreasing heat caused by friction and reducing wear, thus protecting the engine. In use, motor oil transfers heat through convection as it {{flows through the}} engine by means of air flow {{over the surface of}} the oil pan, an oil cooler and through the buildup of oil gases evacuated by the Positive <b>Crankcase</b> <b>Ventilation</b> (PCV) system.|$|R
50|$|Manifold vacuum is {{an effect}} of a piston's {{movement}} on the induction stroke and the choked flow through a throttle in the intake manifold of an engine. It {{is a measure of}} the amount of restriction of airflow through the engine, and hence of the unused power capacity in the engine. In some engines, the manifold vacuum is also used as an auxiliary power source to drive engine accessories and for the <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> system.|$|R
50|$|Sludge {{is usually}} {{caused by a}} poorly {{designed}} or defective <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> system, low engine operating temperatures, the presence {{of water in the}} oil or crankshaft-induced cavitation, and can accumulate with use. Oil sludge that causes an engine to run poorly or even seize is a rare occurrence and typically happens only when oil changes have been neglected or if the car has been driven extensively with an extremely low oil level.|$|R

By 1964, most new cars {{sold in the}} U.S. were so equipped by voluntary industry action {{so as not to}} have to make multiple state-specific versions of vehicles. PCV quickly became standard equipment on all vehicles worldwide because of its benefits not only in emissions reduction but also in engine internal cleanliness and oil lifespan.|$|R

2500|$|Mechanical {{revisions}} for 1961 included new carburetors, {{the availability}} of positive <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> (which was newly mandated on cars sold in California), {{the availability of}} dealer-installed air conditioning, the relocation of the alternator from the left {{to the right side}} of the engine, and extensive revisions throughout most of the Valiant's systems and components. Late in the 1961 model year, the larger [...] Slant-6 engine became available in the Valiant, its use having been expanded earlier in the year from the larger Dodges and Plymouths to the Valiant-sized Dodge Lancer.|$|R
50|$|Emissions output was {{controlled}} by several systems. The EGR, or Exhaust Gas Recirculation system, brought exhaust gas from the exhaust stream up to the intake manifold, lowering peak combustion temperatures, the goal being the reduction of NOX emissions. A PCV, or Positive <b>Crankcase</b> <b>Ventilation</b> system, introduced oil vapor and unburnt fuel vapors from the crankcase to the intake, allowing the engine to re-use these as well. Furthermore, gasoline vapors that would normally be released into the atmosphere were captured by the EVAP system, to then be introduced into the engine.|$|R
50|$|All {{injection}} pumps incorporate a governor to cut fuel supply if the crankshaft rpm endangers the engine - the heavy moving parts of diesel engines do not tolerate overspeeding well, and catastrophic damage can occur {{if they are}} over-revved. Poorly maintained and worn engines can consume their lubrication oil through worn out <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems and 'run away', causing increasing engine speed until the engine destroys itself. This is because most diesel engines only regulate their speed by fuel supply control and don't have a throttle valve to control air intake.|$|R
50|$|If {{an engine}} is damaged or enters old age, gaps can form between the {{cylinder}} walls and pistons, resulting in larger amounts of blow-by than the <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> system can handle. The gaps cause power loss, and ultimately {{mean that the}} engine needs to be rebuilt or replaced. Symptoms of excessive blow-by include oil being pushed {{up into the air}} filter, out the dipstick, or out the PCV valve. In rare cases of serious piston or ring damage, the oil filter housing's sheet metal can even burst at its seam.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the oil cooler seals; this engine can also have an issue with {{the design of the}} positive <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> system. The <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> system vents to the inlet of the turbo. The issue is that the air vented from the crankcase contains too much oil to easily pass through the swirl motor valves downstream of the turbo. Once this oil and sludge begin to accumulate, the valve becomes inoperative and blows a fuse that controls many other sensors required to properly operate the engine and emission system. This will immediately place the vehicle into limp home mode and limit the rpm to 3000. It also causes a check engine light and numerous OBDII Codes. Mercedes Benz has previously recognized this feature of the vehicle and has stated that this engine feature, the accumulation of oil at the turbo inlet, is [...] "normal". In a Technical Service Bulletin they issued in 2008 they state:"Engine oil venting occurs on the right hand side of the engine air intake duct. For this reason there is always some oil in the engine air intake duct, see (Figure 3). This is no justification for replacing the turbocharger. Turbochargers replaced for this reason will not be covered by warranty." [...] While a slight amount of oil may be normal and acceptable, sufficient quantities and accumulation will indeed lead to other failures as identified above.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{affected}} by an oil sludge problem and premature timing chain tensioner failure, which were fixed around 2002-2004. The oil sludge issue {{appears to have been}} caused by issues with the <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> system, and while it affected a minority of engines, it could cause complete failure In some cases, neglected maintenance aided in premature failure (missed oil changes or increased intervals between oil changes). Also this engine was plagued with issues regarding the water pump gasket leaking coolant internally and diluting the oil. Such coolant leaks must be addressed instantly or engine failure is imminent.|$|R

50|$|The road draft tube, though simple, has shortcomings: it {{does not}} {{function}} when the vehicle is moving too slowly to create a draft, so postal and other slow-moving delivery vehicles tended to suffer rapid buildup of engine sludge due to poor <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation.</b> And non-road vehicles such as boats never generated a draft on the tube, no matter how fast they were going. The draft tube discharged the crankcase gases, composed largely of unburnt hydrocarbons, directly into the air. This created pollution as well as objectionable odors. Moreover, the draft tube could become clogged with snow or ice, in which case crankcase pressure would build and cause oil leaks and gasket failure.|$|R
50|$|The B205 & B235-based 9-5 {{models have}} {{suffered}} {{a high rate of}} engine failures due to engine oil sludge. This primarily affected the 1999-2003 models. Saab refined the engine's positive <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> system (PCV) for the 2004 and later model years and required use of fully synthetic oil, virtually eliminating the problem. Additionally, SAAB created update kits to retrofit to the 1999-2003 cars since they cannot be easily modified to accept the 2004 and later system. Mounting complaints by 9-5 owners forced GM to offer an eight-year warranty on the engine in 4-cylinder models for original owners, provided the owner can produce proof that they followed the manufacturer's oil change intervals. Saab recommends the use of Full Synthetic or Synthetic blend oil as a preventative measure.|$|R

50|$|Although direct {{injection}} provides {{more power and}} efficiency, a carbon build-up occurs in the intake valves that over time reduces the airflow to the cylinders, and therefore reduces power. Fuel contains various detergents and can keep the intakes clean. When fuel is no longer being sprayed in the intake valves, small amounts of dirt from intake air and blowback carbon from the <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> system cakes on the intake walls, even with air filters that prevent most of the dirt from entering the cylinder. This build-up can become severe enough that a piece can break off and {{has been known to}} burn holes in catalytic converters. It can also cause sporadic ignition failures. These problems have been known for some time and technologies have been improved to reduce the carbon build-up.|$|R
50|$|The first {{refinement}} in <b>crankcase</b> <b>ventilation</b> was {{the road}} draft tube, {{which is a}} pipe running from a high location contiguous to the crankcase (such as {{the side of the}} engine block, or the valve cover on an overhead valve engine) down to an open end facing down and located in the vehicle's slipstream. When the vehicle is moving, airflow across the open end of the tube creates a draft that pulls gases out of the crankcase. The high location of the engine end of the pipe minimises liquid oil loss. An air inlet path to the crankcase, called the breather and often incorporated into the oil filler cap, meant that when a draft was generated at the tube, fresh air swept through the crankcase to clear out the blow-by gases.|$|R
