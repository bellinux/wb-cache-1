25|$|Baikal's age is {{estimated}} at 25 million years, making it the most ancient lake in geological history. It is unique among large, high-latitude lakes, as its sediments have not been scoured by overriding continental ice sheets. Russian, U.S., and Japanese cooperative studies of deep-drilling core sediments in the 1990s provide a detailed record of <b>climatic</b> <b>variation</b> over the past 6.7 million years. Longer and deeper sediment cores are expected in the near future. Lake Baikal is the only confined freshwater lake in which direct and indirect evidence of gas hydrates exists.|$|E
25|$|However, {{organisms and}} ecosystems, {{as far as}} it can be {{determined}} by the fossil record, do not appear to have undergone the significant change that would be expected by a mass extinction. With the advent of more precise dating, a phytoplankton extinction event which had been associated with snowball Earth was shown to precede glaciations by 16million years. Even if life were to cling on in all the ecological refuges listed above, a whole-Earth glaciation would result in a biota with a noticeably different diversity and composition. This change in diversity and composition has not yet been observed– in fact, the organisms which should be most susceptible to <b>climatic</b> <b>variation</b> emerge unscathed from the snowball Earth.|$|E
25|$|Geographic and {{environmental}} causes can {{also play a}} significant role in contributing to Burkina Faso's issue of food insecurity. As the country is situated in the Sahel region, Burkina Faso experiences some of the most radical <b>climatic</b> <b>variation</b> in the world, ranging from severe flooding to extreme drought. The unpredictable climatic shock that Burkina Faso citizens often face results in strong difficulties in being able to rely on and accumulate wealth through agricultural means. Burkina Faso's climate also renders its crops vulnerable to insect attacks, including attacks from locusts and crickets, which destroy crops and further inhibit food production. Not only is most of the population of Burkina Faso dependent on agriculture as a source of income, but they also rely on the agricultural sector for food that will directly feed the household. Due to the vulnerability of agriculture, more and more families are having to look for other sources of non-farm income, and oftentimes have to travel outside of their regional zone to find work.|$|E

2500|$|Investigating {{the impacts}} of {{anthropogenic}} activities and climate change in the deep sea is a theme that runs through all HERMIONE research. [...] To the biological communities on open slopes and in deep basins, seafloor warming through climate change is a major threat. [...] Up to 85% of methane reservoirs along the continental margin could be destabilised, which would not only release climate-warming methane gas into the atmosphere, but would also have unknown and potentially devastating consequences on benthic communities. [...] The role of <b>climatic</b> <b>variation</b> on deep-sea benthos is not well understood, although large-scale changes {{in the structure of}} seafloor communities have been observed over the last two decades. [...] The use of long-term, deep-sea observatories, e.g., the Hausgarten deep-sea observatory in the Arctic and the time-series analysis of the Catalan margin and Southern Adriatic Sea, will help HERMIONE scientists to examine recent changes in benthic communities, and to study decadal variability in physical processes, such as the dense shelf water cascading events in submarine canyons.|$|E

Atlantic SST fields with multi-decadal lags express characteristic high correlation to the tropical Pacific. The Atlantic <b>climatic</b> <b>variations</b> are suggested {{to come back}} to the Pacific. Central America, where the two oceans locate nearby each other like as an isthmus, has been proposed as one of the probable candidates connecting with the processes. The Pacific off Central America is affected by atmospheric forcing, such as wind stresses, from the Atlantic side. The variation of atmospheric conditions might considerably reflect that of oceanic conditions. The decadal time scale analysis gives indications of the processes to be influenced by Atmospheric Hand of Atlantic (AHA), the atmospheric forcing of which variation relates to the Atlantic <b>climatic</b> <b>variations.</b> Central America plays a conjunctive role, not only in geomorphology but also as a link for decadal variability between the Pacific and the Atlantic...|$|R
