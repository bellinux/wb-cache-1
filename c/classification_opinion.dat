The general purpose subjectivity lexicons are useful for the reviews which are not associated with the specific domain. The studies conducted in the recent past have focused on the generation of general purpose lexicons by utilizing the existing web resources, such as online documents, dataset of user feedbacks and different lexicons. In such lexicons range of semantic scores associated with each word is between − 1 and + 1.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- As {{individuals}} impart on the Web their sentiments {{on products}} and services they have used, it has become important to formulate methods of automatically classifying and judging them. The task of examining such data, collectively called client feedback data, is known as opinion mining. Opinion mining consists of several steps, and different techniques have been proposed for different steps. This paper basically explains such techniques {{that have been used}} for the implementation of task of opinion mining. On the basis of this analysis we provide an overall system design for the development of opinion mining approach.

40|$|Recent {{systems have}} been {{developed}} for sentiment <b>classification,</b> <b>opinion</b> recognition, and opinion analysis (e. g., detecting polarity and strength). We pursue another aspect of opinion analysis: identifying the sources of opinions, emotions, and sentiments. We view this problem as an information extraction task and adopt a hybrid approach that combines Conditional Random Fields (Lafferty et al., 2001) and a variation of AutoSlog (Riloff, 1996 a). While CRFs model source identification as a sequence tagging task, AutoSlog learns extraction patterns. Our results show that the combination of these two methods performs better than either one alone. The resulting system identifies opinion sources with 79. 3 % precision and 59. 5 % recall using a head noun matching measure, and 81. 2 % precision and 60. 6 % recall using an overlap measure. ...|$|E

40|$|Domain {{transfer}} {{is a widely}} recognized problem for machine learning algorithms because models built upon one data domain generally do not perform well in another data domain. This is especially a challenge for tasks such as <b>opinion</b> <b>classification,</b> which often {{has to deal with}} insufficient quantities of labeled data. This study investigates the feasibility of self-training in dealing with the domain transfer problem in <b>opinion</b> <b>classification</b> via leveraging labeled data in non-target data domain(s) and unlabeled data in the target-domain. Specifically, self-training is evaluated for effectiveness in sparse data situations and feasibility for domain adaptation in <b>opinion</b> <b>classification.</b> Three types of Web content are tested: edited news articles, semi-structured movie reviews, and the informal and unstructured content of the blogosphere. Findings of this study suggest that, when there are limited labeled data, self-training is a promising approach for <b>opinion</b> <b>classification,</b> although the contributions vary across data domains. Significant improvement was demonstrated for the most challenging data domain-the blogosphere-when a domain transfer-based self-training strategy was implemented...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} tasks in medical image analysis is to detect the absence or presence of disease in an image, without having precise delineations of pathology available for training. A novel method is proposed to solve such a classification task, based on a generalized representation of an image derived from local per-pixel features. From this representation, differences between images can be computed, and these can be used to classify the image requiring knowledge of only global image labels for training. It is shown how to construct multiple representations of one image to get multiple <b>classification</b> <b>opinions</b> and combine them to smooth over errors of individual classifiers. The performance of the method is evaluated on the detection of interstitial lung disease on standard chest radiographs. The best result is obtained for the combining classification scheme yielding an area under the ROC curve of 0. 955. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The 1997 and 2009 WHO dengue case classifications were {{compared}} {{in a systematic}} review with 12 eligible studies (4 prospective). Ten expert opinion articles were used for discussion. For the 2009 WHO classification studies show: when determining severe dengue sensitivity ranges between 59 – 98 % (88 %/ 98 %: prospective studies), specificity between 41 – 99 % (99 %: prospective study) - comparing the 1997 WHO classification: sensitivity 24. 8 – 89. 9 % (24. 8 %/ 74 %: prospective studies), specificity: 25 %/ 100 % (100 %: prospective study). The application of the 2009 WHO classifi-cation is easy, however for (non-severe) dengue {{there may be a}} risk of monitoring increased case numbers. Warning signs validation studies are needed. For epidemiological/pathogenesis research use of the 2009 WHO <b>classification,</b> <b>opinion</b> papers show that ease of application, increased sensitivity (severe dengue) and international comparability are advanta-geous; 3 severe dengue criteria (severe plasma leakage, severe bleeding, severe organ manifestation) are useful research endpoints.

40|$|Web Information Discovery Integrated Tool (WIDIT) Laboratory at the Indiana University School of Library and Information Science {{participated in}} the Blog track’s opinion task in TREC- 2006. The goal of opinion task is to "uncover the public {{sentiment}} towards a given entity/target", which involves not only retrieving topically relevant blogs but also identifying those that contain opinions about the target. To further complicate the matter, the blog test collection contains considerable amount of noise, such as blogs with non-English content and non-blog content (e. g., advertisement, navigational text), which may misdirect retrieval systems. Based on our hypothesis that noise reduction (e. g., exclusion of non-English blogs, navigational text) will improve both on-topic and opinion retrieval performances, we explored various noise reduction approaches that can effectively eliminate the noise in blog data without inadvertently excluding valid content. After creating two separate indexes (with and without noise) to assess the noise reduction effect, we tackled the opinion blog retrieval task by breaking it down to two sequential subtasks: on-topic retrieval followed by <b>opinion</b> <b>classification.</b> Our <b>opinion</b> retrieval approach was to first apply traditional IR methods to retrieve on-topic blogs, and then boost the ranks of opinionated blogs based on opinion scores generated by opinion assessment methods.

A number of opinion mining methods have been proposed in the past to identify and classify an opinion into positive or negative.
