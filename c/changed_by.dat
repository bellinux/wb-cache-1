5|$|To {{solve the}} {{remaining}} problems, Viète exploited {{the fact that}} the given circles and the solution circle may be re-sized in tandem while preserving their tangencies (Figure4). If the solution-circle radius is <b>changed</b> <b>by</b> an amount Δr, the radius of its internally tangent given circles must be likewise <b>changed</b> <b>by</b> Δr, whereas the radius of its externally tangent given circles must be <b>changed</b> <b>by</b> −Δr. Thus, as the solution circle swells, the internally tangent given circles must swell in tandem, whereas the externally tangent given circles must shrink, to maintain their tangencies.|$|E

40|$|This article {{offers a}} {{conceptual}} framework to understand radical change. It opens with a typology that defines change {{in terms of its}} pace and scope, and defines radical change as the swift transformation of an entire system. How radical change in public policy has occurred in the past is then documented. We find examples of radical <b>change</b> <b>by</b> chance, radical <b>change</b> <b>by</b> consensus, radical <b>change</b> <b>by</b> learning, and radical <b>change</b> <b>by</b> entrepreneurial design. Radical <b>change</b> <b>by</b> entrepreneurial design then becomes the focal point, in order to acquaint the reader with the strategies and tactics of well-known entrepreneurs who have been successful in molding and shaping the radical change process. The implications of this conceptual framework to acquisition reform conclude the paper, along with some suggestions for follow-on action. Explaining change and how it occurs has been a central theme in management and related disciplines. In a recent literature search using change an...|$|R

5|$|By the Late Middle Ages (approx 1300-1550), large battles {{became more}} common, {{probably}} because {{of the success of}} infantry tactics and changes in weaponry.

5|$|In the remakes, after {{selecting}} a character, the player {{can change the}} character's starting abilities with five magical seeds, given at the tavern.

Most personalities are available to both male and female characters, while a few are exclusive to male or female characters.

In 1936, the TSFSR was dissolved under Stalin's orders and the socialist republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia were established instead. For the Armenian people, conditions grew worse under Stalin's rule. In a period of twenty-five years, Armenia was industrialized and educated under strictly prescribed conditions, and nationalism was harshly suppressed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} making the Zephyr lighter than {{conventional}} trains was that the individual carbodies in the train share their trucks with adjacent cars. In this design by Budd engineer Walter B. Dean, the train was three articulated compartments. On conventional passenger cars, each carbody rode upon a pair of trucks (pivot-mounted wheel-axle assembly), with one truck at each end. The articulation not only {{reduced the number of}} trucks under the train, but it also dispensed with the need for couplers between each of the carbodies, further reducing the train's weight. It did, however, mean that train lengths could not be easily <b>changed</b> <b>by</b> switching out cars.|$|E
