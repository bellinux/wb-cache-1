40|$|Ion {{movement}} in porous media is of broad interest in engineering, science and agriculture. In agriculture, <b>crystalline</b> <b>fertilizer</b> may {{be applied to}} the surface of a soil or other media and physically shielded from surface applied water to minimize leaching and conserve fertilizers. This dissertation explored the basic underlying physical processes of this practice whereby coupled ion-water movement results from the addition of salts to the surface of a hydrostatic unsaturated porous medium. Experiments were conducted where KBr and NaBr salts were placed at the surface of sealed columns filled with a peat:vermicultite (1 : 1 by volume) container medium at initial water contents of 4. 0, 2. 5 or 1 a. Bromide and water distributions were determined in replicated columns 1. 0 gH 20 /g after 5, 10, 25 and 120 days. Diffusion rates increased with increasing water content. Differences in the hygroscopicity and solubility of KBr and NaBr affected the distribution of water and diffusion rates. Redistribution of water was most apparent at low water content. At high water content, water redistribution was affected by solution density gradients. Using an analytical solution to the Fickian diffusion model gave usefu...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{mathematical}} models in financial and economic {{analysis of the}} impact of factors on agricultural productivity growth is a priority in the contemporary developments of the agricultural sector. The main {{purpose of this study is}} the selection of the best structure for the use of production factors in the cultivation of four different varieties of tomato (Merit, Fine, Samos and Laura) in the greenhouses using a multivariate mathematical model. Hence, our research is focused in identifying and analyzing the most important factors affecting the level of greenhouse tomato culture productivity in 16 municipalities of Lushnja district. Based on the level of importance, the correlation analysis listed those factors: manure (0. 369), fertilizer (0. 149), water (0. 189), and liquid <b>crystalline</b> <b>fertilizer</b> (0. 096). Moreover, focusing on the actual levels of production factors used by each municipality, we estimated the maximum yield (113 q/are), and the most likely production that could be achieved (100 q/are), based on a rational use of factors. On the basis of the obtained results, the maximum unused reserves were calculated for each municipality in the district of Lushnja. The obtained results constitute a strong basis for budgeting and forecasting activities not only for the tomato crop but also for other agricultural cultures cultivated in other municipalities in the district of Lushnja and in Albania...|$|E
