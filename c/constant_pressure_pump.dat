For the purpose of saving energy, the <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>pumps</b> {{have in the past}} frequently been replaced by load-sensing pumps and load-sensing valves. However, considering applications where the load is helped by the gravitational force, even these hydraulic systems often suffer from poor efficiency. In this article, a novel pump-controlled hydraulic system is studied where energy recuperation from lowering motions is posssible. The pumps are fully displaceable in both directions, working as motors when lowering loads. The amount of recuperated energy is highly dependent of the chosen control strategy, the hydromechanical properties as well as the target application. Furthermore, the article describes how valve design becomes an important feature in an attempt to reach high efficiency and machine operability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A new {{scheme to}} obtain optimal fuzzy subsets and rules is proposed. The method {{is derived from}} the use of genetic algorithms, where the genes of the {{chromosome}} are classified into two different types. These genes can be arranged in a hierarchical form, where one type of genes controls the other type of genes. The effectiveness of this genetic formulation enables the fuzzy subsets and rules to be optimally reduced and, yet, the system performance is well maintained. In this paper, the details of formulation of the genetic structure are given. The required procedures for coding the fuzzy membership function and rules into the chromosome are also described. To justify this approach to fuzzy logic design, the proposed scheme is applied to control a <b>constant</b> water <b>pressure</b> <b>pumping</b> system. The obtained results, as well as the associated final fuzzy subsets, are included in this paper. Because of its simplicity, the method could lead to a potentially low-cost fuzzy logic implementation.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a bond graph {{dynamic model}} for a valvecontrolled {{hydraulic}} cylinder has been developed. A simplified bond graph model of the inter-actuator interactions in a multi-cylinder hydraulic system has also been presented. The overall bond graph model of a valve-controlled hydraulic cylinder was developed by combining the bond graph sub-models of the pump, spool valve and the actuator using junction structures. Causality was then assigned {{in order to obtain}} a computational model which could be simulated. The causal bond graph model of the hydraulic cylinder was verified by comparing the open loop state responses to those of an ODE model which had been developed in literature based on the same assumptions. The results were found to correlate very well both {{in the shape of the}} curves, magnitude and the response times, thus indicating that the developed model represents the hydraulic dynamics of a valve-controlled cylinder. A simplified model for interactuator interaction was presented by connecting an effort source with <b>constant</b> <b>pump</b> <b>pressure</b> to the zero-junction from which the cylinders in a multi-cylinder system are supplied with a <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> from the <b>pump.</b> On simulating the state responses of the developed model under different situations of cylinder operations, indicated that such a simple model can be used to predict the inter-actuator interactions.

For the purpose of saving energy the <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>pumps</b> have, in the past, often been replaced by load-sensing pumps and load-sensing valves. In mobile applications these load-sensing solutions have significantly reduced the energy consumption. However, in applications with unequal drive pressure levels the load sensing systems still result in energy losses, referred to as metering losses. Throttling losses associated to load lowering have also been {{paid more attention to}} in the energy debates. By instead adopting direct pump displacement control, with the capability of energy recuperation in lowering motions, many of these losses can be avoided. In this article the author has studied a hydraulic system configuration where each actuator/supply system comprises an electrically controlled variable displacement pump/motor working in an open-circuit together with four separate electrically controlled valves. The four valves render a solution versatile in control, as the cylinder chambers can be connected to pump and/or tank as well as be closed at any time. Depending on how the valves are controlled different modes of operation are achieved, which in turn yields different total energy efficiency depending on the present working point. In this study the performance, operability and energy consumption is evaluated in a wheel loader that is first looked upon with its original load sensing hydraulic system and then modified with a completely new pump controlled hydraulic system. Measurements published in this article demonstrate the advantages and drawbacks of pump control in an open circuit compared to a load sensing system. Performance is evaluated by looking at productivity, loading capacity and duty cycle time of a typical loading cycle. Operability is evaluated by looking at response times, load oscillations and driver comfort. Theoretical calculations of energy efficiency including metering and throttling losses over the valves as well as pump efficiency, line losses and losses in the recuperation phase are evaluated and validated. The fuel consumption of the pump-controlled wheel loader is measured and put side by side to measurements of the same machine equipped with a load-sensing hydraulic system...|$|R
30|$|Over the years, {{technology}} has developed. Drag-reducing additives are classified into three categories: polymers, fibers and surfactants. The key role of these additives is {{to suppress the}} growth of turbulent eddies through the absorption of the energy released by {{the breakdown of the}} lamellar layer (Martinez-Palou et al. 2011). Furthermore, drag additive helps reduce friction near the pipeline walls and within the turbulent fluid core during transportation, which results in high flow rate at a <b>constant</b> <b>pumping</b> <b>pressure.</b> However, details of the different categories of drag-reducing additives {{can be found in a}} review by Martinez-Palou et al. 2011. Consequently, solubility of the drag-reducing additives in the heavy crude oil is a key requirement.

The four valves render a solution versatile in control, as the cylinder chambers can be connected to pump and/or tank as well as be closed at any time. The pump is electrically controlled and is used either in pressure control mode or flow control mode depending on the state of operation. Along with the hardware described above, the open-circuit solution requires a number of electronic sensors as well as a microprocessor control system, hence the system is a mechatronic system. In contrast to a conventional hydraulic system the control objectives in this concept are not strictly defined by the hardware configuration, but instead many of its critical parameters can be adjusted in software, thus an increased flexibility in system design is obtained. Consequently, defining the desired system properties becomes even more important. Furthermore system robustness must be considered to a greater extent, due to the increased number of sensors and components. The main focus in this paper is to show how machine operability and performance depends on a set of chosen control strategies, what can be achieved as to energy efficiency and driver comfort and at what cost. Additionally the trade-off between energy efficiency and comfort is discussed. In previous work the author has investigated the influence on energy efficiency by lowering loads in different modes of operation, in respect to how the valves are controlled. In this article strategies to decide which mode of operation is the most energy efficient are considered, and how transitions between these modes can be handled by pressure matching prior to opening valves. As the open circuit solution does not support energy storage over time, methods to manage recuperated excess energy is investigated in order to prevent the primary mover from speeding up. The author will also discuss some application specific challenges where a wheel loader has been equipped with the open-circuit solution. For instance, how to handle interference between drives due to the mechanical coupling in the lifting framework and how to handle load actuation over gravity center...|$|R

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Countercurrent chromatography (CCC) is an advanced liquid-liquid extraction technique that purifies chemical components from complex mixtures. The Brunel CCC' is a J-type centrifuge based upon this technique. This machine can process 5 g quantities of sample every 5 hours [Sutherland 1998]. To process 1 tonne of sample per year would require 200 Brunel CCCs, which is not practical as an industrial process. A practical alternative is to use one machine with 200 times the processing capability. To construct such a machine requires {{a greater understanding of}} the stationary phase retention inside a coil (column) and the column efficiency (mass transfer between the mobile and stationary phases). This thesis contains research into stationary phase retention. A hypothesis that all J-type centrifuges act as <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> drop <b>pumps</b> is proposed. This hypothesis combined with the Hagan-Poiseuille equation for laminar flow produces a theoretical basis for plotting the stationary phase retention against the square root of the mobile phase flow rate as proposed by Du et al [1999]. Supporting experimental evidence is presented showing that the mobile phase flows in a laminar manner and that the pressure drop across a coil is constant for a given set of operating conditions. It is shown that the pressure drop is the same in both normal and reverse phase modes if specific conditions are met. The pressure drop is shown to be independent of tubing bore for helical coils provided that the same helical pitch is used. The experimental results also show how the pressure drop varies with the phase system and rotational speed. Hopefully this is a significant advance in predicting the stationary phase retention of industrial scale J-type centrifuges...|$|R

The {{effects of}} {{coronary}} capacitance on instantaneous pressure-flow (P/F) relationships {{were analyzed using}} a theoretical model of coronary flow during diastole that included capacitance.

The effects of coronary capacitance are eliminated using <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions. The instantaneous (dynamic) and <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> (static) P/F relationships were compared experimentally using a reservoir to provide <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> perfusion during prolonged diastoles in heart blocked dogs.
