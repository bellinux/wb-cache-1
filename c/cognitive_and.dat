5|$|Symptoms of Huntington's disease most {{commonly}} become noticeable {{between the ages}} of 35 and 44years, but they can begin at any age from infancy to old age. In the early stages, there are subtle changes in personality, cognition, and physical skills. The physical symptoms are usually the first to be noticed, as <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> behavioral symptoms are generally not severe enough to be recognized on their own at the earlier stages. Almost everyone with Huntington's disease eventually exhibits similar physical symptoms, but the onset, progression and extent of <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> behavioral symptoms vary significantly between individuals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background: In present research, the {{structural}} equation modeling {{of the relationship between}} <b>cognitive</b> avoidance <b>and</b> rumination with clinical symptoms of OCD with mediating role of cognitive failure was studied. Materials and Methods: In a descriptive correlational study, 220 patients with OCD were selected from Urmia psychological clinics and completed YBOCS, RRS, CAQ, and CFQ questionnaires. For data analysis, {{structural equation modeling}} (SEM) was used. Results: The results showed that the modified final model is best fitted with present research data <b>and</b> <b>cognitive</b> avoidance, rumination, <b>and</b> <b>cognitive</b> failure paths with OCD <b>and</b> <b>cognitive</b> avoidance, <b>and</b> rumination paths with cognitive failure were significant. Also, indirect paths such as <b>cognitive</b> avoidance <b>and</b> rumination to OCD were significant. Conclusion: According to the results of this study, it can be concluded that in addition to the direct relationship, cognitive failure can adjust the relationship between <b>cognitive</b> avoidance <b>and</b> rumination with OCD. ...|$|R

5|$|Concussion, {{also known}} as minor head trauma or mild {{traumatic}} brain injury (mTBI) {{is the most common}} type of traumatic brain injury. It is typically defined as a head injury with a temporary loss of brain function. Symptoms include a variety of physical, <b>cognitive,</b> <b>and</b> emotional symptoms, which may not be recognized if subtle. A variety of signs accompany concussion including headache, feeling in a fog, and emotional changeability. In general, the signs can be categorized into physical signs (such as loss of consciousness or amnesia), behavioral changes (such as irritability), cognitive impairment (such as slowed reaction times), and sleep disturbances. Fewer than 10% of sports-related concussions among children are associated with loss of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{abstract}} thinking {{can be seen}} in the archaeological record as early as the Acheulean-Middle Stone Age transition, approximately 300,000-250,000 years ago. This transition involves a shift in stone tool technology from Mode 2, Acheulean tools, to Mode 3 and 4, which include blades and microliths. The manufacture of these tools requires planning and the understanding of how striking a stone will produce different flaking patterns. This requires abstract thought, one of the hallmarks of modern human behavior. The shift from large cutting tools in the Acheulian to smaller and more diversified toolkits in the MSA represents a better <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> conceptual understanding of flintknapping, as well as the potential functional effects of distinct tool types.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{acetylcysteine}} {{has been}} confirmed, {{in a recent}} double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted by the US military, to reduce the effects of blast induced mild traumatic brain and neurological injury in soldiers. Multiple animal studies have also demonstrated its efficacy in reducing the damage associated with moderate traumatic brain or spinal injury, and also ischemia-induced brain injury. In particular, it has been demonstrated through multiple studies to significantly reduce neuronal losses and to improve <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> neurological outcomes associated with these traumatic events. Acetylcysteine has been safely used to treat paracetamol overdose for over forty years and is extensively used in emergency medicine.|$|E

40|$|Existing {{research}} {{suggests that there is}} a relation between academic <b>and</b> <b>cognitive</b> ability <b>and</b> externalizing behavior in young children, but the direction of this relation is unclear. The present study tested competing models of the relation between academic <b>and</b> <b>cognitive</b> functioning <b>and</b> behavior problems during early childhood. Participants were 223 children (120 boys, 103 girls) who participated in a longitudinal study from age 3 to 6. A reciprocal model was supported in which early academic <b>and</b> <b>cognitive</b> problems <b>and</b> externalizing behavior predict one another over time, controlling for mothers 2 ̆ 7 education and family stress. When hyperactivity, inattention, and aggression were examined separately with controls, there was evidence that the reciprocal relation was driven primarily by inattention and hyperactivity. No significant gender differences were found. These results suggest that the reciprocal relation between academic <b>and</b> <b>cognitive</b> ability <b>and</b> inattention/hyperactivity is evident early in development, highlighting the need for early assessment and intervention. ...|$|R

5|$|In contrast, during wake periods {{differentiated}} effector cells, such as cytotoxic natural killer {{cells and}} CTLs (cytotoxic T lymphocytes), peak in order to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens. As well during awake active times, anti-inflammatory molecules, such as cortisol and catecholamines, peak. There are two theories {{as to why the}} pro-inflammatory state is reserved for sleep time. First, inflammation would cause serious <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> physical impairments if it were to occur during wake times. Second, inflammation may occur during sleep times due to the presence of melatonin. Inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time.|$|E
5|$|Outcome {{is related}} to the extent and {{duration}} of lead exposure. Effects of lead on the physiology of the kidneys and blood are generally reversible; its effects on the central nervous system are not. While peripheral effects in adults often go away when lead exposure ceases, evidence suggests that most of lead's effects on a child's central nervous system are irreversible. Children with lead poisoning may thus have adverse health, <b>cognitive,</b> <b>and</b> behavioral effects that follow them into adulthood.|$|E
5|$|Reported neuropsychiatric manifestations are anxiety, depression, {{a reduced}} display of {{emotions}} (blunted affect), egocentrism, aggression, and compulsive behavior, {{the latter of}} which can cause or worsen addictions, including alcoholism, gambling, and hypersexuality. Difficulties in recognizing other people's negative expressions have also been observed. The prevalence of these symptoms is highly variable between studies, with estimated rates for lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders between 33% and 76%. For many sufferers and their families, these symptoms {{are among the most}} distressing aspects of the disease, often affecting daily functioning and constituting reason for institutionalization. Suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts are more common than in the general population. Often individuals have reduced awareness of chorea, <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> emotional impairments.|$|E

5|$|The afternoon, {{especially}} the early afternoon, {{is associated with}} a dip in a variety of areas of human <b>cognitive</b> <b>and</b> productive functioning. Notably, motor vehicle accidents occur more frequently in the early afternoon, when drivers presumably have recently finished lunch. A study of motor accidents in Sweden between 1987 and 1991 found that the time around 5 pm had by far the most accidents: around 1,600 at 5 pm compared to around 1,000 each at 4 pm and 6 pm. This trend may have been influenced by the afternoon rush hour, but the morning rush hour showed a much smaller increase. In Finland, accidents in the agriculture industry are most common in the afternoon, specifically Monday afternoons in September.|$|E
5|$|This view of {{language}} {{is associated with}} the study {{of language}} in pragmatic, <b>cognitive,</b> <b>and</b> interactive frameworks, as well as in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena, as structures that are always in the process of changing as they are employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of linguistic typology, or the classification of languages according to structural features, as it can be shown that processes of grammaticalization tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on typology. In the philosophy of language, the view of pragmatics as being central to language and meaning is often associated with Wittgenstein's later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as J. L. Austin, Paul Grice, John Searle, and W. O. Quine.|$|E
