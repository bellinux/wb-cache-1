50|$|The {{open access}} library and {{documentation}} centre was opened in 1990, the collection focusing on contemporary France and Franco-German relations. The library currently holds around 37,000 volumes. In addition, {{there is a}} press <b>cuttings</b> <b>archive</b> containing over half a million articles, covering the period from 1975 to the present. The press archive has been online since summer 2009, although older material {{has not yet been}} retro-digitalised.|$|E
50|$|For {{his work}} on the Germans in Rome in the 18th century, he devised a {{comprehensive}} archive of notes. On 18,000 slips of paper, it contains over 11,000 entries on artists active in Rome and their clients, usually in Gabelsberger shorthand, but also in newspaper <b>cuttings</b> and <b>archive</b> statements. Today the material is stored in the archive of the Bibliotheca Hertziana in Rome and is accessible online.|$|R
5000|$|The library {{contains}} work by non-UK {{poets and}} publishers and press <b>cuttings</b> are also <b>archived</b> for members' research. Membership {{is free and}} material is borrowed through the national inter-lending library services or returned by post. [...] The library provides support for schools nationally and locally. The venue has an exhibition and event space.|$|R
40|$|This {{examination}} {{paper is}} the {{account for the}} author’s work while arranging and registrating the business archives and business records of the Herman Bergman’s Foundry in Stockholm, Sweden. It {{is part of the}} one year Masters program in Archival Science at the University of Uppsala. The records are {{from the beginning of the}} 1900 s to the 1970 s. Most of the business archives are from he 1940 s to the 1950 s. They contain correspondence with swedish sculptors and press <b>cuttings.</b> The <b>archives</b> include glass plates and photographs that depict the works created at the foundry. Decisions and motivations made during the process are treated in the paper. The author discusses availability and the weeding of business archives...|$|R
5000|$|The {{monument}} on Noon Hill {{has been}} excavated twice, first in 1958 {{and then a}} second time in 1963/4 by Bolton and District Archaeology Society (now Bolton Archaeology and Egyptology Society). During these excavation, the remains of three cremated people were found. Those {{in charge of the}} excavation found that the remains were that of an adult male, an adult female and a child. These remains were [...] "located beneath a collapsed enlarged food vessel and inserted into a central stone cist." [...] In addition to these central cremations, the remains of several secondary cremations were found alongside flint tools including barbed and tanged arrowheads, scrapers and a sacrificial knife with one serrated edge and a sharp <b>cutting</b> edge. The <b>archives</b> for these excavations, reports and photographs are now online at the BAES Archives.|$|R
30|$|The {{surface quality}} of chamfer milling of {{stainless}} steel is closed related to the products of 3 C (Computer, Communication and Consumer electronics), where a cutter is a major part to achieve that. Targeting a high-quality cutter, an experimental evaluation is carried out {{on the influence of}} grinding texture of cutter flank face on surface quality. The mathematic models of chamfer cutter are established, and they are validated by a numerical simulation. Also the grinding data are generated by the models and tested by a grinding simulation for safety reasons. Then, a set of chamfer cutting tools are machined in a five-axis CNC grinding machine, and consist of five angles between the cutting edge and the grinding texture on the 1 st flank faces, i.e., 0 °, 15 °, 30 °, 45 ° and 60 °. Furthermore, the machined cutting tools are tested in a series of milling experiments of chamfer hole {{of stainless steel}}, where cutting forces and surface morphologies are measured and observed. The results show that the best state of both surface quality and <b>cutting</b> force is <b>archived</b> by the tool with 45 ° grinding texture, which can provide a support for manufacturing of cutting tool used in chamfer milling.|$|R
40|$|Twelve Simple Dances (in 4 parts) {{uses the}} {{physical}} language of Martina Bergman Österberg's rational gymnastics {{as a vehicle}} to revisit our own archive. Part I (video) presents an intuitive interpretation of the written instructions of Österberg's movement regime set to Collectress compositions from the last 10 years, reworked into simple piano etudes. The film adopts the simplicity of the visual aesthetics from the turn of the century, drawing a link between movement, music and nature. Parts II and III. (Illustration) Through reviewing their photographic and film archive Collectress identified typical physical movements within their own practice, which they have sought to extend into suggested dances through illustrative drawing and pattern making. Part IV (video) responds to Bergman's holistic approach to health and well being, focusing on the details of each movement through breath. The temporal extension and duplication of Part I acknowledges Bergman's legacy and the impact it has had on our lives, and will have on future generations, through both physical education and women's emancipation. Each component of Twelve Simple Dances was made by members of Collectress individually, the collaboration coming through dialogue and discourse around the works. This collaborative, responsive practice is what maintains Collectress as a workable collective of composers, musicians, artists and performers who come together to share practice as simply and intuitively as they can. Martina Bergman Österberg (1849 - 1914) a pioneer educationalist working in the area of women's physical training and an early supporter of women's suffrage, taught at one of the founding colleges of the University of Greenwich: Dartford College of Physical Education. The archive of material documenting her influential teaching methods and the achievements of the women who followed them remains with the University. In addition to many photographs, its contents include books, manuscripts, registers, trophies, certificates and badges; alongside uniforms, clothing-lists and <b>cuttings.</b> Altogether the <b>archive</b> records one hundred years of radical change for women both within and beyond the field of "PT". In this exhibition, selected artists take a range of responses to the archive in a variety of media, including performance, painting and sound. They seek to explore not only the subject of the body as it is presented within the archive, but also the body of the researcher as it engages with it...|$|R
