25|$|The engine {{mounting}} was substantially different. Instead of being suspended from an alloy cradle {{as on the}} Mark A and B, the engine now sat in a steel cradle bolted to a steeply inclined steel tube that pivoted directly behind the engine through an alloy steering head bracket.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} study, the {{microstructural}} features, wear characteristics, and corrosion behaviour of spray cast Al– 12 Si, Al– 15 Si, and Al– 20 Si alloys have been investigated. The <b>alloys</b> were spray <b>cast</b> and hot isostatically pressed. Hot isostatic pressing has considerably reduced the porosity in spray <b>cast</b> <b>alloys.</b> The microstructure of spray <b>cast</b> <b>alloys</b> showed fine and globular-shaped Si {{particles in the}} Al matrix in contrast to needle-type eutectic Si and blocky-type primary Si in the Al matrix in chill <b>cast</b> <b>alloys.</b> The dry sliding wear tests showed that the wear rates of spray <b>cast</b> <b>alloys</b> are invariably lower and the potentiodynamic polarization tests showed that the corrosion resistance of spray <b>cast</b> <b>alloys</b> is considerably {{higher than that of}} chill <b>cast</b> <b>alloys.</b> The high wear and corrosion resistance of spray <b>cast</b> <b>alloys</b> have been discussed {{in the light of the}} microstructural modification induced during the spray casting process...|$|R

40|$|THESIS 9658 The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} {{was to investigate the}} biocompatibility potential of commercially available non-precious dental <b>casting</b> <b>alloys</b> facilitated by multiple analyses using a two-dimensional (2 D) oral keratinocyte (TR 146) cell monolayer structure and a novel three-dimensional (3 D) human-derived, full-thickness, differentiated oral mucosal model. The first section of the study aimed to determine the influence of the surface finishing condition of a Ni-based (d. Sign? 10) dental <b>casting</b> <b>alloy</b> on the biocompatibility potential. The biocompatibility was determined following direct and indirect exposure of the dental <b>casting</b> <b>alloys</b> to the 2 D oral keratinocyte cell monolayer structures. The clinically relevant polished dental <b>casting</b> <b>alloys</b> induced significantly increased adverse biological effects compared with the ?as-cast? alumina particle air abraded alloys. In addition, the study showed that the use of trypsin-edetate disodium (EDTA) was inappropriate in the determination of the TR 146 cell density measurements and highlighted difficulties for comparisons with trypsin-EDTA-treated cell density studies in the dental literature. The biocompatibility potential of two polished Ni- based (d. Sign? 10 and d. Sign? 15) and a cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) (d. Sign? 30) dental <b>casting</b> <b>alloy</b> were investigated on the 2 D TR 146 cell monolayer structure and compared using multiple analyses. The d.

Sign? 10 alloy and the Co-Cr (d. Sign? 30) alloy. The influence of oral microorganisms (Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis) on the biocompatibility potential of the dental <b>casting</b> <b>alloys</b> was also determined using the 2 D TR 146 cell monolayer structure. Oral microorganisms were shown to enhance the loss of biocompatibility, possibly due to the decreased pH levels, which exacerbated metal ion leachate release levels from the alloys...|$|R

50|$|High {{strength}} {{beryllium copper}} alloys contain {{as much as}} 2.7% beryllium (cast), or 1.6-2% beryllium with about 0.3% cobalt (wrought). The strength is achieved by age hardening.

The wrought alloys are designated by UNS as C17200 to C17400, the <b>cast</b> <b>alloys</b> are C82000 to C82800. The hardening process requires rapid cooling of the annealed metal, resulting in a solid state solution of beryllium in copper, which is then kept at 200-460 °C {{for at least an}} hour, producing a precipitation of metastable beryllide crystals in the copper matrix.
