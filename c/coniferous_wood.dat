5|$|Antrodia serialiformis {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to A.serialis, but the latter has larger spores (6.3–8 by 2.2–3.3µm).

5|$|Volvariella bombycina is a {{saprobic}} species. Fruit bodies grow singly or {{in small}} groups on trunks and decayed stumps of dead hardwoods. Favored species include sugar maple, red maple, silver maple, magnolia, mango, beech, oak, and elm. It is often found in clefts and knotholes of dead or living tree trunks. It has been noted to fruit in the same location for several years. Despite its preference for hardwoods, {{it has been reported}} growing on rare instances on <b>coniferous</b> <b>wood.</b> An uncommon species with a wide distribution, it has been reported from Asia (China, India, Korea, Pakistan), the Caribbean (Cuba), Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. It acquired protected status in Hungary in 2005, making it a legal offense to pick it. Variety microspora is known from Venezuela, while V.bombycina var. palmicola occurs in the DR Congo.|$|E

25|$|Aside from water, wood {{has three}} main components. Cellulose, a {{crystalline}} polymer derived from glucose, constitutes about 41–43%. Next in abundance is hemicellulose, which is around 20% in deciduous trees but near 30% in conifers. It is mainly five-carbon sugars that are linked in an irregular manner, {{in contrast to}} the cellulose. Lignin is the third component at around 27% in <b>coniferous</b> <b>wood</b> vs. 23% in deciduous trees. Lignin confers the hydrophobic properties reflecting {{the fact that it is}} based on aromatic rings. These three components are interwoven, and direct covalent linkages exist between the lignin and the hemicellulose. A major focus of the paper industry is the separation of the lignin from the cellulose, from which paper is made.|$|E
