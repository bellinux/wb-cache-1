5|$|Clerici {{also wrote}} several scenes {{that did not}} make the film's final <b>cut.</b> <b>One</b> of which {{depicted}} a group of Ya̧nomamö cutting off the leg of a Shamatari warrior and feeding him to piranhas in the river. This scene was to take place directly after Monroe's team rescues a smaller group of Ya̧nomamö from the Shamatari. Attempts were made to film this scene, but the underwater camera did not operate properly, and the piranha were difficult to control. As a result, Deodato abandoned his efforts, and still photographs taken during the scene are its only known depiction.|$|E
5|$|Director Brad Bird {{wanted to}} open the episode with a close up of Krusty's face. The staff liked the idea and he then {{suggested}} that all three acts of the episode, defined by {{the placement of the}} commercial breaks, should begin with a close up shot. Act one begins with Krusty's face introducing the audience at his show, act two begins with Krusty's face being locked up behind bars, and act three begins with Sideshow Bob's face on a big poster. Krusty's character is based on a television clown from Portland, Oregon, called Rusty Nails, whom The Simpsons creator Matt Groening watched while growing up in Portland. The original teleplay, written by Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky, was 78 pages long and many scenes had to be <b>cut.</b> <b>One</b> scene that had to be cut down was the scene where Patty and Selma show the slideshow of their vacation; it originally contained images of them being detained for bringing heroin into America.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to requesting international aid, the Yemen government declared Hadhramaut and Al Mahrah governorates as disaster areas, after then-president Ali Abdullah Saleh surveyed the affected areas. The president also utilized the nation's military to assist storm victims, and sent aircraft with tents, food, and medicine {{to the worst}} hit areas. To {{raise money for the}} disaster recovery, the Yemeni government <b>cut</b> <b>one</b> day of salary for all workers, equating to $4.25million, and the government provided another $100million from its annual budget. Local charities and residents collectively raised $8.5million. Yemen's Red Cross provided meals and water to about 21,000people. The agency also provided school kits for 4,500students whose facilities were damaged. Ultimately, the Red Cross assisted over 70,000storm victims through health programs, and also helped residents cope with stress, hygiene promotion, and other ongoing vulnerabilities to their livelihoods.|$|E

50|$|A {{nicking enzyme}} (or nicking endonuclease) is an enzyme that <b>cuts</b> <b>one</b> strand of a {{double-stranded}} DNA {{at a specific}} recognition nucleotide sequences known as a restriction site.

The tiling obtained {{in this way}} is non-periodic: there is no non-zero shift that leaves this tiling fixed. But clearly this example is much less interesting than the Penrose tiling. In order to rule out such boring examples, one defines an aperiodic tiling to be one that does not contain arbitrary large periodic parts.|$|E
25|$|Although artisanal logging {{provides}} some {{income for the}} community in the short-run, it ultimately does not improve local living conditions. In the end, the communities receive payments which are not large {{enough to cover the}} loss of their natural resources. Since there is no monitoring mechanism, the loggers report lower harvested amounts than they actually do in order to pay less tax to the local government. Some loggers <b>cut</b> <b>one</b> tree within the woods and leave the rest intact to mimic natural disturbance. To improve the situation, the DRC government needs better monitoring and better forest code to manage the logging activities.|$|E
25|$|In 1871, Mussorgsky began {{recasting}} {{and expanding}} the opera with enthusiasm, ultimately {{going beyond the}} requirements of the directorate of the Imperial Theatres, which called simply for the addition of a female role and a scene to contain it. He added three scenes (the two Sandomierz scenes and the Kromï Scene), <b>cut</b> <b>one</b> (the scene 'At the Cathedral of Vasiliy the Blessed'), and recomposed another (the Terem Scene). The modifications resulted in the addition of an important prima donna role (Marina Mniszech), the expansion of existing female roles (additional songs for the Hostess, Fyodor, and the Nurse), and the expansion of the first tenor role (the Pretender). Mussorgsky augmented his adaptation of Pushkin's drama with his own lyrics, assisted by a study of the monumental History of the Russian State by Karamzin, to whom Pushkin's drama is dedicated.|$|E

The failure of the Germans to agree to any sort of naval arms control caused the government to reinstate the third ship. The Admiralty took until 12 June 1907 to decide not to build one of them as a battlecruiser, in favour of a squadron of four homogeneous battleships. Three of these would be part of the St Vincent class, while the single battleship planned for the 1908–1909 Naval Programme was later authorised as [...]|$|E

[...] On April 10, 1924, the Goldwyn Company officially agreed to merge with Metro Pictures, putting von Stroheim's nemesis Thalberg directly in charge of Greed. Von Stroheim and Louis B. Mayer had a lengthy confrontation over the film's editing, which according to both men ended with von Stroheim claiming that all women were whores and Mayer punching him. Mayer disliked the film because of its lack of glamor, optimism or morality and considered it to be a guaranteed flop.|$|E

He worked his way up to the top 10 during the race, led a lap, and finished ninth as he ran out of fuel at the end of the race.

500|$|Salih {{was among}} those {{tortured}} by Mansur. Moreover, Salih was forced to divorce his wife and cousin Tarud, who was famed for her beauty, so that Mansur could wed her.

Mansur frequently threatened to execute Salih, who upon being informed of these threats, escaped the citadel. According to the versions of medieval chroniclers, Salih managed to <b>cut</b> <b>one</b> of his shackles and make a hole in his cell wall. Then, on the night of 3 July 1014, he jumped from the wall of the citadel with one shackle still attached to his leg and hid in a drain pipe {{for the remainder of the}} night until re-joining his tribesmen at their encampment in Marj Dabiq.
