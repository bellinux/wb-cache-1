As different as these groups were, their histories displayed a <b>common</b> <b>thread</b> of forced relocation.|$|E

When multiple threads must be laid next to each other, a technique called bricking is used: {{the position of the}} couching stitches is offset between rows, producing an appearance similar to a brick wall.

As the investigation proves to be unfruitful, the king's weapons master, Lord de Beauterne, arrives to put an end to the beast. However, instead of doing so, Beauterne kills an ordinary wolf and tells Fronsac to alter the corpse so it resembles the monster. Fronsac hesitantly does so, and the bogus wolf is sent back to Paris, where it is put on display, much to the pleasure of the king and the French aristocracy.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the activists}} {{did not succeed}} in saving the theater, Fields {{captured}} their tumultuous efforts on film and this resulted in two films: Saving The Indian Hills and footage that later became the core of Preserve Me A Seat. The later film enlarges the focus of Saving The Indian Hills to the entire United States. It presents the story of the Indian Hills Theater Preservation Society, the Omaha group that formed to save the theater, in context with the companion stories of similar groups that formed in other cities with the intention of saving their own theater palaces from the wrecking ball. Because of the controversy surrounding its Indian Hills Theater elements, the film's premier faced long delays while litigation got resolved. The world premiere occurred in Grand Island, NE Nebraska. After the feature a lively panel discussion occurred featuring the film-makers and theater developer, Paul Warshauer. The <b>common</b> <b>thread</b> of the theater preservation efforts within Preserve Me A Seat is their lack of success.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, these uniforms became outdated. The Fechheimer Bros. of Cincinnati {{created some}} uniforms for OSU. These uniforms {{were the same}} navy blue as the {{previous}} uniforms, except the buttons were changed to silver. At this time the chin straps and Eagle Ohio were also changed to silver. The plumes took on the modern red and gray appearance and were constructed of tough turkey feathers. The spats were changed from cloth to vinyl during this time as well. The shoulder patches changed design and size. The uniforms changed very little from the 1970s until 1988, except for things like hat manufacturer, a short period in which a large metal diamond Ohio replaced the Eagle Ohio, {{and the use of}} aluminum hat bands instead of the silver adjustable type. After the directorship of Charles Spohn, the Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma recognition bars were no longer authorized for wear on the OSUMB uniform. During the expansion years in the 1970s, many uniforms dating back to the 1940s had to be dug out of storage and updated with the current patch designs of the band. To a careful and up-close observer, one would notice significant differences in the cut and style of the uniforms being worn. Even hats were not standardized. The only <b>common</b> <b>thread</b> among the uniforms was the color, which even began to fade on older uniforms. It was common practice for band members to use black marker to fix frayed parts of the uniform which exposed white cotton lining. These uniforms also had to be used by the Military band, and were falling apart. Pieces were sourced as needed from manufacturers such as Ostwald, Bayly, Frechheimer, and DeMoulin Brothers. The Fechheimer Corporation began producing a police uniform in the 1980s that matched the design of the Marching Band uniforms. These eventually became the standard replacement uniform coat until 1989, when Dr. Woods commissioned a new uniform style.|$|E
