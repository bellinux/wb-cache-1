5|$|In the 21st century {{there have}} been three large {{fundraising}} campaigns at the Gallery: in 2004, to buy Raphael’s Madonna of the Pinks, in 2008, for Titian's Diana and Actaeon, and in 2012, Titian's Diana and Callisto. Both Titians were bought in tandem with the National Gallery of Scotland for £95m. Both of these major works were sold from the famous collection of the Duke of Sutherland. The National Gallery is now largely priced out of the market for Old Master paintings and <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>make</b> such acquisitions with the backing of major public appeals; the departing director Charles Saumarez Smith expressed his frustration at this situation in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Mutations {{that affect}} the rate or the extent of RCL {{insertion}} into the A-sheet can cause the serpin to undergo its S to R conformational change before having engaged a protease. Since a serpin <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>make</b> this conformational change once, the resulting misfired serpin is inactive and unable to properly control its target protease. Similarly, mutations that promote inappropriate transition to the monomeric latent state cause disease by {{reducing the amount of}} active inhibitory serpin. For example, the disease-linked antithrombin variants wibble and wobble, both promote formation of the latent state.|$|E

With direct selection a body part, pointer, adapted mouse, joystick, or eye tracking could be used, whereas switch access scanning is often used for indirect selection. Unlike direct selection (e.g., typing on a keyboard, touching a screen), users of Target Scanning <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>make</b> selections when the scanning indicator (or cursor) of the electronic device is on the desired choice. Those who are unable to point typically calibrate their eyes to use eye gaze as a way to point and blocking as a way to select desired words and phrases. The speed and pattern of scanning, as well as the way items are selected, are individualized to the physical, visual and cognitive capabilities of the user.|$|E

25|$|An unmoved pawn {{can move}} one step, {{up to the}} middle of the board (in the case of the 16×16 board, the eighth rank), or {{anything}} in between. Thus, 1.i8 is a legal opening move, and so are 1.i3, 1.i4, 1.i5, 1.i6, and 1.i7. Once it has moved for the first time, it <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>make</b> one step at a time. (In the case of an 8×8 board, this is exactly the same as in standard chess). Such a long initial pawn move allows the moving pawn to be captured en passant by an enemy pawn as if it had stopped on any one of the squares it had passed through.|$|E

25|$|However, {{during his}} imprisonment, PNI had been {{splintered}} by oppression of colonial authorities and internal dissension. The original PNI was disbanded by the Dutch, and its former members formed two different parties; the Partai Indonesia (Partindo) under Sukarno's associate Sartono who were promoting mass agitation, and the Pendidikan Nasional Indonesia (PNI Baroe) under Mohammad Hatta and Soetan Sjahrir, two nationalists who {{recently returned from}} studies in the Netherlands, and who were promoting a long-term strategy of providing modern education to the uneducated Indonesian populace to develop an intellectual elite able to offer effective resistance to Dutch rule. After attempting to reconcile the two parties to establish one united nationalist front, Sukarno chose to become the head of Partindo on 28 July 1932. Partindo had maintained its alignment with Sukarno's own strategy of immediate mass agitation, and Sukarno disagreed with Hatta's long-term cadre-based struggle. Hatta himself believed Indonesian independence would not occur within his lifetime, while Sukarno believed Hatta's strategy ignored the fact that politics <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>make</b> real changes through formation and utilisation of force (machtsvorming en machtsaanwending).|$|E

500|$|Author Bob Perelman {{takes the}} {{suspicion}} of empiricism {{one step further}} in his 1994 The Trouble With Genius: Reading Pound, Joyce, Stein, and Zukofsky. Perelman discusses the parable as one of two anecdotes in ABC of Reading that frame Pound's discussion of Chinese ideograms. The former describes attendance at two hypothetical concerts: one of Debussy and another of Ravel. Pound states {{that a person who}} attended both concerts knows more about the composers than someone who has only read [...] "ALL of the criticisms that have ever been written of both". Perelman considers the contradiction between [...] "everyone" [...] and [...] "knowledge" [...] to be the key to Pound's thinking: only a gifted or lucky few are able to apprehend the truth (whether by attending the concert or observing the specimen); the rest <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>make</b> do with [...] "a fog of clichés, received ideas, second-hand and second-rate opinions, written darkness." [...] With regard to the parable, Perelman observes the lack of [...] "scientific institutions, pedagogic procedures, or communicable terminologies" [...] where any mediating written descriptions ("sunfish", [...] "diplodokus") only serve to obscure knowledge. Knowledge ultimately resides within Agassiz rather than the world, and [...] "hat looks initially like a commitment to empiricism has led instead to an authoritarian idealism." ...|$|E
500|$|Storm petrels are monogamous {{and form}} {{long-term}} pair bonds that last {{a number of}} years. Studies of paternity using DNA fingerprinting have shown that, unlike many other monogamous birds, infidelity (extra-pair mating) is very rare. As with the other Procellariiformes, a single egg is laid by a pair in a breeding season; if the egg fails, then usually no attempt is made to re-lay (although it happens rarely). Both sexes incubate in shifts of up to six days. The egg hatches after 40 or 50 days; the young is brooded continuously for another 7 days or so before being left alone in the nest {{during the day and}} fed by regurgitation at night. Meals fed to the chick weigh around 10–20% of the parent's body weight, and consist of both prey items and stomach oil. Stomach oil is an energy rich (its calorific value is around 9600 calories per gram) oil created by partly digested prey {{in a part of the}} foregut known as the proventriculus. By partly converting prey items into stomach oil storm petrels can maximise the amount of energy chicks receive during feed, an advantage for small seabirds that <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>make</b> a single visit to the chick during a 24-hour period (at night). The average age at which chicks fledge depends on the species, taking between 50 or 70 days. The time taken to hatch and raise the young is long for the bird's size but is typical of seabirds, which in general are K-selected, living much longer, delay breeding for longer, and invest more effort into fewer young. The young leave there burrow at about 62 days. They are independent almost at once and quickly disperse into the ocean. They return to their original colony after 2 [...] or 3 years, but will not breed until at least 4 years old. Storm petrels have been recorded living as long as 30 years.|$|E
