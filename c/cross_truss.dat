To investigate seismic behavior of this coupling beam, low cyclic loading tests for four full-scale specimens of steel truss coupling beam are presented. The specimens are designed considering three factors which are T-stub steel, angle steel and material strength. The experimental data show that steel truss coupling beam has good ductility, and can consume a great quantity of earthquake energy. By enlarging the sections of <b>cross</b> abdominal <b>trusses</b> and chord members, bearing capacity and stiffness of the whole coupling beam are greatly increased...|$|R

50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by James Barney Marsh and built in 1911, the same year in which he filed a patent for his rainbow arch design. His design features two arched ribs, one {{on either side of}} the roadway, rising above the deck. The deck is suspended from the arches by vertical risers. Drivers see the rainbow arch crowns on each side, similar to <b>crossing</b> a pony <b>truss</b> bridge. The bridge over the Little Cottonwood River is one of the oldest Marsh rainbow arches in the country. Unfortunately, as traffic flow increased and farm machinery got larger, many of Marsh's rainbow arch designs became obsolete, since they could not be widened. There are only half a dozen Marsh rainbow arch bridges remaining in Minnesota.|$|R

40|$|Programa de Pós Graduação em Engenharia Civil. Departamento de Engenharia Civil, Escola de Minas, Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto. A tipologia estrutural de um projeto de um galpão de uso geral é comumente definida através da experiência dos projetistas e calculistas de estrutura metálica. O processo de decisão entre os diferentes tipos de sistemas estruturais não é uma matéria amplamente discutida nos projetos de engenharia civil. As competitividades das estruturas de galpões de uso geral exigem respostas rápidas e econômicas frente ao mercado consumidor. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar, comparativamente, o desempenho de alguns sistemas estruturais comumente empregados para galpões de uso geral compostos por vigas de cobertura em perfis formados a frio. Para se avaliar o desempenho de alguns sistemas estruturais, foram considerados pórticos transversais com as seguintes tipologias: pórtico de alma cheia, pórtico com treliça em arco, pórtico com treliça de banzos paralelos, pórtico com treliça {{trapezoidal}} e pórtico com treliça triangular, com vãos livres de 16, 20, 24, 28 e 32 metros, distância entre pórticos de 6 7. 5 e 9 metros e velocidade básica do vento igual a 30, 35 e 40 m/s. Os galpões foram modelados, analisados e calculados no software mCalc 2008. Para avaliar a eficiência do sistema estrutural utilizou-se como parâmetro de avaliação a taxa de consumo de aço e a resposta estrutural dos sistemas. Conclui-se sobre o ponto de vista estrutural, dentre as tipologias e os parâmetros considerados nas análises, que os pórticos treliçados são mais eficientes que os pórticos em alma cheia. Das tipologias em pórticos treliçados, a treliça em arco é o mais eficiente para pequenos vãos, baixa ação do vento e baixo espaçamento entre os pórticos transversais. Para maiores vãos, a treliça trapezoidal e a treliça de banzos paralelos apresentam melhor desempenho. _________________________________________________________________________________ABSTRACT: The structural {{typology of}} industrial hangars projects is commonly defined {{by means of}} the designer`s experience. The decision process among the variety of structural systems is not a subject widely discussed on civil engineering projects. In projects of industrial hangars, the experience of the designer is crucial for the decision of the most appropriate structural typology. Despite the variety of the structural solutions, the high competitiveness of this type of structures requires quick and economic responses in front of the consumer market. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate comparatively the performance of some usual structural systems for industrial sheds, made of cold formed profiles. For the development of this study, there were considered frames with cross sections of the following types: frames with I-shaped cross sections, frames with arch truss, frames with trusses of parallel chords, frames with trapezoidal truss and frames with triangular truss. The free spans studied were of 16, 20, 24, 28 and 32 meters; the distance between frames, 6, 7. 5 and 9 meters, as well as the basic wind speeds of 30, 35 and 40 m/s. The sheds were modeled, analyzed and calculated in by software mCalc 2008. The study used the rate of consumption of steel and the structural response as a parameter of evaluation of efficiency of the different structural systems presented. Therefore, from the structural behavior point of view, considering all the typologies and parameters evaluated, the frames with <b>trussed</b> <b>cross</b> sections are more efficient than the frames with Ishaped cross sections. Among the typologies of <b>trussed</b> <b>cross</b> sections studied, the arch truss is the most efficient for small free spans, low wind loads and small distances between frames. For lager free spans, the trapezoidal truss and the parallel uprights truss have presented the best performance...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSince December 2015, a {{new steel}} bridge spans the Danube River in Bratislava {{in place of}} the Old Bridge which was {{disassembled}} in 2014. A detail design and construction of the bridge is described in the article. The bridge carries trams, pedestrians and cyclists. The bridge has also been designed for future use of tram-trains. It crosses the Danube River with a navigation clearance of 100 m by 10 m and both embankments. The bridge has spans 32. 56 + 106. 68 + 137. 16 + 75. 6 + 75. 92 + 32. 56 m. The superstructure is formed by two steel lattice girders of the total height of 11. 285 m in the distance of 11 m. The rails rests on longitudinal stringers supported by <b>truss</b> <b>cross</b> girders which are overhanging outside the main girders in order to support pedestrians and cycle path as well. The standard deck width of 22. 25 m is enlarged above river piers by observatory platforms to the total width of 33. 25 m. Old piers 2, 5, 6, 7 dated from 1890 have been reconstructed. They are formed by original stone masonry walls with concrete core. Piers 3 and 4 were completely demolished and have been replaced by a new pier 34. The superstructure was incrementally launched into its final position supported by piers and a temporary floating support which was used for the main spans of 106. 68 and 137. 16 m in the Danube River. The movement of the floating support was provided by the launched bridge. An interaction between the bridge and the floating support was taken into account in the analysis and is described in the article. During the launching, both the bridge and the floating support were carefully monitored. A comparison of theoretical assumptions and measured values are presented in the paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{dependence}} of strip antenna steady state geometric errors on member length uncertainties in the supporting truss beam is studied with the Monte Carlo {{analysis of a}} representative truss design. The results, presented in a format streamlined for practical use, can guide the specification for hardware fabrication of required error tolerances (for structural properties as well as member lengths), or they can aid the prediction of antenna performance if component statistics are available. The standard rms error and locally defined errors are both considered. (The latter quantify surface and slope discontinuities between trusdantenna bays- discontinuities that may limit the effec-tiveness of some electronic error compensation schemes.) Second order global error compensation along the antenna length is also simulated. The judicious definition of normalized variables leads to a straightforward set of scaling laws that easily relate the results to various truss dimensions and member length error magnitudes for trusses up to 100 bays long. The data pools on which quantitative observations are based are each populated by 35, 000 (thirty-five thousand) to 3, 465, 000 (nearly {{three and a half}} million) elements.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{numerical}} simulation of flume experiment {{was performed to}} investigate the behaviors of flow motion of debris flow. Two dimensional finite difference program FLO- 2 D was adopted as a numerical tool for the calculation. Incorporating with non-Newtonian fluid rheological constitutive relations, the numerical model employs central finite difference method to solve the governing equations. The rheological relations define the shear stress of sediment in terms of yield stress, viscosity and turbulent-dispersive stress. Meanwhile, the viscosity and turbulent-dispersive stress are function of shear strain rate or velocity gradient. Initially, the numerical model was established using scaling factor to magnify the scale of geometry of flume channel. Subsequently the numerical simulation of flume experiment of debris flow was implemented using the inputs of hydraulic parameters (discharge rate and Manning coefficient), material parameters (specific gravity, volumetric concentration of sediment and rheological coefficients) and controlling parameters (elapsed time of simulation and type of governing equation). The numerical results of flow motion and deposition characteristics were then compared with those from the experimental measurements and empirical calculations. The {{first part of the}} study emphasized on the comparisons of flow motion and deposition characteristics of mud slurry and mud-gravel mixture through a systematically numerical investigation of flume experiment. It was found that the mud slurry has higher potential of lateral dispersion and better capability of water conservation whereas the gravel-mud mixture possesses the characteristics of dewatering, deceleration and high invasion potential. Because of the dewatering and deceleration effects of gravel-mud mixture, an intermittent deposition frequently occurs at the deposition zone. At the meantime, the impact pressure induced by the collision of grain particle in sediment increases due to the addition of gravel material. From the viewpoint of hazard prevention, debris flow with gravel-mud mixture type may possess higher potential of catastrophic disaster. The second part of the study concentrated on the flow depth, velocity field and impact during the flow motion. The numerical result of sediment concentration was compared with those from previous studies for further verification. According to the numerical results, except the simulation of deposition thickness, the numerical calculations of deposition length, area and volume are reasonably in agreement with the experimental measurements and empirical estimations. 本研究採用FLO- 2 D二維有限差分程式作為數值運算工具，進行一系列之流槽試驗數值模擬，以探討土石流之運動行為。該程式採用非牛頓流體流變模式與中央有限差分法求解控制方程式。流變關係中定義土石流沉積物承受之剪應力為為降伏剪應力、黏滯力及紊流-離散應力函數，其中黏滯力及紊流-離散應力可再表示為剪應變率及速度梯度之函數。首先，利用比例因子(Scaling factor) 來建立流槽幾何數值模式，其次再輸入水文參數（流量、曼寧係數）、材料參數（比重、體積濃度及流變係數）及控制參數（模擬時間、控制方程式），進行土石流流槽試驗數值模擬。土石流運動與堆積特性之模擬結果可與實際觀測值及經驗推估值進行比較。 本研究第一部份針對泥漿體與礫石-泥漿混合體二種試料進行一系列流槽試驗數值模擬。由模擬結果發現泥漿體試料之橫向擴散能力及保水性較佳。另外，礫石-泥漿混合體試料則具有脫水、減速及直進性强之特性。因此，在堆積區常發生間歇性堆積。同時礫石-泥漿混合體試料由於礫石的加入使體積濃度增加，造成顆粒頻繁碰撞並誘發相當撞擊壓力。因此，以土石流防治的觀點來看，礫石-泥漿混合型之土石流,將具有較高之潛在危害度。 第二部份研究著重在土石流流深及流場之模擬。除此之外，土石流體積濃度之數值分析結果也與過去研究成果作比較，以便獲得近一步驗證。根據數值分析結果，除堆積厚度有較大之差異外，堆積長度、面積及體積之計算值皆與試驗實際觀測值及經驗推估值相近。Table of Contents Chapter Title Page Abstract i Acknowledgments iii Table of Contents iv List of Tables viii List of Figures ix List of Symbols xiii Ⅰ Introduction 1 1. 1 General 1 1. 2 Objectives of the Study 2 1. 3 Methodology 3 Ⅱ Literature Review 4 2. 1 General 4 2. 1. 1 Introduction of debris flow 4 2. 1. 2 Main features of flow motion 10 2. 2 Mathematical model of debris flow 15 2. 2. 1 Theoretical assumption 15 2. 2. 2 Governing equation 15 2. 2. 3 Rheology of debris flow 20 2. 2. 4 Sediment concentration 29 2. 2. 5 Bed Shear Stress 32 2. 3 Demonstrative Studies on Flume experiment on the motion and behaviors of debris flow 33 2. 3. 1 A Initiation and flow of various types of debris-flow 33 2. 3. 2 Experimental study of the underground sound generated by debris flows 36 2. 3. 3 Motion of landslide-induced debris 38 2. 3. 4 Experimental study on bed material entrain into debris-flow 40 2. 3. 5 Phreatic line and dynamic impact in laboratory debris flow experiments 43 2. 3. 6 Experimental analysis of the general features of uniform debris-flow over a loose bed 44 2. 3. 7 Debris flow generated by seepage failure of landslide dams 47 2. 3. 8 Threshold criterion for debris-flow initiation due to channel-bed failure 49 2. 3. 9 The debris-flow rheology myth 52 2. 3. 10 Shape of deposition fan and run out distance of debris-flow: Effects of granular and water contents 54 2. 4 Demonstrative Studies on Flume experiment on the prevention and cure engineering of debris flow 56 2. 4. 1 Debris-trapping efficiency of <b>crossing</b> -
