2500|$|In 1952, Young stunned {{observers}} when {{he appeared}} before the McCarthy era House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) and defied the congressmen with sarcastic retorts and repeatedly refused to answer {{whether or not he}} was a member of the Communist Party. The encounter came at a highly publicized formal hearing in Detroit. Young’s performance made him a hero in Detroit’s growing black community. [...] On HUAC’s charge that he seemed reluctant to fight communism, Coleman said: “I am not here to fight in any un-American activities, because I consider the denial of the right to vote to large numbers of people all over the South un-American.” On the HUAC congressman from Georgia: “I happen to know, in Georgia, Negro people are prevented from voting by virtue of terror, intimidation and lynchings. It is my contention you would not be in <b>Congress</b> <b>today</b> if it were not for the legal restrictions on voting on the part of my people.” [...] On the HUAC committee: “Congressman, neither me or none of my friends were at this plant the other day brandishing a rope in the face of John Cherveny, a young union organizer and factory worker who was threatened with repeated violence after members of the HUAC alleged that he might be a communist, I can assure you I have had no part in the hanging or bombing of Negroes in the South. I have not been responsible for firing a person from his job for what I think are his beliefs, or what somebody thinks he believes in, and things of that sort. That is the hysteria that has been swept up by this committee.” ...|$|E

5000|$|The growing {{autonomy}} of committees has fragmented {{the power of}} each congressional chamber as a unit. This dispersion of power has possibly weakened the legislative branch relative {{to the other two}} branches of the federal government, the executive branch and the judiciary branch. In his often cited article History of the House of Representatives, written in 1961, American scholar George B. Galloway (1898-1967) wrote: [...] "In practice, Congress functions not as a unified institution, but as a collection of semi-autonomous committees that seldom act in unison." [...] Galloway went on to cite committee autonomy as a factor interfering with the adoption of a coherent legislative program. Such autonomy remains a characteristic feature of the committee system in <b>Congress</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
