Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: University-based rehabilitation centre. Subjects: Thirty-three women (mean age 61. 8 years, standard deviation 5. 3) participated in this cross-sectional study. Methods: Time taken to complete the FTSTS with different seat heights (85 %, 100 % and 115 % of knee height) and arm positions (arms across chest, or hands on thighs) was measured with a stopwatch. Results: FTSTS <b>completion</b> <b>times</b> differed significantly between seat heights of 85 % and 115 % knee height and between seat heights of 100 % and 115 % knee height for both arm positions. There {{was no significant difference}} between FTSTS <b>completion</b> <b>times</b> for the 2 arm positions at any seat height.

Team Phoenix responded by making their first five shots in a single attempt each. However, they needed 22attempts to make the half-court shot, finishing with a time of 1minute and 19seconds. Team Detroit won their second Shooting Stars title, joining Team San Antonio as the only two-time winners of the competition.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: University-based rehabilitation centre. Subjects: Twenty-nine people with stroke and 30 healthy older adults. Methods: SWOC <b>completion</b> <b>times</b> and step counts were measured under 3 conditions: (i) normal walking; (ii) walking with a tray; and (iii) walking with dark-glasses. The Fugl-Meyer Assessment of lower extremity, the Five-Times-Sit-to-Stand Test, the Berg Balance Scale, the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), and the Community Integration Measure questionnaire, were also administered. Results: SWOC <b>completion</b> <b>times</b> and step counts showed very satisfactory to excellent reliabilities (intraclass correlation coefficient; ICC[*]=[*] 0. 851 – 0. 993). TUG times correlated significantly with SWOC <b>completion</b> <b>times</b> and step counts under the 3 conditions (r[*]=[*] 0. 586 – 0. 815, p[*]< 0. 001).

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: University-based rehabilitation laboratory. Subjects: Forty-seven people with stroke and 35 healthy older adults. Methods: FTT <b>completion</b> <b>times</b> were measured along with a Fugl-Meyer assessment of the lower extremities (FMA-LE); Five Times Sit-To-Stand Test (FTSTST) <b>completion</b> <b>times,</b> Berg Balance Scale (BBS) scores; Timed "Up & Go" (TUG) test; and assessment using the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC). Results: FTT <b>completion</b> <b>times</b> showed good to excellent intra-rater, inter-rater and test-retest reliability. The minimal detectable change of FTT <b>completion</b> <b>times</b> was 7. 7 s. A cut-off time of 8. 8 s was found to discriminate well between people with stroke and healthy older adults.

50|$|This {{phenomenon}} occurs {{regardless of}} the individual's knowledge that past tasks of a similar nature have taken longer to complete than generally planned. The bias only affects predictions about one's own tasks; when outside observers predict task <b>completion</b> <b>times,</b> they show a pessimistic bias, overestimating the time needed. The planning fallacy requires that predictions of current tasks' <b>completion</b> <b>times</b> are more optimistic than the beliefs about past <b>completion</b> <b>times</b> for similar projects and that predictions of the current tasks' <b>completion</b> <b>times</b> are more optimistic than the actual time needed to complete the tasks. In 2003, Lovallo and Kahneman proposed an expanded definition as the tendency to underestimate the time, costs, and risks of future actions {{and at the same}} time overestimate the benefits of the same actions. According to this definition, the planning fallacy results in not only time overruns, but also cost overruns and benefit shortfalls.|$|R
