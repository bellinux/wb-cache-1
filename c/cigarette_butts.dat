5|$|After all the {{interviews}} concluded, {{the group of}} 208 men were convicted in summary courts-martial of disobeying orders, Article 4 of the Articles for the Government of the United States Navy (Rocks and Shoals). Each man was subject to forfeiture of three months' pay. A few of them were held as witnesses in the upcoming mutiny trial. The rest were split into smaller groups and shipped out to various places in the Pacific Theater. Carl Tuggle, one of the 208, said in 1998 {{that a group of}} prisoners including himself were assigned menial tasks such as cleaning latrines and picking up <b>cigarette</b> <b>butts</b> at a series of Pacific islands. After returning from active duty they each received bad conduct discharges, which meant the loss of virtually all veterans' benefits.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cigarette</b> <b>butts</b> are {{the most}} {{littered}} item in the world, with 4.5 trillion discarded annually. Estimates on the required time for <b>cigarette</b> <b>butts</b> to break down vary. They range from five years to 400 years for complete degradation.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{construction}} of the new Harrison Hall, a fire occurred in December 1946. It was spotted by a group of students on Sunday, December 1 at 7:45 p.m. resulting in 150 dollars worth of damage, and destroyed one of the stained glass windows inside of Harrison Hall. Although the cause of the fire was never determined, one of the managers of the building believed that <b>cigarette</b> <b>butts</b> were the cause for the fire.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, three kayakers {{contracted}} leptospirosis {{and suffered}} bouts of delusion and lung hemorrhaging after swallowing Yarra river water. Tests {{were conducted in}} the Yarra River and the Mullum Mullum Creek and the levels of many pathogens {{were found to have}} breached local and international standards for recreational water. This is documented in a 2007 report by EPA Victoria in which levels of Human faecal matter and E. coli were recorded and documented. Other major pollutants entering the creek via stormwater drains and surface runoff include dog feces, <b>cigarette</b> <b>butts,</b> packaging and other post-consumer waste.|$|E
25|$|Pedicabs are {{a common}} form of {{transport}} for weekend revellers, with the number operating in Edinburgh growing from only 2 in 2000 to 60 by 2008. This {{has led to a}} growing number of complaints from taxi cab drivers, who resent the competition. In one dispute, a pedicab cyclist was reported to have been attacked by a group of three taxi drivers, who kicked and headbutted him. In other cases, taxi drivers have thrown <b>cigarette</b> <b>butts</b> at pedicab cyclists, and in one case, threatened a cyclist with a Taser stun gun (possession of such a device is illegal in Scotland).|$|E

25|$|In early September 2015, an infamous {{incident}} was reported of a tourist {{being forced to}} swallow his own <b>cigarette</b> <b>butt</b> in a local bar in Davao City after the tourist refused {{to comply with the}} public anti-smoking ordinance of the city. Duterte was personally contacted by the bar owner and went into the bar and forced the tourist to swallow his <b>cigarette</b> <b>butt.</b> Duterte was then met with criticisms especially from the Commission on Human Rights (CHR).|$|R
25|$|The CIA's {{response}} was another distraction. To begin Operation Moonmark, the CIA {{arranged for the}} U.S. Air Force {{to use one of}} its C-130 Hercules to drop a BLU-82 bomb to blast a helicopter landing zone (HLZ). Several helicopters flew in, a team dropped into the HLZ long enough to scatter <b>cigarette</b> <b>butts,</b> old packing crates, and litter about to simulate an insertion, then were pulled out by the helicopters. For the next week, Air America Twin Otters overflew the phony HLZ dropping bogus parachutes and broadcasting helicopter racket. Thus the 15,000 lb (6,800 kilo) bomb served as a second diversion to the diversion.|$|E
25|$|Further {{signs of}} {{infiltration}} were {{found by the}} lead section and as the scouts tracked the footprints of the militiamen through a dried creek bed they discovered some empty food packets and old <b>cigarette</b> <b>butts,</b> confirming the presence of militia in the area. As the platoon harboured up for a short halt, a sentry {{on one of the}} machine guns that had been sited for all round defence spotted a group of three militiamen patrolling along the creek bed and interpreting this as an act of aggression under the ROE governing the deployment he opened fire, hitting the lead militiaman with about twenty rounds from the LSW, killing him.|$|E
25|$|King's addictions {{to alcohol}} and other drugs were so serious during the 1980s that, as he {{acknowledged}} in On Writing in 2000, he can barely remember writing Cujo. Shortly after the novel's publication, King's family and friends staged an intervention, dumping on the rug {{in front of him}} evidence of his addictions taken from his office including beer cans, <b>cigarette</b> <b>butts,</b> grams of cocaine, Xanax, Valium, NyQuil, dextromethorphan (cough medicine) and marijuana. As King related in his memoir, he then sought help, quit all drugs (including alcohol) in the late 1980s, and has remained sober since. The first novel he wrote after becoming sober was Needful Things.|$|E

25|$|On February 22, 2008, {{six members}} of a group calling {{themselves}} Barbarians assaulted 19-year-old Mathieu Roumi in the same Paris suburb of Bagneux where Halimi was kidnapped. For two hours the attackers tortured the young man. One shoved <b>cigarette</b> <b>butts</b> into his mouth, another took issue with Roumi's Jewish origin (paternal), grabbed correction fluid and scrawled sale juif ("dirty Jew") and sale PD ("dirty faggot") on his forehead. When the issue of his sexual orientation arose, one of them placed a condom on the tip of a stick and shoved it in Roumi's mouth. The six men proceeded to scream at him and threaten that he would die the way Halimi did. The men were all arrested.|$|E
25|$|Schmeling's entourage also {{included}} an official Nazi Party publicist. The publicist not only controlled any possible contrarian remarks by Schmeling, but also issued statements {{that a black}} man could not defeat Schmeling, and that Schmeling's purse from the fight {{would be used to}} build more German tanks. Hitler himself lifted the nationwide 3:00 a.m. curfew so that cafés and bars could carry the broadcast for their patrons. As a result, the perception of the American public had turned decidedly against Schmeling between 1936 and 1938. Schmeling was picketed at his hotel room, received a tremendous amount of hate mail, and was assaulted with <b>cigarette</b> <b>butts</b> and other detritus as he approached the ring.|$|E
25|$|Another recent {{environmental}} issue in Melbourne was the Victorian government project of channel deepening Melbourne Ports by dredging Port Phillip Bay—the Port Phillip Channel Deepening Project. It {{was subject to}} controversy and strict regulations among fears that beaches and marine wildlife could {{be affected by the}} disturbance of heavy metals and other industrial sediments. Other major pollution problems in Melbourne include levels of bacteria including E. coli in the Yarra River and its tributaries caused by septic systems, as well as litter. Up to 350,000 <b>cigarette</b> <b>butts</b> enter the storm water runoff every day. Several programs are being implemented to minimise beach and river pollution. In February 2010, The Transition Decade, an initiative to transition human society, economics and environment towards sustainability, was launched in Melbourne.|$|E

25|$|In October 2013, an Oklahoma {{crime lab}} began re-examining {{fingerprints}} taken from scenes of unsolved murders. In February 2014, Creek's case was reopened; examiners in an Oklahoma crime lab {{were able to}} match a thumbprint on the garbage bag concealing the body to James Paul Eaton, a 36-year-old divorced man. Eaton was nineteen {{at the time of}} the murder and lived in Palatine, Illinois, the same town as Creek. One of the men seen with Amber in early February 1997 bore a strong resemblance to Eaton. Eaton's fingerprints were not on record {{at the time of the}} murder, recorded only in 2000 after his arrest for possession of drug paraphernalia. Investigators located the suspect in Chicago, and on March 22 collected discarded <b>cigarette</b> <b>butts</b> to match his DNA to that found at the crime scene. Eaton was subsequently arrested in early April and is currently incarcerated in Racine, Wisconsin. Authorities also looked though his computer, Facebook profile and phone, as well as searching his residence for possible souvenirs from the scene, as some of Amber's belongings had been suspected to have been taken by her killer.|$|E
500|$|Another of Carey's {{offers to}} {{contribute}} in helping others came in September 2014 when he promised $10,000 {{to help find}} the perpetrators of a faked [...] "ice bucket challenge" [...] involving an autistic 14-year-old Ohio boy who, instead of being doused in ice cubes and water, received a shower of feces, urine, spit and <b>cigarette</b> <b>butts.</b> Shortly thereafter, celebrities Donnie Wahlberg, Jenny McCarthy and Montel Williams matched Carey's offer.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Ride a White Horse" [...] was {{directed}} by Diane Martel and filmed in London, England in December 2005. The video features Alison Goldfrapp, {{dressed in a white}} dress, in multiple disturbing situations. The video begins with Goldfrapp, her back to the camera, trailing toilet paper from one of her spike heels, singing into a microphone made of a cardboard roll and aluminium foil. As she sings, footage of rotting food is displayed behind her. She is then shown eating a slice of pizza covered in <b>cigarette</b> <b>butts</b> and bottlecaps. The next scenes feature Goldfrapp pulling a large plastic dog; singing in front of a man bandaged in toilet paper eating from a garbage can; and dancing with dirty men that came out of a trashbin dressed in their underwear. The video concludes with Goldfrapp forcing the leg of the bandaged man into a toilet.|$|E

50|$|Sharon {{arranges}} {{a friend}} {{to repair the damage}} at a cut rate and Paudge is placated. Unfortunately {{over the past few weeks}} he has made an enemy of local petty criminal Ollie Coyne. Ollie breaks into the house and proceeds to vandalise it. Paudge gets the call from the alarm company and heads to the house. He arrives just as Ollie has finished destroying the place, and as he enters Ollie hides. Paudge breaks down when he sees the extensive damage done to his property. He then notices a still-lit <b>cigarette</b> <b>butt</b> belonging to Ollie. He fans the <b>cigarette</b> <b>butt,</b> purposely setting fire to the house. What Paudge doesn't know is that Ollie is secretly recording him on his phone.|$|R

500|$|Becky {{became the}} 50th barmaid at the Rovers Return Inn in June 2008. Kelly opined that the character's ex-con {{personality}} {{would give her}} an advantage behind the bar, explaining: [...] "The previous producer, Steve Frost, loved {{the idea of a}} barmaid who could lose her temper and throw a punch. Becky's an ex-con so she can fight dirty like nobody else." [...] The character's chain smoking tendencies often play out onscreen when she is experiencing stress, something which drew off-screen criticism for her disregard of littering the streets with her <b>cigarette</b> <b>butts.</b> ITV publicity has described Becky as having many different levels to her persona, stating that she loves drinking cider, and that she isn't bothered by how she looks—though when she dresses up she [...] "dresses to the nines" [...] with big earrings, gold rings, logo belts and hair pieces. She dislikes anyone ordering her about, as she cannot handle being told what to do.|$|E
500|$|He {{heads to}} her house, which is eerily quiet. Going in, he discovers {{a bottle of}} whiskey, several <b>cigarette</b> <b>butts,</b> and a {{telegram}} from the government. Dorothy's husband is dead, his plane shot down over France. Dorothy comes out of her bedroom, crying, and Hermie tells her [...] "I'm sorry." [...] The sense of empathy triggers her to channel to Hermie some of her loneliness. She turns on the record player and invites Hermie to dance with her. They kiss and embrace, tears on both their faces. Without speaking, and to the sound only of the waves, they move to the bedroom, where she draws him into bed and gently makes love with him. Afterward, withdrawing again into her world of hurt, Dorothy retires to the porch, leaving Hermie alone in her bedroom. He approaches her on the porch, where she can only quietly say [...] "Good night, Hermie." [...] He leaves, his last image of Dorothy being of her leaning against the railing, as she smokes a cigarette and stares into the night sky.|$|E

The first line of the book, [...] "There are no other Everglades in the world", {{has been called the}} [...] "most famous passage ever written about the Everglades", and the statement welcomes visitors to the Everglades National Park website. Douglas characterized the Everglades as ecosystems surrounding a river worthy of protecting, that was inescapably connected to the people and cultures of South Florida. She outlined its imminent disappearance in the last chapter titled [...] "The Eleventh Hour": Cattlemen's grass fires roared uncontrolled. Cane-field fires spread crackling and hissing in the saw grass in vast waves and pillars and billowing mountains of heavy, cream-colored, purple-shadowed smoke. Training planes flying over the Glades dropped bombs or <b>cigarette</b> <b>butts,</b> and the fires exploded in the hearts of the drying hammocks and raced on before every wind leaving only blackness...
