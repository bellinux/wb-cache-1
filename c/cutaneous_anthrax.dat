Respiratory {{infection in}} humans initially presents with cold or flu-like symptoms for several days, followed by severe (and often fatal) respiratory collapse. Historical mortality was 92%. Gastrointestinal infection in humans is most often caused by eating anthrax-infected meat and is characterized by serious gastrointestinal difficulty, vomiting of blood, severe diarrhea, acute inflammation of the intestinal tract, and loss of appetite.

40|$|Abstract Anthrax is {{a disease}} of herbivores caused by the gram-positive {{bacterium}} Bacillus anthracis. It can affect cattle, sheep, swine, horses and various species of wildlife. The routes for the spread among wildlife are reviewed. There are three kinds of human <b>anthrax</b> – inhalation, <b>cutaneous,</b> and intestinal <b>anthrax</b> – which differ in their routes of infection and outcomes. In the United States, confirmation of cases is made by the isolation of B. anthracis and by biochemical tests. Vac-cination is not recommended for the general public; civilians who should be vaccinated include those who, in their work places, {{come in contact with}} products po-tentially contaminated with B. anthracis spores, and people engaged in research or diagnostic activities. After September 11, 2001, there were bioterrorism an-thrax attacks in the United States: anthrax-laced letters sent to multiple locations were the source of infectious B. anthracis. The US Postal Service issued recommen-dations to prevent the danger of hazardous exposure to the bacterium. B. anthracis spores can spread easily and persist for very long times, which makes decontamina-tion of buildings very difficult. Early detection, rapid diagnosis, and well-coordinated public health response are the key to minimizing casualties. The US Govern-ment is seeking new ways to deter bioterrorism, includ-ing a tighter control of research on infectious agents, even though pathogens such as B. anthracis are widely spread in nature and easy to grow. It is necessary to define the boundary between defensive and offensive biological weapons research. Deterring bioterrorism should not restrict critical scientific research...|$|R
40|$|The Bacillus cereus {{group of}} {{bacteria}} is a subgroup in the Bacillus genus {{and consists of}} six different species. Research has evolved mainly around B. cereus, B. thuringiensis and B. anthracis, an opportunistic pathogen capable of food poisoning and infections in mammals, an insecticidal pathogen which can also be an opportunistic pathogen in mammals, and an opportunistic pathogen capable of causing <b>cutaneous</b> and or/systemic <b>anthrax</b> in mammals, respectively. These species are closely related based on analysis of chromosomal markers, but pathogenicity patterns vary mainly due to virulence factors carried on plasmids. Taxonomic differentiation has been, and continues to be, difficult, as many features used to classify the organisms are plasmid-borne. Several {{studies have shown that}} many strains in the B. cereus group are capable of producing biofilms, multicellular aggregates of cells that may contribute to virulence, antibiotic resistance and to reservoirs forming in food production facilities and hospitals. B. cereus, ubiquitously found as spores in soil, has been implicated in several cases of food spoilage. Research of biofilm formation in B. cereus is, therefore, important for economic and health- related purposes. One research group reported in 2008 that two c-di-GMP responsive riboswitches, non- translated regions of mRNA located at the 5 ’-end that may govern further expression of a downstream gene, had been identified in Bacillus cereus strains ATCC 14579 and ATCC 10987. Sequence searches based on the sequences of these riboswitches showed that two similar riboswitches were present in B. thuringiensis 407, and two genes were located downstream of these riboswitches, whose proteins contained domains typical of cell surface adhesion (Bt 407 _ 1060) and chemotaxis (Bt 407 _ 0422) proteins, respectively. As c-di-GMP is an important regulator of biofilm formation in gram-negative bacteria, it was decided to proceed with functional studies of these two proteins. The aim of this thesis was to expand on initial research performed on this topic in the group. The functional studies performed in this thesis confirmed that a gene deletion in Bt 407 _ 1060 (cell surface adhesion protein) resulted in reduced biofilm formation in a microtiter plate screening assay. Previous studies on adhesion proteins in gram-positive bacteria have shown an effect on biofilm formation when genes encoding the adhesion proteins were removed. No effect was observed on biofilm formation in a screening of the Bt 407 _ 0422 (methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein) gene deletion mutant compared to wildtype. Previous research in other bacteria has deemed chemotaxis as non-essential to biofilm formation, as opposed to the presence of flagella or motile behaviour, which seems of importance. However, in order to ratify these results, complementation and overexpression of the genes would be necessary. Future research should also focus on the role of c-di-GMP in the regulation of biofilm formation by B. cereus group bacteria to enhance our understanding of c-di-GMP regulated processes in gram-positive bacteria...|$|R
50|$|<b>Cutaneous</b> <b>anthrax,</b> {{also known}} as Hide porter's disease, is when anthrax occurs on the skin. It {{is the most common}} form (>90% of anthrax cases). <b>Cutaneous</b> <b>anthrax</b> is also the least {{dangerous}} form of anthrax (~0% mortality rate with treatment). <b>Cutaneous</b> <b>anthrax</b> presents as a boil-like skin lesion that eventually forms an ulcer with a black center (eschar). The black eschar often shows up as a large, painless necrotic ulcer (beginning as an irritating and itchy skin lesion or blister that is dark and usually concentrated as a black dot, somewhat resembling bread mold) at the site of infection. In general, cutaneous infections form within the site of spore penetration between two and five days after exposure. Unlike bruises or most other lesions, <b>cutaneous</b> <b>anthrax</b> infections normally do not cause pain. Nearby lymph nodes may become infected, reddened, swollen and painful. A scab forms over the lesion soon, and falls off in a couple of weeks. Complete recovery may take longer.Cutaneous anthrax is typically caused when B. anthracis spores enter through cuts on the skin.
