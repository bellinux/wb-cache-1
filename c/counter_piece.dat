40|$|DE 102006047683 B 3 UPAB: 20080421 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} {{moving a}} screw (3) and a clamping section (1), and/or a <b>counter</b> <b>piece</b> (2) relative {{to each other}} and provided in force or form-fitting contact such that a screw connection is force-balanced and/or a form-fit is partially released. A torque or force characterizing the connection is measured as a parameter during a relative movement between the screw and the section, and/or the piece and is compared with a reference parameter. A friction force path or a friction moment path is determined between the screw and the clamping section, and/or the <b>counter</b> <b>piece.</b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a device for recognizing a defective force or form-fitting connection i. e. screw connection. USE - Method for recognizing a defective force or form-fitting connection i. e. screw connection, by an on-screwing device. ADVANTAGE - The torque or force characterizing the screw connection is measured as the parameter during relative movement between the screw and the clamping section, and/or the <b>counter</b> <b>piece</b> and is compared with the reference parameter, thus automatically recognizing the defective force or form-fitting screw connection in a reliable manner during disassembling of the connection...|$|E

The frame {{for the analysis}} is set by the Danish government, through its publication ‘the government platform’, and its <b>counter</b> <b>piece,</b> DVCA, which is an association of venture capitalists. The analysis starts with an introduction of two forms of economical approaches, a micro-, and a macroeconomic aspect. The aim of introducing of the economical approach is to examine whether DVCA or the Danish government follows the underlying thoughts of theoretical economic, and if so how it affects the innovative entrepreneur. This is followed by another analysis, to determine if growth {{can be measured in}} other then money. The conclusion is based on equal parts of the first, and the second analysis, which aims to articulate the growth issue regarding the innovative entrepreneur in Denmark anno 2012...|$|E

50|$|The game {{came with}} a number of <b>counters</b> (playing <b>pieces)</b> which were not used with the basic game, but could be used for playing a variant game of Storm Over Arnhem. That variant game would be {{published}} in a future issue of Avalon Hill's The General Magazine. The variant was called The Crossing, and let the players recreate the famous and costly assault by Viktor Graebner's reconnaissance unit (of the German 9th SS Panzer Division) across the Arnhem bridge, where they suffered heavy losses. Also, the variant game begins on the evening of September 17, instead of the afternoon of September 18. The British units start out in the movement zones, and the only German units in Arnhem consist of a small Arnhem Garrison.|$|R

[Illustration] The players have twelve <b>counters</b> a <b>piece,</b> and each places {{two at a}} time upon any of the unoccupied angles, till all except the centre are filled up. The player who did not begin the game must now move a man; his object is to inclose one of his adversary's between two of his own, in which case he removes it, and is entitled to continue moving till he can no longer take. It is a game of some skill, and perpetual practice enables the Somal to play it as the Persians do backgammon, with great art and little reflection. The game is called Kurkabod when, as in our draughts, the piece passing over one of the adversary's takes it.|$|R

40|$|We apply Coevolutionary Temporal Difference Learning (CTDL) {{to learn}} small-board Go {{strategies}} represented as weighted <b>piece</b> <b>counters.</b> CTDL is a randomized learning technique which interleaves two search processes that operate in intra-game and inter-game mode. The intra-game learning {{is driven by}} gradient-descent Temporal Difference Learning (TDL), a rein-forcement learning method that updates the board evaluation function according to differences observed between its values for consecutively visited game states. For the inter-game learning component, we provide coevolutionary algorithm that maintains a sample of strategies and uses the outcomes of games played between them to iteratively modify the probability distribution, according to which new strategies are generated and added to the sample. We analyze CTDL’s sensitivity to all important parameters, including the trace decay constant that controls the lookahead horizon of TDL, and the relative intensity of intra-game and inter-game learning. We investigate also how the presence of memory (an archive) affects the search performance, and {{find out that the}} archived approach is superior to other techniques considered here, and produces strategies that outperform a handcrafted weighted <b>piece</b> <b>counter</b> strategy and a simple liberty-based heuristics. This en-couraging result can be potentially generalized not only to other strategy representations used for small-board Go, but also to different games and a broader class of problems, because CTDL is generic and does not rely on any problem-specific knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{compares the}} use of {{temporal}} difference learning (TDL) versus co-evolutionary learning (CEL) for acquiring position evaluation functions for the game of Othello. The paper provides important insights into {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of each approach. The main findings are that for Othello, TDL learns much faster than CEL, but that properly tuned CEL can learn better playing strategies. For CEL, it is essential to use parent-child weighted averaging in order to achieve good performance. Using this method a high quality weighted <b>piece</b> <b>counter</b> was evolved, and was shown to significantly outperform a set of standard heuristic weights...|$|R

25|$|Advanced Squad Leader (ASL) is a tactical-level board wargame, {{originally}} marketed by Avalon Hill Games, that simulates {{actions of}} approximately company or battalion size in World War II. It is a detailed game system {{for two or}} more players (with solitary play also possible). Components include the ASL Rulebook and various games called modules. ASL modules provide the standard equipment for playing ASL, including geomorphic mapboards and counters. The mapboards are divided into hexagons to regulate fire and movement, and depict generic terrain that can represent different historical locations. The <b>counters</b> are cardboard <b>pieces</b> that depict squads of soldiers, crews, individual leaders, support weapons, heavy weapons, and vehicles.|$|R

40|$|The {{cognitive}} {{operation of}} conceptual integration or blending {{as described by}} Fauconnier and Turner (1994, 1996) includes the notion of emergent structure, that is to say, conceptual structure, {{which is part of}} the blend and which is independent and/or inconsistent with that of the input spaces. Emergent structure is especially noticeable in <b>counter</b> factual <b>pieces</b> of advice of the type If I were you, I would [...] ., which involve the construction of a mental space which is contrary-to-fact with respect to both input spaces. Nevertheless, as argued by Ruiz de Mendoza (1998), this type of blend-internal asymmetries and inconsistencies are little desirable from the point of view of cognitive economy. In connection with this observation, this paper attempts to reanalyse and explain the performance of conterfactual advising by adequately combining data from as many input spaces as necessary to yield implicated information. In doing so, our account is free from the cognitive cost which may derive from the need of making sense of independent (and contradictory) emergent structure.

40|$|Difference Learning (CTDL), {{a hybrid}} of coevolutionary search and {{reinforcement}} learning proposed in our former study, to evolve strategies for playing the game of Go on small boards (5 × 5).

40|$|Coevolution is {{a natural}} choice for {{learning}} in problem domains where one agent's behavior {{is directly related to}} the behavior of other agents. However, there is a known tendency for coevolution to produce mediocre solutions. One of the main reasons for this is cycling, caused by intransitivities among a set of players. In this paper, we explore the link between coevolution and games, and revisit some of the coevolutionary literature in a games and measurement context. We propose a set of measurements to identify cycling in a population and a new algorithm that tries to minimize cycling in strictly competitive (zero sum) games. We experimentally verify our approach by evolving weighted <b>piece</b> <b>counter</b> value functions to play othello, a classic two-player perfect information board game.

40|$|Abstract — In pattern {{recognition}} area, an ensemble approach {{is one of}} promising methods to increase the accuracy of classification systems. It is interesting to use the ensemble approach in evolving game strategies because they maintain a population of solutions simultaneously. Simply, an ensemble is formed from a set of strategies evolved in the last generation. There are many decision factors in the ensemble of game strategies: evolutionary algorithms, fusion methods, and the selection of members in the ensemble. In this paper, several evolutionary algorithms (evolutionary strategy, simple genetic algorithm, fitness sharing, and deterministic crowding algorithm) are compared with three representative fusion methods (majority voting, average, and weighted average) with selective ensembles (compared with the ensemble of all members). Additionally, the computational cost of an exhaustive search for the selective ensemble is reduced by introducing multi-stage evaluations. The ensemble approach is tested on the Othello game with a weight <b>piece</b> <b>counter</b> representation. The proposed ensemble approach outperforms the single best individual from the evolution and ensemble searching time is reasonable. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Two {{learning}} {{methods for}} acquiring position evalu-ation for small Go boards are studied and compared. In each case the function {{to be learned}} is a position-weighted <b>piece</b> <b>counter</b> and only the learning method differs. The methods studied are temporal difference learning using the self-play gradient-descent method and co-evolutionary learning, using an evolution strategy. The two approaches are compared {{with the hope of}} gaining a greater insight into the problem of searching for “optimal ” zero-sum game strategies. Using tuned standard setups for each algorithm, {{it was found that the}} temporal-difference method learned faster, and in most cases also achieved a higher level of play than co-evolution, providing that the gradient descent step size was chosen suitably. The performance of the co-evolution method was found to be sensitive to the design of the evolutionary algorithm in several respects. Given the right configuration, however, co-evolution achieved a higher level of play than temporal difference learning. Self-play results in optimal play against a copy of itself. A self-play player will prefer moves from which it is unlikely to lose even when it occasionally makes random exploratory moves. An evolutionary player forced to perform exploratory moves in the same way can achieve superior strategies to those acquired through self-play alone. The reason for this is that the evolutionary player is exposed to more varied game-play, because it plays against a diverse population of players. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper briefly reviews testimonies in the Aegean and Hellenic {{world of}} certain classes of small {{artefacts}} which {{in other contexts}} have been explained – with different degrees of certitude – as ‘tokens’ and ‘counters’. The main proposals for their interpretation put forward so far are also examined. Among the artefacts possibly belonging to arithmetic or recording systems there are abundant sherd disks, perforated or not, corresponding to the “reworked sherd” of the Near Eastern classification. They result to be generally spread {{in the course of}} Neolithic through mainland Greece, in the islands, in Crete. On the other hand the diffusion of these pottery disks has been observed in many Mediterranean settlement sites, starting from the 3 rd millennium, then coinciding with the decline of Near Eastern tokens (that is the small hand shaped clay objects, an assemblage of which has been also recognized in Mycenae, Temple Complex, fill XI). Hellenic cut-discs are generally considered either game-pieces or stoppers / lids; recently they have been even explained as “convenient wipes”, destined to a hygienic function, because of their association with discarded materials of mixed domestic and artisanal provenance, dug in the Agora of Athens. The A. assumes that the great variety of contexts where these class of objects have been found is compatible with varoiuos different functions, including that of counting devices, applying to a broad variety of situations. In well determined and specialised contexts, the <b>counters</b> become game <b>pieces</b> or voting devices: leaving history for mythology, Achille’s armours are attributed thanks to a vote (krysis hoplon) through pebbles made under Athena’s eyes...|$|R
