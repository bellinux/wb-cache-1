40|$|This paper {{analyses}} fiduciary agreements, which, {{as a form}} <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> that is {{the means}} of securing obligation and legal claims, are regulated by provisions of specific laws and codifications {{in some of the}} European Union countries. Even the Montenegrin legislator enacted a special law governing these legal matters, however in the Serbian law fiduciary agreements fall into the category <b>of</b> innominate <b>contracts.</b> Fiducia originates in the Roman Law and constitutes the first common form <b>of</b> the <b>pledge</b> law. The Latin term fiducia means 'trust', since these legal matters were, first of all, based on the trust between contractual parties. This paper addresses the institution of 'trust' as it is the Anglo-Saxon counterpart of the fiduciary agreement. Etymologically, 'trust' has the same meaning as the term fiducia - trust. Due to their advantages, fiduciary agreements are not even uncommon in the domestic legal practice, while there are certain, as we have already announced, theoretical, but also practical concerns arguing admissibility of this legal matter. These arguments mainly come down to the thesis (mentioned above) that entering into the fiduciary agreement results in violation of the ban on performance <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> lex commissoria in the pledge law. Nevertheless, I provided explanation that differences between <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>pledge</b> and fiduciary agreements clearly point to the conclusion that fiduciary agreements may not be treated as a pledge, hence they are admissible, that is, they are concluded on the principle of contractual freedom as an imperative norm of the Law on Obligations. Fiduciary agreements (in relation to the realistic means of security) offer to the creditor a higher level of security, reduce the period of payment of his claims, also providing practical benefits for the debtor himself. The paper presents the reasons supporting the view that it would be advantageous for the Serbian legislator, in the process of harmonization of the legislation in the field of Civil Law with the European Union law, to regulate the institute of fiduciary agreements under the special law, integrate it into the Law on Obligations or make it a part of the future Civil Code of the Republic of Serbia...|$|R
50|$|Most {{contracts}} are not breached. The {{primary means of}} termination is by due and full and proper performance, which is usually rendered by the person on whom the duty to perform is imposed. The effect of proper performance or payment is to release the party concerned from his contractual obligation. Payment is the delivery of what is owed by a person competent to deliver to a person competent to receive. When made, it operates to discharge the obligation of the debtor. Proper performance of a party's obligation discharges not only that obligation but also any obligations accessory to it, such as <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> suretyship and <b>pledge.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The law <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> is hugely {{concerned}} with the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> debt, <b>of</b> <b>pledge</b> or mortgage, <b>of</b> bailments, of sale, of partnership, and of hire and service. The law <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> is not found in one place. The dharmaśāstras do not lay down a general code of rules applicable to all transfers of immovable property, nor do they treat of transfers by way of sale, mortgage or gift in separate sections." [...] Ancient writers largely commented on who was competent to enter into transactions. Those who are [...] "dependent, minors, extremely old, charged with grave sins, devoid of a limb, {{and those that are}} addicted to vices" [...] are considered incompetent and agreements with these people are invalid. Kauțilya holds that any contract made under the influence of intoxicants or wrath are invalid as well as those made when a person is distressed or has an unsound mind. Manu reinforces this by stating that all contracts entered into by force are invalid. Contracts that are contrary to the kings orders are regarded as invalid. According to Devaņa the king has the power to outlaw any agreements that are against śruti and smŗti or tainted by greed.|$|R

The nganga gathers materials, called nlongo (plural bilongo or milongo), which when assembled, {{will become the}} home of a spirit.

The nganga then either becomes possessed with the spirit or places the finished nkondi in a graveyard or other place where spirits frequent. Once it is charged, the nkondi can then be handed over to the client.

The thesis is structured as follows: introduction, three main chapters which constitute the body of the thesis, and conclusion. The first chapter called general introduction deals with the concept <b>of</b> a <b>pledge,</b> in particular its main principles and functions. It further introduces the parties to a relationship established by a pledge and the institute <b>of</b> future <b>pledge</b> together with its practical applications. The second chapter called creation <b>of</b> a <b>pledge</b> provides the overview of individual titles based on which and modes in which a pledge may be created. The chapter describes creation <b>of</b> <b>pledge</b> by (i) an agreement (ii) a decision of a public authority; or (iii) a statute. This chapter further focuses on pledge creation modes as listed in the Civil Code and the Insolvency Act. The chapter also pays special attention to the creation <b>of</b> a <b>pledge</b> by registration in the public registers, the issue of public registers and the effects of material publicity principle.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} law <b>of</b> <b>pledging</b> as {{presented}} in the early Irish laws and draws connections to its relations within the overall system of security. At the centre of my research stands the question what pledges Irish law recognised and how their application was determined, so as to provide a paradigm for the law <b>of</b> <b>pledging</b> in its entirety. A pledge is usually a movable, material object of symbolic and economic worth that is given to another person as a security deposit for an outstanding obligation. The main findings of this thesis are a first paradigm of the law <b>of</b> <b>pledging</b> and a methodological and contextual categorisation of all types <b>of</b> <b>pledges</b> that opens doors for future research into property law. The combined discussion <b>of</b> <b>pledges,</b> hostages and sureties offers the reader insight into a triple method of security and its differences. Moreover, the close relationship between given pledges and distrained pledges is unravelled for the first time. Of further note is the comparative investigation into pledging. Therein, the reader is presented with how pledges are used in Welsh, Salic, Lombard, Visigothic, and Burgundian law. The objective is to offer the reader a view into the possibilities <b>of</b> <b>pledging</b> {{and to provide a}} framework against which the Irish evidence can be probed, which reveals how sophisticated and attentive to detail the Irish laws were. Finally, a translation of the primary source text Bretha im &# 7710;uillemu Gell (Judgements concerning Pledge-interests) is made available to the reader in the Appendix. </p...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} election pledges and their enactment in Ireland. Much previous research focused on countries where single‐party governments {{are the norm}} (the United Kingdom, Canada and Greece), and the presidential system of the United States with separation of powers. The present research draws on evidence from existing studies <b>of</b> <b>pledge</b> enactment in Ireland and the Netherlands. In addition, it adds new evidence on election pledges and their enactment {{in the most recent}} Irish government: the majority centre‐right coalition of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, 2002 – 2007. By adding this new evidence, we are able to make stronger inferences on the impact of coalition governance on the types <b>of</b> <b>pledges</b> made and rates <b>of</b> <b>pledge</b> enactment. We also study the impact of prominent mechanisms of coalition governance – government agreements and ministerial portfolio allocations – on the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>pledge</b> enactment. In addition, in an effort to move beyond existing research, we present evidence {{on the extent to which}} election pledges are featured in media reports during the election campaign...|$|R

This study provides the first comparative analysis that addresses this question with common definitions <b>of</b> <b>pledges</b> and fulfillment.

We find high levels <b>of</b> <b>pledge</b> fulfillment for most parties that enter the government executive, and substantially lower levels for parties that do not.

The degree to which governing parties share power affects pledge fulfillment, with parties in single-party executives, both with and without legislative majorities, having the highest fulfillment rates. Within coalition governments, the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>pledge</b> fulfillment depends on whether the party receives the chief executive post and whether another governing party made a similar pledge, {{but not on the}} ideological range of the coalition...|$|R

Compared with international banks, the proportion <b>of</b> inventory <b>pledge</b> loans in China is smaller and develops slowly. Therefore, the rapid development of Chinese modern service industry has been restricted to a particular extent, for example, the logistics and financial industries’ ability to promote growth in real economy has been restricted. During the inventory pledge loan process, the value <b>of</b> <b>pledges</b> changes with time and those with sufficiently high values reduce the credit risk of banks. One of the key risk management problems of banks is to determine a reasonably pledged loan-to-value ratio, a rate <b>of</b> <b>pledge</b> loans, and a pledge value.
