40|$|This {{research}} paper {{deals with the}} determination of total <b>chromium</b> (<b>total</b> <b>Cr),</b> Cr(III), and Cr(VI) in Kombolcha leather industrial wastewater and the surrounding (soil and lettuce plant) samples where the wastewater flows. The levels of total Cr, Cr(VI), and Cr(III) in wastewater, soil, and lettuce plant samples were determined by FAAS, UV/Vis spectrophotometer, and difference (Cr(VI) from total Cr), respectively. Among all samples taken, the maximum amounts of total Cr, Cr(III), and Cr(VI) were obtained at the discharging point and the minimum amounts of total Cr and Cr(III) were found downstream (400 m from the junction) of Kombolcha leather industrial wastewater. On the other hand, the minimum concentration of Cr(VI) was obtained in lettuce plant sample. The amounts of total Cr in all samples except soil sample were above the permissible limit as set by WHO/FAO. The concentrations of Cr(III) in all wastewater samples were above the permissible level, whereas the concentration of Cr(VI) in wastewater was above the permissible level except 400 m from the junction. The result showed that a remarkable elimination of total Cr and Cr species has not been achieved by this leather industry as its level was not much decreased when entered into the water systems. Therefore, effective treatment methods should {{be applied to the}} wastewater for the wellbeing of the surroundings...|$|E

The cement matrix of concrete was obtained by eliminating the aggregate components by means of disaggregation and was ground until it could pass through a 63 -μm-sieve. In addition, samples of bagged commercial cements were considered. Metal determination was obtained by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy after strong acid dissolution (HCl–HNO 3). Total Cr(VI) determination was obtained after mild acid attack (HCl) and analysed by UV–Vis spectrophotometry. Analytical data values obtained indicate that the highest concentrations of metals were found in concrete and in bagged cement samples characterized by high Fe concentration. High Cr(VI) concentrations both in the cement matrix of concrete and in cement samples were found in total Cr-rich samples. Cr(VI) concentrations were about 20 – 30 % of <b>total</b> <b>Cr.</b> The data obtained indicate that secondary raw materials and industrial by-product powders utilized in the modern cement industry may significantly increase Cr(VI) in concrete...|$|R

To assess {{the efficacy of the}} treatment, the leachability of toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) <b>total</b> <b>chromium</b> (<b>Cr)</b> from all treated samples was determined for curing periods up to 16 months. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analyses were also performed to evaluate the Cr 6 + concentration in the selected samples. The combination treatment of ferrous sulfate and the encapsulation of the treated COPR into asphalt reduced the TCLP <b>total</b> <b>Cr</b> concentration to lower than the regulatory limit of 5 mg/L for Cr contaminated soils, after 16 months. However, the Cr concentrations were still higher than the universal treatment standards (UTS) of 0. 6 mg/L for hazardous waste. On the other hand, treatment with ferrous sulfate alone or the encapsulation of the COPR in asphalt failed to meet the TCLP <b>total</b> <b>Cr</b> concentration of 5 mg/L, after 16 months.

Liver and muscle tissue was analyzed from 41 samples of B. falcatus collected during the dry season in 2013 from the Teles Pires River basin. Considering that bioaccumulation is the progressive increase in the amount of a substance in an organism or part of an organism, copper bioaccumulation in liver samples from B. falcatus was verified. Cr and Cu concentrations were higher in the liver than in the muscle tissue of fish collected in all rivers. The highest concentrations of Cr in the liver were observed in fish collected from the Teles Pires River (1. 87 μg∙g- 1) and the Celeste River (1. 06 μg∙g- 1).

A limited number of samples was analysed with INAA (Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis) as a reference method. The ICP-MS results were compared with INAA and the results of XRF-XEPOS with those of INAA and/or ICP-MS.

During the separation process, Cr(VI) was selectively adsorbed onto the Chromabond NH 2 column. The retained Cr(VI) was subsequently eluted with two column volumes of 2 M HNO 3 and diluted to a final volume of 10 mL. After separation, the Cr(VI) was quantified by DRC-ICP-MS, using O 2 as the reactive gas, to alleviate polyatomic ion interference. An O 2 gas flow rate of 0. 85 ml/min and a high-pass rejection parameter q (Rpq) = 0. 5, provided the best compromise signal-to-noise ratio. The method was validated through determining the recovery in milk samples spiked with Cr(VI). The recoveries were quantitative and ranged from 96. 4 to 99. 2 %. A whole milk powder reference material (NIST SRM 8435) {{was used to evaluate}} the accuracy of the <b>total</b> <b>Cr</b> quantification method. The observed value showed concordance with the certified value. The limits of detection (LOD) were 0. 091 and 0. 085 µg/L for <b>total</b> <b>Cr</b> and Cr(VI), respectively. These findings are important for the determination of maximum residue levels (MRLs) of Cr(VI) in dairy products...|$|R

40|$|For {{the years}} 1987 - 1990 160 {{individual}} samples of manual metal arc stainless steel (MMA/SS) welding fumes from the breathing zone of welders in four industrial plants were collected. Concentrations of soluble and insoluble chromium (Cr) III and Cr VI compounds {{as well as}} of some other welding fume elements (Fe, Mn, Ni, F) were determined. Concentration of welding fumes in the breathing zone ranged from 0. 2 to 23. 4 mg/m 3. <b>Total</b> <b>Cr</b> amounted to 0. 005 - 0. 991 mg/m 3 (including 0. 005 - 0. 842 mg/m 3 <b>Cr</b> VI). <b>Total</b> <b>Cr</b> content of fumes varied from 0. 1 to 7. 4 %. The distribution of particular Cr compounds was: 52. 6 % soluble Cr (including 50. 7 % Cr VI), 65. 5 % <b>total</b> <b>Cr</b> VI, and 11. 4 % insoluble Cr VI. The results obtained indicate that MMA/SS welding is a process that could be highly hazardous to human health. Evaluation of occupational exposure has shown that MMA/SS welders may exceed the admissible concentrations of soluble and insoluble Cr VI forms {{as well as of}} Mn and Ni. In the plants investigated the sum of the ratios of concentrations of particular welding fumes in the breathing zone of welders exceeded corresponding maximum allowable concentration values by 24 times (including 17 times for <b>total</b> <b>Cr</b> VI). Due to the variety and changeability of particular parameters occurring in the working environment, the composition of MMA/SS welding fumes (in the welder's breathing zone) is so variable that {{it is not possible to}} assess the exposure by means of one universal exposure indicator (maximum additive hygienic limit value). The evaluation should be based on the results of measurements of concentrations of particular elements in welding fumes...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, the {{condition}} of water pollution in Malaysia is becoming more serious because of the water quality is declining due to the anthropogenic activity that was carried out. Sungai Nyior has been chosen for this study of water quality which located in Balok Baru, Kuantan, Pahang with length and wide are 11. 3 km and 20 m respectively. The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate the characteristics of current water quality in the study area based on National Water Quality Standard (NWQS) and Water Quality Index (WQI), Malaysia, to identify the possible factors or sources that influences the water quality of the river system and to make an appropriate suggestion for effective management of the water resources. To achieve the objectives, three times of water samples were collected monthly from September to November 2016. Physical, chemical and biological parameters were analyzed using standard methods. The WQI was calculated based on the concentration of pH, total suspended solid (TSS), ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 -N), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and dissolved oxygen (DO). Other parameters that were analyse in this study were turbidity, temperature, electrical conductivity (EC), total hardness, selected heavy metal which are cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu) and <b>chromium</b> (<b>Cr),</b> <b>total</b> coliform and E. coli,. Result from the study showed the values of WQI at each station were in the range 51. 9 - 76. 5 that in the Class III. The WQI score value at Station 1, 2 and 3 were 54. 20, 56. 19, and 54. 21 respectively. The status of this river was in polluted condition. In NWQS, the Sungai Nyior is classified under Class IV. The main factor of anthropogenic activities that influences the degradation of water quality was sewerage and drainage in a residential area, construction activities, livestock, agricultural and forested that near the river.

The physical and ionic parameters were mostly found within the WHO (Guidelines for drinking-water quality, 3 rd edn, Geneva 2004) standard for drinking water. The trace metals except Cu at some sites recorded values above the WHO (Guidelines for drinking-water quality, 3 rd edn, Geneva 2004) standard for drinking water. This shows that the river water is not entirely fit for drinking. Mean values of physico-chemical parameters were mostly found to be high in the dry season {{as compared to the}} wet season. Cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were employed to evaluate the water quality and the interrelationship between variables. CA grouped the physico-chemical parameters into three groups (physical/minor ions, major ions and trace elements). Correlation analysis showed that physico-chemical parameters do not vary much in terms of the sampling sites. Thus, based on obtained information, it is possible to design a future, desirable sampling strategy, which could reduce the number of sampling stations and associated costs for effective river water quality management. Results showed that four principal components (industrial effect, domestic factor, natural source and agricultural effect) accounted for 65.59  % of the total variance among the water quality parameters. PCA also identified sampling sites 69 R, 63 R, 51 M, 87 L, 35 L, 74 L and 84 L as polluted with metals. Therefore, water quality monitoring and control of release of industrial and anthropogenic wastes into the river are strongly needed.|$|R

40|$|Regeneration {{of strong}} base anion {{exchange}} (SBA-IX) resin produces concentrated and hazardous brine. One alternative regenerant and two brine treatment options were investigated {{to reduce the}} hazardous characteristics of the brine. These included replacing sodium chloride with sodium bicarbonate as regenerant; using ferrous sulfate (FeSO 4) to reduce/coagulate hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) in the brine; and applying weak base anion exchange (WBA-IX) resin and chemical reductive media (CRM) to adsorb/reduce Cr(VI). It was found that bicarbonate was as effective as chloride in regenerating chromium-saturated resins, and the affinity of bicarbonate-form resin for chromium {{was similar to that}} of chloride-form. It was observed that ferrous sulfate applied at doses close to the stoichiometric ratio achieved near complete removal of <b>total</b> <b>Cr</b> from SBA-IX brine.

The samples were taken as industrial exhaust directly by the outlet and as airborne sample in the environment with distances between some hundred meters and 2 km from the industrial factory. Wherefore two methods of sampling, sample pre-treatment and mass spectrometric measurement were developed and applied. With respect to different sampling duration different volumes of air were sampled and analysed. For the determination of Cr(VI) sampling in impingers (filled with carbonate-buffer) was used. A procedure of selective complex forming and extraction was developed and measured by double focussing sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-SFMS). For {{the determination of the}} <b>total</b> <b>chromium</b> concentration as well as of 11 metals sampling was done by using quartz-filters. After microwave digestion in the medium of aqua regia the samples were analysed by quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-QMS). The maximum concentration of Cr(VI) -species in emission samples was determined as 180 ng/m 3 air which is about 2 % of <b>total</b> <b>Cr.</b> The lowest concentration of Cr(VI) -species in immission was determined as 0. 5 ng/m 3 air...|$|R
