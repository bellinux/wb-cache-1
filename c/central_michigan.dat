5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, US27 was shifted {{to run through}} St. Louis instead of Alma, and the former route was renumbered US27A. US127 was realigned near Mason in the mid-1940s, and a {{business}} loop was created out of the former routing there. A similar bypass of Jackson in the late 1950s also spawned a business loop. In the early 1960s, a new expressway (later freeway) for US27 through <b>Central</b> <b>Michigan</b> {{led to the creation}} of several business loops. Other bypasses opened in the 1980s and 1990s and created the last two business loops. The 2002 extension of US127 to replace US27 also led to the redesignation of business loops to their current monikers.|$|E
5|$|M-61 {{starts in}} eastern Osceola County south of Marion at an {{intersection}} with M-115. It runs eastward and meets M-66 before crossing into Clare County. The highway {{runs along the}} boundary between the regions of Northern and <b>Central</b> <b>Michigan</b> through forest land and crosses the Muskegon River en route to Harrison. There it follows Main Street into town to an intersection with 1st Street near Budd Lake. M-61 turns south at the intersection and joins the business loop of US127 (Bus. US127) through town. Bus. US127/M-61 follows Clare Avenue south of the city to exit170 on the US127 freeway. The business loop ends, and M-61 turns east along Gladwin Road.|$|E
5|$|North of Alma, US127 turns due north {{again and}} crosses into Isabella County.
