50|$|Corbett's {{electrostatic}} machine {{consists of}} a 0.5 in wooden base platform sitting on a 2 in frame, forming a box. The wooden platform is about 12 in wide and about 9 in deep. To {{one side of the}} wooden platform is mounted a small axle on pivots, which holds a rotating glass jar cylinder {{about the size of a}} Mason jar. This glass jar is attached to a <b>crank</b> <b>wheel</b> of about 5 in with a leather belt. The <b>crank</b> <b>wheel</b> can be turned by hand. The wooden platform also contains a Leyden jar-style battery in one corner, standing some 9 in high. The Leyden jar is a glass receptacle with a metal rod in the center, covered by a metal ball on top which collects and releases a high voltage electrical charge.|$|E
50|$|The Digital Bolex {{camera was}} the second camera to utilize Adobe's CinemaDNG open RAW file format after the Swedish-made Ikonoskop which debuted in 2008. Both cameras utilize a Kodak-designed CCD sensor. The Digital Bolex D16 shoots raw still frames per second instead of a {{traditional}} video stream. In addition to its raw capabilities, the camera is notable for its Super 16mm sized sensor, allowing the usage of vintage 16mm lenses with no crop, and its unique <b>crank</b> <b>wheel</b> encoder. The Digital Bolex is the only digital cinema camera with a native C mount, {{a nod to the}} original Bolex 16mm film cameras.|$|E
50|$|The <b>crank</b> <b>wheel</b> of Corbett's {{electrostatic}} {{machine was}} turned by an operator using the knob handle; the glass cylinder was rotated by an attached belt. The glass jar rubbed against a layered silk cloth pad or a textile cloth pad, developing a high voltage positive electrical charge. This static electricity charge {{was taken off}} the glass cylinder through a small metal rake and transferred by wire to the Leyden jar storage battery for later use (see close-up illustration). The high voltage stored electrostatic charge kept in the Leyden jar was on the metal ball on top of the high voltage storage battery. It would produce a spark visible to the eye when the set of small metal globes attached to the battery were brought close enough to each other as a test experiment in a discharge.|$|E
50|$|The model {{uses the}} {{standard}} chassis with front-mounted boiler and mid-mounted oscillating engine, but the rear body carries a turntable ladder, complete with exposed <b>cranking</b> <b>wheels.</b> The model is painted bright red with polished chromework, and {{is similar in}} appearance to fire engines produced by Leyland in the 1920s.|$|R

50|$|This is {{the default}} Al Grippo code {{that you can}} load onto your MS-II board. The code has (multiple) 12x12 fuel and spark tables, stepper IAC control, PWM idle valve control, several user-configurable spare ports (for things like boost control, water injection, fan control, etc.), self-tuning {{functions}} (Automatic Mixture Control - AMC), and fuel control to 1 µs (100 times more resolution than MegaSquirt-I). MS-II can control distributors or EDIS ignitions and decode many standard toothed <b>crank</b> <b>wheels.</b> Additional features includes X-Tau transient enrichment compensation (acceleration enrichment), nitrous control with fuel and spark adjustments, enhanced closed-loop mixture control w/ wide band sensor AFR targeting, two types of rev-limiting, MAP/MAF/alpha-N fuel control, injector test mode, flex fuel (gasoline/E85) with appropriate sensor, and many more.|$|R
5000|$|The A588 is the SOHC version {{found in}} most post 2001 Chrysler products. The ECB SOHC version, found in earlier models, is {{identical}} except for the crank trigger wheel. When equipped with the newer <b>crank</b> <b>wheel</b> for the new NGC engine computer, the A588 version cannot be directly transplanted into a vehicle originally equipped with the earlier style engine using an SBEC (Single Board Engine Controller). Output is [...] SAE (98 kW) at 5600 rpm with 130 lb·ft (177 N·m) of torque at 4600 rpm. It has an aluminum SOHC cylinder head. It uses a reinforced plastic intake manifold (although {{a few of the}} 1995 and 1996 engines received an aluminum intake manifold due to a shortage of the plastic parts). They were painted black, but it's easy to see the casting marks and prints on the manifold. The aluminum version is prized among enthusiasts as it's easy to port and polish for improved airflow characteristics.|$|E
50|$|De Gekroonde Poelenburg is a Dutch paltrok mill - {{a wooden}} mill {{supported}} {{on a short}} central post and a ring of wooden rollers on a low brick base and designed specifically for sawing wood. The mill body is boarded, however the sawing floor is open on three sides with only the windward facing side and the side roofs giving protection against the weather. The entire mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. On the front is a stage, 3.0 m above ground for setting the sails. The sails are common sails with a span of 20.3 m. They are carried on a cast iron windshaft cast by foundry De Prins van Oranje as number 0430 in 1866. The brake wheel with 66 cogs on the wind shaft drives the <b>crank</b> <b>wheel</b> with 26 radial cogs on the horizontal crank shaft. There is no upright shaft. The crank shaft has three crank pins. Connecting rods from the crank pins drive the three frame saws. Reciprocating lever bars also drive the pawl and ratchet mechanisms which in turn drive the winches and the feeding mechanism of the log carriages through rack and pinion mechanisms. The winches {{can be used with}} the log hoist to lift logs from the water onto the sawing platform and to pull the log carriages back to their starting position.|$|E

The mill body is boarded, however the sawing floor is open on three sides with only the windward facing side and the side roofs giving protection against the weather. The entire mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. On the front is a stage, 2.80 m above ground for setting the sails. The sails are common sails with a span of 20 m. They are carried on a cast iron windshaft of unknown manufacturer. The brake wheel with 75 cogs drives the <b>crank</b> <b>wheel</b> with 33 radial cogs on the horizontal crank shaft. There is no upright shaft. The crank shaft has four crank pins to drive four sawing frames, one more than common in Dutch wind-sawmills. The mill is also a bit wider than common to accommodate the extra sawing frame. The rearmost sawing frame was later removed and replaced by a reciprocating weight to keep the mechanism balanced. Connecting rods from the crank pins drive the frame saws.

5000|$|In 1807 Robert Fulton {{placed on}} the Hudson River the {{steamboat}} North River (aka Clermont) which was powered by a low pressure Boulton and Watt steam engine. The heavy and inherently inefficient engine required {{an increase in the}} size, and hence the weight, of the steam cylinder for an increase in power. Mounting the cylinder vertically, Fulton [...] "invented" [...] a complex series of levers and cranks to transmit the power of the piston to each paddle <b>wheel</b> <b>crank.</b> Two paddle <b>wheels,</b> one on each side, were mounted midway between the bow and the stern. On the western rivers, Fulton's design was the standard for steamboats until the Enterprise which was designed by French.|$|R
60|$|Rope-ends, life-buoys, {{and other}} things were flung over the side; oars were plunged; boats darted forward; fifty efforts at rescue were made in as many seconds, for there was wealth of aid at hand, and in a wonderfully brief space of time the brown boy was {{restored}} to his grateful friends, while Robin, enveloped in a suit of dry clothes much too large for him, was seated with his friend the engineer down among the great <b>cranks,</b> and <b>wheels,</b> and levers, of the regions below.|$|R
50|$|Typically {{the bearing}} boxes were {{designed}} to allow the axle to slide some either way, and the <b>wheel</b> <b>cranks</b> and the coupling rods were modified to accommodate this extra range of motion. Spring centering might also be provided to keep the wheels on such axles from hunting side to side.|$|R
50|$|In cycling, cadence (or {{pedalling}} rate) is {{the number}} of revolutions of the crank per minute; this is the rate at which a cyclist is pedalling/turning the pedals. Cadence is directly proportional to wheel speed, but is a distinct measurement and changes with gearing—which determines the ratio of <b>crank</b> rpm to <b>wheel</b> rpm.|$|R
2500|$|The {{following}} table {{provides some}} {{comparison of the}} various methods of measuring gears (the particular numbers are for bicycles with 170mm <b>cranks,</b> 700C <b>wheels,</b> and 25mm tyres). Speeds for several cadences in revolutions per minute are also given. [...] On each row the relative values for gear inches, metres of development, gain ratio, and speed {{are more or less}} correct, while the front/rear values are the nearest approximation which can be made using typical chainring and cogset sizes.

50|$|Meanwhile, Patrick Miller of Dalswinton, near Dumfries, Scotland, had {{developed}} double-hulled boats propelled by manually <b>cranked</b> paddle <b>wheels</b> placed between the hulls, even attempting to interest various European governments {{in a giant}} warship version, 246 ft long. Miller sent King Gustav III of Sweden an actual small-scale version, 100 ft long, called Experiment. Miller then engaged engineer William Symington to build his patent steam engine that drove a stern-mounted paddle wheel in a boat in 1785. The boat was successfully tried out on Dalswinton Loch in 1788 and {{was followed by a}} larger steamboat the next year. Miller then abandoned the project.|$|R

60|$|Then {{there was}} the hissing of a train, which drew up almost silently upon the wet rails, and the milk was rapidly swung can by can into the truck. The light of the engine flashed for a second upon Tess Durbeyfield's figure, {{motionless}} under the great holly tree. No object could have looked more foreign to the gleaming <b>cranks</b> and <b>wheels</b> than this unsophisticated girl, with the round bare arms, the rainy face and hair, the suspended attitude of a friendly leopard at pause, the print gown of no date or fashion, and the cotton bonnet drooping on her brow.|$|R
5000|$|Some more {{sophisticated}} models {{are able to}} measure the rider's power in terms of watts.

(See Team Strawberry for the early development and testing stages of this technology.) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{optimize}} training {{relating to}} the coordinative skills of athletes, a special cycle ergometer ARES with decoupled cranks was developed. The system {{is equipped with a}} measurement system to measure radial and tangential forces on the pedals, additionally to the acquisition of angle velocities of the two <b>crank</b> <b>wheels.</b> Due to the decoupled cranks, every leg performs its own revolution, and has to be active even at the pulling phase, without direct support of the opposite legs downstroke. To explore the unique possibilities of ARES, 4 subjects were tested on the ergometer in a first trial. After a short acclimatization phase to get familiar with the characteristics of the bike, the following tests were performed: (1) normal biking at different numbers of revolution with the challenge to keep a 180 ° phase angle, and (2) special coordination tasks: a) biking with 0 ° phase angle, b) Stop-and-go procedures with re-synchronization of the movement, c) counter-movement with both legs moving into opposite direction, and d) a lower half circle swing. During the exercises, forces on the pedals, the crank positions and current cadence were acquired. Out of this data, torque, power, angle velocities and an efficiency parameter were determined for the left and right leg. Variations in cadence, forces and torque as a function of pedal angle are clearly visible. A dependency on number of revolutions seems to be evident, caused by the higher coordinative challenge at high velocities...|$|R
50|$|The {{solution}} is to separate the <b>crank</b> from the <b>wheels,</b> firstly allowing for a reasonable piston stroke and crank radius without requiring larger than desired driving wheels, and secondly allowing for reduction in rotational speed via gearing. Such a locomotive is a geared locomotive. Most were and are still single speed, but some did employ a variable-ratio gearbox and multiple ratios.|$|R

5000|$|Schuco 'Studio' {{cars had}} a {{starting}} <b>crank,</b> removable <b>wheels,</b> varied gearing and {{rack and pinion}} steering. Cars came with miniature tool kits. Probably because the Schuco name ended in [...] "o", this started a tradition of naming vehicle lines and sets with a somewhat male, Italian-sounding [...] "o" [...] at the end. Thus, Studio, Piccolo, and Varianto. One notable Studio car was the Luigi Fagioli Auto Union Avus 'Streamline', built in 1937, which came in a detailed box, complete with tools.

40|$|What is a person? The {{answer to}} this {{foundational}} question may seem intuitive at the first glance. Many would respond, without much thought, {{that a person is}} a human being. However, proponents of empirical functionalist philosophy contend that personhood is based on the ability to perform certain actions in actual, not potential, form. They would therefore claim that some members of species homo sapiens may not actually be persons (Singer, 1985). To understand when personhood begins, it is first necessary to understand what a person is. This paper will apply the Aristotelian concepts of substance and nature to define person, and then argue for the ontological personalist view that personhood begins at conception (Palazzani, 1994). Substance is a philosophical word that denotes the intrinsic quality of some objects that makes them {{more than the sum of}} their parts. Philosophers contrast substances with “property things, ” which are defined by their parts (Sullivan, 2003, p. 19). A Trek 1000 SL road bike is an example of a property thing. If someone were to exchange the handlebars, <b>cranks,</b> <b>wheels,</b> and seat for lighter carbon fiber parts, it would no longer be a Trek 1000. This bike is defined by its parts. However, this is not the case for a human being. Removing the arm, leg, and kidney of a certain human named Joe and replacing them with other functioning parts from different individuals does not change Joe’s substance (Sullivan, 2003). Joe is still Joe. Joe’s essence does not change if his component parts change. Proponents of ontological personalism call this “continuity of existence ” (Young, 1994, p. 3). Substance differentiates between humans and property things, but it still does not answer the question “Are all humans persons? ” Substance, as defined above, also includes pet dogs, laboratory mice, and many other entities that have continuity of existence.

On seeing a steam-carriage model made by the engineer William Symington (or on the suggestion of Symington's friend James Taylor), he got Symington to build his patent steam engine with its drive into a twin-hulled pleasure boat. This was successfully tried out on Dalswinton Loch near Miller's house on 14 October 1788. The next year a larger engine was fitted to a 60 ft long twin-hull paddle boat and tried on the Forth and Clyde Canal. After initial problems of paddle wheels breaking up on 2 December, the vessel travelled some distance along the canal on 26 December and 27 December 1789. Miller abandoned the project due to the rising expenses of the venture.|$|R
