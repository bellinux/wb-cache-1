40|$|Gem opals from Wegel Tena, Wollo Province, Ethiopia, {{occur in}} Oligocene rhyolitic ignimbrites. They display a unique geochemistry, with some samples {{yielding}} the highest Ba concentrations ever recorded. They are generally much richer in <b>chemical</b> <b>impurities</b> than opals from other localities. For example, the sum Al+Fe or the sum Na+Mg+Ca+K+Ba are often higher. These geochemical features make them easy to distinguish from other opals worldwide. We observed strong geochemical variations and some good positive correlations in our samples, such as Al+Fe vs. Na+Mg+Ca+K+Ba, Al vs Ca, or Ba vs Ca. This {{shows that the}} crystallography of opal has controlled, at least in part, the incorporation of <b>chemical</b> <b>impurities,</b> although opal is not well-crystallized. In addition, the multimodal distributions of several <b>chemical</b> <b>impurities</b> (e. g.

In addition, opals from Wegel Tena contain numerous well-preserved microscopic plant fossils. Moreover, their host rock exhibits features typical of pedogenesis (abundant clays, desiccation cracks, and grain size sorting). We propose that the opals at Wegel Tena formed during the Oligocene period when volcanic emissions stopped for a time long enough to allow weathering of ingimbrites and therefore liberation of silica. This accompanied the formation of soil and development of plant life, and some plants were trapped in opal...|$|R

Chlorogallium phthalocyanine (GaPc-Cl), shown by previous research in this group to have exceptional photoelectrochemical properties and sensitivity to chemical dopants such as oxygen and hydrogen, is suspected {{to be influenced by}} growth conditions and subsequent exposure to ambient conditions. GaPc-Cl films were grown on interdigitated array microcircuits in an ultra high vacuum chamber and several solid state parameters (in vacuum) were measured. This yielded information concerning: structural trap concentration; <b>chemical</b> <b>impurity</b> concentration and energetic levels; trap depths; ohmic or space charge limited current behavior; quantum efficiencies; and, photocurrent sensitivity to changes in illumination intensity. Films with higher <b>chemical</b> <b>impurity</b> concentrations had larger rise and decay times; high dark currents and low dark activation energies; larger photoactivation energies; a poor contrast of photo-to-dark current; extended ohmic regions in dark current-voltage curves; enhanced absorbed light quantum efficiencies; and low sensitivity of photocurrent to changes in light intensity. Chemical dopants (O₂, NH₃, NO₂ and TCNQ) were then chemisorbed on the films and uptake curves were obtained by monitoring dark and/or photocurrent responses. Solid state measurements were repeated for comparison and contrast to the native state. O₂ and NH₃ cause irreversible dark and photocurrent decreases followed by reversible dark and photocurrent increases. TCNQ and NO₂ caused immediate reversible photo and dark current increases. Solid state parameters varied depending on whether the dopant was surface-bound (TCNQ), or could intercalate into the bulk (O₂, NH₃ and NO₂). XPS and UPS experiments were conducted on native GaPc-Cl or TCNQ films and bilayers of these two compounds. UPS established HOMO levels for GaPc-Cl and TCNQ and substantiated feasibility of GaPc-Cl oxidation; however, no useful XPS/UPS information was obtained for reactions between GaPc-Cl and TCNQ primarily because of overlapping spectral regions. XPS quantitation of TCNQ peak areas established identities of carbon atoms responsible for them. TCNQ deposition on various work function metals demonstrated the identity of TCNQ carbons susceptible to reduction...|$|E

The shells contain a thin outer, nanocrystalline primary layer, which is followed by an inner, much softer, secondary layer composed of inorganic/organic fibre composite material. We observed significant chemical and structural inhomogeneities within the shells. The calcite A 1 g Raman mode was slightly reduced from 1084 cm- 1 at the hinge (lock) down to 1083. 5 cm- 1 towards the tip. This {{is accompanied by a}} variation of some <b>chemical</b> <b>impurity</b> concentrations (e. g. Mg, Sr). A strong decrease in microhardness and distinct changes in chemical composition from the primary or the outermost part of the secondary layer towards the innermost portion of the secondary shell layer can be observed.

Uniaxial compression tests were done both on the Dye 3 and GRIP ice core samples from Greenland. The stress axis is inclined 45 degree from core axis in order to have information on horizontal shear deformation behavior of an ice sheet. The results were analyzed by using an enhancement factor, E. C-axis orientation fabric is a dominant factor for E values and can be estimated from vertical compression strain (N. AZUMA and A. HIGASHI, 1985) if preferred orientation is developed by crystal rotation process without recrystalization. E values from Dye 3 and GRIP samples were plotted with normalized depth (=depth/ice thickness), which is a measure of vertical compression strain. Down to a depth around 60 % of ice thickness, the E value stays constant around l, and increases below that depth as expected from the single maximum fabric in deeper places. Below a depth around 70 % of ice thickness, E exceeds about 10 and E of GRIP ice samples is higher than that of Dye 3 samples in general.

The simplest and most established method for preparing α-TCP is the solid state reaction of monetite (CaHPO 4) and calcium carbonate at high temperatures, followed by quenching. In this study, {{the effect of the}} chemical composition of reagents used in the synthesis of α-TCP on the local structure of the final product is reported and findings previously reported pertaining to the phase composition and stability are also corroborated. Chemical impurities in the monetite reagents were identified and could be correlated to the calcium phosphate products formed; magnesium impurities favoured the formation of β-TCP, whereas single phase α-TCP was favoured when magnesium levels were low. Monetite synthesised in-house exhibited a high level of chemical purity; when this source was used to produce an α-TCP sample, the α-polymorph could be obtained by both quenching and by cooling to room temperature in the furnace at rates between 1 and 10 °C/min, thereby simplifying the synthesis process.
