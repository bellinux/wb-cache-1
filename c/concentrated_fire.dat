5|$|Although {{built in}} {{response}} to Gloire, the Warriors had a very different operational concept from the French ship, which was meant to replace wooden ships of the line. The Warriors were designed by Watts as 40-gun armoured frigates and were not intended {{to stand in the}} line of battle, as the Admiralty was uncertain about their ability to withstand <b>concentrated</b> <b>fire</b> from wooden two- and three-deck ships of the line. Unlike Gloire, they were planned to be fast enough to force battle on a fleeing enemy and to control the range at which a battle was fought to their own advantage. In contrast to Gloires square profile, Warrior has a clipper bow, but she is twice as long as a typical clipper ship.|$|E
5|$|In late May, the 6th Machine Gun Battalion was {{deployed}} {{to support the}} defensive operations in the Chateau–Thierry Sector. During this time they were employed as a complete unit {{in order to provide}} <b>concentrated</b> <b>fire</b> support at key points along the Allied line. The 77th and 81st Companies were assigned to the right flank while the 15th and 23rd Companies were assigned to the left. Their job was to lay down covering and harassing fire during both defensive and offensive operations. They also assisted the 5th and 6th Marine Regiments in their respective drives through Belleau Wood. On 10 June, the battalion's commanding officer, Major Cole, was mortally wounded and command temporarily passed to Captain Harlan E. Major. Captain George H. Osterhout took over on 11 June; however, he remained in command only until 21 June, when Major Littleton Waller officially took over.|$|E
5|$|Princess Royal {{served in}} the Battle of Heligoland Bight {{a month after the}} war began and then was sent to the Caribbean to prevent the German East Asia Squadron from using the Panama Canal. After the East Asia Squadron was sunk at the Battle of the Falkland Islands by the two Invincible-class battlecruisers, Princess Royal rejoined the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. During the Battle of Dogger Bank she scored only a few hits, {{although}} one directly crippled the German armoured cruiser , which allowed the enemy vessel to be caught and sunk by the <b>concentrated</b> <b>fire</b> of the British battlecruisers. Shortly afterwards Princess Royal became the flagship of the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, under the command of Rear Admiral Osmond Brock. She was moderately damaged during the Battle of Jutland and required {{a month and a half}} of repairs. Both ships spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols in the North Sea, although they did provide distant cover during the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1917. In 1920 they were both put into reserve and were sold for scrap a few years later under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.|$|E

5|$|For {{extraordinary}} heroism {{while serving}} as a Leader of a Machine-Gun Section, Company C, 1st Battalion, 27th Marines, 5th Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, 19 February 1945. Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation shortly after landing when his company's advance was held up by the <b>concentrated</b> <b>fire</b> of a heavily fortified Japanese blockhouse, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE boldly defied the smashing bombardment of heavy caliber fire to work {{his way around the}} flank and up to a position directly on top of the blockhouse and then, attacking with grenades and demolitions, single handedly destroyed the entire hostile strong point and its defending garrison. Consistently daring and aggressive as he fought his way over the battle-torn beach and up the sloping, gun-studded terraces toward Airfield Number 1, he repeatedly exposed himself to the blasting fury of exploding shells and later in the day coolly proceeded to the aid of a friendly tank which had been trapped in an enemy mine field under intense mortar and artillery barrages, skillfully guiding the heavy vehicle over the hazardous terrain to safety, despite the overwhelming volume of hostile fire. In the forefront of the assault at all times, he pushed forward with dauntless courage and iron determination until, moving upon the edge of the airfield, he fell, instantly killed by a bursting mortar shell. Stouthearted and indomitable, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE, by his intrepid initiative, outstanding skill, and valiant spirit of self-sacrifice {{in the face of the}} fanatic opposition, contributed materially to the advance of his company during the early critical period of the assault, and his unwavering devotion to duty throughout the bitter conflict was an inspiration to his comrades and reflects the highest credit upon Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the attack}} on Pearl Harbor, Hamlett was {{recruited}} to be corps artillery executive for II Corps. In 1942 he landed with the 1st Infantry Division on Arzew Beach near Oran, Morocco during the Allied invasion of North Africa. Drawing on his experience as an instructor at Fort Sill, he helped reorganize the previously ineffective corps artillery, helping mold it into a decisive arm. It was particularly noted {{for its ability to}} mass <b>concentrated</b> <b>fire</b> at the Battle of El Guettar.|$|E
25|$|Although {{possessing}} significant naval {{superiority over}} the British, {{over the next}} two weeks the excessively cautious Saltonstall dawdled despite repeated requests by General Lovell that he attack Mowatt's position {{at the entrance to the}} harbor. Instead he largely maneuvered the American fleet around the mouth of the Penobscot River beyond the range of the British guns with only occasional ineffective attempts to engage the British. As long as the British warships continued to hold the harbor they were able to pin down the American forces on the ground with <b>concentrated</b> <b>fire</b> and prevent them from taking Fort George.|$|E

25|$|Just after 6 o'clock Cyane got on {{the port}} bow of Constitution, while Levant {{got on the}} port quarter. Cyane and Levant {{exchanged}} a series of broadsides with Constitution for about half an hour, but Stewart soon outmaneuvered both of them. After Levant drew off for repairs, he <b>concentrated</b> <b>fire</b> on Cyane. During this time, out of her crew of 145 men and 26 boys, Cyane had six killed and 13 wounded. She also took on five feet of water in her hold and had so much damage to her masts and rigging that she became unmanageable and had to soon strike her colors.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the terrain}} favored the French {{on the west}} flank, Lagrange {{launched}} an attack on that side. Without proper artillery support, the French infantry were stopped and thrown back by the <b>concentrated</b> <b>fire</b> of 24 Russian guns. Numerous French Guard field pieces, slowed by the mud, soon appeared and provided a rallying point for Lagrange's men. After taking a detour, Doumerc's horsemen appeared at Fromentières on the highway west of Champaubert. When Olsufiev received reports that the road east to Châlons was also blocked, he resolved to cut his way out in that direction. The Russian commander directed Prince Konstantin Markovich Poltoratsky with the Apsheron and Nacheburg Infantry Regiments and nine guns to hold Champaubert, while he attacked east toward Étoges with {{the bulk of his}} troops. Olsufiev's breakout attempt failed.|$|E
25|$|Japanese {{losses in}} Burma and India in 1944 had been catastrophic. They were made up with drafts of conscripts, {{many of whom}} were not of the best {{physical}} categories. Kimura's staff decreed that their divisions in Burma should have a strength of 10,000 (compared with their paper establishment of nearer 25,000), but most divisions mustered barely half this reduced strength. Furthermore, they lacked anti-tank weapons. To face massed Allied armour, they would be forced to deploy their field artillery in the front line, which would affect their ability to give <b>concentrated</b> <b>fire</b> support to the infantry. Expedients such as lunge mines (an explosive charge {{on the end of a}} long pole), or suicide attacks by men wearing explosive charges, were not effective if the enemy tanks were closely supported by infantry.|$|E

25|$|The 8th Division {{advanced}} towards Westhoek {{and took}} the Blue and Black lines relatively easily. The southern flank then became exposed to the <b>concentrated</b> <b>fire</b> of German machine-guns from Nonne Boschen and Glencorse Wood {{in the area to}} be taken by the 30th Division. The difficulties of the 30th Division further south were unknown to the 8th Division until just before the 25th Brigade was due to advance over Westhoek Ridge. Brigadier-General Coffin decided that {{it was too late to}} stop the attack and sent a company of the reserve battalion to fill the gap to the south, which was not enough to stop German enfilade fire, so the Brigade consolidated on the reverse slope and held the crest with Lewis-gun posts. Pockets of ground lost to German counter-attacks were regained by British counter-attacks. British artillery barrages made it impossible for German infantry advance further in this area.|$|E
25|$|The {{bombardment}} of Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip began on April 18, 1862. Porter had opined that {{two days of}} <b>concentrated</b> <b>fire</b> {{would be enough to}} reduce the forts, but after five days they seemed as strong as ever. The mortars were beginning to run low on ammunition. Farragut, who put little reliance on the mortars anyway, made the decision to bypass the forts on the night of April 24. The fleet successfully ran past the forts; the mortars were left behind, but they bombarded the forts during the passage in order to distract the enemy gunners. Once the fleet was above the forts, nothing significant stood between them and New Orleans; Farragut demanded the surrender of the city, and it fell to his fleet on April 29. The forts were still between him and Porter's mortar fleet, but when the latter again began to pummel Fort Jackson, its garrison mutinied and forced its surrender. Fort St. Philip had to follow suit. Surrender of the two forts was accepted by Commander Porter on April 28.|$|E

Though his regular regiments (the [...] "troupes de terre" [...] or [...] "metropolitans") were adept at such formal warfare, {{in the course of the}} campaign their ranks had been replenished by less professional militiamen, whose talents at forest warfare emphasised the individual: they tended to fire early and then drop to the ground to reload, thus reducing the effect of <b>concentrated</b> <b>fire</b> at close range.|$|E
