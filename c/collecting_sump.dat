Approximately 10 % of toner particles are left over the drum due to specific factors. This left out toner is cleaned by the unit to ensure the copy quality of the proceeding copies. This left out toner is called as waste toner and is <b>collected</b> in cleaner <b>sump.</b> If this waste toner {{is used in the}} photocopiers, the quality of the copier is reduced. The waste toner is mixed in proportion with Carbon Black Nano powder and original toner to get Hybrid Carbon Black Toner. The original toner is the toner prescribed for the photocopier by the manufacturer. By implementation of this technique, the cost of photocopy can be reduced {{and the quality of the}} photocopy can be increased...|$|R
40|$|An aero-engine {{bearing chamber}} is a {{structure}} {{that is used to}} contain and collect oil used in lubricating and cooling the bearings supporting the high-speed engine shafts. There are various bearings in an aero-engine. Within the bearing chambers, there are typically the bearings, rotating shafts, seals and gears (in some designs). The walls of the bearing chamber are stationary and there are vents and sumps to take out the oil, via an offtake pipe, and the sealing air. The oil <b>collected</b> via the <b>sump</b> and vents is recycled and used again in the loop. To prevent oil degradation and reduce chance of coking in the chamber, it is desired that all of the oil goes through the recycling loop, with no oil staying longer than necessary in the chamber. The sealing air is used to maintain a positive pressure to keep the oil within the chamber. The flow inside a bearing chamber is highly turbulent and consists of a rotating mixture of oil and air. A smaller amount of the oil, mostly as oil-droplets, exits at the vents and is separated from the air using de-aerators [1]. It is expected that by gravity, most of the oil <b>collects</b> at the <b>sump</b> and can be easily scavenged. This is provided the sump can be large enough. The geometry of a bearing chamber is, however, complex largely because of space limitations. It is very important that oil is not resident longer than necessary to prevent over-heating and therefore deterioration or coking. Experimental observations by Chandra & Simmons [2], have shown that bearing chambers with deep sumps perform better that those with shallow sumps. Since shallow sumps are inevitable, a number of innovative studies have been done to improve bearing chamber designs. The presence of air in the oil (e. g. as bubbles) reduces the efficiency of the scavenging pump. Other factors such as oil momentum and windage can take oil away from the off-take pipe potentially increasing oil residence volume. Chandra & Simmons [2] placed inserts such as grille cover, perforated plate, etc, on a side of the bearing wall and improvements in the residence volume were seen. In this work, we are looking at a detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of one of the inserts that performed well. This will aid understanding of the flow characteristics of using an insert to improve oil residence in a bearing chamber...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Oil and gas {{exploration}} {{conducted in}} the 1970 s left a legacy of abandoned test wells with sumps, containing drilling waste, in the Mackenzie Delta region of Canada’s Northwest Territories. One to {{two years after the}} test wells were decommissioned, a set of sites were seeded with non-native grasses and fertilized to test whether these treatments could accelerate vegetation recovery and prevent erosion. We sampled seeded and unseeded sumps and adjacent tundra vegetation in the Mackenzie Delta region three decades later to examine the impact of post-disturbance seeding treatments on site recovery. Plant species composition and environmental data were <b>collected</b> at 12 <b>sump</b> sites (6 seeded and fertilized and 6 unseeded and unfertilized) in lowland and upland tundra. Multivariate analyses using NMDS and perMANOVA indicated that in the lowlands, seeding and fertilization treatments had small but significant effects on plant species composition that differentiated seeded from unseeded sump caps. Plant communities on sump caps for all treatment types were significantly different from surrounding undisturbed tundra, even after more than 30 years of recovery. Seeded non-native grasses were found on both seeded and unseeded sumps, but not in the surrounding undisturbed tundra. Undisturbed tundra appears resistant to the spread of introduced agronomic grasses, but disturbed areas, such as sumps, provide areas of suitable habitat where non-native plants can persist.

40|$|The Y- 12 National Security Complex (Y- 12 Complex) is {{an active}} {{manufacturing}} and developmental engineering facility that {{is located on the}} U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Oak Ridge Reservation. Building 9201 - 2 {{was one of the first}} process buildings constructed at the Y- 12 Complex. Construction involved relocating and straightening of the Upper East Fork Poplar Creek (UEFPC) channel, adding large quantities of fill material to level areas along the creek, and pumping of concrete into sinkholes and solution cavities present within the limestone bedrock. Flow from a large natural spring designated as ''Big Spring'' on the original 1943 Stone & Webster Building 9201 - 2 Field Sketch FS 6003 was captured and directed to UEFPC through a drainpipe designated Outfall 51. The building was used from 1953 to 1955 for pilot plant operations for an industrial process that involved the use of large quantities of elemental mercury. Past operations at the Y- 12 Complex led to the release of mercury to the environment. Significant environmental media at the site were contaminated by accidental releases of mercury from the building process facilities piping and sumps associated with Y- 12 Complex mercury handling facilities. Releases to the soil surrounding the buildings have resulted in significant levels of mercury in these areas of contamination, which is ultimately transported to UEFPC, its streambed, and off-site. Bechtel Jacobs Company LLC (BJC) is the DOE-Oak Ridge Operations prime contractor responsible for conducting environmental restoration activities at the Y- 12 Complex. In order to mitigate the mercury being released to UEFPC, the Big Spring Water Treatment System will be designed and constructed as a Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act action. This facility will treat the combined flow from Big Spring feeding Outfall 51 and the inflow now being processed at the East End Mercury Treatment System (EEMTS). Both discharge to UEFPC adjacent to Bldg. 9201 - 2. The EEMTS treats mercury-contaminated groundwater that <b>collects</b> in <b>sumps</b> in the basement of Bldg. 9201 - 2. A pre-design study was performed to investigate the applicability of various treatment technologies for reducing mercury discharges at Outfall 51 in support of the design of the Big Spring Water Treatment System. This document evaluates the results of the pre-design study for selection of the mercury removal technology for the treatment system...|$|R
50|$|As liquid {{enters the}} {{landfill}} cell, it {{moves down the}} filter, passes through the pipe network, and rests in the sump. As collection systems are planned, the number, location, {{and size of the}} sumps are vital to an efficient operation. When designing sumps, the amount of leachate and liquid expected is the foremost concern. Areas in which rainfall is higher than average typically have larger sumps. A further criterion for sump planning is accounting for the pump capacity. The relationship of pump capacity and sump size is inverse. If the pump capacity is low, the volume of the sump should be larger than average. It is critical for the volume of the sump to be able to store the expected leachate between pumping cycles. This relationship helps maintain a healthy operation. Sump pumps can function with preset phase times. If the flow is not predictable, a predetermined leachate height level can automatically switch the system on. Other conditions for sump planning are maintenance and pump drawdown. Collection pipes typically convey the leachate by gravity to one or more sumps, depending upon the size of the area drained. Leachate <b>collected</b> in the <b>sump</b> is removed by pumping to a vehicle, to a holding facility for subsequent vehicle pickup, or to an on-site treatment facility. Sump dimensions are governed by the amount of leachate to be stored, pump capacity, and minimum pump drawdown. The volume of the sump must be sufficient to hold the maximum amount of leachate anticipated between pump cycles, plus an additional volume equal to the minimum pump drawdown volume. Sump size should also consider dimensional requirements for conducting maintenance and inspection activities. Sump pumps may operate with preset cycling times or, if leachate flow is less predictable, the pump may be automatically switched on when the leachate reaches a predetermined level.|$|R
40|$|Water {{percolating}} into a mine is <b>collected</b> in a <b>sump</b> to be {{pumped out}} of the mine (see Figure 1). The water level sensors D and E detect when water is above a high and a low level respectively. A pump controller switches the pump on when the water reaches the high water level and off when it goes below the low water level. If, due to {{a failure of the}} pump, the water cannot be pumped out, the mine must be evacuated within one hour. The mine has other sensors (A, B, C) to monitor the carbon monoxide, methane and airflow levels. An alarm must be raised and the operator informed within one second of any of these levels becoming critical so that the mine can be evacuated within one hour. To avoid the risk of explosion, the pump must be operated only when the methane level is below a critical level. Human operators can also control the operation of the pump, but within limits. An operator can switch the pump on or off if the water is between the low and high water levels. A special operator, the supervisor, can switch the pump on or off without this restriction. In all cases, the methane level must be below its critical level if the pump is to be operated. Readings from all sensors, and a record of the operation of the pump, must be logged for later analysis. Safety requirements From the informal description of the mine pump and its operations we obtain the fol-lowing safety requirements: 1. The pump must not be operated if the methane level is critical. 2. The mine must be evacuated within one hour of the pump failing. 3. Alarms must be raised if the methane level, the carbon monoxide level or the airflow level is critical. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to discuss the testing of a spray cooling experiment designed to be flown on NASA's KC- 135 Reduced Gravity Testing Platform. Spray cooling is an example of a thermal management technique that may be utilized in high flux heat acquisition and high thermal energy transport concepts. Many researchers have investigated the utility of spray cooling for the thermal management of devices generating high heat fluxes. However, there has been little research addressing the physics and ultimate performance of spray cooling in a variable gravity environment. An experimental package, consisting of a spray chamber coupled to a fluid delivery loop system, was fabricated for variable gravity flight tests. The spray chamber contains two opposing nozzles spraying on target Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) heaters. These heaters are mounted on glass pedestals, which are part of a sump system to remove unconstrained liquid from the test chamber. Liquid is <b>collected</b> in the <b>sumps</b> and returned to the fluid delivery loop. Thermocouples mounted in and around the pedestals are used to determine both the heat loss through the underside of the IT 0 heater and the heat extracted by the spray. A series of flight tests were carried out aboard the KC- 135, utilizing the ability of the aircraft to produce various gravity conditions. During the flight tests, for a fixed flow rate, heat input was varied at 20, 30, 50, and 80 W with variable gravities of 0. 01, 0. 16, 0. 36, and 1. 8 g. Flight test data was compared to terrestrial baseline data in addition to analytical and numerical solutions to evaluate the heat transfer in the heater and support structure. There were significant differences observed in the spray cooling performance as a result of variable gravity conditions and heat inputs. In general, the Nussult number at the heater surface was found to increase with decreasing gravity conditions for heat loads greater than 30 W...|$|R
40|$|FPT 3 was {{the last}} of the five in-pile {{integral}} experiments in the Phébus FP programme, whose overall purpose was to investigate fuel rod degradation and behaviour of Fission Products (FPs) released via the primary coolant circuit into the containment building. The results contribute to validation of models and computer codes used to calculate the source term for a severe accident with core meltdown in light water reactors. Unlike the previous tests, FPT 3 used B 4 C as absorber material in the pre-irradiated (24. 5 GWd/tU) fuel bundle, while featuring a steam-poor period as in FPT 2, that used Ag/In/Cd absorber. The main FPT 3 containment results are summarised: the source term of FPs, fuel and structural materials from the experimental circuit into the containment; the composition, morphology and deposition processes of aerosols in the containment atmosphere; the specific behaviour of the radiologically-significant FP iodine; and finally the performance of Passive Autocatalytic Recombiners (PARs) exposed to the containment atmosphere just after the transient. The major elements contributing to the aerosol mass in the containment are the volatile FPs Cs and Mo, the control rod material B, the cladding material Sn, and the instrumentation materials Re and W (specific to Phébus tests). The fractional compositions, leaving aside the control rod materials, were very similar in FPT 2 and FPT 3. After reactor shutdown, homogenisation of the aerosol size in the containment led to only one aerosol population, similar to the previous tests. Long-term aerosol deposition in the containment is dominated by gravitational settling and diffusiophoresis, but also significant deposits were measured on the vertical wall, consisting of multi-component aerosols, again comparable with FPT 2. A significant result of FPT 3 is that iodine is mainly in gaseous form in the atmosphere up to containment isolation; the rest in aerosol form. Another important result is the fast decrease of the iodine concentration in the atmosphere, for total iodine (gas and aerosol), mainly due to deposition on the painted condensers; the depletion of the airborne aerosols Cs and Te was about a factor of 3 slower. As in FPT 2, gaseous iodine is mainly in molecular form. Iodine <b>collected</b> in the <b>sump</b> is essentially in soluble form throughout, probably due to the replacement of Ag/In/Cd by B 4 C as the absorber material. Concerning the PARs, which were introduced in the vessel when the overall aerosol, FP and hydrogen releases in the containment atmosphere had ended, analysis of their surface temperature evolution indicated that, despite the very low oxygen concentration in the FPT 3 containment, they worked quite well and were not poisoned by FPs during their 30 minute exposure time.

40|$|The U. S. wood {{products}} {{industry is a}} leader in the production of innovative wood materials. New products are taking shape within a growth industry for fiberboard, plywood, particle board, and other natural material-based energy efficient building materials. However, at the same time, standards for clean air are becoming ever stricter. Emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) during production of {{wood products}} (including methanol, formaldehyde, acetylaldehyde, and mercaptans) must be tightly controlled. Conventional VOC and HAP emission control techniques such as regenerative thermal oxidation (RTO) and regenerative catalytic oxidation (RCO) require significant amounts of energy and generate secondary pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and spent carbon. Biological treatment of air emissions offers a cost-effective and sustainable control technology for industrial facilities facing increasingly stringent air emission standards. A novel biological treatment system that integrates two types of biofilter systems, promises significant energy and cost savings. This novel system uses microorganisms to degrade air toxins without the use of natural gas as fuel or the creation of secondary pollutants. The replacement of conventional thermal oxidizers with biofilters will yield natural gas savings alone in the range of $ 82, 500 to $ 231, 000 per year per unit. Widespread use of biofilters across the entire forest products industry could yield fuel savings up to 5. 6 trillion Btu (British thermal units) per year and electricity savings of 2. 1 trillion Btu per year. Biological treatment systems can also eliminate the production of NOx, SO 2, and CO, and greatly reduce CO 2 emissions, when compared to conventional thermal oxidizers. Use of biofilters for VOC and HAP emission control will provide not only the wood products industry but also the pulp and paper industry with a means to cost-effectively control air emissions. The goal of this project was to demonstrate a novel sequential treatment technology that integrates two types of biofilter systems – biotrickling filtration and biofiltration – for controlling forest product facility air emissions with a water-recycling feature for water conservation. This coupling design maximizes the conditions for microbial degradation of odor causing compounds at specific locations. Water entering the biotrickling filter is <b>collected</b> in a <b>sump,</b> treated, and recycled back to the biotrickling filter. The biofilter serves as a polishing step to remove more complex organic compounds (i. e., terpenes). The gaseous emissions from the hardboard mill presses at lumber plants such as that of the Stimson Lumber Company contain both volatile and condensable organic compounds (VOC and COC, respectively), as well as fine wood and other very small particulate material. In applying bio-oxidation technology to these emissions Texas A&M University-Kingsville (TAMUK) and Bio•Reaction (BRI) evaluated the potential of this equipment to resolve two (2) control issues which are critical to the industry: • First, the hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions (primarily methanol and formaldehyde) and • Second, the fine particulate and COC from the press exhaust which contribute to visual emissions (opacity) from the stack. In a field test in 2006, the biological treatment technology met the HAP and COC control project objectives and demonstrated significantly lower energy use (than regenerative thermal oxidizers (RTOs) or regenerative catalytic oxidizers (RCOs), lower water use (than conventional scrubbers) all the while being less costly than either for maintenance. The project was successfully continued into 2007 - 2008 to assist the commercial partner in reducing unit size and footprint and cost, through added optimization of water recycle and improved biofilm activity, and demonstration of opacity removal capabilities...|$|R
40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1999 Darryl Grant StrudwickThis study investigates the occurrence and chemical composition of leachate at Clayton South and Brooklyn Municipal waste landfills in Melbourne, Victoria. Both are ‘modern’ municipal waste landfills, being engineered and managed consistent with current regulatory requirements. These landfills accept only putrescible and solid inert waste, but not soluble chemical, hazardous, liquid or prescribed industrial waste. (For complete abstract open document) Analyses of an extensive range of chemical parameters reveals a complex mixture of inorganic and organic compounds, {{similar to those of}} international authors researching leachate chemistry. Dominant ions in these leachates are NH 4 +, Na+, HC 03 - and Cl-. Except for Fe, heavy metals are not present in significant concentrations (mostly <O. 1 mgg/L). Although extensive organic analyses were undertaken, less than 15 % of the Total Organic Carbon has been quantified or identified. Volatile fatty acids, alcohols and phenolic compounds are the major organic components identified. Chlorinated hydrocarbons were measured in low concentrations (< 0. 01 to 0. 11 mg/L), particularly at Brooklyn Landfill where there is some evidence of degradation of these compounds. The concentrations of toluene (0. 03 to 0. 36 mg/L) and the xylene isomers (0. 13 to 0. 66 mg/L) are more representative of those found in mixed and hazardous waste landfills in other studies. Organochlorine and organophosphorous pesticides were not detected in any sample. Based on the results of this research, analytical parameters for sampling modern municipal waste landfills are recommended. Leachate from both Clayton South and Brooklyn Landfills is characteristic of the methanogenesis phase of waste stabilisation, although methanogenesis at Brooklyn appears more localised than at Clayton South due to a higher overall moisture content within the waste at Clayton South. Significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity of leachate quality is evident at Brooklyn Landfill. The major factors contributing to variation in leachate quality are the heterogeneity of the waste and the degree of stabilisation of organic waste in the vicinity of each sampling location. High concentrations of dichloromethane (0. 14 mg/L), toluene (1. 3 mg/L), styrene (0. 06 mg/L), phenol (l. 0 mg/L), p-cresol (13. 0 mg/L) and a-cresol (0. 55 mg/L) indicate a source of industrial waste in the vicinity of Bore 3 at Brooklyn Landfill. This study also investigated the effects of the type of sampling location (bore into landfill vs leachate collection sump) and equipment (bailer vs bladder pump) on the composition of leachate samples. The data indicates that heterogeneity in the waste that surrounds each sampling point is the primary control on leachate composition regardless of whether <b>collected</b> from a <b>sump</b> or bore. A point in the leachate collection system (a sump if sealed between sampling events) is the recommended landfill leachate sampling location, due to its collection of leachate from a larger area of the landfill (hence being a more representative sample). Collecting samples with a bailer instead of a bladder pump resulted in changed leachate chemistry due to volatilisation of ethyl benzene and xylenes, as well as increased sample turbidity, causing increased concentrations of K+, Fe, Zn, Cr, ethanoic acid and 1, 8 cineole. However, as there were no significant effects caused by sampling equipment on nearly all of the recommended sampling parameters, and due to the difficulties of gaining leachate samples from the recommended type of sampling location (leachate sump) with the bladder pump, bailers (bottom loading) are the recommended sampling equipment. Analytical results for leachates were found to be highly dependent on the selected methods of analysis and their relevance to the environment being sampled. Some traditional analytical methods for aqueous samples, such as TDS by gravimetry, SO 42 - by ICP-MS and nitrogen species by colourimetry were found to be inappropriate for modern municipal waste landfill leachates. Analytical methods for leachate from modern municipal waste landfills are recommended. Open Acces...|$|R
