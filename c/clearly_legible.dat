Once more, and for {{the last}} time, let me refer the reader to the {{important}} epoch of the death of the Doge Tomaso Mocenigo in 1423, long ago indicated as the commencement of the decline of the Venetian power.

It is recorded, that on the accession of his successor, Foscari, to the throne, [...] "SI FESTEGGIO DALLA CITTA UNO ANNO INTERO:" [...] "The city kept festival for a whole year."

60|$|Photographs are {{valuable}} in themselves, and the negatives serve for subsequent enlargements. They are unquestionably accurate, and the labour of making them being mechanical, may be delegated. If the print be in printer's ink on white paper, {{the process is}} straightforward, first of obtaining a negative and afterwards photo-prints from it. The importance of the paper or card used to receive the finger print being quite white, has already been pointed out. An imprint on white crockery-ware is beautifully clear. Some of the photographs may be advantageously printed by the ferro-prussiate process. The paper used for it does not curl when dry, its texture is good for writing on, and the blue colour of the print makes handwriting <b>clearly</b> <b>legible,</b> whether it be in ink or in pencil.|$|E

These, we might suppose, beholding, as they travelled, the condition of the states in which the Papal religion is professed, and being, at the same time, the most enlightened section of a great Protestant nation, would have been animated with some desire to dissipate the Romanist errors, and to communicate to others the better knowledge which they possessed themselves. I doubt not but that He who gave peace upon the earth, and gave it by the hand of England, expected this much of her, and has watched every one of the millions of her travellers as they crossed the sea, and kept count for him of his travelling expenses, and of their distribution, in a manner of which neither the traveller nor his courier were at all informed.

5000|$|On 20 October 1596 a {{rough draft}} was drawn {{up for an}} {{application}} to the College of Heralds for Shakespeareโs father to be granted a coat-of-arms.

The velocity of the writing is increased by shortcuts and abbreviations. Formalities of punctuation and consistent spelling are left behind, as words are pared down. Loops and tails are sheared, and letters are flattened for speed. The handwriting slows down only to produce a <b>clearly</b> <b>legible</b> italic script for proper nouns and family names. Later that day, the same person drew up a second rough draft based on the first one, incorporating the edits that were indicated in the previous draft. This application was ultimately successful, and the coat-of-arms was granted.|$|E

Our method has little blur and the text is <b>clearly</b> <b>legible.</b> Hand held long exposures often result in blurred photographs due to camera shake.

A series of photographs is acquired with short shutter times, stabilized using image alignment, and then composited. Our method is capable of reducing noise and blurring due to camera shake, while simultaneously preserving the desirable effects of motion blur.
