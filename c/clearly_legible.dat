Once more, and for {{the last}} time, let me refer the reader to the {{important}} epoch of the death of the Doge Tomaso Mocenigo in 1423, long ago indicated as the commencement of the decline of the Venetian power. That commencement is marked, not merely by the words of the dying Prince, but by a great and <b>clearly</b> <b>legible</b> sign. It is recorded, that on the accession of his successor, Foscari, to the throne, [...] "SI FESTEGGIO DALLA CITTA UNO ANNO INTERO:" [...] "The city kept festival for a whole year."

They are unquestionably accurate, and the labour of making them being mechanical, may be delegated. If the print be in printer's ink on white paper, {{the process is}} straightforward, first of obtaining a negative and afterwards photo-prints from it. The importance of the paper or card used to receive the finger print being quite white, has already been pointed out. An imprint on white crockery-ware is beautifully clear. Some of the photographs may be advantageously printed by the ferro-prussiate process. The paper used for it does not curl when dry, its texture is good for writing on, and the blue colour of the print makes handwriting <b>clearly</b> <b>legible,</b> whether it be in ink or in pencil.|$|E
6000|$|There has {{now been}} peace between England and the {{continental}} powers about thirty-five years, and during that period the English have visited the continent {{at the rate of}} many thousands a year, staying there, I suppose, on the average, each two or three months; nor these an inferior kind of English, but the kind which ought to be the best--the noblest born, the best taught, the richest in time and money, having more leisure, knowledge, and power than any other portion of the nation. These, we might suppose, beholding, as they travelled, the condition of the states in which the Papal religion is professed, and being, at the same time, the most enlightened section of a great Protestant nation, would have been animated with some desire to dissipate the Romanist errors, and to communicate to others the better knowledge which they possessed themselves. I doubt not but that He who gave peace upon the earth, and gave it by the hand of England, expected this much of her, and has watched every one of the millions of her travellers as they crossed the sea, and kept count for him of his travelling expenses, and of their distribution, in a manner of which neither the traveller nor his courier were at all informed. I doubt not, I say, but that such accounts have been literally kept for all of us, and that a day will come when they will be made <b>clearly</b> <b>legible</b> to us, and when we shall see added together, {{on one side of the}} account book, a great sum, the certain portion, whatever it may be, of this thirty-five years' spendings of the rich English, accounted for in this manner:-- ...|$|E

5000|$|On 20 October 1596 a {{rough draft}} was drawn {{up for an}} {{application}} to the College of Heralds for Shakespeare’s father to be granted a coat-of-arms. This draft has numerous emendations and corrections, and {{it appears to have}} been written by someone “inexperienced in drawing up heraldic drafts.” [...] The script is written at a great speed, but with the fluid, easy character of one well practiced with a quill. The velocity of the writing is increased by shortcuts and abbreviations. Formalities of punctuation and consistent spelling are left behind, as words are pared down. Loops and tails are sheared, and letters are flattened for speed. The handwriting slows down only to produce a <b>clearly</b> <b>legible</b> italic script for proper nouns and family names. Later that day, the same person drew up a second rough draft based on the first one, incorporating the edits that were indicated in the previous draft. This application was ultimately successful, and the coat-of-arms was granted.|$|E

Our method has little blur and the text is <b>clearly</b> <b>legible.</b> Hand held long exposures often result in blurred photographs due to camera shake. Long exposures are desirable both for artistic effect and in low-light situations.

A series of photographs is acquired with short shutter times, stabilized using image alignment, and then composited. Our method is capable of reducing noise and blurring due to camera shake, while simultaneously preserving the desirable effects of motion blur.
