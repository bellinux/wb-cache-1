25|$|Drums with {{cylindrical}} shells can be open {{at one end}} (as is {{the case}} with timbales), or can have two drum heads, one head on each end. Single-headed drums typically consist of a skin stretched over an enclosed space, or over one of the ends of a hollow vessel. Drums with two heads covering both ends of a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shell</b> often have a small hole somewhat halfway between the two heads; the shell forms a resonating chamber for the resulting sound. Exceptions include the African slit drum, also known as a log drum as it is made from a hollowed-out tree trunk, and the Caribbean steel drum, made from a metal barrel. Drums with two heads can also have a set of wires, called snares, held across the bottom head, top head, or both heads, hence the name snare drum. On some drums with two heads, a hole or bass reflex port may be cut or installed onto one head, as with some 2010s era bass drums in rock music.|$|E

2500|$|Bass drums used {{by modern}} {{ensembles}} {{come in a}} variety of sizes, with a [...] "universal" [...] depth, and diameter measured in [...] increments from 14 to [...] The heads of these drums are usually made of a smooth white PET film, which gives a tonality that is midway between clear and coated heads. Unlike tenors and snares, bass drums are mounted so that the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shell</b> of the drum is mounted on the player's harness and the two drum heads of the drum face out sideways. [...] The player can then play on both heads, one arm for a drum head on either side. [...] Each drummer plays and carries one drum, and a line is created by having several people carry different-sized drums. Such drums are called tonal bass drums. [...] The lowest drum in a line, however, is often tuned to have a low [...] "thump" [...] like a traditional bass drum rather than a tone. The Cavaliers Drum and Bugle Corps were the first marching unit to use and standardize tonal bass drum tuning. Many groups try to use the largest size bass drum that is comfortable for the physically largest bass drummer to carry as the bottom bass drum, as larger people are generally better able to carry a bigger drum for long periods of time.|$|E

30|$|During {{the past}} decades, several {{researches}} {{have been conducted}} on the linear elastic buckling of shells. However, the empirical investigations done by Arbocz and Hol (1991) and Jullien and Limam (1998) proved that the buckling capacity values of thin-walled <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shells</b> are lower than those predicted through Timoshenko’s classical theory (Timoshenko and Gere 1961). Toda (1983) has empirically studied the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shells</b> with circular cutouts under axial compression; he investigated the stiffness effect around the cutouts as well. Jullien and Limam (1998) studied the effects of circular, square and rectangular cutouts on the buckling of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shells</b> under axial compression using CASTEM 2000, a finite element software, and presented a parametric relation based on the shapes and dimensions of the cutouts. Van Dyke (1965) computed the stress distribution around {{an opening in the}} <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shells</b> with cutout under axial, torsional and internal compressive loadings. Tennyson (1968) has empirically studied the effects of circular cutout of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shells</b> under axial compression and compared the obtained buckling load values with the analytical results of Van Dyke (1965). Yeh et al. (1999) have assessed, analytically and empirically, the torsional buckling of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shells</b> with cutout. Brogan and Almorth (1970) have studied the effects of rectangular cutout on the buckling load of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shells</b> and compared the obtained experimental results with those of STAGS program. Starnes (1970) has empirically studied the effect of circular cutout on the buckling of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shells</b> under axial compression and obtained a high limit for buckling load by Reyleigh–Ritz method. Han et al. (2006) has applied nonlinear numerical method using ANSYS software to study the size and location effects of square cutouts on the thin- and thick-walled <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shells</b> and presented several parametric relations based on his analytical and empirical results. Tafreshi (2002) has applied ABAQUS software to investigate the buckling and post-buckling behaviors of composite <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shells</b> with rectangular cutout under axial and internal compressive loadings. He has concluded that the buckling capacity load increases with increasing the internal compression. Shariati and Mahdizadeh Rokhi (2010) have studied the effects of elliptical cutouts with different sizes and angles on the buckling of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shells</b> under axial compressive load.

30|$|Thin-walled <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shells</b> are {{important}} components of many industrial complexes. Most of these components have circular cutouts in manholes and pipe-to-shell junctions. Performance of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shells</b> {{due to the}} extreme loading conditions shows that buckling is the major failure mode in such components. This study aims to indicate the effect of circular cutouts on buckling capacity of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shells</b> due to pure axial compression.

Cutouts reduce the local buckling capacity of shell about 10 – 15  % in the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shells,</b> with the diameter to thickness ratio of less than 1, 000.
