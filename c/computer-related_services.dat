40|$|This {{research}} {{based on}} interviews, questionnaires and case studies, attempts {{to identify the}} principal variables, which shape internationalization of <b>computer-related</b> (CR) <b>service</b> firms and to evaluate {{their impact on the}} firms' performance in international markets. What is distinctive about the firm's internationalization in the CR services sector and what do those differences imply for marketing strategies worldwide? What are the critical variables of success (or failure) for different mode(s) of entry? What is the CR service firms' perception of the geographical/cultural distance and the regulatory barriers in export market? What are the firms' rationales to engage in international activities? How do perception of the export market and motivations towards international activities influence the choice of the entry mode(s) ? What are the distinctive characteristics of each CR sub-sector and what lessons can be drawn from their comparative assessment for the globalization process of CR services and services in general? The objective of this project is to contribute to the underlying research body of knowledge on service firms' internationalization and to provide guideline for CR service firms that undertake the globalization process. Introduction : Every period in economic history has its hero. The current digital revolution is brought about by the significant drop in cost and rapid expansion of power of digital devices such as computers and telecommunications. Today's digital world is a world where all kinds of computers, equipment and appliances are interconnected and functioning as one unit. Such complex systems cannot operate without a set of <b>computer-related</b> (CR) <b>services</b> which assume strategic role in the digital economy. This is a fascinating issue that {{is at the heart of}} the contemporary economy. The evolution of technologies through the progress made in the data processing and transmission have considerably decreased the physical and technical distance between the actors concerned. Hence the international development of service firms is almost an obligation imposed by the changes of the world economic environment and the tendency towards globalization of markets. Internationalization seems to be a permanent preoccupation for firms, especially in the CR services sector which has the characteristics of being relatively young and cosmopolitan. In the context of globalization, firms providing CR services have a particular place which renders the analysis of their internationalization process meaningful and interesting. As international trade in this sector is among the fastest growing areas of global trade, it offers a particularly promising field of investigation...|$|R
40|$|Adopters and non-adopters of home {{computers}} were contrasted {{in terms of}} their demographics, psychographics, and experiences with technical consumer prod-ucts. Experiences with other <b>computer-related</b> products and <b>services</b> were found to playa major role in movement toward purchase of a home computer. Further, the profile of the adopter appears to be consistent with that of a particular type of creative consumer. Studies of the adoption process for innovations have generated different profiles of the consumer innovator. The early literature from rural sociology painted a picture of the innovator as something of a misfit in society. For example, Barnett (1941) found that the disgruntled, the maladjusted, the frustrated, or the incompetent are preem-inently the accepters of cultural innovations and change. More recently, the consumer behavior literature has por-trayed innovators as socially integrated (Schiffman an...|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In testimony in October 2002 and in a report issued in April 2003 we raised concerns about the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) accountability for computers and computer-related equipment bought with government purchase cards. Our review identified a large volume of computers and computer-related purchases for which HUD did not have adequate supporting documentation. In addition, HUD acknowledged that items bought with purchase cards were not being consistently entered in its asset management system thereby increasing its vulnerability to loss or theft. Given these findings, and the approximately $ 59 million HUD reported it has spent on computers and <b>computer-related</b> equipment and <b>services</b> over the last 3 fiscal years, Congress asked of us to further assess HUD's accountability for these vulnerable assets. Specifically, it was requested that we determine whether HUD had established an effective system of internal control for maintaining accountability over its computer equipment. Our review covered HUD's systems and controls in place during fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003. ...|$|R

50|$|TIES's success, {{and similar}} {{projects}} run by Minneapolis Public Schools and Minnesota State University, Mankato, {{led to the}} founding of MECC in 1973 by the state legislature. As a Joint Powers Authority, {{with the support of}} the University of Minnesota, the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System, and the Minnesota Department of Education, MECC's role was to study and coordinate computer use in schools for both administrative and educational purposes. Schools, including the universities, had to get MECC's approval for most computing expenses, and were also its customers for <b>computer-related</b> <b>services.</b> After study of educational needs, a single educational computer center in the Minneapolis area was recommended for use by schools throughout the state (the University of Minnesota's MERITSS computer provided time-sharing services to its campuses and to state universities).

40|$|The {{transition}} {{economies of}} Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) have become important exporters of {{many types of}} services to Western Europe. We identify the sources of CEE's advantages over competing exporters, such as India, China and Brazil, using disaggregated data on service exports and a novel estimation technique for the gravity equation. Our {{results indicate that the}} importance of geographical distance varies substantially across types of service exports. Geography is important for exports of construction services, but it has a negligible impact on <b>computer-related</b> <b>services.</b> However, the relative quality of legal institutions influences trade across a broad range of service categories. The results demonstrate that aggregating services that are not homogeneous could conceal important differences in the effects of geographical distance and other variables on the pattern of service trade.

40|$|Abstract. We present our {{practical}} experience in implementing an agent-based system for provision and selection of Grid services. The agents form a marketplace where services are offered and searched. Agents communicate semantic information about services using the Web service ontology (OWL-S). We describe our implementation that {{is built on}} Globus Toolkit 3 and utilizes the JADE agent framework and an off-the-shelf OWL-S toolkit. This combination of technologies {{can be used for}} more sophisticated agent-based services, such as e. g. automatic composition of services. We illustrate and evaluate our framework using a simple example, yet without loosing generality. We present preliminary evaluation results leaving stronger evaluation to future work. Our evaluation captures the relative costs of different stages during service provision and selection that allows detecting potential bottlenecks. 1 Introduction and Related Work The Grid is envisioned as a global ubiquitous infrastructure that allows to treat all kinds of <b>computer-related</b> <b>services</b> as commodity- that can be described, located...|$|E
40|$|Opponents {{of health}} care reform in the United States have often argued that such reform will be {{detrimental}} to small and medium-sized enterprises. The authors review the most recent data from a sample of 22 rich countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), all of which, except the United States, have universal health care systems. By every measure of small-business employment, the United States has among the world’s smallest small-business sectors (as a proportion of total national employment). These findings hold for self-employed workers and across all industry groups for which the Paris-based OECD publishes internationally comparable data, including manufacturing, <b>computer-related</b> <b>services,</b> and research and development.

40|$|The recent {{financial}} literature contains several {{analyses of}} the characteristics and performance of various classes of stocks and investment strategies. These include the analysis of value vs. glamour stocks, IPO firms, and contrarian/momentum investment strategies. We examine a previously unexplored class of stocks generally distinct from these groups but discussed regularly in the financial press {{over the past three}} decades: concept stocks. Empirically, concept stocks are defined as firms with extremely high levels of market to sales. To many, these stocks appear overvalued. However, proponents argue that because of their unique characteristics, traditional pricing models fail to correctly value these firms. Using a sample extending from 1967 through 1999, we demonstrate that the identity and characteristics of concept stocks have changed dramatically over time. Although the obvious recent examples are Internet and biotech stocks, concept stocks characterize every period. The industries containing the most popular concept stocks evolve from oil and gas extraction in the 60 s and 70 s, to computer and office equipment in the 80 s, and to <b>computer-related</b> <b>services</b> in the 90 s. We find that the sales-to-market ratio has decreased considerably over the sample period and that the percentage of firms with positive earnings has sharply declined. In more recent years, concept stocks tend to be larger in terms of market value, less profitable and with a higher level of R&D and capital investment. The analysis of long-run performance of concept stocks, using both Fama-French factors and buy-and-hold returns, reveals significant underperformance. The results are robust to extensive sensitivity analysis and are separate from glamour, IPO, or contrarian effects. 1...|$|E
40|$|The Oklahoma Geological Survey (OGS), the Geo Information Systems department, and the School of Petroleum and Geological Engineering at the University of Oklahoma {{are engaged}} in a five-year program to {{identify}} and address Oklahoma`s oil recovery opportunities in fluvial-dominated deltaic (FDD) reservoirs. This program includes a systematic and comprehensive collection and evaluation of information on all FDD oil reservoirs in Oklahoma and the recovery technologies that have been (or could be) applied to those reservoirs with commercial success. During 1996, three highly successful FDD workshops involving 6 producing formations (4 plays) were completed: (1) Layton and Osage-Layton April 17 (2) Prue and Skinner June 19 and 26 (3) Cleveland October 17 (4) Peru October 17 (combined with Cleveland play). Each play was presented individually using the adopted protocol of stratigraphic interpretations, a regional overview, and two or more detailed field studies. The project goal was to have one field study from each play selected for waterflood simulation in order to demonstrate enhanced recovery technologies {{that can be used to}} recovery secondary oil. In this effort, software utilized for reservoir simulation included Eclipse and Boast 111. In some cases, because of poor production records and inadequate geologic data, field studies completed in some plays were not suitable for modeling. All of the workshops included regional sandstone trend analysis, updated field boundary identification, a detailed bibliography and author reference map, and detailed field studies. Discussion of general FDD depositional concepts was also given. In addition to the main workshop agenda, the workshops provided computer mapping demonstrations and rock cores with lithologic and facies interpretations. In addition to the workshops, other elements of FDD program were improved during 1996. Most significant was the refinement of NRIS MAPS - a user-friendly computer program designed to access NRIS data and interface with mapping software such as Arc View in order to produce various types of information maps. Most commonly used are well base maps for field studies, lease production maps, and regional maps showing well production codes, formation show codes, well spud dates, and well status codes. These regional maps are valuable in identifying areas of by-passed oil production, field trends, and time periods of development for the various FDD plays in Oklahoma. Besides maps, NRIS MAPS provides data in table format which can be used to generate production decline curves and estimates of cumulative hydrocarbon production for leases and fields. Additionally, many <b>computer-related</b> <b>services</b> were provided by support staff concerning technical training, private consultation, computer mapping, and data acquisition...|$|E
