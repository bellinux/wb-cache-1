Cdc 42 is necessary for <b>cellular</b> <b>protrusions</b> and, when absent, wounds are slow to repair and never completely close. Rac proteins accumulate at specific regions in the wound leading edge cells and Rac-deficient embryos exhibit slower repair kinetics.

Cancer-related truncation mutations lack direct and indirect binding sites for microtubules in APC, suggesting that loss of this function contributes to defects in APC-mutant cells. In this study, we show that loss of APC results in disappearance of <b>cellular</b> <b>protrusions</b> and decreased cell migration.

40|$|Abstract Background Diaphanous-related formins govern actin-based {{processes}} {{involved in}} many cellular functions, such as cell movement and invasion. Possible connections to developmental processes and cellular changes associated with malignant phenotype make them interesting study targets. In spite of this, very little is known of the tissue distribution and cellular location of any mammalian formin. Here we have carried out a comprehensive analysis of the formin family member formin -like 2 (FMNL 2) in human tissues. Results An FMNL 2 antibody was raised and characterized. The affinity-purified FMNL 2 antibody was validated by Western blotting, Northern blotting, a peptide competition assay and siRNA experiments. Bioinformatics-based mRNA profiling indicated that FMNL 2 is widely expressed in human tissues. The highest mRNA levels were seen in central and peripheral nervous systems. Immunohistochemical analysis of 26 different human tissues showed that FMNL 2 is widely expressed, {{in agreement with the}} mRNA profile. The widest expression was detected in the central nervous system, since both neurons and glial cells expressed FMNL 2. Strong expression was also seen in many epithelia. However, the expression in different cell types was not ubiquitous. Many mesenchymal cell types showed weak immunoreactivity and cells lacking expression were seen in many tissues. The subcellular location of FMNL 2 was cytoplasmic, and in some tissues a strong perinuclear dot was detected. In cultured cells FMNL 2 showed mostly a cytoplasmic localization with perinuclear accumulation consistent with the Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, FMNL 2 co-localized with F-actin to the tips of <b>cellular</b> <b>protrusions</b> in WM 164 human melanoma cells. This finding is in line with FMNL 2 's proposed function in the formation of actin filaments in <b>cellular</b> <b>protrusions,</b> during amoeboid cellular migration.

To examine the intracellular events of coxsackievirus B 3 (CVB 3) infection, green monkey kidney (GMK) cells were either inoculated with the virus or transfected with the viral RNA. Various microscopic and flow cytometric approaches demonstrated the emergence of CVB 3 capsid proteins at 8 h posttransfection, followed by morphological transformation of the cells. The morphological changes included formation of membranous protrusions containing viral capsids, together with microtubules and actin. Translocation of viral capsids into these protrusions was sensitive to cytochalasin D, suggesting the importance of actin in the process. Three-dimensional (3 D) live-cell imaging demonstrated frequent contacts between <b>cellular</b> <b>protrusions</b> and adjacent cells. Markedly, in spite {{of an increase in}} the cellular viral protein content starting 8 h postinfection, no significant decrease in cell viability or increase in the amount of early apoptotic markers was observed by flow cytometry by 28 h postinfection.

Reducing the activities of the guidance receptors EGFR and PVR did not result in the expected inhibition of protrusion, but instead resulted in protrusion in all directions.

CD 44 functioned as a critical regulator of intratumoral movement by stabilizing cell polarity in migrating T cells, but not during target cell interactions.

Interestingly, Smurf 1 overexpression in Neuro 2 a cells dramatically reduces RhoA protein levels during dibutyric cyclic AMP, but not retinoic acid induced neurite outgrowth. This Smurf 1 -dependent reduction in RhoA protein levels was abrogated using the general proteasome inhibitor MG 132, suggesting that RhoA is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation via Smurf 1. Together, our data suggest that localized regulation of different subsets of Rho GTPases by specific guidance signals results in an intracellular asymmetry of RhoA activity, which could regulate neurite outgrowth and guidance...|$|R

Proliferation of the metacestode apparently occurs by protruding filamentous solid cell columns (buds) from the germinal layer. Their tips have diameters of only one cell: they are covered with a smooth syncytial tegument without microtriches and are filled with undifferentiated cells which contain a nucleus with a large nucleolus. The tegument is constantly enlarged by fusion with the underlying undifferentiated cells that divide repeatedly. At some distance from the tip a cavity develops inside the protrusion, thus finally giving rise to a tube-like structure which may transform to a cystic expansion. Simultaneously, the surface of the protrusion changes by the formation of microtriches and the occurrence of an amorphous laminated layer.

We present an integrated, quantitative study of these parameters across {{a broad range of}} complex matrix configurations using self-assembling 3 D collagen and show how each parameter relates to the others and to cell motility. Increasing collagen density resulted in a decrease and then an increase in both pore size and fiber alignment, which both correlated significantly with cell motility but not bulk matrix stiffness within the range tested.

Several Arg-interacting proteins are potential {{links to the}} actin cytoskeleton, but exactly how Arg stimulates actin polymerization and <b>cellular</b> <b>protrusion</b> {{has not yet been}} fully elucidated. We used affinity purification to identify N-WASp as a novel binding partner of Arg. N-WASp activates the Arp 2 / 3 complex and is an effector of Abl. We find that the Arg SH 3 domain binds directly to N-WASp. Arg phosphorylates N-WASp on Y 256, modestly increasing the affinity of Arg for N-WASp, an interaction that does not require the Arg SH 2 domain. The Arg SH 3 domain stimulates N-WASp-dependent actin polymerization in vitro, and Arg phosphorylation of N-WASp weakly stimulates this effect. Arg and N-WASp colocalize to adhesion-dependent cell edge protrusions in vivo. The cell edge protrusion defects of arg-/- fibroblasts can be complemented by re-expression of an Arg-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusion, but not by an N-WASp binding-deficient Arg SH 3 domain point mutant.

Considering the simplified case of a noninteracting, one-filament system, we calculate the length probability distribution in the growing phase and its stationary form in a continuum approximation of the finite-length phase.

40|$|SummarySoluble {{guidance}} cues can direct <b>cellular</b> <b>protrusion</b> {{and migration}} by modulating adhesion and cytoskeletal dynamics. Actin filaments (F-actins) polymerize at {{the leading edge}} of motile cells and depolymerize proximally [1, 2]; this, together with myosin II activity, induces retrograde flow of F-actins [3 - 5]. It has been proposed that the traction forces underlying cellular motility may be regulated by the modulation of coupling efficiency between F-actin flow and the extracellular substrate via “clutch” molecules [6 - 10]. However, how cell signaling controls the coupling efficiency remains unknown. Shootin 1 functions as a linker molecule that couples F-actin retrograde flow and the substrate at neuronal growth cones to promote axon outgrowth [11]. Here we show that shootin 1 is located at a critical interface, transducing a chemical signal into traction forces for axon outgrowth. We found that a chemoattractant, netrin- 1, positively regulates traction forces at axonal growth cones via Pak 1 -mediated shootin 1 phosphorylation. This phosphorylation enhanced the interaction between shootin 1 and F-actin retrograde flow, thereby promoting F-actin-substrate coupling, force generation, and concomitant filopodium extension and axon outgrowth. These results suggest that dynamic actin-substrate coupling can transduce chemical signals into mechanical forces to control cellular motility and provide a molecular-level description of how this transduction may occur...|$|R

For a selection of compounds (Clofibrate, Gefitinib, Sirolimus, Imexon and Dexamethasone) their ability to restore ciliogenesis was confirmed in a panel of human cancer cell line models representing different cancer types (pancreas, lung, kidney, breast). Most compounds attenuated cell proliferation, at least in part through induction of the primary cilium, as demonstrated by cilium removal using chloral hydrate.

40|$|The major {{structural}} and enzymatically active protein in spicules from siliceous sponges, e. g., for Suberites domuncula studied here, is silicatein. Silicatein {{has been established}} {{to be the key}} enzyme that catalyzes the formation of biosilica, a polymer that represents the inorganic scaffold for the spicule. In the present study, it is shown, by application of high-resolution transmission and scanning transmission electron microscopy that, during the initial phase of spicule synthesis, nanofibrils with a diameter of around 10 nm are formed that comprise bundles of between 10 and 20 nanofibrils. In intracellular vacuoles, silicasomes, the nanofibrils form polar structures with a pointed tip and a blunt end. In a time-dependent manner, these nanofibrillar bundles become embedded into a Si-rich matrix, indicative for the formation of biosilica via silicatein molecules that form the nanofibrils. These biosilicified nanofibrillar bundles become extruded from the intracellular space, where they are located in the silicasomes, to the extracellular environment by an evagination process, during which a <b>cellular</b> <b>protrusion</b> forms the axial canal in the growing spicule. The nanofibrillar bundles condense and progressively form the axial filament that becomes localized in the extracellular space. It is concluded that the silicateincomposing nanofibrils act not only as enzymatic silica biocondensing platforms but also as a structure-giving guidance for the growing spicule...|$|R
