50|$|The Terryville Waterwheel {{is located}} in Terryville, a {{historic}} 19th-century manufacturing district of eastern Plymouth, and now the town's main commercial center. It {{is located on the}} north side of Main Street (United States Route 6) on the western bank of the swiftly flowing Pequabuck River.

Most of the wheel's parts are pressure-treated wood, replacing original materials in a 1990-91 restoration.

50|$|John Anderson was {{prominent}} in the establishment in February 1861 of the “Farmers Joint Stock Flour Mill” by Smeaton farmers. Plans to build a mill fell through, but the Andersons determined that they would build their own flour and oat mill in June 1861. The five-story bluestone mill was completed and opened on 29 April 1862, with the oat milling section being completed by the following harvest season. The water wheel follows designs developed by John Smeaton, incorporating wrought iron spokes and <b>cast</b> iron <b>hub</b> and gears. The foundry patterns remained on site, with the original components having been cast by Hunt and Opies Victoria Foundry in Ballarat. The water supply for the water wheel comes from Hepburn Lagoon, located about 5 km from the mill, and delivered via Birch Creek and a water race, with the last section in an wrought iron trough elevated on timber trestles. It is likely that John Anderson {{was responsible for the}} design of the mill, and the drafting of the drawings in the Latrobe Library, as he had been apprenticed in Scotland to a millwright.|$|R

Heavy duty wheels are used in applications as automatic vehicles and {{are mainly composed of}} a polyurethane tread glued to a <b>cast</b> iron <b>hub.</b> The adhesive application between tread and hub is the most critical assembly phase, since it is completely made by an operator and a contamination of the link area may happen. Furthermore the presence of rust on the hub surface can contribute to worsen the adherence interface, reducing the operating life. Several wheels with different types of faults have been manufactured ad hoc with anomalies similar to the ones that can really be originated. Synchronous average is calculated over the wheel rotation in order to highlight the phenomena that have the wheel rotation as periodicity (e. g. the contact between defect and test bench drum). Successively, cyclostationary theory is applied to extract information from the frequency/order domain of the processed signals. Eventually, well-suited indicators/coefficients are applied to the processed signals, objectifying the anomaly presence and defining pass-fail reference values based on the nonstatistical Tukey’s method...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a study {{and implementation of}} the simulation of residual stresses in castings. The objects of study are a <b>cast</b> iron truck <b>Hub</b> part (provided by the company Volvo 3 P) and an optimized version of the Hub resulting from the application of a topology optimization process. The models are solved through an uncoupled thermo-mechanical solidification analysis, performed both in the FE commercial software Abaqus and the FD commercial software Magmasoft and the results are compared. First, a thermal analysis is carried out where the casting is cooled down from a super-heated temperature to room temperature. The thermal history obtained, is then used as an external force to calculate the residual stresses by means of a quasi-static mechanical analysis, using a J 2 -plasticity model. The simulation procedures are explained through a simplified model of the Hub and then applied to the geometries of interest. A results comparison between the original Hub and its optimized version is also presented. The theoretical base is given in this work as well as detailed implementation procedures. The results shows that the part subjected to the topology optimization process develop less residual stresses than its original version...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} work {{reported in this}} thesis aims at developing a methodology and a procedure for the condition monitoring and diagnostics of heavy-duty wheels based on vibration measurements {{at the end of}} the production line. The early detection of manufacturing anomalies is necessary to sensibly reduce the time/money lost due to possible problems that can rise up during the operating phases. Heavy-duty wheels are used in applications as automatic vehicles and motor trucks and are mainly composed of a polyurethane tread glued to a <b>cast</b> iron <b>hub.</b> The adhesive application between tread and hub is the most critical assembly phase, since it is completely made by an operator and a contamination of the link area between polyurethane and cast iron may happen. Furthermore the presence of rust on the hub surface can contribute to worsen the adherence interface and to reduce the operating life. As the author is aware, studies by other researchers concerning the fault detection in heavy-duty wheels are not present in literature. In order to develop a detection procedure, several wheels with different types of faults have been manufactured “ad hoc” with anomalies similar to real ones. Such anomalies consist of incorrectly adherence zones between tread and hub as well as localized or distributed rust on the hub surface. Numerous experimental tests have been carried out in order to identify the vibration effects of these defects as a function of fault type and dimensions. The thesis concerns the detection and diagnostic capability of different vibration processing techniques using well-suited indicators and determining pass/fail decision thresholds through the Tukey’s non-statistical method. Contemporary, an accurate dynamic analysis of this mechanical system has been conducted - both experimentally through modal analysis techniques and numerically through finite element method - in order to establish the influence of the dynamic properties of the system components (namely heavy-duty wheel, support, frame of the test set up) on the measured vibratory signal. Based on this dynamic characterization, a multibody model of the system has been developed: the heavy-duty wheel is considered as rigid and the yielding part is focused in the contact patch between wheel and drum. A non-linear elastic contact algorithm is adopted, based on stiffness properties previously extracted from static tests conducted on both material specimens and complete components. The model makes it possible to reproduce the vibration effects of the defects and to simulate signal modifications due to different component materials and design. as Synchronous Average and Cyclostationarity Analysis...|$|R
