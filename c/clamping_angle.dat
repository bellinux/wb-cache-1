The rates and force dependence of steps in the mechanochemical cycle of linear motors have been probed giving detailed insight into motor mechanisms. With similar goals in mind for rotary molecular motors we present here an optical trapping system designed as an <b>angle</b> <b>clamp</b> to study the bacterial flagellar motor and F 1 -ATPase. The trap position was controlled by a digital signal processing board and a host computer via acousto-optic deflectors, the motor position via a three-dimensional piezoelectric stage and the motor angle using a pair of polystyrene beads as a handle for the optical trap. Bead-pair angles were detected using back focal plane interferometry with a resolution of up to 1 °, and controlled using a feedback algorithm with a precision of up to 2 ° and a bandwidth of up to 1. 6 kHz. Details of the optical trap, algorithm, and alignment procedures are given. Preliminary data showing angular control of F 1 -ATPase and angular and speed control of the bacterial flagellar motor are presented...|$|R

A contact model of the conductor and the clamp was established by using finite element method. The effects of sag angle of the conductor, holding force and tension force in section are analyzed. The {{results showed that the}} contact area {{in the middle of the}} clamp is of belt-like type. The extreme values of tress were observed on the edge of the contact area and near the edge of keeper. In <b>clamp</b> section, suspension <b>angle</b> had the greatest influence on contact stress, and then the clamp force. The tension force in section played a most important role in these affecting factors. In the exit section of clamp, the biggest impact factor was tension force in this section, then the suspension angle, the third was clamp force. The results provide theoretical basis on reducing corona loss, optimization the clamp. Doubtlessly, the conclusion has important theoretical significance and application value...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPre-stressing of masonry {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} building/facility reconstruction methods. In the Czech Republic it is very successful, especially in the Moravian-Silesian Region, which is subject to a considerable amount of disturbances of buildings/facilities due to undermining. Pre-stressing in masonry can be achieved by means of steel wire ropes or rods. These steel elements are inserted into the pre-milled grooves, which may be in the external or internal wall face. The ends of the steel elements are <b>clamped</b> into steel <b>angles</b> or special anchors. In these reconstruction methods it is necessary to follow the pre- stressing procedures and technologies. It is important to properly select the pre-stressing anchoring system, appropriate layout and arrangement of pre-stressing wires, pre-stressing procedure and dimension of pre-stressing forces in the individual wires. This contribution deals with experimental measurements of deformations in the place exposed to local load caused by additional pre-stressing. The measurements are taken on a masonry corner built in the laboratory equipment. This laboratory equipment was designed at the Faculty of Civil Engineering VSB – TU Ostrava for measurement of the tri-axial stress-strain conditions in masonry. Two pre-stressing bars are placed in this masonry corner. These bars are at different heights and are anchored to the anchor plates, which transfer pre-stressing forces to the masonry. The specimen for laboratory testing is performed at the actual proportion of 1 : 1. Mathematical modeling of the brick corner is based on the finite element method using ANSYS software and then the results are compared with results of the laboratory tests. On the basis of these results it should be possible to improve the models and come closer to achieving an accurate and at the same time, simple procedure for the design of pre-stressed masonry...|$|R
40|$|F 1 -ATPase, {{the sector}} of ATP synthase where the {{synthesis}} of cellular ATP occurs, is a rotary molecular motor in its own right. Driven by ATP hydrolysis, direct observation of {{the rotation of the}} central axis within single molecules of F 1 is possible. Operating at close to 100 % efficiency, F 1 from thermophilic Bacillus has been shown to produce ~ 40 pN˙nm of torque during rotation. This thesis details the groundwork required for the direct measurement of the torque produced by F 1 using a rotary <b>angle</b> <b>clamp,</b> an optical trapping system specifically designed for application to rotary molecular motors. Proof-of-concept experiments will be presented thereby demonstrating the ability to directly manipulate single F 1 molecules from Escherichia coli and yeast mitochondria (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), along with activation of F 1 out of its inhibited state by the application of external torque. Despite in-depth knowledge of the rotary mechanism of F 1 from thermophilic Bacillus, the rotation of F 1 from Escherichia coli is relatively poorly understood. A detailed mechanical characterization of E. coli F 1 will be presented here, with particular attention to the ground states within the catalytic cycle, notably the ATP-binding state, the catalytic state and the inhibited state. The fundamental mechanism of E. coli F 1 appears to depart little from that of F 1 from thermophilic Bacillus, although, at room temperature, chemical processes occur faster within the E. coli enzyme, in line with considerations regarding the physiological conditions of the different species. Also presented here is the verification of the rotary nature of yeast mitochondrial F 1. The torque produced by F 1 from thermophilic Bacillus, E. coli and yeast mitochondria is the same, within experimental error, despite their diverse evolutionary and environmental origins. This thesis is not currently available in OR...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Sliding clamps, such as Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) in eukaryotes, are {{ring-shaped}} protein complexes that encircle DNA {{and enable}} highly processive DNA replication by serving as docking sites for DNA polymerases. In an ATP-dependent reaction, clamp loader complexes, {{such as the}} Replication Factor-C (RFC) complex in eukaryotes, open the clamp and load it around primer-template DNA. Results We built a model of RFC bound to PCNA and DNA based on existing crystal structures of clamp loaders. This model suggests that DNA would enter the <b>clamp</b> at an <b>angle</b> during <b>clamp</b> loading, thereby interacting with positively charged residues {{in the center of}} PCNA. We show that simultaneous mutation of Lys 20, Lys 77, Arg 80, and Arg 149, which interact with DNA in the RFC-PCNA-DNA model, compromises the ability of yeast PCNA to stimulate the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of RFC when the DNA is long enough to extend through the clamp. Fluorescence anisotropy binding experiments show that the inability of the mutant clamp proteins to stimulate RFC ATPase activity is likely caused by reduction in the affinity of the RFC-PCNA complex for DNA. We obtained several crystal forms of yeast PCNA-DNA complexes, measuring X-ray diffraction data to 3. 0 &# 197; resolution for one such complex. The resulting electron density maps show that DNA is bound in a tilted orientation relative to PCNA, but makes different contacts than those implicated in clamp loading. Because of apparent partial disorder in the DNA, we restricted refinement of the DNA to a rigid body model. This result contrasts with previous analysis of a bacterial clamp bound to DNA, where the DNA was well resolved. Conclusion Mutational analysis of PCNA suggests that positively charged residues {{in the center of the}} clamp create a binding surface that makes contact with DNA. Disruption of this positive surface, which had not previously been implicated in clamp loading function, reduces RFC ATPase activity in the presence of DNA, most likely by reducing the affinity of RFC and PCNA for DNA. The interaction of DNA is not, however, restricted to one orientation, as indicated by analysis of the PCNA-DNA co-crystals...|$|R
40|$|Shearing is {{the process}} where sheet metal is {{mechanically}} cut between two tools. Various shearing technologies are commonly used in the sheet metal industry, for example, in cut to length lines, slitting lines, end cropping etc. Shearing has speed and cost advantages over competing cutting methods like laser and plasma cutting, but involves large forces on the equipment and large strains in the sheet material. The constant development of sheet metals toward higher strength and formability leads to increased forces on the shearing equipment and tools. Shearing of new sheet materials imply new suitable shearing parameters. Investigations of the shearing parameters through live tests in the production are expensive and separate experiments are time consuming and requires specialized equipment. Studies involving {{a large number of}} parameters and coupled effects are therefore preferably performed by finite element based simulations. Accurate experimental data is still a prerequisite to validate such simulations. There is, however, a shortage of accurate experimental data to validate such simulations. In industrial shearing processes, measured forces are always larger than the actual forces acting on the sheet, due to friction losses. Shearing also generates a force that attempts to separate the two tools with changed shearing conditions through increased clearance between the tools as result. Tool clearance is also the most common shearing parameter to adjust, depending on material grade and sheet thickness, to moderate the required force and to control the final sheared edge geometry. In this work, an experimental procedure that provides a stable tool clearance together with accurate measurements of tool forces and tool displacements, was designed, built and evaluated. Important shearing parameters and demands on the experimental set-up were identified in a sensitivity analysis performed with finite element simulations under the assumption of plane strain. With respect to large tool clearance stability and accurate force measurements, a symmetric experiment with two simultaneous shears and internal balancing of forces attempting to separate the tools was constructed. Steel sheets of different strength levels were sheared using the above mentioned experimental set-up, with various tool clearances, sheet <b>clamping</b> and rake <b>angles.</b> Results showed that tool penetration before fracture decreased with increased material strength. When one side of the sheet was left unclamped and free to move, the required shearing force decreased but instead the force attempting to separate the two tools increased. Further, the maximum shearing force decreased and the rollover increased with increased tool clearance. Digital image correlation was applied to measure strains on the sheet surface. The obtained strain fields, together with a material model, were used to compute the stress state in the sheet. A comparison, up to crack initiation, of these experimental results with corresponding results from finite element simulations in three dimensions and at a plane strain approximation showed that effective strains on the surface are representative also for the bulk material. A simple model was successfully applied to calculate the tool forces in shearing with angled tools from forces measured with parallel tools. These results suggest that, with respect to tool forces, a plane strain approximation is valid also at angled tools, at least for small rake angles. In general terms, this study provide a stable symmetric experimental set-up with internal balancing of lateral forces, for accurate measurements of tool forces, tool displacements, and sheet deformations, to study the effects of important shearing parameters. The results give further insight to the strain and stress conditions at crack initiation during shearing, and {{can also be used to}} validate models of the shearing process...|$|R
