5|$|He {{continued}} {{writing and}} eventually put together his first play, Removing All Doubt, which {{he sent to}} his old Syracuse theatre teacher, Arthur Storch, who was impressed. In 1984, Removing All Doubt was staged for drama students at his alma mater, Syracuse University. After that, he wrote Hidden in This Picture which debuted off-off-Broadway at Steve Olsen's West Bank Cafe Downstairs Theatre Bar in New York City in 1988. The <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> first two plays got him a theatrical agent. Producer John A. McQuiggan saw the production of Hidden in This Picture and commissioned Sorkin to turn the one-act into a full-length play called Making Movies.|$|E
5|$|As Buoso Donati lies {{dead in his}} curtained four-poster bed, his {{relatives}} gather round to mourn his passing, but are really more interested in learning the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> will. Among those present are his cousins Zita and Simone, his poor-relation brother-in-law Betto, and Zita's nephew Rinuccio. Betto mentions a rumour he has heard that Buoso has left everything to a monastery; this disturbs the others and precipitates a frantic search for the will. The document is found by Rinuccio, who is confident that his uncle has left him plenty of money. He withholds the will momentarily and asks Zita {{to allow him to}} marry Lauretta, daughter of Gianni Schicchi, a newcomer to Florence. Zita replies that if Buoso has left them rich, he can marry whom he pleases; she and the other relatives are anxious to begin reading the will. A happy Rinuccio sends little Gherardino to fetch Schicchi and Lauretta.|$|E
5|$|Bilbo Baggins, the titular protagonist, is a respectable, {{reserved}} hobbit. During his adventure, Bilbo often {{refers to}} the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> larder at home and wishes he had more food. Until he finds a magic ring, he is more baggage than help. Gandalf, an itinerant wizard, introduces Bilbo to a company of thirteen dwarves. During the journey the wizard disappears on side errands dimly hinted at, only to appear again at key moments in the story. Thorin Oakenshield, the proud, pompous head of the company of dwarves and heir to the destroyed dwarvish kingdom under the Lonely Mountain, makes many mistakes in his leadership, relying on Gandalf and Bilbo {{to get him out}} of trouble, but he proves himself a mighty warrior. Smaug is a dragon who long ago pillaged the dwarvish kingdom of Thorin's grandfather and sleeps upon the vast treasure.|$|E

5|$|The {{next day}} Archer discovers Robinson packing up the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> locker. He concedes {{that it is}} {{primarily}} an intermix problem, but that the engine could still work. Archer and Robinson then steal the NX Beta, with Tucker in flight control, but it starts to suffer the same issues as the Alpha. As Starfleet security detains Tucker, Archer and Robinson manage to coax the engines towards their goal of warp 2.5. Afterwards, Archer and Robinson are reprimanded by Starfleet, and the Vulcans ground the program for a year, but they eventually confirm that his father's design was sound. Back in the future, Archer launches the charges into the cloud, and T'Pol suggests that it be named after Archer's close friend, Robinson.|$|E
5|$|Leopold {{gave his}} {{mistress}} vast {{sums of money}} by investing large sums in her name or confiding in trustees for her benefit. He also arranged for his two sons to be well provided for after his death. Under Belgian law, his three remaining legitimate children were entitled to a considerable portion of his estate, regardless of the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> will. However, this applied only in Belgium and not abroad; consequently, much of the wealth he distributed for safekeeping was in foreign investments or {{in the shape of}} paintings, bric-a-brac, and art treasures that could be easily converted into cash. Leopold transferred Caroline a fortune in Congo securities, which were added to the already vast sum of six million francs he had previously presented her. Princess Louise soon went after these securities, but with the help of men loyal to the king, Caroline was able to safely spirit away the majority of her wealth to Paris; two of her estates (in Brussels and in France) were boarded up however, disallowing her from entering them.|$|E
5|$|The Gallery’s lack {{of space}} {{remained}} acute in this period. In 1845 a large bequest of British paintings {{was made by}} Robert Vernon; there was insufficient room in the Wilkins building so these were displayed first in Vernon’s town house at No. 50 Pall Mall and then at Marlborough House. The Gallery was even less well equipped for its next major bequest, as J. M. W. Turner was to bequeath the entire <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> studio, excepting unfinished works, to the nation upon his death in 1851. The first 20 of these were displayed off-site in Marlborough House in 1856. Ralph Nicholson Wornum the Gallery's Keeper and Secretary, worked with John Ruskin to bring the bequest together. The stipulation in Turner's will that two of his paintings be displayed alongside works by Claude is still honoured in Room 15 of the Gallery, but his bequest has never been adequately displayed in its entirety; today the works are divided between Trafalgar Square and the Clore Gallery, a small purpose-built extension to the Tate completed in 1985.|$|E

25|$|Ingres died of {{pneumonia}} on 14 January 1867, {{at the age}} of eighty-six, in his apartment on the Quai Voltaire in Paris. He is interred in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris with a tomb sculpted by his student Jean-Marie Bonnassieux. The <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> studio, including a number of major paintings, over 4000 drawings, and his violin, were bequeathed by the artist to the city museum of Montauban, now known as the Musée Ingres.|$|E

Lamarck was buried in a common grave of the Montparnasse cemetery for just five years, according to the grant obtained from relatives. Later the body was dug up along with other remains and was lost. Lamarck's books and the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> home were sold at auction, and his body was buried in a temporary lime-pit.|$|E
25|$|A further investigation, in 2014, {{revealed}} {{that it was}} unlikely he {{had been killed in}} a chariot accident. Scans found that all but one of his bone fractures, including those to his skull, had been inflicted after his death. The scans also showed that he had a partially clubbed foot and would have been unable to stand unaided, thus making it unlikely he ever rode in a chariot; this was supported by the presence of many walking sticks among the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tomb. Instead, it is believed that genetic defects arising from his parents being siblings, complications from a broken leg and his suffering from malaria, together caused his death.|$|E

He also posted pictures and videos from Airsoftspielen, as well as bomb-making videos, on a personal website. Additional photos on the website showed Bosse with a variety of weapons, including a submachine gun, in public. On Sunday evening before the attack, Bosse posted four videos on his website, in which he and another person operated with weapons and explosives. The site was closed immediately after the attack by the North Rhine-Westphalia police, but its contents were copied in response to the closing, being placed on a number of other websites. Bosse had planned the attack extensively, according to <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> diary.|$|E

Marić returned to Switzerland without the child, whose real name and fate are unknown. Einstein probably never saw his daughter.

There is no direct evidence that Sisto ever received the official title before he died in March 1517. Until the death of Julius II, Bainbridge [...] "filled the vacuum, real or in effect, in the protectorship of England".|$|E
