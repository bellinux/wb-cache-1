5|$|Platinum {{is used in}} {{catalytic}} converters, laboratory equipment, electrical <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> electrodes, platinum resistance thermometers, dentistry equipment, and jewelry. Being a heavy metal, {{it leads}} to health problems upon exposure to its salts; but due to its corrosion resistance, metallic platinum has not been linked to adverse health effects. Compounds containing platinum, such as cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin, are applied in chemotherapy against certain types of cancer.|$|E

The monkeys with the joint attention skills showed the imitation of human’s actions. In the current study, we investigated on a monkey whether joint attention ability also facilitated the imitation of human body-movements. Results showed that the monkey being taught eye <b>contact</b> <b>and</b> pointing showed the imitation of human body-movements. These results suggest that the monkeys have basic potential for following another individual’s motion, and that what imitation expresses depends on where the monkeys are paying attention.

5|$|Before the war, New Albany was {{the largest}} city in the state, mainly because of its river <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> {{extensive}} trade with the South. Over half of Hoosiers with over $100,000 lived in New Albany. During the war, the trade with the South came to a halt, and many residents considered those of New Albany as too friendly to the South. The city never regained its stature. It was stilled as a city of 40,000 with its early-Victorian Mansion-Row buildings remaining from the boom period.|$|E

5|$|For {{the march}} itself, Gandhi wanted the strictest {{discipline}} and adherence to satyagraha and ahimsa. For that reason, he recruited the marchers not from Congress Party members, {{but from the}} residents of his own ashram, who were trained in Gandhi's strict standards of discipline. The 24-day march would pass through 4 districts and 48 villages. The route of the march, along with each evening's stopping place, was planned based on recruitment potential, past <b>contacts,</b> <b>and</b> timing. Gandhi sent scouts to each village ahead of the march so he could plan his talks at each resting place, based {{on the needs of}} the local residents.

5|$|In the laboratory, {{platinum}} wire {{is used for}} electrodes; platinum pans and supports are used in thermogravimetric analysis because of the stringent requirements of chemical inertness upon heating to high temperatures (~1000°C). Platinum is used as an alloying agent for various metal products, including fine wires, noncorrosive laboratory containers, medical instruments, dental prostheses, electrical <b>contacts,</b> <b>and</b> thermocouples. Platinum-cobalt, an alloy of roughly three parts platinum and one part cobalt, is used to make relatively strong permanent magnets. Platinum-based anodes are used in ships, pipelines, and steel piers.|$|E

40|$|Drawing on {{intergroup}} <b>contact</b> theory <b>and</b> intergroup threat theory, {{this chapter}} outlines {{the interplay of}} <b>contact</b> <b>and</b> threat in intergroup relations over time and their interactive effects on prejudice. We propose the Temporally Integrated Model of Intergroup <b>Contact</b> <b>and</b> Threat (TIMICAT), which holds that both (positive or negative, direct or indirect) <b>contact</b> <b>and</b> (different types of) threat can vary over time and in relation to one another. The effects of <b>contact</b> <b>and</b> threat on prejudice may be cumulative and additive and this trajectory can be disrupted by salient changes in any temporal element. TIMICAT systematically structures the intergroup context {{in terms of the}} temporal frame for <b>contact</b> <b>and</b> threats (none, past, continuous, discrete, multiple, future). We then provide initial empirical evidence for TIMICAT, using data from majority and minority group perspectives, from different countries. Moreover, a two-year longitudinal study questions the causal direction proposed by intergroup threat theory. Finally, a quasi-experimental study found that threat cannot only be a mediator in the contact-prejudice relationship, but that threat <b>and</b> <b>contact</b> can operate in parallel as independent influences on prejudice. In conclusion, we propose the TIMICAT framework as a novel way to conceptualize the contact-threat-prejudice links and look forward to seeing more research that examines these variables in a temporal and interactive framework...|$|R

5|$|Ruthenium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ru and atomic number 44. It {{is a rare}} transition metal belonging to the platinum group of the periodic table. Like the other metals of the platinum group, ruthenium is inert to most other chemicals. The Baltic German scientist Karl Ernst Claus discovered the element in 1844 and named it after his homeland, Ruthenia. Ruthenium is usually found as a minor component of platinum ores; the annual production is about 20 tonnes. Most ruthenium produced is used in wear-resistant electrical <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> thick-film resistors. A minor application for ruthenium is in platinum alloys and as a chemistry catalyst.|$|E

Silver compounds are used in photographic film and X-rays. Dilute silver nitrate solutions and other silver compounds are used as disinfectants and microbiocides (oligodynamic effect), added to bandages and wound-dressings, catheters, and other medical instruments.|$|E
