5|$|Israel entered one artistic gymnast {{into the}} Olympic competition. Two-time Olympian Alexander Shatilov {{qualified}} and claimed his Olympic {{spot in the}} men's apparatus and all-around events via the Olympic Test Event in Rio de Janeiro by participation. Shatilov participated in both the London and Beijing Olympics. He did not advance following the qualification round in the floor and horizontal bar events due to not achieving eighth place or higher in either. Shatilov's loss in the qualification rounds makes Rio his worst Olympic finish ever. In regards to the loss, he said “things didn’t go as I planned, but that happens in sport and there’s nothing I can do about it. You {{need to know how}} to cope with disappointments and life continues. I trained hard and wanted to have a good competition, but you can’t turn the clock back. I started my floor drill well, but a small mistake <b>cost</b> <b>me</b> and I knew I had no chance after that. I never imagined a scenario like this.” He performed poorly in both the floor and bar routines, scoring 13.5 points in the floor routine, and 14.066 points in the bar routine. The floor exercise was riddled with errors and ended with a landing where it appeared as if he was trying to break a fall.|$|E

500|$|About {{halfway through}} {{the first leg of}} the tour in Europe, Bowie {{discovered}} that the full Spider set was so large that it would not fit in most indoor venues. He said, [...] "It would <b>cost</b> <b>me</b> between $500,000 and $600,000 to alter the sets enough to bring the show indoors. ... I may decide to have a smaller 'indoor' set made somewhere during the tour." [...] He did in fact commission a third slightly smaller set (called the [...] "Junior Bug" [...] set) to be used at indoor venues where the full spider would not fit, such as New York's Madison Square Garden.|$|E

500|$|Pope Pius IX's {{determination}} to keep Edgardo {{developed into a}} strong paternal attachment. According to Edgardo's memoirs, the pontiff regularly spent time with him and played with him; the Pope would amuse the child by hiding him under his cassock and calling out: [...] "Where's the boy?" [...] At one of their meetings, Pope Pius told Edgardo: [...] "My son, you have <b>cost</b> <b>me</b> dearly, and I have suffered a great deal because of you." [...] He then said to others present: [...] "Both the powerful and the powerless tried to steal this boy from me, and accused me of being barbarous and pitiless.

Now if it were meaningless it could be written quickly without thought, without pains, without erudition; but I assure you that these 20 pages now before us [...] <b>cost</b> <b>me</b> twelve hundred hours and an enormous expense of spirit." [...] When the editor of Vanity Fair asked Joyce if the sketches in Work in Progress were consecutive and interrelated, Joyce replied [...] "It is all consecutive and interrelated." ...|$|E

Ramsbottom added, [...] "Tom {{took a lot of}} chances. He took a lot of it [...] I remember him taking a course of strychnine to build up to some big event. He showed me the box, and had to take one every few days." [...] although he implied that other competitors were involved. Lewis recalled Simpson acquiring a small box at their hotel.

500|$|He {{opened his}} {{account for the}} 2008–09 season with a hat-trick in a 4–0 win over Cheltenham Town on 23 August. Stating his future ambitions as playing Championship {{football}} with Oldham, he was offered a new deal at the club on 30 December 2008. He was linked with a move to Doncaster Rovers in January 2009, but stayed put after talks with manager John Sheridan, who insisted Hughes was [...] "very happy" [...] at Oldham. In March 2009 it was widely reported that Hughes {{had been involved in}} a drunken brawl with Sheridan where Hughes was reported to have had him [...] "in a headlock". Sheridan later downplayed the incident as [...] "jovial", saying [...] "people have made things up". Sheridan was sacked, but insisted that the two incidents were not related, as [...] "it was results that <b>cost</b> <b>me</b> the job".|$|E
500|$|Foreigners like Coey {{who volunteered}} for the Rhodesian Army {{received}} the same pay and conditions of service as local regulars. Ideologically and religiously motivated, Coey viewed himself {{as a kind of}} latter-day crusader. He kept a thorough journal of his thoughts and experiences throughout his army service. [...] "I believe God intended me to come here for some purpose," [...] he wrote soon after enlisting. [...] "This action has <b>cost</b> <b>me</b> an Officer's Commission, and ... my citizenship may be revoked, [...] this is the most I can do for my country under the circumstances." [...] He told the historian Gerald Horne that he believed communists had already compromised top levels of the US government, and that by serving in Rhodesia he was helping to unify [...] "his people" [...] against a foreign conspiracy. His religious views also affected his views on Zionism: he believed that the State of Israel's existence prior to the Second Coming of Christ was contrary to scriptural prophecies, and that it should therefore be destroyed.|$|E
500|$|Adams {{never bought}} a slave and {{declined}} on principle to utilize slave labor, saying, [...] "I have, through my whole life, held {{the practice of}} slavery in such abhorrence, that I have never owned a negro or any other slave, though I have lived {{for many years in}} times, when the practice was not disgraceful, when the best men in my vicinity thought it not inconsistent with their character, and when it has <b>cost</b> <b>me</b> thousands of dollars for the labor and subsistence of free men, which I might have saved by the purchase of negroes at times when they were very cheap." [...] Adams generally tried to keep the issue out of national politics, because of the anticipated southern response during a time when unity was needed to achieve independence. He spoke out in 1777 against a bill to emancipate slaves in Massachusetts, saying that the issue was presently too divisive, and so the legislation should [...] "sleep for a time." [...] He also was against use of black soldiers in the Revolution, due to opposition from southerners. Slavery was abolished in Massachusetts about 1780, when it was forbidden by implication in the Declaration of Rights that John Adams wrote into the Massachusetts Constitution. Abigail Adams vocally opposed slavery.|$|E

500|$|When the Beagle {{returned}} on 2 October 1836, Darwin {{was already}} a celebrity in scientific circles, as in December 1835 University of Cambridge Professor of Botany John Stevens Henslow had fostered his former pupil's reputation by giving selected naturalists a pamphlet of Darwin's geological letters. Charles Lyell eagerly met Darwin {{for the first time}} on 29 October, enthusiastic about the support this gave to his uniformitarianism, and in May wrote to John Herschel that he was [...] "very full of Darwin's new theory of Coral Islands, and have urged Whewell to make him read it at our next meeting. I must give up my volcanic crater theory for ever, though it <b>cost</b> <b>me</b> a pang at first, for it accounted for so much... the whole theory is knocked on the head, and the annular shape and central lagoon have nothing to do with volcanoes, nor even with a crateriform bottom.... Coral islands are the last efforts of drowning continents to lift their heads above water. Regions of elevation and subsidence in the ocean may be traced by the state of the coral reefs." [...] Darwin presented his findings and theory in a paper which he read to the Geological Society of London on 31 May 1837.|$|E
500|$|The Broken Ear {{introduced}} the character General Alcazar to the series, {{who went on}} to become a recurring character who appeared in three further Adventures. It was the first in the series to begin and end in Belgium, the first to deal with the hunt for a specific object, and the last in which Tintin is seen taking part in journalistic activity. It was also the first time that the Adventures featured Tintin's flat at 26 Labrador Road, in which Chinese mementos from The Blue Lotus are visible. Influenced by the films of Alfred Hitchcock, Hergé inserted an illustration of himself into the second frame. He also made reference to contemporary news stories in the book, having a radio announcer discuss the ongoing Second Italo-Ethiopian War at the start of the story; this was removed in the colour edition. At the end of the story, Hergé killed off Ramón and Alonso and depicted them being dragged to Hell by devils; the killing of the story's antagonists was something not repeated in future stories. This upset the editors of Cœurs Vaillants, who asked Hergé to change the scene; annoyed at their request, he later commented, [...] "On the surface it <b>cost</b> <b>me</b> nothing, but that kind of addition was really difficult for me." [...] For their serialisation of the story, he replaced that particular frame with one in which Tintin vouchsafed the souls of Ramón and Alonso for God.|$|E
500|$|Napoleon demanded, from {{a highly}} {{superior}} position, peace terms {{in what was}} to be called the Peace of Tilsit (1807). In the midst of these negotiations, the emperor agreed to keep half of Prussia intact. The men were joined by Queen Louise; Frederick William had sent for his wife, then pregnant with her daughter Princess Louise, to beg for a better settlement for Prussia, with Louise advising her husband, [...] "For God's sake no shameful peace... should at least not go down without honor." [...] As the king felt that her presence might put Napoleon in a [...] "more relaxed mood"; Louise reluctantly agreed to meet the emperor at Tilsit, but only to save [...] "her Prussia". Napoleon had previously attempted to destroy her reputation by questioning Louise's marital fidelity, but the queen met him anyway, attempting to use her beauty and charm to flatter him into more favorable terms. Formerly Louise had regularly referred to him as [...] "the Monster", but nevertheless made a request for a private interview with the emperor, whereon she threw herself at his feet; though he was impressed by her grace and determination, Napoleon refused to make any concessions, writing back to his wife Empress Joséphine that Louise [...] "is really charming and full of coquettishness toward me. But don't be jealous...it would <b>cost</b> <b>me</b> too dearly to play the gallant." [...] Napoleon's attempts to destroy Louise's reputation failed however, and they only made her more beloved in Prussia. Queen Louise's efforts to protect her adopted country from French aggression secured for her the admiration of future generations.|$|E

500|$|Teetotal and a non-smoker, O'Hara {{rejected}} the Hollywood party lifestyle, and was relatively moderate in her personal grooming. In her earlier career {{she refused to}} appear to smoke and drink on screen, {{and it was only}} later that she relented to avoid being out of a job. O'Hara was considered to be prudish in Hollywood. Malone wrote that [...] "her attitude towards sex bordered on puritanical at times, which wasn't what one expected from a sex symbol". When asked why she would not pose for scantily clad photographs O'Hara remarked: [...] "I come from a very strict family, and I can't do some of the things other actresses can because my folks in Dublin would think I turned out bad", and in 1948 she stated that she wouldn't be photographed in a bathing suit [...] "Because I don't think I looked like Lana Turner in a bathing suit, frankly. O'Hara later commented that [...] "I'm not prudish but my training was strict". She believed that her squeaky-clean lifestyle took its toll on her career. She once said, [...] "I'm a helpless victim of a Hollywood whispering campaign. Because I don't let the producer and director kiss me every morning or let them paw me they have spread around town that I am not a woman, that I am a cold piece of marble statuary" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't throw myself on the casting couch, and I know that <b>cost</b> <b>me</b> parts. I wasn't going to play the whore. That wasn't me". She vented her frustration on not being given edgier roles in an interview with The Los Angeles Times, saying [...] "Producers look at a pretty face and think: 'She must have got this far on her looks'. Then comes along a girl with a plain face and they think, 'She must be a great actress, she isn't pretty'. So they give her the glamour treatment and the pretty girl gets left behind". O'Hara believed that she missed out on a number of roles in some of the classic black and white films because she aesthetically pictured so well in Technicolor productions. Such was her natural beauty that {{she was one of the}} few actresses in Hollywood during her career to not undergo cosmetic surgery, though she had one crooked tooth which she refused to part with.|$|E
