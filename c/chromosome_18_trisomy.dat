40|$|In {{the course}} of an {{investigation}} aimed at detecting the presence of trophoblastic cells in the endocervical canal of pregnant women between 7 and 17 weeks of gestation, several cases of aneuploidies were observed using a fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) assay.

The aim of our study was to evaluate {{the correlations between the}} screening test results and results of chromosomal analysis on fetal cells. Methods: Amniotic fluid samples from 1159 pregnant women were studied with the rapid FISH method and the cytogenetic analysis (karyotype). The results from both methods were compared. Results: The indications to perform prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis for numerical chromosomal ab-normalities were: abnormal results of double or triple test, advanced maternal age, fetal abnormality detected through ultrasound examination, and positive family history for chromosomal anomalies.

40|$|A {{sample of}} 100 <b>trisomy</b> <b>18</b> conceptuses {{analysed}} separately and {{together with a}} published sample of 61 conceptuses confirms that an error in maternal meiosis II (MII) is the most frequent cause of nondisjunction for <b>chromosome</b> <b>18.</b> This is unlike all other human trisomies that have been studied, which show a higher frequency in maternal meiosis I (MI). Maternal MI <b>trisomy</b> <b>18</b> shows a low frequency of recombination in proximal p and medial q, but not the reduction in proximal q observed in chromosome 21 MI non-disjunction. Maternal MII non-disjunction does not fit the entanglement model that predicts increased recombination, especially near the centromere. Whereas recent data on MII trisomy 21 show the predicted increase in recombination proximally, maternal MII <b>trisomy</b> <b>18</b> has non-significantly reduced recombination. Therefore, chromosome-specific factors must complicate the simple model of susceptible chiasma distributions interacting with age-dependent deterioration of the meiotic mechanism.

40|$|Objective: To present {{prenatal}} diagnosis and molecular cytogenetic characterization of <b>trisomy</b> <b>18</b> in a monozygotic twin pregnancy, with one structurally abnormal living fetus and one intrauterine fetal demise. Case Report: A 38 -year-old woman was referred for amniocentesis at 16 weeks of gestation because of advanced maternal age. Prenatal ultrasound revealed a monozygotic twin pregnancy, with one structurally abnormal living fetus, and one fetal demise. The body structure {{details of the}} dead fetus could not be identified, whereas holoprosencephaly and omphalocele were identified in the living fetus on prenatal ultrasound. Quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction assays using polymorphic DNA markers specific for chromosome 21 and <b>chromosome</b> <b>18,</b> were applied to the uncultured amniocytes in the amniotic cavity of the living fetus and the cultured amniocytes in the amniotic cavity of the fetus with intrauterine fetal demise. The specimen showed a dosage ratio of 2 : 1 (paternal:maternal) for <b>chromosome</b> <b>18</b> -specific markers in both twins. The result was consistent with monozygosity and <b>trisomy</b> <b>18,</b> and the <b>trisomy</b> <b>18</b> was possibly caused by a paternal second meiotic division non-disjunction error or a postzygotic mitotic error. Conventional cytogenetic analysis revealed a karyotype of 47,XY,+ 18 in both twins. The pregnancy was terminated at 19 weeks of gestation, and a 2  g small-for-date macerated twin A and a 166  g malformed twin B were delivered. Twin A manifested cebocephaly and omphalocele, and twin B manifested premaxillary agenesis and omphalocele. Conclusion: The present case provides evidence that fetal wastage may occur {{in one of the}} co-twins in monozygotic twins associated with <b>trisomy</b> <b>18,</b> and this may in part explain the very rare occurrence of living monozygotic twins with <b>trisomy</b> <b>18...</b>|$|R

MethodsA careful overview of recent works concerning <b>chromosome</b> <b>18</b> aberrations and epilepsy has been carried out considering the major groups of chromosomal 18 aberrations, identified using MEDLINE and EMBASE database from 1980 to 2015. ResultsEpilepsy seems to be particularly frequent in patients with trisomy or duplication of <b>chromosome</b> <b>18</b> with a prevalence of up to 65 %.

Patients with 18 pDS had neither epilepsy nor EEG anomalies; four patients with 18 qDS had epilepsy with partial seizures occurring during infancy or early childhood. Partial seizures were also present in both patients with <b>trisomy</b> <b>18</b> p. By contrast, mixed seizures were observed in the patient carrying a translocation between <b>chromosomes</b> 17 and <b>18.</b> Our data and a re-evaluation of the literature suggest that epilepsy is infrequent in patients with 18 pDS.

40|$|Gastric MALT {{lymphoma}} is {{a distinct}} entity related to Helicobacter pylori gastritis. Some studies suggest a role for trisomy 3 in the genesis of these lymphomas, but they mainly focused on low-grade MALT lymphoma. Gastric MALT lymphoma, however, comprises a spectrum from low- to high-grade cases. Furthermore, its exact relation to primary diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of the stomach is not clear. We applied in situ hybridisation (ISH) with centromeric probes on 43 samples of 39 patients with primary gastric lymphoma (13 samples with low-grade MALT lymphoma, 25 with high-grade MALT lymphoma and five with DLBCL) to detect numerical aberrations of 10 chromosomes. ISH was performed immunohistochemically on nuclei isolated from paraffin-embedded resection tissue and on whole paraffin sections using immunofluorescence. In six of 13 low-grade MALT lymphomas trisomy was detected (46 %) and mostly involved chromosome 3 (33 %). In high-grade MALT lymphomas, trisomies were found in 16 of 25 cases (64 %), mainly involving <b>chromosomes</b> 12 and <b>18.</b> <b>Trisomy</b> 3 was present in only 13 % of these cases.

In lymphomas with separate low- and high-grade tumour components some trisomies were detected in both components, whereas others occurred only in the high-grade tumour cells. This supports the hypothesis that high-grade MALT lymphomas can develop from a low-grade type and that this progression is accompanied by the acquisition of more genetic aberrations.

FISH was similarly used to precisely define the translocation breakpoint on <b>chromosome</b> <b>18,</b> and to identify both YAC and cosmid clones spanning the translocation breakpoint on <b>chromosome</b> <b>18.</b> Physical mapping and sequence analysis of the breakpoint region indicates that the break lies within an L 1 repetitive element. In addition, sequence analysis has enabled the identification of potential coding regions surrounding the break on <b>chromosome</b> <b>18.</b> One of these regions has been used to a isolate a partial cDNA from a brain stem cDNA library. ^ The molecular cytogenetic determination, by FISH, of the extent of <b>chromosome</b> <b>18</b> duplication in six individuals with partial duplication of <b>chromosome</b> <b>18</b> has also been carried out. These six individuals exhibit varying degrees of severity of the classic Edward 2 ̆ 7 s syndrome (<b>Trisomy</b> <b>18)</b> phenotype. The correlation of patient phenotype with the molecularly defined region of duplication in these cases, combined with four previously reported cases, has provided evidence for the presence of two noncontiguous regions on <b>chromosome</b> <b>18</b> q critical to the Edward 2 ̆ 7 s syndrome phenotype. A proximal critical region appears to lie within 18 q 12. 1 - 21. 2 and a distal critical region within 18 q 22. 3 -qter. In addition, preliminary phenotypic mapping of individual features suggests that severe mental retardation may be associated with duplication of the region 18 q 12. 3 -q 22. 1. ^ FISH analysis has provided a rapid and accurate means to define these <b>chromosome</b> <b>18</b> abnormalities. The initial molecular characterization of these abnormalities will lay the groundwork for the positional cloning of relevant gene(s) on <b>chromosome</b> <b>18.</b> ...|$|R

Clinical evaluation revealed dysmorphic facial features, microbrachycephaly, camptodactyly, clinodactyly, abnormal dermatoglyphics and severe mental handicap. Cardiovascular system examination was normal. Chromosomal analysis revealed a <b>trisomy</b> of <b>Chromosome</b> <b>18.</b> The phenotype of <b>trisomy</b> <b>18</b> and the rarity of prolonged survival in this case are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{localization}} of <b>chromosome</b> <b>18</b> {{in human}} interphase nuclei {{is demonstrated by}} use of radioactive and nonradioactive in situ hybridization techniques with a DNA clone designated L 1. 84. This clone represents a distinct subpopulation of the repetitive human alphoid DNA family, located in the centric region of <b>chromosome</b> <b>18.</b> Under stringent hybridization conditions hybridization of L 1. 84 is restricted to <b>chromosome</b> <b>18</b> and reflects the number of these chromosomes present in the nuclei, namely, two in normal diploid human cells and three in nuclei from cells with <b>trisomy</b> <b>18.</b> Under conditions of low stringency, cross-hybridization with other subpopulations of the alphoid DNA family occurs in the centromeric regions of the whole chromosome complement, and numerous hybridization sites are detected over interphase nuclei. Detection of chromosome-specific target DNAs by non-radioactive in situ hybridization with appropriate DNA probes cloned from individual chromosomal subregions presents a rapid means of identifying directly numerical or even structural chromosome aberrations in the interphase nucleus. Present limitations and future applications of interphase cytogenetics are discussed. ...|$|R
25|$|A small {{percentage}} of cases occur when {{only some of the}} body's cells have an extra copy of <b>chromosome</b> <b>18,</b> resulting in a mixed population of cells with a differing number of chromosomes. Such cases are sometimes called mosaic Edwards syndrome. Very rarely, a piece of <b>chromosome</b> <b>18</b> becomes attached to another chromosome (translocated) before or after conception. Affected individuals have two copies of <b>chromosome</b> <b>18</b> plus extra material from <b>chromosome</b> <b>18</b> attached to another chromosome. With a translocation, a person has a partial <b>trisomy</b> for <b>chromosome</b> <b>18,</b> and the abnormalities are often less severe than for the typical Edwards syndrome.|$|R
