40|$|Proteomic {{analysis}} of the hemocytic proteins of Penaeus monodon (Pm) has previously shown that alpha- 2 -macroglobulin (A 2 M) was among the proteins that showed substantially altered expression levels upon Vibrio harveyi infection. Therefore, in this study its potentially {{important role in the}} response of shrimp to bacterial infection was further characterized. The yeast two-hybrid system revealed that the receptor binding domain of PmA 2 M interacted with the carboxyl-terminus of {{one or both of the}} transglutaminase type II isoforms, which are key enzymes involved in the shrimp clotting system. In accord with this, PmA 2 M was found to be localized on the extracellular blood clots and to colocalize with <b>clottable</b> <b>proteins.</b> RNA interference (RNAi) -mediated knockdown of A 2 M transcript levels reduced the PmA 2 M transcript levels (, 94 %) and significantly reduced the bacterial seizing ability of the clotting system, resulting in an up to 3. 3 -fold higher number of V. harveyi that systemically disseminated into the circulatory system at 5 min post-infection before subsequent clearance by the immune system. Furthermore, an appearance of PmA 2 M depleted clots in the presence of V. harveyi strikingly demonstrated fibrinolysis zones surrounding the bacteria. This study provides the first evidence of the vital role of PmA 2 M in enhancing bacterial sequestration by protecting blood clots against fibrinolysis...|$|R
40|$|Hypothesis :An investigational {{surgical}} {{fibrin sealant}} (Crosseal; American Red Cross, Washington, DC) composed of human <b>clottable</b> <b>proteins</b> and human thrombin {{is more effective}} than standard topical hemostatic agents in reducing the time required to achieve hemostasis after liver resection. Design Prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Setting Fifteen major referral centers in the United States and the United Kingdom. Methods After liver resection using standard surgical techniques, 121 patients seen between May 1999 and May 2000 were randomized to treatment with a 2 -component fibrin sealant (n= 3 D 58) or to standard topical hemostatic agents, used singly or in combination (n= 3 D 63). Up to 10 mL of Crosseal was administered by a spray applicator, as recommended by the manufacturer, whereas agents used in the control group were applied according to their instructions for use. Main Outcome Measures The primary outcome measured was time to hemostasis. Secondary outcomes measured included blood loss between application of the hemostatic agent and closure of the abdomen, duration of postoperative biliary drainage, and the occurrence of complications, defined a priori as reoperation for any reason, development of abdominal fluid collections, or bilious appearance of drained fluid for at least 1 day postoperatively. Results: The mean time to hemostasis was 282 seconds with Crosseal, compared with 468 seconds with standard agents (2 -sided; P = 3 D. 06), for the 116 efficacy-evaluable patients. Hemostasis was achieved within 10 minutes in 53 patients (91. 4 %) treated with the study fibrin sealant and in 44 control patients (69. 8 %) (2 -sided; P = 3 D. 003). Intraoperative blood loss was similar in the 2 groups. In the Crosseal group, the percentage of patients developing postoperative complications was 17. 2 %, compared with 36. 5 % in the control group (2 -sided; P = 3 D. 02). Conclusions: Compared with the use of standard topical hemostatic agents, Crosseal fibrin sealant significantly reduced the time to achieve hemostasis following liver resection.

40|$|Fibrinogen, a <b>clottable</b> plasma <b>protein,</b> agglutinates both prokaryotic cells (e. g., staphylococci) and {{eukaryotic}} cell fragments (e. g., platelets) through interaction with specific receptors. To identify {{the region of}} the fibrinogen molecule responsible for its interaction with human platelets, we prepared polypeptide chain subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma) of human fibrinogen by reduction and carboxymethylation. A mixture of the chains induced aggregation (clumping) of human platelets separated from plasma proteins and treated with ADP. When individual chains of fibrinogen were tested, gamma-chain multimers caused platelet aggregation at a molar concentration comparable with that of intact human fibrinogen. The beta chain remained inactive, and the alpha chain was 1 / 4 th to 1 / 5 th as reactive as the gamma chain. Monospecific antibody fragments against the gamma chain inhibited binding of 125 I-labeled fibrinogen to the human platelet receptor and blocked aggregation of platelets induced by ADP in the presence of fibrinogen or gamma-chain multimers. These results indicate that the gamma chain of human fibrinogen bears the main site for interaction with the platelet receptor...|$|R

40|$|The {{growth of}} the {{freshwater}} prawn industry has not reached its great heights compared to the marine shrimps because of agriculturistsâ innate fear of disease that will hamper the {{growth of the}} industry. High concentrations of infectious microorganisms (yeast, viruses and bacteria) in crustaceans during hot and cool seasons have resulted in a huge decline in prawn farming. Vibriosis, early mortality syndrome (EMS) and gastroenteritis due to zoonotic outbreaks have been a major threat to the rapid expanding production of freshwater prawns. The innate immune defense which leads to a lot of possible solutions needs to be thoroughly investigated for in-depth understanding of the defense mechanism of these prawns. This thesis investigates one of them namely the coagulation cascade which is a key mechanism in the invertebrate immune defense for avoiding loss of hemolymph particularly the clotting protein which activates a concatenate enzymatic reaction with the proPO system which leads to the production of the black-brownish pigments called melanin. In the current study, the putative clotting protein gene (CP gene) was sequenced from the fresh-water prawn transcriptome unigenes using Illuminaâs Solexa sequencing technology. The putative clotting protein gene consisted of 5609 base pair with an open reading frame (ORF) length of 5139 bp. Putative CP encoded polypeptide has an estimated molecular mass of 189. 9 k Da and 1712 amino acids with a predicted isoelectric point of 5. 44. The deduced amino acid sequences of the clotting protein gene were aligned with other CP family members indicating the highest sequence similarity with A 7 YIH 6 (Penaeus japonicus <b>clottable</b> <b>protein),</b> B 5 KMA 2 (Penaeus monodon <b>clottable</b> <b>protein),</b> Q 9 U 572 (Penaeus monodon hemolymph <b>clottable</b> <b>protein),</b> A 8 DR 94 (Litopenaeus vannamei hemolymph <b>clottable</b> <b>protein)</b> and Q 9 UAR 3 (Pacifastacus leniusculus clotting protein). DNAstar protein analysis showed that M. rosenbergii CP is a protein with a hydrophilic structure and good antigenicity index. Analysis using PROSITE to identify the domains on the CP protein showed that positions 81 to 782 corresponds to the vitellogenin domain and positions from 1439 to 1635 correspond to the VWFD domain. NeiborâJoining phylogenetic tree of Clotting protein based on the vitellogenin domain of organism group ranging from invertebrate to vertebrate constructed on the basis of Poisson model and built at a boot strap of 1000. The tree represents tr_Q 9 UAR 3 (Pacifastacus leniusculus clotting protein) as the closest ancestral protein. The results of the relative real-time PCR analysis clearly showed that CP expression occurs predominantly in most tissues of Macrobrachium rosenbergii but with remarkably highest expression in stomach followed by in pleopods. According to the outcome of the gene expression analysis, the mRNA transcription of the clotting protein gene in Vibrio parahaemolyticus challenged Macrobrachium rosenbergii was significantly induced in the stomach. The overall results of the current study indicate that the CP is without doubt an essential immune gene involved in the immune response against V. parahaemolyticus infection in Macrobrachium rosenbergii...|$|E

Values for I decreased rapidly. Values for Ill and IV generally paralleled those for I, values for Ill lacked adequate sensitiv-ity. II, low initially, increased to 80 mg/L in 1 - 2 h.

40|$|Fibrinogen {{is a large}} {{heterogeneous}} {{family of}} closely related molecules consisting of three pairs of non-identical polypeptide chains: two Aa-, two Bfi- and two y-chains, held together by disulphide bridges. The heterogeneity of fibrinogen is due to heterogeneities in all three chains. Four main types of assay are used to determine fibrinogen: clotting rate (Clauss), <b>clottable</b> <b>protein,</b> precipitation and immunological assays. Heterogeneities may differ {{from person to person}} and may affect the apparent fibrinogen concentrations in different assays. A further complicating factor was, until recently, the lack of an international fibrinogen standard. The ratio of Clauss: enzyme immunoassay (ElA) for high + low molecular weight fibrinogen decreases during therapy for acute myocardial infarction and increases again after thrombolytic therapy to above normal values. Furthermore, high molecular weight fibrinogen tends to clot more easily than low molecular weight fibrinogen. This suggests that high molecular weight fibrinogen might be associated with increased thrombotic risk. Fibrinogen assessed by a functional assay (Clauss) alone is strongly associated with ischaemic heart disease. Although not proven, it is conceivable that a fibrinogen with a Clauss:El A ratio of>l has an even stronger association in epidemiological studies...|$|E
40|$|Eighty-three hospitalized {{patients}} {{suspected of having}} serious infections were studied {{for the presence of}} circulating endotoxin; the limulus lysate test was used. Although 39 patients in this group were infected with organisms capable of re-leasing endotoxin into the circulation, only two patients had a positive test. Since the test had to be repeated several times before endotoxin was detected in the two positive cases and since the diagnosis could have been established with blood cultures alone in one of these patients, our results cast serious doubt on the usefulness of the limulus test as a diagnostic aid. Although it is widely assumed that endotoxin is the cause of many of the abnormal changes ob-served in severe infections with gram-negative bac-teria, there is still some doubt regarding this con-cept. Moreover, in patients with bacteremia or circulatory collapse due to infection with this type of organism, endotoxin is not found uniformly. This study was undertaken to provide additional information with respect to the routine diagnostic value of the limulus test in patients with suspected sepsis and to further clarify the role of endotoxin in human infections. Materials and Methods The limulus test for endotoxin was performed on samples of blood from 83 {{hospitalized patients}} suspected of having serious bacterial infection.

40|$|Tachypleus tridentatus {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} phylogenetically intact marine {{invertebrates}} known. Its blood cell contains a kind of protein which is clotted by bacterial endotoxin. The cell lysate was extracted by pyrogen-free distilled water from the cells according to the method of Reinhold and his co-workers. The cell lysate was gelated by a minute amount of endotoxin. This gelation reaction proved to be a useful method for detection of endotoxin. The studies of Tachypleus tridentatus blood cell lysate were as follows : 1) The lysates were assayed with E. coli 0127 : B 8 & Serratia marcescens lipopolysaccharide B from Difco Laboratories. The lysates showed a high sensitivity a clearly detected 0. 0005 to 0. 008 Î¼g/m? of endotoxin. 2) The gelation reaction was dependent on the endotoxin concentration and incubation time. The difference was demonstrated in the gelation activity for the lysate between E. coli and Serratia marcescens endotoxin. 3) The sensitivity of the lysate decreased in storage of over a year at ? 20 â. Minimal detectable endotoxin by the aging lysates was from four to twelve times lesser than that of fresh lysate. 4) An inhibitor in human or rabbit plasma which inhibited the reaction of the lysate and endotoxin was noted. To eliminate the inhibitor, the plasma was treated by various methods, such as chloroform extraction, heating at 60 ã¼C for 30 minutes, ether treatment or pH adjustment. However none of the methods could eliminate the inhibitor completely. In these methods, relatively better gelation was demonstrated by the heating method. 5) The <b>clottable</b> <b>protein</b> in the lysate was 30 percent of total protein. An increase in optical density of the lysate was dependent on the endotoxin concentration and was clearly related to the grade of gelation. 6) Actinomycin D was capable of enhancing the lethality of endotoxin in ICR mice by 100, 000 fold. This procedure appeared to detect as little as 0. 01 to 0. 001 ug endotoxin in saline. But it was difficult to detect plasma endotoxin by this procedure.

40|$|Fibrinolytic {{phenomenon}} {{is attributed to}} an increase of plasmin which is activated by the system of proactivator and activator. The fibrin plate method, which is widely used at present {{for the purpose of}} measuring plasmin, has some disadvantages when quantitative measurement of a very small amount of plasmin is required. In this report, the fibrin tube method which was newly devised for the purpose of titrating a very small amount of plasmin is described. Moreover, plasma plasmin in normal healthy persons and that of patients with various diseases was measured by this new method and a relation between diseases and their plasmin value is discussed. Thus, in order to appreciate the property of serum and tissue activators, we tried to separate and extract activators from human serum and tissues. After the measurement method of the tissue activators was examined, the value of activator was determined concerning cancer tissues and mucosae of gastric ulcer obtained from the surgical specimens, and gastric mucosae and various organs from sudden death cadavers. Finally, the corresponding relationship between the activator value and the plasmin value is discussed. I. Fibrin-Tube Method. (1) The fibrin obtained from various animals was examined first. The coagulating conditions of the fibrin incubated for 18 hrs. at 37 â. was investigated, and it was found that bovine fibrin was most available in the bovine, canine, pig 2 Ì 7 s and rabbit 2 Ì 7 s fibrin. (2) Astrup 2 Ì 7 s fibrin plate method was then examined. Conditions of fibrinolysis of the plate colored with carmin suspension were investigated, and four types of fibrinolysis could be differentiated in consequence. 1) Type I : Saucer form- the lysis which does not reach {{to the base of the}} petri dish. 2) Type II : Crater form- the lysis reaches to the base of the petri dish, but the area of lysis is narrower at the base than at the surface. 3) Type III : Complete form- the lysis reaches to the base of the petri dish, and the area of the base is equal to that of the surface. 4) Type IV : Triangle flask form- the lysis reaches to the base of the petri dish, but the area of lysis is larger at the base than at the surface. These four types of lysis could not be differentiate by the non-colored plat method of Astrup 2 Ì 7 s. At the time of practical measurement of the lysed area, the value varied in how to decide the lysed diameter. In the case of type I, particularly, the quantitative measurement of plasmin became impossible. (3) For the purpose of quantitative measurement of plasmin, especially that of low activity such as in healthy normal persons, the fibrin tube method was devised in this report. A mass of fibrin colored with carmin was prepared in glass tubes which had a constant inner diameter, and the material to be measured was piled on the mass. The lysed distance was then measured after incubation. As a result of this examination under various conditions, the following was adopted in this report : a <b>clottable</b> <b>protein</b> concentration of 400 mg/dl; the volume of material used was 1. 0 ml; and measurement of the lysed distance was done after incubation for 18 hrs. at 37 â. The fibrin tube method could be compared with the fibrin plate method by means of multiplying the certain conistants. (4) Lastly, the heated fibrin tube method was attempted. The water bath for 10 minutes at 55 â. was most convenient, because of less degeneration of the fibrin, and satisfactory inactivation of the plasmin in the fibrin mass. II. Comparison of the Plasma Plasmin Value Between Healthy Normal Persons, and Patients with Various Diseases Using the Fibrin Tube Method.
