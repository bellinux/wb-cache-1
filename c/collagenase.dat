Delivered this way, the enzyme solution causes distension of the pancreas, which is subsequently cut into small chunks and transferred into so-called Ricordi's chamber, where digestion takes place until the islets are liberated and removed from the solution. Isolated islets are then separated from the exocrine tissue and debris in a process called purification.|$|E

40|$|From Introduction: <b>Collagenases</b> are enzymes {{capable of}} {{specifically}} attacking the native collagen helix under non-denaturing conditions at physiological conditions of pH, temperature and salt concentration. They are active only on collagen or its breakdown products and are without effect {{on any other}} fibrous or globular protein. In the laboratory, <b>collagenases</b> are used in investigations of the biosynthesis of collagen and for structural and immunochemical studies of collagens and collagen-like proteins; also they are proving their worth as agents for facilitating tissue transplantation and for cell-dispersion in tissue cultures. Established clinical applications of <b>collagenases</b> include the treatment of burns and dermal lesions; in addition they are being evaluated as agents {{for the removal of}} undesirable tissues such as herniated intervertebral discs and the sloughs resulting from cryogenic or cauterizing procedures. Moreover, as human <b>collagenases</b> are implicated in various pathological disorders involving connective tissue degradation, the roles played by these <b>collagenases</b> are being investigated in the hope of finding ways to arrest, control or treat the diseases...|$|R

The effect of two MMP <b>collagenases,</b> MMP- 1 and MMP- 13 on alveolar epithelial repair was studied in vitro. The A 549 alveolar epithelial cell line and primary rat alveolar epithelial cell cultures were used. Cell adhesion and cell migration were measured with and without exogenous MMP- 1. Wound healing of a cell monolayer of rat alveolar epithelial cell after a mechanical injury was evaluated by time lapse video analysis. Cell adhesion on type I collagen, as well as cytoskeleton stiffness, was decreased {{in the presence of}} exogenous <b>collagenases.</b> A similar decrease was observed when cell adhesion was tested on collagen that was first incubated with MMP- 1 (versus control on intact collagen). Cell migration on type I collagen was promoted by <b>collagenases.</b> Wound healing of an alveolar epithelial cell monolayer was enhanced in the presence of exogenous <b>collagenases.</b> Our results suggest that <b>collagenases</b> could modulate the repair process by decreasing cell adhesion and cell stiffness, and by increasing cell migration on type I collagen. Collagen degradation could modify cell adhesion sites and collagen degradation peptides could induce alveolar type II pneumocyte migration.

40|$|Introduction & Objective: Isolation {{of cells}} from {{different}} tissues rely on proteolytic enzymes mainly <b>collagenases</b> that selectively digest collagen fibers of extra-cellular matrix. It {{is important to}} find new and proper <b>collagenases</b> from plant sources. In the present research actinidin, a cysteine protease abundant in Kiwifruit, was used to isolate and culture of rat hepatocytes. Materials & Methods: Different concentrations of actinidin was used to isolate rat hepatocytes by one or two-step perfusion method. The viability of the separated cells was examined by the trypan blue test. The isolated rat hepatocytes were cultured on collagen coated plates in William´s E medium. The morphology of hepatocytes was examined microscopically after staining with the Papanicolaou method. Results: Actinidin in the concentration of 0. 4 mg/ml in two-step perfusion method properly isolated hepatocytes from rat liver. The viability of isolated hepatocytes that successfully cultured in collagen coated plates was 90 - 95 percent. Conclusion: These results showed that actinidin is a proper protease for isolation of hepatocytes. In addition, purification of this enzyme is simpler than the <b>collagenases...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{process that}} degrades bone is {{referred}} to as diagenesis.

Once the collagen has been removed from bone, the hydroxyapatite content is degraded by inorganic mineral weathering, meaning that important ions, such as calcium, are lost to the environment. [...] The strong protein-mineral bond that provided bone with its strength will become compromised by this degradation, leading to an overall weakened structure, which will continue to weaken until full disintegration of bone occurs.|$|R
