5000|$|From 1892 until 1958, it {{was home}} to a popular {{amusement}} park of the same name. From 1904 to 1919, it was called [...] "Steeplechase Island." [...] The amusement park was accessible primarily by ferry service and a wooden swing bridge built in 1927 to carry automobiles and pedestrians. Remaining structures from the amusement park are the carousel, dodge-'em <b>car</b> <b>enclosure,</b> and beer garden (the latter was substantially altered {{for use as a}} summer theater in the 1960s).|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes an {{efficient}} method to extract multiple objects from mobile laser scanning data. The proposed method firstly generates multi-scale supervoxels from 3 D point clouds using colors, intensities and spatial distances. Then, a graph-based segmentation method {{is applied to}} segment the supervoxels by integrating their colors, intensities, normal vectors, and principal directions. Then, the saliency of each segment is calculated and the most salient segment is selected as a seed to cluster for objects clustering. Hence, the objects are classified and the constraint conditions of object's category are included to re-clustering for more accurate extraction of objects. Experiments show that the proposed method has a promising solution for extracting buildings, ground, street lamps, trees, telegraph poles, traffic signs, <b>cars,</b> <b>enclosures</b> and the objects extraction overall accuracy is 92. 3 %...|$|R

40|$|The {{generation}} of personal listening zones {{in a car}} cabin would allow the different occupants to listen to different audio programmes {{without the use of}} headphones. The {{generation of}} independent listening zones has been achieved in a number of applications using loudspeaker arrays and superdirective, or optimal beamforming methods. However, in practice these optimsed arrays are susceptible to robustness issues. In the context of a loudspeaker array designed to provide independent listening zones in the front and rear of a <b>car</b> cabin sized <b>enclosure,</b> this paper presents a comparison between the potential performance and numerical conditioning of a personal audio system optimised using either the acoustic contrast or the least squares optimiatsion method...|$|R
40|$|The {{generation}} of personal listening zones {{in a car}} cabin would allow the different occupants to listen to different audio programmes {{without the use of}} headphones. This would allow, for example, the driver to listen to a navigation system whilst the rear passengers watched a film. Personal audio systems have previously been implemented in mobile devices and monitors, for example, however, the investigation of the effects of an enclosure on the {{generation of}} personal listening zones has been limited. This paper presents an investigation of the effects of a <b>car</b> cabin sized <b>enclosure</b> on the generation of independent listening zones in the front and rear seats. The standard car audio loudspeaker array is used to produce independent listening zones at low frequencies, while a second array of small loudspeakers positioned at the four headrest positions is used to provide control over the rest of the audio bandwidth. The proposed arrays are implemented in a real car and the results of a real-time implementation are presented. <br/...|$|R
