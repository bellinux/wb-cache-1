5|$|Ficus rubiginosa {{was first}} {{cultivated}} in the United Kingdom in 1789, {{where it is}} grown in glasshouses. It is commonly used as a large ornamental tree in eastern Australia, in the North Island of New Zealand, and also in Hawaii and California, where it is also listed as an invasive species in some areas. It is useful as a shade tree in public parks and on golf courses. Not as prodigious as other figs, F. rubiginosa is suited to slightly more confined areas, such as lining car parks or suburban streets. However, surface roots can be large and intrusive and the thin bark readily damaged when struck. Tolerant of acid or alkaline soils, it is hardy to US Hardiness Zones 10B and 11, reaching 10m (35ft) high in 30 years. Planting trees 8–12m (30–40ft) apart will eventually result in a <b>continuous</b> <b>canopy.</b> The trees are of great value in providing fruit for birds and mammals, though drop large quantities of fruit and leaves, leaving a mess underfoot.|$|E

I also investigated the relation of rate of species richness increase with area in different communities to substrate properties and cover of alpine dwarf pine Pinus pumila. Fellfield plant communities on fine gravel habitats had lower coverage and fewer species than communities on large gravel habitats. The plant community where P. pumila was distributed patchily had the lowest number of species per m^ 2 but the fastest rate of species richness increase with area. The plant community where P. pumila had developed <b>continuous</b> <b>canopies</b> was mostly composed of species usually found in the alpine-subalpine and lowland zones, whose seeds are dispersed by birds and mammals.

40|$|Abstract: Life {{history and}} {{recruitment}} information of tropical trees in natural populations is scarce even for important commercial species. This {{study focused on}} a widely exploited Neotropical canopy species, Pachira quinata (Malvaceae), at the southernmost, wettest limit of its natural distribution, in the Colombian Amazonia. We studied phenological patterns, seed production and natural densities; assessed the importance of seed dis-persal and density-dependent effects on recruitment, using field experiments. At this seasonal forest P. quinata was overrepresented by large adult trees and had very low recruitment caused by the combination of low fruit production, high seed predation and very high seedling mortality under <b>continuous</b> <b>canopies</b> mostly due to damping off pathogens. There {{was no evidence of}} negative distance or density effects on recruitment, but a clear requirement of canopy gaps for seedling survival and growth, where pathogen incidence was drastically reduced. In spite of the strong dependence on light for survival of seedlings, seeds germinated readily in the dark. At the study site, the population of P. quinata appeared to be declining, likely because recruitment depended on the rare combination of large gap formation with the presence of reproductive trees nearby. The recruitment biology of this species makes it very vulnerable to any type of logging in natural populations. Rev. Biol. Trop. 59 (2) ...|$|R

Based on vegetational and grazer diversity analysis of the La Venta fauna, it has been suggested the ecosystem resembled more that of Africa and Asia than of the modern Neotropics. Research of the paleosols found in various levels within the Honda Group suggests the presence of arid areas in close proximity to pluvial parts.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the validation {{results of the}} InSAR method for determining the forest canopy height, based on TanDEM-X and ALOS PALSAR data. The research conducted on {{the territory of the}} Baikal-Kudara forest area of the Republic of Buryatia (52 ° 10 'N, 106 ° 48 'E). Forest vegetation is represented mainly by conifers – pine, and spruce, with a small admixture of deciduous trees – aspen, birch, etc. The forest vegetation height was determined by subtracting the digital elevation model (DEM) of the digital terrain model (DTM). DEM is built according to the L-band (wavelength of 23. 5 cm) ALOS PALSAR satellite with horizontal co-polarization mode. In the investigation it was assumed that a radar signal of ALOS PALSAR passes all forest thickness and reflected from the underlying surface, made it possible to recover terrain under forest canopy. DTM has been built using the TanDEM-X data (wavelength 3 cm). In this case, it was assumed that the radar echoes scattered from a some virtual phase centers of scattering surface, which characterizes the upper limit of the <b>continuous</b> forest <b>canopy.</b> To check the accuracy of satellite definitions of forest height in study area were made high-precision geodetic measurement of trees heights using electronic total station and the coordinates of geographic control points using differential GPS receivers.

30|$|Excessive {{fuel loading}} {{has become a}} concern in most forest types {{throughout}} the United States, particularly where wildfires were historically frequent. Contemporary ecosystems are highly altered from their historical conditions due to fire exclusion {{over the past century}} (Stanturf et al. 2002). As a result, forests with <b>continuous</b> <b>canopies</b> and sub-canopies developed over previously open grasslands, savannas, and woodlands (Buckner 1983, Dobyns 1983, Denevan 1992, MacCleery 1993, Pyne 1997). Fuel reduction in the southern Appalachian Mountains is challenging because of steep slopes, heavy fuels in some areas created by a lack of fire, and dense ericaceous shrubs (Waldrop et al. 2007). Lightning- and human-caused fires once {{played a significant role in}} determining the species composition and structure of southern Appalachian forests (Delcourt and Delcourt 1997). However, federal and state fire exclusion policies, which began in the early twentieth century, likely reduced plant and community diversity and may have altered fuels (Brose et al. 2002). Prior to fire exclusion, hardwood ecosystems of the region had open canopies, few shrubs, and rich forest floor vegetation (Van Lear and Waldrop 1989), and oak species (Quercus spp. L.) were more common in regeneration than other tree species because of frequent fire (Brose and Van Lear 1998). In the absence of fire, the increase in forest density and structure resulting from succession of pine (Pinus spp. L.)-hardwood woodlands to hardwood-dominated forests, with concomitant ingrowth of flammable understory species such as mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia L.) and rhododendron (Rhododendron spp. L.) cause increased concern for wildfire risk and potential damage from severe fires. Wildfires are a particular concern in the southern Appalachian Mountains because of an ongoing increase in the number of houses and retirement communities (SAMAB 1996).|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 A plant's {{immediate}} neighborhood reflects its realized {{level of}} competitive stress, since competition and natural selection act {{at the individual}} level. In stands with <b>continuous</b> <b>canopies</b> competition for light is the dominant spatial interaction. Over 100 spatially explicit indices {{have been used to}} characterize the local competitive environment in models of individual tree growth. These indices can be divided into those that indirectly characterize the light environment and those that directly characterize the light environment. The three classes of indirect measures are: size-distance, competitive influence zones, growing space and the two classes of direct measures are open sky views and light-interception methods. Studies that have compared the ability of the indirect indices of the light environment have failed to identify a universally superior measure of competition. However, the two direct measures of the light environment have not been included in the comparisons. An examination of the comparative studies showed that most of them identify indices characterizing competition from larger neighbors as superior. This finding leads to the conclusion that competition for light is the dominant spatial interaction in the stands examined. Thus, spatial indices that directly quantify light should explain more variation than those that quantify both above and below ground competition. Light intensity is modeled with the radiation transport equations. SEALS is a program for calculating light intensity in forest stands. It uses the radiation transport equations to model seasonal quantum light flux (SAL). It uses simulated hemispherical photographs to model direct beam light intensity (PCSHS). SAL and PCSHS were compared to three indirect measures of light competition in a planted western hemlock understory and 11 managed Douglas-fir plots. It was found that SAL reduced the residual variation in height growth of understory western hemlock by 48...|$|R
