40|$|Proteinuria {{selectivity}} index {{based upon}} α 2 -macroglobulin or IgM {{is superior to}} the IgG based index in differentiating glomerular diseases. Technical Note. BackgroundThe proteinuria selectivity index (SI) {{may be used to}} describe changes of the glomerular permeability for macromolecules in glomerular diseases. Proteins the size of α 2 -macroglobulin (α 2 M) or IgM cannot normally pass the glomerular barrier, whereas IgG can pass through the large pores of glomerular basement membrane. Comparison of the clearance of the three high-molecular-weight proteins to that of albumin may be useful in characterization and diagnosis of different glomerular diseases as well as in understanding of the permeability characteristics of the glomerular filter. MethodsThree types of SI, each calculated as a ratio of clearance of either IgG, α 2 M or IgM to that of albumin, were measured in 199 proteinuric patients. The patients were subdivided into eight different biopsy-verified glomerular diseases. ResultsTwo diagnoses could be clearly distinguished using SI based on α 2 M (α 2 M SI) or IgM (IgM SI). Both α 2 M SI and IgM SI were significantly lower in minimal change nephropathy and higher in <b>crescentic</b> necrotizing <b>glomerulonephritis</b> than in all the other diagnoses. The SI based on IgG (IgG SI) was less useful in determining specific diagnoses, since patients with minimal change nephropathy could not be distinguished from those with other types of primary glomerulonephritis and patients with <b>crescentic</b> necrotizing <b>glomerulonephritis</b> did not differ from those with diabetic nephropathy.

40|$|Background. The {{recently}} published histopathologic classification of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated glomerulonephritis might greatly {{aid in the}} prognostication of patients {{at the time of}} diagnosis. This study aims to re-evaluate the new classification for its prognostic capacity in an independent Chinese series. Methods. One hundred and twenty-one consecutive patients with ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis, diagnosed in our center from 1997 to 2010, were included in this retrospective study. The renal specimens were reviewed according to the proposed histopathologic classification. The predictive value of the classification for renal outcome and renal response to treatment was analyzed. Results. Thirty-three (27. 3 %), 24 (19. 8 %), 53 (43. 8 %) and 11 (9. 1 %) patients were classified as focal, mixed, crescentic and sclerotic ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis, respectively. The renal biopsy categories correlated with initial serum creatinine and the renal response to treatment (P < 0. 001, P < 0. 01, respectively). The probability of progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) increased with ascending categories of focal, mixed, <b>crescentic</b> and sclerotic <b>glomerulonephritis</b> (P < 0. 01). The patients with focal, mixed and <b>crescentic</b> ANCA-associated <b>glomerulonephritis</b> were all at decreased risk for developing ESRD compared with the patients with in the sclerotic category (P < 0. 05). Conclusions. The proposed classification system was re-evaluated {{for the first time in}} a relatively large and independent series of patients. This system reflects the severity of the initial renal impairment and can predict, at least to some extent, the renal response to treatment. More importantly, it can independently predict renal outcome, in particular development of ESRD...|$|R

SI based on IgG (IgG-SI) was less useful in determining specific diagnoses.

Furthermore, Cr cl decreased more than 30 % in 12 (92 %) out of thirteen patients with high baseline levels of both IgG-SI and IgM-SI compared to three out of thirteen patients with low baseline values of both the indexes. The decline rate of Cr cl correlated significantly to the SI levels but not to the degree of albuminuria. The findings of the study indicate that urinary excretion of high-molecular-weight proteins, and not of albumin, is a potential prognostic marker in proteinuric glomerulopathies and it may also serve as valuable diagnostic aid in these disorders...|$|R

50|$|While the {{mechanism}} of disease {{has yet to be}} fully elucidated, the leading hypothesis is that the process is begun with an autoimmune process of unknown cause that triggers production of p-ANCA. These antibodies will circulate at low levels until a pro-inflammatory trigger — such as infection, malignancy, or drug therapy. The trigger upregulates production of p-ANCA. Then, the large number of antibodies make it more likely that they will bind a neutrophil. Once bound, the neutrophil degranulates. The degranulation releases toxins that cause endothelial injury. Most recently, two different groups of investigators have demonstrated that anti-MPO antibodies alone can cause necrotizing and <b>crescentic</b> <b>glomerulonephritis.</b>|$|E
50|$|MDM2 is also {{required}} for organ development and tissue homeostasis because unopposed p53 activation leads to p53-overactivation-dependent cell death, {{referred to as}} podoptosis. Podoptosis is caspase-independent and, therefore, different from apoptosis. The mitogenic role of MDM2 is also needed for wound healing upon tissue injury, while MDM2 inhibition impairs re-epithelialization upon epithelial damage. In addition, MDM2 has p53-independent transcription factor-like effects in nuclear factor-kappa beta (NFκB) activation. Therefore, MDM2 promotes tissue inflammation and MDM2 inhibition has potent anti-inflammatory effects in tissue injury. So, MDM2 blockade had mostly anti-inflammatory and anti-mitotic effects that can be of additive therapeutic efficacy in inflammatory and hyperproliferative disorders such as certain cancers or lymphoproliferative autoimmunity, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or <b>crescentic</b> <b>glomerulonephritis.</b>|$|E

An extensive workup for underlying lymphoproliferative and autoimmune diseases was also negative. The patient had not been treated with any immunosuppressive therapies for his psoriatic arthritis in the past. He received hourly difluprednate drops for 3 weeks for his uveitis as well as concomitant intravenous pulse dose methylprednisolone followed by prednisone (60 mg daily) and oral cyclophosphamide (150 mg daily) for his glomerulonephritis.

40|$|Glomerulonephritis is {{a common}} cause of end-stage renal failure and a feature of ANCA-associated {{vasculitis}} (AAV). AAV {{is an example of}} a small vessel vasculitis, characterised by inflammation of the endothelium and glomeruli in which the interaction between leukocytes and endothelial cells play a crucial role. Macrophages have been demonstrated to have a critical role during the initiation and progression of glomerulonephritis. Calprotectin (also termed S 100 A 8 /A 9, mrp 8 / 14), is a complex of 2 small calcium binding proteins that is abundantly expressed in neutrophils and monocytes as well as early infiltrating macrophages and is a ligand of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) and the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE). There is growing evidence in animal models and patients with autoimmune diseases, of calprotectin being involved in the inflammatory response, as well as being a marker of activation of innate immunity. I have initially characterised the presence of calprotectin-positive cells in renal biopsies of patients with focal and <b>crescentic</b> AAV <b>glomerulonephritis,</b> therefore linking the presence of these cells with renal outcome. Patients with active AAV have elevated serum calprotectin levels, as well as significant expression on neutrophils and monocytes, which although decrease during remission, does not normalise. I have demonstrated that mrp 14 -/- mice are protected from nephrotoxic nephritis, which is abrogated by use of LPS during disease progression. Bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) release pro-inflammatory cytokines following stimulation with calprotectin; mediated by TLR 4. Mrp 14 -/- BMDMs do not respond to the pro-inflammatory stimulus of S 100 A 8 /A 9. The co-culture of endothelial cells (EC) and wild-type BMDMs is pro-inflammatory unlike that of mrp 14 -/- BMDM and ECs. Mrp 14 -/- mesangial cells also have a decreased pro-inflammatory response. This work demonstrates that calprotectin has a role in experimental glomerulonephritis as well as AAV patients. This may improve our understanding of the inflammatory response and identify a new novel treatment targets...|$|R

HMGB 1 remained higher in inactive cases compared with historic healthy controls (10. 9 ± 10. 5 ng/mL). HMGB 1 levels did not differ significantly between AAV subgroups. CRP and ESR did not correlate with HMGB 1. HMGB 1 is significantly increased in AAV with renal involvement. Residual HMGB 1 elevation in remission could possibly reflect low-grade inflammatory activity or tissue damage. Future studies may further reveal whether HMGB 1 is useful as a marker of disease activity and a predictor of outcome in AAV...|$|R
40|$|<b>Crescentic</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> is {{a severe}} form of glomerular injury that is {{characterized}} by disruption of the glomerular basement membrane, cellular proliferation within Bowman space, and (often) fibrinoid necrosis. Pauci-immune <b>crescentic</b> <b>glomerulonephritis,</b> so called because it involves little or no glomerular immunoglobulin deposition, {{is one of the}} most common causes of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. in the majority of patients, pauci-immune <b>crescentic</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> is a manifestation of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) -associated vasculitis. However, some patients with pauci-immune <b>crescentic</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> lack ANCAs. This review compares the prevalence, clinical manifestations, histopathology, and outcomes of ANCA-negative pauci-immune <b>crescentic</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> with those of ANCA-positive disease. we also discuss the possible pathogenesis of ANCA-negative pauci-immune <b>crescentic</b> <b>glomerulonephritis,</b> paying particular attention to the mechanisms and role of neutrophil activation...|$|E
40|$|Cellular lesions form in Bowman's {{space in}} both <b>crescentic</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> and {{collapsing}} glomerulopathy. The pathomechanism and {{origin of the}} proliferating cells in these lesions are unknown. In this study, we examined proliferating cells by lineage tracing of either podocytes or parietal epithelial cells (PECs) in the nephrotoxic nephritis model of inflammatory <b>crescentic</b> <b>glomerulonephritis.</b> In addition, we traced the fate of genetically labeled PECs in the Thy- 1. 1 transgenic mouse model of collapsing glomerulopathy. In both models, cellular bridges composed of PECs were observed between Bowman's capsule and the glomerular tuft. Genetically labeled PECs also populated larger, more advanced cellular lesions. In these lesions, we detected de novo expression of CD 44 in activated PECs. In contrast, we rarely identified genetically labeled podocytes within the cellular lesions of <b>crescentic</b> <b>glomerulonephritis.</b> In conclusion, PECs constitute the majority of cells that compose early extracapillary proliferative lesions in both <b>crescentic</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> and collapsing glomerulopathy, suggesting similar pathomechanisms in both diseases...|$|E
40|$|There are few clinicopathologic {{and outcome}} data on {{patients}} with crescentic lupus nephritis, therefore, we determined factors {{of the disease}} by retrospectively reviewing the records of 327 patients diagnosed with lupus nephritis. Of these, 152 cases were regrouped as class IV-G, including 33 patients with <b>crescentic</b> <b>glomerulonephritis.</b> Significantly, all patients with <b>crescentic</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> had acute kidney injury as compared with only {{about a quarter of}} the patients without the disease. On pathological evaluation, activity scores, chronicity indexes, relapse rates, and the frequency of positive serum anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) were each significantly higher, whereas complete remission rates and renal outcomes, over a mean follow-up of 4 years, were significantly poorer in patients with <b>crescentic</b> <b>glomerulonephritis.</b> Our study shows that <b>crescentic</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> was not rare in patients with lupus nephritis and that their long-term outcome was poor. The precise role of ANCA in the pathologic course of crescentic lupus nephritis remains to be determined...|$|E

It is a systemic vasculitis that is rarely encountered in children. We present a 14 -year-old girl who suffered from pharyngitis 1 week before admittance to hospital. She was admitted for macroscopic hematuria and oliguria, under the possibility of nephritic syndrome. Renal failure with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis occurred within 24 hours. Immunologic tests showed the presence of type-C anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (c-ANCA with antiproteinase 3 specificity) and renal biopsy revealed pauci-immune <b>crescentic</b> focal necrotizing <b>glomerulonephritis.</b> Treatment including methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide intravenous pulses allowed renal recovery after 3 weeks. The clinical, hematological, and biochemical parameters improved substantially, achieving remission. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, although rare in children, should be considered in the above clinical scenario. This case underlines that knowledge of renal histology diagnosis and early aggressive immunosuppressive therapy are essential for the management of these patients.

40|$|Cetuximab-induced {{nephrotoxicity}} is very rare, {{occurring in}} less than 1 % of colorectal cancer patients and not defined in other populations. We report a rare case of <b>crescentic</b> diffuse proliferative <b>glomerulonephritis</b> (GN) that developed in close temporal association with cetuximab treatment. A 65 -year-old female recently completed chemotherapy with cetuximab treatment for moderately differentiated oral squamous cell carcinoma. She was admitted with acute renal failure and nephrotic-range proteinuria. Laboratory data showed serum creatinine of 6. 6 [*]mg/dl and urinalysis showed proteinuria, moderate hemoglobinuria, hyaline casts (41 /LPF), WBC (28 /HPF), and RBC (81 /HPF). Serologic studies were negative for ANA, anti-GBM, ANCA, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Serum C 3 and C 4 level were normal. Renal biopsy showed crescentic diffuse proliferative GN with focal features of thrombotic microangiopathy. Patient was started on cyclophosphamide and steroids. Her renal function did not improve on day 8 and she was started on hemodialysis. Previous reports suggest that EGFR-targeting medications can possibly trigger or exacerbate an IgA-mediated glomerular process leading to renal failure. This case suggests that cetuximab therapy may have triggered or exacerbated a severe glomerular injury with an unfavorable outcome. Treating physicians should maintain {{a high degree of}} caution and monitor renal function in patients on EGFR inhibitors...|$|R
