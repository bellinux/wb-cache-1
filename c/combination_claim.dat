Sex, age, the stroke type, urinary incontinence, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scales (NIHSS) and the TCT scores (assessed at first and second week post-stroke) as independent variables. Motor function outcome at 6 months after stroke is defined by the use the Rankin score, the motor FIM and the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). Results: Older patients, women and those with initial urinary incontinence and lower TCT and NIHSS scores showed significantly worse motor outcomes at first and six months after the stroke (Rankin, motor FIM and BBS). A multiple regression reveals that only age and the TCT (at 14 days after stroke) accounts for the 61. 1 % {{of the variance in the}} motor FIM score at 6 months after stroke. When the TCT is registered at 7 days after stroke, age and the TCT accounts for the 51. 7 % of the motor FIM variance. A cluster analysis identifies 12 patients with low outcome scores: Rankin 4 - 5, motor FIM Discussion and conclusions: Age, sex, urinary incontinence, TCT and NIHSS scores are related with disability, balance and walking ability six months after the stroke. It is possible to approach to the motor functional outcome at 6 months after stroke by the early use of data easily recorded as age and the TCT. In this study the TCT even overcomes the NIHSS, a comprehensive neurological measure whose ability to predicts outcome has been well documented in stroke patients. The reproducibility of this model must be cross-validated in future studies. The TCT registered at 14 days provides better prediction values compared with those obtained at 7 days after stroke. This study shows that the TCT early administered predicts motor outcome at six months after stroke. EQUILIBRI DE TRONC: PREDICTOR DE LA FUNCIÓ MOTORA EN L'HEMIPLÈGIC VASCULAR RESUM Introducció: La cerca de factors predictors del resultat funcional després de patir un ictus és objecte constant d'investigació en Medicina Física i Rehabilitació. Un pronòstic funcional en fases inicials permet al clínic informar als pacients i a la seva familia, però també establir objectius terapèutics realistes. Molts estudis han avaluat la capacitat predictora de diferents factors individual i combinadament. El Test de Control de Tronc (TCT) registrat a les 6 setmanes de l'ictus és un predictor de la capacitat de marxa a les 18 setmanes. La fiabilitat i validesa del TCT s'ha demostrat en pacients amb ictus, així com la seva correlació positiva amb la discapacitat a l'alta hospitalaria. Un model predictiu que inclou només el TCT i el Functional Independence Measure (FIM) registrats a l'ingrés en la unitat de rehabilitació d'hospitalització aguda prediu el 66. 5 % de la variabilitat del FIM a l'alta. Objectius: Conèixer la relació de les variables predictores amb els resultats de funció motora global al mes i als sis mesos de l'ictus. Construir un model de predicció precoç de la funció motora (discapacitat, capacitat de marxa i equilibri) als 6 mesos, tenint en compte el TCT i altres predictors vàlids avaluats en la primera i en la segona setmana després de patir l'ictus. Pacients i Mètode: estudi longitudinal i prospectiu en 75 pacients consecutius ingressats per un primer episodi d'ictus. Les variables independents van ser: edat, sexe, tipus d'ictus, incontinencia urinària, l'escala d'ictus National Institutes of Health Stroke Scales (NIHSS) i el TCT (recollits en la primera i segona setmanes de l'ictus). Els resultats de funció motora al mes i als 6 mesos de l'ictus es van definir amb l'escala de Rankin, la subescala motora del FIM i l'escala d'equilibri Berg Balance Scale (BBS). Resultats: els pacients de més edat, les dones i els que tenen incontinència urinària inicial i puntuacions més baixes de TCT i NIHSS són els que presenten significativament pitjors resultats de funció motora tant en el primer com en el sisè mes de l'ictus (Rankin, FIM motor i BBS). Una anàlisi de regressió múltipla determina que només amb l'edat i el TCT de la segona setmana s'explica el 61. 1 % de la variabilitat del FIM motor als 6 mesos de l'ictus. Quan el TCT es registra en el setè dia de l'ictus, l'edat i el TCT expliquen el 51. 7 % de la variabilitat del FIM motor. Una anàlisi de conglomerats identifica 12 pacients amb resultats baixos de funció motora: Rankin 4 - 5, FIM motor Conclusions: L'edat, el sexe, la incontinència urinària, el TCT i el NIHSS inicials són factors relacionats amb la discapacitat, equilibri i capacitat de marxa 6 mesos després de l'ictus. És possible aproximar-nos al resultat funcional motor als 6 mesos després de patir l'ictus amb la utilització precoç de dades de fácil recollida com l'edat i el TCT.

Methods: Patent documents were retrieved from the official website of the State Intellectual Property Office of the People's Republic China.

Results: A high number of patents in force included high-frequency herbs such as Salvia miltiorrhiza, Panax ginseng, and Panax notoginseng, as well as high-frequency herbal families such as Araliaceae, Leguminosae, Labiatae, and Umbelliferae. Herb pairs such as P. ginseng + Ophiopogon japonicus, S. miltiorrhiza + Dalbergia odorifera, and P. ginseng + Schisandra chinensis are also commonly used, as well as herbal family pairs such as Araliaceae + Liliaceae, Lauraceae + Leguminosae, and Araliaceae + Schisandraceae. Traditional treatment principles for preventing and treating heart diseases was most-commonly based on simultaneously treating the liver and heart and treating the lung and spleen secondarily for choosing herbal combinations. Conclusion: Most of the high-frequency Chinese herbs in the patents investigated belong to the high-frequency herbal families, and herb pairs were commonly selected {{to coincide with the}} commonly-used herbal family pairs. Low-frequency Chinese herbs were also used, but generally belonged to the high-frequency herbal families, and were therefore similar to the high-frequency herbs in terms of traditional categories of taste and channel entered.

30|$|Another {{feature of}} {{financial}} innovations, {{which seems to}} apply mainly to financial instruments, is their combinatorial nature. By combinatorial, we mean that the underlying structure of financial innovations can consist of a <b>combination</b> of <b>claims.</b> One consequence of this feature is the unbundling of instrument characteristics in ways that allow users of financial innovations (such as investors and borrowers) {{to pick and choose}} features of the instrument they desire (Llewellyn, 1992). Another consequence is the high speed of change in financial innovations by simply making new combinations (Lerner and Tufano, 2011). According to Herrera and Schroth (2004), a financial innovation deal (particularly with credit derivatives) must undergo further incremental changes to meet client specifications and improve product quality. This suggests that financial innovations tend to be adaptive and highly customizable to market needs (Rajan, 2006). It is not clear, however, whether this adaptive nature applies to financial innovation in general or to specific sectors or categories. Zachary (2011) finds that financial innovations that are traded in the market are standardized while those created by banks for their clients could be customized. Although the discussion on incremental innovation, combination, and complexity as a feature of financial innovation appears to relate more to innovations in the products category, Mention and Torkelli (2014) suggest that process innovations could also be incremental in nature.|$|R

Participants were Aetna members ages between 52 and 80 years from 32 primary care practices in Florida and Georgia participating in the Communicating Health Options through Informa-tion and Cancer Education study. Main outcomes were the proportion of average-risk patients who were up-to-date with colorectal cancer screening based on claims data and the estimated additional yield of survey data for patients with no evidence of screening in their claims history.
