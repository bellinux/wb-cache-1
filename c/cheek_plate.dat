This study addressed the different dynamic amplification factors that are adapted in {{the oil and gas}} industry based on different design codes. This study explains the impact of limiting the effective thickness of the <b>cheek</b> <b>plate</b> with respect to the main plate of the padeye and the advantages of increasing the effective thickness of the cheek plates. It also touched on the fabrication requirements to achieve the required effective thickness of the cheek plates. In addition, a sensitivity study about the impact of the out of plane force on the padeye design is addressed and the maximum out of plane angle that shall be considered is recommended. A finite element analysis using London University Structure Analysis System (LUSAS), is conducted and compared with the hand calculation. The benefits and advantage of using FE analysis is addressed in this study. At the end of this research a guideline on the design of the padeye is developed. It has been found that the dynamic amplification factor can be reduced to a lower value of 1. 15 instead of 1. 35. The effective thickness of the <b>cheek</b> <b>plate</b> can be increased to 100 % with proper fabrication and welding sequence.

The Portal Mountain fish fauna, preserved in a finely laminated, non-calcareous siltstone, includes acanthodians, palaeoniscoids, and bothriolepid placoderms. The articulated acanthodian specimens are the most complete fossil fish remains documented {{so far from the}} Aztec assemblage, which is the most diverse fossil vertebrate fauna known from Antarctica. They are described as a new taxon, Milesacanthus antarctica gen. et sp. nov., which is assigned to the family Diplacanthidae. Its fin spines show some similarities to spine fragments named Byssacanthoides debenhami from glacial moraine at Granite Harbour, Antarctica, and much larger spines named Antarctonchus glacialis from outcrops of the Aztec Siltstone in the Boomerang Range, southern Victoria Land. Both of these are reviewed, and retained as form taxa for isolated spines. Various isolated remains of fin spines and scales are described from Portal Mountain and Mount Crean (Lashly Range), and referred to Milesacanthus antarctica gen. et sp. nov. The histology of spines and scales is documented for the first time, and compared with acanthodian material from the Devonian of Australia and Europe. Distinctive fin spines from Mount Crean are provisionally assigned to Culmacanthus antarctica Young, 1989 b.

40|$|International audienceIn the {{pharmaceutical}} industry, the roll compaction {{is part of}} the dry granulation process, densifying fine powders into ribbons that will be later milled to produce granules with good flowability for subsequent die compaction process. Roll compactors are constructed with a sealing system, limiting the loss of powder from the sides. However, the sealing system may result in unwanted non-uniformity of the ribbon's properties. In this work, a 3 D Finite Elements Method (FEM) modeling is used to analyze the roll compaction process and the effect of sealing system designs on the compacted ribbon's density distribution. A density dependent Drucker-Prager Cap (DPC) constitutive model for microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel PH- 101) was calibrated and implemented in Abaqus/Explicit. Two different FEM models were investigated, one with a fixed side sealing called <b>cheek</b> <b>plates</b> and another where the side sealing is integrated with the bottom roll called rimmed-roll. Both numerical and experimental results clearly show the non-uniform roll pressure and density distribution for the <b>cheek</b> <b>plates</b> assembly, whereas the rimmed-roll shows an overall more uniformly distributed resultant pressure and density distribution. These results demonstrate the capability of FEM modeling to provide insight and help achieving {{a better understanding of the}} roll compaction process. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|A {{new species}} of Pseudancistrus is {{described}} from the Tapajós Basin, and assigned to the P. barbatus group byhypertrophied odontodes along the snout and lacking evertible <b>cheek</b> <b>plates.</b> The new species is distinguished from other species in that group (P. barbatus, P. corantijniensis, P. depressus and P. nigrescens) by its pattern of spots, length and color of snout odontodes, greater head depth, cleithral width, anal-fin spine length, peduncle depth and internares width. Molecular phylogenetic results corroborate placement of the new species in the Pseudancistrus barbatus group which is otherwise distributed in the Xingu Basin and rivers draining the Guyana Shield into the Atlantic Ocean. Topology tests strongly reject alternative hypotheses supporting close relationships with Guyanancistrus, Lithoxancistrus or the species Pseudancistrus pectegenitor, P. sidereus and P. genisetiger. Additionally, we propose two hypotheses {{on the distribution of}} the new species in the rio Tapajós, a Brazilian Shield drainage. The first one proposes that ancestral stock of the P. barbatus group was widely distributed throughout rivers draining the Guyana and Brazilian shields, and the species P. zawadzkii and Pseudancistrus sp. L 17 are in the limit of the distribution for the group in Tapajós and Xingu rivers. The second hypothesis proposes that ancestral stock of the P. barbatus group was restricted to Guyana Shield rivers, and that headwater capture events permitted several dispersal routs through Guyana and Amazon rivers, permitted that the ancestral lineages of Pseudancistrus sp.

5000|$|Totila's {{strategy}} was to move fast and {{take control of the}} countryside, leaving the Byzantine forces in control of well-defended cities, and especially the ports. When Belisarius eventually returned to Italy, Procopius relates that [...] "during a space of five years he did not succeed once in setting foot on any part of the land... except where some fortress was, but during this whole period he kept sailing about visiting one port after another." [...] Totila circumvented those cities where a drawn-out siege would have been required, razing the walls of cities that capitulated to him, such as Beneventum. Totila's conquest of Italy was marked not only by celerity but also by mercy, and Gibbon says [...] "none were deceived, either friends or enemies, who depended on his faith or his clemency." [...] After a successful siege of a resisting city, such as at Perugia, however, Totila could be merciless, as Procopius recounts. Procopius also left a word portrait of Totila before his troops drawn up for battle:The armor in which he was clad was abundantly plated with gold and the ample adornments which hung from his <b>cheek</b> <b>plates</b> as well as his helmet and spear were not only purple, but in other respects befitting a king ...

And as he rode he hurled his javelin into the air and caught it again as it quivered above him, then passed it rapidly from hand to hand, shifting it with consummate skill.|$|R
40|$|The {{compression}} behaviour of powders during roller compaction {{is dominated}} {{by a number of}} factors, such as process conditions (roll speed, roll gap, feeding mechanisms and feeding speed) and powder properties (particle size, shape, moisture content). The moisture content affects the powder properties, such as the flowability and cohesion, {{but it is not clear}} how the moisture content will influence the powder compression behaviour during roller compaction. In this study, the effect of moisture contents on roller compaction behaviour of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC, Avicel PHI 02) was investigated experimentally. MCC samples of different moisture contents were prepared by mixing as-received MCC powder with different amount of water that was sprayed onto the powder bed being agitated in a rotary mixer. The flowability of these samples were evaluated in terms of the poured angle of repose and flow functions. The moist powders were then compacted using the instrumented roller compactor developed at the University of Birmingham. The flow and compression behaviour during roller compaction and the properties of produced ribbons were examined. It has been found that, as the moisture content increases, the flowability of moist MCC powders decreases and the powder becomes more cohesive. As a consequence of non-uniform flow of powder into the compaction zone induced by the friction between powder and side <b>cheek</b> <b>plates,</b> all produced ribbons have a higher density in the middle and lower densities at the edges. For the ribbons made of powders with high moisture contents, different hydration states across the ribbon width were also identified from SEM images. Moreover, it was interesting to find that these ribbons were split into two halves. This is attributed to the reduction in the mechanical strength of moist powder compacts with high moisture contents produced at high compression pressures. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Roller {{compaction}} is {{one stage}} in a dry granulation process to produce free flowing granules. Its proper understanding is essential in optimising manufacturing efficiency and product quality. Roller compaction produces a compacted strip or "ribbon", which is then milled to produce granules. For a given milling condition, the density distribution in the ribbons determines {{the properties of the}} granules (particularly their size distribution and strength). Therefore, knowing the density distributions in the ribbons is very important in improving the effectiveness of the roller compaction process {{and the quality of the}} granules produced. In this paper, the density distribution in roller-compacted ribbons of microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel PH 102) has been examined using three different techniques: (1) sectioning; (2) micro-indentation and (3) X-ray micro-computed tomography. It has been shown that with proper calibration all three techniques can essentially produce the same results, but with a different degree of resolution (scale of scrutiny). In addition, the influence of process conditions, such as roll gap, roll speed and the presence or absence of lubrication, on the ribbon density distributions has also been investigated. Flow into the press is often constrained by the presence of "cheek plates", which prevent lateral powder movement. In this type of arrangement, it is found that non-uniform powder feeding occurs in the compaction region, induced by the friction between the powder and the cheek plates: as a result, the densities in the middle of the ribbon width are generally higher than those close to the edges. It has also been shown that higher average ribbon densities are obtained when the roll gap, roll speed, or the friction between the powder and the side <b>cheek</b> <b>plates</b> is reduced.

40|$|Roller {{compaction}} is {{a continuous}} dry granulation process for producing free flowing granules {{in order to}} increase the bulk density and uniformity of pharmaceutical formulations. It is a complicated process due to the diversity of powder blends and processing parameters involved. The properties of the produced ribbon are dominated by a number of factors, such as the powder properties. friction, roll speed, roll gap, feeding mechanisms and feeding speed, which consequently determine the properties of the granules (size distribution, density and flow behaviour). It is hence important to understand the influence of these factors on the ribbon properties. in this study, an instrumented roller press developed at the University of Birmingham is used to investigate the effect of lubrication on the density distribution of the ribbons. Three different cases are considered: (1) no lubrication, (2) lubricated press. in which the side <b>cheek</b> <b>plates</b> of the roller press are lubricated, and (3) lubricated powder, for which a lubricant is mixed into the powder. In addition, how the powders are fed into the entry region of the roller press and its influence on ribbon properties are also investigated. It is found that the method of feeding the powder into the roller press plays a crucial role in determining the homogeneity of the ribbon density. For the roller press used in this Study, a drag angle (i. e., the angle formed when the powder is dragged into the roller press) is introduced to characterise the powder flow pattern in the feeding hopper. It is shown that a sharper drag angle results in a more heterogeneous ribbon. In addition, the average ribbon density depends upon the peak pressure and nip angle. The higher the peak pressure and nip angle are, the higher the average ribbon density is. Furthermore, the densification behaviour of the powder during roller compaction is compared to that during die compaction. It has been shown that the densification behaviour during these two processes is similar if the ribbons and the tablets have the same thickness. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. ...|$|R
