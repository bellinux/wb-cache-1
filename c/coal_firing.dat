To estimate the annual intensity of greenhouse gas emissions {{and the loss of}} coal resources, estimating the annual loss from fire-influenced coal seams is a feasible approach. This study assumes that the primary cause of coal volume loss is subsurface <b>coal</b> seam <b>fires.</b> The main calculation process is divided into three modules: (1) <b>Coal</b> <b>fire</b> quantity calculations, which use change detection to determine the areas of the different <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> stages (increase/growth, maintenance/stability and decrease/shrinkage). During every change detections, the amount of <b>coal</b> influenced by <b>fires</b> for these three stages was calculated by multiplying the coal mining residual rate, combustion efficiency, average thickness and average coal intensity. (2) The life cycle estimate is based on remote sensing long-term <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> monitoring. The life cycles for the three <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> stages and the corresponding life cycle proportions were calculated; (3) The diurnal burnt rates for different <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> stages were calculated using the CO 2 emission rates from spontaneous combustion experiments, the <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> life cycle, life cycle proportions. Then, using the fire-influenced quantity aggregated across the different stages, the diurnal burn rates for the different stages and the time spans between the multi-temporal image pairs used for change detection, we estimated the annual coal loss to be 44. 3 × 103 tons.

40|$|<b>Coal</b> <b>fires</b> {{cause severe}} {{environmental}} and economic problems. Although satellite remote sensing has been used successfully to detect <b>coal</b> <b>fires,</b> a satellite data based concept that can quantify {{the majority of the}} detected <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> is still missing. Recently, the determination of fire radiative energy (FRE) has been introduced as a new remote sensing tool to quantify forest and grassland fires. This thesis tests the concept of remotely measured FRE, with a view to ascertaining its potential applicability to <b>coal</b> <b>fires.</b> It contains an investigation {{of a new generation of}} satellite instruments, including the operational Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) instrument, the experimental Bi-spectral InfraRed Detection (BIRD) satellite sensor and the experimental Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), which explores the potential of these sensors to determine <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> radiative energy (CFRE). Additionally, based on the results of this analysis, the thesis presents a new, automated ETM and ASTER data based algorithm, adapted to quantify <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> in semi-arid to arid regions in northern China. Field observations carried out in September 2002 and 2003 in three coalfields in northern China (the Wuda, Gulaben and Ruqigou coalfields) demonstrate that <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> related, surface anomalies are significantly cooler than forest and grassland fires. The theoretical investigation of the ASTER, ETM and BIRD instruments outlines the fact that the thermal infrared (TIR) or mid infrared (MIR) spectral channels of the ASTER, ETM and BIRD instrument are particularly effective in registering these ‘warm spots’, whilst the short wave infrared (SWIR) spectral range is, however, insufficiently sensitive to be able to register spectral <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> radiances. The commonly used bi-spectral fire quantification method (Dozier, 1981) can be applied to BIRD data in order to quantify relatively large and / or hot <b>coal</b> <b>fires.</b> However, existing FRE retrieval approaches fail to quantify <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> via ASTER and ETM instrument data. In this thesis, a new CFRE retrieval method is presented, which links the fire and background TIR spectral radiances to the CFRE through an empirical relationship. This newly developed TIR method is applied to visually detected fire clusters from night-time ASTER data, and from both day- and night-time ETM data, taken from the three study coalfields in northern China. The ASTER and ETM CFRE values, calculated via the TIR method, are compared to CFRE estimates from BIRD data, calculated via the existing bi-spectral method. Despite the different spatial resolution and spectral properties of the ETM, ASTER and BIRD instruments, CFRE computed from ASTER, ETM and BIRD data show good correlations with one another. However, CFRE retrievals from daytime data appear to be very undependable to background temperature variations, while CFRE, estimated from night-time data, appears to be relatively stable. A comparison between night-time ETM-derived CFRE and the figures given by local mining authorities for total <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> induced, <b>coal</b> loss estimates in the Wuda coalfield gives a clear indication that the overall dimension of the <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> problematic can in fact be approximated via satellite data CFRE retrievals. It is thus expected that CFRE derived from night-time satellite data will become a crucial tool in obtaining reliable, quantitative information for <b>coal</b> <b>fires.</b> A multi-temporal comparison of CFRE retrievals from night-time BIRD and ETM data, covering the Ruqigou and Wuda coalfields, indicates that only major shifts or activity changes in <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> induced, surface anomalies can be observed by means of these data. These results, which could only partially be verified by field observations, indicate that ETM or BIRD data can be used to monitor major changes in <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> related, surface anomalies. These data however cannot entirely replace detailed field observations, especially in case of smaller and / or cooler <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> related, surface anomalies...|$|R

40|$|The {{mission of}} the <b>Coal</b> <b>Fire</b> Gang (CFG) is to spread {{awareness}} about the global issue of uncontrolled <b>coal</b> <b>fires,</b> and to highlight them as a low-hanging fruit of immediate emissions reduction. This report summarizes CFG’s research for the WERC competition, for which this topic was chosen as an open task. Beyond raising awareness, CFG modeled, developed and built an experimentation apparatus meant to prove the validity of a relatively cheap extinguishing method which was also novel to the regions in which it could be employed. The apparatus, which simulated an underground <b>coal</b> <b>fire,</b> {{was used to test}} a sand and water extinguishing method. CFG’s results on the experimental research side suggest that the sand and water approach to extinguishing <b>coal</b> <b>fires,</b> though requiring attention and labor {{for long periods of time}} (up to a few years depending on how long the <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> has been burning prior to extinguishing activities), is very cost effective. Exact economics of a particular <b>coal</b> <b>fire</b> would have to be determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the size and age of the fire, but those costs include only sand, water, labor, and heavy equipment to transport the sand around. The proposed extinguishing technique involves capping all exhaust vents of a fire with sand, and then saturating the sand with water. The steam created by the water on contact with the heated ground and coal then expands and flows through the cavity, flowing out of what were originally combustion air influent vents. This flow reversal could significantly reduce the oxygen intake while also removing heat. Over time, as more vents are discovered or created, they can be capped in the same manner. On the economics side, CFG proved that even at conservative estimates of the cost to extinguish fires and the cost of alternative CO 2 sequestering methods, extinguishing <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> is the for immediate global emission reduction. CFG proposes that <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> around the world are prioritized ahead of new and expensive technology for emission reduction, and that at the very least the emissions from <b>coal</b> <b>fires</b> are drawn into some regulating system so that they can be tracked and better managed...|$|R
