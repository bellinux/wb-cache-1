40|$|The paper {{proposed}} an automatic and accurate extraction {{of the human}} <b>face</b> <b>contour</b> algorithm. Because a human <b>face</b> <b>contour</b> includes very important facial features to identifying or verifying a person, the accuracy of <b>face</b> <b>contour</b> extraction influences performance of face recognition. The automatic extraction human <b>face</b> <b>contour</b> algorithm includes a novel flowchart for improving accuracy of <b>face</b> <b>contours</b> extraction. To obtain the edge map of a <b>face</b> <b>contour,</b> the divided-and-conquer technique and Canny edge detector were used to avoid the features in {{the central part of}} face. The genetic algorithm is implemented to automatically find the parameters of Canny edge detector. Finally, the Poisson gradient vector flow (PGVF) active contour model used the edge map to extract <b>face</b> <b>contours.</b> Three datasets with temporal sequence images were tested for evaluation of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrated that the algorithm obtained accurate <b>face</b> <b>contours.</b> (C) 2010 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|<b>Face</b> <b>contour</b> {{represents}} {{important information}} used for human face analysis in image and video. Here, we propose an improvement {{to the conventional}} active contour model, called Snake, to track complex <b>face</b> <b>contour.</b> We propose using Gradient Angular Difference (GAD) to constrain the Snake contour to the specific face region. The Snake method obtains the optimal contour by iteratively minimizing its energy function. The iteration process is time consuming. Therefore, we proposed a motion compensation method to accelerate the <b>face</b> <b>contour</b> tracking process using Snake method in image sequences. The technique is shown to greatly reduce the computation time needed to minimize Snake energy.

40|$|AbstractProlonged {{exposure}} to a visual stimulus, such as a happy face, biases the perception of subsequently presented neutral face toward sad perception, the known face adaptation. Face adaptation is affected by visibility or awareness of the adapting face. However, whether it is affected by discriminability of the adapting face is largely unknown. In the current study, we used crowding to manipulate discriminability of the adapting face and test its effect on face adaptation. Instead of presenting flanking faces near the target face, we shortened the distance between facial features (internal feature crowding), and reduced the size of <b>face</b> <b>contour</b> (external contour crowding), to introduce crowding. We are interested in whether internal feature crowding or external contour crowding is more effective in inducing crowding effect in our first experiment. We found that combining internal feature and external contour crowding, but not either of them alone, induced significant crowding effect. In Experiment 2, we went on further to investigate its effect on adaptation. We found that both internal feature crowding and external contour crowding reduced its facial expression aftereffect (FEA) significantly. However, {{we did not find}} a significant correlation between discriminability of the adapting face and its FEA. Interestingly, we found a significant correlation between discriminabilities of the adapting and test faces. Experiment 3 found that the reduced adaptation aftereffect in combined crowding by the external <b>face</b> <b>contour</b> and the internal facial features cannot be decomposed into the effects from the <b>face</b> <b>contour</b> and facial features linearly. It thus suggested a nonlinear integration between facial features and <b>face</b> <b>contour</b> in <b>face</b> adaptation...|$|R
30|$|Since {{the costly}} part of appearance-based methods is the brute-force {{search for the}} landmarks, an {{efficient}} method to restrict the search area {{is the use of}} vertical and horizontal gray-value projections. Projections are simple to implement, while being at the same time quite effective in determining a first coarse estimate of feature positions. Brunelli and Poggio [65] have performed edge projection analysis by partitioning the edge map in terms of horizontal and vertical edge directions. Other researchers found out that more exact results can be obtained by applying the projection analysis on the intensity image, since most faces have fairly smooth <b>contours</b> <b>faces</b> [39, 40, 44, 66, 67]. These approaches use histogram dips caused by the gray level variations of the face components, which for the eyes and mouth regions tend to be darker than the skin level.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} articulated 3 D upper body tracking in monocular scenes using a graphical model to represent an articulated body structure. Belief propagation on factor graphs is used to compute the marginal probabilities of limbs. The body model is a loose-limbed model including attraction factors between adjacent limbs and constraints to reject poses resulting in collisions. To solve ambiguities resulting from monocular view, robust contour and colour based cues are extracted from the images. Moreover, a set of constraints on the model articulations is implemented according to human pose capabilities. Quantitative and qualitative results illustrate {{the efficiency of the}} proposed algorithm. Figure 1 : Upper body tracking.

40|$|GVF Snake {{algorithm}} can't extract {{an accurate}} image edge if the face {{has a large}} scale change. And {{it is difficult for}} GVF Snake algorithm to solve deep depression problem and the occlusion problem which is more complex. A method of extracting the <b>contour</b> of <b>face</b> is proposed in this study, which combines Mean Shift, grey prediction and improved GVF Snake algorithm. Firstly it employs the Mean Shift algorithm and the grey prediction tracking technologies to get the initial area of the face and then the improved GVF Snake algorithm is used to get the accurate <b>face</b> <b>contour.</b> It effectively solves the problems of initialization and being unable to iterate into deep depression in the GVF Snake algorithm. When the face is partially occluded, the Mean Shift and GM (1, 1) will be used to solve it. When the face is totally occluded, the grey forecasting model will be used. The experimental results show that the algorithm can achieve the <b>face</b> <b>contour</b> accurately and has strong robustness to the irregular movement and serious occlusion of the face in both static and dynamic scenes...|$|R

40|$|The {{extraction}} of figure symmetry from image <b>contours</b> <b>faces</b> {{a number of}} fundamental difficulties: object symmetries are distorted due to (i) gaps in the bounding contour of a shape due to figure-ground blending, weak contrast edges, highlights, noise, etc.; (ii) an introduction of parts and occluders, and (iii) spurious edge elements due to surface markings, texture, etc. A framework for extracting such symmetries from real images is proposed based on the propagation of contour orientation information and the detection of four types of singularities (shocks) arising from the collision of propagating elements. In this paper, we show that an additional labeling of shocks based on whether the colliding wavefronts carry true orientation information (regular vs. rarefaction waves) allows a division of shocks into three sets: regular shocks are the partial shocks of partial contours as they remain invariant to {{the completion of the}} contour; semi-degenerate and degenerate shocks depict p [...] ...|$|R

Firstly, the main facial elements are detected with AAM method entirely from the input screen images. Such elements {{are mainly composed of}} shape-based and appearance methods. These are used for learning the facial model and for matching the face from new screen images based on the learned models. Secondly, the face and background are separated in the screen image. Four points with the biggest possibilities for wrinkling are selected from the face and high wrinkle weighted values are assigned to them. Finally, the wrinkles are detected by applying Canny edge algorithm for the interested points of weighted value. The suggested algorithm adopts various screen images for experiment. The experiments display the excellent results of face and wrinkle detection in the most of the screen images...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Thickness-shear mode {{quartz crystal}} {{microbalance}} (QCM) {{has been widely}} used as liquid-phase sensors, such as viscometers and bio-detectors. However, due to coupling between the in-plane shear motion and the out-of-plane flexure, when used in contact with or immersed in a liquid, the out-of-plane motion generates compressional waves in the liquid that reflect off the liquid surface {{and return to the}} crystal. This interference effect causes depth-sensitive perturbations in the sensor response, often undesirable. In this study, we show that torsional-mode resonators may be used for liquid sensing without the depth effect. Samples in form of stepped plates, circular decals, and convex <b>contoured</b> <b>faces</b> are machined in elastic plates (e. g., cast aluminum, stainless steel, and brass). A non-contact electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) was employed to drive torsional-mode vibrations. Efficient energy trapping was observed for first-order torsional modes, leading to high quality factors. When placed in contact with water, the resonance frequency of the torsional mode was found to be independent of the water depth, in contrast to depth-dependent frequency oscillation for the thickness-shear mode. Finite element analyses are conducted to understand the torsional-mode vibrations as well as the effect of material anisotropy. I...|$|R

40|$|Current face {{alignment}} algorithms can robustly find {{a set of}} landmarks along <b>face</b> <b>contour.</b> However, the landmarks are sparse {{and lack}} curve details, especially in chin and cheek areas {{where a lot of}} concave-convex bending information exists. In this paper, we propose a local to global seam cutting and integrating algorithm (L 2 GSCI) to extract continuous and accurate <b>face</b> <b>contour.</b> Our method works in three steps {{with the help of a}} rough initial curve. First, we sample small and overlapped squares along the initial curve. Second, the seam cutting part of L 2 GSCI extracts a local seam in each square region. Finally, the seam integrating part of L 2 GSCI connects all the redundant seams together to form a continuous and complete face curve. Overall, the proposed method is much more straightforward than existing face alignment algorithms, but can achieve pixel-level continuous face curves rather than discrete and sparse landmarks. Moreover, experiments on two face benchmark datasets (i. e., LFPW and HELEN) show that our method can precisely reveal concave-convex bending details of <b>face</b> <b>contours,</b> which has significantly improved the performance when compared with the state-ofthe- art face alignment approaches...|$|R
40|$|Despite ample research, the {{structure}} and the functional characteristics of neural systems involved in human face processing are still a matter of active debate. Here we dissociated between a neural mechanism manifested by the face-sensitive N 170 event-related potential effect and a mechanism manifested by induced electroencephalographic oscillations in the gamma band, which have been previously associated with the integration of individually coded features and activation of corresponding neural representations. The amplitude of the N 170 was larger {{in the absence of}} the <b>face</b> <b>contour</b> but not affected by the configuration of inner components (ICs). Its latency was delayed by scrambling the configuration of the components as well as by the absence of the <b>face</b> <b>contour.</b> Unlike the N 170, the amplitude of the induced gamma activity was sensitive to the configuration of ICs but insensitive to their presence within or outside a <b>face</b> <b>contour.</b> This pattern suggests a dual mechanism for early face processing, each utilizing different visual cues, which might indicate their respective roles in face processing. The N 170 seems to be associated primarily with the detection and categorization of faces, whereas the gamma oscillations may be involved in the activation of their mental representation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn 2010 Thompson {{reported}} a "fat face thin" illusion that, when {{next to an}} inverted face, an upright face looks "fatter". Sun et al (2012 Perception 41 117 - 120) observed {{that one of the}} faces need not be inverted for the illusion to emerge: when two identical faces are presented one above the other, the face at the bottom appears "fatter" than the top one. Neither inverted faces nor clocks induced the illusion. Here we conducted three experiments probing the role that <b>face</b> <b>contour</b> plays in producing the fat face illusion. In experiment 1 line drawing faces were found to induce the illusion, suggesting that <b>face</b> <b>contour</b> is important for producing the illusion. In experiment 2 line drawing faces with scrambled internal features and empty line drawing faces devoid of internal features were found to induce the illusion. In experiment 3 internal face features arranged in their canonical face layout, but not in a scrambled layout, were found to induce the illusion. However, the magnitude of the effect was significantly weaker than the effect obtained for empty <b>face</b> <b>contour</b> in experiment 2. Collectively, these results suggest that a fat face illusion is obtained when there is sufficient information in the stimulus to activate an internal face schema...|$|R
