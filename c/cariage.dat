The word car, then meaning a kind of two-wheeled cart for goods, also came from Old Northern French about {{the beginning of the}} 14th century; it was also used for railway carriages, and was extended to cover automobile around {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, when early models were called horseless carriages.|$|E

50|$|New {{carriage}} sheds were erected at South Gosforth {{and as part}} of {{the preparation}} for electrification, a spur was built from south to west at Benton, for empty stock to reach the sheds from the main line. It opened on 1 May 1903. A south to east curve was opened nearby on 1 July 1904 giving express electric trains access between the coast and Newcastle via the main line. A north spur from South Gosforth East to South Gosforth West was opened in 1905 (associated with the Ponteland branch), giving empty stock trains easier access to the <b>cariage</b> depot.|$|E

40|$|Rev. Henry Cooke {{wrote in}} the Gibraltar Record in July, 1903 about "a new {{excitement}} at Put-in-Bay - An Aerial Railway. " His description suggests the railway was what we'd call today a roller coaster: "Why is it people like such things, to turn and twist and dive, and be thrown {{from one side to}} the other of a baby <b>cariage</b> [sic] on wheels, all (with a spice of danger thrown in) for a nickel (six for a quarter). Yet even we old people went once in a while just to take the children [...] . who were wild over it. ...|$|E

40|$|Sir Francis Bacon was {{a corrupt}} {{political}} pedant, a shameless puppet for James I, and an incorrigible opportunist. He was a frustrated man bedraggled {{in matters of}} morals, a bold and blatant self-promoter, and his conscience was perpetually drenched in the swamp of his own financial destitution. Although he remained {{one of the most}} brilliant scientific minds in England during the seventeenth-century, during his life Bacon was verily detested by his contemporaries. To achieve his lofty ambitions as advisor,judge, and ultimately Lord Chancellor to the King, Bacon would betray friend and benefactor, publicly and privately, without remorse. He would never act with honor or charity unless it could elevate his position in court. So it stands that when the national hero Sir Walter Raleigh returned a broken and defeated man from a failed expedition in the New World, Bacon advocated the will of James I and the insidious Spanish Ambassador Count Gondomar rather than {{the will of the people}} and judged Raleigh vilified and humiliated, subsequently executing him without appeal. These actions of sycophantic statesmanship by Bacon in A Declaration of the Demeanor and <b>Cariage</b> Of Sir Walter Raleigh suggest that Raleigh was unjustly tried and condemned...|$|E
