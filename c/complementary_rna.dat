5|$|Gene {{expression}} in prokaryotes {{is influenced by}} an RNA-based system similar in some respects to RNAi. Here, RNA-encoding genes control mRNA abundance or translation by producing a <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA</b> that anneals to an mRNA. However these regulatory RNAs are not {{generally considered to be}} analogous to miRNAs because the dicer enzyme is not involved. It has been suggested that CRISPR interference systems in prokaryotes are analogous to eukaryotic RNA interference systems, although none of the protein components are orthologous.|$|E
5|$|DNA usually {{occurs as}} linear {{chromosomes}} in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. The set of chromosomes {{in a cell}} makes up its genome; the human genome has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes. The information carried by DNA is held in the sequence of pieces of DNA called genes. Transmission of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing. For example, in transcription, when a cell uses the information in a gene, the DNA sequence is copied into a <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA</b> sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides. Usually, this RNA copy is then {{used to make a}} matching protein sequence in a process called translation, which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides. In alternative fashion, a cell may simply copy its genetic information in a process called DNA replication. The details of these functions are covered in other articles; here {{the focus is on the}} interactions between DNA and other molecules that mediate the function of the genome.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{elongation}} is {{the synthesis of}} {{a copy of the}} DNA into messenger RNA. RNA Pol II matches <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA</b> nucleotides to the template DNA by Watson-Crick base pairing. These RNA nucleotides are ligated, resulting in a strand of messenger RNA.|$|E
25|$|Long dsRNA {{which can}} come from the {{following}} sources: hairpin, <b>complementary</b> <b>RNAs,</b> RNA dependent RNA polymerases. The long dsRNA is cleaved by an endo-ribonuclease called Dicer. Dicer cuts the long dsRNA to form short interfering RNA or siRNA; this is what enables the molecules to form the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC).|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for radioactively labeling viral RNA {{and then quickly}} halting further incorporation of radioactive precursor into RNA so that {{the fate of the}} labeled RNA can be followed. Small <b>complementary</b> <b>RNAs</b> synthesized during vesicular stomatitis virus infection in the presence of cycloheximide do not metabolize to virion length molecules when protein synthesis inhibition is reversed...|$|R
50|$|When mRNA forms a duplex with a <b>complementary</b> {{antisense}} <b>RNA</b> sequence, {{translation is}} blocked. This process {{is related to}} RNA interference.|$|R
25|$|Transcription is {{the process}} where genetic {{information}} in DNA is used to produce a <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA</b> strand. This RNA strand is then processed to give messenger RNA (mRNA), which is free to migrate through the cell. mRNA molecules bind to protein-RNA complexes called ribosomes located in the cytosol, where they are translated into polypeptide sequences. The ribosome mediates {{the formation of a}} polypeptide sequence based on the mRNA sequence. The mRNA sequence directly relates to the polypeptide sequence by binding to transfer RNA (tRNA) adapter molecules in binding pockets within the ribosome. The new polypeptide then folds into a functional three-dimensional protein molecule.|$|E
25|$|Only {{one of the}} two DNA strands {{serve as}} a {{template}} for transcription. The antisense strand of DNA is read by RNA polymerase from the 3' end to the 5' end during transcription (3' → 5'). The <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA</b> is created in the opposite direction, in the 5' → 3' direction, matching the sequence of the sense strand with the exception of switching uracil for thymine. This directionality is because RNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3' end of the growing mRNA chain. This use of only the 3' → 5' DNA strand eliminates the need for the Okazaki fragments that are seen in DNA replication. This also removes the need for an RNA primer to initiate RNA synthesis, {{as is the case in}} DNA replication.|$|E

40|$|Altritol {{nucleic acids}} (ANAs) are RNA analogues with a {{phosphorylated}} D-altritol backbone. The nucleobase is attached at the 2 -(S) -position of the carbohydrate moiety. We report that ANA oligomers {{are superior to}} the corresponding DNA, RNA, and HNA (hexitol nucleic acid) in supporting efficient nonenzymatic template-directed synthesis of <b>complementary</b> <b>RNAs</b> from nucleoside- 5 '-phosphoro- 2 -methyl imidazolides.

40|$|Small RNAs play an {{important}} role in regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic and eubacterial cells by modulating gene expression both at the level of transcription and translation. Here, we show that short <b>complementary</b> <b>RNAs</b> can also affect gene expression by stimulating ribosomal frameshifting in vitro. This finding has important implications for understanding the process of ribosomal frameshifting and for the potential application of small RNAs in the treatment of diseases that are due to frameshift mutations...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{two major}} classes of {{regulatory}} strategies that control plasmid copy number involves recognition via base pairing between two plasmid-encoded <b>complementary</b> <b>RNAs.</b> The detailed analysis of this control circuitry has revealed some features of regulatory mechanisms based on RNA-RNA interaction that distinguish them from those based on protein-nucleic acid interaction. These features provide a framework with which to understand other regulatory mechanisms based on RNA-RNA interaction, and will aid in the design of efficient artificial antisense RNA systems...|$|R
500|$|Synthesis of RNA {{is usually}} catalyzed by an enzyme—RNA polymerase—using DNA as a template, {{a process known}} as {{transcription}}. Initiation of transcription begins with the binding of the enzyme to a promoter sequence in the DNA (usually found [...] "upstream" [...] of a gene). The DNA double helix is unwound by the helicase activity of the enzyme. The enzyme then progresses along the template strand in the 3’ to 5’ direction, synthesizing a <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA</b> molecule with elongation occurring in the 5’ to 3’ direction. The DNA sequence also dictates where termination of RNA synthesis will occur.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lagging strand}} is {{synthesized}} in short, separated segments. On the lagging strand template, a primase [...] "reads" [...] the template DNA and initiates synthesis {{of a short}} <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA</b> primer. A DNA polymerase extends the primed segments, forming Okazaki fragments. The RNA primers are then removed and replaced with DNA, and the fragments of DNA are joined together by DNA ligase.|$|E

40|$|Ribozymes {{have the}} {{potential}} to ablate the expression of any gene in a sequence-specific manner and, therefore, may be useful as therapeutic molecules or as tools for the analysis of gene function. Although a number of reports have described ribozymes that are effective in inhibiting gene expression, few studies have attempted, systematically, to analyze the features of ribozymes that affect their potency within cells. Experimental observations suggest that emerging rules governing ribozyme potency in cells can be understood in terms of the competitive interactions between RNA-binding proteins, <b>complementary</b> <b>RNAs</b> and their internal secondary structure...|$|R
25|$|The 10-23 DNAzyme {{contains}} a 15-nucleotide catalytic core that {{is flanked by}} two substrate recognition domains. This DNAzyme cleaves <b>complementary</b> <b>RNAs</b> efficiently in a sequence specific manner between an unpaired purine and a paired pyrimidine. DNAzymes targeting AU or GU vs. GC or AC are more effective. Furthermore, the RNA cleavage rates {{have been shown to}} increase after the introduction of intercalators or the substitution of deoxyguanine with deoxyinosine at the junction of the catalytic loop. Specifically, the addition of 2’-O-methyl modifications to the catalytic proved to significantly increase the cleavage rate both in vitro and in vivo.|$|R
2500|$|Both DNA and RNA are nucleic acids, {{which use}} base pairs of {{nucleotides}} as a complementary language. [...] During transcription, a DNA sequence is read by an RNA polymerase, which produces a <b>complementary,</b> antiparallel <b>RNA</b> strand called a primary transcript.|$|R
50|$|Antisense RNA (asRNA) is a {{single-stranded}} RNA that is complementary to {{a messenger}} RNA (mRNA) strand transcribed within a cell. Some authors {{have used the}} term micRNA (mRNA-interfering <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA)</b> to refer to these RNAs {{but it is not}} widely used.|$|E

5000|$|Silencing of RNA {{occurs when}} double {{stranded}} RNA molecules are processed {{by a series}} of enzymatic reactions, resulting in RNA fragments that degrade <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA</b> sequences. [...] By degrading transcripts, a lower amount of protein products are translated and the phenotype is altered by yet another RNA processing event.|$|E
40|$|A {{region of}} {{potential}} complex secondary structure within the {{human immunodeficiency virus}} env mRNA has been implicated in Rev-mediated export of viral structural mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. By using an RNase protection gel-mobility-shift assay, we demonstrate that purified Rev protein forms a stable complex with this Rev-responsive RNA. RNAs with mutations designed to disrupt formation of a predicted stem structure no longer interact with Rev. However, Rev binding is restored upon annealing of the two <b>complementary</b> <b>RNAs</b> {{that make up the}} stem. These results suggest that direct interaction of Rev with the Rev-responsive element could facilitate transport of human immunodeficiency virus structural mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{supposed}} {{that for a}} nucleic acid analog to pair with RNA it must, like RNA, have a backbone {{with at least a}} sixatom repeat; a shorter backbone presumably would not stretch far enough to bind RNA properly. The Eschenmoser group has shown, however, that this first impression is incorrect. As they report in their new paper, Eschenmoser and co-workers (I) have now synthesized a substantial number of these polymers, which are called (L) -a-threofuranosyl oligonucleotides or TNAs. They are composed of bases linked to a threose sugar-phosphate backbone, with phosphodiester bonds connecting the nucleotides. The investigators discovered that pairs of complementary TNAs do indeed form stable Watson-Crick double helices and, perhaps more importantly, that TNAs form stable double helices with <b>complementary</b> <b>RNAs</b> and DNAs...|$|R
50|$|The {{next step}} after entry is the {{transcription}} of the viral genome by the P-L polymerase (P {{is an essential}} cofactor for the L polymerase) {{in order to make}} new viral protein. The viral polymerase can only recognize ribonucleoprotein and cannot use free RNA as template. Transcription is regulated by cis-acting sequences on the virus genome and by protein M which is not only essential for virus budding but also regulates the fraction of mRNA production to replication. Later in infection, the activity of the polymerase switches to replication in order to produce full-length positive-strand <b>RNA</b> copies. These <b>complementary</b> <b>RNAs</b> are used as templates to make new negative-strand RNA genomes. They are packaged together with protein N to form ribonucleoprotein which then can form new viruses.|$|R
50|$|MicL RNA (mRNA-interfering <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA</b> {{regulator}} of Lpp) is a σ E transcription factor-dependent small non-coding RNA. It {{was discovered}} in E. coli. Together with MicA and RybB sRNAs, MicL sRNA down-regulates the synthesis of abundant outer membrane proteins in response to stress. MicL specifically targets mRNA of lipoprotein Lpp, preventing its translation.|$|E
50|$|T7 RNA {{polymerase}} binds to the promoter {{region on}} the double strand. Since T7 RNA polymerase can only transcribe in the 3' to 5' direction the sense DNA is transcribed and an anti-sense RNA is produced. This is repeated, and the polymerase continuously produces <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA</b> strands of this template {{which results in}} amplification.|$|E
50|$|The {{level of}} RNA {{synthesis}} {{has been shown}} to be affected by the cis-acting properties of certain elements on the RNA (such as RNA1 and 2), which include core promoter sequences which regulate the site of initiation for the <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA</b> strand synthesis. This mechanism is thought to be recognised by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, found encoded within the genome.|$|E
50|$|An {{increased}} conformational inflexibility of {{the sugar}} moiety in nucleosides (oligonucleotides) results in a gain of high binding affinity with <b>complementary</b> single-stranded <b>RNA</b> and/or double-stranded DNA. The first 2’,4’-BNA (LNA) monomers were first synthesized by Takeshi Imanishi’s group in 1997 followed independently by Jesper Wengel’s group in 1998.|$|R
30|$|As {{postulated}} in cellular genomics (Bartel 2004; Moqil 2012), {{there is}} a possibility that studies on the roles of naturally occurring non-coding micro ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) might profoundly inhibit the expression of pain genes and epigenetic mechanisms. Since miRNAs are endogenously produced, its molecular mechanism fuels the binding of small-interfering RNA strands to Argonaute proteins to form effectors complexes known as RNA induced silencing complex. In animals, miRNAs function in a way to direct mRNA cleavage or repress translation of <b>complementary</b> <b>RNAs</b> during brain development, organogenesis, pathways signalling, apoptosis, metabolism, cardiogenesis and many other biological processes (McDaneld 2009; Wang et al. 2010). It becomes expedient in future studies therefore, to link the roles of endogenous neuron-inhibitors with changes in noiceptors miRNA producing enzymes while pregnant meat species undergo stunning and slaughter processes at the abattoir or in traditional settings.|$|R
40|$|DNA {{oligomers}} were synthesized {{that are}} perfectly complementary to different {{segments of the}} tryptophan (trp) operon leader transcript. These 15 nucleotide long oligomers were used as probes of the involvement of transcript secondary structures in two processes: transcription pausing at the pause site located near base pair 90 in the leader region, and transcription termination at the attenuator. The 15 -mers were complementary to the four segments of the trp leader transcript which {{have been shown to}} form the alternative secondary structures that are believed to be responsible for pausing, termination, and antitermination. Oligomers <b>complementary</b> to <b>RNA</b> segments 1 and 3 relieved termination while the 15 -mer <b>complementary</b> to <b>RNA</b> segment 1 relieved pausing. 15 -mers complementary to segment 2 had no effect on pausing and the oligomer complementary to segment 4 had virtually no effect on termination...|$|R
5000|$|The hok/sok {{system is}} a postsegregational killing {{mechanism}} employed by the R1 plasmid in Escherichia coli. It was the first type I toxin-antitoxin pair to be identified through characterisation of a plasmid-stabilising locus. It is a type I system because the toxin is neutralised by a <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA,</b> rather than a partnered protein (type II toxin-antitoxin).|$|E

50|$|QRICH2 mRNA is 5411 bp long, and its {{chromosomal}} {{location in}} human is 17q25.1. QRICH2 mRNA has 19 exons and it contains two main function domains: a {{high molecular weight}} Glutenin domain (amino acid 446-979) and an ATPase involved domain (amino acid 1036-1413). QRICH2 locates between UBAL D2 gene and PRPSAP1 gene on chromosome 17. There is no predicted stem loop structure on QRICH2 mRNA because there isn't any <b>complementary</b> <b>RNA</b> sequences.|$|E
40|$|We have {{obtained}} a novel family of LTR-retrotransposons in Xenopus laevis, named Xretpos, from cDNA and genomic clones. Its long terminal repeats (LTRs) can be subdivided into U 3, R, and U 3 to U 5 region, and are bounded by 6 bp inverted repeats. Xretpos contains primer binding site and polypurine tract, and multiple copies of Xretpos-related element {{are present in}} the genome. A long open reading frame (ORF) encodes the CCHC motif conserved in retroviral gag proteins and leucine zipper motif capable of forming the coiled-coil. However, no amino acid homology to usually conserved retroviral pol gene was revealed. We report that in vitro synthesized Xretpos <b>complementary</b> <b>RNAs</b> are translated to produce a predicted size of protein.

40|$|Whereas {{the strong}} and stable {{suppression}} of specific microRNA activity would be {{essential for the}} functional analysis of these molecules, and also {{for the development of}} therapeutic applications, effective inhibitory methods to achieve this have not yet been fully established. In our current study, we tested various RNA decoys which were designed to efficiently expose indigestible <b>complementary</b> <b>RNAs</b> to a specific miRNA molecule. These inhibitory RNAs were at the same time designed to be expressed in lentiviral vectors and to be transported into the cytoplasm after transcription by RNA polymerase III. We report the optimal conditions that we have established for the design of such RNA decoys (we term these molecules TuD RNAs; tough decoy RNAs). We finally demonstrate that TuD RNAs induce specific and strong biological effects and also show that TuD RNAs achieve the efficient and long-term-suppression of specific miRNAs for over 1 month in mammalian cells...|$|R
