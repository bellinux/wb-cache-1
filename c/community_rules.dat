500|$|Mulder and Scully discuss {{possible}} {{motives for}} the Klines' presumed murders, and Scully decides {{to have the}} substances analyzed in San Diego. Mulder decides to test his theories that noncompliance with the <b>community</b> <b>rules</b> is the motive by sticking a plastic flamingo in the yard, damaging the mailbox, among other antics. Mulder later finds a note in his mailbox that says, [...] "Be like the others... before it gets dark". After dark, Mulder brings out his basketball hoop, and Shroeder runs over to frantically argue with Mulder to put it away.

Mulder believes the Klines were buried in their yard, so the next day he gets a backhoe to dig up the front yard, telling the neighbors he's putting in a reflecting pool, which is not against the <b>community</b> <b>rules.</b> They don't find the Klines, but they do find the tacky windmill that had been mysteriously delivered to the Klines before they died. The windmill bears a label from Gogolak's company.|$|E
25|$|Within this {{approach}} {{of the majority of}} scholars, the textual relationship between the Damascus Document and <b>Community</b> <b>Rule</b> is not completely resolved, though there is a general agreement that they have some evolutionary connection. Some suspect that the <b>Community</b> <b>Rule</b> is the original text that was later altered to become the Damascus Document, others that the Damascus Document was redacted to become the <b>Community</b> <b>Rule,</b> a third group argues that the <b>Community</b> <b>Rule</b> was created as a utopian ideal rather than a practical replacement for the Damascus Document, and still others that believe the <b>Community</b> <b>Rule</b> and Damascus Document were written for different types of communities, one enclosed and the other open.|$|R
5000|$|The Rule of the Congregation (1QSa) is an {{appendix}} {{to one of}} {{the first}} seven Dead Sea Scrolls discovered in caves near the Qumran site in 1946. Three related sectarian documents were discovered in Qumran Cave 1: The <b>Community</b> <b>Rule</b> (1QS), The Rule of the Congregation (1QSa), and The Rule of the Blessing (1QSb). The Rule of the Congregation and the Rule of the Blessing were at first overlooked by researchers and considered a continuation of the much longer <b>Community</b> <b>Rule.</b> After careful study, it was revealed that the two texts acted as appendices to the first <b>Community</b> <b>Rule</b> scroll, and described an eschatological community (identified as the Yahad in the <b>Community</b> <b>Rule)</b> existing in Israel during the “end of times.” ...|$|R

500|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{investigate}} the Klines' disappearance, going undercover as new homeowners under the aliases Rob and Laura Petrie. As Mulder and Scully {{are moving into}} the Klines' former home, neighbor Win Shroeder nervously tucks away Mulder's basketball hoop into the garage, telling him that it is against the community's CC. Settling in, the agents begin searching the house and find {{what appears to be}} blood on a blade of the ceiling fan. When Big Mike, another neighbor, wants to let the [...] "Petries" [...] in on the [...] "consequences" [...] of breaking the <b>community</b> <b>rules,</b> homeowner association president Gene Gogolak describes him as [...] "a weak link" [...] to be dealt with. That night, Big Mike disappears after being attacked by the creature. While taking a walk, Scully later finds the Schroeder's dog Scruffy and Big Mike's necklace in a storm drain. Scruffy's face is covered in a substance that looks like blood.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were two}} {{distinct}} periods of recruitment. During the first period, which lasted until 1966, {{a large number}} of Turks came to the Netherlands through unofficial channels, either being recruited by employers or immigrating spontaneously. A small economic recession began in 1966. Some of the labour migrants were forced to return to Turkey. In 1968, the economy picked up again and a new recruitment period, which was to last until 1974, commenced. In May 1968, new European Economic <b>Community</b> <b>rules</b> forced the Netherlands to instate a travel visa system to regulate labour immigration and from then on, the state recruited foreign workers. The peak of Turkish labour migration occurred during these years. The Turks eventually surpassed other migrant nationalities in numbers and came to represent the Dutch image of guest workers. Due to the 1973 oil crisis, the Den Uyl cabinet ended labour immigration in 1974. Because from then on re-entry into the Netherlands was impossible, Turkish remigration strongly decreased. A system of family reunification had been arranged in the 1960s and gradually Turkish workers after 1974 brought over their wife and children. The latter predominantly married partners from Turkey. In the early twenty-first century the Second Balkenende cabinet imposed much stricter conditions on unification, to a large extent ending Turkish [...] "marriage immigration". This coincided with a drop in birth rates, leading to a gradual levelling off in the growth of people of Turkish descent. Since 2003, there have often been years with an emigration surplus.|$|E
