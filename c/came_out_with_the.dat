5|$|The morning draw {{consisted}} of mixed doubles play, where Team North America dominated Team World and earned the first sweep of three {{points in the}} event. Heath McCormick and Jessica Mair dominated Sebastian Kraupp and Maria Prytz, stealing three ends {{en route to a}} six-point victory. Glenn Howard and Natalie Nicholson held an early lead over Greg Drummond and Anna Sloan after a four-point second end, but Drummond and Sloan came back to make it a close game. In the end, Howard and Nicholson scored two to win the game. Brent Laing and Jennifer Jones played a back-and-forth game with Torger Nergård and Carmen Küng, but retained control through most of the game and <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> victory after Küng's last shot left Team North America having shot stone, effectively giving Laing and Jones the win.|$|E

25|$|In February, {{the people}} rose again: Alexius IV was imprisoned and executed, and Murzuphlus took the purple as Alexius V. He made some attempt {{to repair the}} walls and organise the citizenry, {{but there had been}} no {{opportunity}} to bring in troops from the provinces and the guards were demoralised by the revolution. An attack by the Crusaders on 6 April failed, but a second from the Golden Horn on 12 April succeeded, and the invaders poured in. Alexius V fled. The Senate met in Hagia Sophia and offered the crown to Theodore Lascaris, who had married into the Angelid family, but it was too late. He <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Patriarch to the Golden Milestone before the Great Palace and addressed the Varangian Guard. Then the two of them slipped away with many of the nobility and embarked for Asia. By the next day the Doge and the leading Franks were installed in the Great Palace, and the city was given over to pillage for three days.|$|E
500|$|DeSoto died a slow {{death in}} the 1950s owing to {{decreasing}} popularity and the 1958 recession. [...] Chrysler moved the DeSoto into the mainstream price range when it <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> upper priced Imperial line, putting the Chrysler marque in direct competition with it. [...] By the 1961 model year, the DeSoto {{was reduced to a}} single model and on November 18, 1960, Chrysler ended the DeSoto marque, just two weeks after the introduction of the 1961 models. [...] Chrysler's seemingly sudden announcement to discontinue the marque resulted in negative publicity as their advertising and press releases had given the impression the brand would be continued. [...] It offered a $300 discount towards 1962 Chrysler vehicles to recent DeSoto purchasers as consolation. [...] Added to the expense of changing signs at dealerships and other expenses, the estimated the cost of ending the marque was more than $2.2 million.|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{explained}} that the Beatles had only experienced sex with girls from Liverpool, but {{when they got to}} Hamburg the only women who hung around the clubs late at night were strippers, dancers, or prostitutes. Harrison (who was then only 17) called Hamburg [...] "the naughtiest city in the world". McCartney said: [...] "By the time you got to Hamburg, a girlfriend there was likely to be a stripper, so to be suddenly involved with a hard-core striptease artist, who obviously knew {{a thing or two about}} sex... it was quite an eye-opener." [...] Gerry Marsden—frontman for Gerry & the Pacemakers—remembered visiting a Hamburg brothel in Herbertstrasse with Lennon: [...] "We paid our money, went in and sat down. This guy <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> biggest lady we had ever seen in our lives. She looked like a bus with a bra on. We ran out that door so quick we didn't hear it shut.

The day after a Newcastle gig, Strummer and Headon were arrested for stealing pillowcases from their hotel room. That same month, CBS released [...] "Remote Control" [...] as the debut LP's second single, defying the wishes of the band, who saw it as one of the album's weakest tracks. Headon's first recording with the band was the single [...] "Complete Control", which addressed the band's anger at their record label's behaviour. It was co-produced by famed reggae artist Lee [...] "Scratch" [...] Perry, though Foote was summoned to [...] "ground things" [...] a bit and the result was pure punk rock. Released in September 1977—NME noted how CBS allowed the group to [...] "bait their masters"—it rose to number 28 on the British chart and has gone on to be cited as one of punk's greatest singles. In February 1978, the band <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> single [...] "Clash City Rockers".

2500|$|In a 2008 video {{promoting}} Nike's Hyperdunk shoes, Bryant {{appears to}} jump over a speeding Aston Martin.

After promoting Nike's Hyperdunk shoes, Bryant <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fourth edition of his signature line by Nike, the Zoom Kobe IV. In 2010 Nike launched another shoe, Nike Zoom Kobe V. In 2009, Bryant signed a deal with Nubeo to market the [...] "Black Mamba collection", a line of sports/luxury watches that range from $25,000 to $285,000. On February 9, 2009, Bryant was featured on the cover of ESPN The Magazine. However, it was not for anything basketball related, rather it was about Bryant being a big fan of FC Barcelona. CNN estimated Bryant's endorsement deals in 2007 to be worth $16million a year. In 2010, Bryant was ranked third behind Tiger Woods and Jordan in Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes with $48million.|$|E
2500|$|Stinkfoot, a Comic Opera is an English musical with book, music, {{and lyrics}} by Vivian Stanshall and Ki Longfellow-Stanshall {{written for the}} Crackpot Theatre Company aboard the Old Profanity Showboat in Bristol, England. [...] The show {{is based on a}} series of tales written by Longfellow about Stinkfoot, a New York City alley cat, a bit of a rogue and more than a bit of a rake. [...] It had been {{intended}} for children, but when told by a New York City literary agent that “No mother in America would want her child identifying with Stinkfoot the alley cat, never mind its name,” [...] the story went into a drawer for many years. [...] It <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> meeting in 1977 of Vivian and Ki, at which point the story became bedtime reading for Vivian's son Rupert Stanshall (born 1968), and later for his daughter with Ki, Silky Longfellow-Stanshall (born 1979). [...] In 1985 it “grew up” when Vivian and Ki decided to base a musical on its lead character, Stinkfoot. [...] At that point, it became a melding of two very different visions and two very different musical traditions: Vivian’s days as frontman for the Bonzo Dog Band and his childhood in Leigh-on-Sea with Ki’s love of America’s Broadway.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1999, {{less than}} a month before her wedding, The Sun {{published}} a photo of a topless Sophie with her Capital Radio colleague Chris Tarrant, which was taken during a business trip to Spain in 1988. Buckingham Palace immediately issued a statement saying, [...] "This morning's story in The Sun is a gross invasion of privacy and cannot be regarded as in the public interest. It has caused considerable distress." [...] Prime Minister Tony Blair also condemned the publication of the photograph. The Palace made an official complaint to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC). According to Sophie's business partner the incident had left her [...] "distressed", and she was reportedly [...] "devastated" [...] and felt [...] "she was 'letting the side down’ before her wedding". Tarrant later said, [...] "There was never, ever the slightest hint of romance between Sophie and myself, let alone these snidey insinuations." [...] Following its publication, the newspaper issued a statement and apologised to Rhys-Jones and the next issue <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> headline [...] "Sorry, Sophie". It also said that it would again apologise to Sophie in a letter and donate all sale proceeds of the issue to her charities. The photo had been given to the tabloid by Kara Noble, a friend and colleague of Sophie, for £100,000. Noble later apologised in the following months saying, [...] "I just want to say sorry to everyone who was involved." [...] Both she and the newspaper faced criticism from the public, and Noble was fired from her job at Heart 106.2 FM. The couple later decided not to make a formal complaint.|$|E
2500|$|Stay Alive shows a {{different}} side of Nina, consisting mostly of original songs, and covers {{a wide range}} of genres from piano-driven ballads, midtempo pop blues, and house/synthpop to contemporary R The album showcases her passion for dance music, relying on more upbeat, catchy tunes.

From the time I <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Heaven album [...] I gained a lot of the confidence that I have now when I started gaining awards but not too much that it went to my head.
