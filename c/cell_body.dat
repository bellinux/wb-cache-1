5|$|Before {{the local}} protein {{synthesis}} hypothesis gained significant support, there was general {{agreement that the}} protein synthesis underlying L-LTP occurred in the <b>cell</b> <b>body.</b> Further, there was thought that the products of this synthesis were shipped cell-wide in a nonspecific manner. It thus became necessary to explain how protein synthesis could occur in the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> without compromising LTP's input specificity. The synaptic tagging hypothesis attempts to solve the cell's difficult problem of synthesizing proteins in the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> but ensuring they only reach synapses that have received LTP-inducing stimuli.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in studies}} {{restricted}} to postsynaptic events, investigators have not determined {{the location of}} the protein synthesis that underlies L-LTP. Specifically, it is unclear whether protein synthesis takes place in the postsynaptic <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> or in its dendrites. Despite having observed ribosomes (the major components of the protein synthesis machinery) in dendrites as early as the 1960s, prevailing wisdom was that the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> was the predominant site of protein synthesis in neurons. This reasoning was not seriously challenged until the 1980s, when investigators reported observing protein synthesis in dendrites whose connection to their <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> had been severed. More recently, investigators have demonstrated that this type of local protein synthesis is necessary for some types of LTP.|$|E

40|$|Lingual {{components}} of the autonomic nervous system {{are considered to be}} the most rostral portion of the enteric nervous system. Therefore our aim was to study the intrinsic nerve <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> and synapses using immunohisto-, immunocytochemical methods. Several small groups of ganglia with <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> immunoreactive (IR) for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and substance P (SP) were observed just below the gustatory epithelium. A few somatostatin and galanin IR nerve <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> were also found. Many IR <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> were also demonstrated in the glands and next to blood vessels. Some of these <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> were multipolar and some of them were small neurons with an ovoid shape having only one process. <b>Cell</b> <b>bodies</b> positive for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) were detected neither in the superficial nor in the deep portion. Electronmicroscopical analysis demonstrated different IR nerve fibres having axo-somatic and axo-dendritic synapses with other immunonegative cells. In a few cases VIP IR nerve processes were found to synaptize with other VIP positive nerve <b>cell</b> <b>bodies.</b> These results support the existance of intralingual reflex in the tongue, where the ganglia might have an integrative role of the different neuropeptide containing nerve fibres...|$|R

Binding sites labelled by [3 H]-spiperone in striatum were found to lie on striatal <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> and on the terminals of cortico-striate glutamate fibres, but not on presynaptic dopamine terminals. In contrast, binding sites labelled by [3 H]-NPA were demonstrated on striatal <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> and on the terminals of nigro-striata dopamine fibres, but not on cortical afferents. In substantia nigra, specific [3 H]-spiperone binding sites were found only on non-dopamine <b>cell</b> <b>bodies.</b> No clear evidence was found for their existence on dopamine <b>cell</b> <b>bodies,</b> the terminals of strio-nigral fibres or the terminals of cortico-nigral fibres.

5|$|The {{property}} that makes neurons unique is {{their ability to}} send signals to specific target cells over long distances. They send these signals {{by means of an}} axon, which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> and projects, usually with numerous branches, to other areas, sometimes nearby, sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body. The length of an axon can be extraordinary: for example, if a pyramidal cell, (an excitatory neuron) of the cerebral cortex were magnified so that its <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> became the size of a human body, its axon, equally magnified, would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter, extending more than a kilometer. These axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials, which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of 1–100 meters per second. Some neurons emit action potentials constantly, at rates of 10–100 per second, usually in irregular patterns; other neurons are quiet most of the time, but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials.|$|E
5|$|The {{synaptic}} tag hypothesis {{may also}} account for LTP's associativity and cooperativity. Associativity (see Properties) is observed when one synapse is excited with LTP-inducing stimulation while a separate synapse is only weakly stimulated. Whereas {{one might expect}} only the strongly stimulated synapse to undergo LTP (since weak stimulation alone is insufficient to induce LTP at either synapse), both synapses will in fact undergo LTP. While weak stimuli are unable to induce protein synthesis in the <b>cell</b> <b>body,</b> they may prompt the synthesis of a synaptic tag. Simultaneous strong stimulation of a separate pathway, capable of inducing <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> protein synthesis, then may prompt the production of plasticity-related proteins, which are shipped cell-wide. With both synapses expressing the synaptic tag, both would capture the protein products resulting in the expression of LTP in both the strongly stimulated and weakly stimulated pathways.|$|E

5|$|Brain {{activity}} {{is made possible}} by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets. A neuron consists of a <b>cell</b> <b>body,</b> axon, and dendrites. Dendrites are often extensive branches that receive information in the form of signals from the axon terminals of other neurons. The signals received may cause the neuron to initiate an action potential (an electrochemical signal or nerve impulse) which is sent along its axon to the axon terminal, to connect with the dendrites or with the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> of another neuron. An action potential is initiated at the initial segment of an axon, which contains a complex of proteins. When an action potential, reaches the axon terminal it triggers the release of a neurotransmitter at a synapse that propagates a signal that acts on the target cell. These chemical neurotransmitters include dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter. Neurons link at synapses to form pathways and elaborate neural networks, and the activity between them is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E
5|$|The {{human brain}} is {{primarily}} composed of neurons, glial cells, neural stem cells, and blood vessels. Types of neuron include interneurons, pyramidal cells including Betz cells, motor neurons (upper and lower motor neurons), and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Betz cells {{are the largest}} cells (by size of <b>cell</b> <b>body)</b> in the nervous system. The adult human brain is estimated to contain 86±8 billion neurons, with a roughly equal number (85±10 billion) of non-neuronal cells. Out of these neurons, 16 billion (19%) {{are located in the}} cerebral cortex, and 69 billion (80%) are in the cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|Once a neuron is in place, {{it extends}} {{dendrites}} and an axon {{into the area}} around it. Axons, because they commonly extend a great distance from the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> and need to reach specific targets, grow in a particularly complex way. The tip of a growing axon consists of a blob of protoplasm called a growth cone, studded with chemical receptors. These receptors sense the local environment, causing the growth cone to be attracted or repelled by various cellular elements, and thus to be pulled in a particular direction at each point along its path. The result of this pathfinding process is that the growth cone navigates through the brain until it reaches its destination area, where other chemical cues cause it to begin generating synapses. Considering the entire brain, thousands of genes create products that influence axonal pathfinding.|$|E

Aβ deposit area was positively correlated with the frequency of associated neuronal <b>cell</b> <b>bodies,</b> the degree of correlation being greater for pyramidal cells than smaller neurons. These data suggested: (1) the number of closely adjacent neuronal <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> which simultaneously secrete Aβ was an important factor {{determining the}} size of an Aβ deposit and (2) the exponential decline in larger Aβ deposits reflects the low probability that larger numbers of adjacent neurons will secrete Aβ simultaneously to form a deposit. © 1995...|$|R
5|$|One {{reason for}} the {{popularity}} of the local protein synthesis hypothesis is that it provides a possible mechanism for the specificity associated with LTP. Specifically, if indeed local protein synthesis underlies L-LTP, only dendritic spines receiving LTP-inducing stimuli will undergo LTP; the potentiation will not be propagated to adjacent synapses. By contrast, global protein synthesis that occurs in the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> requires that proteins be shipped out to every area of the cell, including synapses that have not received LTP-inducing stimuli. Whereas local protein synthesis provides a mechanism for specificity, global protein synthesis would seem to directly compromise it. However, as discussed later, the synaptic tagging hypothesis successfully reconciles global protein synthesis, synapse specificity, and associativity.|$|E
5|$|The perforant path is {{the main}} output pathway of the entorhinal cortex (EC). The flow of {{information}} in the hippocampus is largely unidirectional. Axons from the pyramidal cells (in EC layer II) perforate the subiculum to project mainly to the granular layer in the dentate gyrus (first synaptic connection). Some axons project to CA3 and a lesser number project to CA1. The dentate granule cell axons, called mossy fibers, pass on the information, to the dendrites of CA3 pyramidal cells (second synaptic connection). From there, CA3 axons called Schaffer collaterals leave the deep part of the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b> and loop up to the apical dendrites and then extend to CA1. Axons from CA1 then project back to the entorhinal cortex (third synaptic connection) completing the trisynaptic loop or circuit.|$|E
5|$|The {{first real}} {{progress}} toward a modern understanding of nervous function, though, came from the investigations of Luigi Galvani, who discovered that a shock of static electricity applied to an exposed nerve of a dead frog could cause its leg to contract. Since that time, each major advance in understanding has followed more or less directly from {{the development of a}} new technique of investigation. Until the early years of the 20th century, the most important advances were derived from new methods for staining cells. Particularly critical was the invention of the Golgi stain, which (when correctly used) stains only a small fraction of neurons, but stains them in their entirety, including <b>cell</b> <b>body,</b> dendrites, and axon. Without such a stain, brain tissue under a microscope appears as an impenetrable tangle of protoplasmic fibers, in which it is impossible to determine any structure. In the hands of Camillo Golgi, and especially of the Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the new stain revealed hundreds of distinct types of neurons, each with its own unique dendritic structure and pattern of connectivity.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanism}} by which target-derived Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) signaling is propagated retrogradely, over extremely long distances, to <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> to support survival of neurons is unclear. Here we show that survival of sympathetic neurons supported by NGF on distal axons requires the kinase activity of the NGF receptor, TrkA, in both distal axons and <b>cell</b> <b>bodies.</b> In contrast, disruption of TrkA activity exclusively in proximal axonal segments affects neither retrograde NGF-TrkA signaling in <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> nor neuronal survival. Ligand-receptor internalization is necessary for survival of neurons supported by NGF on distal axons. Furthermore, antibody neutralization experiments indicate that retrogradely transported NGF, within <b>cell</b> <b>bodies,</b> is critical for neuronal survival but not for growth of distal axons. Taken together, our results indicate that retrogradely transported NGF-TrkA complexes promote sympathetic neuron survival...|$|R
40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{version is}} made available under the CC-BY-NC-ND 4. 0 license [URL] discrete functional classes of enteric neurons in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract {{have been successfully}} distinguished {{on the basis of}} the unique combination of molecules and enzymes in their <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> (“chemical coding”). Whether the same chemical coding exists in varicose axons of different functional classes has not been systematically tested. In this study, we quantified the coexistence of markers that define classes of nerve <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> in the myenteric plexus of the guinea-pig ileum, in varicose axons of the same neurons. Profound differences between the combinations of immunohistochemical markers in myenteric nerve <b>cell</b> <b>bodies</b> and in their varicosities were identified. These discrepancies were particularly notable for classes of neurons that had previously been classified as cholinergic, based on immunoreactivity for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in their <b>cell</b> <b>bodies.</b> To detect cholinergic varicose axons of enteric neurons in this study, we used antiserum against the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT). ChAT-immunoreactivity has been reported to be consistently co-localized with 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) in interneuronal <b>cell</b> <b>bodies,</b> yet only 29  ±  5 % (n =  4) of 5 -HT-immunoreactive varicosities contained vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT).

Comparable discrepancies were also noted for non-cholinergic markers.
