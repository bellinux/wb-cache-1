5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, the New Zealand government authorised the formation of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF), for service at home and abroad. Following <b>consultation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> British government, it was decided that the main New Zealand contribution to the war effort would be {{in the form of an}} infantry division, the 2nd New Zealand Division, which would require nine battalions of infantry. Consequently, several infantry battalions were formed from 1939 to 1940 with New Zealand volunteers.|$|E

5|$|Judges in a High Court are {{appointed}} by the President of India in <b>consultation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Chief Justice of India and {{the governor of the}} state. High Courts are headed by a Chief Justice. The Chief Justices are ranked fourteenth (in their state) and seventeenth (outside their state) in the Indian order of precedence.

After further <b>consultation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lawyer, it was decided to rename the game Magic: The Gathering, thus enabling the name to be trademarked.|$|E

5|$|Affairs quieted {{after the}} initial persecution. Diocletian {{remained}} in Antioch for the following three years. He visited Egypt once, over the winter of 301302, where he began the grain dole in Alexandria. In Egypt, some Manicheans, followers of the prophet Mani, were denounced {{in the presence of}} the proconsul of Africa. On March 31, 302, in a rescript from Alexandria, Diocletian, after <b>consultation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> proconsul for Egypt, ordered that the leading Manicheans be burnt alive along with their scriptures. This was the first time an Imperial persecution ever called for the destruction of sacred literature. Low-status Manicheans were to be executed; high-status Manicheans were to be sent to work in the quarries of Proconnesus (Marmara Island) or the mines of Phaeno. All Manichean property was to be seized and deposited in the imperial treasury.|$|E
5|$|Carucage was {{an attempt}} to secure new sources of revenue to {{supplement}} existing sources of income. It was also intended to increase the royal revenues in the face of new demands placed upon them. Although derived from the older geld, carucage was an experiment in revenue collection, but it was only levied for specific purposes, rather than as a general tax regularly assessed. A novel feature was the <b>consultation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> barons and other leading members of the ruling classes. Despite its intermittent use during the reigns of Richard I, John, and the early years of Henry III, the main source of royal income at that time remained scutage, feudal dues such as feudal reliefs or feudal aids, and royal rights such as the profits from the justice system.|$|E
5|$|Despite this {{development}} work, {{a move to}} a shared stadium in Straiton was again proposed in 2003. Hibs hoped that selling the Easter Road site {{would allow them to}} clear their debts and reduce costs. Club director Rod Petrie commented that any decision would be based on financial grounds and after <b>consultation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fanbase, as the club were not being forced to move. Farmer expressed support for further redeveloping Easter Road, if it could be part of a viable business plan. During the consultation, Farmer said that his main priority was ensuring the club's survival and denied that any deal had been concluded. The consultation found that the fans were largely opposed to the Straiton proposal, which the club eventually abandoned. To remove part of the debt, the club sold some land to the east of the stadium that had previously been used for car parking. Selling players, including Steven Whittaker, Scott Brown, Kevin Thomson and Steven Fletcher, also funded these debts and further work.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to a lack}} of maintenance, the {{protective}} lacquer covering Knife Edge Two Piece degraded and exposed the surface of the sculpture to the elements. This resulted in oxidation of the bronze metal. Subsequent deterioration of the patination and years of graffiti scratched into the surface resulted in further corrosion. The conservation aimed to remove the remaining protective lacquer and surface dirt, and to remove the result of corrosion and oxidation from the sculpture, and take the surface back to the bare metal. Following the removal of graffiti the sculpture was repatinated to return it to its original colour. It was finally waxed with a weatherproof surface to protect it from future damage. The conservation work was undertaken by Rupert Harris Conservation, working in <b>consultation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Henry Moore Foundation. The cost of the conservation was £16,190, with £11,000 contributed by the Henry Moore Foundation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of PedroI the Chamber of Deputies was never {{dissolved}} and legislative sessions were never extended or postponed. Under PedroII, the Chamber of Deputies was only ever dissolved {{at the request of}} the President of the Council of Ministers (Prime minister). There were eleven dissolutions during PedroII's reign and, of these, ten occurred after <b>consultation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Council of State, which was beyond what was required by the Constitution. A Constitutional balance of power existed between the General Assembly and the executive branch under the Emperor. The legislature could not operate alone and the monarch could not force his will upon the Assembly. The system functioned smoothly only when both Assembly and Emperor acted in a spirit of cooperation for the national good.|$|E
5|$|English {{taxation}} {{after the}} Norman Conquest of 1066 {{was based on}} the geld or danegeld, a national tax paid by all free men, those who were not serfs or slaves. The geld {{was based on the}} number of hides of land owned by the taxpayer, and could be demanded by the king and assessed at varying levels without the need for <b>consultation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> barons or other subjects. During King Henry I's reign, an increasing number of exemptions, and the difficulties encountered in collecting the geld, lowered its importance to the Exchequer—the treasury of England. It is unclear whether the geld was collected at all during the reign of Henry's successor, King Stephen. Stephen's successor, King Henry II, collected the geld only twice, once in 1155 and again in 1161–1162. The geld was unpopular, and after 1162 Henry may have felt it politically expedient to stop collecting it.|$|E

5|$|First, the {{assigned}} herald develops a written description based on <b>consultation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> petitioner.

The final step is to prepare the letters patent, the official notice of an award of arms, which includes a drawing of the armorial bearings and the accompanying legal text and explanation of the symbolism of the bearings. Under Canadian bilingualism laws, letters patent are written in both English and French, though the petitioner may choose which language will be placed in the left column of the document.|$|E

Fifthly, the commitment to building a Partnership which would be tailored to the different needs of individual Partners was reaffirmed. In this respect, NATO's intention to place a special focus on relations with {{the states of the}} Caucasus and Central Asia was welcomed, including the decision by the Alliance to appoint one liaison officer for each region. They also welcomed the launching of the Individual Partnership Action Plan process by several states of these two regions.

5|$|In 1958, the Singapore {{strategy}} was revived {{in the form}} of Operation Mastodon, a plan to deploy V bombers of RAF Bomber Command equipped with nuclear weapons to Singapore as part of Britain's contribution to the defence of the region under Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). Once again, there were formidable logistical problems. As the Vbombers could not fly all the way to Singapore, a new staging base was developed at RAF Gan in the Maldives. RAF Tengah's runway was too short for Vbombers, so RAF Butterworth had to be used until it could be lengthened. The basing of nuclear armed aircraft, and the stockpiling of nuclear weapons without <b>consultation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> local authorities soon ran into political complications.|$|E
