As the FKEE students, dealing with ICs has become a norm. However, the IC tester used in laboratory to verify {{the availability of the}} ICs is big, not portable, heavy and expensive. Thus, a hand-held IC tester is developed to test common ICs used in the laboratory. In this project, the microcontroller used is PIC 18 F 4525 to control the operation of the system. In addition, it is equipped with a numerical keypad, keypad encoder, IC socket, liquid crystal display screen, beeper and a 9 V cell battery power supply. The ICs to-be-tested will be placed into IC socket. The code of the IC will be keyed in by using the keypad. Then, the outcome of the test will be shown at the LCD screen and beeper to indicate the status of the ICs. The system is compact, portable and can test various forms of 20 pins ICs such as basic logic gate, multiplexer, de-multiplexer, encoder, decoder, <b>counter,</b> <b>flip-flop,</b> and etc...|$|E

50|$|After their {{introduction}} in {{integrated circuit}} form in 1963 by Sylvania, TTL integrated circuits were manufactured by several semiconductor companies. The 7400 series (also called 74xx) by Texas Instruments became particularly popular. TTL manufacturers offered {{a wide range}} of logic gate, <b>flip-flops,</b> <b>counters,</b> and other circuits. Several variations of the original TTL circuit design were developed. The variations offered interchangeable functions that had higher speed or lower power dissipation to allow design optimization. TTL devices were originally made in ceramic and plastic dual-in-line (DIP) packages, and flat-pack form. TTL chips are now also made in surface-mount packages.|$|R

40|$|Some {{methods of}} {{fabrication}} make it economically attractive to construct counters (and other devices) by connecting sets of identical flip-flops(FFs), if the FFs {{have a common}} clock input, the state transitions of the whole counters are as rapid as the state transitions of each FFs, so that the counter is further restricted to be synchronous. In order to simplify the process for analysis of synchronous <b>counters</b> constructed with <b>flip-flops,</b> a simple and successful method is proposed. Using this method, the state transition equations obtained from logic diagram of counter are converted to standard sum-of-products forms(SOPs). By finding out the logic principle for achieving the value of logic function based on the standard SOPs, the values of next state can be directly obtained without any Boolean calculation.
