As the FKEE students, dealing with ICs has become a norm. However, the IC tester used in laboratory to verify {{the availability of the}} ICs is big, not portable, heavy and expensive. Thus, a hand-held IC tester is developed to test common ICs used in the laboratory. In this project, the microcontroller used is PIC 18 F 4525 to control the operation of the system. In addition, it is equipped with a numerical keypad, keypad encoder, IC socket, liquid crystal display screen, beeper and a 9 V cell battery power supply. The ICs to-be-tested will be placed into IC socket. The code of the IC will be keyed in by using the keypad. Then, the outcome of the test will be shown at the LCD screen and beeper to indicate the status of the ICs. The system is compact, portable and can test various forms of 20 pins ICs such as basic logic gate, multiplexer, de-multiplexer, encoder, decoder, <b>counter,</b> <b>flip-flop,</b> and etc...|$|E

40|$|Some {{methods of}} {{fabrication}} make it economically attractive to construct counters (and other devices) by connecting sets of identical flip-flops(FFs), if the FFs {{have a common}} clock input, the state transitions of the whole counters are as rapid as the state transitions of each FFs, so that the counter is further restricted to be synchronous. In order to simplify the process for analysis of synchronous <b>counters</b> constructed with <b>flip-flops,</b> a simple and successful method is proposed. Using this method, the state transition equations obtained from logic diagram of counter are converted to standard sum-of-products forms(SOPs). By finding out the logic principle for achieving the value of logic function based on the standard SOPs, the values of next state can be directly obtained without any Boolean calculation. Analysis for a 3 -bits counter shows that this method eliminates complex calculations， and makes the process of obtaining next state value and developing truth table more rapid and convenient...|$|R
