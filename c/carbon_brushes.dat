25|$|In 1937 the Army, {{faced with}} the {{continuing}} supply problems with the Norden, once again turned to Sperry Gyroscope {{to see if they}} could come up with a solution. Their earlier models had all proved unreliable, but they had continued working with the designs throughout this period and had addressed many of the problems. By 1937, Orland Esval had introduced a new AC-powered electrical gyroscope that spun at 30,000 RPM, compared to the Norden's 7,200, which dramatically improved the performance of the inertial platform. The use of three-phase AC power and inductive pickup eliminated the <b>carbon</b> <b>brushes,</b> and further simplified the design. Carl Frische had developed a new system to automatically level the platform, eliminating the time-consuming process needed on the Norden. The two collaborated on a new design, adding a second gyro to handle heading changes, and named the result the Sperry S-1. Existing supplies of Nordens continued to be supplied to the USAAC's B-17s, while the S-1 equipped the B-24Es being sent to the 15th Air Force.|$|E

It is the electromechanical that connect the circuit to generate an electric motor. Mineral graphite always used as a raw material in producing <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> beside the uses of charcoal. This study is propose to use a coconut shell (CS) as waste material that can be recycle and sustainable to produce a carbon pre-cursor. This research is conducted to minimize the percentage of graphite or charcoal as a raw material in producing a <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> by replaced a CS as a raw material and produce a <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> for railway application. Several process such as baking, crushing, sieving, mixing, compacting and sintering are {{used in this study}} to produce a <b>carbon</b> <b>brush.</b> The formation of the carbon (C) had been produced by reaction of combustion in nitrogen atmosphere with 8000 C temperature to produce carbon pre-cursor. The <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> sample then been prepared by mixing a copper powder and epoxy resin with different ratio of mixture. The suitable percentage of epoxy resin that could form a solid cylindrical shape was 15 %. Sample of <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> had been baked at 8000 C to form the highest carbon. In this study, copper powder can produce a better conductivity where the sample can permit current flow through it.

40|$|Abstract. A {{new type}} of {{tachometer}} <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> wear detection technology is proposed based on data acquisition and signal processing technology, the key {{of which is that}} the tachometer <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> output information is acquired and processed, moreover, the real time conditions of the <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> wear are detected and analyzed based on the time domain Eigen value analysis method. During the data processing process, the results of the dimensional parameter processing method are compared with the results of the dimensionless parameter processing method at the same time. Then, we find that the detecting precision is greatly promoted and measurement probability is guaranteed by reasonable threshold selection. Experimental results indicate that the technology proposed here has high stability, high reliability, and high detecting probability, which has great practical value and deserves being extended widely...|$|R

50|$|The {{softness}} of <b>carbon</b> <b>brushes</b> permits direct radial end-contact with the commutator without {{damage to the}} segments, permitting easy reversal of rotor direction, without the need to reorient the brush holders for operation in the opposite direction. Although never reversed, common appliance motors that use wound rotors, commutators and brushes have radial-contact brushes. In {{the case of a}} reaction-type carbon brush holder, <b>carbon</b> <b>brushes</b> may be reversely inclined with the commutator so that the commutator tends to push against the carbon for firm contact.|$|E

40|$|A new precise {{chemical}} method {{has been developed}} for the compositional analysis of <b>carbon</b> <b>brush.</b> The major chemical constituents of <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> are <b>carbon</b> (C), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and tin (Sn), while the minor constituents are silica (SiO 2), iron (Fe), and molybdenum (Me). The analytical techniques employed for graphitic carbon, Pb, Sn, and SiO 2 analysis were gravimetry (Loss in ignition, as PbSO 4. as metastannic acid, and as SiO 2, respectively) and titremetry for copper (lodimetry). Trace impurities of Fe and Mo were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). On the same sample, gravimetric methods as above have been compared for Cu (as cuprous thiocyanate) by gravimetry and for Pb and Sn by normal titremetry (EDTA with xylenol orange as indicator). XRD confirmed the presence of graphitic <b>carbon</b> in <b>carbon</b> <b>brush.</b> The major constituents (w/w %) of <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> for Cu. C, Pb, Sn, and SiO 2 {{were found to be}} 40. 5 +/- 0. 3, 39. 5 +/- 0. 25, 9. 5 +/- 0. 10, 10. 2 +/- 0. 13, and 0. 45 +/- 0. 07, respectively, and minor constituents Fe and Mo were found to be 4. 2 +/- 0. 21 and 1. 6 +/- 0. 2 mg kg(- 1), respectively. The titremetry Cu results obtained are comparable by gravimetry, which were 40. 8 +/- 0. 5. The gravimetric results obtained for Pb and Sn are comparable by titremetry and FAAS results of SiO 2, which were 9. 3 +/- 0. 30, 10. 1 +/- 0. 2, and 0. 25 +/- 0. 09 (w/w %), respectively.

40|$|The anode {{electrode}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important components in all microbial electrochemical technologies (METs). Anode materials pretreatment and modification have been shown to be an effective method of improving anode performance. According to mass loss analysis during carbon fiber heating, five temperatures (300, 450, 500, 600, and 750 °C) were selected as the pre-heating temperatures of <b>carbon</b> fiber <b>brush</b> anodes. Microbial fuel cell (MFC) reactors built up with these pre-heated <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> anodes performed with different power densities and Coulombic efficiencies (CEs). Two kinds of measuring methods for power density were applied, and the numerical values of maximum power densities diverged greatly. Reactors with 450 °C anodes, using both methods, had the highest power densities, and the highest CEs were found using 500 °C anode reactors. The surface elements of heat-treated carbon fibers were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), and C, O, and N were the main constituents of the carbon fiber. There were four forms of N 1 s at the surface of the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) -based carbon fiber, and their concentrations were different at different temperature samples. The microbial community of the anode surface was analyzed, and microbial species on anodes from every sample were similar. The differences in anode performance may be caused by mass loss and by the surface elements. For <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> anodes used in MFCs or other BESs, 450 – 500 °C preheating was the most suitable temperature range in terms of the power densities and CEs...|$|R

30|$|Compared with DFIG, PMSG has no <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> {{and slip}} ring, so the {{maintenance}} performance {{is better than}} DFIG [9]. Specifically, the harmonic frequency of the stator output current is stable and easy to control [10]. Besides, the generator and the power grid are isolated by the full power converter, {{so there is no}} current impact and the power grid adaptability is stronger [11]. However, due {{to the use of the}} full power converter, the converter has large capacity, large volume, and high loss, which brings about high cost of manufacturing and operation [12]. In addition, the converter has been the higher failure rate component of the PMSG, which reduces the reliability and increases the maintenance cost of the PMSG [13].|$|R
50|$|Like {{his successors}} after him, the company founder Ludwig Schunk {{endeavored}} {{to expand and}} shore up his company through diversification into related fields of technology. To that end, he in 1923 acquired a <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> holder factory and integrated it into his operations in Heuchelheim. In 1932 the production of sintered bearings was started. The carbon orientation had already previously been expanded with products for mechanical applications. The increasingly difficult economic environment could not prevent Ludwig Schunk's life work from advancing. As the Reichsmark lost ever more of its value and the concomitant heavy inflation increased as well, Schunk successfully sought new sales markets abroad from which stable currency flowed in. By boosting his export business he succeeded in avoiding losses of real assets for his company.|$|R
50|$|The high {{resistance}} or <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> is made {{large enough}} that it is significantly wider than the insulating segment that it spans (and on large machines may often span two insulating segments). The result {{of this is that}} as the commutator segment passes from under the brush, the current passing to it ramps down more smoothly than had been the case with pure copper brushes where the contact broke suddenly. Similarly the segment coming into contact with the brush has a similar ramping up of the current. Thus, although the current passing through the brush was more or less constant, the instantaneous current passing to the two commutator segments was proportional to the relative area in contact with the brush.|$|R
50|$|Manufacturing of <b>carbon</b> <b>brushes</b> {{requires}} an in-depth knowledge {{of materials and}} experience in mixture compositions. Very small changes in brush contents by just a few percent of components by weight can significantly change the properties of brushes on their applications. There are {{just a handful of}} brush developing companies in the world, which are mostly specialized on certain types of brushes.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of the carbon brush had convenient side effects. <b>Carbon</b> <b>brushes</b> tend to wear more evenly than copper brushes, and the soft carbon causes far less damage to the commutator segments. There is less sparking with carbon as compared to copper, and as the carbon wears away, the higher resistance of carbon results in fewer problems from the dust collecting on the commutator segments.|$|E
50|$|Advantages of a brushed DC motor include low initial cost, high reliability, {{and simple}} control of motor speed. Disadvantages are high {{maintenance}} and low life-span for high intensity uses. Maintenance involves regularly replacing the <b>carbon</b> <b>brushes</b> and springs which carry the electric current, {{as well as}} cleaning or replacing the commutator. These components are necessary for transferring electrical power from outside the motor to the spinning wire windings of the rotor inside the motor. Brushes consist of conductors.|$|E
50|$|Wireless {{slip rings}} do {{not rely on}} the typical {{friction}} based metal and <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> contact methods that have been employed by slip rings since their invention, such as those explored above. Instead, they transfer both power and data wirelessly via an electromagnetic field, which is created by the coils that are placed in the rotating receiver, and the stationary transmitter. Wireless slip rings are considered an upgrade from - or alternative to - traditional slip rings, as their lack of standard mechanical rotating parts means they're typically more resilient in harsh operating environments, and require less maintenance and upkeep. However, the amount of power that can be transmitted between coils is limited; typically a traditional contact-type slip ring can transmit orders of magnitude more power in the same volume.|$|R
30|$|Large-scale wind {{turbines}} {{have become the}} trend of the wind power industry. However, the main factors restricting the large scale {{wind turbines}} are frequent replacement of <b>carbon</b> <b>brush</b> and slip ring and the harmonic of the stator current in double-fed induction generator, plus converters’ large volume, high cost, and high failure rate in full power converter of wind turbine. Therefore, new double rotor speed-regulating wind power generation system comprising a double rotor speed-regulating device connected to the gearbox and the synchronous generator is proposed {{for the sake of}} lower cost, higher reliability, and stronger adaptability of the power grid. The structure of the system and the connection of each component are described; meanwhile, the working principle of the system under different operating conditions is analyzed. Furthermore, the mathematical model of the system is established, besides the control strategy being proposed. The simulation results verify the correctness of the mathematical model and the control strategy.|$|R
