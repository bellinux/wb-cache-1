We estimated the concentration of the dye molecules held {{in the core of}} LCNEs from transmission spectrum. As a result, it was revealed that the dye molecules are released from the core of LCNEs below the characteristic release-temperature on cooling. Moreover, the depolarized static light scattering measurement was performed to estimate the Isotropic-Nematic(I-N) phase transition temperature of low molecular weight liquid crystals in the core of LCNEs. By controlling mixing ratio of binary liquid crystalline mixture, we tuned theI-N phase transition temperature. The release-temperature completely corresponds to the I-N phase transition temperature in <b>the</b> <b>coreof</b> LCNEswithin <b>the</b> whole mixing ratio.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{this work}} {{we present a}} {{computational}} approach {{to the design of}} nanostructures made of structural motifs taken from left-handed b-helical proteins. Previously, we suggested a structural model based on the self-assembly of motifs taken from Escherichia coli galactoside acetyltransferase (Protein DataBank 1 krr, chain A, residues 131 – 165, denoted krr 1), which produced a very stable nanotube in molecular dynamics simulations. Here we modify this model by changing the charge distribution in <b>the</b> inner <b>coreof</b> <b>the</b> systemand testing theeffect of this changeon thestructural arrangement of the construct. Our results demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} generate the proper conditions for charge transfer inside nanotubes based on assemblies of krr 1 segment. The electronic transfer would be achieved by introducing different histidine ionization states in selected positions of the internal core of the construct, in addition to specific mutations with charged amino acids that altogether will allow the formation of coherent net-works of aromatic ring stacking, salt-bridges, and hydrogen bonds...|$|R

50|$|Spot welding {{involves}} three stages; {{the first}} of which involves <b>the</b> <b>electrodes</b> being brought {{to the surface of the}} metal and applying a slight amount of pressure. The current from <b>the</b> <b>electrodes</b> is then applied briefly after which the current is removed but <b>the</b> <b>electrodes</b> remain in place for the material to cool.

50|$|During re{{charging}}, the charger applies a high DC voltage, usually around 150-200 volts, to <b>the</b> <b>electrode,</b> charging it with electrostatic charge.

50|$|For this to work, {{the cell}} {{capacitance}} must {{be higher than}} <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> capacitance by at least an order of magnitude.

If <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> capacitance is much {{less than that of}} the cell, then when current is passed through <b>the</b> <b>electrode,</b> <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> voltage will change faster than the cell voltage. Thus, when current is injected and then turned off (at the end of a duty cycle), <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> voltage will decay faster than the cell voltage. As soon as <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> voltage asymptotes to the cell voltage, the voltage can be sampled (again) and the next amount of charge applied.

500|$|To {{strike the}} {{electric}} arc, <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> {{is brought into}} contact with the workpiece by a very light touch with <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> to <b>the</b> base metal then is pulled back slightly. This initiates the arc and thus the melting of the workpiece and <b>the</b> consumable <b>electrode,</b> and causes droplets of <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> to be passed from <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> to <b>the</b> weld pool. Striking an arc, which varies widely based upon electrode and workpiece composition, can be the hardest skill for beginners. The orientation of <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> to workpiece is where most stumble, if <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> is held at a perpendicular angle to the workpiece the tip will likely stick to the metal which will fuse <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> to <b>the</b> workpiece which will cause it to heat up very rapidly. The tip of <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> needs to be at a lower angle to the workpiece, which allows the weld pool to flow out of the arc. [...] As <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> melts, <b>the</b> flux covering disintegrates, giving off shielding gases that protect the weld area from oxygen and other atmospheric gases. In addition, the flux provides molten slag which covers the filler metal as it travels from <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> to <b>the</b> weld pool. Once part of the weld pool, the slag floats to the surface and protects the weld from contamination as it solidifies. Once hardened, it must be chipped away to reveal the finished weld. As welding progresses and <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> melts, <b>the</b> welder must periodically stop welding to remove <b>the</b> remaining <b>electrode</b> stub and insert a new <b>electrode</b> into <b>the</b> <b>electrode</b> holder.
