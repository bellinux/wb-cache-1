500|$|On June 25, 2009, American {{entertainer}} Michael Jackson {{died while}} Beyoncé was touring. His death {{led her to}} perform tributes to Jackson at tour venues, including Atlanta, Georgia on July 1, 2009; and New Orleans, Louisiana on July 3, 2009. During the tribute, an image of Jackson was shown on the main screen. As Beyoncé sang an emotional rendition of [...] "Halo", she changed the lyrics to [...] "Michael I <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> Halo / I pray your music won't fade away". On January 12, 2010, Haiti was struck by an earthquake. A charity telethon called [...] took place on January 22, 2010, in which many artists, including Beyoncé, participated. She performed an acoustic version of [...] "Halo" [...] with Coldplay's lead vocalist Chris Martin playing the piano. To make the song match the night's purpose, Beyoncé weaved [...] "Haiti" [...] into its lyrics, singing [...] "Haiti, we <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> halo / You know you're my saving grace / You're everything I need and more, it's written all over your face / Haiti, we <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> halo / I pray you won't fade away". This version was included on the 2010 live album Hope for Haiti Now.|$|E
500|$|... {{with the}} lines: [...] "Remember those walls I built? Well, baby, they're {{tumbling}} down". She sings the introduction {{in a low}} register, {{and the power of}} her voice gradually increases as the song progresses. In the pre-chorus, she chants, [...] "Everywhere I'm looking now, I'm surrounded by your embrace, baby I <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> halo, you know you're my saving grace, you're everything I need and more, it's written all over your face". Beyoncé then echoes the word [...] "halo" [...] in the chorus; the third and final one is preceded by a 1980s drum breakdown, and is complemented by sweeping strings and percussion.|$|E
500|$|Greatest Hits: My Prerogative {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics. James Griffiths of The Guardian commented: [...] "Here comes the Queen of Pop {{in a box}} so shiny you <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> face in it. Spears is described on the cover as 'the ultimate video performer', and watching the 20 promos contained within, it's difficult to argue. [...] Relentlessly thrusting herself at the camera, compulsively preening amid special FX galas, Britney is the MTV video age in human form." [...] He also complimented the innovations of the menu, but added that [...] "it's not particularly impressive" [...] and [...] "you need to be pretty nifty with your handset to find them." [...] Music Week said: [...] "The DVD version of Spears' high-flying 'best of' set adds bells and whistles to the audio version at only a slight premium pricewise. Twenty promo videos are included, all with top-notch sound and vision". AllMusic gave the video {{four and a half}} stars out of five. Rolling Stone graded it with three out of five stars.|$|E

500|$|The {{installment}} {{was filmed}} {{and set in}} Los Angeles, California, as were all other Awake episodes. During filming of the installment, Isaacs {{thought it would be}} funny to moon down the stairs during a scene in which Hannah and Michael go nude swimming, but stated that it would probably break the Standards and Practices law. Filming of the episode commenced at an actual campus swimming pool for one scene. A lady present during filming asked if Isaacs was naked. Isaacs replied that he was not completely naked, but had a [...] "small piece of material taped over [...] genitals"; the lady said [...] "That's naked," [...] adding [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> butt crack." [...] In response, Isaacs [...] "taped a piece of material over [...] butt crack". When the last scene was filmed that day, he ran up the stairs, causing the material—which had been secured only by a piece of sealing tape—to fall off. The woman was [...] "furious". Isaacs thought that the team of Awake would have to withdraw the footage, but was happy to see that part was included in the finished episode.|$|E
2500|$|The group held a rally {{outside of}} Lamont on Friday September 17, 2012, announcing support for library workers, holding signs, and {{chanting}} (e.g., [...] "Hey, Harvard, you can't hide / We <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> greedy side!") Occupiers inside the library left the same day, as planned. Demonstrations around Harvard's libraries and library workers continued through Commencement 2012.|$|E
2500|$|After 14 nights, at 4:27 a.m., rescuers Glenn Burns, Donovan Lightfoot and Royce Gill {{finally reached}} the men, one of them yelling [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> light" [...] when he broke through the ground which was {{separating}} him from the miners, to which the miners replied [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> light too". Brant Webb was freed at 4:47 a.m. on 9 May, followed by Todd Russell at 4:54 a.m. They were driven up the spiral decline of the mine, arriving at a medical station {{at the base of}} the vertical shaft from the surface at about 5:30 a.m. They were checked by a doctor, and then sent up the lift towards the surface. About thirty metres from the surface, they got out of their wheelchairs, which were moved to the rear of the lift so as to be out of sight. At 5:58 a.m. both men walked out of the lift cage unaided [...] "...punching their fists in the air to the cheers of the Beaconsfield crowds who had gathered outside the mine gate.|$|E

2500|$|Filippo {{sees them}} in the {{distance}} and, believing she is avoiding him, confronts her. He questions her, regarding her as unfaithful: [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> guilty thoughts", he says. In a duet, he admits that his jealousy {{is due to the}} power she has, but confronts her with proof of her support for her subjects' protests by producing some secret papers stolen from her apartment. She responds that she will listen to the peoples' complaints and confronts him: Se amar non puoi, rispettami / [...] "If you cannot love me, respect me! At least leave my honour intact!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On Monday, November 28, 2011, Occupy Harvard {{conducted}} a [...] "Rally to Defend Freedom of Speech" [...] in Harvard Yard. The group expressed solidarity with UC Berkeley and UC Davis, where students had recently come {{into conflict with}} police. About 25 of the demonstrators proceeded from the Yard to a Goldman Sachs recruiting session, behind held at Harvard's [...] "On-Campus Interview Facility". They stood outside and chanted [...] "Goldman Sachs, you can't hide / We <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> greedy side!" [...] Students who attempted to enter were denied access to the building by Harvard Police and Office of Career Services officials, even after showing identity cards.|$|E
2500|$|The Fountainhead {{went on to}} gross $2.1 million, $400,000 {{less than}} its {{production}} budget. Sales of Rand's novel, however, increased {{as a direct result}} of the public's interest spurred by the film. In letters written at the time, the author's reaction was positive, saying [...] "The picture is more faithful to the novel than any other adaptation of a novel that Hollywood has ever produced" [...] and [...] "It was a real triumph." [...] She conceded to friend DeWitt Emery that [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> point in feeling that Gary Cooper's performance should have been stronger," [...] but concluded, [...] "I would rather see the part underplayed than overdone by some phony-looking ham." [...] However, she displayed a more negative attitude towards it later, saying that she [...] "disliked the movie from beginning to end", and complaining about its editing, acting, and other elements. As a result of this film, Rand said that she would never sell any of her novels to a film company that did not allow her the right to pick the director and screenwriter as well as edit the film, as she did not want to encounter the same production problems that occurred on this film.|$|E
