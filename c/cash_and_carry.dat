25|$|The {{idea for}} the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in Ghana was {{conceived}} by former president John Kufuor who when seeking {{the mandate of the}} people in the 2000 elections, promised to abolish the <b>cash</b> <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> system of health delivery. Under the <b>cash</b> <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> system, the health need of an individual was only attended to after initial payment for the service was made. Even in cases when patients had been brought into the hospital on emergencies it was required that money was paid at every point of service delivery.|$|E

25|$|Like all {{insurance}} schemes, {{different types}} of premiums are available under the country's NHIS. Ghanaian contributors are grouped according to their levels of income. Based on the group a Ghanaian contributor may fall in, there is specific premium {{that ought to be}} paid. This was done since the socio-economic condition scheme contributors is not the same and the Ghanaian contributions was to be affordable for all to ensure that nobody is forced to remain in <b>cash</b> <b>and</b> <b>carry</b> system. This meant that Ghanaian contributions payable could vary from one district to the other as even the disease burden was also not the same in all the districts. To ensure that all Ghanaian citizens made some contribution to the scheme, a 2.5% Health Insurance Levy on selected goods and services was passed into law so that the money collected could be put into a National Health Insurance Fund to subsidize fully paid contributions to the District Health Insurance Schemes.|$|E
