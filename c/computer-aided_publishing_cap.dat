40|$|UK Policy for the {{certification}} {{and operation of}} UAV Systems, both military and civil, was first <b>published</b> in <b>CAP</b> 722 [1] in May 2002. Under this policy, the principles established for civil manned aircraft are extended to civil UAV systems, including the need for system to be certificated to a code of airworthiness and organisations involved in the design, manufacture, maintenance or operation of a civil UAV system to be approved for the purpose. Since <b>publishing</b> <b>CAP</b> 722, the CAA has further reviewed and developed its UAV policy, both {{in the light of}} recent experiences {{and as a result of}} changes in regulatory responsibilities since the formation of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The regulations governing civil UAV Systems below 150 kg have in particular been targeted in this review, as the responsibility for both airworthiness and operations remains vested with national aviation authorities. The CAA also recognised that this category of UAV has potential for early applications, and yet may find difficulty in complying with the principles of CAP 722. To address civil light UAV Systems, the UK CAA has developed a new policy, and it is this policy that is the subject of this paper. The UK Light UAV Systems Policy will ensure that acceptable safety standards are maintained whilst providing a route for the routine operation of light civil UAV Systems. Exemptions to UK national regulations may be granted to civil UAV Systems that can demonstrate compliance with the policy and show equivalence in terms of safety risk to existing model aircraft. Not all civil UAVs below 150 kg will meet the applicability criteria or qualify for an exemption under the Light UAV Systems policy. For those UAVs, the general policy contained in CAP 722 will still apply. 1...|$|R

It is argued that the magnetotail is highly time dependent.

During northward interplanetary conditions more field lines are apt to close near the earth leaving considerably less flux to form any extended tail. Using estimates for both the amount of open polar cap flux and the tail flux at 60 earth radii, it is argued that at 200 earth radii either the tail cross section is elongated in the equatorial plane or the average radius is not more than 25 earth radii...|$|R

While one has to agree with most of his points, I find his predictions gloomy enough to wish I could disagree. Luckily, Mitchell has chosen to address what the majority of the profession (and many architectural schools) currently consider to be CAD. It turns out that this CAD is not what CAD is supposed to be. I have, therefore, purposely chosen a title which appears to echo an opposite view. My intention is not to express disagreement but rather to project the other face of CAD, in my own mind, the only CAD which deserves the name. Whether the current CAD should or will be called CAD in the future is of non-essential significance. As teachers of architectural design we need to be concerned that architectural CAD remains, to date, a very immature field. It is CAD only by name, since a true CAD system has yet to be'discoveredi. This presentation consists of three major sections. The first reviews why the currently available CAD systems do not have the ingredients which may justify them as design oriented machines. This discussion leads to the identification of architectural modelling and knowledge systems as the two main areas which need to be researched so that they may offer the basis for the development of truly design oriented machines. Each is discussed under a separate section, but the point is also made that the two should work hand-in-hand and should be integrated into a completely unified system...|$|R

Parameters required to initialize the model and remotely sensed SST (from advanced very high resolution radiometer images) were available for spring 1983, from data collected as part of the Organization of Persistent Upwelling Structures (OPUS) study. Some examples of the spatial extent of new production are illustrated using false color images, and temporal variability is shown by the time series of depth- and area-integrated nitrate uptake obtained from eight images. The model results are compared with shipboard data for three different upwelling conditions that occurred during OPUS- 83, along with the model results and data <b>published</b> for <b>Cap</b> Blanc. These two regions, Point Conception and Cap Blanc, represent two ends of a spectrum of coastal upwelling performance, with low new production at Point Conception and less effective conversion of available nitrate into particulate nitrogen biomass in contrast to the high levels of new production at Cap Blanc. The daily new production at the Point Conception upwelling center is about 10 % of the Cap Blanc new production, both estimated from the remote-sensing model and satellite-derived SSTs. The model is shown to work well for both extremes and should therefore be suitable for intermediate situations. The long-term objective is to produce a model which can be used for coastal upwelling systems globally to provide a estimate of new production from remotely sensed data in these important areas and to assist in understanding the role of these coastal systems in the air-sea exchange of biogeochemical elements...|$|R
40|$|Research {{articles}} on the prognosis of stroke patients were analysed to identify studies that met sound methodological principles of prognostic research {{as well as to}} identify variables capable of predicting functional outcome (ADL) after stroke. Data sources comprised a <b>computer-aided</b> search of <b>published</b> prognostic studies and references to literature used in prognostic studies. Seventy-eight studies were tested for adherence to the following key methodological criteria: reliability and validity of measurement instruments used to assess dependent and independent variables; inclusion of an inception cohort; adequate and uniform end-point of observation; control for drop-outs during period of observation; statistical testing of presumed relationship between dependent and independent variables; sufficient sample size in relation to number of determinants; control for multicollinearity; specification of patient characteristics (i. e. age, type, recurrent stroke and localization of stroke); description of interfering treatment effects during the period of observation; and cross-validation of the prediction model in a second independent group of patients. Only three studies satisfied nine out of 11 criteria and ten studies eight criteria for the determination of valid prognostic research. The results of these studies indicate that the following variables are valid predictors for functional recovery after stroke: age; previous stroke; urinary continence; consciousness at onset; disorientation in time and place; severity of paralysis; sitting balance; admission ADL score; level of social support and metabolic rate of glucose outside the infarct area in hypertensive patients.

Evidence Acquisition We evaluated guidelines provided by the infectious diseases society of America (IDSA) for the management of community-acquired pneumonia (<b>CAP),</b> <b>published</b> in 2007, and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) published in 2005. We also reviewed literature published from January 2005 to December 2015 using PubMed to evaluate how the treatment of these types of pneumonia have evolved. Results Through our literature review, it was found that despite the advances made in the diagnosis and management of both CAP and HAP, it remains a significant challenge to diagnose and often treat. Two new IV antibiotics (tigecycline and ceftaroline) introduced for the management of CAP and telavancin was approved for HAP. Moreover, treatment of these two types of pneumonia often involves being creative with antimicrobial therapy due to the increasing multi-drug resistance. Conclusions CAP/HAP remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. Bacterial resistance is increasing and adds to the difficulty in treating these patients.

40|$|Absorption {{of radio}} {{waves in the}} polar {{ionosphere}} near the magnetic noon was observed on October 8, 1991, by the 30 MHz imaging riometer at Ny-Alesund, Svalbard (invariant latitude 76. 1 °). These observations showed that the initially widespread absorption features became localized and enhanced in the high-latitude sector {{of the field of}} view, and followed a poleward motion. This behavior occurred quasi-periodically and repeated every 10 – 20 min. Simultaneous observations by EISCAT “Polar” experiments showed that nine discrete plasma patches, with F-region electron density enhanced by an order of 106 el/cm 3, drifted poleward from the polar cusp to the cap during the same period. This coincidence suggested that the ionospheric absorption was associated with F-region plasma patches in the polar cap. Theoretical absorption values of 0. 14 dB, estimated using the electron densities and the electron-ion collision frequencies from the EISCAT F-region plasma data, are smaller than the observed values (< 0. 8 dB). This discrepancy {{may be related to the}} difference between the theoretically- and experimentally-determined collision frequencies, as indicated by Wang et al. (1994). These localized, enhanced, and poleward drifting absorption features over Ny-Alesund may be explained as F-region plasma patches produced by a magnetosheath-like particle precipitation into the cusp, and as small-scale irregularities caused by density gradients of the patches drifting into the polar <b>cap.</b> <b>Published</b> Open Access with SpringerOpen...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Sweden has an {{extensive}} {{child and adolescent}} psychiatric (CAP) research tradition in which longitudinal methods are used to study juvenile delinquency. Up to the 1980 s, results from descriptions and follow-ups of cohorts of CAP patients showed that children's behavioural disturbances or disorders and school problems, together with dysfunctional family situations, were {{the main reasons for}} families, children, and youth to seek help from CAP units. Such factors were also related to registered criminality and registered alcohol and drug abuse in former CAP patients as adults. This study investigated the risk for patients treated 1975 – 1990 to be registered as criminals until the end of 2003. Methods A regional sample of 1, 400 former CAP patients, whose treatment occurred between 1975 and 1990, was followed to 2003, using database-record links to the Register of Persons Convicted of Offences at the National Council for Crime Prevention (NCCP). Results Every third CAP patient treated between 1975 and 1990 (every second man and every fifth woman) had entered the Register of Persons Convicted of Offences during the observation period, which is a significantly higher rate than the general population. Conclusion Results were compared to <b>published</b> results for <b>CAP</b> patients who were treated between 1953 and 1955 and followed over 20 years. Compared to the group of CAP patients from the 1950 s, the results indicate that the risk for boys to enter the register for criminality has doubled and for girls, the risk seems to have increased sevenfold. The reasons for this change are discussed. Although hypothetical and perhaps speculative this higher risk of later criminality {{may be the result of}} lack of social control due to (1) rising consumption of alcohol, (2) changes in organisation of child social welfare work, (3) the school system, and (4) CAP methods that were implemented since 1970. </p...|$|R
40|$|Solar Turbines Gas Compressor Engineering Division of San Diego, California {{called upon}} the Mechanical Engineering {{students}} of California Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo to provide recommendations for optimization of compressor end cap port design. Various sizes of compressors have end caps with numerous ports that exchange fluids between {{the inside and}} outside of the working fluid pressure vessel. Because so many ports must exist on the end caps, unusual flow paths are created to supply the appropriate location within the compressor. These flow paths commonly consist of a drilled inlet hole which intersects with a sudden expansion. The sudden expansion is deemed the “fly cut” because of its semicircular shape. Sudden expansions in general cause very high energy losses in fluid flow. This is one of the primary concerns when designing the compressor end cap port layout. Due to the unusual nature of the fly cuts found in Solar Turbines’ end <b>caps,</b> <b>published</b> information on the pressure losses for this particular flow path do not exist. For this reason, Solar Turbines were required to base their port design on the best information available, including: historical compressor design methods, conservative design analysis estimates, and computational fluid mechanics software. Of these options, the computational method could provide the best estimate but only if validated experimentally. In response to this problem, PreFlow Systems was formed and investigated the solution of designing, building, and testing a scaled experimental test apparatus. This report outlines the details involved in every aspect of the project, including: technical specifications and objectives, design conceptualization, engineering analysis, manufacturing, testing, and results. Each of these phases was crucial in creating the final flow test apparatus which simulated the gas port flow of Solar Turbines’ compressor end caps. This apparatus ultimately provided an experimental basis for concluding that computation fluid mechanics software is a reasonable aide in end cap port design...|$|R
40|$|Reviews on the {{clinical}} performance of vital pulp treatment strategies and capping materials repeatedly showed an insufficient grade of evidence concerning their therapeutic validity. The biological mechanisms underlying the regenerative potential of pulp-dentin complex have {{attracted much attention}} {{during the last two}} decades, since new pulp treatment modalities have been designed and tested at the preclinical level. It has been recognized that evaluation should be based on the specific ability of therapeutic interventions to signal recruitment and differentiation of odontoblast-like cells forming a matrix in a predentin-like pattern, rather than uncontrolled hard tissue deposition in a scar-like form. The aim of the present article was to critically review data from histological experimental studies on pulp <b>capping,</b> <b>published</b> during the last 7 decades. A comprehensive literature search covering the period from 1949 to 2015 was done using the Medline/Pubmed database. Inclusion of a study was dependent on having sufficient data regarding the type of capping material used and the unit of observation (human permanent tooth in vivo or animal permanent dentition; primary teeth were excluded). The post-operatively deposited matrix was categorized into three types: unspecified, osteotypic, or dentin-like matrix. One hundred fifty-two studies were included in the final evaluation. Data from the present systematic review have shown that only 30. 2 % of the 152 experimental histological pulp capping studies described the heterogenic nature of the hard tissue bridge formation, including osteotypic and tubular mineralized tissue. Structural characteristics of the new matrix and the associated formative cells were not provided by the remaining 106 studies. Analysis showed that more careful preclinical evaluation with emphasis on the evidence regarding the dentinogenic specificity of pulp therapies is required. It seems that selection of appropriate vital pulp treatment strategies and pulp capping materials would be further facilitated in terms of their therapeutic validity if international consensus could be reached on a select number of mandatory criteria for tissue-specific dentinogenic events...|$|R
40|$|Since its {{establishment}} by the Treaty of Rome in 1958, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) {{has had a}} {{huge impact}} on the agricultural sector in Europe and more widely. The original CAP altered production incentives, distorting input and output markets. The CAP has undergone a number of reforms, most recently the Fischler reform in 2003 which sought to remove the link between production and farm income support payments. Chapter 1 of this thesis offers some background on the Common Agricultural Policy and outlines the thesis. The move to `decoupled 2 ̆ 7 payments, and its impact on land rental markets, is the focus of Chapters 2 and 3 of this thesis. In October 2011, the European Commission published proposals for further CAP reform (European Commission, 2011). At the heart of the proposals were reforms {{to the way in which}} Pillar I income support subsidies were distributed (both between Member States and between farmers within each Member State) and the linking of Pillar I direct income supports explicitly with environmental objectives (so-called 2 ̆ 7 greening 2 ̆ 7). Chapter 4 of this thesis explores the impact of changes in the distribution of subsidies upon the farm income inequality in the UK and Ireland. Chapter 5 discusses the findings and limitations of this research and suggests some future directions for research. I next offer abstracts of the three substantive chapters in this thesis. Abstract for Chapter 2 This chapter analyses the impact of the recent decision by the European Union to `decouple 2 ̆ 7 agricultural support payments from agricultural production on Irish farmers 2 ̆ 7 land market decisions. The land market participation decisions of Irish farmers are modelled using dynamic probit models while the extent of participation decisions are modelled using dynamic tobit models. Decoupling does not appear to have dramatically altered farmers 2 ̆ 7 land market decisions. One likely explanation for this is the cross-compliance obligation for farmers to maintain land in a state fit for agricultural production in order to receive their full payments. Abstract for Chapter 3 In this chapter the effect of decoupling on the capitalisation of agricultural subsidies into agricultural rents in Ireland is analysed using a dynamic rental equation estimated with a two step system GMM estimator that accounts for expectation error and endogenous regressors. The findings illustrate the importance of institutional details in determining the extent to which subsidies are capitalised. In the period prior to decoupling Pillar 1 subsidies were highly capitalised into Irish agricultural rents in both the short and the long run. Depending on the farm system considered between 67 and 90 cents per euro of subsidies were capitalised into agricultural rents. In the post decoupling period the rate at which Pillar 1 subsidies are capitalised into Irish agricultural rents is found to have declined. This change is likely due to the short term character of the Irish agricultural land rental market, where 11 month rental periods predominate, and the freedom that the 2003 reform of the CAP offered farmers to consolidate entitlements established on rented land. The generally very short term nature of Irish agricultural rental contracts offered farmers an opportunity to consolidate entitlements that is unlikely to have arisen in other Member States with agricultural land rental markets characterised by long term contracts. The results in both the pre and post decoupling periods highlight the high degree of inertia of agricultural rents in Ireland, and the importance of accounting for dynamics when investigating the capitalisation of agricultural subsidies into land rents. The high degree of inertia in rents means that the impact of previously capitalised agricultural policy persists through time. Abstract for Chapter 4 The agricultural sector in Europe is heavily dependent on support payments made as part of the Common Agricultural Policy. In 2011, the European Commission <b>published</b> proposals for <b>CAP</b> reform which might lead to the introduction of a basic payment scheme consisting of flat rate per hectare payments, possibly determined at a regional rather than national level. This paper explores the role that these payments may play in reducing farm income inequality in the UK and Ireland. Flat rate per farm payments are also considered to explore how a more dramatic reform would reduce inequality. Movement to flat rate per hectare payments does not uniformly decrease inequality of Farm Net Value Added (FNVA) in contrast to what one may anticipate a priori, in fact in Scotland the inequality of FNVA increases in this analysis. In contrast, flat rate per farm payments reduce inequality substantially. 2017 - 03 - 3...|$|R
