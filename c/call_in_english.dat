CoCom showed the government of Japan the contents of whistleblowing sent by Kumagai and demanded correspondence from the government of Japan {{in the end of}} December, 1985. The ministries and government offices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan), the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the Ministry of the Treasury, the National Police Agency (Japan), and the Ministry of Defense (Japan), etc. related to this affair in Japan held the meeting in January, 1986. However, moreover, they did not make it an incident. After that, the government of Japan, Itochu, Toshiba, and the associated companies refused his whistleblowing as if they became one organization till 1987. He went also to the Embassy of the United States in Tokyo, Japan and blew the whistle by the summer of 1986. The federal government of the United States did the same cross-examination about this affair to the government of Japan 40 times by 1987. But the government of Japan did not tell the federal government of the United States the truth. He was cornered mentally. Therefore, although he answered the telephone <b>call</b> <b>in</b> <b>English</b> in his house several times in December, 1986, he had refused them.|$|E
40|$|Reporting on data {{collected}} from a survey of Secondary EFL teachers in Saudi Arabia, this study is {{an analysis of the}} perceptions and attitudes held in regard to the use of computer assisted language learning (<b>CALL)</b> <b>in</b> <b>English</b> classrooms. Background data as well as attitudes were collected from 183 male and female respondents from a pool of 250 randomly selected secondary level teachers in Riyadh. The results, determined after descriptive as well as statistical analysis, indicated a positive correlation between a teacher’s attendance during training, both for computer as well as CALL, and a positive attitude toward the use of IT approaches to learning in the Saudi classroom. Recommended actions include specialized training for EFL teachers who are required to integrate CALL into regular classroom instruction. Training programs should additionally be cognizant of other needs that may emerge through applied staff feedback exercises...|$|E
40|$|Computer-assisted {{language}} learning (CALL) has {{played an important}} role in language curriculums for Chinese schools and university over two decades; however, few researchers rare focused on this applicable tool from students ’ views. Based on theories of human agency, it is essential to know people ’ attitudes and acceptance of the information technology (Rogers, 1983). Hence, this paper explores university students ’ attitudes on the widespread teaching and learning approaches utilising computer-assisted {{language learning}} in the subject university in mainland China. Data was collected by using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Current computer-related behaviours were investigated by using a questionnaire; while their attitudes towards the application of CALL in universities was further explored by adopting a semi-structured interview. On the one hand, the results of the survey present that students do not use computers to assist their English learning. However, on the other hand, the interviews indicate that students hold a positive attitude on applying <b>CALL</b> <b>in</b> <b>English</b> classes if efficient guidance is available. It suggests that more accompanied trainings and workshops would be provided in Chinese mainland universities for university students to improve their capacities of applying CALL to their English learning...|$|E

40|$|Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) has {{not been}} so {{successful}} up to date. A potential {{reason for this is}} that the gap between theoretical assumptions and reality was larger than researchers and practitioners thought. For the development of usable and realistic systems, it is crucial to be aware of practices in reality rather than theoretical and technical judgements. This paper presents a questionnaire study to help understand practices with computers in terms of learning English among Korean university students. Concerning IT usage of studying English, the results show that about a half of the participants have utilized IT, and VOD lectures are a major method at present, and vocabulary learning tools are also popular including electronic dictionaries. While learners began to use smart phone application, learning English with social network services is not common yet. Though technological aids are crucial, however, participants also pointed out that learners’ willingness or interest in learning English is the most important factor affecting English study. Emphasizing that both human/social and technological aspects should be understood simultaneously to build better systems, we hope that the results shed some light on the development of more realistic and practical <b>CALL</b> <b>in</b> <b>English</b> as a foreign language (EFL) ...|$|E
