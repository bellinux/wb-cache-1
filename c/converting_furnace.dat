40|$|The work {{performed}} {{can be divided}} into three stages. The first stage involved the development and study of a transparent heat pipe which served to illustrate the principles of heat pipes, specifically, thermosyphons or wickless heat pipes. The second stage dealt with the conception, construction and study of a laboratory scale heat pipe injection lance. The knowledge gained in the laboratory was used to build two pilot scale heat pipe injection lances, Mark I and Mark II, in the third stage of this work. These lances were tested in the copper <b>converting</b> <b>furnace</b> at the Kidd Creek smelter. Through the development of pilot scale heat pipe injection lances, it is shown that a self-cooled heat pipe lance has a furnace life orders of magnitude greater than a conventional stainless steel lance, with its exact location relative to the molten copper bath surface known...|$|E

The analysis {{was based on the}} information collected from an exhaustive literature review, the visit of 23 smelters, 14 electrorefineries and consultations at 15 different institutes specialized in the field. Data was collected for several types of matte smelting furnaces such as Outokumpu flash, INCO flash, Mitsubishi S-furnace, Teniente Converter, Noranda Process Reactor, Isasmelt and reverberatory. Behavior in Peirce-Smith converting furnaces, Mitsubishi C-furnace, Noranda Continuous Converter and Kennecott-Outokumpu Flash <b>Converting</b> <b>Furnace</b> was also discussed. The effect of various matte smelting furnace operating parameters such as matte grade, oxygen enrichment, concentration in feed, other minor constituents and temperature on minor element partition to gas and distribution coefficient (wt% matte/wt% slag) was analyzed theoretically and validated with industrial data when possible. Because fewer data were available, only a brief comparison between the elimination in traditional batch converting and new continuous converting processes was performed. The behavior of minor elements in electrorefining was described from a theoretical viewpoint. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The matte <b>converting</b> <b>furnace</b> s {{are found}} {{at the heart of}} the copper and nickel {{smelting}} processes where oxygen contained in air and industrial oxygen is used to oxidise iron in the furnace matte to produce blister copper or the iron free matte suitable for treatment in the downstream processes. A fundamental knowledge of the base metals matte smelting and converting processes system is valuable for maintaining a stable and optimum process operation. A mathematical model for the Ni - Cu - PGM matte converting process has been developed based on the assumption that the converting process is both in chemical and thermal equilibrium. The converting process demonstrated by the model is the Top Submerged Lance (TSL) base metal continuous converter that treats Ni - Cu - PGM furnace matte similar to the one utilized at one platinum smelter. The TSL PGM converter was chosen for the reasons that the Ausmelt/Isasmelt TSL smelting furnaces are high ly productive flexible smelting and converting units and environmentally friendly, that requires a low capital cost compared to other smelting processes. The model predicts the masses of the process inputs of air, oxygen, fuel coal or oil, silica flux and the outputs components contained in the three product s high grade matte, slag and offgas. The mathematical model utilises the matrix - inverse method that is used to solve the matrix representing a system of several linear equations to give the values of unknown variables. The mathematical matrix - inverse method provides us with the tool to solve many large linear equations arranged in a square matrix numerically to gives solutions. The matrix - inverse method was chosen because it is part of windows excel formulas as MINVERSE and MMULT formulas which is accessible on most computers with Microsoft windows program. The inverse of the matrices is solved using the Gauss - Jordan mathematical method. The study found that the matrix simulation model is able to give accurate predictions of the masses of the industrial TSL converter process inputs fuel, air, oxygen, and silica flux as well as the process outputs masses of the components of converter matte, slag and offgases. The model also indicated that changes in the feed matte composition, moisture in feed, matte feed rate, oxygen enrichment, bath operating temperature and fuel type results in change in one or more of the process inputs requirement and masses and composition of product phases. The simulated model results compare very well with the industrial plant process parameters sourced from one of the platinum smelters that use the TSL technology for <b>converting</b> <b>furnace</b> matte. The results predicted by the model provides good insight into the operations, control and design of the TSL Ni - Cu matte converter and therefore the model is regarded as an invaluable asset for predicting the process dynamics of the present and future converting units. The model provides a good understanding of the base matte converting process and as such will serve as a useful tool in improving and optimising the base metals converting processes without carrying out extensive and expensive tests. It is concluded from the study that the mathematical matrix - inverse calculation method is suitable for modelling the smelting and converting processes of the Ni - Cu - Fe - PGM matte in the TSL converter. The model results were validated through comparison with actual plant operating parameters sources from the relevant platinum smelter which indicated an accuracy of over 9 0 % on most parameters. The modelling of the base metal smelting and converting processes has valuably been furthered, however for complete confidence in the model results, further validation is recommended using other simulation softwares and methods...|$|E

40|$|Steel {{reheating}} is an energy-intensive process requiring uniform {{temperature distribution}} within reheating furnaces. Historically, recuperators have ben used to preheat combustion air, thereby conserving energy. More recent innovations include oxygen enrichment {{and the use}} of regenerative burners, which provide higher preheat air temperatures than recuperators. These processes have limitations such as equipment deterioration, decreasing energy efficiency over time, high maintenance costs, and increased NO{sub x} emissions with increased air preheat temperature, unless special equipment is used. Praxair, Inc., supplier of oxygen and other industrial gases to the steel industry, proposes to introduce an innovative oxy-fuel burner technology (using 100 % oxygen) to the steel reheating industry. Oxy-fuel combustion reduces or eliminates nitrogen in combustion air and substantially reduces waste heat carried out with flue gas. Based on technology currently used in the glass, hazardous waste, and aluminum industries, Praxair has developed and patented low temperature, oxy-fuel burners {{that can be used in}} high temperature industrial furnaces where temperature uniformity is critical and extremely low NO{sub x} emissions are desired. The technical goal of the project is to demonstrate the use of oxy-fuel burners in a slab reheat furnace while reducing energy consumption by 45 % and NO{sub x} emissions by 90 % within the <b>converted</b> <b>furnace</b> zones. Successful implementation of this technology also will eliminate the need to periodically replace recuperators and install NO{sub x} removal equipment...|$|R

The newest steam-powered icebreaker, Tarmo, was almost 40 years old and along with the others long overdue for replacement — even the largest Finnish icebreakers were not wide and powerful enough to assist the biggest post-war cargo ships. There was also a severe shortage of coal and occasionally the Finnish icebreakers {{had to rely on}} firewood. The steam-powered icebreakers were completely overhauled for the last time in 1951–1952 when they finally received modern navigation equipment — even as late as 1952 some had neither gyrocompass, sonar nor radar — and their crew spaces were rebuilt to modern standards. There were talks about <b>converting</b> the <b>furnaces</b> of Sampo from coal to oil, but it was not deemed necessary as the old icebreaker was due to decommissioning in the near future.|$|R

Hobart remained in Australian waters during the early 1980s, {{with the exception of}} deployments to Hawaii for RIMPAC, to the North West Indian Ocean for 6 months in 1981 and participation in Kangaroo exercises. The destroyer underwent refit in 1984. In 1985, Hobart sailed to Canada to represent Australia at a naval review recognising the 75th anniversary of the Royal Canadian Navy's founding. During 1986, the ship was deployed to South-east Asia, which was repeated in 1987. During early 1988, the destroyer participated in activities celebrating Australia's Bicentenary, then later in the year sailed to join the RIMPAC exercise.

A process has been developed to significantly upgrade the BMR leach residues through pyrometallurgical processing, which include a multistep process of roasting under oxidising atmospheres, a two-step smelting process of the roasted calcine (with engineered slag chemistry and slag-refractory interactions) and subsequent atomisation of the molten alloy which can be fed as a slurry into the HCl/Cl 2 dissolution reactors in the precious metals refinery. These pyrometallurgical steps upgrade the BMR residue from a 45 – 50 % grade up to an alloy grade of ca. 90 % PGMs, whilst removing the most deleterious elements with major process impacts on the PMR. This paper will focus primarily on the roasting step and it will investigate the thermochemical and mineralogical changes occurring during roasting. These changes were evaluated through a combination of thermochemical modelling and experimental investigation. The roasting step needs to be in an oxidative environment in order to achieve the vapourisation of Se, Te, As, Os and S. The speciation of PGMs and their vapourisation behaviour are presented, as well as the sensitivity of precious metals deportment to changes in roast conditions. [URL]...|$|R
