25|$|In 2016, it was {{estimated}} that 56 million tons of PET are produced each year. While most thermoplastics can, in principle, be recycled, PET bottle recycling is more practical than many other plastic applications because of the high value of the resin and the almost exclusive use of PET for widely used water and <b>carbonated</b> <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> bottling. PET has a resin identification code of 1. The prime uses for recycled PET are polyester fiber, strapping, and non-food containers.|$|E
25|$|Gira (kvass) is a non {{alcoholic}} beverage {{made by the}} natural fermentation of wheat, rye, or barley bread, sometimes flavoured with fruit, berries, raisins or birch sap; it is similar to Russian or Ukrainian kvass. Those brewed from rye bread and from caraway seed are popular and distributed in glass bottles. There is also a <b>carbonated</b> <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> known as gira, which is distributed in plastic bottles, but it shares neither taste nor production technology with the original beverage.|$|E

25|$|Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a <b>carbonated</b> <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> {{produced}} by The Coca-Cola Company. Originally {{intended as a}} patent medicine, it was invented in the late 19th century by John Pemberton and was bought out by businessman Asa Griggs Candler, whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century. The drink's name refers to two of its original ingredients, which were kola nuts (a source of caffeine) and coca leaves. The current formula of Coca-Cola remains a trade secret, although a variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published.|$|E
25|$|The Coca-Cola Company has {{historically}} been considered PepsiCo's primary competitor in the beverage market, and in December 2005, PepsiCo surpassed The Coca-Cola Company in market value {{for the first time}} in 112 years since both companies began to compete. In 2009, The Coca-Cola Company held a higher market share in <b>carbonated</b> <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> sales within the U.S. In the same year, PepsiCo maintained a higher share of the U.S. refreshment beverage market, however, reflecting the differences in product lines between the two companies. As a result of mergers, acquisitions, and partnerships pursued by PepsiCo in the 1990s and 2000s, its business has shifted to include a broader product base, including foods, snacks, and beverages. The majority of PepsiCo's revenues no longer come from the production and sale of carbonated soft drinks. Beverages accounted for less than 50 percent of its total revenue in 2009. In the same year, slightly more than 60 percent of PepsiCo's beverage sales came from its primary non-carbonated brands, namely Gatorade and Tropicana.|$|E
40|$|The <b>carbonated</b> <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> intake {{has changed}} the {{children}} eating habits. This factor may be directly associated with arterial hypertension due the high consumption of sodium present in foods and drinks industrialized. This study was to compare sodium levels between {{two different types of}} <b>carbonated</b> <b>soft</b> <b>drinks,</b> <b>carbonated</b> sugar drinks and diet drinks to define what type of drink has the lowest sodium content and alerting healthcare professionals about the presence of sodium in industrialized beverages. The study included labels of <b>carbonated</b> <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> n = 33 – sugar drinks (n = 21) or diet drinks (n = 12) – of five different flavors. All <b>carbonated</b> <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> evaluated have sodium in its composition. However, the sodium presence in carbonated sugar drinks was significantly lower when compared with carbonated diet drinks (69. 05 ± 16. 55 vs. 145. 30 ± 47. 36 mg Na/l, respectively). Studies to identify children's eating habits related with increased consumption of foods and drinks manufactured are needed to identify, reduce and prevent high blood pressure...|$|R

500|$|Grapico is a caffeine-free, artificially flavored <b>carbonated</b> <b>soft</b> <b>drink</b> with {{a purple}} color and a grape taste that {{is sold in}} the Southeastern United States. When {{introduced}} in 1916, the product quickly became a success, which in part was due to implying that Grapico contained real grape juice even though it contained fake juice. In the spring of 1926, J. Grossman's Sons sold the Grapico business to New Orleans business Pan American Manufacturing Co. Pan American continued J.

40|$|Consumption of sugar-sweetened {{beverages}} (SSBs) {{is considered}} to be a contributor to diabetes and the epidemic of obesity in many countries. The popularity of non-caloric <b>carbonated</b> <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> as an alternative to SSBs may be a factor in reducing the health risks associated with SSBs consumption. This study focuses on the perceptual discrimination of SSBs from artificially sweetened beverages (ASBs). 55 college students rated 14 commercially available <b>carbonated</b> <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> in terms of sweetness and likeability. They were also asked to recognize if the drinks contained sugar or a non-caloric artificial sweetener. Overall, participants showed poor accuracy in discriminating drinks’ sweeteners, with significantly lower accuracy for SSBs than ASBs. Interestingly, we found a dissociation between sweetener recognition and drink pleasantness. In fact, in spite of a chance-level discrimination accuracy of SSBs, their taste was systematically preferred to the taste of non-caloric beverages. Our findings support the idea that hedonic value of <b>carbonated</b> <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> is dissociable from its identification and that the activation of the pleasure system seems not to require explicit recognition of the sweetener contained in the <b>soft</b> <b>drink.</b> We hypothesize that preference for <b>carbonated</b> <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> containing sugar over non-caloric alternatives might be modulated by metabolic factors that are independent from conscious and rational consumers’ choices...|$|R
500|$|Scottish cuisine has {{distinctive}} {{attributes and}} recipes of its own, but shares much with wider British and European cuisine {{as a result}} of local and foreign influences, both ancient and modern. Traditional Scottish dishes exist alongside international foodstuffs brought about by migration. Scotland's natural larder of game, dairy products, fish, fruit, and vegetables is the chief factor in traditional Scots cooking, with a high reliance on simplicity and a lack of spices from abroad, as these were historically rare and expensive. Irn-Bru is the most common Scottish <b>carbonated</b> <b>soft</b> <b>drink,</b> often described as [...] "Scotland's other national drink" [...] (after whisky). During the Late Middle Ages and early modern era, French cuisine played a role in Scottish cookery due to cultural exchanges brought about by the [...] "Auld Alliance", especially during the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots. Mary, on her return to Scotland, brought an entourage of French staff who are considered responsible for revolutionising Scots cooking and for some of Scotland's unique food terminology.|$|E

40|$|Background: The regular {{ingestion}} of fluoride lowers {{the prevalence of}} dental caries. The total daily intake of fluoride for optimal dental health should be 0. 05 - 0. 07 mg fluoride/kg body weight and to avoid the risk of dental fluorosis, the daily intake should not exceed a daily level of 0. 10 mg fluoride/kg body weight. The main source of fluoride is from drinking water and other beverages. As in other countries, consumption of bottled water, juices and carbonated beverages has increased in our country. Objective: To analyze the fluoride content in bottled water, juices and <b>carbonated</b> <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> that were commonly available in Davangere city. Materials and Methods: Three samples of 10 commercially available brands of bottled drinking water, 12 fruit juices and 12 <b>carbonated</b> <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> were purchased. Bottled water and <b>carbonated</b> <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> were stored at a cold place until fluoride analysis was performed and a clear juice was prepared using different fruits without the addition of water. Then, the fluoride analysis was performed. Results: The {{mean and standard deviation}} of fluoride content of bottled water, fruit juices and <b>carbonated</b> <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> were measured, which were found to be 0. 20 mg (&# 177; 0. 19) F/L, 0. 29 mg (&# 177; 0. 06) F/L and 0. 22 mg (&# 177; 0. 05) F/L, respectively. Conclusion: In viewing {{the results of the present}} study, it can be concluded that regulation of the optimal range of fluoride in bottled drinking water, <b>carbonated</b> <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> and fruit juices should be drawn for the Indian scenario...|$|R

2500|$|Glaswegian is a dialect, {{more than}} an {{alternative}} pronunciation; words also change their meaning depending on context, e.g. [...] "away" [...] can mean [...] "leaving" [...] as in A'm away, an instruction to stop being a nuisance as in away wi ye, or [...] "drunk" [...] or [...] "demented" [...] as in he's away wi it. Ginger is a term for any <b>carbonated</b> <b>soft</b> <b>drink,</b> historically referring to ginger beer (A bottle o ginger, [...] ).

40|$|We use rich brand level retail data to {{demonstrate}} that the firm size distribution in <b>Carbonated</b> <b>Soft</b> <b>Drinks</b> is mainly an outcome {{of the degree to which}} firms own a portfolio of brands across segments of the market, and not from performance within segments.

25|$|One {{hypothesis}} {{to explain}} this relationship is that the phosphoric acid contained in some <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> (colas) displaces calcium from the bones, lowering bone density of the skeleton and leading to weakened bones, or osteoporosis. However, 2001 calcium metabolism studies by Dr. Robert Heaney suggested that {{the net effect of}} <b>carbonated</b> <b>soft</b> <b>drinks,</b> (including colas, which use phosphoric acid as the acidulant) on calcium excretion in urine was negligible. Heaney concluded that <b>carbonated</b> <b>soft</b> <b>drinks,</b> which do not contain the nutrients needed for bone health, may displace other foods which do, and that the real issue is that people who drink a lot of <b>soft</b> <b>drinks</b> also tend to have an overall diet that is low in calcium.|$|R
