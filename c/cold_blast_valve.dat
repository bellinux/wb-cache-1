50|$|A blast damper is used {{to protect}} {{occupants}} and equipment of a structure against overpressures resultant of an explosion.

50|$|A <b>blast</b> <b>valve</b> is used {{to protect}} a shelter, such as a fallout shelter or bunker, {{from the effects of}} sudden outside air {{pressure}} changes. A nuclear weapon creates a shock wave, which may produce sudden pressure changes of more than an atmosphere (about 15 pounds per square inch) even several miles or kilometers from the detonation point. After the shock wave passes, a sudden negative pressure follows.|$|R
5000|$|A typical <b>blast</b> <b>valve</b> has entries of 6-12" [...] {{diameter}} (150-300 mm), and {{a larger}} center section. Within the center section is a disk mounted on an axle, with weak springs that keep it centered, away from both entries. Pressure displaces the disk along the axle, until it plugs one entry or the other. After the blast, the springs return the disk to the center, re-opening the valve.|$|R
