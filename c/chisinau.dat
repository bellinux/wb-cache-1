5|$|Starting {{with early}} April 1944, Stavka ordered the 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts {{to mount a}} major {{offensive}} with strategic implications in western Romania. Stavkas strategic intentions were to break German and Romanian strategic defenses in northern Romania, capture the key cities of Iași and <b>Chișinău,</b> and afterwards project forces deep into Romanian territory, if possible as deep as Ploiești and Bucharest. By 5 April, Konev's front had crossed {{the upper reaches of}} Dniester and Prut Rivers, captured Khotyn and Dorohoi, and approached Târgu Frumos and Botoșani regions—– northwest of Iași—facing only light Romanian resistance. On 8 April 1944, Konev ordered the 27th and 40th Armies to conduct a coordinated offensive southward along the Târgu Frumos axis, in close cooperation with Semyon Bogdanov's 2nd Tank Army. While Konev's shock group was advancing towards Târgu Frumos, Konstantin Koroteev's 52nd Army and elements of Andrei Gravchenko's 6th Tank Army, which were operating north of Iași, were conducting operations alongside the Iași axis in order to support Konev's main effort.|$|E
