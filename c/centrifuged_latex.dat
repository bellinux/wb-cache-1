This study aimed at determining the effect of electron beam dose, beam current and centrifugation to the tensile properties of field natural rubber latex. Irradiation dose and beam current ranged from 50 to 300 kGy and 1 to 15 mA respectively. The determination of tensile properties were done on cast film prepared from irradiated field latex before and after centrifugation. It was found that tensile properties increased with radiation dose but decreased with beam current. Rubber films made from <b>centrifuged</b> irradiated field <b>latex</b> were softer and showed higher tensile strength...|$|R
40|$|A filter-fluorescent-antibody (FFA) {{staining}} {{procedure was}} developed for detection of bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The sensitivity of this procedure was determined and {{compared with that of}} the slide Gram stain of <b>centrifuged</b> samples, <b>latex</b> agglutination, and a previously developed filter Gram stain. Serial 10 -fold dilutions of filter-sterilized CSF seeded with logarithmic-phase organisms were examined by each method and cultured to determine colony-forming bacteria. The bacteria included Haemophilus influenzae type b; Neisseria meningitidis group B, C, and W 135; Streptococcus pneumoniae types 6 A and 23 F; and group B Streptococcus species. FFA was found to be equal in sensitivity to the filter Gram stain (P greater than 0. 30). Both filter-staining procedures had greater sensitivity than the slide Gram stain of centrifuged sediment (P less than 0. 02) and latex agglutination (P less than 0. 0001). Addition of human leukocytes at a concentration of 5 to 10 cells per oil immersion field did not decrease sensitivity of the FFA procedure, although background fluorescence increased. FFA is a rapid and dependable procedure for detection of low numbers of bacteria in CSF. Evaluation of FFA with clinical specimens is needed...|$|R
40|$|Batch {{emulsion}} copolymerizations of butadiene, {{methyl methacrylate}} (MMA), methacrylic acid (MAA) and hydroxyethyl methacrylate were performed in RCle reactor, {{and the product}} vulcanized to form a film typical of those used for barrier products (gloves and condoms). The water vapour transmission (WVT) or breathability and physical properties (such as tensile strength and elongation at break) of the films were measured. Factorial design was used to vary the concentration of monomers in the copolymerizations. Methacrylic acid is a hydrophilic monomer and its distribution in or on the particles {{would be expected to}} affect WVT. Characterization by ultracentrifugation, nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy showed that most of the methacrylic acid units were buried inside the particles. This appears to be responsible for a relatively low WVT rate, probably due to the absence of hydrophilic (MAA-rich) domains inside the film. When <b>centrifuged,</b> the <b>latex</b> shows two particle-containing layers; characterization of the latex revealed the presence of MMA-rich domains in one layer, probably arising from secondary particle formation late in the polymerization. The butadiene-to-MMA ratio probably dominates tensile strength through vulcanization with sulfur. The elongation at break was independent of both the butadiene-to-MMA ratio and the MAA concentration over the range studied (ascribed to competing effects), but dependent upon the total crosslinker concentration.

40|$|Ammonia {{preservation}} {{is widely}} used as the standard method of preservation for Natural Rubber (NR) latex. Because ammonia is volatile its concentration in latex is difficult to control. This study presents an alternative method of preservation of natural rubber latex using a less volatile material. Centrifuged NR latex from Kalutara district was used for this investigation and 2 -amino- 2 - methyl propanol (AMP) was added to <b>centrifuged</b> <b>latex</b> instead of ammonia. Controlled samples were prepared with ammonia as the standard preservative and in addition, ammonia and AMP mixed samples also was prepared for investigating the combined effect. Prepared latex samples were continuously monitored for characterization against the controlled samples using standard test methods like MST, VFA number, pH, Viscosity, Alkalinity, etc. Compounded latex samples were prepared once in a week from these preserved samples and dipped gloves were made to investigate the processability of these latices and determine the physical properties like tensile strength, abrasion resistance, etc. of the glove films to compare the properties with the controlled samples. Results suggest that AMP can be used effectively as a preservative for NR latex. Although 0. 2 % AMP and AMPINH 3 mixes gave satisfactory results 0. 7 % AMP preserved sample gave the best results...|$|E
40|$|The Thesis {{submitted}} to the Department of Chemical and Process Engineering for the MSc in Polymer TechnologyABSTRACT The ever innovation of rubber products in diversified fields have made it necessary to find suitable quality latex rubberfordifferentproducts. Because,manufacturesofrubberproductsareinsistingoncertain range of mechanical stability (usually {{in the range of}} 500 - 1000 seconds), there is a continuous research going on to find suitable test method to asses a such quality of latex It is been found that volatile fatty acid number (VFA No:), Alkalinity and Mechanical Stability Time (MST) test for quality control test proved to be a sui tabl e methods for making quality products. The objective of this research to simply give a alternative mclhod to develop mechanical stability without adding soap because previous studies shows that when soap level is high the quality of the latex was low. Current studies consist of analyzing the MST variation of <b>centrifuged</b> <b>latex</b> with aeration level and maturation. And also analyze the variation of other properties such as Alkalinity, VF A No:, Viscosity, to nductivity and pH. The latex used for this study were obtained from a centrifuged plant, accordingly a special request was made to them to supply latex with minimum addition of soap. Aeration was supplied in different levels to different sample. Following properties was investigated at intervals: MST, Alkalinity, VFA No:, Viscosity, pH and Conductivity Out of the whole investigated properties; response to the aeration level was remarkable in MST, with maturation results suggest that MST is increases with higher the aeration level. Other properties such as a VF A, Alkalinity are not much effect with the air quantity. Therefore supply of air is not destroying the quality of the latex. VF A increment is not much significant. Viscosity is decreases up to some significant level with air quality. pH of the samples show some storage patterns not a trend pattern. Variation in MST is due to the air supplied to the sample; promote hydrolysis of proteins and phospholipids in the latex. Finally former fatty acids anions, phosphate anions are observed at the [...] . particle interface and enhance the stability of latex Further more results show that the highest aeration level is not the optimum aeration level. so • further studies should be carried out to find an optimum aeration level and how minimize the space of vessel which is required for aeration...|$|E
40|$|Raw rubber {{processing}} factories generate {{large amounts of}} wastewater containing organic pollutants & various process chemicals. Factory effluents exhibit high BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) & COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) concentrations, ammonia & suspended solids that are amenable to biological treatment methods. Rubber Research Institute (RRI) of Sri Lanka developed a novel & cost effective biological effluent treatment technique for rubber-processing effluents discharged by crepe rubber & <b>centrifuged</b> <b>latex</b> factories. Treatment system, based on high rate anaerobic digestion coupled with aerobic stabilization also consists of settling & sand filtration. The main feature of this technique {{is the use of}} a low cost, septic tank type anaerobic digester filled up with coir fibres for the attachment of useful microorganisms for effective biological conversion. Biological kinetic expressions have been derived for the design & control of effluent treatment plants where aerobic digestion is used commonly as the only treatment method. The kinetic coefficients in these expressions are widely used in design calculations. For a specified waste, a given biological community & a particular set of operating conditions the kinetic coefficients are fixed, Kinetic coefficients used for the design of domestic effluent treatment plants cannot be applied for the design of industrial effluent treatment plants as the waste composition & biological communities involved are different. Also kinetic coefficients for the anaerobically pretreated wastewater could be very different to those of the raw wastewater even for the same type of waste. No kinetic study has been carried out yet for the RRI developed treatment process for making possible improvements & modifications for optimal operation & performance of the aerobic treatment system to reduce, capital, operational & maintenance costs under low loading conditions. The objective {{of this study is to}} find out the kinetic coefficients required for the design of activated sludge process from anaerobically pretreated rubber industry wastewater. The obtained values of kinetic coefficients were used to model an existing treatment system. A pilot-scale continuously aerated stirred tank was used as a model reactor. Reactor was operated without a recycle stream & fed with a steady flow of anaerobically pretreated wastewater obtained from a full-scale rubber industry effluent treatment plant. Samples were taken for five different runs at five different mean-cell residence times (). BOD & MLVSS (Mixed Liquor Volatile Suspended Solids) of each sample for each run were measured according to Standard Methods for the Examination of Water & Wastewater. The following kinetic coefficients were estimated by a graphical method using measured data & the standard kinetic expressions. • Y = cell yield coefficient • kd= cell decay coefficient • Ks = half-velocity constant • k = maximum substrate concentration per unit mass of microorganisms • μm = maximum specific growth rate). The obtained kinetic. coefficients show significant differences to those of domestic wastewater reported in literature. Maximum substrate concentration per unit mass of microorganisms (k) is less than one-half of the corresponding value for domestic wastewater. This implies more than double the concentration of microorganisms is required to be maintained in the aeration tank than that for domestic wastewater. Half-velocity constant (Ks) is more than double the concentration of the corresponding value for domestic wastewater. It implies that the microorganisms have high affinity to anaerobically digested substrate. This could be expected because most anaerobically digested intermediate products & end products are considered good substrates for heterotrophic organisms. The cell yield coefficient (Y) is comparatively higher & the cell decay coefficient (kd) relatively lower than those for domestic wastewater leading to a higher μm. maximum specific growth rate. Therefore a richer microorganism concentration could be expected in the aeration tank. Obtained kinetic coefficients were used to model an existing activated sludge treatment system. The minimum mean-cell residence time calculated with the obtained kinetic coefficients lead to a value of O. 9 (d) with a safety factor of 3. 33 & is within the accepted range for plant operation (2 - 20). Sludge washouts are very unlikely due to the fulfillment of the condition > 1 / μm indicating a good waste stabilization. Calculations revealed significant difference between the predicted & operated condition of the plant. The obtained kinetic coefficients were used to optimize the plant operation by estimating sludge recirculation rate, aeration rate & sludge production rate. The findings will help improve the treatment system design & reduce the associated costs...|$|E

This study is based on a series of Lowry method of protein analysis. The field latex was concentrated by centrifugation method. A laboratory scale <b>latex</b> <b>centrifuge</b> machine (model SPL- 100, Satio Separator Ltd, Japan) with a capacity of 5 liters was used for concentrating the latex. The process increased the solid content in rubber latex from 29 % to approximately 60 %, and also reduced the percentage of non-rubber content. The experimental results of UV spectrophotometer (UV- 2401 PC, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) showed that rubber films of higher TSC percentage got significant amount of water leachable protein. Furthermore, they showed different protein content for different dipping time in water. Another experiment was carried out for irradiated latex of different doses. The change of protein content was significant. Index Term [...] immunoglobuline, irradiated latex, tetramethylthiuram. I...|$|R
