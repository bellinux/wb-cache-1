The {{east side of}} the Sierra Nevada/Cascade Crest in northeastern California is most severely affected, with about 20 percent of the land out of production because of annosus root disease. In Yosemite Valley, 158 annosus root disease centers were identified. These centers are enlarging at an average rate of 0. 67 m/yr. The most important impact of annosus root disease in recreation areas appears to be hazard and the loss of vegetative cover. Annosus root disease, which is caused by Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.) Brev., is locally a very serious problem in California forests. Its effects are particularly noticeable in pine, and the primary impact of the disease is tree mortality. Forest managers and forest pest specialists are continually aware of its presence in the forest. Evidence for this is the number of biological evaluations requested by forest managers and performed by forest pest specialists in Region Five of the National Forest System. Of 152 biological evaluations conducted during the years 1984 through 1988 at the request of forest managers, 32 percent identified H. annosum as a primary or secondary cause of tree mortality.

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Oregon's {{forestry}} {{industry has}} {{and will continue}} to be a vital component of Oregon's economy, with twenty-two percent of Oregon's 1986 gross state product and thirty-nine percent of Oregon's 1986 gross manufacturing product related the forestry goods. An integral component to proper management of Oregon's forestry lands is Sustaining the timber yield from the <b>commercial</b> <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> base. The Oregon Forest Practice Rules and Statue (1985) mandates that commercial forest lands &e subject to reforestation requirements. Forest lands which do not meet these requirements are candidate for deletion from the <b>commercial</b> <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> base. Reforestation of steep skeletal slopes has proven difficult; high seedling mortality has occurred due, in part, to dry raveling of the surface soil. Dry raveling is a form of slope failure on steep slopes generally characterized by surface movement of individual particles, and/or a shallow veneer of material. The extent of seedling mortality due to dry raveling s believed to be substantial in mountainous forest lands in Southwest Oregon. The present study represents a research effort to define the raveling process and the potential for seedling mortality due to dry raveling. Laboratory testing of the raveling process was conducted using a tilting bed constructed to infinite slope criteria. Sixty-one raveling tests were performed on material taken from ravel-prone sites in Southwest Oregon. Tests involved variations in water content, gain size distribution, and profile thickness. Raveling angles, profile mantle failure angles, and the angle of repose were examined, along with the kinematics of the granular flow during mantle failure. The raveling events were found to progress from individual particle movement, to particle assemblage movement, to mantle failure. A dry ravel model was proposed based on the analysis of the literature and test results. The ravel model reflected the dependence to the raveling system on the free surface boundary and momentum transfer to the surface material by the raveling particles. The angle of repose was identified as a fundamental soil property which can be related to a dry raveling potential and therefore used by forest management personal as a slope limit above which progressively greater dry ravel-induced seedling mortality will occur...|$|E

This has come {{at a time when}} old-growth forests are rapidly being eliminated in order to meet human demands for wood products. In Oregon, for example, it is anticipated that virtually all remaining old-growth <b>forests</b> on <b>commercial</b> <b>forest</b> <b>lands</b> will be harvested by the year 2020 (Beuter et al. 1976). Thereafter, regenerating forests on cutover areas will be intensively managed and harvested every 60 - 80 years on most sites. If history is a good example, it is extremely unlikely that old-growth forests will ever again be regenerated on these cutover areas. Because of the overwhelming economic pressures mandating the harvest of the remaining stands of old-growth, we believe that the single most difficult issue facing wildlife biologists and land managers in the Pacific Northwest is how to retain viable populations of wildlife that find their optimum habitat in old-growth forests. One species associated with old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest is the spotted owl (Strix occidentalis). During the last 10 years we have been closely involved with studies and management of this species in Oregon.

40|$|Abstract The {{majority}} of forest {{land in the}} U. S. is owned by individuals and institutions that are not {{directly involved in the}} forest products industry. Much of this land is thought to be managed inefficiently, but the reasons for this are unclear. This article focusses on three possible factors: information and transactions costs; nonfinancial forest values; and liquidity constraints. Models for the reforestation and harvesting decisions are presented that incorporate these factors. These models use the Faustmann model to define the financial value of forest land, and borrow from previously developed models of nonindustrial private forest management to incorporate the other factors into the forest management decision. A wealth of data exists on nonindustrial private forest management, and discussion focusses in particular on models that are suitable for the study of existing data. The vast {{majority of}} <b>commercial</b> <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> in the United States is privately owned. 1 This land is commonly considered as falling into two separate classes, defined by a particular characteristic of the landowner: whether the owner is involved in the forest products industry (industrial, private forest land), or not (nonindustrial private forest land). 2 Landowners in the former class can be taken as principally profit-oriented, and s...|$|E

A Static Economic Model established {{the nature of}} the Lake States spruce-fir market and a Comparative Static Model examined changes brought about by spruce budworm outbreaks. Outbreaks result in short-run supply shifts which probably decrease total revenue to stumpage owners but do not affect demand. The magnitude of long-run impacts were dependent on developing Lake States markets and forest management techniques. Further research is necessary on the value of short-run losses to stumpage owners so that the costs of forest management can be compared with outbreak losses. Long-run shifts in demand can be facilitated by attracting new industry to the area, developing new markets for the spruce-fir resource, and demonstrating that the spruce-fir resource can provide a continuous fiber source in the future. These shifts would provide the price incentives that land managers require to undertake intensive forest management. Research on the development of new markets for the spruce-fir resource is needed. As markets develop, the long-run impacts become less severe. Technology transfer programs already exist to aid land managers in developing management strategies to increase yields of spruce-fir and minimize outbreak impact...|$|E

Therefore, interest has been renewed into studies examining forest productivity and minesoil development on areas planted in trees. Since fresh geologic materials in minesoils undergo rapid pedogenic changes, long-term studies may provide valuable insight into tree growth, plant successional changes, and soil development over time. In summer of 2000, soil development and forest productivity were evaluated on a 30 -year-old (pre-SMCRA) surface mine in northern West Virginia that had been planted with white pine (Pinus strobus L.). The site offered a unique research opportunity in that one-half of the site was planted to white pine, while the other half was left to natural revegetation. Canopy tree species composition, density, basal area, and height, along with species composition and density of woody understory seedlings, were evaluated in the pine plantation and on the naturally revegetated site. On each site, three soil pits were dug, the minesoils were classified, and soil samples were taken from each described horizon to determine physical and chemical properties. Forest productivity, including productivity of volunteer hardwoods, was much greater on the pine planted site than on the naturally revegetated site.

40|$|The forest {{industry}} will increasingly rely on fast-growing intensively managed southern pine plantations to furnish wood and fiber. Intensive silvicultural practices, including competition control, stand density control, fertilization, and genetic improvement are yielding tremendous {{gains in the}} quantity of wood production from <b>commercial</b> <b>forest</b> <b>land.</b> How these technologies affect wood properties was heretofore unknown, although there is concern about the suitability of fast-grown wood for traditional forest products. A four year study was undertaken {{to examine the effects}} of these intensive practices on the properties of loblolly and slash pine wood by applying a common sampling method over 10 existing field experiments. Early weed control gets young pines off to a rapid start, often with dramatically increased growth rates. This response is all in juvenile wood however, which is low in density and strength. Similar results are found with early Nitrogen fertilization at the time of planting. These treatments increase the proportion of juvenile wood in the tree. Later, mid-rotation fertilization with Nitrogen and Phosphorus can have long term (4 - 8 year) growth gains. Slight reductions in wood density are short-lived (1 - 2 years) and occur while the tree is producing dense, stiff mature wood. Impacts of mid-rotation fertilization on wood properties for manufacturing are estimated to be minimal. Genetic differences are evident in wood density and other properties. Single family plantings showed somewhat more uniform properties than bulk improved or unimproved seedlots. Selection of genetic sources with optimal wood properties may counter some of the negative impacts of intensive weed control and fertilization.

Treatments applied were: Manual slashing; Manual slashing plus Simazine; Dead shade providsd by spraying the brush with herbicides and leaving it standing dead; and Control (no treatment). The location factor provided differences in season of moisture availability and temperature extremes in which maximum growing-season water and heat stress {{were observed in}} Oregon. Clearing led to different shifts in competitor types to herbs in Oregon and to resprouting shrubs in Mexico. The differences among treatments showed a similarity in tendencies in both locations; aspect affected the degree of differences. Eliminating {{all or part of}} the competing vegetation conserved soil moisture effectively increased the radiation load on the ground. reduced the transpirational loss of soil moisture and increased the evaporation demand of the air. The lack of treatment kept the radiation load to minimum reducing the potential evaporation and temperatures but the live cover strongly reduced the soil moisture availability and reduced photosynthetically active light. Lethality was greatest where aspect and location effects also led to minimum soil moisture. Clearing in general increased tree growth and increased growth most with further reductions in root competition. On south slopes the treatments in the cleared area increased the likelihood of heat damage during the dry season for seedlings located on rocky spots. Dead shade ameliorated the temperature-related stress and competition reduction ameliorated the soil-water related stress. Differences among species reflect differences in strategies adapted to native environments. Ecological and physiological parameters indicate that complete vegetation control in Oregon and complete woody plant control in Nexico are essential to successful introduction of pine species into brush-covered <b>commercial</b> <b>forest</b> <b>land...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{past two}} decades have seen sales of {{millions}} of acres of <b>commercial</b> <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> in the United States. Changed ownership often results in altered forest management, parcelization or development. Such changes have profound implications for forest species and ecosystems, as well as the timber industry, recreational opportunities, and local and regional economies. An emerging strategy seeks to protect lands through complex public-private partnerships involving state agencies, conservation organizations, and commercial investors. By definition, these partnerships have both environmental and socioeconomic goals; as such, they represent contemporary experiments in sustainable development applied to forested landscapes. As this approach is a recent innovation, its benefits for nature and people have yet to be demonstrated, and the general applicability of this integrated approach to conservation is unknown. Our objective is to identify context-specific objectives and indicators to support integrated monitoring and adaptive management for the former Finch Pruyn lands, which encompass 161, 000 acres in the Adirondack region of New York State. This interdisciplinary project involves social science faculty and students from Cornell University and cooperation from conservation scientists from The Nature Conservancy. Through {{a review of the literature}} on criteria and indicators for sustainable forestry, we developed an analytical framework for measuring ecological, social, and economic implications of forest management practices. Through key informant interviews, we identified context-specific objectives and indicators for the Finch Pruyn lands, including forest health, species protection, expanded recreation opportunities and community economic vitality. Our approach allows us to compare existing commitments to collection of monitoring data to ideal data sets as defined by actors occupying various structural positions. Identification of potential gaps in monitoring represents an opportunity for dialogue, reallocation of resources and enrollment of new strategic partners. Over time, these global and local indicators can support an adaptive framework through which flows of information inform management in an iterative process. Preliminary results indicate that this project entails several innovations that may contribute to its success, including the development of a comprehensive ecological baseline and the explicit engagement of local claims to livelihoods and access. We make several recommendations for future working forest agreements, such as the need to define clear environmental and socioeconomic goals at the outset, and, when private philanthropy is central to project viability, the incorporation of monitoring costs into initial fundraising targets. We believe these lessons are applicable to conservation development projects in the Northern Forest region and beyond...|$|E
50|$|The Blazo-Leavitt house faces south, and {{its western}} side faces Green Mountain, an {{isolated}} mountain in Effingham, New Hampshire {{and part of}} the foothills of the White Mountains. Nearby is the Leavitt Plantation Forest (connected with another branch of the Leavitt family), an 8603 acre tract that is the largest contiguous block of <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> south of Sebago Lake. Leavitt Plantation Forest covers 20 percent of Parsonsfield's land. With the support of The Nature Conservancy, the State of Maine has purchased a permanent conservation easement to ensure sustainable forest practices and public pedestrian access for recreation.

40|$|Abstract During April 2007, <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> {{per capita}} in the United States dropped below 1 ha.

The US now joins the ranks of most countries (77 %) having <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> per capita below 1 ha. The combination of an increasing human population with stable or increasing per capita natural resource utilization may place even more demand on resources derived from <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> in the future.
