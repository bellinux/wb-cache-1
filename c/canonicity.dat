5|$|However, as {{with all}} Doctor Who and Torchwood {{spin-off}} media, the <b>canonicity</b> {{in relation to the}} television series is unclear.|$|E
25|$|The {{book was}} not among those whose <b>canonicity</b> was in doubt, {{according}} to Eusebius; however, it {{is not included in}} an ancient Syrian canon. Theodore of Mopsuestia also presented a negative opinion toward its <b>canonicity.</b> Outside of the Syrian world, however, the book has many early witnesses, and appears to have been widely accepted.|$|E
25|$|Jamie's {{ultimate}} fate {{remains unclear}} within the generally accepted <b>canonicity</b> {{of the various}} Doctor Who spin-off media.|$|E
25|$|The <b>canonicity</b> {{of extra}} {{features}} found on home DVD releases, such as deleted scenes, {{has never been}} explicitly addressed.|$|E
25|$|The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints holds to the <b>canonicity</b> of the Book of Abraham.|$|E
25|$|Note: The {{following}} list {{does not}} necessarily reflect the historical <b>canonicity</b> or typical order of New Testament books in the Peshitta translation.|$|E
25|$|The {{makers of}} Doctor Who have {{generally}} avoided making pronouncements about <b>canonicity,</b> with Russell T Davies {{explaining that he}} does not think about the concept for the Doctor Who TV series or its spin-offs.|$|E
25|$|The Master has {{featured}} in spin-offs of the series, which are of unclear <b>canonicity</b> {{and may not}} {{take place in the}} same continuity. The Master in these stories is, nevertheless, recognisably the same character.|$|E
25|$|A race of shapeshifters {{known as}} the Ganazalum {{impersonate}} various companions, dead and living, in the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip Planet of the Dead (DWM #141-#142), Kingdom among them. Generally, the <b>canonicity</b> of the various Doctor Who spin-off media is open to interpretation.|$|E
25|$|An {{article by}} Russell T Davies in the Doctor Who Annual 2006 states that Romana was President of the Time Lords during the Last Great Time War against the Daleks (see below), which ended with Gallifrey being destroyed. As with all {{spin-off}} media, its <b>canonicity</b> {{in relation to}} the television series is debatable.|$|E
25|$|In the 3rd century, Bishop Dionysius of Alexandria {{rejected}} apostolic authorship, but {{accepted the}} book's <b>canonicity.</b> Dionysius believed that author was another man also named John, John the Presbyter, teacher of Papias, bishop of Hieropolis. Eusebius of Caesarea later agreed with this. Because authorship {{was one of}} several considerations for canonization, several Church Fathers and the Council of Laodicea rejected Revelation.|$|E
25|$|What {{was perhaps}} most {{significant}} for the LXX, as distinct from other Greek versions, was that the LXX began to lose Jewish sanction after differences between it and contemporary Hebrew scriptures were discovered (see Disputes over <b>canonicity).</b> Even Greek-speaking Jews tended less to the LXX, preferring other Jewish versions in Greek, {{such as that of}} the 2nd-century Aquila translation, which seemed to be more concordant with contemporary Hebrew texts.|$|E
25|$|Buddhist schools vary on {{the exact}} nature of the path to liberation, the {{importance}} and <b>canonicity</b> of various teachings and scriptures, and especially their respective practices. Practices of Buddhism include taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha, study of scriptures, observance of moral precepts, renunciation of craving and attachment, the practice of meditation (including calm and insight), the cultivation of wisdom, loving-kindness and compassion, the Mahayana practice of bodhicitta and the Vajrayana practices of generation stage and completion stage.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{concept to}} spoken and written Klingon is <b>canonicity.</b> Only words and grammatical forms introduced by Marc Okrand are considered canonical Klingon by the KLI and most Klingonists. However, as {{the growing number}} of speakers employ different strategies to express themselves, it is often unclear as to what level of neologism is permissible. New vocabulary has been collected in a list maintained by the KLI until 2005 and has since then been followed up by Klingon expert Lieven Litaer.|$|E
25|$|War of the Daleks, {{like the}} comic strips and audio plays, is of {{uncertain}} <b>canonicity</b> {{when it comes}} to the television series. At the conclusion of War, Davros was seemingly disintegrated by a Spider Dalek on the order of the Dalek Prime. However, Davros had previously recruited one of the Spider Daleks as a sleeper agent for just such an eventuality, and even he was not certain in the end if he was being disintegrated or being teleported away to safety, leaving the possibility open for his return.|$|E
25|$|The <b>canonicity</b> {{of these}} Greek {{additions}} {{has been a}} subject of scholarly disagreement practically since their first appearance in the Septuagint— Martin Luther, being perhaps the most vocal Reformation-era critic of the work, considered even the original Hebrew version to be of very doubtful value. Luther's complaints against the book carried {{past the point of}} scholarly critique and may reflect Luther's antisemitism, which is disputed, such as in the biography of Luther by Derek Wilson, which points out that Luther's anger at the Jews was not at their race but at their theology.|$|E
25|$|Birthright was {{initially}} intended {{to establish a}} new origin for Superman and Luthor. To Waid's disappointment, however, the <b>canonicity</b> of the series was eventually discredited by stories that followed it. A concise biography for Luthor, later outlined in Action Comics #850, first appeared in the 2007 limited series Countdown to Final Crisis #34. Luthor's current origin appears to be a synthesis of aspects from the Silver Age continuity and The Man of Steel mini-series. Recent changes to DC Comics continuity were revealed to have been a result of the 2005 Infinite Crisis mini-series.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{creation}} of the Doctor Who character by BBC Television in the early 1960s, a myriad of stories have been published about Doctor Who, in different media: apart from the actual television episodes that continue to be produced by the BBC, there have also been novels, comics, short stories, audio books, radio plays, interactive video games, game books, webcasts, DVD extras, and even stage performances. In this respect it is noteworthy that the BBC takes no position on the <b>canonicity</b> of any of such stories, and producers of the show have expressed distaste for the idea.|$|E
25|$|Dodo's {{life after}} she left the Doctor was not {{dealt with in the}} programme. The {{spin-off}} novel Who Killed Kennedy by David Bishop reveals that Dodo suffered a nervous breakdown and was unable to remember her adventures with the Doctor, drifting in and out of psychiatric institutions. Becoming involved with a journalist who was investigating the truth behind UNIT, Dodo is murdered by a pawn of the Master. Her funeral is attended only by her lover and an unidentified man who, based on the limited description provided, may be either the Second or Seventh Doctor. The <b>canonicity</b> of the novels in relation to the television series is open to question.|$|E
25|$|The album {{begins with}} {{photographs}} and memorabilia from {{the ancestors of}} the two families, and then progresses with baby photos of Homer and Marge, and then profiles them as they grow up and fall in love. Finally it shows photographs and memorabilia from Bart's, Lisa's and Maggie's childhoods. The Simpson tree {{can be found on}} the inside of the front cover, while the Bouvier family appears on the inside of the back cover. It is revealed by the family trees, for example, that Homer is descended from Scandinavians and American Indians, and Marge is descended from the French. The information in the book has contradicted several times on The Simpsons and its <b>canonicity</b> is unknown.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of inconsistency covers {{not only the}} text but even the composition of scripture. Since the Bible never enumerates its own component parts, those who believe it is inerrant must appeal to extra-biblical authority to justify which books to include. Over the centuries, different communities have accepted shifting collections of books. The size of these biblical canons varies enormously, from the Samaritans, who consider the five books of the Torah alone to be authoritative, to the Ethiopian Bible, which contains all the books of all other churches plus such titles as the Book of Josephus and the Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians. The contents of canons have varied over time, books regarded as authoritative by some Christians at some points in history being excluded from the collections of later communities—this was {{the fate of the}} many apocryphal Gospels from the first few centuries of the Church (the Gospel of Thomas is a famous example); books long regarded as canonical in one branch of Christianity may be dropped by others on doctrinal grounds (the fate of the Deuterocanonical books, canonical in the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Church but repudiated by the Protestants because they are not included in the Hebrew Bible and supported doctrines to which the Protestant reformers objected such as the intercession of saints, purgatory, prayers for the dead etc.; and some books that could have been included, such as the Book of Enoch, quoted as scriptural in , were excluded from the canons of almost all later communities (see <b>Canonicity</b> of the Book of Enoch).|$|E
500|$|The site's {{popularity}} grew {{even further}} once Whedon himself started posting. Whedon first acknowledged reading Whedonesque in late 2004, and the account 'joss' {{was created for}} his use on August 15, 2004. [...] Whedon's first post directly to the site was on April 27, 2005, announcing preview screenings of Serenity. He later extended his involvement, using the site {{as a means of}} communication with fans on topics including his own fandom of Veronica Mars, the <b>canonicity</b> of Buffy Season 8 comic books, and status updates on his projects. Through the use of tagging, Whedonesque maintains a list of threads Whedon has started or in which he has posted. In 2006, [...] comic book author Brian Lynch began posting to Whedonesque as well.|$|E
500|$|It {{is unknown}} in the {{official}} timeline whether or not Sonic returns any romantic feelings to Amy. In text, SEGA has alternated between stating that he sees her as somewhat of an annoyance, and declaring that he does indeed like her but is simply too shy to admit it. The few times that he has shown interest in her, it {{has been at the}} discretion of the player, such as in Sonic the Hedgehog (2006) where the player has the option of choosing her or Princess Elise in the Test of Love (although the events of this game technically did not take place), and in Sonic Unleashed, where the player can either accept or decline her proposal to go on a date. Furthermore, although the <b>canonicity</b> of the game is debated, [...] features an option to romance Amy through dialogue, and eventually confess feelings for her.|$|E
500|$|Silent Hill 2 {{features}} six endings, all {{presented as}} equally possible; Konami has kept their <b>canonicity</b> ambiguous. In [...] "Leave", James has one last meeting with Mary, reads her letter, {{and leaves the}} town with Laura. [...] "In Water" [...] sees James commit suicide by driving his car off a cliff. The [...] "Maria" [...] ending sees Mary as {{the woman on the}} rooftop, who has not forgiven James for killing her. After her defeat, James dismisses her as a hallucination and then leaves the town with an alive Maria, who briefly coughs, suggesting she will become sick just as Mary did, and the cycle will repeat. The other three endings are only available in replay games, including [...] "Rebirth", in which James plans to resurrect Mary using arcane objects collected throughout the game, and two joke endings: [...] "Dog", where James discovers that a dog has apparently been controlling all the events of the game, and [...] "UFO", where James is abducted by extraterrestrials {{with the help of the}} first game's protagonist, Harry Mason.|$|E
500|$|Doctor Who had {{previously}} aired two related specials for Comic Relief. The {{first was the}} 1999 spoof The Curse of Fatal Death, which was also written by Steven Moffat. The spin-off series The Sarah Jane Adventures produced its own mini-episode [...] "From Raxacoricofallapatorius with Love" [...] for the 2009 Comic Relief appeal. Unlike The Curse of Fatal Death, [...] "Space" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] {{are considered to be}} canonical. The <b>canonicity</b> of the two mini-episodes was affirmed by Moffat in Doctor Who Magazine. Moffat stated that, unlike Curse of the Fatal Death, [...] "Space" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] is not a spoof or a sketch, but rather [...] "a little miniature story" [...] {{in the style of the}} Children in Need mini-episodes. He described it as [...] "A moment of life aboard the TARDIS. But obviously life about the TARDIS instantly gets you into terrible jeopardy, and all of causality is threatened. As I'm sure it is every day when they get up and have their coffee..." [...] The concept of a TARDIS inside the TARDIS had been previously explored in The Time Monster (1972) and Logopolis (1980), though both times it was the TARDIS of the Master. Amy also repeats one of her lines from [...] "The Big Bang" [...] at the end of [...] "Space".|$|E
2500|$|Harris {{published}} {{several books}} including Introductory Hebrew Grammar, Inspiration and <b>Canonicity</b> of the Bible, Your Bible, and Man—God's Eternal Creation ...|$|E
2500|$|The Daleks have {{appeared}} in many Doctor Who spin-offs, sometimes opposing the Doctor and sometimes on their own. [...] All these spin-offs are of uncertain <b>canonicity,</b> {{and not all of}} them can be easily reconciled with the television series or with each other. Where they fit in the Dalek timeline is also uncertain.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>canonicity</b> of Sarah Jane's {{appearances}} in the audio dramas is, like all Doctor Who spin-off media, unclear, {{and they may not}} even take place in the same continuity as one another. For example, the novels' mention of Sarah Jane as having been married is contradicted by the later Sarah Jane Smith audio play Dreamland, and the Sarah Jane Adventures episode [...] "Invasion of the Bane".|$|E
2500|$|The {{recent history}} of Gallifrey has been {{referred}} to in the spin-off media as well as the television series. In addition to the uncertain <b>canonicity</b> of the spin-offs, where these various events fit on a time line, or even if they can be consolidated into a single one, is also unclear. The spin-off media [...] have also suggested [...] that they [...] each take place in separate continuities.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2002 Big Finish audio drama, , Sarah Jane (voiced by Sladen), {{states that}} Lavinia has {{recently}} died and Brendan {{is living in}} San Francisco, and mentions Juno Baker. The <b>canonicity</b> {{of the story is}} uncertain. Lavinia's death is implied periodically in The Sarah Jane Adventures: Sarah Jane laments in 2007's [...] "Invasion of the Bane" [...] that she is [...] "all alone". Clyde refers to [...] "the money her aunt left her" [...] in 2009's [...] "The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith"; neither Lavinia's nor Brendan's absence from Sarah Jane's aborted wedding is addressed.|$|E
2500|$|All that {{is known}} about the Glasgow {{division}} of the Torchwood Institute is that it is run by a [...] "very strange man". In the novel The Twilight Streets (set in February 2008), Jack contacts the [...] "very strange man" [...] whose name is revealed as Archie, and Torchwood Two's headquarters are near the River Clyde. As with all spin-off media, the <b>canonicity</b> of this remains unclear. An e-mail shown in part one of [...] (set in September 2009) suggests that Torchwood Two disbanded some time before the events of the 456, and that Torchwood Three is the only branch remaining.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{periodical}} for Retro Gamer magazine, Szczepaniak {{identified the}} natural {{comparison of the}} games by reviewers {{to the quality of}} games {{in the rest of the}} Zelda series as an improper comparison to make, and suggested that when reviewed in their own right, the games were actually excellent. Contrary to what were described as [...] "lies perpetuated about ," [...] Retro Gamer described the games as [...] "astoundingly good" [...] and rated them together as number ten in its [...] "Perfect Ten Games" [...] for CD-i. While acknowledging that they lacked <b>canonicity,</b> they were praised for exhilarating pacing and superb gameplay design.|$|E
2500|$|Paul claims {{several times}} that believers are saved by Divine grace, and that believers are {{therefore}} [...] "not under law, but under grace". The Epistle of James, in contrast, claims that Christians are to obey the [...] "whole law", that [...] "a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone", and that [...] "faith without works is dead". Protestants, with their belief in salvation by faith alone, have had difficulty reconciling these contradictory views. Martin Luther, for example, asserted that the Epistle of James might be a forgery, and relegated it to an appendix in his Bible (although he later accepted its <b>canonicity</b> - see Antilegomena).|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} comic book appearances, Martha has {{appeared}} in the Doctor Who Magazine strips from #381 onwards and the Doctor Who Adventures comics from #28 onwards. The character also appears in the Battles in Time series of comic books periodically. In 2007, American comic book publisher IDW Publishing (publisher of various Angel, Star Trek and The Transformers comic titles) announced their plans to do a devoted series of Tenth Doctor and Martha comics for an American audience. When asked about <b>canonicity,</b> IDW executive editor Chris Ryall dodged the issue by saying all the comics are [...] "blessed" [...] by Russell T Davies but {{it is up to the}} individual how canonical each story is.|$|E
2500|$|The Star Wars canon {{originally}} {{existed on}} several levels. [...] The highest level {{was the original}} Star Wars films, and statements by George Lucas; tie-in fiction from the Star Wars expanded universe had a different level of <b>canonicity.</b> [...] The complex system was maintained by Leland Chee, a Lucasfilm employee. [...] After Disney bought the franchise, all material published prior to April 25, 2014 that was not any of the Star Wars movies or the CGI cartoon The Clone Wars was declared in the [...] "Legends" [...] continuity, marking them as no longer official canon. [...] All subsequent material exists {{on the same level}} of canon, with the Lucasfilm Story Group being established to ensure no contradictions among canon works.|$|E
2500|$|When {{there are}} {{multiple}} [...] "official" [...] works or original media, {{the question of what}} is and what is not canonical can be unclear. This is resolved either by explicitly excluding certain media from the status of canon (as in the case of Star Trek and Star Wars), by assigning different levels of <b>canonicity</b> to different media (as was in the case of Star Wars before the franchise was purchased by Disney), by considering different but licensed media treatments official and equally canonical to the series timeline within their own continuities universe, but not across them, or not resolved at all. The use of canon is of particular importance with regard to reboots or re-imaginings of established franchises, such as the 2009 Star Trek film, because {{of the ways in which}} it influences the viewer experience.|$|E
