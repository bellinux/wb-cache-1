5|$|Arsenal {{travelled}} to Goodison Park in {{the fourth}} round of the competition to play Everton. They won the match 1–0 courtesy of a late Emmanuel Adebayor goal, which came from a <b>corner.</b> <b>For</b> much of the game Everton played with a man disadvantage as striker James McFadden was sent off in the 19th minute for dissent.|$|E
5|$|At Extreme Rules, Edge {{helped his}} friend Christian {{to win the}} vacant World Heavyweight Championship. At SummerSlam, Edge was in Christian's <b>corner</b> <b>for</b> his World Heavyweight Championship defense against Randy Orton but, {{disappointed}} by the cowardly tactics Christian used to win his second World Heavyweight Championship, berated him and walked out on him. Christian then lost the title to Orton for a second time. On the September 16, 2011 episode of SmackDown, {{in his hometown of}} Toronto, Edge hosted The Cutting Edge between Mark Henry and the World Heavyweight Champion, Randy Orton. After the show went off the air, they held Edge Appreciation Night to celebrate his career.|$|E
5|$|WWE 2K16 {{introduces}} Working Holds, {{which allows}} the player {{to go through a}} collar-elbow tie-up situation in order to either damage the opponent or regain stamina to reverse the tide in the match. Dirty Pins now come in various animations and also A.I. for the referee is improved; for example, they break up collar-elbow tie-ups when the wrestlers are holding each other at the <b>corner</b> <b>for</b> too long. The Reversal Limit system was introduced to prevent players from reversing throughout the match, they come as minor and major ones depending on the class of the wrestler/diva. This method can be toggled on/off in the Options section.|$|E

5|$|Each {{platform}} has two same-level fare control areas, one {{at either}} end of the station, and there are no crossovers or crossunders. The full-time ones are at the north end and each has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two street stairs. The ones on the Manhattan-bound platform go up to the northeast and southeast corners of Bergen and Smith Streets while those on the Coney Island-bound platform go up to the northwest and southwest corners. The fare control areas on the south end of the platforms are unstaffed, containing full height turnstiles and one street stair to the northeast corner of Warren and Smith Streets on the Manhattan-bound platform and the northwest <b>corner</b> <b>for</b> the Coney Island-bound platform. The south fare control area is more heavily used.|$|E
5|$|Geen was {{selected}} to play for Oxford against Cambridge in four consecutive years from 1910 to 1913. In the first of these, on 13 December 1910, a 9,000-strong crowd turned up at Queen's, mostly to watch Ronnie Poulton, playing for Oxford. Cambridge started strong but a try by Bryn Lewis was disallowed in the opening minutes after a touch judge signalled that Geen had put his foot into touch in the preceding Oxford move. Moments later, Poulton ran through the Cambridge defence, drew the fullback and passed to Geen to dive in at the <b>corner</b> <b>for</b> a try. With Turner's conversion, Oxford led 5–0. A similar passage of play again saw Poulton put Geen through for a try, but he dropped the ball after crossing the line while trying {{to get closer to}} the posts.|$|E
5|$|In February 1976, Koubek {{contributed a}} third {{high-rise}} office building to Farragut Square, {{this one a}} brick-and-solarized glass structure with a glass-and-aluminum penthouse at 818 Connecticut Avenue NW. His massive, grid-like 400 North Capitol Street, {{one of the few}} office buildings he designed with a plaza between two wings, opened in June. His 12-story International Square building—with its inverted setbacks above the Farragut West Washington Metro station, ninth-floor balcony with non-structural columns, interior atrium, and ground level set-back retail concourse—opened in November. Originally just a single office building on a <b>corner</b> <b>for</b> a city block, it expanded to occupy nearly the entire block with the addition of two almost identical towers in 1979 and 1980. (The atrium was upgraded and a fountain added in 1992.) Two blocks to the west, in April 1977 Koubek also designed a fairly nondescript office building at 1990 K Street NW.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} {{began with a}} stare down. Luger gained the early {{advantage}} and managed to knock Yokozuna down by kicking the ring ropes into Yokozuna's groin. Luger tried to bodyslam Yokozuna, but the sumo wrestler's weight was too much. Yokozuna knocked {{him out of the}} ring and choked him. Yokozuna had his manager, Mr. Fuji, throw him a salt bucket, which he used to attack Luger. Yokozuna wore Luger down, and after a brief comeback by the all-American, hit a leg drop on Luger and pulled him to the <b>corner</b> <b>for</b> a Banzai Drop. After Yokozuna missed, Luger succeeded in bodyslamming Yokozuna, and he attacked Mr. Fuji when the manager tried to get involved. Luger knocked Yokozuna out of the ring with a forearm smash, and followed this up by attacking Jim Cornette. Yokozuna was counted out, but he retained the title because championships change hands only by pinfall or submission. Several faces came to the ring to celebrate with Luger as red, white and blue balloons fell from the ceiling to celebrate the victory.|$|E
5|$|After Victory Road, Cage befriended the {{new number}} one {{contender}} Sting on the July 27, 2006 episode of Impact!, by asking for forgiveness for doubting Sting's agenda by coming to TNA in January of that year. He {{went on to}} say that he had asked Jim Cornette the week before if he could be in Sting's corner in his match with Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at TNA's Hard Justice PPV event, but had told him he needed Sting's approval. Sting accepted Cage's offer, with interviewer and occasional ring announcer Jeremy Borash announcing Sting's decision in a backstage segment on the August 3, 2006 episode of Impact!. On August 13, 2006, Cage was in Sting's corner at Hard Justice as he faced Jarrett, with Scott Steiner in his <b>corner,</b> <b>for</b> the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. During the contest, Cage interfered to help Sting win numerous times, as did Steiner for Jarrett, until Cage turned on Sting by taking Jarrett's signature guitar and bashing it over his head—changing his character from a face to a heel. He then allowed Jarrett to pin Sting and retain the title.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal kicked-off {{the match}} {{and within the}} first two minutes forced Manchester United defender Gary Neville to concede a throw-in. In the fifth minute, Manchester United won a free kick, but nothing {{came out of it}} as José Antonio Reyes blocked Paul Scholes's shot. Good play by Reyes and Henry {{fashioned}} a chance for Bergkamp in the ninth minute, but his strike was off target. Two minutes later a shot by Bergkamp from outside the box was saved by Manchester United goalkeeper Tim Howard. Before Henry was about to take a <b>corner</b> <b>for</b> Arsenal in the 16th minute, a cigarette lighter was thrown at him from the section occupied by Manchester United supporters – this resulted in police making two arrests during the game. Quinton Fortune used his pace to get the better of Lauren, but his cross into the Arsenal penalty area was cleared by Pascal Cygan. Arsenal continued to threaten – Henry's free kick prompted Howard to make a save and tip the ball over the crossbar, and Bergkamp came close to scoring in the 27th minute after clever play to lose his marker John O'Shea. The football continued to move {{from one end to the}} other, with Giggs and Reyes causing problems for their respective defences. In stoppage time at the end of the first half, Henry had his shot saved by Howard, while Scholes was similarly denied by Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.|$|E

5|$|Buemi {{moved back}} ahead of Conway {{in the battle}} for fifth, while Lotterer was impeded by an LMP2 and LMGTE car at Becketts corner and Webber was delayed by the two {{vehicles}} at Stowe corner. Jarvis came across the two slower cars at Copse corner and narrowly held off an overtaking manoeuvre from Dumas. The Audi moved across the track at Becketts corner upon coming across more slower traffic. Webber caught Lotterer and after closing up to him through Club corner. While lapping Rossiter, Webber moved {{to the front of the}} race heading into Abbey corner. Webber began to pull away from Lotterer. Jarvis was delayed by Rossiter, allowing Dumas to attack but went into grass on the Wellington straight. After making contact Bruno Senna overtook Rusinov driving into Maggots <b>corner</b> <b>for</b> second place in LMP2. The first round of pit stops began after 37 minutes with Derani making a pit stop, promoting Senna into the LMP2 lead. Jarvis was the first of the overall leaders to make a pit stop for fuel and tyres and was followed by teammate Lotterer one minute later. Dumas and both Toyota cars made stops with Jani taking over from Dumas and Kamui Kobayashi switched positions with Conway. Webber stopped one lap later and Hartley climbed aboard the No. 1 Porsche.|$|E
5|$|Just {{after the}} start of the second half of extra time Cardiff made their final substitution, {{replacing}} McNaughton with Darcy Blake. Two minutes later Kuyt made a run from deep in the Liverpool half, his initial shot was blocked, but the ball rebounded towards him. As the ball came back to him he shot again and the ball went past Heaton and into the Cardiff goal to give Liverpool a 2–1 lead. Cardiff were struggling after the goal with a number of their players suffering from cramp. Nevertheless, they had a chance in the 111th minute, when a Gunnarsson long throw was only half-cleared by Liverpool, but they were unable to convert the chance. Towards the end of the half Cardiff began to exert more pressure on Liverpool. Turner, who had been moved into the striker position won a <b>corner</b> <b>for</b> Cardiff, which was punched away by Reina for a throw-in. Cardiff won another from the throw, which found Kiss, whose shot was cleared off the line of the Liverpool goal by Kuyt for another corner. The subsequent corner was headed on by Gunnarsson to Turner, who beat Kuyt to the ball and put his shot past Reina into the Liverpool goal to level the score at 2–2. Turner was shown a yellow card for removing his shirt during the celebration of the goal. Liverpool won a corner with a minute remaining but they were unable to score and the referee brought extra time to an end with the scores level, resulting in a penalty shoot-out.|$|E
5|$|The {{next game}} was against Cardiff on 26 December. It {{was billed as}} a virtual second Test against a side that boasted several Test players. The match was played at Cardiff Arms Park in front of 50,000 spectators. After a missed drop goal and missed penalty Cardiff scored with a try to Nicholls that {{was set up by}} Gabe. The {{conversion}} was successful giving Cardiff a 5–0 lead. about 20 minutes into the match Jim O'Sullivan broke his collarbone after being tackled heavily; as a result the All Blacks played the rest of the match with only 14 men. The All Blacks attacked with every opportunity they could and before half time Mona Thomson scored in the <b>corner</b> <b>for</b> the All Blacks. Wallace converted the try to leave the scores 5–5 at half time. For the first 30 minutes of the second half the two teams attacked one after the other. After Cardiff captain Percy Bush failed to force down a ball behind his own goal-line George Nicholson dived on the ball to score a try. Wallace converted to give the All Blacks a 10–5 lead. Cardiff responded by scoring a try themselves, but Winfield failed to convert it and the All Blacks won 10–8. The loss was Cardiff's only loss of the season, and the next year they defeated the touring South Africans 17–0.|$|E
40|$|While {{statistical}} analysis {{has been considered}} as an important tool for nanoscale integrated circuit design, many IC designers {{would like to know}} the design-specific worst-case <b>corners</b> <b>for</b> circuit debugging and failure diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to efficiently extract the worst-case <b>corners</b> <b>for</b> nanoscale ICs. Our proposed approach mathematically formulates a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem <b>for</b> <b>corner</b> extraction. Next, it applies the Lagrange duality theory to convert the non-convex QCQP problem to a convex semi-definite programming (SDP) problem that is easier to solve. Our circuit example designed in a commercial CMOS process demonstrates that the proposed SDP formulation can find the worst-case corners both efficiently and robustly, while the traditional QCQP fails to achieve global convergence...|$|R

5|$|While {{coming across}} the Piquet and Rossiter battle Lotterer moved in front of {{teammate}} Jarvis to claim second place. Rusinov entered the pit lane from the LMP2 lead for left-rear bodywork repairs and Rast was handed the No. 26 Oreca. Piquet was able to pass Rossiter for eighth position overall while Turner moved ahead of the other Ford car to run in third in LMGTE Pro. The second round of pit stops began one minute later when Jarvis entered the pit lane and {{the remainder of the}} LMP1 field followed in response for driver changes. Benoît Tréluyer pushed hard and lost control of his car's back-end at Vale corner, allowing Jani to move into second position. Christensen's right-front tyre was punctured at Becketts corner and he made a pit stop for a replacement wheel which promoted Turner to second in the class. After changing drivers in the No. 42 Strakka Racing Gibson, Danny Watts overtook González at Brooklands <b>corner</b> <b>for</b> second position in LMP2. Hartley went to the outside of Wainwright driving through Farm Curve and his car's right-front quarter made contact with Wainwright's left-rear section. Hartley went over the bonnet of the No. 86 Porsche but avoided flipping over; both cars went off the track, skidding across the gravel trap, and into the barriers {{at the end of the}} Complex. Both Hartley and Wainwright retired from the event and a full course yellow flag was necessitated to allow the cars to be extracted from the track.|$|E
