5|$|Ebla {{maintained}} its prosperity through a vast trading network. Artifacts from Sumer, Cyprus, Egypt {{and as far}} as Afghanistan were recovered from the city's palaces. The kingdom had its own language, Eblaite and the political organization of Ebla had features different from the Sumerian model. Women enjoyed a special status and the queen had major influence in the state and religious affairs. The pantheon of gods was mainly north Semitic and included deities exclusive to Ebla. The city was excavated starting in 1964, and became famous for the Ebla tablets, an archive of about 20,000 <b>cuneiform</b> tablets found there, dated to around 2350 BC. Written in both Sumerian and Eblaite and using the <b>cuneiform,</b> the archive has allowed {{a better understanding of the}} Sumerian language and provided important information over the political organization and social customs of the mid third millennium BC's Levant.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>cuneiforms</b> are paired cartilages {{that sit}} {{on top of}} and move with the arytenoids. [...] They are located above {{and in front of}} the corniculate cartilages, and the {{presence}} of these two pairs of cartilages result in small bulges {{on the surface of the}} mucous membrane.Covered by the aryepiglottic folds, the <b>cuneiforms</b> form the lateral aspect of the laryngeal inlet, while the corniculates form the posterior aspect, and the epiglottis the anterior.|$|R
50|$|The bones {{entering}} into their formation are the first, second, and third <b>cuneiforms,</b> and the cuboid bone, which articulate with {{the bases of}} the metatarsal bones.|$|R

5|$|In 1923 German {{archaeologist}} Ernst Herzfeld made casts of the <b>cuneiform</b> inscriptions on Darius's tomb. They {{are currently}} {{housed in the}} archives of the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Museum, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC.|$|E
5|$|Pots and vessels {{were also}} recovered. Pots {{were used for}} cooking, while the large vessels for food import from Oman and Mesopotamia. Artifacts found there {{indicates}} the location. These include a <b>cuneiform</b> inscription and hematite, both of which link to Mesopotamia; steatite bowls to Oman; and carnelian beads, a stone weight and a few potsherds to the Indus Civilization.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of excavations, over 25,000 clay tablets in Akkadian language written in <b>cuneiform</b> were discovered. Finds from the excavation are {{on display in the}} Louvre, the National Museum of Aleppo, the National Museum of Damascus, and the Deir ez-Zor Museum. In the latter, the southern façade of the Court of the Palms room from Zimri-Lim's palace has been reconstructed, including the wall paintings.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to present a neglected, unclassifiable case that {{involved}} a central type polydactyl adult with 7 toes and metatarsals, 4 <b>cuneiforms</b> and 1 cuboid. A 22 year-old male soldier with a right polydactyl was referred to our hospital. He suffered from the need of excessively wide-shoes and occasional shoe irritation. He was evaluated with plain radiography and 3 D tomography. The patient had central-type polydactyl with 7 toes and metatarsals, and 4 <b>cuneiforms</b> and 1 cuboid. Ankles and hind feet were completely normal. All toes were capable of tendon flexion and extension. His medical and family history was unremarkable. We planned to excise the excessive toes and metatarsals, but the patient denied the surgery. We present a very rare case with a central polydactyl having 7 toes and metatarsals, 4 <b>cuneiforms</b> and 1 cuboid. The striking point in our case was that he was a neglected, unclassifiable case.

5|$|The {{architect}} Tiratur built a square-planned gavit (narthex) west of Church of Surb Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother of God) in 1648. It {{functioned as}} a church during the 19th century, called Surb Gevorg. To {{the west of the}} narthex was a 17th-century three-arched open-air porch; to the north was Church of Surb Khach (Holy Cross); while to the south was the 17th-century Church of Surb Sion. Urartian <b>cuneiform</b> inscriptions were used as lintels on their western entrances.|$|E
5|$|Ten Freedom Summers is a four-disc box set by American trumpeter and {{composer}} Wadada Leo Smith. It {{was released on}} May 5, 2012, by <b>Cuneiform</b> Records. Smith wrote its compositions intermittently {{over the course of}} 34 years, beginning in 1977, before performing them live in November 2011 at the Colburn School's Zipper Hall in Los Angeles. He was accompanied by the nine-piece Southwest Chamber Music ensemble and his own jazz quartet, featuring drummers Pheeroan akLaff and Susie Ibarra, pianist Anthony Davis, and bassist John Lindberg.|$|E
5|$|The British Museum {{announced}} in January 2010 that two inscribed clay fragments, {{which had been}} in the Museum's collection since 1881, had been identified as part of a <b>cuneiform</b> tablet that was inscribed with the same text as the Cyrus Cylinder. The fragments had come from the small site of Dailem near Babylon and the identification was made by Professor Wilfred Lambert, formerly of the University of Birmingham, and Irving Finkel, curator in charge of the Museum's Department of the Middle East.|$|E

5|$|The oldest known {{detailed}} {{record of}} the disease itself is in the Sakikku, a Babylonian <b>cuneiform</b> medical text from 10671046 BC. This text gives signs and symptoms, details treatment and likely outcomes, and describes many features of the different seizure types. As the Babylonians had no biomedical {{understanding of the nature}} of disease, they attributed the seizures to possession by evil spirits and called for treating the condition through spiritual means. Around 900 BC, Punarvasu Atreya described epilepsy as loss of consciousness; this definition was carried forward into the Ayurvedic text of Charaka Samhita (about 400 BC).|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Darius {{sponsored}} large {{construction projects}} in Susa, Babylon, Egypt, and Persepolis. In Susa, Darius {{built a new}} palace complex {{in the north of}} the city. An inscription states that the palace was destroyed during the reign of Artaxerxes I, but was rebuilt. Today only glazed bricks of the palace remain, the majority of them in the Louvre. In Pasargadae Darius finished all incomplete construction projects from the reign of Cyrus the Great. A palace was also built during the reign of Darius, with an inscription in the name of Cyrus the Great. It was previously believed that Cyrus had constructed this building, however due to the <b>cuneiform</b> script being used, the palace {{is believed to have been}} constructed by Darius.|$|E
5|$|At {{some time}} between his {{coronation}} and his death, Darius left a tri-lingual monumental relief on Mount Behistun, {{which was written}} in Elamite, Old Persian and Babylonian. The inscription begins with a brief autobiography including his ancestry and lineage. To aid the presentation of his ancestry, Darius wrote down {{the sequence of events}} that occurred after the death of Cyrus the Great. Darius mentions several times that he is the rightful king by the grace of Ahura Mazda, the Zoroastrian god. In addition, further texts and monuments from Persepolis have been found, as well as a clay tablet containing an Old Persian <b>cuneiform</b> of Darius from Gherla, Romania (Harmatta) and a letter from Darius to Gadates, preserved in a Greek text of the Roman period.|$|E

Diagnosis by clinical and radiographic ex-amination was supplemented by stress fluoroscopy of the articulation under anesthesia. Injuries were classi-fied as either a first- or second-degree sprain of the tarsometatarsal joint, a third-degree sprain (with dias-tasis between the metatarsals or <b>cuneiforms),</b> a frac-ture, or frank dislocation. Poor functional results were seen in those for whom diagnosis was delayed and for whom the injury was not treated adequately.

50|$|The exocortex concept {{also has}} roots in {{evolutionary}} psychology {{as a result}} of Merlin Donald of Queen's University. Donald, in the 1990 book Origins of the Modern Mind as well as later papers, proposed an evolutionary model of the mind, from a functionary perspective, from its origins in prehistoric apes to the modern human being. Donald focuses significant attention on the use that modern humans make of external symbolic storage and manipulation systems—the range of technologies from <b>cuneiforms,</b> hieroglyphics, and ideograms to alphabetic languages, mathematics and now computers. From Donald's perspective, these external symbolic systems have allowed for the functional reorganization of the human mind in how it deals with the world.|$|R
5|$|Images {{of musical}} {{instruments}} begin {{to appear in}} Mesopotamian artifacts in 2800 BC or earlier. Beginning around 2000 BC, Sumerian and Babylonian cultures began delineating two distinct classes of musical instruments due to division of labor and the evolving class system. Popular instruments, simple and playable by anyone, evolved differently from professional instruments whose development focused on effectiveness and skill. Despite this development, very few musical instruments have been recovered in Mesopotamia. Scholars must rely on artifacts and <b>cuneiform</b> texts written in Sumerian or Akkadian to reconstruct {{the early history of}} musical instruments in Mesopotamia. Even the process of assigning names to these instruments is challenging since there is no clear distinction among various instruments and the words used to describe them.|$|E
5|$|The {{invention}} of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary {{with the beginning of}} the Bronze Age in the late 4th millennium BC. The Sumerian archaic <b>cuneiform</b> script and the Egyptian hieroglyphs are generally considered to be the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BC with the earliest coherent texts from about 2600 BC. It is generally agreed that Sumerian writing was an independent invention; however, it is debated whether Egyptian writing was developed completely independently of Sumerian, or was a case of cultural diffusion. A similar debate exists for the Chinese script, which developed around 1200 BC. The pre-Columbian Mesoamerican writing systems (including among others Olmec and Maya scripts) are generally believed to have had independent origins.|$|E
5|$|While {{there is}} no {{absolute}} consensus about the adherence of the kings before Darius, such as Cyrus and Cambyses, it is well established that Darius was an adherent of Zoroastrianism {{or at least a}} firm believer in Ahura Mazda. As can be seen at the Behistun Inscription, Darius believed that Ahura Mazda had appointed him to rule the Achaemenid Empire. Darius had dualistic philosophical convictions and believed that each rebellion in his kingdom was the work of druj, the enemy of Asha. Darius believed that because he lived righteously by Asha, Ahura Mazda supported him. In many <b>cuneiform</b> inscriptions denoting his achievements, he presents himself as a devout believer, perhaps even convinced that he had a divine right to rule over the world.|$|E
50|$|At the {{posterior}} {{part of the}} metatarsus and the anterior part of the tarsus the arches are complete, {{but in the middle}} of the tarsus they present more the characters of half-domes, the concavities of which are directed downward and medialward, so that when the medial borders of the feet are placed in apposition a complete tarsal dome is formed. The transverse arch is composed of the three <b>cuneiforms,</b> the cuboid, and the five metatarsal bases. The transverse arch is strengthened by the interosseous, plantar, and dorsal ligaments, by the short muscles of the first and fifth toes (especially the transverse head of the Adductor hallucis), and by the Peronæus longus, whose tendon stretches across between the piers of the arches.|$|R
40|$|A 14 -year-old {{girl with}} a congenitally {{deformed}} and shortened right leg and foot is described. The patient could not bear weight on the deformed limb and had to hop on the left leg.

Radiologically, the lower end ofthe right femur was ill-developed {{and there was no}} kneejomt. There were two fibulae and the tibia and the patella were absent. A through-knee disarticulation was done and a prosthesis fitted later. The amputated leg and foot were dissected. Many ofthe muscles in the leg and foot were duplicated.

40|$|Actes de la conférence internationale "Origins of Early Writing Systems", October 5 to 7, 2007,Peking University, BeijingConcerning the {{question}} of Luwians hieroglyphics, {{a certain number of}} debates have arisen, especially about its origin, the place and date of its manifestation. About the first point, some researchers go for a foreign origin, but most of them agree on the fact that hieroglyphics were produced by the Hittites. Nevertheless, two points still remain: the right moment the hieroglyphics become a writing system proper; the kind of relationships between Luwians hieroglyphics and <b>cuneiforms</b> used by Hittites. I would examine the change from a system of symbols used for administrative or commercial exchanges to the system regarded as hieroglyphic, strictly speaking. Can critiria be defined? Can processes be depicted? Can models be proposed, and be generalized and applied to other writing systems...|$|R
5|$|The first civilization {{known to}} have a {{functional}} theory of the planets were the Babylonians, who lived in Mesopotamia {{in the first and}} second millennia BC. The oldest surviving planetary astronomical text is the Babylonian Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa, a 7th-century BC copy of a list of observations of the motions of the planet Venus, that probably dates as early as the second millennium BC. The MUL.APIN is a pair of <b>cuneiform</b> tablets dating from the 7th century BC that lays out the motions of the Sun, Moon, and planets {{over the course of the}} year. The Babylonian astrologers also laid the foundations of what would eventually become Western astrology. The Enuma anu enlil, written during the Neo-Assyrian period in the 7th century BC, comprises a list of omens and their relationships with various celestial phenomena including the motions of the planets. Venus, Mercury, and the outer planets Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn were all identified by Babylonian astronomers. These would remain the only known planets until the invention of the telescope in early modern times.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the {{putative}} artifact goes back almost a century. The earliest record goes back to a Chinese doctor named Xue Shenwei, who sometime prior to 1928 was shown {{a photo of a}} rubbing of one of the bones by an antiquities dealer named Zhang Yi'an. Although not able to view the bones at that time, Xue Shenwei later acquired one of them from another antiquities dealer named Wang Dongting in 1935 and then the second via a personal connection named Ke Yanling around 1940. While Xue did not recognize the script on the bones he guessed at its antiquity and buried the bones for safekeeping during the Cultural Revolution. Then, in 1983 Xue presented the bones to the Palace Museum in Beijing where Liu Jiuan and Wang Nanfang of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage undertook their study. These officials identified the script as <b>cuneiform</b> and asked the Assyriologists Chi Yang and Wu Yuhong to work on the inscriptions. Identification of the source text proceeded slowly until 1985, when Wu Yuhong along with Oxford Assyriologist Stephanie Dalley and Oliver Gurney recognized the text in one bone as coming from the Cyrus Cylinder. One year later Wu Yuhong presented his findings at the 33rd Rencontre Assyriologique and published them in a journal article.|$|E

5000|$|Sales of {{artifacts}} {{may be the}} second largest source of funding for ISIL. More {{than a third of}} Iraq's important sites are under ISIL's control. It looted the 9th century BC grand palace of the Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II at Kalhu (Nimrud). Tablets, manuscripts and <b>cuneiforms</b> were sold, worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Stolen artifacts are smuggled into Turkey and Jordan. Abdulamir al-Hamdani, an archaeologist from SUNY Stony Brook, has said that ISIL is [...] "looting... the very roots of humanity, artefacts from the oldest civilizations in the world". It is difficult to accurately measure the revenue from artifacts, as they are primarily sold on the black market, but National Geographic estimates it may be in the tens of millions USD. As well as selling artifacts themselves, ISIL taxes traffickers smuggling them across ISIL's territory.|$|R
40|$|Erosive bony lesions are {{radiographic}} findings where localized bone resorption and cortical line breakage occurs. One {{less common}} cause of bone erosions is arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). This should always {{be included in the}} differentials for foot pain. A 33 -year-old gentleman presented with a 5 -year history of chronic left foot pain. Clinical examination was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography demonstrated erosive bone changes in the navicular, the intermediate and lateral <b>cuneiforms</b> bones and their corresponding metatarsal bases. An ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiogram demonstrated high signal showing the abnormal communication between metatarsal artery and vein at the site of most pain confirming the AVM. This was subsequently successfully treated with sclerotherapy.

40|$|The use of ankle {{external}} fixator to treat pilon fracture Type III is popular amongst surgeons {{as it can}} reduce complications such as non-union and mal-union. Even though configurations of the connecting bars are important, the material also plays a major factor for a successful outcome. In this paper, the Delta {{external fixator}} with simulated ankle pilon fractures Type III were modelled and analysed under two different materials; titanium alloy and stainless steel. The finite element model includes tibia, fibula, talus, calcaneus, cuboid, navicular, three <b>cuneiforms</b> and five metatarsals bone. To simulate the pilon fractures Type III, a cutting segment was utilised. The ligaments were assigned with linear spring properties and cartilages were modelled using Mooney-Rivlin hyper-elastic behaviour. The Delta external fixator was designed using a three-dimensional software with two different material properties - titanium alloy and stainless steel. High von Mises stress concentrated at the pin-bone interface with the highest value observed for the titanium fixation. The results also showed less deformation for the stainless steel compared to titanium...|$|R
