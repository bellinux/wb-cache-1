5000|$|Luigi Galvani, a {{lecturer}} at the University of Bologna, was researching {{the nervous system}} of frogs from around 1780. This research included the muscular response to opiates and static electricity, for which experiments the spinal cord and rear legs of a frog were dissected out together and the skin removed. In 1781, an observation was made while a frog was being so dissected. An electric machine discharged just at the moment one of Galvani's assistants touched the <b>crural</b> <b>nerve</b> of a dissected frog with a scalpel. The frog's legs twitched as the discharge happened. [...] Galvani found {{that he could make}} the prepared leg of a frog (see the Construction section) twitch by connecting a metal circuit from a nerve to a muscle, thus inventing the first frog galvanoscope. [...] Galvani published these results in 1791 in De viribus electricitatis.|$|E
40|$|A 73 -year-old man was {{admitted}} for rupture of an atherosclerotic aneurysm of the {{profunda femoris artery}} associated to popliteal and bilateral axillary arteries aneurysms. The aneurysm of the profunda femoris artery was developed between {{the branches of the}} crural nerves. Considering the patency of the superficial femoral artery and of the leg arterie, and to avoid injury to the <b>crural</b> <b>nerve,</b> no reconstruction of the profunda femoris was attempted. The aneurysm was ligated proximally and buttress sutures were placed on the site of rupture to achieve thrombosis of the aneurysms. Most of the published cases of aneurysm of the profunda femoris artery are false aneurysms developed after various trauma. Atherosclerotic aneurysm of the profunda femoris artery is a rare lesion and rupture is exceptional. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} case of a female patient with {{cutaneous}} manifestations of leprosy, whose clinical presentation was atypical and of torpid evolution. From disease onset, the patient developed polymorphic skin lesions accompanied by sensory disturbances. The initial diagnosis was indeterminate leprosy. Multibacillary treatment was indicated. After two years of evolution, given the exacerbation of lesions and general symptoms worsening, biopsy was performed again, providing the following histological result: Hansen dimorphic, the result of the sputum smear being negative. In 2001, a nerve conduction study showed axomielynic damage in the sensory fibers of the right <b>crural</b> <b>nerve.</b> In 2004 the patient presented hives without stinging that left white stains when they disappeared. From that date until 2008 she continued to refer the disease. Multidisciplinary interconsultation was performed in coordination with the national team leader and she was assessed at the meeting of specialists in Havana City, where they initiated therapy with rifampicin, ofloxacin and minocycline, under which she remained for a year, with a satisfactory outcome...|$|E

40|$|Subramanian HH, Holstege G. Midbrain and {{medullary}} {{control of}} postinspiratory {{activity of the}} crural and costal diaphragm in vivo. J Neurophysiol 105 : 2852 - 2862, 2011. First published March 30, 2011; doi: 10. 1152 /jn. 00168. 2011. -Studies on brain stem respiratory neurons suggest that eupnea consists of three phases: inspiration, postinspiration, and expiration. However, it is not well understood how postinspiration is organized in the diaphragm, i. e., whether postinspiration differs in the crural and costal segments of the diaphragm and what the influence is of postinspiratory neurons on diaphragm function during eupnea. In this in vivo study we investigated the postinspiratory activity of the two diaphragm segments during eupnea and the changes in diaphragm function following modulation of eupnea. Postinspiratory neurons in the medulla were stereotaxically localized extracellularly and neurochemically stimulated. We used three types of preparations: precollicularly decerebrated unanesthetized cats and rats and anesthetized rats. In all preparations, during eupnea, postinspiratory activity {{was found in the}} crural but not in the costal diaphragm. When eupnea was discontinued in decerebrate cats in which stimulation in the nucleus retroambiguus induced activation of laryngeal or abdominal muscles, all postinspiratory activity in the crural diaphragm was abolished. In decerebrate rats, stimulation of the midbrain periaqueductal gray abolished postinspiration in the crural diaphragm but induced activation in the costal diaphragm. In anesthetized rats, stimulation of medullary postinspiratory neurons abolished the postinspiratory activity of the <b>crural</b> diaphragm. Vagal <b>nerve</b> stimulation in these rats increased the intensity of postinspiratory neuronal discharge in the solitary nucleus, leading to decreased activity of the crural diaphragm. These data demonstrate that three-phase breathing in the crural diaphragm during eupnea exists in vivo and that postinspiratory neurons have an inhibitory effect on crural diaphragm function...|$|R
40|$|In {{the period}} between 1950 and i 960 {{there were a number}} of reports of the {{relative}} insensitivity of insect nerves and ganglia to various electrolytes, drugs and toxicants which affected vertebrate nervous systems. Examples include: potassium acting on the <b>crural</b> <b>nerve</b> of the locust, Locusta migratoria (Hoyle, 1952, 1953); potassium and acetylcholine acting on ganglia of the American cockroach Periplaneta americana (Twarog & Roeder, 1956, 1957); ionic organophosphate penetration into the nerve cord of the American cockroach (O'Brien, 1959). These findings, coupled with the finding that ionized drugs and toxicants had unexpectedly little effect on insects (O'Brien & Fisher, 1958; Kolbezen, Metcalf & Fukuto, 1954), led to the widely accepted view that insect nerves, and especially insect ganglia, were protected from cations, perhaps by the sheath or sheaths which invest most insect ganglia and nerves. Since insect ganglia are comparable to the brain and spinal cord of vertebrates, such pro-tection would be like that offered by the so-called 'blood-brain barrier ' of vertebrates. The existence of an ion-barrier was challenged when it was shown with radioactive materials that K+, Na+, Ca*+ and acetylcholine enter readily the nerve cord of th...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The Wagner cone stem was {{designed}} for uncemented hip arthroplasty in difficult proximal femoral conditions or femoral deformities. The most common indications {{for the use of}} this stem are secondary hip arthritis due to developmental hip dysplasia, septic arthritis or congenital malformations. We present a case series of patients that underwent hip arthroplasty {{with the use of a}} Wagner cone stem. Materials and methods: A retrospective chart review of 17 patients (15 women and 2 men) was performed with a mean age of 39 (25 - 62). Clinical evaluation was rated with the Merlé D´Aubigné score. Radiographic evaluation consisted in antero posterior and axial views of the hip. One patient was operated bilaterally, with a total of 18 hips operated, and mean follow up of 8 years (5 - 12). Results: Diagnosis of secondary arthritis was: developmental hip dysplasia in 12 patients, septic arthritis sequelae in 3 patients and other causes of hip arthritis in 3 patients. Average Merlé-D´Aubigné score was 9, 9 (8 - 13) preoperatively and 16, 10 (13 - 18) at last follow-up. One patient presented <b>crural</b> <b>nerve</b> paresia after surgery, which was recovered completely and one stem was reviewed due to aseptic loosening. Discussion: The Wagner cone stem has successfully resolved cases with abnormalities in the proximal femur in patients with secondary hip arthritis. Although this procedure is not exempt of complications, it has shown good stability which translates into good results in the medium to long term...|$|E
