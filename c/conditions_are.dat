50|$|The <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> {{common for}} older adults; over 75% of those {{over the age}} of 65 develop it.

5|$|Many {{species of}} animal are kept as pets, the most popular being mammals, {{especially}} dogs and cats.

5|$|Monocyte- and macrophage-related {{cutaneous}} <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> characterized histologically by {{infiltration of}} the skin by monocyte or macrophage cells, often divided into several categories, including granulomatous disease, histiocytoses, and sarcoidosis.|$|E
5|$|Mycosis-related {{cutaneous}} <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> {{caused by}} fungi or yeasts, and may present {{as either a}} superficial or deep infection of the skin, hair, or nails.|$|E
40|$|There {{are still}} many things to be found out about {{interstitial}} cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) because the pathological processes underlying the <b>condition</b> <b>are</b> not yet elucidated, biological markers of the <b>condition</b> <b>are</b> not yet available, and the type and severity of symptoms can vary, so, clearly defining the <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> not yet possible...|$|R

50|$|Usually, {{a common}} form of {{treatment}} for the <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> a type of hand cream which moisturises the hard skin. However, currently the <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> incurable.|$|R
5|$|The common {{term for}} a place at which one may dive is a dive site. As a general rule, {{professional}} diving is done where the work needs to be done, and recreational diving is done where <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> suitable. There are many recorded and publicised recreational dive sites which {{are known for their}} convenience, points of interest, and frequently favourable conditions. Diver training facilities for both professional and recreational divers generally use a small range of dive sites which are familiar and convenient, and where <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> predictable and the risk is relatively low.|$|E

30|$|The {{operating}} <b>conditions</b> <b>were</b> as follows: Aerobic condition {{means an}} agitation at 800  rpm and an aeration rate of 2.0  L/min. Anaerobic <b>conditions</b> <b>were</b> maintained at an agitation of 150  rpm without any aeration whereas low aeration/agitation <b>conditions</b> <b>were</b> provided at a stirring rate of 150  rpm and an aeration rate of 0.4  L/min. 150  rpm was the minimum stirring rate required in medium mixing. The two-step fermentation (the first 24  hours under anaerobic condition, thereafter, aerobic <b>condition)</b> <b>was</b> performed according to Heinrich et al., 2013.|$|R
50|$|The <b>condition</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{named for}} German physician Georg Sack, who described {{a single case}} in 1936, and British surgeon A.P. Barabas, who described two cases in 1967. Barabas recognized that the <b>condition</b> <b>was</b> a form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a group of inherited disorders affecting connective tissue. This <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> now called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, vascular type EDS type IV.|$|R
5000|$|This <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> rare with an {{estimated}} incidence of 1/40,000 males. Although this <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> not normally fatal eventually 20% of those affected may need a wheelchair.|$|R

5|$|According to {{the solar}} nebular disk model, rocky planets {{form in the}} inner part of the protoplanetary disk, within the frost line, where the {{temperature}} is high enough to prevent condensation of water ice and other substances into grains. This results in coagulation of purely rocky grains {{and later in the}} formation of rocky planetesimals. Such <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> thought to exist in the inner 3–4AU part of the disk of a Sun-like star.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with wind}} direction, cloud cover {{is one of}} the oldest {{atmospheric}} conditions to be coded on a station model. The circle in the middle of the station model represents cloud cover. In the United Kingdom, when the observation is taken from an automated weather observation site, the shape is a triangle. If the shape is completely filled in, it is overcast. If <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> completely clear, the circle or triangle is empty. If <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> partly cloudy, the circle or triangle is partially filled in. The cloud cover shape has different looks depending upon how many oktas (eighths of the sky) are covered by cloud. A sky half full of clouds would have a circle that was half white and half black. Below the shape indicating sky cover, the station model can indicate the coverage of low clouds, in oktas, and the ceiling height in hundreds of feet. The ceiling height is the height at which more than half the sky is covered by clouds.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> either {{fulfilled}} or not, {{according to}} whether a prescribed event does or does not take place. If the <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> fulfilled, it has an automatic effect, either creating or cancelling a contractual obligation.
