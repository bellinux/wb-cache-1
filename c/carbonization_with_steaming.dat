40|$|AbstractSteam-activated carbons DS 2 and DS 5 were {{prepared}} by gasifying 600 °C-date pits <b>carbonization</b> products <b>with</b> <b>steam</b> at 950 °C to burn-off= 20 and 50 %, respectively. The textural properties of these carbons were determined from the nitrogen adsorption at − 196 °C. The chemistry {{of the carbon}} surface was determined from the surface pH and from neutralization of the surface carbon–oxygen groups of basic and acidic type. The kinetic and equilibrium adsorption of MB and RY on DS 2 and DS 5 was determined at 27 and 37 °C and at initial sorption solution pH 3 – 7. DS 2 and DS 5 have expanded surface area, large total pore volume and contain both micro and mesoporosity. They have on their surface basic and acidic groups of different strength and functionality. This enhanced the sorption of the cationic dye (MB) and of the anionic dye (RY). The adsorption of MB and RY on DS 2 and DS 5 involves intraparticle diffusion and followed pseudo-second order kinetics. The adsorption isotherms were applicable to the Langmuir isotherm and high monolayer capacities for MB and RY dyes were evaluated indicating the high efficiencies of the carbons for dye adsorption...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, an {{effort has been}} made to develop {{suitable}} process conditions for synthesis of carbon molecular sieve (CMS) from a locally available palm shell of Tenera type. The process involves three stages; <b>carbonization,</b> physical activation <b>with</b> <b>steam,</b> and carbon deposition by using benzene cracking technique. The highest micropore volume of activated carbon was obtained at 53. 2 burn-off, which is then used as a precursor for CMS production. In order to narrow down the pore mouth size to a required size, benzene was cracked at 800 Â°C for 15 - 60 min. The characterization of the samples was assessed by physical adsorption of N 2 at 77 K. The adsorption kinetic of CO 2, CH 4, O 2 and N 2 were measured at room temperature {{in order to determine the}} sample behavior as CMS...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were conducted to produce carbon molecular sieves (CMS) through carbon deposition from a locally available palm shell of Tenera type for separating gaseous mixtures. The process involves three stages; <b>carbonization,</b> physical activation <b>with</b> <b>steam,</b> and carbon deposition by using benzene cracking technique. Carbonization of the dried palm shells was occurred at 900 degrees C for duration of 1 h followed by steam activation at 830 degrees C for 30 - 420 min to obtain activated carbons with different degree of burn-offs. The highest micropore volume of activated carbon obtained at 53. 2 burn-off {{was used as a}} precursor for CMS production. Subsequent carbon deposition of the activated sample at temperature range from 600 to 900 degrees C for 30 min has resulted in a series of CMSs with different selectivities of CO 2 /CH 4 and O- 2 /N- 2. The kinetic adsorption isotherm of CO 2, CH 4, O- 2 and N- 2 at room temperature also presented in this work...|$|R
