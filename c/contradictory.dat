5|$|A <b>contradictory</b> figure, Caion was {{equated with}} infamy and ridicule in the Romanian context, and his evidently {{unsubstantiated}} allegations against Caragiale have traditionally puzzled literary historians.

50|$|A {{universal}} affirmative proposition, such as, 'Every man is white' and {{a universal}} negative proposition {{having the same}} subject and predicate, such as, 'No man is white,' are called contrary. A universal affirmative proposition ("Every man is white") and the non-universal denial of that proposition in a way ("Some man is not white") are called <b>contradictories.</b> Of <b>contradictories,</b> one must be true, the other false. Contraries cannot both be true, although they can both be false, and hence their <b>contradictories</b> are both true (for example, both, 'Every man is honest,' and 'No man is honest,' are false. But their <b>contradictories,</b> 'Some men are not honest,' and, 'Some men are honest,' are both true.|$|R

5|$|Antioxidants, such as {{vitamins}} C and E, {{have been}} proposed {{to protect against the}} disease, but results of studies have been <b>contradictory</b> and no positive effect has been proven. The results regarding fat and fatty acids have been <b>contradictory,</b> with various studies reporting protective effects, risk-increasing effects or no effects. There have been preliminary indications that the use of anti-inflammatory drugs and calcium channel blockers may be protective. A 2010 meta-analysis found that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (apart from aspirin), have been associated with at least a 15 percent (higher in long-term and regular users) reduction of incidence of the development of Parkinson's disease.|$|E
5|$|As John Wilson {{and others}} have noted, it is {{difficult}} to define leisure. Its definitions are numerous and often mutually <b>contradictory,</b> for example as a discrete portion of one's time or as a quality of experience irrespective of time. Joffre Dumazedier distinguished four distinct definitions of leisure, which begin broadly and gradually narrow in scope. The first and broadest defines leisure as a style of behavior that may occur even at work, the second defines it as any non-work activity; the third further excludes family and household obligations; and, finally, the narrowest defines leisure as activities dedicated to self-fulfillment. Dumazedier's four definitions are not exhaustive. Incompatible definitions and measures are seen as a major factor accounting for occasionally <b>contradictory</b> research findings.|$|E

He then proposes that [...] "there cannot be an intermediate between <b>contradictories,</b> but of one subject we must either affirm or deny any one predicate" [...] (Book IV, CH 7, p. 531). In the context of Aristotle's traditional logic, this is a remarkably precise statement of the law of excluded middle, P ∨ ¬P.|$|R

5|$|Fairman {{writes that}} legal {{precedent}} regarding {{use of the}} word is unclear because of <b>contradictory</b> court decisions. He presents case studies of these <b>contradictory</b> applications of the law, and uses them to analyze public perceptions surrounding freedom of speech. He provides examples of exceptions to the First Amendment, such as speech intended to cause violent acts, and discusses the manner in which federal and state governments sanction these exceptions. Fairman draws parallels between protection of comedians' usage of taboo language to the ability of individuals in society to express ideas freely. He argues that once citizens allow the government to restrict specific words {{that can be used in}} speech, this will lead to an encroachment upon freedom of thought.|$|E
