40|$|Spanish {{regulation}} on dam safety {{recommends the}} estimation of a return period of 1000 years for the Design Flood and of 10, 000 for the Safety <b>Check</b> <b>Flood.</b> The criteria used for the calculations are based on Flood frequency analysis (FFA) from gauge record data or on the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) which is the hypothetical maximums of rainfall turned into runoff. The short gauge records affords little support for the FFA and for the hypothetical PMF, which in addition {{the absence of a}} probability associated, limits the utility of these indices for risk-based dam safety decisions. Palaeoflood techniques are a means to directly assess the probability of extreme floods and test the validity of the PMF-based models. In this paper, palaeoflood record was applied to a case study in the Guadalentín river, upstream of the Valdeinfierno reservoir (372 km 2). The Valdeinfierno dam spillway has a capacity of 550 m 3 s- 1. (design flood). In addition, available historical flood data was collected. Palaeoflood data, together with the gauge record, was combined for the FFA, using existing methods for the fitting of distribution functions, such as the maximum likelihood. These return periods are compared with the PMF results. Palaeoflood analysis provides a discharge of 2350 m 3 s- 1 for the design flood (1000 -yr return period), and 3450 m 3 s- 1 for the safety <b>check</b> <b>flood</b> (10, 000 yr-return period).

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to assess the status and trend of deforestation in the Shiwalik region of the central Nepal, and to explore the most significant effects of community forestry on tree diversity and livelihood of the local community. Two sites, heavily deforested in the past and one being presently owned by the government, the other managed by the local community for about 15 years, were compared with respect to tree and tree seedlings diversity and livelihood capitals. To analyze the diversity indices Hill’s diversity numbers, Shannon’s index and Importance value percentage were measured, whereas livelihood parameters were compared using the livelihood capitals model. The participatory approach was adopted to collect socio-economic data of the study sites. Community forestry helped increase the number of tree species as well as individuals. However, the study failed to state that the protection of forest from deforestation {{for a short period of}} time changed the diversity indices. Nevertheless, by protection the trend of an increased number of tree species coming as seedlings was obvious. Hence, the hypothesis that deforestation changes the tree diversity was proved. The study revealed that community forestry increased tree and wild animals, decreased soil erosion and <b>checked</b> the <b>flooding</b> in gullies and flow of debris. In the Government owned forest, soil erosion was rampant and had led to the decrease in agriculture productivity of the study area. The study also supported the fact that the protection of forest from deforestation by local people positively increased the majority of livelihood parameters.

40|$|Mahanadi is an {{important}} river in India. At its delta head at Mundali, it has branched into several rivers and drains its water to the Bay of Bengal. The deltaic region is affected by flood, drainage and salinity problems almost every year due to presence of low level escapes [...] These escapes start functioning with a flood of 17000 cumecs of undivided flood in Mahanadi at Naraj. Some part of the deltaic region is safe up to a flood of 28300 cumecs due to presence of double continuos embankments.

40|$|Description of the {{problems}} Throughout history floods {{have been one of}} the most severe natural catastrophes, which brought about loss of lives and huge economic losses in addition to the influence on community activities and adverse effects on the environment. We have witnessed enormous flood events almost all over the world, even in the early years of 21 st century. The cruel lesson learnt is that we have not coped well with floods. Studying the risk of flooding is the goal of this thesis. The focus is given to flooding of urban drainage systems. Urban climate, human activities and land use vary quickly and greatly with time. These variations modify the features of both urban hydrology and hydraulics, and change the distribution of water. It may lead to dual adverse effects in one region: the severe water shortage in one period and the increasing risk of flooding in another period. Therefore, finding appropriate solutions for these problems has been being a great challenge for the whole world. - Aims of this study This study aims to contribute ideal approaches and models to understand deeply urban flooding problems, i. e. to find the causes of flooding, to analyze their propagations and on this basis to evaluate the risk of flooding, and finally to search for solutions for flood mitigation. - Study contents and methodologies Distinguishing the potential hazards of urban flooding, delineating the changes of urban lands, developing models to simulate flooding and examining different measures to mitigate the risk of flooding constitute the main contents of this study. It is carried out by both qualitative analysis and quantitative simulations in a stepwise manner. Regarding the stochastic characteristics of flooding, a risk analysis initiates the study, which aims to formulate flooding scenarios in general urban environment through procedures of system definition, hazard identification, causal analysis, frequency analysis, consequence estimation and mitigation. A Norwegian case study illustrates the whole process. Following the risk analysis, GIS technology is introduced to delineate the variation of topography. GIS hydrological modeling is applied to delineate the basic hydrological elements from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The accuracy of grid DEM and the influence of buildings are studied. Two urban flooding models, the "basin" model and the dual drainage model, are developed on the basis of the MOUSE program (DHI, 2000). The three models, i. e. the MOUSE model, the “basin” model and the dual drainage model, are examined through two case studies, and the flow capacities of the existing sewers in these two case studies are then <b>checked.</b> Following the <b>flooding</b> simulation, the effectiveness of four flooding mitigation measures is tested. - Main results Sixty-eight (68) potential flooding hazards are identified by risk analysis in Chapter three. In combination with Trondheim case study, the frequencies of several flooding scenarios are studied, and it is indicated that the flooding of urban drainage systems happens more frequently than river flooding. When it happens, urban flooding disturbs very much the activities in flooding areas. Therefore management attentions should be paid to urban flooding in addition to large river flooding. GIS is used as a bridge between digital data and numerical flooding simulation. Two important hydrological elements, watersheds and surface stream networks, are derived from grid DEM in Chapter four. The preliminary flood risk zones are delineated in combination with two case studies. They provide useful information for flood management. The three flooding models are calibrated through two case studies: Trondheim- Fredlybekken catchment in Norway and Beijing-Baiwanzhuang (BWZ) catchment in China. <b>Flooding</b> <b>checking</b> of the existing sewer systems in these two case studies indicates that the current flow capacities of sewers are less than the designed capacities. Consequently, flood mitigation measures are examined in the following Chapter six. The study indicates that the combination of structural and non-structural flood mitigation measures are regarded as the comprehensive solution for flood control. - Restrictions of the developed models The developed flood models are restricted to summer and autumn flooding situations. In other words, the snowmelt routine is not included in the hydrological model applied. However, if a hydrological model that is able to simulate snowmelt could be connected to the developed models, then the hydraulic analysis would be carried out similarly. </p...|$|R
40|$|Nearly {{one million}} Australian adults are not {{enrolled}} to vote. PETER BRENT and BRIAN COSTAR {{look at why}} IN MODERN democracies like Australia’s {{it is essential that}} the maximum possible number of people vote at elections. To help achieve this, we have had compulsory enrolment since 1911 and compulsory voting since 1924. The latter certainly works - we can confidently predict that around 93 per cent of electors will turn out to vote on 24 November. What is less certain is how many eligible citizens are not on the roll and therefore cannot and will not vote. Official figures suggest that 93 per cent of citizens living in Australia are enrolled. This is impressive by world standards, but its flip side is that nearly one million citizens are not enrolled to vote. Of equal concern are the estimated one million Australians living overseas. Just before the 2004 election only 16, 193 of that one million were enrolled to vote, so the tally of non-enrollees is probably closer to two million or 15 per cent of the current enrolment of 13. 6 million. Why are so many under the enrolment radar? One reason is that while the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is required by law to remove ineligible people from the roll, it is constrained in enrolling the people who are eligible. Australians are a mobile mob. When the AEC discovers, by mining data bases such driver’s license registers, that a person has moved out of their electorate, they remove their name from the electoral roll. In the last six months 143, 000 names have been removed from the roll and we can’t be certain how many of them have re-enrolled. The AEC then writes to the person at their new address inviting them to fill out a new enrolment form. Whether that invitation is accepted is effectively {{in the hands of the}} individual, since it is extremely rare for anyone to be prosecuted for non-enrolment. Over time, then, the roll becomes increasingly inaccurate and, short of a change in the law, there is little the AEC can do about it. Another group which contributes to roll inaccuracy is the young. Only around 80 per cent of Australians aged 18 - 24 are enrolled and the ratio varies greatly from state to state, with Victoria consistently the highest and the Northern Territory the lowest. Worryingly, some young people wrongly believe that when they turn 18 they are automatically entered on the roll. Perhaps they should be. Since early this year the AEC has been conducting $ 15 million media campaign, targeted at getting young people, especially 18 year olds, on the roll. The campaign was hip and slick, but its success was limited. At the 2004 election 18 year olds comprised 1. 43 per cent of the total roll; now they account for 1. 51 per cent. That’s not much bang for a lot of taxpayer bucks. In 1983 the Commonwealth Electoral Act was amended to require a seven day grace period between the calling of the election and the closure of the roll. The thinking was that an election would jog people’s memories about their enrolment status. In 2004, 423, 993 citizens made good their enrolment details in the seven day period, about 78, 000 of whom were new enrollees. Another 115, 000 missed the cut because they tried to enrol after the seven days - so, of course, they could not vote. When it took control of the Senate the Howard government cut the grace period for new enrolments to one working day. It defended the change by saying that the AEC could not properly <b>check</b> the <b>flood</b> of enrolments that came in during the seven days and that this left the door open to roll fraud. Both arguments were spurious and the level of mendacity employed to defend the change suggests that the real motive was politics. Remember, the young strongly support Labor and the Greens rather than the Coalition. Remarkably and inexplicably, when the prime minister announced the date for this election date, the writ was not issued, as expected, on the next day but on the following Wednesday. This kept the roll open for three days during which 77, 000 enrolment additions were processed. We don’t yet know how many of these were new. Given the earlier grandstanding about roll fraud, why did the government do this? Could it be that it doubted the constitutionality of excluding voters from the roll in the wake of the High Court’s recent decision that invalidated the Coalition’s decision to deny all convicted prisoners the vote? Or was it because, despite the $ 15 million advertising campaign, the enrolment rates of the young were still so low as to be politically embarrassing? We will probably never know. • Peter Brent is a researcher at the Australian National University.
