5|$|The BT46 was an {{aluminium}} alloy monocoque featuring the trapezoidal cross section common {{to many of}} Gordon Murray’s 1970s designs. It featured inbuilt pneumatic jacks fed from an external supply of compressed air to lift it off the ground for tyre changes during practice. It employed a very early version of the carbon brakes that were in universal use by the mid-1980s—a concept taken from the aircraft industry. The system, which Brabham had been developing since 1976, combined <b>carbon</b> <b>composite</b> brake pads with a steel disc faced with <b>carbon</b> <b>composite</b> 'pucks'.|$|E
25|$|The {{redesigned}} 747-400 interior features new cabin sidewalls, heat-resistant phenolic glass, <b>carbon</b> <b>composite</b> paneling, {{and larger}} storage bins. An enhanced in-flight entertainment framework, called the Advanced Cabin Entertainment/Service System (ACESS), debuted on 747-400, which integrates 18-channel audio capability, four passenger intercom announcement zones, inter-cabin telephones, and passenger lighting into a central system. An eight-bunk overhead crew rest is installed above the aft cabin, while a second crew rest area {{is located on}} the upper deck behind the cockpit for flight crew use.|$|E

25|$|On September 15, 2012, the NTSB {{requested}} the grounding of certain 787s due to GE engine failures; GE believed the production problem had been fixed by that time. In March 2014, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries informed Boeing {{of a new}} problem that {{was caused by a}} change in manufacturing processes. Employees did not fill gaps with shims to connect wing rib aluminum shear ties to the <b>carbon</b> <b>composite</b> wing panels; the tightened fasteners, without shims, cause excessive stress that creates hairline cracks in the wings, which could enlarge and cause further damage. Forty-two aircraft awaiting delivery were affected, and each one required 1–2 weeks to inspect and repair. However, Boeing did not expect this problem to affect the overall delivery schedule, even if some airplanes were delivered late.|$|E
25|$|The revised GT-R {{features}} an engine with revised mapping, changes to valve timing, larger inlets and a revised exhaust system which boosts rated power to 545bhp and 612Nm of torque from 3200 to 6000rpm. Changes {{also include a}} new more rigid front strut bar made from <b>carbon</b> <b>composite,</b> larger front brake rotors, new lighter and stiffer wheels, and revised Dunlop tires. Cosmetic changes include a new front bumper with integrated LEDs. The front bumper improves cooling to the radiator and front brakes while reducing drag. A new rear diffuser improves downforce and also includes additional rear cooling ducts. The interior was revised to improve the quality. This new version is offered with a new HDD CARWINGS navigation system with enhanced entertainment {{features an}}d USB port with iPod connectivity. The revised GT-R went on sale in Japan from mid November 2010 and February 2011 in Europe, North America and other regions.|$|E
500|$|For the 1981 season, a BT49C {{specification}} {{was produced}} with a chassis lightened through {{increased use of}} <b>carbon</b> <b>composite</b> materials. Five of this variant were built {{and two of the}} previous year's cars converted to this specification. That year a minimum ride height of [...] was introduced and sliding skirts were banned, with the intention of limiting ground effect and slowing the cars. The BT49C regained its front wings to compensate in part for the downforce lost. More significantly, Murray devised a hydropneumatic suspension system for the BT49C in which soft air springs supported the car at the regulation height for checks while stationary. At speed, where the ride height could not be measured, downforce compressed the air and the car settled to a much lower height, creating more downforce. Because the skirts now had to be fixed, the suspension had to be very stiff to allow them to consistently seal around the sides of the car: {{by the end of the}} 1981 season, total suspension movement was only , half of which came from the compression of the tyres. A lightweight qualifying chassis was produced, featuring a small fuel tank and lighter reinforced carbon-carbon brake discs and pads.|$|E

2500|$|As a clean-sheet design, the SH09 adopted several modern features, {{including}} an airframe that is entirely composed of <b>carbon</b> <b>composite</b> materials, a shrouded fenestron tail rotor, and a high-visibility cockpit. The use of carbon composites {{is a key}} feature of the aircraft, which has been credited with enabling the high volume cabin to be adopted without incurring too much weight; according to Mathias Senes, Marenco's chief commercial officer: [...] "There’s no other material today that brings the benefits of rigidity, strength, and light weight". According to Stucki, the rotorcraft is designed around the perspective of pilots and this has driven many design attributes, principally those involving the cabin, to improve ergonomics, comfort, and operator requirements overall. In terms of flying capabilities, it possesses excellent hot and high performance, lengthy flight endurance, a low noise signature, and has relatively smooth handling.|$|E

2500|$|Columbia was {{destroyed}} at about 09:00 EST on February 1, 2003 while re-entering the atmosphere after a 16-day scientific mission. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board {{determined that a}} hole was punctured in the leading edge on one of Columbia's wings, made of a <b>carbon</b> <b>composite.</b> The hole had formed when a piece of insulating foam from the external fuel tank peeled off during the launch 16 days earlier and struck the shuttle's left wing. During the intense heat of re-entry, hot gases penetrated {{the interior of the}} wing, likely compromising the hydraulic system and leading to control failure of the control surfaces. [...] The resulting loss of control exposed minimally protected areas of the orbiter to full-entry heating and dynamic pressures that eventually led to vehicle break up. [...] The nearly 84,000 pieces of collected debris of the vessel are stored in a 16th floor office suite in the Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center.
