40|$|The Miocene to Pleistocene Limon Group of Costa Rica {{is a mixed}} carbonate-siliciclastic {{succession}} {{that formed}} {{in association with the}} emergence of the Central American Isthmus. Our study focuses on a lower Late Pliocene reef unit, the newly excavated <b>Contact</b> <b>Cut,</b> which is located at the contact between the siliciclastic sediments of the Rio Banano Formation and the mixed reefal and coral bearing deposits and siliciclastic sediments of the Quebrada Chocolate Formation. The siliciclastic sediments were deposited in a thick, deltaic setting sourced by erosion of the Cordillera de Talamanca. Deposits of the Limon Group preserve a sequence of progressively shallowing, near-shore sediments that were exposed by uplift during the early to middle Pleistocene. The <b>Contact</b> <b>Cut</b> outcrop shows the first reef sequence in the stratigraphic sequence and thus illustrates the reestablishment of Caribbean coral reef predominance in the Neogene. It shows extensive reef growth during a rise in sea level and a slight progradation during the succeeding sea-level highstand. Three stages of reef evolution are recognized based on faunal diversity. The <b>Contact</b> <b>Cut</b> reef complex is comparable to the time equivalent reef of the Las Islas roadcut, situated west of Limon, which shows a rapid burial of the corals by siliciclastics. Both reefs document a distinct facies diversification during the final stages of the closing of the Central American Seaway. The reefs developed in an environment stressed by siliciclastic input, which ultimately caused a decrease in coral diversity and abundance followed by a temporary demise of the reefs. The biotic composition of the patch reefs that occurred during the sea-level rise, Las Islas and <b>Contact</b> <b>Cut,</b> did not differ from the reefs that developed during the final highstand in sea level, the reefs of the overlying Moin formation (Limon Group). Differences in the position on the shelf relative to the source of the siliciclastics might have been the cause for the different response to the rise in sea level of the transgressive reefs, with a very fast give up scenario for Las Islas reef and a catch up followed by a give up phase for <b>Contact</b> <b>Cut</b> reef. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|Optical double {{patterning}} allows for increased quality control over varying film stacks {{as well as}} allowing photolithography equipment to image smaller dense features. This is done by splitting dense patterns into two separate masks. A <b>contact</b> <b>cut</b> layer {{double patterning}} process was developed, and proved to be successful down to contact density of 4 μm CD by 4 μm density (4 x 4 μm CD x Density). Conventional dark field double patterning processes use two separate substrate etch steps (one etch step after each pass of lithography). This project developed a dark field double patterning process which incorporated light field double patterning techniques, which in effect eliminated one of the substrate etch steps by thermally curing the first pass of photoresist. Thermal cure temperatures of first pass resist were varied from 125 °C to 200 °C, finding that temperatures less than 175 °C did not sufficiently cross-link the resist enough {{to stand up to}} the second pass of lithography, resulting in loss of first resist patterns. Temperatures greater than 175 °C caused the first pass lithography to flow, resulting in the elimination/minimizing of <b>contact</b> <b>cut</b> feature densities less than 4 x 4 μm. A successful <b>contact</b> <b>cut</b> (dark field) double patterning process was developed; however feature densities were limited due to the incorporation of light field double patterning techniques...|$|E

Developing a component for {{the case of a}} <b>contact</b> wire <b>cut</b> to prevent further damage from the overhead contact line system requires an extensive knowledge about the system behaviour. Therefore, a comprehensive multi body system model (MBS) is developed in Matlab SimMechanics environment. In order to validate the datas generated from the simulations, a contact wire test stand has been constructed where cutting experiments can be run by releasing a pretensioned wire.

40|$|The 2012 Lowy Institute Poll {{reports the}} results of a nationally {{representative}} opinion survey of 1, 005 Australian adults conducted in Australia between 26 March and 10 April 2012 using mobile and landline telephones. It also reports {{the results of}} a parallel survey conducted in New Zealand by the Asia New Zealand Foundation. Executive Summary Foreign investment in Australian farms Foreign ownership of farmland looks set to continue as a hot political issue, with a large majority (81 %) of Australians against the Australian government allowing foreign companies to buy Australian farmland to grow crops or farm livestock, with 63 % saying they are strongly against. Uranium sales to India The Labor Party recently overturned its ban on the sale of uranium to India, but 61 % of Australians say they are against Australia selling uranium to India, with 39 % strongly against. Among Australians who say they always vote Labor, two-thirds (65 %) are against it. Relations with Fiji Australia’s Fiji policy – that saw ministerial-level <b>contact</b> <b>cut</b> off in response to its military coup – is at odds with public wishes: a large majority (79 %) are in favour of the Australian government restarting ministerial-level contacts. Bali bombings Almost a decade after the 2002 Bali bombings killed 202 people including 88 Australians, only 11 % of Australians say the bombers have been fully brought to justice, with most (61 %) saying they have only partly been brought to justice. Twenty-two per cent say they have not been brought to justice at all. Climate change There was bad news for the government on climate change policy. The majority (63 %) of Australians say they are against the government’s legislation introducing a fixed price on carbon that will then lead to an Emissions Trading Scheme, with a high proportion (45 %) strongly against. However, a third (33 %) of the population oppose the legislation and agree the measures are not strict enough to result in substantial emissions reductions. A majority of Australians (57 %) are in favour of a future Coalition government removing the Emissions Trading Scheme. A tracking question that presents Australians with three options for dealing with global warming reveals {{for the first time that}} those favouring an intermediate approach to the problem now outnumber Australians favouring the most aggressive form of action. War in Afghanistan Support for the war in Afghanistan has hit a record low, with just 33 % of Australians saying Australia should continue to be involved militarily in Afghanistan, down seven points since last year. However, 55 % are in favour of Australian Special Forces staying on in Afghanistan to work alongside US Special Forces in more limited counter-terrorism operations after major combat operations are scheduled to end. Migration Presented with six hypothetical criteria for determining which migrants should be allowed to come to Australia, those ranked as the most important are: having similar values to Australians (34 %), work skills (23 %), English-language skills (20 %), education (11 %), religion (8 %) and race (4 %). US Presidential elections Obamamania continues, with Australians preferring Barack Obama to his Republican rival Mitt Romney to become the next President of the United States by an 8 to 1 ratio (80 % compared with 9 %). US military bases After the November 2011 announcement that US Marines would be deployed to Australia, 74 % of Australians say that they are in favour of up to 2, 500 US soldiers being based in Darwin. Forty-six per cent are also in favour of allowing more than 2, 500 soldiers to be based in Australia, and, if either China or Indonesia objected, support for increasing the number actually increased to 51 % in the case of China and 54 % in the case of Indonesia. Avoiding recession The government has struggled to sell its success helping Australia avoid recession, with 70 % of Australians saying a major reason Australia managed to avoid falling into recession is demand for Australian resources from countries like China, compared with just 41 % who say a major reason is good Australian government policies. Democracy Some Australians appear blasé about democracy. Just 60 % of Australians say democracy is preferable to any other kind of government, and only 39 % of 18 to 29 year olds. A quarter (23 %) of Australians say that in some circumstances, a non-democratic government can be preferable, and 15 % that for someone like me, it doesn’t matter what kind of government we have...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCurrent {{processes}} for producing transmission gears involve hobbing, milling or shaping of a forged stock {{to obtain the}} gear shape. Gears are typically formed by hobbing tools made from solid tooling material, such as tungsten carbide, and have dozens of teeth. The gear hobbing process entails several teeth in cut simultaneously. Generation of in-volute tooth profiles results in varying chip loads from pass to pass. In this paper, details are provided for a finite element-based model of gear hobbing and milling processes. The model explicitly meshes gear cutter geometries with dozens of teeth. These cutters are used to simulate the complicated kinematic motion between tool and workpiece. Thermo-mechanical coupled calculations within an explicit dynamic formulation are per-formed on the tool and workpiece during chip removal. The complex geometry of involute tooth profiles results in complicated contact scenarios on the evolving workpiece geometry during tooth profile generation. Tooth-workpiece-chip contact is enforced rigorously and is particularly complicated with the confined space of gear hobbing. Advanced adaptive meshing strategies are developed and employed to maintain {{the resolution of the}} tool-workpiece interaction while multiple teeth are in <b>contact.</b> <b>Cutting</b> forces, temperatures and stresses in the tool and workpiece are predicted for steel workpiece materials. Models are validated through a set of initially simplified experiments where incremental complexity is added, allowing for direct comparison between predicted and measured forces and chip shapes...|$|R
