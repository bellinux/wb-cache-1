5|$|Several anecdotal stories {{supposedly}} {{explain why}} Warhol chose Campbell's Soup cans as {{the focal point}} of his pop art. One reason is that he needed a new subject after he abandoned comic strips, a move taken in part due to his respect for the refined work of Roy Lichtenstein. According to Ted Carey—one of Warhol's commercial art assistants in the late 1950s—it was Muriel Latow who suggested the idea for both the soup <b>cans</b> <b>and</b> Warhol's early U.S. dollar paintings.|$|E

5|$|The 20th century saw an {{increase}} in worldwide lead exposure levels due to the increased widespread use of the metal. Beginning in the 1920s, lead was added to gasoline to improve its combustion; lead from this exhaust persists today in soil and dust in buildings. Blood lead levels worldwide have been declining sharply since the 1980s, when leaded gasoline began to be phased out. In those countries that have banned lead in solder for food and drink <b>cans</b> <b>and</b> have banned leaded gasoline additives, blood lead levels have fallen sharply since the mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|Beer is {{distributed}} in bottles and <b>cans</b> <b>and</b> is also commonly available on draught, particularly in pubs and bars. The brewing {{industry is a}} global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. The strength of modern beer is usually around 4% to 6% alcohol by volume (abv), although it may vary between 0.5% and 20%, with some breweries creating examples of 40% abv and above. Beer forms {{part of the culture}} of many nations and is associated with social traditions such as beer festivals as well as a rich pub culture involving activities like pub crawling and pub games such as bar billiards.|$|E
5|$|Flanders {{began writing}} {{early in his}} career. His {{published}} articles on machine tool technology led to {{a job as an}} editor of Machine magazine in New York City. This job, which he held between 1905 and 1910, required him to cover developments in the machine tool industry. He traveled widely to visit the companies that he wrote about, which provided him many valuable contacts with leaders in the industry. As editor, he wrote articles on gear tooth systems, gear cutting machinery, hobs, the manufacture of <b>cans,</b> <b>and</b> of motor cars, including Machinery’s reference series on the subject.|$|E

5|$|Bismuth was {{purchased}} from the American Smelting and Refining Company {{of the highest}} purity that it could produce. It was sent to Hanford, where it was put in aluminum <b>cans,</b> <b>and</b> placed inside a reactor for 100 days. The canned slugs then shipped to Unit IV, where they were bathed in hydrochloric acid, which dissolved the aluminum. This formed an aluminum chloride solution that was disposed of, as it was highly radioactive due to iron and copper in the aluminum alloy. The bismuth slugs were then dissolved in aqua regia. This was too weak for electroplating the polonium, so the nitric acid was removed, and then the polonium deposited on bismuth by adding powdered bismuth. This resulted in a 100–1 concentration. This could then be repeated by dissolving in aqua regia again to achieve a 1000–1 concentration. This was again dissolved, and the polonium electroplated on platinum foils. The main problem with the process was that it required glass-lined containers due to the aqua regia, and mechanisms for safe handling of the radioactive material. The Dayton Project explored alternative purification methods that {{were found to be}} workable, but less efficient or safe.|$|E
5|$|They {{arrived at}} the Andrew Johnson Hotel in Knoxville, Tennessee, where Carr {{requested}} a doctor for Williams, as he was feeling {{the combination of the}} chloral hydrate and alcohol he had drunk on the way from Montgomery to Knoxville. Dr. P.H. Cardwell injected Williams with two shots of vitamin B12 that also contained a quarter-grain of morphine. Carr and Williams checked out of the hotel; the porters had to carry Williams to the car, as he was coughing and hiccuping. At around midnight on Thursday January 1, 1953, when they crossed the Tennessee state line and arrived in Bristol, Virginia, Carr stopped at a small all-night restaurant and asked Williams if he wanted to eat. Williams said he did not, and those are believed to be his last words. Carr later drove on until he stopped for fuel at a gas station in Oak Hill, West Virginia, where he realized that Williams was dead. The filling station's owner called the chief of the local police. In Williams' Cadillac the police found some empty beer <b>cans</b> <b>and</b> unfinished handwritten lyrics.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{the video}} {{distribution}} company The Criterion Collection, {{in collaboration with}} the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ Film Archive, began the restoration of the original negatives of the Apu trilogy, including Pather Panchali. These negatives had been severely damaged by a fire in London in 1993, and all film <b>cans</b> <b>and</b> fragments belonging to the Ray films were sent to the Motion Picture Academy for storage, where they lay unseen for two decades. It was discovered upon reexamination that, although many parts of the films were indeed destroyed by fire or the effects of age, other parts were salvageable. The materials were shipped to a restoration laboratory in Bologna, Italy: L’Immagine Ritrovata. Over a thousand hours of labor by hand were expended in restoring and scanning the negatives and, in the end, about 40 percent of the Pather Panchali negative was restored. (For those parts of the negative that were missing or unusable, duplicate negatives and fine-grain masters from various commercial or archival sources were used.) The Criterion Collection’s own lab then spent six months creating the digital version of all three films, at times choosing to preserve the distinctive look of the films even at the cost of retaining some imperfections.|$|E
