There is also a requirement for healthcare providers to demonstrate that their procedures fulfil the conditions <b>of</b> lawful data <b>processing</b> required by the GDPR, e.g. on the basis of explicit consent of the data subject, or the use <b>of</b> safeguards when <b>processing</b> data for research or public health purposes.|$|R
