50|$|Pristipomoides filamentosus, {{commonly}} known as the crimson jobfish, <b>crimson</b> <b>snapper,</b> opakapaka, or Hawaiian pink snapper, is a species of snapper native to the Indian Ocean and into the Pacific Ocean as far east as Hawaii and Tahiti. They inhabit waters over rocky substrates at depths from 40 to 400 m seemingly preferring to remain between 180 and 270 m. This species can reach a length of 100 cm, though most are around 50 cm. The greatest known weight for this species is 8.2 kg. This species is very important to local commercial fisheries and is sought out as a game fish.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{morphology}} {{observation and}} illumina sequencing {{were performed on}} two different coloration skins of <b>crimson</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus erythropterus), the black zone and the red zone. Three types of chromatophores, melanophores, iridophores and xanthophores, were organized in the skins. The main {{differences between the two}} colorations were in the amount and distribution of the three chromatophores. After comparing the two transcriptomes, 9200 unigenes with significantly different expressions (ratio change ≥ 2 and q-value ≤ 0. 05) were found, of which 5972 were up-regulated in black skin and 3228 were up-regulated in red skin. Through the function annotation, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of the differentially transcribed genes, we excavated a number of uncharacterized candidate pigment genes as well as found the conserved genes affecting pigmentation in <b>crimson</b> <b>snapper.</b> The patterns of expression of 14 pigment genes were confirmed by the Quantitative real-time PCR analysis between the two color skins. Overall, this study shows a global survey of the morphological characters and transcriptome analysis of the different coloration skins in <b>crimson</b> <b>snapper,</b> and provides valuable cellular and genetic information to uncover the mechanism of the formation of pigment patterns in snappers...|$|E

40|$|<b>Crimson</b> <b>Snapper</b> is a {{widespread}} Indo–Pacific species found throughout tropical Australian waters. Research on the biological stock structure of this species has only occurred in northern Australian waters, including the Timor Sea, the Arafura Sea and the Gulf of Carpentaria 1. A single genetic stock was found across this region. It is believed that the species has a similar biological stock structure to Saddletail Snapper (Lutjanus malibaricus) —that is, a North West Shelf biological stock and a biological stock off {{the east coast of}} Queensland, in addition to the northern Australian biological stock...|$|E
40|$|Extract] Experiments were {{conducted}} in northern, central and southern Queensland to investigate the effects of hook design and size on the incidence of hooking injury, {{and the effects of}} a number of factors, including barotrauma-treatment method, on post-release survival rates of a suite of key reef-associated demersal fish species of particular importance to Queensland's reef line fishery. The key species examined were common coral trout (Plectropomus leopardus), redthroat emperor (Lethrinus miniatus), <b>crimson</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus erythropterus), saddletail snapper (Lutjanus malabaricus), red emperor (Lutjanus sebae) and spangled emperor (Lethrinus nebulosus) ...|$|E
40|$|Common coral trout, Plectropomus leopardus Lacepede, <b>crimson</b> <b>snapper,</b> Lutjanus erythropterus Bloch, saddletail snapper, Lutjanus malabaricus (Bloch & Schneider), red emperor, Lutjanus sebae (Cuvier), redthroat emperor, Lethrinus miniatus (Schneider) {{and grass}} emperor, Lethrinus laticaudis Alleyne & Macleay, were tagged to {{determine}} the effects of barotrauma relief procedures (weighted shot-line release and venting using a hollow needle) and other factors on survival. Release condition was the most significant factor affecting the subsequent recapture rate of all species. Capture depth was significant in all species apart from L. malabaricus and L. miniatus, the general trend being reduced recapture probability with increasing capture depth. Recapture rates of fish hooked in either the lip or mouth were generally significantly higher than for those hooked in the throat or gut. Statistically significant benefit from treating fish for barotrauma was found in only L. malabaricus, but the lack of any negative effects of treating fish indicated that the practices of venting and shot-lining should not be discouraged by fisheries managers for these species...|$|E
40|$|The Gulf of Carpentaria Finfish Trawl Fishery {{operates}} under developmental {{permits and}} harvests five main tropical snapper species. The fishery operates in eastern Gulf of Carpentaria waters and is managed by Fisheries Queensland {{on behalf of}} the Queensland Fishery Joint Authority. For the years 2004 – 2014, the fishery Total Allowable Commercial Catch (TACC) was fixed at 1250 t and substantially under-filled. In 2011 new stock analyses were published for the fishery. Results were presented to industry including the estimated equilibrium maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of 450 t for east Gulf of Carpentaria waters. The MSY value represented the maximum average combined species harvest that can be taken long-term; combining MSY harvests of the five main species. For the 2015 calendar year, a revised 450 t harvest quota was set for <b>Crimson</b> <b>Snapper,</b> Saddletail Snapper, Red Emperor and other Emperor species; plus a tonnage allowance for other permitted species. The revised quota tonnage represented a considerable reduction from the 1250 t set in previous years. Industry raised questions about not understanding how the MSY was arrived at and why it was less than early 1990 s yield estimates. The purpose of this report is to explain the MSY estimates for east Gulf of Carpentaria waters. The 450 t MSY represents at present the best estimate available and is consistent with pre- 2011 estimates...|$|E
40|$|The {{population}} genetic {{structure of}} the <b>crimson</b> <b>snapper</b> Lutjanus erythropterus in East Asia was examined with a 427 -bp hypervariable portion of the mtDNA control region. A total of 262 samples were collected and 75 haplotypes were obtained. Neutrality tests (Tajima's and Fu's) suggested that Lutjanus erythropterus in East Asia had experienced a bottleneck followed by population expansion since the late Pleistocene. Despite the low phylogeographic structures in mtDNA haplotypes, a hierarchical examination of populations in 11 localities from four geographical regions using analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated significant genetic differentiation among regions (Phi(CT) = 0. 08564, p < 0. 01). Limited gene flow between the eastern region (including a locality in the western Pacific Ocean and two localities in the East Sea) and three geographic regions of the South China Sea largely contributed to the genetic subdivision. However, comparisons among three geographic regions of the South China Sea showed little to no genetic difference. Populations of Lutjanus erythropterus in East Asia are inferred to {{be divided into two}} major groups: an eastern group, including populations of the western Pacific Ocean and the East Sea, and a South China Sea group, consisting of populations from northern Malaysia to South China. The results suggest that fishery management should reflect the genetic differentiation and diversity in East Asia. (c) 2006 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the prevalence, phylogenetics and DNA barcoding of Zeylanicobdella arugamensis (Z.  arugamensis) from <b>crimson</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus erythropterus), Jerejak Island, Penang, Malaysia. Methods: Experiment {{was conducted with}} 200 fish specimens of cultured Lutjanus erythropterus from Jerejak Island, Penang, Peninsular Malaysia. The water temperature and length for each fish were measured prior to parasites examination. Next, the morphological identification of parasites was performed. Genomic DNA from parasites was extracted for further molecular analysis. After PCR amplification, phylogenetic tree was constructed. The lowest Bayesian information criterion scores showed that the most compatible model is Tajima and Nei. Finally, data sets of cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene sequence and trace file have been submitted to Barcode of Life Data System. Results: The prevalence rate of Z.  arugamensis was recorded to be 11. 5 %, and the intensity was 1. 48. The low intensity {{was due to the}} water temperature recorded in this study (32. 9 – 33. 2  °C). All the individuals of Z.  arugamensis recorded in this study showed a close relationship with species that were recorded in NCBI database (Z.  arugamensis DQ 414344, Aestabdella leiostomi DQ 414305, Pterobdella amara DQ 414334 and Cystobranchus meyeri DQ 414315) but less relationship with Aestabdella abditovesiculata DQ 414300. Finally, the DNA sequences submitted to Barcode of Life Data System in accordance to species have already obtained Barcode Index Number as BOLD: ACM 3477. Conclusions: This study has provided an overview of sequence divergence at cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene, DNA barcodes and parasite prevalence of Z.  arugamensis...|$|E
