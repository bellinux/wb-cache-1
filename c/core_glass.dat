50|$|All {{optical fibers}} undergo some darkening {{depending}} {{on a number}} of factors that include: ionization type, optical fiber <b>core</b> <b>glass</b> composition, operating wavelength, dose rate, total accumulated dose, temperature and power propagating through the core. Since attenuation is composition dependent, it is observed that fibers having pure silica cores and fluorine down doped claddings are amongst the most radiation hard fibers. The presence of dopants in the core such as germanium, phosphorus, boron, aluminum, erbium, ytterbium, thulium, holmium etc. compromises the radiation hardness of optical fibers. To minimize damage consequences, it is better to use a pure silica core fiber at higher operating wavelength, lower dose rate, lower total accumulated dose, higher temperature (accelerated recovery) and higher signal power (photo-bleaching). In addition to these intrinsic steps, external engineering may be required to shield the fiber from the effects of radiation.|$|E

The article {{brings into}} focus {{the present state}} of {{technology}} employing active fibres doped with rare earth (RE) ions for applications requiring power supply of several dozen watts and broadband ASE sources. Current trends in development of glasses and in construction of active fibres used in fibre sources of radiation within VIS-NIR range are presented. Technological constraints in the doping of fibre <b>core</b> <b>glasses</b> are discussed, with particular consideration of optimal RE concentration for technical applications. Characteristics of glasses are offered, and the glasses are used for manufacturing optical fibres with luminescence within the visible as well as near- and mid-infrared ranges. Also, requirements and luminescence properties concerning glasses co-doped with e. g. Nd 3 +/Yb 3 +,Tm 3 +/Ho 3 + and Yb 3 +/Tb 3 + are discussed. Results of research on the impact of technological parameters of glass matrices on luminescence properties of <b>core</b> <b>glasses</b> and optical fibres are quoted. For the doped glasses of which luminescence in a wide spectral range is desired, conditions for their processing into optical fibre systems are mentioned. Additionally, the impact of phonon energy in the glass on producing emission in a specified spectral range is analyzed. Furthermore, the article presents directions of technological studies to solve problems persisting in the phase of glass matrix design, as well as in determining the influence of fibre drawing process on the luminescence properties of <b>core</b> <b>glasses</b> and optical fibres, confirming the differences in luminescence stemming from the drawing process.
