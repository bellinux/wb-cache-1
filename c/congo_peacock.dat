5000|$|Very {{little is}} known about this species. It was only {{recorded}} as a species in 1936 by Dr. James Chapin after his failed search for the elusive okapi. Dr. Chapin noticed that the native Congolese headdresses contained long reddish-brown feathers that he couldn't identify with any previously known species of bird. Later, Chapin visited the Royal Museum of Central Africa and saw two stuffed specimens with similar feathers labeled as the 'Indian peacock' which he later discovered to be the <b>Congo</b> <b>peacock,</b> a completely different species. In 1955 Chapin managed to find seven specimens of the species [...] The <b>Congo</b> <b>peacock</b> has physical characteristics of both the peafowl and the guineafowl, which may indicate that the <b>Congo</b> <b>peacock</b> is a link between the two families.|$|E
50|$|Animals in {{the park}} include bonobos, Dryas monkeys, Thollon's red colobus, <b>Congo</b> <b>peacock,</b> leopards, forest elephants, and African slender-snouted crocodiles.|$|E
50|$|Pavo is a genus of {{two species}} in the {{pheasant}} family. The two species, along with the <b>Congo</b> <b>peacock,</b> are known as peafowl.|$|E
50|$|The plant {{complex for}} African {{ungulates}} {{which includes the}} giraffe house, was opened 1980th Today there live zebras, giraffes, kudus, okapi, Dorcas gazelle, Marabou stork and Somali wild ass. Wilhelma has been very successful in the breeding of giraffes, Somali wild asses, bongos, okapi, bontebok and zebras. Since 1989, a total of 12 okapi have arrived at Wilhelma. In the giraffe house there are not only the indoor enclosure of giraffe and okapi, but also the home of <b>Congo</b> <b>peacocks,</b> Fennec foxes, short-eared elephant shrews and weaver birds. Former residents include Grant's zebras, shoebills, porcupines, klipspringers, waterbucks, warthogs and numerous antelopes.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Congo</b> <b>peacock</b> male {{does not}} display his covert {{feathers}}, but uses his actual tail feathers during courtship displays. These feathers are much shorter {{than those of}} the Indian and green species, and the ocelli are much less pronounced. Females of the Indian and African species are dull grey and/or brown.|$|E
50|$|Phasianidae {{is mostly}} an Old World family, with a {{distribution}} that includes most of Europe and Asia (except the far north), all of Africa except the driest deserts {{and down into}} much of eastern Australia and (formerly) New Zealand. Meleagridinae (turkeys) are native to the New World, while Tetraoninae (grouse) are circumpolar. The greatest diversity of species is in Southeast Asia and Africa. The <b>Congo</b> <b>peacock</b> is specific to the African Congo. The subfamily Perdicinae has a much more widespread distribution. Within their range they occupy almost every available habitat except for the boreal forests and tundra.|$|E
50|$|After the {{reconnaissance}} surveys, {{in close}} collaboration with traditional authorities and local administrations, the Lukuru team {{focused on the}} areas that still contained a diverse and abundant fauna. In the first year, a monkey was encountered that was eventually determined to be new to science, the lesula (Cercopithecus lomamiensis). They found that TL2 was home to populations of other endemic and endangered species such as Okapi, <b>Congo</b> <b>Peacock,</b> Forest Elephant and significant populations of many non-human primate species including the rare dryas monkey and some other interesting phenotypic varieties of known species. All these findings showed an exceptionally rich and interesting eastern edge to the Congo River's central basin forest block.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{members of}} the Pavo genus, the Congo peafowl are omnivores with a diet {{consisting}} mainly of fruits and insects. In Salonga National Park, its diet is taxonomically narrower in secondary forest than in primary forest. The male has a similar display {{to that of other}} species of peafowl, though the <b>Congo</b> <b>peacock</b> actually fans its tail feathers while other peacocks fan their upper tail covert feathers. The Congo peafowl is monogamous, though detailed mating information from the wild is still needed. The peacock of the species has a high-pitched [...] "gowe" [...] calling noise while the peahen emits a low [...] "gowah". They have loud duets consisting of [...] "rro-ho-ho-o-a" [...] from both sexes.|$|E
5000|$|The book recounts {{two sets}} of journeys: firstly, trips in the 1970s to Senegal, Gambia, and the Ivory Coast (with the {{primatologist}} Gilbert Boese) and secondly a 1986 trip to Gabon and Zaire. In different areas he explored different animals - for example, in Zaire, he was concerned primarily with the <b>Congo</b> <b>peacock.</b> Matthiessen observed that the situation in terms of animal populations and their sustainability was often far worse than anticipated - in certain cases [...] "the animals are so scarce {{that they have no}} reality in daily life." [...] The silence of the title refers to the silences caused by the absence of animals {{on the one hand and}} the growing absence of verdant forest away from the greater and greater proliferation of human urbanisation.|$|E
40|$|Again it was Charles Cordier who secured these birds, {{this time}} for the Royal Zoological Society (Koninklijke Maatschappij voor Dierkunde) at Ant-werpen. In the year 1959 not less than three pairs reached Antwerpen again, {{followed}} by three males and four females in 1960 (12). The Royal Zoological Society at Antwerpen, con-sidering that the first aim should be trying to breed these rare birds in captivity, decided to spread the risks of keeping all the birds in one place. So one pair was send to Mr. Jean Delacours famous park at Cl√®res and one pair to the Royal Zoological Garden at Rotterdam. The birds which were obtained in 1960 partly stayed at Antwerpen, partly went to the other park of the Antwerp Society, Planckendael. A single male at the Zoological Garden Kopenhagen and at the Zoological Garden Frankfort, completed, together with some single males in the United States, the whole stock of <b>Congo</b> <b>Peacock</b> outside Kongo. BREEDING RESULTS WITH <b>CONGO</b> <b>PEACOCK</b> The first results with breeding <b>Congo</b> <b>Peacock</b> in captivity were obtained in Kongo by Mr. T. Herrling 1938. A note on this breeding case, strangely enough a trio in {{which one of the}} hens laid three eggs from which after an incubation period of 26 days one chick hatched, has been given by Chapin (4). This first and only chick died however after four days. The Royal Rotterdam Zoological Garden had the good luck to be the first European Zoo to obtain eggs from the <b>Congo</b> <b>Peacock</b> and to raise the first chick in captivity. Some months later fertile eggs were ob-tained from one pair at Planckendael. After artifici-ally incubating of 8 days, the only egg left was given to a Bantam hen. It developed normally, but un-fortunately was destroyed by unknown cause only a few days before hatching, containing a well devel-oped chick (12). These results proved the possibility to breed and raise <b>Congo</b> <b>Peacock</b> in captivity, not only under tropical conditions {{as in the case of}} Mr. Herrling or under artificially tropical conditions as in Rotter-dam, but also under the conditions of a temperate climate as in Planckendael. THE BREEDING IN ROTTERDAM The breeding pair arrived directly from Kongo at Antwerpen, September 1959. They were brought t...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of the <b>Congo</b> <b>Peacock</b> (Afropavo congensis CHAPIN) {{is one of the}} most recent in ornithology. Certainly it is the most famous one. The history of the discovery has been described by CHAPIN in detail (5, 6). The first living specimens exported from Kongo reached the United States June 1949. CHARLES CORDIER told the story of this remarkable transport and of the painstaking work which he undertook to secure these first specimens (7, 8) ...|$|E
