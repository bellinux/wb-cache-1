40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to {{identify}} variation of the intramuscular fat and connective tissue content in different blade muscles in carcasses characterized by various quality grades. It was found that there is a cumulative impact of muscle and <b>conformation</b> <b>class</b> on intramuscular fat in blade muscle (P = 0. 0330), as well as type of muscle and fat class (P = 0. 0424), but there is no cumulative impact of <b>conformation</b> <b>class</b> and fat class (P = 0. 1788). There is no cumulative influence of muscle type, <b>conformation</b> <b>class,</b> and fat class on amount of connective tissue in blade muscle, but the infraspinatus muscle was characterized by the highest quantity of connective tissue. The differences in the content of intramuscular fat in blade muscles depend on type of muscle as well as fat or <b>conformation</b> <b>class,</b> but there is no cumulative effect of fat and <b>conformation</b> <b>class...</b>|$|R

40|$|The first {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to test the ability of systems of weighing and classifying bovine carcasses used in commercial abattoirs in Ireland to provide information that can be used for the purposes of genetic evaluation of carcass weight, carcass fatness <b>class,</b> and carcass <b>conformation</b> <b>class.</b> Secondly, the study aimed to test whether genetic and phenotypic variances differed by breed of sire. Variance components for carcass traits were estimated for crosses between dairy cows and 8 breeds of sire commonly found in the Irish cattle population. These 8 breeds were Aberdeen Angus, Belgian Blue, Charolais, Friesian, Hereford, Holstein, Limousin, and Simmental. A multivariate animal model was used to estimate genetic parameters within the Holstein sire breed group. Univariate analyses were used to estimate variance components for the remaining 7 sire breed groups. Multivariate sire models were used to formally test differences in genetic variances in sire breed groups. Field data on 64, 443 animals, which were slaughtered in commercial abattoirs between the ages of 300 and 875 d, were analyzed in 8 analyses. Carcass fat <b>class</b> and carcass <b>conformation</b> <b>class</b> were measured using the European Union beef carcass classification system (EUROP) scale. For all 3 traits, the sire breed group with the greatest genetic variance had a value of more than 8 times the sire breed group with least genetic variance. Heritabilities ranged from zero to moderate for carcass fatness class (0. 00 to 0. 40), from low to moderate for carcass <b>conformation</b> <b>class</b> (0. 04 to 0. 36), and from low to high for carcass weight (0. 06 to 0. 65). Carcass weight was the most heritable (0. 26) of the 3 traits. Carcass <b>conformation</b> <b>class</b> and carcass fatness class were equally heritable (0. 17). Genetic and phenotypic correlations were all positive in the Holstein sire breed group. The genetic correlations varied from 0. 11 for the relationship between carcass weight and carcass fatness class to 0. 44 for the relationship between carcass <b>conformation</b> <b>class</b> and carcass fatness class. Carcass weight and classification data collected in Irish abattoirs are useful for the purposes of genetic evaluation for beef traits of Irish cattle. There were significantly different variance components across the sire breed groups...|$|R
