40|$|Abstract. Software metrics-based quality {{classification}} models predict a software module as either fault-prone (fp) or not fault-prone (nfp). Timely application of such models {{can assist in}} directing quality improvement efforts tomodules that are likely tobe fpduringoperations, thereby cost-effectively utilizing the software quality testing and enhancement resources. Since several classification techniques are available, a relative comparative study of some commonly used classification techniques can be useful to practitioners. We present a comprehensive evaluation of the relative performances of seven classification techniques and/or tools. These include logistic regression, case-based reasoning, classification and regression trees (CART), tree-based classification with S-PLUS, and the Sprint-Sliq, C 4. 5, and Treedisc algorithms. The use of expected cost of misclassification (ECM), is introduced as a singular unified measure to compare the performances of different software quality {{classification models}}. A function {{of the costs of}} the Type I (a nfp module misclassified as fp) and Type II (a fp module misclassified as nfp) misclassifications, ECM is computed for different <b>cost</b> <b>ratios.</b> Evaluating software quality classification models in the presence of varying <b>cost</b> <b>ratios</b> is important, because the usefulness of a model is dependent on the system-specific costs of misclassifications. Moreover, models should be compared and preferred for <b>cost</b> <b>ratios</b> that fall within the range of interest for the given system and project domain.

50|$|Medical care ratio (MCR), {{also known}} as medical <b>cost</b> <b>ratio,</b> medical loss ratio, and medical benefit ratio, is a metric used in managed health care and health {{insurance}} to measure medical costs {{as a percentage of}} premium revenues. It is a type of loss ratio, which is a common metric in insurance measuring the percentage of premiums paid out in claims rather than expenses and profit provision. It is calculated by dividing those premiums allocated for fully insured or self-funded health care coverage into the total expenses for inpatient, professional (physicians and other licensed providers), outpatient, and pharmacy. (Briefly, MCR = Costs/Premiums.) As a general rule, a medical <b>cost</b> <b>ratio</b> of 85% or less is desirable. Some insurers now call MCR benefit-cost ratio (BCR). In the United States, the term is medical loss ratio.|$|E

Guidelines for ROI decision making include: 1) Measure fundraising expenses, number of gifts and amount of gifts by fundraising activity and calculate the return on investment for each activity each year. 2) Determine priorities for resource allocation based the outcomes envisioned in your organization’s strategic plan. 3) Calculate fundraising costs and revenues using rolling averages over a period of three t...|$|R

We control for the actual level of compliance by using compliance weighted average scheme <b>cost</b> <b>ratios.</b> The findings suggest that the ESS instrument has a higher cost-effectiveness whereas the NVZ instrument is more expensive on a general level.
