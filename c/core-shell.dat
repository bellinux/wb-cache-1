25|$|Sodium {{borohydride}} {{has been}} considered as a solid state hydrogen storage candidate. Although practical temperatures and pressures for hydrogen storage have not been achieved, in 2012 a <b>core–shell</b> nanostructure of sodium borohydride was used successfully to store, release and reabsorb hydrogen under moderate conditions.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{the core}} (metal)-shell (dielectric) {{nanoparticle}} has demonstrated a zero backward scattering with enhanced forward scattering on Si substrate when surface plasmon {{is located in}} front of a solar cell. The <b>core-shell</b> nanoparticles can support simultaneously both electric and magnetic resonances, demonstrating entirely new properties when compared with bare metallic nanoparticles if the resonances are properly engineered.|$|E
25|$|Very recently, a {{new class}} of ORR electrocatalysts have been {{introduced}} in the case of Pt-M (M-Fe and Co) systems with an ordered intermetallic core encapsulated within a Pt-rich shell. These intermetallic <b>core-shell</b> (IMCS) nanocatalysts were found to exhibit an enhanced activity and most importantly, an extended durability compared to many previous designs. While the observed enhancement in the activities is ascribed to a strained lattice, the authors report that their findings on the degradation kinetics establish that the extended catalytic durability is attributable to a sustained atomic order.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{researchers}} have been investigating ways of reducing the CO content of hydrogen fuel before it enters a fuel cell as a possible way to avoid poisoning the catalysts. One recent study revealed that ruthenium-platinum <b>core–shell</b> nanoparticles are particularly effective at oxidizing CO to form CO2, a much less harmful fuel contaminant. The mechanism that produces this effect is conceptually similar to that described for Pt3Ni above: the ruthenium core of the particle alters the electronic structure of the platinum surface, rendering it better able to catalyze the oxidation of CO.|$|E

Faraday rotation {{with and without}} the plasmonic materials was tested and rotation enhancement under 530nm light irradiation was observed. Researchers claim that {{the magnitude of the}} magneto-optical enhancement is governed primarily by the spectral overlap of the magneto-optical transition and the plasmon resonance.|$|E
2500|$|Yue, et al. used {{a type of}} new materials, called topological insulators, to {{increase}} the absorption of ultrathin a-Si solar cells. The topological insulator nanostructure has intrinsically <b>core-shell</b> configuration. The core is dielectric and has ultrahigh refractive index. The shell is metallic and support surface plasmon resonances. Through integrating the nanocone arrays into a-Si thin film solar cells, up to 15% enhancement of light absorption was predicted in the ultraviolet and visible ranges.|$|E
2500|$|The {{difficulty}} {{in determining the}} exact structure of Nafion stems from inconsistent solubility and crystalline structure among its various derivatives. [...] Advanced morphological models have included a <b>core-shell</b> model where the ion-rich core is surrounded by an ion poor shell, a rod model where the sulfonic groups arrange into crystal-like rods, and a sandwich model where the polymer forms two layers whose sulfonic groups attract across an aqueous layer where transport occurs. [...] Consistency between the models include a network of ionic clusters; the models differ in the cluster geometry and distribution. [...] Although no model has yet been determined fully correct, some scientists have demonstrated that as the membrane hydrates, Nafion's morphology transforms from the Cluster-Channel model to a rod-like model.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} properties of <b>core-shell</b> semiconducting nanocrystals (CSSNCs) is that their cores, which are quantum dots, fluoresce, which is important in their biomedical and optical applications.

The ultrasonically assisted synthesis (sono-synthesis) of hydroxyapatite is a successful technique to produce nanostructured hydroxyapatite at high quality standards. The ultrasonic route allows to produce nano-crystalline hydroxyapatite as well as modified particles, e.g. <b>core-shell</b> nanospheres, and composites.|$|E
50|$|The {{upconversion}} {{process is}} said to be cooperative when there is one or more elementary steps (sensitization or luminescence) in the process which involve multiple lanthanide ions. In cooperative sensitization process, two ions in their excited state simultaneously decay to their ground states, generating a higher energy photon. Similarly, in cooperative luminescence, two excited state ions transfer their energy to a neighboring ion in one elementary step.Energy migration-mediated upconversion (EMU) involves four types of luminescent ion centers with different roles. They are located in separate layers of a <b>core-shell</b> structure of the nanomaterial to inhibit relaxation processes between ions. In this case, low-energy photons are excited in an ETU process that populates an excited state of another ion. Energy from this state can transfer to an adjacent ion through a <b>core-shell</b> interface and is then emitted.|$|E
50|$|<b>Core-shell</b> {{semiconductor}} nanocrystal {{properties are}} based on the relative conduction and valence band edge alignment of the core and the shell.
