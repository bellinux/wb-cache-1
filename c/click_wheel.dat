All iPods (except the 3rd-generation iPod Shuffle, the 6th & 7th generation iPod Nano, and iPod Touch) have five buttons and the later generations have the buttons {{integrated into the}} <b>click</b> <b>wheel</b> – an innovation that gives an uncluttered, minimalist interface. The buttons perform basic functions such as menu, play, pause, next track, and previous track. Other operations, such as scrolling through menu items and controlling the volume, are performed by using the <b>click</b> <b>wheel</b> in a rotational manner. The 3rd-generation iPod Shuffle {{does not have any}} controls on the actual player; instead it has a small control on the earphone cable, with volume-up and -down buttons and a single button for play and pause, next track, etc. The iPod Touch has no click-wheel; instead it uses a touch screen along with a home button, sleep/wake button and (on the second and third generations of the iPod Touch) volume-up and -down buttons. The user interface for the iPod Touch is identical to that of the iPhone. Differences include the lack of a phone application. Both devices use iOS.|$|E

The second-generation Nano {{featured}} scratch-resistant, anodized aluminum casing {{like the}} earlier Mini's design; the multiple color choices mirrored {{those of the}} Mini as well.

50|$|The iPod Mini {{used the}} touch-sensitive scroll {{wheel of the}} third {{generation}} iPod. However, instead of the four touch buttons located above the wheel, the buttons were redesigned as mechanical switches beneath the wheel itself—hence the name <b>click</b> <b>wheel.</b> To {{use one of the}} four buttons, the user physically pushes the edge of the wheel inward over one of the four labels. Like its predecessors, the wheel was developed for Apple by Synaptics. The <b>click</b> <b>wheel</b> is now also used in the fourth, fifth and sixth generation iPods and the iPod Nano, from first generation through the fifth; however, in the Nano and 5G iPods onwards, the <b>click</b> <b>wheel</b> used was developed by Apple.|$|E

Many new types input device are introduced into this field; some of them are aimed to benefit special groups of people like old or disabled persons. In the meantime, Electromyography (EMG) and Inertia Measure Unit (IMU) have been readily available and extensively applied in control systems in many fields. In this paper, we propose a novel EMG-IMU based mouse controller that controls cursor movements based on IMU signals. The displacement of the cursor is determined by integrating the acceleration signal from the IMU, which moves with the operator&# 39;s arm. The mouse operations such as left click, right <b>click</b> and <b>wheel</b> scroll, are commanded through EMG signals. The pattern recognition algorithm, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), is adopted to classify the EMG data into several clusters, which correspond to the pre-defined mouse operations. Experimental results have indicated that the proposed mouse controller can achieve an accuracy of 88 %. IEEE Robotics and Automation Societ...|$|R

Several selector switches control the handwheel's output: one allows each of the machine's axes (X, Y, Z, and so on) to be selected in turn; another shifts through several ranges of output, so that one <b>click</b> of the <b>wheel</b> is either one minimum increment, 10 times that, or 100 times that.|$|R

50|$|In {{the later}} 19th century, Savart's wheel was adapted {{for use in}} {{physiological}} and psychological investigations of the human perception of time. In 1873, the Austrian physiologist Sigmund Exner reported the auditory ability to distinguish successive <b>clicks</b> from the <b>wheel</b> (or, alternatively, rapidly snapped electric sparks) at time intervals as close as 2 milliseconds (1/500 sec). A modified wheel that produced varying numbers of clicks at different intervals was later used by the American psychologists G. Stanley Hall and Joseph Jastrow, who in 1886 reported on the limits to the human perception of acoustic discontinuities. In 1894, French electrical engineer Gustave Trouvé adapted an upright piano to play a series of 88 variously-sized Savart wheels equipping it with an electrical drive system.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{is based on}} research interests of solidarity, loyalty and social lives of children owned by the punk community {{to members of the}} community. In this case there is certainly a communications network that is formed in the punk community in the town of Blitar, is what makes relationships in this community can be established. What makes the communication network that occurred in this community gave birth to the activities that are often held by this punk community. Activities are usually done in this community usually like about the procurement of musical events, social events and the events on the environment. These activities are done jointly with one capital and one aim embroidery. Thus, in this study, researchers are interested to know how the communications network in the punk community in the town of Blitar this happen? Then found the problem is how the communication network within the punk community in the town of Blitar in the treat-tight relationship between fellow members of the punk community. To answer that in the formulation of the problem put forward regarding the communication network, the research method used was qualitative research methods, researchers in this research using network analysis as a method of research, namely the method of research which is based on the convergence of communication models that melandas on cybernetic theory. Data collected by observation, interview and documentation directly to the informants using snowball sampling technique. Then presented with the data obtained and sociogram sosiometri. To maintain credibility of research results, researchers using the technique of 'triangulation of sources "as keabsahaan engineering data. From the results of research on communication networks in the communities in the treat-tight punk hubungn among communities in the town of Blitar punk there are three problems, namely: (1) punk community communication network in the town of Blitar, is formed from the activities which they often interact, ask questions and exchange information about the punk community in the town of Blitar. So, with these activities rise to a sense of solidarity and loyalty are stronger in this community. (2) there are three clicks in the punk community communication network, click the first form of communication network pattern <b>wheel,</b> <b>click</b> the second communication network patterning "Y" and click on the third or click on a majority of the communication network that formed the pattern is the pattern of star communication network or a star pattern or pattern of all channels.

Notably, Apple began reducing pack-in accessories {{starting with the}} fourth generation. While a dock, carrying case, and wired remote were previously included with higher-end iPods, the higher-level 40GB iPod only came with a dock, earphones and an interchangeable proprietary cable capable of USB and FireWire interface.

The case consists of anodized aluminium. First generation iPod Minis were available in five colors: silver, gold, pink, blue, and green.
