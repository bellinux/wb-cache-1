This paper will present a case study in how on-site library staff, university library staff and various diverse university departments came together in a efficient and effective collaborative effort that minimized damage to the library and a co-habiting institute, quickly re-located staff and equipment that resulted in minimal disruption of patron and library services and allowed a previously scheduled open house for the institute to take place within a week. Lessons learned and best practices will also be presented...|$|E

These magnetically levitated planar actuators consist of a single carrier with permanent magnets that is levitated above an array of coils and can move fast and accurately over long distances in the xy-plane. Because the magnets are moving, there are no cables or <b>cooling</b> <b>hoses</b> connected to the moving part. Nevertheless, data and energy can still be transferred, using contactless links.

40|$|The {{theory of}} Cosserat rods {{provides}} a self consistent framework for modeling large spatial deformations of slender flexible structures at small local strains. Discrete Cosserat rod models based on geometric finite differences preserve essential {{properties of the}} continuum theory. The present work investigates kinetic aspects of discrete quaternionic Cosserat rods defined on a staggered grid {{within the framework of}} Lagrangian mechanics. Assuming hyperelastic constitutive behaviour, the Euler–Lagrange equations of the model are shown to be equivalent to the (semi) discrete balance equations of forces, moments and inertial terms obtained from a direct discretization of the continuous balance equations via spatial finite differences along the centerline curve. Therefore, equilibrium configurations obtained by energy minimization correspond to solutions of the quasi-static balance equations. We illustrate this approach by two academic examples (Euler’s Elastica and Kirchhoff’s helix) and highlight its utility for practical applications with a use case from automotive industry (analysis of the layout of <b>cooling</b> <b>hoses</b> in the engine compartment of a passenger car) ...|$|R

50|$|On 17 December 2005 two firefighters from Tübingen, Germany, died {{inside a}} burning {{building}} {{when one of}} the hoses inside the building burst and they were left without extinguishing agent. In the following reconstruction of the tragedy, experts were surprised to find out that CAFS filled hoses are more likely to burst under heat because the foam is unable to <b>cool</b> the <b>hoses</b> sufficiently.|$|R
50|$|Similar to the Testarossa but {{departing from}} the BB 512 and 308/328, {{the oil and}} coolant {{radiators}} were relocated from the nose to the sides, widening the waist of the car substantially, but making the cabin much easier to <b>cool</b> since <b>hoses</b> routing warm water no longer ran underneath the cabin as in the older front-radiator cars. This also had the side effect of making the doors very wide.|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{how to do}} stability analysis, variation simulation and tolerance envelopes for deformable cables and hoses. In this way, the well-established methods for analyzing and minimizing the propagation of geometric variation are extended from rigid and sheet metal assemblies to large deformations of slender parts. This extension is highly motivated, not at least, by the increased amount of cables and hoses in electrified and hybrid solutions in the automotive industry. To secure the geometric correctness of the analysis, we use a nonlinear rod approach {{in the implementation of}} a simulation model of flexible cables that accounts for large deformations and supports a wide range of common cable clip types, cable joints and branches. A selection of measures and visualizations that reflect the spatial effects of geometric variation in deformable cables is incorporated in established variation analysis techniques. In particular, the concept of tolerance envelopes for rigid parts has been extended to also handle system of slender parts such as cables and hoses. This article extends previous research on robust design and variation simulation to cables subject to large deformations and has been successfully applied on two typical industrial cases: a wiring harness attached with various types of clips to a static surrounding and a <b>cooler</b> <b>hose</b> subjected to a high-frequency sampled engine motion...|$|R
5000|$|A minor {{problem was}} the oil hose from {{the lower part of}} the engine to the oil cooler. This was too short since a running engine was moving {{separate}} from the oil <b>cooler.</b> This <b>hose</b> was almost solid being under pressure and in time the oil cooler would crack. This was solved by connecting the oil hoses for the oil cooler to and from the engine [...] "up side down" [...] to make the lower hose, now connecting to the top of the oil cooler, longer and movable.|$|R

25|$|To {{adapt the}} BMW M52 engine to the Defender chassis, the {{engineers}} {{were able to}} utilize some of the parts from the recently developed BMW M51 diesel powered Range Rover 2.5 DSE. They used the clutch housing, clutch, flywheel, and slave cylinder from that vehicle to connect the engine to the R380 gearbox, {{but they had to}} produce a new clutch housing adaptor (bell housing) for the petrol M52 engine in the Defender. The unique clutch housing adaptor was necessary because the petrol M52 engine is tilted 10 degrees compared to the diesel M51 engine and it needed to be longer to match the input shaft of the R380 gearbox borrowed from the 300Tdi Defender. Due to the large diameter gearbox input shaft, the standard BMW pilot bearing could not be fitted, so a unique pilot bushing made of Oilite bronze was developed. It had an inside diameter of 7/8 inch with an outside diameter of 32mm. A mixture of non-metric and metric specifications are common on Land Rovers. Other unique parts that were developed for the 2.8i were the air intake ducts {{both before and after the}} Donaldson FPG RadialSeal™ air cleaner, engine mounts, radiator cowl, <b>cooling</b> <b>hoses,</b> fuel lines, clutch lines, air conditioning system, engine wiring, tachometer gauge, exhaust system, and a specially tuned Siemens MS41.0 DME with a Lucas 10AS alarm in place of the Drive Away Protection system (EWS) used on BMWs. There were also major changes for the 1999 model year, which included updated instrumentation, different chassis and engine wiring, an updated cooling system with aluminum radiator, and an updated fuel system with new fuel tank. The 1.667:1 gear ratio LT230 transfer box gave the vehicle a “rev happy” nature which delighted many off-road enthusiasts and made the vehicle particularly well suited for traversing a wide range of grueling terrain such as sand dunes. The high gear ratio also helped the 2.8i sprint from 0–100km/h in 9.3 seconds, making it the fastest production Defender ever made.|$|R
500|$|On graduation, Born {{was obliged}} to perform his {{military}} service, which he had deferred while a student. He found himself drafted into the German army, and posted to the 2nd Guards Dragoons [...] "Empress Alexandra of Russia", which was stationed in Berlin. His service was brief, as he was discharged early after an asthma attack in January 1907. He then travelled to England, where he was admitted to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and studied physics for six months at the Cavendish Laboratory under J. J. Thomson, George Searle and Joseph Larmor. After Born returned to Germany, the Army re-inducted him, and he served with the elite 1st (Silesian) Life Cuirassiers [...] "Great Elector" [...] until he was again medically discharged after just six weeks' service. He then returned to Breslau, where he worked {{under the supervision of}} Otto Lummer and Ernst Pringsheim, hoping to do his habilitation in physics. A minor accident involving Born's black body experiment, a ruptured <b>cooling</b> water <b>hose,</b> and a flooded laboratory, led to Lummer telling him that he would never become a physicist.|$|R
50|$|Spring clamps are {{typically}} {{made from a}} strip of spring steel, cut so that one side has a narrow protrusion centered on the end, {{and the other side}} a pair of narrow protrusions on either side. The ends of these protrusions are then bent outwards, and the strip rolled to form a ring, with the protruding tabs intermeshing. To use the clamp, the exposed tabs are pressed towards each other (typically using pliers), increasing the diameter of the ring, and the clamp is slid onto the hose, past the portion that will go onto the barb. The hose is then fit onto the barb, the clamp expanded again, slid onto the portion of the hose over the barb, then released, compressing the hose onto the barb. Clamps of this design are rarely used for high pressures or large hoses, as they would require unwieldy amounts of steel to generate enough clamping force, and be impossible to work with using just hand tools. They are commonly used on automotive <b>cooling</b> system <b>hoses</b> several inches in diameter, for example on most water-cooled Volkswagen automobiles.|$|R

40|$|To {{maintain}} {{production in}} high salaries countries and strength in competition against other companies, {{it is today}} {{more important than ever}} to maximize production, offer a wide spectra of products and be able to deliver on the customers desire of shorter and shorter delivery time. Flexible production and short time spent on die changes is vital to achieve these desires. The interest for die changeover time reduction grew in the same pace as the demand for increased product variety grew. SMED as a method of reducing time spent on die changeovers were developed in between 1950 - 1970, by the Japanese Shigeo Shingo. The purpose of this thesis work has been to investigate the result of SMED in a die casting facility, and compare the result from it with the result considering time spent on die changeovers when investing in new equipment. The goal is to implement a thorough investigation by using the SMED method at Tenhults Pressgjuteri AB and make a brochure that have to be simple to understand, in purpose to draw interest to the advantages of using SMED as a method. Commissioned by the Swedish foundry association Swecast, the work has been carried out by studying die changeovers at Tenhults Pressgjuteri AB, where filming and interviews with the operators have been included in the analysis. Meetings have been held with Husqvarna AB about their expected earnings on there new investment. The work with analyzing die changeovers resulted in following suggestions of improvement: • Manuals of adjustments to the sprayer • Rapid couplings to the warmth- and <b>cooling</b> <b>hoses</b> • Eliminating the work of adjustment when changing the ladle • Introduced a combined spanner- torque wrench • Manuals to the mechanical lock The total theoretical improvement of these measures, along with routines for making outside exchange of die before the machine was shut downed, became a reduction of time spent on die changeover with 60 %, from 167 minutes to 66 minutes. That corresponds to a capacity/possible sale increase with 3030 SEK/changeover. The conclusion of this survey is that investing in new equipment is not the best way to gain capacity. Better results can be made just by working with die changeovers on the present machines. If a company has worked with reducing time spent on die changeovers before, and is about to replace an old machine, it could be a cause to invest in new technological details to make the work with die changeovers less complicated...|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} use, however, is {{probably}} in vehicles. It {{is used in}} door seals, window seals, trunk seals, and sometimes hood seals. Frequently, these seals {{are the source of}} noise due to movement of the door against the car body and the resulting friction between the EPDM rubber and the mating surface (painted sheet metal or glass). This can be alleviated using specialty coatings that are applied at the time of manufacture of the weather seal. Such coatings can also greatly increase the chemical resistance of EPDM rubber. Some vehicle manufacturers also recommend a light application of silicone dielectric grease to weatherstripping to reduce noise. Other uses in vehicles include <b>cooling</b> system circuit <b>hoses</b> where water pumps, thermostats, EGR valves, EGR coolers, heaters, oil coolers, radiators, and degas bottles are connected with EPDM hoses, as well as charge air tubing on turbocharged engines to connect the cold side of the charge air cooler (intercooler) to the intake manifold.|$|R
5000|$|Compressed {{gases in}} bottles, like carbon dioxide (CO2), air, and {{nitrogen}} gas (N2). Examples include CO2 in paintball cylinders and air in industrial and SCUBA cylinders. Care {{must be taken}} with bottled gases: as the compressed gas expands, it cools (see gas laws) and rocket components cool as well. Some materials, such as PVC and ABS, can become brittle and weak when severely <b>cooled.</b> Long air <b>hoses</b> are used to maintain a safe distance, and pressure gauges (known as manometers) and safety valves are typically utilized on launcher installations to avoid over-pressurizing rockets and having them explode {{before they can be}} launched. Highly pressurized gases such as those in diving cylinders or vessels from industrial gas suppliers should only be used by trained operators, and the gas should be delivered to the rocket via a regulator device (e.g. a SCUBA first-stage). All compressed gas containers are subject to local, state and national laws in most countries and must be safety tested periodically by a certified test center.|$|R
