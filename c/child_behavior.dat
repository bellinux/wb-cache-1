Behavior {{was a result}} of {{internal}} and external factors such as stimulus and response. Many factors can affect of <b>children</b> <b>behavior</b> on oral health maintenance. This study aims is to identify factors affecting <b>children</b> <b>behavior</b> on oral health maintenance. The study is an observational research with a cross sectional design and all that met inclusion criteria were sampled. Questionnaires with Likert scale were used to assess attitudes, perception, motivation, and behavior variables. The questionnaires showed validity (correlation values ≥ 0. 30) and reliability (alpha Cronbach ≥ 0. 70). The result of multiple regression analysis showed that variables attitude (p = 0. 163) did not affect significantly on the behavior. Variables perception (p = 0. 017) and motivation (p = 0. 006) affected significantly on the behavior. Variables of perception and motivation contribute 40. 0 % (R 2 = 0. 400) to <b>children</b> <b>behavior</b> on oral health maintenance. Motivation gave the highest contribution of 10. 4 % to <b>children</b> <b>behavior</b> on oral health maintenance. Conclusion research, The better and the stronger perception and motivation is the better <b>children</b> <b>behavior</b> on oral health maintenace. Attitude does not affect <b>children</b> <b>behavior</b> on oral health maintenance. Motivation has contributed greatly to the <b>children</b> <b>behavior</b> on oral health maintenance...|$|R

These instruments bring a degree of objectivity and consistency to the clinical assessment. More specialized psychometric testing may be carried out by a psychologist, for example using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, to detect intellectual impairment or other cognitive problems which may be contributing to the child's difficulties.|$|E
500|$|At the {{neighborhood}} level, Hull House established the city’s first public playground, bathhouse, and public gymnasium (in 1893), pursued educational and political reform, and investigated housing, working, and sanitation issues. The playground opened on May Day in 1893, located on Polk Street. Families dressed in party attire {{and came to}} join the celebration that day. Addams became {{the founder of the}} National Playground Association and advocated for playgrounds nationwide. She had studied <b>child</b> <b>behavior</b> and painfully concluded that “children robbed of childhood were likely to become dull, sullen men and women working mindless jobs, or criminals for whom the adventure of crime became the only way {{to break out of the}} bleakness of their lives” [...] Also, one volunteer, Jenny Dow, started a kindergarten class for children left at the settlement while their mothers worked in the sweatshops. Within three weeks, Dow had 24 registered kindergartners and 70 on a waiting list. At the municipal level, their pursuit of legal reforms led to the first juvenile court in the United States, and their work influenced urban planning and the transition to a branch library system. [...] At the state level Hull House influenced legislation on child labor laws, occupational safety and health provisions, compulsory education, immigrant rights, and pension laws. These experiences translated to success at the federal level, working with the settlement house network to champion national child labor laws, women’s suffrage, a children’s bureau, unemployment compensation, workers' compensation, and other elements of the Progressive agenda during the first two decades of the twentieth century.|$|E

Common types of challenging behavior include self-injurious behavior (such as hitting, headbutting, biting), aggressive behavior (such as hitting others, screaming, spitting, kicking, swearing, hairpulling), inappropriate sexualized behavior (such as public masturbation or groping), behavior directed at property (such as throwing objects and stealing) and stereotyped behaviors (such as repetitive rocking, echolalia or elective incontinence).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{similarity}} of outcomes from three different treatment integrity (TI) methods, and to identify the method which best corresponded to the assessment of a <b>child’s</b> <b>behavior.</b> Six raters were recruited through individual contact via snowball sampling. A modified intervention component list and 19 video clips were derived from Stahr’s (2005) study, “An Intervention for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) who Have Food Selectivity. ” The raters, randomly and evenly assigned to three dyads. Each dyad received an average of six hours training and reached 85 % interobserver agreement (IOA) with a 0. 60 kappa score. After training, each dyad watched 5 video clips per day and measured both the <b>child’s</b> <b>behavior</b> and TI. The percentages of IOA, kappas, and indices of dependability for assessment of the <b>child’s</b> <b>behavior</b> and TI were analyzed. The data revealed that all raters reached over 80 % IOA and the whole interval (WI) and yes/no (Y/N) dyads reached. 60 kappa, but the two raters in the Likert-type (LIK) dyad could not reach. 60 kappa. The indices of dependability indicated that the six raters consistently observed and rated both the <b>child’s</b> <b>behavior</b> and TI, but there was a discrepancy in scores (i. e., percentages of TI) between the two raters in the two indirect measure dyads (i. e., Y/N and LIK). An analysis of the percentages of total variance showed that the two indirect TI methods may affect the discrepancy between the two raters’ rating scores. A comparison of the three different TI methods and correlation between the <b>child’s</b> <b>behavior</b> and TI were examined using the PASW Statistics 18 software program. There was no significant difference between the WI and the Y/N dyads, while the assessments from the LIK dyad indicated a significant difference from the other two dyads. Both the WI and the Y/N dyads showed correlations between the degree of the <b>child’s</b> <b>behavior</b> and the degree of TI, but there was no significant difference between the two correlation coefficients. Questions about reliability with the indirect TI measures suggest one should be careful in considering these results...|$|R
