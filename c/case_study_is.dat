5|$|Only {{recently}} have attempts to improve {{health in the}} developing world concentrated on not only physical illness but also mental health. Deliberate self-harm is common {{in the developing world}}. Research into self-harm in the developing world is however still very limited although an important <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> that of Sri Lanka, which is a country exhibiting a high incidence of suicide and self-poisoning with agricultural pesticides or natural poisons. Many people admitted for deliberate self-poisoning during a study by Eddleston et al. were young and few expressed a desire to die, but death was relatively common in the young in these cases. The improvement of medical management of acute poisoning in the developing world is poor and improvements are required in order to reduce mortality.|$|E

The Tsavo lions' prides are unique in that they frequently have only a single male lion with usually seven or eight adult females, as opposed to four females in other lion prides. Tsavo males may have heightened levels of testosterone, which could explain their reputation for aggression and dominance, indicating that lack of mane may at one time have had an alpha correlation.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> {{effective}} for generalizing using {{the type of}} test that Karl Popper called falsification, which forms part of critical reflexivity. Falsification offers {{one of the most}} rigorous tests to which a scientific proposition can be subjected: if just one observation does not fit with the proposition it is considered not valid generally and must therefore be either revised or rejected. Popper himself used the now famous example: [...] "All swans are white", and proposed that just one observation of a single black swan would falsify this proposition and in this way have general significance and stimulate further investigations and theory-building. The <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> well suited for identifying [...] "black swans" [...] because of its in-depth approach: what appears to be [...] "white" [...] often turns out on closer examination to be [...] "black".|$|E
