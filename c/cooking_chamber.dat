25|$|Another hazard is the {{resonance}} of the magnetron tube itself. If the microwave is run without an object {{to absorb the}} radiation, a standing wave will form. The energy is reflected {{back and forth between}} the tube and the <b>cooking</b> <b>chamber.</b> This may cause the tube to overload and burn out. For the same reason, dehydrated food, or food wrapped in metal which does not arc, is problematic for overload reasons, without necessarily being a fire hazard.|$|E
25|$|In {{microwave}} ovens, the waveguide {{leads to}} a radio frequency-transparent port into the <b>cooking</b> <b>chamber.</b> As the fixed dimensions of the chamber, and its physical closeness to the magnetron, would normally create standing wave patterns in the chamber, a motorized fan-like stirrer {{is placed in the}} waveguide to randomize the pattern. This is not always effective for larger objects in the chamber, and most modern microwave ovens also include a rotating table for the food to sit on, called a turntable.|$|E
5000|$|The Chambers Fireless Gas Range was a gas cook stove {{created by}} John E. Chambers in 1910, Two years after inventing his fireless cooker, John Chambers {{organized}} the Chambers Company in 1912. Chambers' patented {{method of manufacture}} [...] used thick rock wool insulation to insulate the oven on all sides. This {{made it possible for}} the heat inside the oven to build up over a short period of time. The gas was then turned off, causing a series of internal dampers to close, which effectively isolated the oven compartment from the outside air. The food would continue to cook on retained heat, thus conserving fuel and reducing food shrinkage. This method of <b>cooking,</b> <b>Chambers</b> literature often claimed, also increased the food value of the cooked items.The Chambers Corporation manufactured successive versions of this design in Shelbyville, Indiana, from 1912 through January, 1955.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the crucial}} factors in safe food {{processing}} is the application of accurate and effective process variable settings, e. g. time-temperature integration in thermal processing systems. However, air in a ventilated process such as inside meat <b>cooking</b> <b>chambers</b> is rarely distributed uniformly due to imperfect mixing of air. This creates non-uniform micro-climate conditions and can result to non-uniform product quality and more crucially to problems on food safety. Being able to define and quantify the degree of 3 D spatio-temporal non-uniformity in temperatures inside food process systems would help improve process conditions to produce equally safe and constant quality food products. This study focused on establishing knowledge {{on the degree of}} airspace temperature non-uniformity during a thermal cooking process inside a force-ventilated, laboratory-scale meat processing chamber. A 3 D-matrix (2 x 3 x 6) of 36 calibrated type-T thermocouples connected to a multi-data acquisition system was used to continuously collect data. Through 3 D visualization, differences in airspace temperatures (maximum 11. 2 ºC) were observed to generally occur during transition stages (come-up/come-down). During holding, temperature differences were found to be consistent. With an acceptable temperature difference of ± 0. 5 ºC, the temperature uniformity index(UI) ranged from 6 %(during come-up) to 100 %(end of cooling). During holding, mean UI was still relatively low at 32 ± 12 %. The cooking process did not attain UI values above 80 % until 25 minutes after cooling started. Moreover, 3 D visualization of the distribution of well-mixed zones(WMZs), i. e. average temperature, cold, and hot zones, and quantifying their volumes at a given process time showed that throughout the heating process, coldest and hottest zones were consistently found to be at the bottom and middle right of the chamber, respectively. This implied that imperfect(non-uniform) mixing of heating medium inside the chamber actually occurred and can be attributed to poor air circulation, lower velocity of injected heating medium, and irregular air flow pattern. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the design and {{performance}} test of pyrolysis burning stoves that produce energy for cooking and biochar. The stove consists of two section chambers, namelycombustion chamber that produces activation heat for pyrolysis process and energy for <b>cooking,</b> andpyrolysis <b>chamber</b> that produces biochar and volatile matter (syngas and tar in gas form). Volatile matter product {{was introduced to the}} combustion chamber in addition to the biomass there and replaces biomass fuel gradually to produce energy for cooking and keeping the continuous pyrolysis process (autothermal). Methode used for performance test: direct observations/measurements and Water Boilling Test (WBT). Result of performance test: the autothermal process was going well until resulting a 100 % biochar for most of the biomass used. Thermal efficiency of the stove was 11. 3 % (before pyrolysis) and 14. 72 % (after pyrolysis), excluding heat to produce biochar. Time needed to boil a 5 L water was 12 minutes before pyrolysis and 6 minutes after pyrolysis. Output power ranges from 9. 60 kW to 23. 16 kW. The maximum temperature reached 868 °C at the pan and 860 oC in combustion chamber. Input biomass capacity {{depending on the type of}} feedstock ranging from 1200 - 3000 g/process, resulting in 507 - 900 g biochar/process, to give biochar ratio to raw materials from 23. 0 % to 44. 8 %. All maximum conditions occurs when volatilematters produced from pyrolysis process were burned, which showed that burning volatile matters is better than burning solid biomass directly. The amount of biochar produced by this stove was three times higher compared to anila stove, with less of smoke during the biochar production...|$|R
25|$|The <b>cooking</b> <b>chamber</b> {{is similar}} to a Faraday cage to prevent the waves from coming out of the oven. Even though there is no {{continuous}} metal-to-metal contact around the rim of the door, choke connections on the door edges act like metal-to-metal contact, at the frequency of the microwaves, to prevent leakage. The oven door usually has a window for easy viewing, with a layer of conductive mesh some distance from the outer panel to maintain the shielding. Because the size of the perforations in the mesh is much less than the microwaves' wavelength (12.2 cm for the usual 2.45 GHz), microwave radiation cannot pass through the door, while visible light (with its much shorter wavelength) can.|$|E
25|$|All cavity {{magnetrons}} {{consist of}} a heated cathode placed at a high (continuous or pulsed) negative potential created by a high-voltage, direct-current power supply. The cathode {{is placed in the}} center of an evacuated, lobed, circular chamber. A magnetic field parallel to the filament is imposed by a permanent magnet. The magnetic field causes the electrons, attracted to the (relatively) positive outer part of the chamber, to spiral outward in a circular path, a consequence of the Lorentz force. Spaced around the rim of the chamber are cylindrical cavities. Slots are cut {{along the length of the}} cavities that open into the central, common cavity space. As electrons sweep past these slots, they induce a high-frequency radio field in each resonant cavity, which in turn causes the electrons to bunch into groups. (This principle of cavity resonator is very similar to blowing a stream of air across the open top of a glass pop bottle.) A portion of the radio frequency energy is extracted by a short antenna that is connected to a waveguide (a metal tube, usually of rectangular cross section). The waveguide directs the extracted RF energy to the load, which may be a <b>cooking</b> <b>chamber</b> in a microwave oven or a high-gain antenna in the case of radar.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{characteristics}} of the offset smoker are that the <b>cooking</b> <b>chamber</b> is usually cylindrical in shape, with a shorter, smaller diameter cylinder attached {{to the bottom of}} one end for a firebox. To cook the meat, a small fire is lit in the firebox, where airflow is tightly controlled.

50|$|The {{majority}} of Shelton's inventions after founding Winston Industries focused on solving {{problems in the}} food industry. His patents relating to food preparation include an automatic oven that cooks food and then automatically drops the cooked food onto a pivoting platform for sale (US 5990452 A), a food storage device that provides a method of controlling humidity in the <b>cooking</b> <b>chamber</b> (US 5595109 A) and a thermalizing apparatus using both wet bulb and dry bulb temperature sensors to more precisely control cooking parameters inside a <b>cooking</b> <b>chamber</b> (US 6521871 B1).|$|E

5000|$|Thanks {{to short}} cooking {{times and the}} {{presence}} of steam inside the <b>cooking</b> <b>chamber,</b> combi steamers preserve vitamins and nutrients significantly more effectively than conventional cooking methods.

50|$|The furnaces, {{dating back}} to the I century A.D. and half of the V century A.D., are {{arranged}} in a terraced form, longitudinally on the axis north south, with a diameter of about 3 metres, and besides a cooking surface well maintained, an unusual state of preservation of the calotte-shaped <b>cooking</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other special modes are {{available}} as well, such as cooking by monitoring core temperature, Delta-T cooking (monitoring {{the difference between}} the core temperature and the temperature inside the <b>cooking</b> <b>chamber),</b> low-temperature cooking, and regenerating pre-cooked, cooled food.

More and more modern units operate using electronic sensor controls, which provide additional advantages in terms of both food preparation options and time efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Another hazard is the {{resonance}} of the magnetron tube itself. If the microwave is run without an object {{to absorb the}} radiation, a standing wave will form.

50|$|Some of {{the newer}} hybrid stoves cater more towards the {{emergency}} preparedness/survivalist market {{with the ability to}} use propane, charcoal or wood.

50|$|Ovens usually can use {{a variety}} of methods to cook. The most common may be to heat the oven from below. This is {{commonly}} used for baking and roasting. The oven may also be able to heat from the top to provide broiling (US) or grilling (UK/Commonwealth). In order to provide faster, more-even cooking, a fan oven, which has a fan with a heating element around, that provides the heat. Or a fan-assisted oven that use a small fan to circulate the air in the <b>cooking</b> <b>chamber,</b> can be used. Both also known as convection ovens. An oven may also provide an integrated rotisserie.|$|E
50|$|The {{steaming}} function {{works very}} well for foods like vegetables, potatoes and fish, while convection or combination (convection plus steam) heat is suitable for roasting, braising and baking. One disadvantage of convection heat is that foods tend to dry out more quickly; depending on the product, it may also require very long cooking times. Meanwhile, steaming alone does not get foods crispy enough. Combining convection and steam heat utilizes the advantages provided by each cooking method, yielding tender meat with a crisp outer crust. Users also have complete control over the cooking environment, as the devices allow manual regulation of both temperature and humidity within the <b>cooking</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|E

50|$|Some archaelogical {{studies have}} proven {{that there were}} at least two {{different}} phases of utilization during the Roman domination, which led to a progressive restriction of the <b>cooking</b> <b>chamber</b> of the furnaces, after each restoration.

The furnaces were used once for the cooking and production of materials intended for home and building use (dishes, amphoras, tiles and bricks, flat tiles and ordinary ceramics) and they make think of the existence of a productive and handicraft complex strongly connected with the commercial activities of the near port of Castellammare del Golfo, located in a favourable position for the commercial routes of the Mediterranean towards Spain, Sardenia and Rome.|$|E

This implied that imperfect mixing of heating medium inside the chamber actually occurred which may be due to poor air circulation, lower injection velocity, irregular air flow pattern, and asymmetrical air circulation system construction. Compared to room temperature difference, the product core temperature difference was considered to be relatively low (maximum 0. 6 ºC). However, the core temperature recorded by the control sensor was 4. 3 °C to 6. 1 °C higher than that recorded by a matrix sensor positioned 1 cm apart inside the same product, which led to an F-value variation of 41 %. Thus, {{at the end of the}} cooking process, products were actually underprocessed due to lower core temperatures achieved. This showed that temperature measurements were also sensitive to the position of the core temperature sensor inside the product and can definitely affect product safety. status: publishe...|$|E
