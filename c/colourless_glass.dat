25|$|From around 70 AD <b>colourless</b> <b>glass</b> {{becomes the}} {{predominant}} material for fine wares, and the cheaper glasses move towards pale shades of blue, green, and yellow. Debate continues whether {{this change in}} fashion indicates a change in attitude that placed glass as individual material of merit no longer required to imitate precious stones, ceramics, or metal, or whether the shift to <b>colourless</b> <b>glass</b> indicated an attempt to mimic highly prized rock crystal. Pliny's Natural History states that “the most highly valued glass is colourless and transparent, {{as closely as possible}} resembling rock crystal” (36, 192), which is thought to support this last position, as is evidence for the persistence of casting as a production technique, which produced the thickly walled vessels necessary to take the pressure of extensive cutting and polishing associated with crystal working.|$|E
25|$|Experimenting {{with the}} new technology, the forest glassmakers found it {{difficult}} to achieve the high standards of clarity and colour of the Roman methods, due mainly to the great variability of colour-controlling elements in the raw materials. European sand and soil is generally higher in iron and manganese. Iron gives a blue-green tinge to glass under usual furnace atmosphere conditions, but also may give a yellow colour. Manganese has its own purple colour which may balance out the iron colour to make <b>colourless</b> <b>glass.</b> For instance, glass made from beech wood grown on meagre lime-rich soil (e.g. Kleinlutzel, Jura) is high in manganese and thus, nearly colourless while that in a clay-rich area (e.g. Court-Chalvet, Jura) is olive green. Thus, a variety of colours may be produced and experimentation allowed the glassmakers to progress from the early muddy green-yellow-brown colours toward clear-coloured and <b>colourless</b> <b>glass.</b> Local conditions allowed some areas to produce finer glass at an earlier stage. In Bohemia {{at the end of the}} sixteenth century the decolourising powers of manganese were used to produce a clear glass suitable for engraving. The amount of carbon left in the wood ash also may affect the colour of the glass by modifying the furnace atmosphere. The glass in York Minster has been shown to be 90% naturally coloured, without added colorants.|$|E
2500|$|The {{chemical}} composition of Anglo-Saxon glass vessels {{is very similar}} to late Roman glass, which has high amounts of iron, manganese and titanium. The slightly higher amounts of iron in the Early Anglo-Saxon glass results in a <b>colourless</b> <b>glass,</b> with a green-yellow tinge. By the end of the 7th century some innovations can be observed. With generally better quality glass, a greater range of colours found {{and the beginning of the}} tendency to use a second colour for decoration. [...] Most Anglo-Saxon vessels were free blown, although occasionally some mould blown examples are found, mostly with vertical ribbing. The rims were fire rounded, sometimes slightly thickened and cupped, rolled or folded either inwards or outwards. Decoration was accomplished almost entirely by the application of trails which could be in the same colour as the vessel or contrasting, or in the form of a reticella like trail.|$|E
25|$|However, {{during the}} last thirty years of the 1st century AD there was a marked change in style, with strong colours disappearing rapidly, {{replaced}} by ‘aqua’ and true <b>colourless</b> <b>glasses.</b> <b>Colourless</b> and ‘aqua’ <b>glasses</b> had been in use for vessels and some mosaic designs prior to this, but start to dominate the blown glass market at this time. The use of strong colours in cast glass died out during this period, with <b>colourless</b> or 'aqua' <b>glasses</b> dominating the last class of cast vessels to be produced in quantity, as mould and free-blowing took over during the 1st century AD.|$|R
30|$|The low {{antimony}} oxide values {{for most of}} the Jebel Khalid <b>glasses,</b> including the <b>colourless</b> samples, fall below 0.09  %. Greenish to <b>colourless</b> <b>glasses</b> with slightly elevated antimony levels include colourless JK 13 (0.11  %) and JK 52 (0.13  %), greenish JK 20 (0.10  %), and greenish colourless JK 35 (0.22  %).|$|R
30|$|All {{but one of}} {{the glasses}} have a similar iron content, and this oxide is {{probably}} responsible for producing the various shades of green and light blue. In the absence of other identifiable colouring agents, the amber colour is likely due to the formation of the ferri-sulphide complex in a reducing atmosphere [2, 66]. Iron colouration is counteracted in the <b>colourless</b> <b>glasses</b> by manganese.|$|R
60|$|I also {{carefully}} {{removed the}} secretion from four glands with a sharply pointed piece of blotting-paper, {{so that they}} were exposed for a time naked to the air, but this caused no movement; yet these glands were [page 29] in an efficient state, for after 24 hrs. had elapsed, they were tried with bits of meat, and all became quickly inflected. It then {{occurred to me that}} particles floating on the secretion would cast shadows on the glands, which might be sensitive to the interception of the light. Although this seemed highly improbable, as minute and thin splinters of <b>colourless</b> <b>glass</b> acted powerfully, nevertheless, after it was dark, I put on, by the aid of a single tallow candle, as quickly as possible, particles of cork and glass on the glands of a dozen tentacles, {{as well as some of}} meat on other glands, and covered them up so that not a ray of light could enter; but by the next morning, after an interval of 13 hrs., all the particles were carried to the centres of the leaves.|$|E
6000|$|A {{miniature}} breaker, spreading {{with a soft}} [...] "swish" [...] {{upon the}} sand brought with it something round and shiny that rolled back again as the wave receded. The next influx beached it clear, and Geddie picked it up. The thing was a long-necked wine bottle of <b>colourless</b> <b>glass.</b> The cork had been driven in tightly {{to the level of}} the mouth, and the end covered with dark-red sealing-wax. The bottle contained only what seemed to be a sheet of paper, much curled from the manipulation it had undergone while being inserted. In the sealing-wax was the impression of a seal--probably of a signet-ring, bearing the initials of a monogram; but the impression had been hastily made, and the letters were past anything more certain than a shrewd conjecture. Ida Payne had always worn a signet-ring in preference to any other finger decoration. Geddie thought he could make out the familiar [...] "I P"; and a queer sensation of disquietude went over him. More personal and intimate was this reminder of her than had been the sight of the vessel she was doubtless on. He walked back to his house, and set the bottle on his desk.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, you spoil it!' {{the young}} man exclaimed--a speech of which she took no notice but which made her think him {{brighter}}, {{as they used to}} say at home. He was brighter still after they had descended from the train at the Temple station (they had meant to go on to Blackfriars, but they jumped out on seeing the sign of the Temple, fired with the thought of visiting that institution too) and got admission to the old garden of the Benchers, which lies beside the foggy, crowded river, and looked at the tombs of the crusaders in the low Romanesque church, with the cross-legged figures sleeping so close to the eternal uproar, and lingered in the flagged, homely courts of brick, with their much-lettered door-posts, their dull old windows and atmosphere of consultation--lingered to talk of Johnson and Goldsmith and to remark how London opened one's eyes to Dickens; and he was brightest of all when they stood in the high, bare cathedral, which suggested a dirty whiteness, saying it was fine but wondering why it was not finer and letting a glance as cold as the dusty, <b>colourless</b> <b>glass</b> fall upon epitaphs that seemed to make most of the defunct bores even in death. Mr. Wendover was decorous but he was increasingly gay, and these qualities appeared in him {{in spite of the fact}} that St. Paul's was rather a disappointment. Then they felt the advantage of having the other place--the one Laura had had in mind at dinner--to fall back upon: that perhaps would prove a compensation. They entered a hansom now (they had to come to that, though they had walked also from the Temple to St. Paul's) and drove to Lincoln's Inn Fields, Laura making the reflection as they went that it was really a charm to roam about London under valid protection--such a mixture of freedom and safety--and that perhaps she had been unjust, ungenerous to her sister. A good-natured, positively charitable doubt came into her mind--a doubt that Selina might have the benefit of. What she liked in her present undertaking was the element of the imprévu that it contained, and perhaps it was simply the same happy sense of getting the laws of London--once in a way--off her back that had led Selina to go over to Paris to ramble about with Captain Crispin. Possibly they had done nothing worse than go together to the Invalides and Notre Dame; and if any one were to meet her driving that way, so far from home, with Mr. Wendover--Laura, mentally, did not finish her sentence, overtaken as she was by the reflection that she had fallen again into her old assumption (she had been in and out of it a hundred times), that Mrs. Berrington had met Captain Crispin--the idea she so passionately repudiated. She at least would never deny that she had spent the afternoon with Mr. Wendover: she would simply say that he was an American and had brought a letter of introduction.|$|E
25|$|Glass making {{reached its}} peak at the {{beginning}} of the 2nd century AD, with glass objects in domestic contexts of every kind. The primary production techniques of blowing, and to a lesser extent casting, remained in use for the rest of the Roman period, with changes in vessel types but little change in technology. From the 2nd century onwards styles became increasingly regionalised, and evidence indicates that bottles and closed vessels such as unguentaria moved as a by-product of the trade in their contents, and many appear to have matched the Roman scale of liquid measurement. The use of coloured glass as a decorative addition to pale and <b>colourless</b> <b>glasses</b> also increased, and metal vessels continued to influence the shape of glass vessels. After the conversion of Constantine, glass works began to move more quickly from depicting Pagan religious imagery towards Christian religious imagery. The movement of the capital to Constantinople rejuvenated the Eastern glass industry, and the presence of the Roman military in the western provinces did much to prevent any downturn there. By the mid-4th century mould-blowing was in use only sporadically.|$|R
30|$|The {{anonymous}} late sixteenth-century French manuscript from Toulouse BnF Ms. Fr. 640 (Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris), {{not included}} in the earlier review [8], mentions <b>colourless</b> ground <b>glass</b> several times. It is being transcribed and translated for an online critical edition during ‘The Making and Knowing Project’ directed by Pamela H. Smith at Columbia University, New York [16]. This historical source, {{in the form of a}} ‘book of secrets’, is especially helpful in furthering understanding of the motivation behind the use of this additive, since it gives a more explicit explanation as to why it might have been used, and what properties it was considered to confer to the oil paint.|$|R
5000|$|Around 1663, George Ravenscroft {{developed}} flint <b>glass,</b> a <b>colourless</b> and translucent <b>glass</b> {{with many}} desirable working properties. [...] The original recipe {{was subject to}} crizzling.

Lead glass was widely adopted by the Glass seller’s guild when Ravenscroft’s patent expired.|$|R

50|$|Selenium dioxide imparts a {{red colour}} to glass. It {{is used in}} small {{quantities}} to counteract the colour due to iron impurities and so to create (apparently) <b>colourless</b> <b>glass.</b> In larger quantities, it gives a deep ruby red colour.|$|E
50|$|Gold-band {{glass is}} a related Hellenistic and Roman technique, where strips of gold leaf, {{sandwiched}} between <b>colourless</b> <b>glass,</b> {{are used as}} part of the marbling effect in onyx glass. It is mostly found in small perfume bottles and the like.|$|E
30|$|The {{pigments}} {{found in}} the fifteenth-century paintings were familiar—verdigris for greens, azurite and ultramarine for the blues, vermilion, red lead and red lakes for the reds and so on. Of most interest were two materials that functioned not as pigments but as additives to modify {{the properties of the}} paint; <b>colourless</b> powdered <b>glass,</b> and zinc sulphate, also known as zinc vitriol or white vitriol. These were also seen in the sixteenth-century works, but there were differences among the pigments when compared to the earlier paintings, such as the occasional use of the rare pigments fluorite and vivianite, and more significantly the introduction of the blue pigment smalt and a green mineral pigment composed predominantly of a copper sulphate.|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} of the decorative traditions used in the Early Islamic Period concerned the manipulation of the glass itself, and included trail-application, carving, and mold-blowing. As mentioned previously, glass-carving and trail application are a continuation of older techniques, the former associated with Sassanian glassmaking and the latter with Roman traditions. In relief cutting, a specialized form of glass-carving most often used on <b>colourless</b> and transparent <b>glass,</b> [...] "the area surrounding the decorative elements was carved back to the ground, thus leaving the former in relief".|$|R
30|$|Bringing {{together}} {{the results from}} the technical examinations of the materials in fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Netherlandish and French paintings during the National Gallery cataloguing programmes, and re-evaluating them in the context of earlier research has provided new insights, strengthening the earlier hypotheses {{made on the basis of}} fewer analyses. The <b>colourless</b> powdered <b>glass</b> found often as a paint additive in paintings of this period shows interesting trends in composition, with glass of a high lime‒low alkali composition predominating in the later paintings, an observation that could be useful in helping to date paintings in the future. Zinc sulphate, although less common than glass as an additive, was nevertheless more widespread than has been recognised, and it is important to be aware that it can be present in these early paintings when carrying out non-invasive analyses, since the detection of zinc might be mistakenly interpreted as indicating the presence of zinc white in later non-original paint.|$|R

50|$|Enamel {{was also}} used to {{decorate}} glass vessels during the Roman period, and {{there is evidence of}} this as early as the late Republican and early Imperial periods in the Levant, Egypt, Britain and around the Black Sea.

40|$|A project {{focused on}} the study of early {{vitreous}} materials and amber from Italy has been developed in cooperation with the Italian Institute of Pre- and Proto-history. The results of the archaeometric investigation of the early vitreous materials in Sardinia are reported in the preset work. About 100 samples of faïence, glassy faïence and glasses from 14 different Sardinian sites have been selected for the analyses in cooperation with the archaeologists studying the materials (P. Bellintani, A. Usai and M. A. Fadda). The Nuragic vitreous materials date from the Italian Middle Bronze Age 3 (MBA 3) to the Early Iron Age (EIA). The majority of the beads exhibit simple typology, the correlation with coeval material may be done therefore mainly on the base of the chemical, textural and mineralogical composition. The chemical composition was investigated by EPMA and SEM-EDS; whereas the textural study was performed by Digital Image Processing (DIP) of the backscattered electrons SEM images. A group of black faience, characterized by a very high content of Mn and Fe is present and do not show compositional correlation with known beads from continental Italy, Egypt and Near East. All the Sardinian glass beads have HMG and LMG composition. Surprisingly no LMHK typical of the North Italian and Central European Final Bronze Age (FBA) productions are present. Yellow lead antimonite glass with HMG composition, known in Egypt since XIV cent. BC, have been detected in Sardinia as early as the Recent Bronze Age proving a rapid diffusion of this material in the West Mediterranean area, whereas in Central and Northern Italy yellow glass appears only in the VIII cent. BC and are LMG glasses, such as the FBA-EIA yellow glass from Sardinia. The analysed finds from Sardinia include also: amber coloured beads, Co end Cu blue beads, <b>colourless</b> <b>glasses,</b> and turquoise beads with eyes decoration. The glasses generally do not exhibit chemical correlations with the coeval continental Italian vitreous materials, but in some case the Sardinian glasses show similarity with Egyptian and/or Near East finds, whereas in other case display particular composition, that do not have to date clear analytical comparison...|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of these factors, the cost of {{production}} was reduced and glass became available for a wider section of society in a growing variety of forms. By the mid-1st century AD this meant that glass vessels had moved from a valuable, high-status commodity, to a material commonly available: “a glass drinking cup could be bought for a copper coin” (Strabo, Geographica XVI.2). This growth also saw the production of the first glass tesserae for mosaics, and the first window glass, as furnace technology improved allowing molten glass to be produced for the first time. At the same time, the expansion of the empire also brought an influx of people and an expansion of cultural influences that resulted in the adoption of eastern decorative styles. The changes {{that took place in the}} Roman glass industry during this period can therefore be seen as {{a result of}} three primary influences: historical events, technical innovation and contemporary fashions. They are also linked to the fashions and technologies developed in the ceramic trade, from which a number of forms and techniques were drawn.Glass making reached its peak at the beginning of the 2nd century AD, with glass objects in domestic contexts of every kind. The primary production techniques of blowing, and to a lesser extent casting, remained in use for the rest of the Roman period, with changes in vessel types but little change in technology.

50|$|This {{window was}} {{restored}} from 1978-1980. Valuable pieces of medieval glass (1300) {{were used in}} the restoration process. The abbey started operating two glassworks in the 13th century. During the glass making process various pigments from natural resources, for example earths, salts or metal-oxides were added to the <b>colourless</b> heated <b>glass</b> to achieve unique colour schemes. The coloured glass sections were then held together with strips of lead. Then the ornamental motives were painted. Despite early Cistercian rules stressing simplicity, the entire abbey church was completely fitted with coloured windows during the 14th century. Depicted are John the Baptist, Virgin Mary with the Christ child in Bethlehem, John the Evangelist and beneath him Duchess Anastasia von Mecklenburg (died 1317), who sponsored a window for the abbey church. Beneath the windows are stone tablets commemorating the victims of war and violence. The church community added the two outermost plates in 1985, 40 years after the ending of World War II. They name some places of murder and cruelty and admonish us to keep peace and justice.|$|R
50|$|Pearson and {{her husband}} James came to public {{attention}} through works shown at the Society of Artists of Great Britain in its exhibitions in 1775-77. The works she showed there were mostly depictions of birds, especially parrots and parakeets. Most of her output consisted of works on a single sheet of glass.

50|$|In the Middle East, {{the glass}} {{industry}} of Syria continued during the Islamic period with major centres of manufacture at Raqqa, Aleppo and Damascus {{and the most}} important products being highly transparent <b>colourless</b> <b>glass</b> and gilded glass, rather than coloured glass.

Roman glass production developed from Hellenistic technical traditions, initially concentrating on the production of intensely coloured cast glass vessels. However, during the 1st century AD the industry underwent rapid technical growth that saw the introduction of glass blowing and the dominance of <b>colourless</b> or ‘aqua’ <b>glasses.</b> Production of raw glass was undertaken in geographically separate locations to the working of glass into finished vessels, {{and by the end of}} the 1st century AD large scale manufacturing resulted in the establishment of glass as a commonly available material in the Roman world, and one which also had technically very difficult specialized types of luxury glass, which must have been very expensive.|$|R
40|$|In situ {{absorbance}} {{of visible}} light by white wine in bottles was determined with a modified spectrophotometer. A linear correlation was obtained between absorbance at 420 nm A₄₂₀ measured in a cuvette (10 mm pathlength) and absorbance {{of that same}} wine measured in a 750 mL Flint bottle (<b>colourless</b> transparent <b>glass).</b> In addition, 5 types of coloured bottles, Emerald Green, Classic Green, French Green, Georgia Green and Cobalt Blue, also yielded strong correlations. A₄₂₀ of white wine in bottles of Antique Green or Amber glass could not be measured directly due to a strong absorbance of that wavelength by the glass. However, a strong correlation was established between measurement of A₄₂₀ (cuvette) and A₅₄₀ for white wine in Antique Green bottles and between A₄₂₀ (cuvette) and either A₅₄₀ or A₆₀₀ for white wine in Amber bottles. The method employed a standard UV-Visible spectrophotometer with an inexpensive modified sample port, and proved applicable to bottles with diameters ranging from 62 mm (375 mL capacity half bottles) up to 81 mm (750 mL capacity Burgundy bottles). In situ absorbance measurements plus subsequent chemical analysis and sensory assessment of a Chardonnay wine in Antique Green bottles showed that the method provided an estimate of oxidation in this white wine. Wine absorbance spectra over the full visible range were obtained in the Flint bottle. Measurements of the absorbance of visible light by the glass of empty bottles could also be obtained and used {{as a form of}} quality control for glass bottle manufacture. George K.

This was the shuffling of the Minimuls' shoes, which are flat, like sandals, and made of silver grass plaited together, that rustles on the sandy floor of their chambers and galleries. This plaited grass they tie, too, round their middles for a belt or pouch, beneath which, as they walk, their long lean tails descend.

50|$|Experimenting {{with the}} new technology, the forest glassmakers found it {{difficult}} to achieve the high standards of clarity and colour of the Roman methods, due mainly to the great variability of colour-controlling elements in the raw materials. European sand and soil is generally higher in iron and manganese. Iron gives a blue-green tinge to glass under usual furnace atmosphere conditions, but also may give a yellow colour. Manganese has its own purple colour which may balance out the iron colour to make <b>colourless</b> <b>glass.</b> For instance, glass made from beech wood grown on meagre lime-rich soil (e.g. Kleinlutzel, Jura) is high in manganese and thus, nearly colourless while that in a clay-rich area (e.g. Court-Chalvet, Jura) is olive green. Thus, a variety of colours may be produced and experimentation allowed the glassmakers to progress from the early muddy green-yellow-brown colours toward clear-coloured and <b>colourless</b> <b>glass.</b> Local conditions allowed some areas to produce finer glass at an earlier stage. In Bohemia {{at the end of the}} sixteenth century the decolourising powers of manganese were used to produce a clear glass suitable for engraving. The amount of carbon left in the wood ash also may affect the colour of the glass by modifying the furnace atmosphere. The glass in York Minster has been shown to be 90% naturally coloured, without added colorants.|$|E
25|$|In post-Roman times {{political}} {{problems in the}} Wadi El Natrun area disrupted the supply of natron so alternatives had to be developed. Eastern glassmakers reverted to using sodium-rich plant ash {{and for a while}} supplied southern Europe, using existing Roman trade routes, however, the Venetian glassmakers, who had inherited the Roman glassmaking skills, monopolised the trade in plant ash and banned craftsmen from working outside the city. The rest of Europe, north of the Alps, had to find another way of producing glass. The former and stabiliser components of glass occur in all regions as sand or quartz and as lime of various forms. The northern Europeans experimented with using ash from wood, ferns, and bracken as a source of the alkali flux. At its height the Roman glass industry was producing high quality, thin, <b>colourless,</b> and clear <b>glass</b> of consistent composition. The earlier surviving Forest glass vessels are characterised by a wide variety of compositions and lower quality, often being greenish to brownish in colour, thick-walled, and with inclusions and bubbles in the fabric. This suggests that using wood-ash was not just a case of changing the raw material, but necessitated a whole new technology with attendant development problems.|$|R
40|$|This paper reports results {{derived from}} a chemico-physical {{characterisation}} study undertaken on an important ensamble of early 20 th century stained glass windows from Madrid and signed by the prestigious and well-known Maumejean Fréres company. The study {{is part of an}} on-going project of restoration and conservation carried out by the National Glass Centre Foundation (FCNV, La Granja de San Ildefonso, Segovia, Spain). The basic aim of the research was to assess their current state of conservation and to study the degree of damage suffered throughout the last century by different materials employed in their production, namely <b>colourless</b> and coloured <b>glasses,</b> grisailles, lead cames, and putties used to fix glass pieces into the lead cames. Selected samples from these materials were characterised through optical microscopy (OM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX), VIS spectrophotometry, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). As a general rule, most of them presented an acceptable state of conservation, without any of the known degradation phenomena of more ancient stained glasses (e. g. Medieval, Renaissance, etc.). However, some remarkable alterations were observed. Important deposits of soot and dirt particles coming from a polluted urban environment were detected, producing a slow blackening of the panels. Resulting data have been useful to design and optimise a combined conservation and restoration strategy in the recovery of this valuable legacy of early 20 th century stained glass windows from Madrid...|$|R
50|$|The Jarvis Street Baptist Church was {{designed}} in the Gothic Revival style by the architectural firm of Henry Langley and Edmund Burke who served for many years at Jarvis Street Baptist Church as a Sunday-school teacher, chair of the choir committee, and deacon. It {{was one of the}} first churches in Canada to be built with an amphitheatre-shaped interior. The ground floor seating is grouped in a semicircle, while the gallery above is horseshoe shaped.The main façade of the building is made out brown stone that is obtained from the regions of Queenstown. The stone is laid unevenly with a pattern that varies in different shades of browns and dark yellows. The material used for the roof is Canadian slate. The roof is constructed from a series of pitched segments that are centrally connected by a horizontally sliced dome. There are eight entrances, each consisting of solid oak double doors framed with pointed sandstone arches. Several of these doors have been blocked off with black cast iron gates. Triangular sets of small rosette windows are placed above every door to fill the space in between the entrance and the top of the arch. The building has number of columns with slim tall shape and different capitals that are loosely based on a Corinthian order. The capitals are made of gray stone while the columns are of a high quality bronze shaded granite found in St. George, New Brunswick. The main entrance is set under the only tower of the building facing the south west side which serves as a vertical axis to the building. A copper spire sits on top of the tower, adding approximately nine metres to the existing roof height. In addition to the vertical axis the building also has a horizontal symmetry axis that goes diagonally through the building. The flat-roofed extension of the church, built after the 1938 fire, was constructed with red brick masonry which contrasts with the charred Queenston façade. Tall, thin arched windows cover the walls of the church, with the exception of the extension building whose windows are rectangular. The windows are divided into squares and diamonds of yellow and <b>colourless</b> textured <b>glass.</b> Many of the windows are aligned with one another. However a few of the smaller windows are offset to form a step-like pattern. The white wood framing of the windows contrasts with the colourful exterior stone. The building is heavily decorated with ornaments at the top of every pitched roof and throughout the spire. Gargoyles align with the entrance doors, and rippled arches are engraved in the building.|$|R
