The jab {{is accompanied by a}} small, <b>clockwise</b> <b>rotation</b> of the torso and hips, while the fist rotates 90 degrees, becoming horizontal upon impact. As the punch reaches full extension, the lead shoulder can be brought up to guard the chin. The rear hand remains next to the face to guard the jaw. After making contact with the target, the lead hand is retracted quickly to resume a guard position in front of the face.|$|E

30|$|The {{first and}} nearest {{contributor}} {{may be the}} major faults developed in East Asia. Indeed, the Korean Peninsula is bounded by two major faults of the Tan-Lu fault to the northwest and the Korea-Taiwan strait fault to the southeast (Figure  1 inset). Both fault systems are northeast-southwest trending sinistral in motion (Grimmer et al. 2002; Wang 2006). Such mega-sized sinistral faults could have facilitated <b>clockwise</b> <b>rotations</b> of the Korean Peninsula with respect to China, as in synthetic R-type Riedel shear. Diminishing clockwise motion since the Jurassic fits well with the period of active motion of the Tan-Lu fault (Klimetz 1983). It {{should be noted that}} similar <b>clockwise</b> <b>rotations</b> of paleomagnetic poles were also observed in Benxi area, China (Uchimura et al. 1996).|$|R
50|$|There are 4 face centre pieces. These can be permutated in at most 4! {{different}} ways. However, {{the exact}} number of these permutations is not yet reached due to two constraints. The first constraint is that only even permutations of the face centers are possible (e.g. it is impossible to have only two face centre pieces swapped); this divides the limit by 2. The second constraint is that all centre permutations are dependent on the orientation of the corner pieces. Some permutations of centres are only possible when the total number of <b>clockwise</b> <b>rotations</b> of corner pieces is divisible by 3; other permutations are only possible when the total number of <b>clockwise</b> <b>rotations</b> is equivalent to 1 modulo 3; others are only possible when the number is equivalent to 2 modulo 3. This divides the limit by 3.|$|R
25|$|In physics, the Coriolis {{force is}} an {{inertial}} force that acts on {{objects that are}} in motion relative to a rotating reference frame. In a reference frame with <b>clockwise</b> <b>rotation,</b> the force acts {{to the left of}} the motion of the object. In one with anticlockwise rotation, the force acts to the right. Deflection of an object due to the Coriolis force is called the Coriolis effect. Though recognized previously by others, the mathematical expression for the Coriolis force appeared in an 1835 paper by French scientist Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis, in connection with the theory of water wheels. Early in the 20th century, the term Coriolis force began to be used in connection with meteorology.|$|E

30|$|Earlier paleomagnetic {{investigations}} on Mesozoic to Tertiary rocks {{from the}} Korean Peninsula {{suggest that the}} degrees of <b>clockwise</b> <b>rotations</b> weakened since the mid-Jurassic.

500|$|Retaining winds {{in excess}} of 120km/h (75mph), Cyclone Alby brought {{damaging}} winds {{to much of the}} region in and around Cape Leeuwin. The highest winds reached 150km/h (90mph) in Albany. In Perth, a peak gust of 130km/h (80mph) was measured, the third-highest in the city's history. The intense winds, considered unprecedented for many in the region, were attributed to the fast movement of the storm and its location in relation to land. Moving at speeds up to , winds along the northeastern edge of the storm were increased by that amount due to Alby's <b>clockwise</b> <b>rotation.</b> It also allowed for winds to cover a large area northeast of the centre, impacting many areas far from the storm. In general, rainfall was limited and generally less than this was due to the fast movement, as well as the asymmetrical structure with most of the thunderstorms south of the center.|$|E

40|$|The Tajmar anomaly is an unexplained {{acceleration}} {{observed by}} gyroscopes close to, but isolated from, rotating rings cooled to 5 K. The observed ratio between the gyroscope and ring accelerations was 3 +/- 1. 2 * 10 ^- 8 for <b>clockwise</b> <b>rotations</b> {{and about half}} this size for anticlockwise ones. Here, this anomaly is predicted using a new model that assumes that the inertial mass of the gyroscope is caused by Unruh radiation that appears as the ring and the fixed stars accelerate relative to it, and that this radiation is subject to a Hubble-scale Casimir effect. The model predicts that the sudden acceleration of the ring causes {{a slight increase in}} the inertial mass of the gyroscope, and, to conserve momentum the gyroscope must move with the ring with an acceleration ratio of 2. 67 +/- 0. 24 * 10 ^- 8 for <b>clockwise</b> <b>rotations</b> and 1. 34 +/- 0. 12 * 10 ^- 8 for anticlockwise ones, in agreement with the observations.

It was much criticized as turbulence is a phenomenon associated with disorder and would not spontaneously produce the highly ordered structure required by the hypothesis. As well, it does not provide a solution to the angular momentum problem and does not explain lunar formation nor other very basic characteristics of the Solar System.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ultimate}} {{driver of}} the stresses that cause earthquakes are the motions of the tectonic plates: material from the Earth's mantle rises at spreading centers, and moves out as plates of oceanic crust which eventually are subducted under the more buoyant plates of continental crust. Western Washington lies over the Cascadia subduction zone, where the Juan de Fuca Plate is subducting towards the east (see diagram, right). This is being obliquely overridden by the North American plate {{coming out of the}} northeast, which has formed a bend in the subducting plate and in the forearc basin above it. This bend has distorted the subducting slab into an arch that has lifted the Olympic Mountains and prevented them from subducting. For the past 50 million years or so (since the early Eocene epoch) these have been thrust by subduction up against the North Cascades ("fixed block" [...] in the diagram), which sit on the North American Plate. This forms a pocket or trough [...] what one local geologist calls the [...] "big hole between the mountains" [...] between the Cascades on the east and the Olympic Mountains and Willapa Hills on the west. This pocket is catching a stream of terranes (crustal blocks about 20 to 30km thick) which the Pacific plate is pushing up the western edge of North America, and in the process imparting a bit of <b>clockwise</b> <b>rotation</b> to southwestern Washington and most of Oregon; the result has been characterized as a train wreck. These terranes were covered by the basalts of the Crescent Formation (part of Siletzia). Folding and faulting has exposed these basalts in some places (black areas in diagram); the intervening basins have been filled by various sedimentary formations, some of which have been subsequently uplifted. Glacially deposited and shaped fill covers most of the lower elevations of Puget Sound. This is the Puget Lowland.

40|$|Deformation {{throughout}} Afar {{over the}} past 2 myr has been characterized by widespread and intense crustal fragmentation that results from inhomogeneous extension across the region. In eastern Afar, this situation has evolved to localized extension associated with the westward propagation of the Gulf of Aden/Gulf of Tadjurah seafloor spreading system into the Asal^Ghoubbet Rift. During the gradual process of rift propagation and localization, crustal blocks in eastern Afar sustained <b>clockwise</b> <b>rotations</b> of V 11 ‡. To better understand the processes of rift propagation and localization and how they affect the rest of Afar, we have collected and analyzed over 400 oriented paleomagnetic samples from 67 lava flows from central and southern Afar. Unlike eastern Afar, the mean paleomagnetic direction from central Afar indicates that vertical-axis rotations are statistically insignificant (3. 6 ‡ þ 4. 4 ‡), though small <b>clockwise</b> <b>rotations</b> (6 8 ‡) are permitted. Thus, propagation and localization in central Afar {{have not had the}} same influence in causing crustal block rotations or, perhaps more likely, have not reached the same stage of evolution as seen in eastern Afar. In addition, several of the lava flows record intriguing geomagnetic field behavior associated with polarity transitions, excursions, or large secular variation events. Interestingly, the transitional or anomalous virtual geomagnetic poles (VGPs) tend to cluster in two nearly antipodal regions, one in the northern Pacific Ocean and the other in the southwest Indian Ocean.
