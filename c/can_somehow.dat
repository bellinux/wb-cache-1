Whether these <b>can</b> <b>somehow</b> be categorized is perhaps the realm of academics, who view expression as an element of musical performance that embodies a consistently recognizable emotion, ideally causing a sympathetic emotional response in its listeners. The emotional content of musical expression is distinct from the emotional content of specific sounds (e.g., a startlingly-loud 'bang') and of learned associations (e.g., a national anthem), but can rarely be completely separated from its context.|$|E

Rahul Gairola of PopMatters wrote that while [...] "the pilot lays the usual groundwork by showing how the characters' lives are intertwined, it also demonstrates immediately the sitcom's major drawback, that the stereotypical gay character is the stand-out comic figure." [...] A reviewer for the Los Angeles Times said [...] "there's something {{not quite right}} about this show's approach to homosexuality... It {{has everything to do}} with Will's attitude. It approaches asexual, his gayness appearing to exist solely as a device to give him the moral authority to repeatedly ridicule the mincing manner of his bandanna-wearing homosexual friend, Jack, without being labeled homophobic." [...] Suite101.com's Hana Lewis thought it was [...] "regrettable" [...] that the pilot's jokes revolved [...] "solely around gay stereotypes and sexual innuendo".

Kurtzman replied that Goodman Beaver [...] "could be foolish {{and at the same time}} wise," [...] and that he [...] "innocently partakes of the bad while espousing the good." [...] He further stated that Beaver's innocent, restive, and charming nature allotted him especial creative freedom. A week later, Kurtzman wrote to Hefner, [...] "What would you think of a girl character... whom I could apply to my kind of situations?"

After the survivors are sent to the past, Faraday lures Desmond out of the Swan Dharma Initiative station, telling him to find Daniel's mother once Desmond is off the island. [...] Upon jumping further to the past, Faraday and the group are captured by the Others in 1954. The Others mistake them for military personnel and Faraday is forced to disable a hydrogen bomb labelled [...] "Jughead". During this time period, he confesses his love for Charlotte. After telling the Others that they must bury the bomb, the survivors experience another time jump. The time jumps cause Charlotte to experience nosebleeds, headaches, and double vision, and she eventually collapses.

After John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) stops the time jumps, the remaining survivors are stranded in 1974.

2500|$|Studies {{allowing}} views {{inside the}} plane of the membrane of gap junctions during formation indicated that a [...] "formation plaque" [...] formed between two cells prior to the connexins moving in. They were particle free areas when observed by TEM FF indicating very small or no transmembrane proteins were likely present. Little is known about what structures make up the formation plaque or how the formation plaque's structure changes when connexins and other components move in or out. One of the earlier studies of the formation of small gap junctions describes rows of particles and particle free halos. With larger gap junctions they were described as formation plaques with connexins moving into them. The particulate gap junctions were thought to form 4–6 hours after the formation plaques appeared. How the connexins may be transported to the plaques using tubulin is becoming clearer. [...] The formation plaque and non-connexin part of the classical gap junction plaque have been difficult for early researchers to analyse. It appears in TEM FF and thin section to be a lipid membrane domain that <b>can</b> <b>somehow</b> form a comparatively rigid barrier to other lipids and proteins. There has been indirect evidence for certain lipids being preferentially involved with the formation plaque but this cannot be considered definitive. It is difficult to envisage breaking up the membrane to analyse membrane plaques without affecting their composition. By study of connexins still in membranes lipids associated with the connexins have been studied. It was found that specific connexins tended to associate preferentially with specific phospholipids. As formation plaques precede connexins these results still give no certainty as to what is unique about the composition of plaques themselves. Other findings show connexins associate with protein scaffolds used in another junction, the zonula occludens ZO1. While this helps us understand how connexins may be moved into a gap junction formation plaque the composition of the plaque itself is still somewhat sketchy. Some headway on the in vivo composition of the gap junction plaque is being made using TEM FRIL.|$|E
