Neurons may be simple firing rate models, integrate-and-fire models, or Hodgkin-Huxley models. Plugins for other neuron models can be written and used. Hill-type muscles, motors, or servos {{can be used to}} actuate joints. Adapters between neurons and {{actuators}} are used to generate forces. Adapters between mechanical components (joints, body segments, muscles, etc.) provide feedback to the control system. Stimuli, such as voltage clamps, current clamps, and velocity clamps (for joints) can be added to design experiments. Data can be recorded from virtually every component of the system, and viewed in graphs or exported as a <b>comma</b> <b>separated</b> <b>values</b> file, making analysis easy. In addition, the user interface is entirely graphical, making it easy for beginners to use.|$|E

Other formats such as extensible markup language (XML), (JSON), or spreadsheets with header columns that can be exported as <b>comma</b> <b>separated</b> <b>values</b> (CSV) are machine readable formats.
