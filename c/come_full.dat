She started a vigorous awareness campaign which created such a public, and medical, reaction that by 1987 medical opinion had <b>come</b> <b>full</b> circle.|$|E

In contrast, the Dals have evolved into hideous, aggressive, xenophobic creatures which have encased themselves in protective metal shells and rely upon technology for survival.

25|$|A life-size {{statue of}} Wagner {{swinging}} a bat, atop a marble pedestal featuring admiring children, was forged {{by a local}} sculptor named Frank Vittor, and placed outside the left field corner gate at Forbes Field. It was dedicated on April 30, 1955, and the then-frail Wagner was well enough to attend and wave to his many fans. The Pirates have relocated twice since then, and the statue has come along with them. It now stands outside the main gate of PNC Park. The statue roughly faces {{the site of the}} Pirates' original home, Exposition Park, so in a sense Wagner has <b>come</b> <b>full</b> circle.|$|E

25|$|A {{few years}} ago there were many {{children}} and men who turned out immediately after a snow-fall, and were daily to be met during the thaw, brushing the crossings as clean as they could. For this small service many foot passengers gladly gave a few small coins, regarding the sweepers not as beggars or vagrants, but as laborers, whose hard and disagreeable work enabled well-shod people to pass neatly on their way. There has, however, been a prohibition of street sweepers...The result is that on Wednesday last...there was not one crossing on which they snow and mud did not <b>come</b> <b>full</b> two inches above the sole of a thick gaiter, and it was entirely impossible to find a single crossing {{to the opposite side}} of the avenue which could be trod without sinking to the ankle...let us have the volunteer sweepers back for the comfort of a LADY PEDESTRIAN.|$|E

500|$|For the 30th {{anniversary of}} The Joshua Tree, U2 staged a 2017 concert tour in North America, Europe, and Latin America, {{on which the}} album was played in its {{entirety}} at each show. It {{was the first time}} the group toured in promotion of an album from their back catalogue, rather than a new release. As part of the tour, U2 headlined the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee in June. In rationalising the tour, the Edge cited the 2016 US presidential election and other world events for what he judged to be renewed resonance of The Joshua Trees subject matter. He said that in looking at the record's anniversary, [...] "things have kind of <b>come</b> <b>full</b> circle, if you want. That record was written in the mid-Eighties, during the Reagan–Thatcher era of British and U.S. politics. It was a period when there was a lot of unrest. Thatcher was in the throes of trying to put down the miners' strike; there was all kinds of shenanigans going on in Central America. It feels like we're right back there in a way. I don't think any of our work has ever <b>come</b> <b>full</b> circle to that extent. It just felt like, 'Wow, these songs have a new meaning and a new resonance today that they didn't have three years ago, four years ago.'" ...|$|E

Tsamere said he chose Lille for the recording because he has a [...] "special relationship" [...] with the place. On 23 September 2013, the show was broadcast on the television channel Comédie+—it was later shown on D17 on 31 August 2014, when it was seen by 254,000 people (a 1.1% audience share).|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} in Washington, D.C., refused to approve Sherman's terms and the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton, denounced Sherman publicly, precipitating a long-lasting feud {{between the two}} men. Confusion over this issue lasted until April 26, 1865, when Johnston, ignoring instructions from President Davis, agreed to purely military terms and formally surrendered his army and all the Confederate forces in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida, in what was the largest single capitulation of the war. [...] Sherman proceeded with 60,000 of his troops to Washington, D.C., where they marched in the Grand Review of the Armies, on May 24, 1865, and were then disbanded.

The Elton John-influenced [...] "What a Catch, Donnie" [...] is a piano-driven ballad which features a string section in the background. As the song closes, it features Brendon Urie, Alexander DeLeon, Travie McCoy, Gabe Saporta, Elvis Costello and William Beckett singing parts of previous Fall Out Boy songs. According to Stump, the song contains lyrics that were important to the band and [...] "gives us the chance for this record to <b>come</b> <b>full</b> circle".

500|$|For the Vertigo Tour, {{the group}} {{originally}} considered dropping the song from their set lists, but Mullen and Clayton successfully argued against this. All 131 of the Vertigo Tour concerts featured {{a performance of}} the song, which were accompanied by the stage's LED video curtains displaying African flags. On the tour's opening night, this reminded Bono that he had originally written the lyrics in an Ethiopian village. He thought this visual accompaniment made the song <b>come</b> <b>full</b> circle, saying, [...] "And here it was, nearly twenty years later, coming back to Africa, all the stuff about parched lands and deserts making sense for the first time." [...] The song was also played at the preview screening of the band's concert film U2 3D at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. [...] At the Glastonbury Festival 2010, The Edge accompanied rock band Muse for a live cover version of the track, later playing it with U2 while headlining Glastonbury in 2011.|$|E

She called it a [...] "strong arc episode" [...] and set-up the finale, but was concerned that the strong build-up could lead to it being an anticlimax. Jamahl Epsicokhan, on his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews", gave the episode a rating of three out of four. He felt that the structure of the plot was the same as the previous episode, but that it had no story and was [...] "simply plot and action skillfully assembled — a series of events framed as goal-oriented nonstop momentum." [...] He was pleased to see an improvement in the writing of the Reed/Hayes relationship and the MACOs, although he felt the collaborative working between the two parties should have occurred earlier in the season.|$|E
