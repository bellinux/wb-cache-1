5|$|The B-2 and C-2, {{introduced}} in 1949, allowed vibrato to be enabled or disabled on each manual separately. In 1954, the B-3 and C-3 models were introduced {{with the additional}} harmonic percussion feature.

5|$|In the Earth's atmosphere, the {{concentration}} of helium by volume is only 5.2 parts per million. The concentration is low and fairly constant despite the <b>continuous</b> <b>production</b> of new helium because most helium in the Earth's atmosphere escapes into space by several processes.

5|$|The Panzer IV saw {{service in}} all combat theaters {{involving}} Germany {{and was the}} only German tank to remain in <b>continuous</b> <b>production</b> throughout the war. Upgrades and design modifications, intended to counter new threats, extended its service life. Generally, these involved increasing the Panzer IV's armor protection or upgrading its weapons, although during {{the last months of}} the war, with Germany's pressing need for rapid replacement of losses, design changes also included simplifications to speed up the manufacturing process.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{technical}} complexity, neither {{device was}} revolutionary {{by the standards}} of the time. However, the total vision of their design was. Evans was attempting a radical shift in thinking about the manufacturing process, treating it as a continuous integrated whole rather than a series of isolated processes. Thus, manufacturing could be a fully automated production line. The missing link was materials handling, and Evans's mill designs sought to feed materials continuously through a system without the need for any human intervention. This was the first fully automated industrial process, and the idea of <b>continuous</b> <b>production</b> was proved to be a critical ingredient of the industrial revolution, and would ultimately lay the foundation for modern mass production.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Manufacturing {{nowadays}} {{is conducted}} {{in an environment}} with prevalently changing conditions. This requires appropriate strategies and systems {{in order to remain}} responsive and competitive. Referring to <b>continuous</b> flow <b>production,</b> it is important to focus on cost effectiveness without affecting product quality. Thus, next generation manufacturing systems will {{need to be able to}} deal with these requirements. One promising approach to achieve this goal is to increase autonomy of manufacturing systems through software agents. Combined with radio-frequency identification (RFID), agent technology forms a powerful tool to enhance both existing and prospective manufacturing systems. This paper proposes an outline of an autonomous control concept based on software agents for distributed manufacturing systems in <b>continuous</b> flow <b>production.</b> Agents and RFID are the groundwork of the concept presented here. The paper provides an overview about both technologies and discusses possibilities on how to combine software agents with RFID for beneficial use in manufacturing. Building on that knowledge, a concept outline with focus on <b>continuous</b> flow <b>production</b> is presented, which consists of distributed agentbased services implemented using Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and WS-Discovery.

5|$|The Supermarine Spitfire is a British single-seat fighter {{aircraft}} {{that was used}} by the Royal Air Force and many other Allied countries before, during and after World War II. The Spitfire was built in many variants, using several wing configurations, and was produced in greater numbers than any other British aircraft. It was also the only British fighter to be in <b>continuous</b> <b>production</b> throughout the war. The Spitfire continues to be popular among enthusiasts; about 54 remain airworthy, while many more are static exhibits in aviation museums throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|Poehler became {{pregnant}} {{during the latter}} half of the season, with her baby due in the summer or early fall of 2010. The Parks and Recreation producers decided not to write the pregnancy into the show, so they decided to enter into a <b>continuous</b> <b>production</b> after the season ended to bank episodes for the third season. Six season three episodes were filmed in this fashion. However, in May 2010, NBC announced the third season of Parks and Recreation was being moved to an undisclosed midseason premiere date to allow the network's new comedy, Outsourced, to run in the Thursday two-hour comedy schedule block. NBC chief executive officer Jeff Gaspin said this move was not a reflection on Parks and Recreation, and suggested the extended hiatus would not only have no effect on the show's momentum, but could actually build anticipation for its eventual return. In November 2010, it was announced Parks and Recreation would return to a 9:30p.m. Thursday timeslot effective January 20, 2011.|$|E
5|$|The Derwent Valley is {{considered}} {{the birthplace of the}} factory system. The machines developed in the Derwent Valley such as the water frame allowed <b>continuous</b> <b>production.</b> Richard Arkwright's Cromford Mill and the associated workers' settlement provided a template for industrial communities, not just in the valley but internationally. The reason a settlement was built contemporaneously with Cromford Mill was to provide housing for the workers; the only way to secure the labour the mill required was if homes were provided for the labourers and their families. The success of Arkwright's model lead to other industrialists copying him. Entrepreneurs such as Peter Nightingale, Jedediah Strutt and Thomas Evans founded the settlements of Belper, Milford, and Darley Abbey within the Derwent Valley for their employees. As well as the economic standpoint of ensuring a supply of labour, the industrialists were also concerned for their employees and families and acted {{out of a sense of}} paternalism.|$|E

5|$|The inner {{boundary}} of the debris disk was estimated at 11″±2″, or 70–100AU. The disk of dust is produced as radiation pressure from Vega pushes debris from collisions of larger objects outward. However, <b>continuous</b> <b>production</b> {{of the amount of}} dust observed over the course of Vega's lifetime would require an enormous starting mass—estimated as hundreds of times the mass of Jupiter. Hence it is {{more likely to have been}} produced as the result of a relatively recent breakup of a moderate-sized (or larger) comet or asteroid, which then further fragmented as the result of collisions between the smaller components and other bodies. This dusty disk would be relatively young on the time scale of the star's age, and it will eventually be removed unless other collision events supply more dust.|$|E
