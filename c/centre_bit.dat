50|$|The Northern Elbe {{passes the}} Elbe Philharmonic Hall and is then crossed under {{by the old}} Elbe Tunnel (Alter Elbtunnel), both in Hamburg's city <b>centre.</b> A <b>bit</b> more {{downstream}} the Low Elbe's two main anabranches Northern Elbe and the Köhlbrand reunite south of Altona-Altstadt, a locality of Hamburg. Right after both anabranches reunited the Low Elbe is passed under by the New Elbe Tunnel (Neuer Elbtunnel), the last structural road link crossing the river before the North Sea. At the bay Mühlenberger Loch in Hamburg at kilometre 634, the Northern Elbe and the Southern Elbe (here now the cut-off meander Old Southern Elbe) used to reunite, {{which is why the}} bay is seen as the starting point of the Lower Elbe (Niederelbe). Leaving the city-state the Lower Elbe then passes between Holstein and the Elbe-Weser Triangle with Stade until it flows into the North Sea at Cuxhaven. Near its mouth it passes the entrance to the Kiel Canal at Brunsbüttel before it debouches into the North Sea.|$|R

60|$|As {{soon as the}} two men {{had taken}} their stations, and began to look about them, a feeling of awe mingled with their curiosity. Truly, the scene was one so very {{remarkable}} and imposing that it might have filled more intellectual and better fortified minds with some such sensation. The fire was by no means large, nor was it particularly bright; but sufficient to cast a dim light on the objects within reach of its rays. It was in the precise <b>centre</b> of a <b>bit</b> of bottom land of about half an acre in extent, which was so formed and surrounded, as to have something of the appearance of the arena of a large amphitheatre. There was one break in the encircling rise of ground, it is true, and that was at a spot directly opposite the station of le Bourdon and his companion, where the rill which flowed from the spring found a passage out toward the more open ground. Branches shaded most of the mound, but the arena itself was totally free from all vegetation but that which covered the dense and beautiful sward with which it was carpeted. Such is {{a brief description of the}} natural accessories of this remarkable scene.|$|R
40|$|By 1990 the {{art world}} was looking for new fields of interest. Feminism and postroodernism were tired, and postcolonialism was the rising star. So New York 2 ̆ 7 s New Museum of Contemporary Art {{published}} an anthology called Out. There, which sought to throw light on margmallsed artists who were somewhere out there beyond the horizon of Manhattan. 2 ̆ 7 Recognising that the very title of the anthology conveniently reinstated New York as the fountainhead of not just (post) modernism but also all who were marginalised by and resisted It, Mosquera and Fisher have titled their recent anthology Over Here Here 2 ̆ 7 s the rub. Not only does Over There, like a call for attention, reinscribe a <b>centre</b> for elsewhere, <b>bit</b> it is also published by the same New York New Museum of Contemporary Art. I guess that once the searchlight is pointed out there, calls of 2 ̆ 7 over there 2 ̆ 7 will inevidently be heard. The publication in the past half-dozen years of readers and general introductions to postcolonialism suggests that, having also run its course, postcolonialism now can be inscribed into the grand tradition of Western critical theory and safely taught in our tertiary institutions. However, this may premature. Three recent anthologies, Third Text Reader, Complex Entanglements and Over Here, attempt to take postcolonial criticism forward rather than assess its achievements. Despite several attempts by the old Atlantic centres of modernity to reassert themselves {{towards the end of}} the millennium (London being the most notable), Over Here and Complex Entanglements (which concern this review) suggest that not much is on the horizon to challenge postcolonialism. The new mantra of globalisation that dominates these two anthologies is an outcome and continuation of postcolonial debate...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the {{investigation}} of a digital absolute posi- tion-detection system, {{which is based on}} a position-information carrier (i. e. a magnetic tape) with one single code track on the one hand, and an array of magnetoresistive sensors for the detection of the information on the other. The sensor array consists of a permalloy (Ni 0. 81 Fe 0. 19) strip which is electrically sub-divided into adjacent sensor elements by means of cross- contact leads (Mo-Al). The sensor response on a magnetic field in the plane of the strip {{is a result of the}} anisotropic magnetoresistance effect in thin ferromagnetic films. The permalloy strip has a thickness of about 50 nm and a width in the range of 10 to 30 um. The central positions of the sensor elements are located at mutual distances of 50 to 200 um, which is dependent on the bit period in the magnetic tape. The plane of the sensor strip is positioned perpendicular to the magnetic-tape plane. The strip axis and direction of movement of the permalloy strip are lengthways along the magnetic tape. This tape is recorded with a so-called pseudo-random bit pattern, having the property that each arbitrary selected set of n adjacent bits is unique. Depending on the actual position of the sensor head, a special bit combination is detected by a sensor array con- sisting of n elements. This digital word can be decoded to a position coordi- nate. The thesis reports on the feasibility of the position-detection system on the basis of experiments with specially developed measurement heads. In introduc- tory observations the backgrounds, the theory and the design choices come up for discussion. Attention is paid to the modelling of the magnetization distribution in the permalloy strip, which is excited by homogeneous or inhomogeneous magnetic fields. Next the conversion of the magnetization distribution into magnetoresistance and so-called planar-Hall voltages is treated, resulting in a clear choice for the application of the former in a position-detector array. The potentialities of a silicon Hall-sensor array as an alternative for permalloy sensors is considered. Next the basic set-up of a complete position-detection system is discussed, including the generation of the applied position code, as well as methods to cope with problems like the sensor arrays being non-ideally positioned with respect to the <b>bit</b> <b>centres</b> and the potentialities of the application of interpolation schemes. For practical reasons commercially available, longitudinally magnetized tapes are used as a position-data carrier in an experimental system. In view of the computations of the sensor behaviour in the stray field of such a tape, the foundations of a computer simulation model are discussed, resulting in both a practical "simple" model and a more-difficult sophisticated model. Next the details of the realized sensor-chip design are outlined. The realization of the sensor head has been a very demanding activity of this research project; two subjects are discussed in detail. First the realization of the required low interface-resistivity value between permalloy and conduc- tor film is discussed. Second the positioning of the sensor strip at the very edge of the substrate (distance in the order of micrometers) is described. The measurements chapter describes the applied measurement equipment, the various properties and dimensions of the prototype sensor structures and the set-up of the actually performed measurements, i. e. the registration of the sensor-element responses in the stray fields of magnetic tapes. The results are evaluated for sensor elements and tapes with various properties, in the light of the so-called detection distances which are determined with the help of "eye patterns" composed on the basis of worst-case responses. The lower limit of the bit period is found to be in the order of a few hundred micro- meters. Conclusions are first addressed to the performance of the computer model. It is found that the simple simulation model results in reasonably accurate approximations of the sensor responses and detection distances, if the computations are carried out for relatively small values (t ~ 10 um) of the separation between the sensor strip and the magnetic-tape surface. A careful extension of the range of the experimental parameters in the computer model does not result in essentially better computed figures for the minimum bit period (i. e. resolution) of the position-detection system: Prospects of improved performances could possibly arise by the introduction of an all- embracing second design round. It is noted that the final resolution of the position-detection system, being in the order of magnitude of 100 um, can be improved by a factor of 10 to 100 with the application of interpolation techniques. In this case the increase of the accuracy which, in the first instance, is in the order of magnitude of the bit period, will be dependent on the actual quality of these techniques. Finally, the performance of a position detection system based on the alternative silicon-Hall technology is estimated to be of the same order as the permalloy-based version. In an appendix attention is paid to measurement techniques which, based on magnetoresistance sensors, at the time were applied for analysis of the form and magnitude of the compact head field of recording write heads. The utilization of the discussed absolute position-detection system should be based on the possibilities to economically realize a (mass) product with relatively good performance with respect to the established (mostly optical) systems. Having this aim in view, a special-purpose signal-processing chip should be developed, among other things, and integrated with the thin-film sensor structure. However, extensive and multidisciplinar activities of this kind are found to form a certain barrier for the utilization of the design...|$|R
