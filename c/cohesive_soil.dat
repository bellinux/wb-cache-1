50|$|A river bank can {{be divided}} into three zones: Toe zone, bank zone, and overbank area. The toe zone is the area which is most {{susceptible}} to erosion. Because it is located in between the ordinary water level and the low water level, it is strongly affected by currents and erosional events. The bank zone is above the ordinary high water level, but can still be effected periodically by currents, and gets the most human and animal traffic. The overbank area is inland of both the toe and bank zones, and can be classified as either a floodplain or a bluff, depending on its slope. A river bank will respond to erosional activity based on the characteristics of the bank material. The most common type of bank is a stratified or interstratified bank, which consists of cohesionless layers interbedded with cohesive layers. If the <b>cohesive</b> <b>soil</b> is at the toe of the bank, it will control the retreat rate of the overlying layer. If the cohesionless soil is at the toe of the bank, these layers are not protected by the layers of <b>cohesive</b> <b>soil.</b> A Bedrock bank is usually very stable and will experience gradual erosion. A cohesive bank is highly susceptible to erosion in times of lowering water levels due to its low permeability. Failures in cohesive soils will be in rotational or planar failure surfaces, while in non-cohesive soils failures will be in an avalanche fashion.|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, the European Commission tabled a {{proposal}} to the European Parliament to establish a framework for soil protection within the union. Soil is recognised as a non-renewable resource because of its slow formation process. However—unlike other non-renewable resources, such as coal, that have explicit policies governing extraction methods, trading, and consumption in the EU—soil governance is contained within the contexts of environmental policies and regulation on various entities of the biosphere. The draft policy recognised that soil governance had been [...] "scattered" [...] in EU legislation, and lacked a cohesive isolated framework, therefore governance {{and management of the}} same resource was open to interpretation depending on the main resource and industry policy in question. The policy sought to unify the [...] "scattered" [...] regulations because they lacked the mandate to [...] "identify and cover all soil threats". This view was supported by extensive consultation between stakeholders and the European commission that started in February 2003, and saw member states convey their support for a framework based on regional action in 2004. The framework was developed as a directive to member states; this form of legislation allows interpretation by stakeholders at national and local levels, and between networks thus complying with the subsidiarity principle. The principle provides that EU political decisions must be implemented at [...] "the lowest possible administrative and political level, and as close to the citizens as possible", unless in areas where action by individual countries is insufficient. It is under this principle that member states rejected the proposal to establish a framework for soil protection as the proposal argued that member states are unable to effectively monitor and manage their soils. Inconsistencies in national soil governance strategies and, classification and treatment of contaminants would disable the objectives of the proposal because of the complexities of trans-border soil pollution and management. Furthermore, soil degradation and mismanagement affects other environmental areas, and industries governed through EU legislation such as water, biodiversity, and food production, thus it was deemed appropriate to have uniform legislation across all entities. Member states argued that soil management should not be negotiated at the European Regional level as they already had strong domestic policies regulating soil usage and management, therefore focus should be directed at strengthening local policies and regulatory institution. Consequently, the EU does not have a <b>cohesive</b> <b>soil</b> governance policy and relies on environmental policies, and non-renewable resource policies and legislations of member states to guide utilisation, management and regulate pollutants of the soil.|$|E

40|$|Kaliakin, VictorConstitutive {{models have}} been {{developed}} to simulate the soil response under different loading conditions. Within the wide spectrum of these conditions, earthquakes have been of interest to the research community worldwide. Traditionally, researchers have largely focused on simulating the response of cohesionless soils. By contrast, far less research has been done on simulating the response of <b>cohesive</b> <b>soils</b> subjected to cyclic loading. Consequently, certain issues associated with the simulation of such response are still being addressed. A review of experimental results has identified several key characteristics of cyclically loaded <b>cohesive</b> <b>soils</b> that any rational mathematical simulation must account for. Accordingly, the scope of this dissertation is the development of an improved and generalized elastoplastic bounding surface model that is suitable for simulating the general response of <b>cohesive</b> <b>soils,</b> with emphasis on cyclic loading. In its most general form, the Generalized Bounding Surface Model (GBS-Model) for <b>cohesive</b> <b>soils</b> is a fully three-dimensional, time-dependent model that accounts for both inherent and stress induced anisotropy. The rotational hardening law and the shape hardening function were chosen after a thorough review of past modeling practices; in both cases, the selected functional form simplified earlier versions of the bounding surface model without compromising the GBS-Model's predictive capabilities. In addition, to better simulate the behavior of <b>cohesive</b> <b>soils</b> exhibiting softening, the model employs a non-associative flow rule. To more accurately simulate the behavior of <b>cohesive</b> <b>soils</b> subjected to cyclic loading, the model uses a robust general methodology for locating the projection center at any point in stress invariant space, within or on the bounding surface, associated with the radial mapping rule that results in a Lode angle dependency not only of the plastic potential surface but of the bounding surface as well. If all of the aforementioned features of the GBS-Model are not deemed necessary for the simulation of a particular soil and boundary conditions, then the model can be suitably simplified making it appropriate for adaptive model simulations that can be tailored (through suitable simplifications) to the specific nature of a boundary value problem. For instance, the GBS-Model can be adaptively changed from a complex and more accurate version (e. g., anisotropic with non-associative flow rule) to a simpler one (e. g., isotropic with associative flow rule); thus, minimizing errors and increasing numerical efficiency, thereby reducing computational cost. Finally, a wide range of <b>cohesive</b> <b>soils</b> is used to compare experimental results with the numerical simulations. Besides, a sensitivity analysis, showing how the new parameters influence the simulations, is also presented. University of Delaware, Department of Civil and Environmental EngineeringPh. D...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if soil strength controlled the compression of soils with low bulk density. Four soils were selected for this evaluation. Three of these were andic soils with low bulk density and the fourth soil was a more dense, <b>cohesive</b> <b>soil.</b> Undisturbed samples of saturated and partly saturated soil were compressed in a one-dimensional consolidation test apparatus. Measurements with separate samples were at one of 7 normal stresses between 0. 033 and 1. 96 MPa. Shear strength of saturated soil was measured in direct shear tests. Primary consolidation of saturated soil was completed in less than one minute at all normal stresses. Shear stress and bulk density increased continuously during shear strain. The compression index of the <b>cohesive</b> <b>soil</b> was significantly larger (p< 0. 05) than that of the andic soils. The shear strength of andic soils (average cohesion intercept of 0. 016 MPa and friction angle of 33. 3 °) was significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than the <b>cohesive</b> <b>soil</b> (cohesion intercept of 0. 028 MPa and friction angle of 28. 9 °). When saturated, the <b>cohesive</b> <b>soil</b> was more compressible than the andic soils because of lower soil strength. A nonlinear model of soil compression was developed that accurately predicted the compressed density of saturated and partly saturated soil as a function of normal stress, initial bulk density of undisturbed samples, and degree of saturation. As degree of saturation decreased, the compressibility of the <b>cohesive</b> <b>soil</b> decreased more rapidly than it did for the andic soils. As a result, bulk density of dry <b>cohesive</b> <b>soil</b> increased less than it did for dry andic soils. Differences in the compressibility of soils were attributed to texture and clay mineralogy. The differences in the compressibility of these soils were much smaller than were the differences in bulk density. Decreasing water content affected the compressibility of the <b>cohesive</b> <b>soil</b> more than it affected the andic soils. Because soil strength controls the compressibility of these forest soils regardless of bulk density, it will also determine the susceptibility of soils to compaction by machines...|$|E
