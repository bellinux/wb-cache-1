5|$|Chocolate {{has been}} made in Switzerland since the 18th century but it gained its {{reputation}} {{at the end of the}} 19th century with the invention of modern techniques such as <b>conching</b> and tempering which enabled its production on a high quality level. Also a breakthrough was the invention of solid milk chocolate in 1875 by Daniel Peter. The Swiss are the world's largest consumers of chocolate.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s Harana and Kundiman {{became more}} {{mainstream}} after performers such as Atang de la Rama, Jovita Fuentes, <b>Conching</b> Rosal, Sylvia La Torre and Ruben Tagalog introduced {{them to a}} wider audience.|$|E
25|$|The texture is also heavily {{influenced}} by processing, specifically <b>conching</b> (see below). The more expensive chocolate tends to be processed longer and thus have a smoother texture and mouthfeel, regardless of whether emulsifying agents are added.|$|E

2500|$|The {{penultimate}} {{process is}} called <b>conching.</b> A conche is a container filled with metal beads, which act as grinders. The refined and blended chocolate mass {{is kept in}} a liquid state by frictional heat. Chocolate prior to <b>conching</b> has an uneven and gritty texture. The <b>conching</b> process produces cocoa and sugar particles smaller than the tongue can detect, hence the smooth feel in the mouth. The length of the <b>conching</b> process determines the final smoothness {{and quality of the}} chocolate. High-quality chocolate is conched for about 72hours, and lesser grades about four to six hours. After the process is complete, the chocolate mass is stored in tanks heated to about [...] until final processing.|$|E
2500|$|New {{processes}} that sped {{the production of}} chocolate emerged early in the Industrial Revolution. In 1815, Dutch chemist Coenraad van Houten introduced alkaline salts to chocolate, which reduced its bitterness. A few years thereafter, in 1828, he created a press to remove about half the natural fat (cocoa butter or cacao butter) from chocolate liquor, which made chocolate both cheaper to produce and more consistent in quality. This innovation introduced the modern era of chocolate. Known as [...] "Dutch cocoa", this machine-pressed chocolate {{was instrumental in the}} transformation of chocolate to its solid form when, in 1847, Joseph Fry learned to make chocolate moldable by adding back melted cacao butter. Milk had sometimes been used as an addition to chocolate beverages since the mid-17th century, but in 1875 Daniel Peter invented milk chocolate by mixing a powdered milk developed by Henri Nestl√© with the liquor. In 1879, the texture and taste of chocolate was further improved when Rudolphe Lindt invented the <b>conching</b> machine.|$|E

50|$|Throughout Mesoamerican history, <b>conch</b> {{trumpets}} were used, {{often in}} a ritual context (see figure). In Ancient Maya art, such <b>conches</b> were often decorated with ancestral images; scenes painted on vases show hunters and hunting deities blowing the <b>conch</b> trumpet. Quechua (Inca descendents) and Warao still use the <b>conch.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fishing, as an {{economic}} activity, and making a living from the sea, {{is an important part}} of <b>conch</b> culture. Sponge-diving, <b>conch</b> diving, crabbing, lobstering and other commercial fishing have been important parts of <b>conch</b> culture. Commercial fishing is now less important to <b>conch</b> culture than it has been in the past, and recreational fishing is more important, as some <b>conchs</b> now make their livings from charter fishing and other tourism-related businesses.|$|R

25|$|<b>Conch</b> is most {{indigenous}} to The Bahamas, and is typically served in fritter, salad, and soup forms. In addition to The Bahamas, <b>conch</b> is also eaten in the West Indies (Jamaica in particular); locals in Jamaica eat <b>conch</b> in soups, stews and curries.

In Puerto Rico, <b>conch</b> is served as a ceviche, often called ensalada de carrucho (<b>conch</b> salad), consisting of raw <b>conch</b> marinated in lime juice, olive oil, vinegar, garlic, green peppers, and onions.

50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century Swiss Chocolate started to spread abroad. Closely linked to this was the {{invention}} of Milk Chocolate by Daniel Peter in Vevey and the invention of the <b>conching</b> by Rodolphe Lindt.|$|E
