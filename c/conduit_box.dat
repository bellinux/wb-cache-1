50|$|Some {{types of}} conduit are {{approved}} for direct encasement in concrete. This {{is commonly used}} in commercial buildings to allow electrical and communication outlets to be installed {{in the middle of}} large open areas. For example, retail display cases and open-office areas use floor-mounted <b>conduit</b> <b>boxes</b> to connect power and communications cables.|$|R
40|$|Outsourcing is a {{practice}} that can result in economic and competitive advantages if its application is evaluated taking into account different strategic alternatives, such as internal production. This paper proposes {{the use of a}} hybrid approach of simulation and optimization for analyzing the internalization of finishing operations for aluminum <b>conduit</b> <b>boxes.</b> The goal is to find the optimal amount of product batches that should be internally processed in order to meet 100 % of the demand. The optimization considers the machinery’s capacity as a major constraint, while the simulation adds stochasticity to the plant model to ensure production plan reliability. The results show that, when using the hybrid approach, the rate of compliance with customer demand increased and approached the goal at each iteration of the method, with a low impact on the final cost...|$|R
50|$|Today, Graybar {{operates}} {{a network of}} more than 260 locations throughout the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico as well as authorized agents around the world. Graybar Electric Company, Inc. is engaged {{in the distribution of}} electrical, communications and data networking products and the provision of related supply services primarily to electrical and comm/data contractors, industrial plants, federal, state and local governments, commercial users, telephone companies and power utilities in North America. All the products Graybar sells are purchased from others. The products distributed by the company consist primarily of wire and cable, lighting fixtures, power distribution equipment, comm/data products for wide and local area networks, <b>conduit,</b> <b>boxes</b> and fittings, wiring devices, motor controls, industrial automation, lamps, industrial enclosures, tools and test equipment, station apparatus, fuses and transformers.|$|R
40|$|This {{specification}} {{covers the}} general workmanship requirements {{and procedures for}} the complete installation and assembly of electrical ground support equipment (EGSE) such as terminal distributors, junction <b>boxes,</b> <b>conduit</b> and fittings, cable trays and accessories, interconnecting cables (including routing requirements), motor-control equipment, and necessary hardware as specified by the applicable contract and drawings...|$|R
50|$|Window {{and door}} {{openings}} are cast {{into the walls}} at the manufacturing plant {{as part of the}} fabrication process. In many applications, electrical and telecommunications <b>conduit</b> and <b>boxes</b> are cast directly into the panels in the specified locations. In some applications, utilities, plumbing and even heating components have been cast into the panels to reduce on-site construction time. The carpenters, electricians and plumbers do need to make some slight adjustments when first becoming familiar with some of the unique aspects of the wall panels. However, they still perform most of their job duties in the manner to which they are accustomed.|$|R
5000|$|Many systems used in {{telecommunications}} use an extra-low voltage [...] "common battery" [...] 48 V DC power, {{because it}} has less restrictive safety regulations, such as being installed in <b>conduit</b> and junction <b>boxes.</b> DC has typically been the dominant power source for telecommunications, and AC has typically been the dominant source for computers and servers.|$|R
50|$|The {{primary reason}} {{for the use of}} {{isolated}} grounds (IG) is to provide a noise-free ground return, separate from the equipment grounding (EG) return. The EG circuit includes all of the metal <b>conduit,</b> outlet <b>boxes,</b> and metal enclosures that contain the wiring and must be grounded to provide a safe return path in case of fault currents. The IG provides an insulated, separate ground path for the ground reference in electronic equipment, such as computers, hospital equipment, and audio equipment. IG does not break ground loops, which can damage equipment like computers, printers, etc.. Interconnected computer equipment often benefits from single-point grounding. IG is only used with special equipment that require it. The IG is typically insulated and separate {{all the way back to}} the point of earth grounding rod outside of the building. The IG is NOT connected neutral or any other. Due to the installation of a separate, insulated conductor and the associated special outlets required, IG circuits are more expensive to install than standard power circuits.|$|R
5000|$|The game runs at 48 kHz audio. On July 29, 2010, Sega {{revealed}} <b>Conduit</b> 2s <b>box</b> art. In September 2010 it {{was reported}} that the game would be delayed until Q1 2011 and supports Classic Controller input. In an attempt to improve Conduit 2s story over the first game High Voltage Software hired novelist Matt Forbeck and Jason Blair, the writer of the video games Borderlands and Prey, to pen the games script. In an interview with Keith Hladik, it was stated that all voice actors from the first game would not be returning but the new voice actors have done [...] "a fantastic job making our characters come to life." [...] Agent Michael Ford is now voiced by voice actor Jon St. John, who is best known for providing the voice for Duke Nukem. Conduit 2 was originally compatible with the Wii Speak peripheral as The Conduit was, but functionality of the device was removed from the title at the insistence of Nintendo. Wii Speak support was dropped as it was incompatible with the PDP Headbanger headset, which support was opted for instead for its lower latency and better sound quality. Motion controls were originally planned to be used for opening doors and flicking switches, but eventually this feature was removed from the game.|$|R
50|$|The hammer {{action is}} {{provided}} by two cam plates that make the chuck rapidly pulse forward and backward as the drill spins on its axis. This pulsing (hammering) action is measured in Blows Per Minute (BPM) with 10,000 or more BPMs being common. Because the combined mass of the chuck and bit is {{comparable to that of}} the body of the drill, the energy transfer is inefficient and can sometimes make it difficult for larger bits to penetrate harder materials such as poured concrete. The operator experiences considerable vibration, and the cams are generally made from hardened steel to avoid them wearing out quickly. In practice, drills are restricted to standard masonry bits up to 13 mm (1/2 inch) in diameter. A typical application for a hammer drill is installing electrical <b>boxes,</b> <b>conduit</b> straps or shelves in concrete.|$|R
40|$|The GIS Fiber Optics Asset Management System (GFOAMS) was {{developed}} for the City of El Paso, to manage the public fiber optics infrastructure. Using a map-driven interface, the GFOAMS is composed of three modules: inventory, documents, and images. Its interactive multilayer data structure contains information for Junction <b>Boxes,</b> <b>Conduit</b> Runs, and Cables for twelve fiber optic systems across the city. The fiber optics network stored in the GFOAMS connects city buildings and facilities such as police departments, fire departments, municipal courts, health administration building, public transportation facilities/Sun Metro, libraries and others. Applications of the GFOAMS include tools to easy access fiber optics detailed information, conduct proximity infrastructure buffer analysis, and generate what-if 2 ̆ 2 smart maps 2 ̆ 2 to support decision analysis. The GFOAMS is now fully implemented and {{has been used for}} organizing daily interventions, managing leasable fiber optics Conduits, and planning new fiber optics developments. Managing the fiber optics assets effectively for the City of El Paso is crucial {{to keep up with the}} new needs of broadband, and communications. This thesis covers the most relevant aspects of the developed GFOAMS framework, placing it in the asset management context and background and detailing usage possibilities and applications. ...|$|R
