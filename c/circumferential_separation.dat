40|$|There was {{a landing}} {{incidence}} to an aircraft wherein the tyre got burst. Laboratory examination {{revealed that the}} tyre got punctured during landing resulting in deflation of the tyre. Subsequently, the rolling of the flattened tyre resulted in excessive crushing load on the sidewalls. This {{in conjunction with the}} heat generated was responsible for the <b>circumferential</b> <b>separation</b> of the crown from the sidewalls close to the bead. There were no evidences to suggest that it was a sudden tyre burst. Instead, it appears that the deflation of the tyre was slow after the occurrence of puncture. Evidences also suggest that the foreign debris that caused the puncture was slender and sharp object with a head such as seen in case of a nail or a screw or a rivet. No deterioration in the tyre material and/or abnormal wear was responsible for the failure...|$|E
40|$|A new {{technique}} is reported for calculating the entire flow field on spherically blunted cones at high angles of attack and high laminar Reynolds numbers. An approximate system of parabolic equations {{obtained from the}} steady Navier-Stokes equations by assuming the viscous, streamwise derivative terms are small compared to the viscous normal and circumferential derivatives {{is the basis of}} the calculations. These equations are valid for both the inviscid and viscous regions, including the <b>circumferential</b> <b>separation</b> zone that develops on the leeward side at high angles of attack. Two different methods are used to obtain the initial conditions for these equations at the sphere cone tangency plane. For small nose Reynolds numbers, an axisymmetric merged layer solution around a sphere is rotated to provide a three-dimensional initial plane of data. For large nose Reynolds numbers, the nose region is solved using an inviscid, three dimensional time dependent solution combined with a boundary layer solution for the viscous flow. The computed flowfield including the leeward separation region is described and compared with data for a 7 deg half angle cone at 10 deg angle of attack, and a blunt 15 deg half angle cone at 15 deg angle of attack...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Bearingless motors offer {{contactless}} levitation and rotation {{through a}} hermitically closed process chamber and sat-isfy {{the increasing demand}} for ultra high purity spin processes in chemical, biochemical and semiconductor industry. Most of these processes require a high acceleration capability for minimal proc-ess times and a large air gap in order to fit in a mechanical stable chamber wall. The combination of these requirements possibly causes saturation effect issues that may occur depending on the specific drive claw shape. In this paper, saturation effects which reduce the effective torque of the motor are investigated for two commonly known drive claw shapes. The investigations are exem-plarily carried out for the Bearingless 2 -Level Motor (B 2 M), since it allows the isolated examination of saturation effects caused by the drive flux due to the axial and <b>circumferential</b> <b>separation</b> of the bearing and drive units. The paper visualizes the flux density distribution and the flux trajectory change at the presence of saturation for the presented drive claw shapes by means of 3 D fi-nite element simulations. One drive claw type {{is found to be}} the more applicable concept and is subsequently optimized with re-spect to maximum torque by variation of the drive claw width. Finally, the superior performance of the designed claw is proven by the comparison of simulation results with measurement data of an experimental prototype. I...|$|E
40|$|Laminar heating {{distributions}} {{have been}} {{measured on a}} 1. 9 percent scale model of a generic aeroassisted vehicle taking {{the shape of a}} spherically blunted, 13 -deg/ 7 -deg biconic whose forecone section is bent upward (by 7 deg) to furnish self-trim capability at a 20 -deg angle-of-attack. The results thus obtained were compared with data gathered for a straight biconic. While no Reynolds number effect on heating was noted on the windward side of the forecone, the opposite was true of the leeward side, where a Reynolds number increase caused <b>circumferential</b> flow <b>separation</b> at lower angles of attack. Generally, windward heating was predicted to within 10 percent with a computer code solving the steady, three-dimensional parabolized Navier-Stokes equations...|$|R
40|$|An {{inviscid}} discrete vortex model, {{with newly}} derived expressions for the tangential velocity imposed at the separation points, {{is used to}} investigate the symmetric and asymmetric vortex separation on cones and tangent ogives. The <b>circumferential</b> locations of <b>separation</b> are taken from experimental data. Based on a slender body theory, the resulting simultaneous nonlinear algebraic equations in a cross-flow plane are solved with Broyden's modified Newton-Raphson method. Total force coefficients are obtained through momentum principle with new expressions for nonconical flow. It is shown through the method of function deflation that multiple solutions exist at large enough angles of attack, even with symmetric separation points. These additional solutions are asymmetric in vortex separation and produce side force coefficients which agree well with data for cones and tangent ogives...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis investigates the impact of upstream duct convolution on the plume development for high speed jets. In particular, investigations are carried out into an unconventional aero-engine exhaust systems comprised of a modified convergent-divergent rectangular nozzle where the converging section of the nozzle includes an S-bend in the duct. The motivation for this work comes from both the military and civilian sectors of the aerospace industry. The growing interest into highly efficient engines in the civilian sector and increasing complexities involved in stealth technologies for military applications has led to new design constraints on aero-engine exhaust systems that require further research into flows through more complex duct geometries. Due {{to a lack of}} experimental data into this area in the open literature validation studies are undertaken into flows through an S-bend duct and exhaust plume development from a rectangular convergent-divergent nozzle. The validation work is simulated using RANS CFD with common industrial turbulence models as well as LES with artificial inlet conditions. Subsequently, a CFD investigation into three unconventional aero-engine exhaust systems, with over-expanded conditions, with differing angles of curvature across the converging S-bend is undertaken using both RANS and LES methodologies governed by the validation work. As the curvature of the S-bend was increased {{it was found that the}} thrust and effective NPR both decrease. Whilst these changes were within acceptable levels (with some optimisation) for a circumferential extent of up to 53. 1 the losses became prohibitive large at extents. For the ducts with a greater <b>circumferential</b> extents <b>separation</b> was seen to occur at the throat of the nozzle; this changes the design parameters of the nozzle leading to a higher Mach number and could potentially be harnessed to improve performance of the engine creating a `variable throat' nozzle. The impact of using different numerical solvers to simulate the flow through an unconventional aero-engine exhaust system has also been considered. The use of LES has shown that the octagonal, hexahedral and trapezoidal shapes initially observed in the development of the plumes of the RANS cases are likely to be an artifact caused by the RANS solver, as would the transverse total pressure gradients observed in the RANS cases at the nozzle exit as they are both absent from all of the LES results. Likewise the implementation of realistic inlet conditions has a significant impact on the development of the plume, particularly in the length of the potential core and the number of shock cells...|$|R
40|$|After re-warming to normothermia, {{the patient}} is weaned from CPB. COMMENT Inadequate organ {{perfusion}} {{is one of the}} major problems in patients presenting with AADA. Prompt establishment of ante-grade systemic perfusion may prevent further dissection, organ malperfusion and cerebral embolization [2]. Instant antegrade perfusion can be achieved by DTLC of the ascending aorta. Normothermic circulatory arrest of up to 5 min can be tolerated [8], which should enable identifying the true lumen and placing the arterial cannula—usually, this part required < 2 min [4, 6]. Preliminary aortic arch inspection for further entries of the dis-section allows for precise definition of the consecutive surgical procedure with respect to temperature management and cere-bral protection regime. When the presumed diagnostic findings are restricted to the ascending aorta, the arterial cannula can be moved to the aortic arch. This cannulation site has been applied as a quick, safe and easy approach in patients with AADA [4, 6, 7]. We consider the Overholt clamp placement behind the dis-sected aorta as the riskiest part of DTLC. Most important is the careful dissection between the adventitial layer of the ascending aorta and the pulmonary artery: the adventitial layer of the aorta must remain intact when placing the tape. Even in patients whose aortic dissection displays a 360 -degree <b>circumferential</b> <b>separation</b> of the lumina [9], DTLC facilitates safe and fast cannulation. Accordingly, DTLC should not only be con-sidered as a ‘bail-out ’ strategy when peripheral cannulation fails. Its major advantage is the correct identification of the true lumen and thus an antegrade organ perfusion. SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL Supplementary material is available at ICVTS online...|$|E
