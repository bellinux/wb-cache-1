40|$|For {{aqueous wastes}} {{containing}} 1 to 20 wt% organics, supercritical water oxidation is less costly than <b>controlled</b> <b>incineration</b> or activated carbon treatment {{and far more}} efficient than wet oxidation. Above the critical temperature (374 C) and pressure (218 atm) of water, organic materials and gases are completely miscible with water. In supercritical water oxidation, organics, air and water are brought together in a mixture at 250 atm and temperatures above 400 C. Organic oxidation is initiated spontaneously at these conditions. The heat of combustion is released within the fluid and results in a rise in temperature 600 to 650 C. Under these conditions, organics are destroyed rapidly with efficiencies in excess of 99. 999 %. Heteroatoms are oxidized to acids, which can be precipitated out as salts by adding a base to the feed.

Municipal solid waste incinerators also normally include flue gas treatments to reduce pollutants further. This is needed because uncontrolled incineration of plastic produces polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, a carcinogen (cancer causing chemical). The problem occurs because the heat content of the waste stream varies. Open-air burning of plastic occurs at lower temperatures, and normally releases such toxic fumes.|$|R

40|$|The {{most common}} type of {{accident}} is a fuel spill on the ground, which, depending on the circumstances, can cause serious pollution of soil and groundwater. When fuel has seeped into the soil, there are not many effective response methods available for fire departments. The current practice mainly involves occasional pumping from ground pits, excavation and transportation of soil for treatment on landfills. Because fire departments are usually first to arrive at the scene of an accident, they could minimize the consequences of accidental fuel spills by implementing a first-responder system. A first-response remediation system should be not only effective but also relatively simple to implement and rapid. The general objective {{of this study was to}} develop a vacuum-extraction based response method and equipment for fire departments to use in treating fresh fuel spills. The procedure developed enables volatile fuels to be recovered in both liquid and vapor forms, liquids can be separated from vapors and vapors destroyed by <b>controlled</b> <b>incineration.</b> The development work comprised experiments at four different scales: 1.

40|$|Problems {{and options}} for those organisations contemplating {{changes in their}} refuse-disposal {{policies}} and processes are reviewed. <b>Controlled</b> <b>incineration</b> is potentially the safest method of destroying the more toxic industrial wastes such as PCBs, which are especially persistent. The use of the resulting hot gases to produce superheated steam to drive a turbine and thereby generate electricity can be a bonus. Factors influencing the incineration of either raw municipal waste or refuse-derived fuels are discussed and two quite different types of incinerator design are described and their characteristics compared. The first type, which employs a reciprocating grate, is simple, effective and capable of burning untreated refuse, albeit with rather low combustion efficiencies. The second type, which uses a fluidised-bed incinerator, is also thought capable of burning untreated refuse, although the pelletised combustible components would be preferred. In addition, the fluidised bed requires more complicated control of the combustion reactions, {{with the result that}} higher combustion temperatures and efficiencies can thus be achieved. In essence, effective incineration of refuse requires highly sophisticated machinery, expensive pollution-control equipment and high standards of management. The incomplete incineration of wastes at temperatures below 1100 Â°C can lead to the formation of dangerous end-products, for example, partially-burned PCBs can give rise to dioxins and di-benzofurans, which are also highly toxic substances. ...|$|E
40|$|High-temperature, <b>controlled</b> <b>incineration</b> {{and thermal}} {{treatment}} of contaminated soils, sediments, and wastes at Superfund sites are often preferred methods of {{remediation of contaminated sites}} under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 and related legislation. Although these methods may be executed safely, formation of toxic combustion or reaction by-products {{is still a}} cause of concern. Emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs), including polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans; and toxic metals (e. g., chromium VI) have historically been the focus of combustion and health effects research. However, fine particulate matter (PM) and ultrafine PM, which have been documented to be related to cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, and cancer, have more recently become the focus of research. Fine PM and ultrafine PM are effective delivery agents for PAHs, CHCs, and toxic metals. In addition, it has recently been realized that brominated hydrocarbons (including brominated/chlorinated dioxins), redox-active metals, and redox-active persistent free radicals are also associated with PM emissions from combustion and thermal processes. In this article, we discuss the origin of each of these classes of pollutants, the nature of their association with combustion-generated PM, and the mechanisms of their known and potential health impacts.

40|$|Preface. This {{report is}} a product of the Cornell “open burning group, ” which formed in Winter 2002 to assess the extent and {{environmental}} health significance of open burning of household wastes and agricultural plastics in New York State (NYS), and begin work towards reducing these practices in order to protect public health and the environment. The report focuses on disposal of agricultural plastics—rather than on the household waste stream—for reasons that include the importance of agriculture in NY and the role of Cornell’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences in working with NYS agriculture and the environment. Background and rationale. Plastics (LDPE, HDPE, polystyrene resins) have become ubiquitous in agriculture: In dairy farming they are used as silage bags, bunker silo covers, bale wraps and twines; in nurseries and ornamental horticulture they are used as hoophouse covers, trays and containers; in fruit and vegetable production, as row covers and mulch films. Plastic pesticide containers are used in all sectors of agriculture. Increasingly, plastics are substituted for the longer lasting materials previously used in agriculture (e. g., silage bags in place of concrete silos, plastic hoop houses in place of glass green houses) because of production efficiency and economics. More than half the plastics are disposed by burning onfarm, with most of the remainder buried or dumped on-farm. Due to inefficiencies of open combustion, emissions from open burning are much greater per mass of material burned than emissions from <b>controlled</b> <b>incineration</b> (e. g., 20 times as much dioxin, 40 times as much particulate matter). These emissions pose risks to human health...|$|E
40|$|Natural Aggregate (NA) is an {{essential}} ingredient for producing concrete. However, NA is a depleting resource and the quarrying and mining process are not environmentalfriendly. Thus, Recycled Aggregate @A) is introduced as an alternative material to replace NA Such an approach has been widely accepted in developed countries like United Kingdom, United States, Netherland, Denmark and Hong Kong. Nevertheless, concrete containing RA or known as Recycled Aggregate Concrete (RAC) has certain weakness in terms of permeability. This study is conducted in depth to explore ways to overcome these problems. Micronised Biomass Silica (MBS) has been recognised as a material with a good potential for such application. MBS is derived from <b>controlled</b> <b>incineration</b> of rice husk which is amorphous and with silicon dioxide (SiOz) content for about 87. 67 %. The reduction of MBS particle size to 25. 77 pin was by means of jar mill. The grade of 25 MPa concrete was produced with cement content 450 kg/m 3 and w/c 0. 5. MBS are used as cement replacement material for up to 12 % by weight and RA was used for up to 100 %. Comparative {{study was conducted with}} three different conditions namely; concrete with RA, concrete with MBS and MBS-RA concrete was carried out. It was found that the incorporation of 12 % MBS and 100 % RA has produced concrete with water permeability coefficient 7. 94 x 10 ' 12 d s and water penetration depth 64. 5 rnm for 28 days age of concrete and its compressive strength is 35. 40 MPa. Furthermore, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the microstructure of RAC and Natural Aggregate Concrete (NAC). It was observed that the quality of RAC significantly influences by ITZ. Regression analysis was also conducted to establish the relationship among different parameters (compressive strength, water permeability coefficient and water penetration) for RAC, NAC, MBS concrete and MBS-RA concrete. It was discovered that compressive strength has strong relationship with water permeability coefficient and water penetration. Two equations were proposed for predicting the compressive strength and water penetration for RAC and MBS-RA concrete. For proposing these equations, SPSS 14 was used. A nomograph chart as a guideline to designing RAC (with or without MBS) was also developed as the outcome of this study. This chart named as Nomograph Chart MBS-RA Concrete which comprises four axes represent cement content, compressive strength at 28 days or 365 days, percentage of RA and water penetration. Nomograph Chart MB S-RA Concrete is proposed to be used for designing MBS-RA concrete at 28 and up to 365 days...|$|E

25|$|Thermal {{oxidation}} (or incineration) {{can also}} be an effective remediation technology. This approach is somewhat controversial because of the risks of dioxins released in the atmosphere through the exhaust gases or effluent off-gas. <b>Controlled,</b> high temperature <b>incineration</b> with filtering of exhaust gases however should not pose any risks. Two different technologies can be employed to oxidize the contaminants of an extracted vapor stream. The selection of either thermal or catalytic depends on the type and concentration in parts per million by volume of constituent in the vapor stream. Thermal oxidation is more useful for higher concentration (~4,000 ppmV) influent vapor streams (which require less natural gas usage) than catalytic oxidation at ~2,000 ppmV.|$|R
40|$|After {{a general}} {{introduction}} of characteristics of possible critical reactor systems (CRS) and accelerator driven systems (ADS) it is proposed only to compare similar systems, {{based on the}} same design principles.

Although ADS may have important advantages, especially related to safety aspects, it is not yet clear that during accidents with heat decay removal failures, fuel melting and fuel slumping with the potential of recriticality configurations may be avoided. If such recriticality cannot be excluded, reconsideration of thermal ADS may be a suitable solution. ...|$|R
30|$|From 2006 to 2016, {{the amount}} of {{municipal}} solid waste (MSW) in China increases from 148 to 204 million tons (National Bureau of Statistics of China 2017). MSW disposal {{has become one of}} the most serious issues in China. Due to the advantages of volume reduction, energy recycling and hygienic <b>control,</b> MSW <b>incineration</b> has faster development than other disposal methods (Cheng and Hu 2010). However, the construction of MSW incineration power plant is facing great resistance because of its high investment cost and secondary pollutions, low efficiency and public protest. In comparison with establishing a new MSW incineration power station, co-combustion of MSW and coal gangue in existing power generation station has greater potential (Leckner 2007). Coal gangue is one of the largest industrial solid wastes and has low calorific value and volatile content (Liu and Liu 2010). Circulating fluidized bed (CFB) is generally used for its combustion and high-quality coal is also added to keep stable burning. MSW has high volatile content and low ignition temperature, so the co-combustion of coal gangue and MSW instead of coal can not only realize the efficient and clean disposal of MSW but also improve the combustion characteristics of coal gangue. More important, by the co-combustion of coal gangue and MSW, no new MSW incineration power station is needed which will dramatically reduce the capital investment and public resistance.|$|R

40|$|A {{central issue}} for the {{protection}} of {{human health and the environment}} will also be the reduction in future of the new inputs of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans, generally designated dioxins, into the environment. Effective measures have already been taken in Germany in recent years to fulfill this matter of concern. One example of this is the 17 th Ordinance for the implementation of the Federal Imission <b>Control</b> Act (Waste <b>Incineration</b> Installations Ordinance). This ordinance applies to all installations in which certain waste materials in solid or in liquid form, or similar substances are incinerated. As well as strict requirements for an extensive range of airpolluting materials, it also lowers the emission-limit values for dioxins to 0. 1 ng TE/m" 3 in waste gases. Against this background and commissioned by the Conference of the Ministers for the Environment and by the State Commission for Immission Control, it shall be investigated whether the limit values 0. 1 ng TE/m" 3 for emissions can also be applied to other emitting groups. In order to respond to this question, a working group has been set up under the direction of the Federal Ministry for the Environment. The information available on emissions of dioxins from installations which do not fall under the Ordinance for Installations for Waste Material Incineration, has been compiled. Emphasis of the investigation was placed on large stationary industrial sources (installations subject to licensing in accordance with the Federal Imission Control Act); furthermore, the available information on domestic firing installations, dry cleaning processes and traffic was also compiled.
