40|$|Intentional cranial {{deformations}} (ICD) {{have been}} observed worldwide but are especially prevalent in preColombian cultures. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the consequences of ICD on three <b>cranial</b> <b>cavities</b> (intracranial cavity, orbits, and maxillary sinuses) and on cranial vault thickness, in order to screen for morphological changes due to the external constraints exerted by the deformation device. We acquired CT-scans for 39 deformed and 19 control skulls. We studied the thickness of the skull vault using qualitative and quantitative methods. We computed the volumes of the orbits, of the maxillary sinuses, and of the intracranial cavity using haptic-aided semi-automatic segmentation. We finally defined 3 D distances and angles within orbits and maxillary sinuses based on 27 anatomical landmarks and measured these features on the 58 skulls. Our results show specific bone thickness patterns in some types of ICD, with localized thinning in regions subjected to increased pressure and thickening in other regions. Our findings confirm that volumes of the <b>cranial</b> <b>cavities</b> are not affected by ICDs but that the shapes of the orbits and of the maxillary sinuses are modified in circumferential deformations. We conclude that ICDs can modify the shape of the <b>cranial</b> <b>cavities</b> and the thickness of their walls but conserve their volumes. These results provide new insights into the morphological effects associated with ICDs and call for similar investigations in subjects with deformational plagiocephalies and craniosynostoses.

500|$|The koala {{has one of}} the {{smallest}} brains in proportion to body weight of any mammal, being 60% smaller than that of a typical diprotodont, weighing only [...] The brain's surface is fairly smooth, typical for a [...] "primitive" [...] animal. It occupies only 61% of the <b>cranial</b> <b>cavity</b> and is pressed against the inside surface by cerebrospinal fluid. The function of this relatively large amount of fluid is not known, although one possibility is that it acts as a shock absorber, cushioning the brain if the animal falls from a tree. The koala's small brain size may be an adaptation to the energy restrictions imposed by its diet, which is insufficient to sustain a larger brain. Because of its small brain, the koala has a limited ability to perform complex, unfamiliar behaviours. For example, when presented with plucked leaves on a flat surface, the animal cannot adapt to the change in its normal feeding routine and will not eat the leaves. The koala's olfactory senses are normal, and it is known to sniff the oils of individual branchlets to assess their edibility. Its nose is fairly large and covered in leathery skin. Its round ears provide it with good hearing, and it has a well-developed middle ear. A koala's vision is not well developed, and its relatively small eyes are unusual among marsupials in that the pupils have vertical slits. Koalas make use of a novel vocal organ to produce low-pitched sounds (see social spacing, below). Unlike typical mammalian vocal cords, which are folds in the larynx, these organs are placed in the velum (soft palate) and are called velar vocal cords.|$|E

From December 2009 to March 2010, a total of 87 samples were obtained by necropsy for skull inspection. The larvae were collected, and microscopically identified. The prevalence in the sampled sheep was 60. 9 %. From those that were infected, 85. 7 % (18 / 21) of sheep were 1 to 3 years old, constituting the stratum with the highest prevalence. The difference of infection in females and males was not significant. The high risk of infection seems to be dependent upon the environmental conditions of this southern region, especially during summer when the first larval stage (L 1) could be found as the evidence. Therefore, the disease should be considered as a significant problem for this kind of livestock production...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To analyze bone {{repair process}} in Wistar rats' calvaria, {{with the use}} of two {{different}} biomaterials. METHODS: Forty two male Wistar rats were used, and four bicortical <b>cranial</b> <b>cavities</b> were created in each animal. The cavities were filled with: bioactive glass (BG); calcium sulfate barrier (CSB); bioactive glass covered with calcium sulfate barrier (BG/CSB); and autogenous blood clot (control). The animals were euthanized 7, 14, 21, 30, 60, 90, e 120 days after surgery. The scalps were removed and submitted to a routine process for histological preparation: staining with Haematoxylin and Eosin (HE). RESULTS: The BG was not completely resorbed; however, after 60 days, a decrease in size as well as a change in the morphological granule were observed. CSB was not observed in the last group (after 120 days). CONCLUSIONS: In Wistar rat calvaria bioactive glass, in an isolated form, negatively interfered in the bone repair process; the calcium sulfate barrier, in an isolated form, presented the capacity to maintain space, allowing the flow of osteogenic cells; the bioactive glass covered with calcium sulfate barrier association presented a better osteoconductive capacity when compared to isolated materials; calcium sulfate barrier was completely resorbed after 90 days; control cavities did not completely heal until 120 days after surgery...|$|R
2500|$|Another key {{function}} of the glymphatic system was documented [...] by Thrane et al., who in 2013 demonstrated that the brain's system of paravascular pathways {{plays an important role}} in transporting small lipophilic molecules. [...] Led by M.

[...] Although further experiments are needed to parse out the physiological significance of the connection between the glymphatic circulation, calcium signalling and paravascular lipid transport in the brain, the findings point to the adoption of a function in the CNS similar to the capacity of the intestinal lymph vessels (lacteals) to carry lipids to the liver.|$|E

In the Howler Monkey or 'Mycetes' (see Fig. 16), the line passes obliquely upwards and backwards, and the cerebral overlap is almost nil; while in the Lemurs, as in the lower mammals, the line is much more inclined in the same direction, and the cerebellar chamber projects considerably beyond the cerebral.|$|E

Other recent evolutionary analysis emphasizes methodological innovations in cladistic analysis, with major revisions of mammalian phylogeny (McKenna & Bell, 1997; cf. Simpson, 1945).

40|$|Including {{at least}} 15 extant species, the beaked whale genus Mesoplodon (Cetacea, Odontoceti, Ziphiidae) {{is by far}} the most species-rich {{cetacean}} genus. Such a high diversity reflects one or several pulses of radiation, most likely involving a sexual selection mechanism affecting shape, size, and position of mandibular tusks. However, the tempo of this diversification is currently poorly constrained due to the scarce fossil record. Based on the reassessment of five partial skulls discovered in Antwerp (north of Belgium), a new fossil species of the genus Mesoplodon, M. posti, sp. nov., is described. Only the second fossil species of the genus currently recognized, it is characterized (among other features) by: transverse sections of the rostrum higher than wide (a feature proposed to correspond to the presence of lower tusks more posterior than the apex of the mandibles); the presence of a basirostral groove at the rostrum base; pentagonal joined nasals; the posterior projection of the premaxilla in the vertex shorter than the nasal backward; and a strong transverse compression of the frontals behind the nasals. Our phylogenetic analysis results in M. posti being nested among extant species of Mesoplodon.
