40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 28 - 31, 1985 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaSpace-Ground-Link-System (SGLS) is a {{specific}} capability of an earth terminal which, {{in conjunction with a}} space vehicle (SV) transponder, provides Tracking, Telemetry and Commanding (TT&C) services for space vehicles. This paper describes a multi-purpose, single <b>chassis</b> <b>earth</b> terminal receiver/ processor (R/P) which provides and supports those services. The R/P utilizes digital design techniques and microprocessor executed algorithims that provides a design that is physically small (12 inch high chassis), reliable (MTBF > 4000 hours) and parameters/performance that exceed most present and future TT&C requirements...|$|E

A current loop {{can also be}} used to control a valve positioner or other output actuator. Since input terminals of instruments may have one side of the current loop input tied to the <b>chassis</b> ground (<b>earth),</b> analog isolators may be required when connecting several instruments in series.|$|R
