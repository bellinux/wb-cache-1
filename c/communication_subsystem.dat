40|$|Emerging {{applications}} mostly require both, {{high performance}} {{as well as}} support {{of a wide variety}} of communication services. For example, audio, video, and data transmission may require highly different services, e. g., guaranteed delay, jitter, or bandwidth. An additional challenge arises by the growing demand for multipoint communication services. ATM networks are capable of satisfying the basic application requirements by providing multipoint bearer services with data rates exceeding a gigabit per second. However, current <b>communication</b> <b>subsystems</b> (including higher layer protocols) that provide reliable services are not able to deliver the available network performance to the applications. In order to provide the required high performance services to the applications, new protocols as well as high-performance implementation architectures for the <b>communication</b> <b>subsystems</b> need to be designed. Dedicated VLSI components should be used in flexible implementation platforms used for time-critical processing tasks in order to provide high performance.

40|$|Forthcoming applications, {{especially}} distributed multimedia {{and interactive}} applications, have stringent requirements {{on the quality}} of the communication service. Therefore, an integrated Quality-ofService (QoS) management is needed including all involved components to guarantee a communication service from application to application. One promising approach to guarantee a certain level of service uses the reservation of communication resources and the assignment of these resources to individual data streams based on the requested service. However, often it is not sufficient to reserve resources only. Additionally, monitoring of QoS parameters must be applied to ensure that the negotiated QoS is achieved. Within this paper, the design and implementation of a QoS monitor for <b>communication</b> <b>subsystems</b> is presented. 1.

40|$|Sustainability {{issues are}} {{typically}} characterized by high complexity and uncertainty. In light of this, communication plays {{a crucial role}} in coping with these challenges. The previous debate on sustainability communication has largely focused on how to communicate sustainability issues to others. Sustainability communication, however, involves more than sender oriented communication to persuade others (“communication of sustainability”); it also embraces processes of dialogue and discourse (“communication about sustainability”). Based on this distinction, we develop a typology of communication modes, including communication for sustainability. Inspired by the notion of functional communication systems, we explore sustainability communication in six societal subsystems, applying the typology of communication modes. Drawing mostly on examples from Germany, we find a shift from “communication of” towards “communication about” sustainability in most <b>subsystems.</b> While <b>communication</b> <b>subsystems</b> have a tendency towards operational closure, a variety of interlinkages exist. We discuss three key areas of “opening up” <b>communication</b> <b>subsystems,</b> leading to transdisciplinarity, societal deliberation and governance, each meeting one of sustainability’s core challenges...|$|R
