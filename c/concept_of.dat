40|$|There are two <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> {{consciousness}} {{that are easy}} to confuse with one another, access-consciousness and phenomenal consciousness.

The focus of this paper is on the problems that arise when these two <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> consciousness are conflated. I will argue that John Searles reasoning about the function of consciousness goes wrong because he conflates the two senses. And Francis Crick and Christof Koch fall afoul of the ambiguity in arguing that visual area V 1 {{is not part of the}} neural correlate of consciousness.
