The contours are characterized by their topologically ordered 1 D structures, against otherwise chaotic 2 D image clutter. Used as integral shape matching units, they are powerful for preventing accidental alignment to isolated edges, dramatically reducing false shape detections in clutter. ^ We then propose a set-to-set shape matching paradigm that measures and compares holistic shape configurations.

The holistic configuration is captured by shape features with a large spatial extent, and the long-range contextual relationships among contours. The unique feature of this approach is the ability to overcome unpredictable contour fragmentations. Computationally, set-to-set-matching is a hard combinatorial problem. We propose a linear programming (LP) formulation for efficiently searching over exponentially many contour configurations. We also develop a primal-dual packing algorithm to quickly bound and prune solutions without actually running the LPs. ^ Finally, we generalize set-to-set shape matching on more sophisticated structures arising from both the model and the image. On the model side, we enrich the representation by compactly encoding part configuration selection in a tree, making holistic matching applicable to articulated objects. On the image side, we extend <b>contour</b> <b>packing</b> to regions, which has a fundamentally different topology. Bipartite graph packing is designed to cope with this change. A formulation by semidefinite programming (SDP) provides an efficient computational solution to this NP-hard problem, and the flexibility of expressing various bottom-up grouping cues. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{diffusive}} {{effect on}} barotropic models of mesoscale eddies is addressed, using the Melnikov method from dynamical systems. Simple geometric criteria are obtained, which identify whether a given eddy grows or drains out, under a diffusive (and forcing) perturbation on a potential vorticity conserving flow. Qualitatively, {{the following are}} shown to be features conducive to eddy growth (and, thereby, stability in a specific sense) : (i) large radius of curvature of the eddy boundary, (ii) potential vorticity <b>contours</b> more tightly <b>packed</b> within the eddy than outside, (iii) acute eddy pinchangle, (iv) small potential vorticity gradient across the eddy boundary, and (v) meridional wind forcing, which increases in the northward direction. The Melnikov approach also suggests how tendrils (filaments) could be formed through {{the breaking of the}} eddy boundary, as a diffusion-driven advective process. 1 Eddies and their stability Rings (or eddies) are significant oceanographic features which contribute considerably to fluid transport in the ocean. In particular, mesoscale (of the order of 100 km) rings formed near the Gulf Stream sometimes survive as coherent structures for periods of up to one year (Richardson, 1983). Submesoscale (of the order of 10 km) eddies may also be long-lived, and we address both mesoscale and submesoscale eddies in the present work. The observational persistence of such eddies has led to theoretical (Flierl, 1988...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{is the study of}} decolmatation rate of {{granular}} layer of gravel pack of well during creating inside of it flushing of reagent with given hydrodynamic parameters and determination the duration of treatment. This article deals with radical movement of chemical solutions by injection of it outside of gravel pack of filter when the flow directs to borehole axis under conditions of quasi-steady-state mode of filtration for equal yield of input and output reagent from borehole. Colmataged layer of gravel pack is schematized in the form of porous ring cylinder with outside radius which is equal to radius of line of gravel pack and the height which is equal to the length of filter made in formation drilling and inside radius which is equal to radius of filter. Initial saturation of subsoil with colmatant is given. It was accepted that reagent with given rate flows through outside surface of ring cylinder equal along all height. Near-filtering zone is given uniform and movement is quasi-steady-state. Equations’ system is composed including: joint equation of movement and mass conservation and generalized equation of kinetics, which describes kinetics of colmatant dissolution in the regime of out-pipe watering of ring gravel pack of well taking into account the change of structure of porous medium. The analytic solution of equations’ system was obtained, which allow to calculate salt content in reagent during the leaching process and to determine the specific volume of deposits in the point of gravel pack at any moment of time in the process of regent injection. The analytic dependence was obtained for calculation of duration of complete regeneration of soil grains’ layer of outer <b>contour</b> of gravel <b>packing.</b> For calculation of duration of full regeneration of the whole thickness of packing it is suggested to divide the regeneration period into a series of stages of salt transferring from subsoil. Duration of one stage is equal to time which is necessary for reagent to pass ring part. Each phase is calculated  separately, as the initial specific volume of deposits in inflow section is changing after each previous phase, and this demands the correction of border conditions. Methods of stage calculation of regeneration duration for achievement of required level of decolmatation is realized on compute...|$|R
40|$| 2) A pure {{sample of}} 7 {{crystallized}} along pathway 1 in two enantiotropic modifications, one obtained {{at room temperature}} (form) and the other at 20 C 0 (form) [Figure 2]. Behaving much like a temperature guided molecular switch, the tetraacetate 7 could be shifted reversibly between the forms response {{to changes in the}} ambient temperature. Thus, the form converted at - 4 OC to the denser form, which displayed an unusual kinetic stability till 67 OC and transformed back to the form beyond this temperature. Subsequently, the close similarity between the self-assemble of the two dimonrphs of 7 and the diastereomer 11 was exploited in order to stimulated 7 to fallow the pathway 2 through preferential inhibition of pathway 1 [Figure 3]. Interstingly, the nucleation inhibition 11 was obtained serendipitously a route 7 via an apparent breakdownof furst-platter rule. Unlike the tetraceatate 7, crystal packing in the tetrabenzoate 8 preferred to fallow exclusively pathway 2. The individualistic nature of the self-assemblies of 7 and 8 found to be in contrast commonalities noted in the mode of molecular assembly in 9 and 10 both of which conformed to a combination of pathway 1 and 2. A rationale for the preferred crystallization pathway of the four estes 7 - 10 as well as probable mechanism for the observed reversible transformation between the forms the tetracetate 7 will be put forth in this chapter.

In light of the wide ranging application of organofluorine compounds and the ambiguity that resides over the disposition of fluorine as a H-bond accepter, the third chapter utilizes three specially designed fluorinated polycyclitols 12 - 14 investigate the role of covalently bonded flurine in crystal structures of lesser studied aliphatic fluorous substracts and probe its capacity to engage itself in C(sp 3) -F…H-X(sp 3) (X=O and/or C) H-bounding, in presence of its isostere, the hydrozyl group. Conformatonality locked with well defined spatial disposition of functional groups, all the fluorinated polycyclitols 12 - 14 bear a fluorohydrin moiety, embedded in a rigid trans-decalin framework. In 12 and 14, it was conceived that the presence of a hydroxyl donor in a favorable 1, 3 -syndiaxial relationship to a fluoro group {{on one side and a}} hydroxyl group on the other would allow an unambiguous comparison between the two isoteric functionalities (C-OH and C-F) to serve as acceptors for intramolecular hydrogen bonds (O-H…O and purported O-H…F respectively) The difluorodiol 13 was sought to serve as a control to assess the change in the C-F…H-X interactions (if any) which might be observed upon incorporating the peripheral secondary hydroxyl groups in 14. The result presented in this chapter will revel, in particular, that C(sp 3) –F…H-C(sp 3) hydrogen bonds, though weak and lesser investigated, can indeed be observed and supramolecular recognition motifs, involving such interactions, can be conserved even in crystal structures laden with stronger O-H…O hydrogen bonds [Figure 4 }. Figure 4. (Left) Molecular packing in the difluorodiol 13, showing how four intermolecular C-H…F hydrogen bonds forms a part of a R 22 H-bonding motif (encircled). This centrosymmentic supramolecular recognition unit is observed even in the molecular packing in the difluorohexol 14 (right). Non-interacting H atoms have been omitted in both diagrams for the sake of clarity. The forth chapter details an in-depth study carried out on the self-assembly of a conformationally locked aminoalchohol 15, in which the amino protons serve as mere spectators, the molecular packing in the crystal being realized through the co-operativity between O-H…N H-bonds and weak π-π stacking interaction (Figure 5 b). The crystal structure of 15 was quite intriguing on three sailent grounds (a) previous studies on the supramolecular assemblies in the aminols have shown that both amino and hydroxyl protons participate in H-bonding in the crystal structures of such compounds; (b) the fact that the hydrogen atoms of the NH 2 group Figure 5.

Charge destiny analysis was carried out on the aminoalcoholf 15 not only to catheterize the non-covalent interactions existing in the supramolecular assembly in terms of topological features of electrol destiny at their bond critical points, but also to confirm the non-involvement of the amino H-atoms in any form of either intra- or intermoalecular hydrogen bonds beyond the criteria of mere geometry (Figure a,c,d). The maverick nature of the self-assembly of 15 was elucidated as resulting from the preference of the molecules to assemble with O-H…N H-bonds. This automatically relegated the hydrogen atoms of the tertiary amine to the interior of the conformationally locked cabocycclic scaffold, thereby making them far less accessible than the peripheral C=C bonds...|$|R
