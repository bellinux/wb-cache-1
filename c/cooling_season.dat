50|$|Free cooling {{systems can}} have very high efficiencies, and are {{sometimes}} combined with seasonal {{thermal energy storage}} so the cold of winter {{can be used for}} summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the <b>cooling</b> <b>season,</b> and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the <b>cooling</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E

40|$|While {{the spring}} and summer months are {{typically}} the severe weather climatological peak for the East-Central United States, severe thunderstorms and deadly regional tornado outbreaks can occur during the <b>cool</b> <b>season</b> months (e. g., October-March). In an effort to better document and improve operational forecasting of these events, this study focuses on <b>cool</b> <b>season</b> severe thunderstorms in the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys during the 1995 - 2002 <b>cool</b> <b>seasons.</b> Most severe thunderstorm and tornado events in the East-Central United States during the <b>cool</b> <b>season</b> are characterized by a high frequency of wind reports compared to hail and tornado reports. All severe report classes (i. e. tornadoes, hail, and wind) displayed a frequency tendency to remain high in the late evening and overnight hours. Additionally, it was found that tornado occurrence typically {{came in the form of}} a tornado outbreak. Additionally, when tornadoes did occur, they were found to be statistically more intense than tornadoes outside of the EC region during the same period. It is also concluded tornadoes favor the southern half of the region, whereas hail and wind reports tend to favor the southern two thirds of the region. In examination of <b>cool</b> <b>season</b> supercell characteristics, supercells favors a west-southwest to east-northeast mean motion around 45 mph. The relationship of only 11 percent between the distances of supercell tornado paths to tornadic supercell paths is an operationally important discovery.

50|$|Since {{buildings}} are not totally sealed (at the very minimum, {{there is always}} a ground level entrance), the stack effect will cause air infiltration. During the heating season, the warmer indoor air rises up through the building and escapes at the top either through open windows, ventilation openings, or unintentional holes in ceilings, like ceiling fans and recessed lights. The rising warm air reduces the pressure in the base of the building, drawing cold air in through either open doors, windows, or other openings and leakage. During the <b>cooling</b> <b>season,</b> the stack effect is reversed, but is typically weaker due to lower temperature differences.|$|E
5000|$|The Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) is {{also the}} COP(or EER) {{expressed}} in BTU/W·hr, but instead of being evaluated at a single operating condition, it represents the expected overall performance for a typical year's weather in a given location. The SEER is thus calculated with the same indoor temperature, but over a range of outside temperatures from [...] to , with a certain specified percentage of time in each of 8 bins spanning 5 °F (2.8 °C).

5000|$|The {{performance}} of vapor compression refrigeration cycles {{is limited by}} thermodynamics.

Instead, the Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) has traditionally been used to characterize the performance of many HVAC systems. EER is the Energy Efficiency Ratio based on a 35 C outdoor temperature. To more accurately describe the performance of air conditioning equipment over a typical <b>cooling</b> <b>season</b> {{a modified version of}} the EER, the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER), or in Europe the ESEER, is used.

5000|$|Throughout the <b>cooling</b> <b>season,</b> {{the system}} works to cool and {{dehumidify}} the incoming, outside air. This is accomplished by the system taking the rejected heat and sending it into the exhaust airstream. Subsequently, this air cools the condenser coil at a lower temperature than if the rejected heat had not entered the exhaust airstream. During the heating seasons, {{the system works}} in reverse. Instead of discharging the heat into the exhaust airstream, the system draws heat from the exhaust airstream in order to pre-heat the incoming air. At this stage, the air passes through a primary unit and then into a space. With this type of system, it is normal, during the cooling seasons, for the exhaust air to be cooler than the ventilation air and, during the heating seasons, warmer than the ventilation air. It {{is for this reason}} the system works very efficiently and effectively. The [...] Coefficient of Performance (COP) will increase as the conditions become more extreme (i.e., more hot and humid for cooling and colder for heating).|$|E
50|$|A {{vertical}} {{closed loop}} field {{is composed of}} pipes that run vertically in the ground. A hole is bored in the ground, typically 50 to- 400 ft deep. Pipe pairs in the hole are joined with a U-shaped cross connector {{at the bottom of}} the hole. The borehole is commonly filled with a bentonite grout surrounding the pipe to provide a thermal connection to the surrounding soil or rock to improve the heat transfer. Thermally enhanced grouts are available to improve this heat transfer. Grout also protects the ground water from contamination, and prevents artesian wells from flooding the property. Vertical loop fields are typically used when there is a limited area of land available. Bore holes are spaced at least 5-6 m apart and the depth depends on ground and building characteristics. For illustration, a detached house needing 10 kW (3 ton) of heating capacity might need three boreholes 80 to 110 m deep. (A ton of heat is 12,000 British thermal units per hour (BTU/h) or 3.5 kilowatts.) During the <b>cooling</b> <b>season,</b> the local temperature rise in the bore field is influenced most by the moisture travel in the soil. Reliable heat transfer models have been developed through sample bore holes as well as other tests.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study investigating the energy performance of electrochromic windows in heating-dominated geographic locations under a variety of state-switching control strategies. The authors used the DOE- 2. 1 E energy simulation program to analyze the annual heating, cooling and lighting energy use and performance as a function of glazing type, size, and electrochromic control strategy. They simulated a prototypical commercial office building module located in Madison, Wisconsin. Control strategies analyzed were based on daylight illuminance, incident total solar radiation, and space cooling load. The results show that overall energy performance is best if the electrochromic is left in its clear or bleached state during the heating season, but controlled during the <b>cooling</b> <b>season</b> using daylight illuminance as a control strategy. Even in such heating dominated locations as madison, there is still a well-defined <b>cooling</b> <b>season</b> when electrochromic switching will be beneficial.

40|$|Forage {{production}} in silvopastoral {{systems of the}} Flooding Pampa is based on <b>cool</b> <b>season</b> grasses with a relatively asynchronous phenology regarding their accompanying deciduous trees.
