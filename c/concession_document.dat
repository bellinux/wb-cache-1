If Lobengula agreed, Rudd's backers would furnish the king with 1,000 Martini–Henry breech-loading rifles, 100,000 rounds of matching ammunition, a steamboat on the Zambezi (or, if Lobengula preferred, a lump sum of £500), and £100 a month in perpetuity. More impressive to the king than the financial aspects of this offer were the weapons: he {{had at the time}} between 600 and 800 rifles and carbines, but almost no ammunition for them. The proposed arrangement would lavishly stock his arsenal with both firearms and bullets, which might prove decisive in the event of conflict with the South African Republic. The weapons might also help him keep control of the more rambunctious factions amid his own impis. Lobengula had Helm go over the document with him several times, in great detail, to ensure that he properly understood what was written. None of Rudd's alleged oral conditions were in the <b>concession</b> <b>document,</b> making them legally unenforceable (presuming they indeed existed), but the king apparently regarded them as part of the proposed agreement nonetheless.|$|E

The name that has an Abenaki origin, would mean [...] "a lot of waterfowl" [...] but other senses are also advanced. It appears officially {{in the eighteenth century}} in the <b>concession</b> <b>document</b> made on April 6, 1733 to Paul-Louis de Lusignan Dazemard as the [...] "Missiskouy Bay". The graph will change several times. In 1855, when changes to electoral counties of Lower Canada into electoral districts, the Legislature finally adopts the form Missisquoi to designate the county and the region.|$|E
50|$|After the Palatinate’s first railway line, between Ludwigshafen and Bexbach, {{came into}} service in 1849, Dürkheim, Deidesheim {{and the other}} {{municipalities}} in the Middle Haardt, too, strove for a rail link. A local committee put forth a suggestion in 1860 to build a railway line from Neustadt to Dürkheim in Frankenthal, a request that was granted on 3 February 1862 by {{the administration of the}} Pfälzische Ludwigsbahn. One of the eight signers from the local committee was the Deidesheim landowner Ludwig Andreas Jordan. The Bavarian King Maximilian II eventually awarded the committee, represented by the eight signatories thereto, the “Supreme <b>Concession</b> <b>Document</b> for Forming a Corporation to Build and Run a Railway from Neustadt a. H. to Dürkheim”. To carry out this project, a company was formed, the Neustadt-Dürkheimer Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, which was later absorbed by the Gesellschaft der Pfälzischen Nordbahnen.|$|E

50|$|In 1920, Holmes {{helped set}} up the Eastern and General Syndicate Ltd in London to develop, among other things, oil ventures in the Middle East. In 1922 he {{travelled}} to Arabia to discuss {{the possibility of an}} oil concession with Emir Ibn Saud, who ruled parts of the eastern peninsula. With Ibn Saud’s permission, he carried out a survey over four weeks in the desert and returned to Hofuf with earth samples which he claimed bore traces of oil. In order to allay the suspicions of British officials, Holmes claimed that {{he was looking for a}} rare butterfly, the Black Admiral of Qatif, although this deception appears not to have been effective. At the Uqair conference later in the year, Holmes approached Ibn Saud with a view to finalising a <b>concession</b> <b>document</b> but the British High Commissioner, Sir Percy Cox, persuaded Ibn Saud not to sign. It was only when the British government ended Ibn Saud’s annual stipend in 1923 that Ibn Saud considered himself free of British control and awarded a concession to Holmes for the region of al-Hasa. But when a subsequent survey was unfavourable, and a financially challenged Eastern and General Syndicate failed to find a bidder, the concession for al-Hasa was allowed to lapse. Holmes, nevertheless, still entertained hopes of finding oil on Bahrain and concentrated his efforts there.|$|E

5000|$|These {{concessions}} did {{not bring}} the expected peace but were received with violent reactionary opposition everywhere. Europe had come to expect {{an end to the}} Investiture controversy, and was not willing to return to the old days when the Holy Roman Emperor named the pope. [...] The greatest resistance was seen in France and was led by Guido, who still held the office of the papal legate. [...] He had been present in the Lateran Synod of 1112 which had proclaimed the Privilegium of 1111. On his return to France, Guido convoked an assembly of the French and Burgundian bishops at Vienne (1112). There the lay investiture of the clergy (the practice of the king, especially the Holy Roman Emperor naming bishops and the pope) was denounced as heretical. [...] A sentence of excommunication was pronounced against Henry V, who had extorted through violence from the pope the <b>concessions</b> <b>documented</b> in the Privilegium. The agreement was deemed to be opposed to the interests of the Church. [...] The decrees from the assembly of Vienne which denounced the Privilegium were sent to Paschal II with a request for confirmation. Pope Paschal II confirmed these which were received in general terms, on October 20, 1112.|$|R
50|$|Schedules of <b>concessions</b> are <b>documents</b> {{in which}} the {{specific}} commitments are listed. World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations produce general rules that apply to all members, and specific commitments made by individual member governments. For trade in goods in general, these consist of maximum tariff levels. For agriculture they also include tariff quotas, limits on export subsidies, and some kinds of domestic support. The goods schedules are annexed to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and are “bound” (GATT Article II). The schedule is normally divided into three column; 1. product classification, 2.description and 3. bound tariff.bound tariff is the maximum tariff that a country can impose however it is not normally the applied tariff mostly for the developing countries which uses a lower tariff known as the effective tariff.|$|R
40|$|A content {{analysis}} system for measuring positive concessions (offering concessions) and negative concessions (rejecting offered concessions) was introduced and validated through an archival study of government-to-government documents from 4 crises, 2 of which escalated {{to war and}} 2 of which were peacefully resolved. In the archival <b>documents,</b> <b>concession</b> making was positively associated with affiliation motivation and negatively associated with power motivation. A 2 nd, laboratory experimental study confirmed these relationships and demonstrated priming effects of motive imagery and concession making, in a received diplomatic letter, on participants 2 ̆ 7 responses. Finally, the motive imagery and concessions scores in participants 2 ̆ 7 responses were related in predicted ways to their policy choices...|$|R
500|$|But {{the king}} was already {{beginning}} to receive reports telling {{him that he had}} been hoodwinked into [...] "selling his country". Word abounded in Bulawayo that with the Rudd <b>Concession</b> (as the <b>document</b> became called), Lobengula had signed away far more impressive rights than he had thought. Some of the Matabele began to question the king's judgement. While the izinDuna looked on anxiously, Moffat questioned whether Lobengula would be able to keep control. Thompson was summoned by the izinDuna and interrogated for over 10 hours before being released; according to Thompson, they were [...] "prepared to suspect even the king himself". Rumours spread among the kraal's white residents of a freebooter force in the South African Republic that allegedly intended to invade and support Gambo, a prominent inDuna, in overthrowing and killing Lobengula. Horrified by these developments, Lobengula attempted to secure his position by deflecting blame. InDuna Lotshe, who had supported granting the concession, was condemned for having misled his king and executed, along with his extended family and followers—over 300 men, women and children in all. Meanwhile, Rhodes and Rudd returned to Kimberley, and Robinson wrote to the Colonial Office at Whitehall on 5 December 1888 to inform them of Rudd's concession.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} legal history has {{attracted}} scholars who have surveyed legal writings and their development {{over time as}} a body of literature. Others have taken this further by analyzing how the principles contained in these legal writings have been applied, by attempting to analyze cases with similar issues, usually in regards to a specific region or jurisdiction. This study combines both approaches by analyzing how Castilian law formed in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries and was applied first through the royal court and then through the Audiencia Real Castellana (high tribunal). While there have been studies that analyze Castilian institutions, such as the curia regis (royal assembly), the cortes, and the Audiencia, these focus primarily {{on the development of}} the respective institutions with the analysis of legal elements where they contribute to the institution’s history. Royal concessions, legislation, and cases have also been studied, but primarily to support the analysis of the reign of a particular monarch or the history of a specific region or kingdom. This study analyzes how the Castilian royal court and Audiencia Real Castellana applied law primarlily in deciding land disputes. It draws mainly from unpublished documents in the Archivo de la Real Audiencia y Chancillería in Valladolid, Spain. Other archival sources published and unpublished and secondary sources are analyzed as well. This research also incorporates formal legal analysis of royal concessions, lawsuits, and legislation, and it considers the impact of this legal tradition on the overseas possessions of the Castilian Crown, particularly in New Spain and New Mexico. The investigation focuses on land law, as land tenure on a practical level allowed the sovereigns of Castile to establish jurisdiction in other matters. It also held a central place in a royal policy that enabled the incorporation of enormous amounts of land in the Iberian Peninsula and the Americas by giving generous land grants to subjects of the crown. Territorial jurisdiction had to be established before a criminal case could be heard. Fernando III, Alfonso X, and Alfonso XI played significant roles in the formation of Castilian law and its dissemination in Castilian Spanish. Alfonso XI’s ordering of Castilian law through legislation promulgated at the cortes of Alcalá de Henares in 1348 enabled Enrique II to formally establish the Royal Audiencia in the cortes of Toro of 1371. Land disputes represented a significant number of cases that the court decided. They were critical to the crown’s claims of jurisdiction, upon which all other types of cases would then rely. Cases involving title, possession of land, usage rights, frequently adjudicated by the royal court, were now routinely adjudicated by the Audiencia. Title to communal lands, such as ejidos, pastos, and montes, were also disputed by villages, towns, and cities. The Audiencia consistently applied principles found in fueros (charters enumerating specific rights), royal concessions, and bodies of law such as the Fuero Juzgo, Espéculo de las Leyes, and the Siete Partidas. These principles were transmitted to the New World in concessions and written law through the authority of the Crown of Castile, which, through the Treaty of Tordesillas, claimed exclusive jurisdiction in the lands it claimed in the Americas. The crown established audiencias throughout the Americas. Viceroys and governors executed royal concessions to Natives and European settlers in what today is Latin America and also numerous states in the southwestern region of the United States. The final section of this study examines the province of New Mexico after the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. As all of the records from the Spanish Archives prior to the revolt have been lost or destroyed, an analysis of the documents in the archive after this event will show what legal system, particularly concerning land, Spaniards established. After analysis of documents from the Spanish Archives of New Mexico, Archivo General de la Nación of México, I make comparisons to Castilian land law prior to 1492. These comparisons show similarities in the royal <b>concessions,</b> accompanying <b>documents,</b> adjudications, and terminology that indicate that officials and inhabitants—Native, European, Mixed-Race (castas) —followed to a large degree legal precepts established in the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries. They reflect one legal tradition that followed long established royal policy, one that spans conventional historical periodizations. To understand the controversial adjudications by the United States of Spanish land grants, one must take into account the legal tradition and royal policies of the Crown of Castile before as well as after 1492. This also allows us to better understand the rich history of this lengthy era. HistoryDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico. Dept. of HistoryGraham, Timothy C. Ryan, Michael A.
