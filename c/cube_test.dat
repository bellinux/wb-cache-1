Methods: A total of 147 MCI patients were followed for 4 - 6 years and the incidence of AD was 11. 6 %/year. At baseline, the <b>cube</b> copying <b>test,</b> clock drawing test, MMSE and measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta-amyloid(1 - 42) (Abeta(42)) were performed. Results: The <b>cube</b> copying <b>test,</b> but not the clock drawing test, could predict AD among MCI patients with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0. 64 (p < 0. 01). The relative risk for future AD was increased in MCI subjects with impaired <b>cube</b> copying <b>test</b> (sex- and age-adjusted hazard ratio = 1. 8, p < 0. 05) and the incidence of AD was 18. 2 % in this subgroup. Combining the <b>cube</b> copying <b>test</b> with either rCBF or CSF Abeta(42) had additive effects on the risk assessment for future development of AD. MCI patients achieving high scores on both MMSE and <b>cube</b> copying <b>test</b> had a very low risk of developing AD (incidence of AD = 1. 6 %). Conclusion: In conclusion, combinations of the <b>cube</b> copying <b>test</b> with MMSE, rCBF and CSF Abeta(42) measurements can identify subgroups of MCI subjects with either substantially reduced or increased risk for future development of AD...|$|R

In continuous decompression, typically a fixed number of free variables are used to encode each <b>test</b> <b>cube</b> in a “one-size-fits-all ” manner.

Most of the time, one of the cubes corresponds to the net of the cube shown; sometimes none of the 2 options do. There are 25 minutes for 36 cubes. This test is particularly designed to test the left-right coordination, because the nets/areas of the shown cube normally consist of white, orange and blue areas, but especially they consist of arrows, which show into various directions. As one puts the model together, one must particularly decide into which direction the arrows of the constructed cube show.|$|E
50|$|Evaluations for aquagenic {{urticaria}} {{consist of}} a clinical history and water challenge test. The standard test for aquagenic urticaria is application of a 35°C water compress to the upper body for 30 minutes. Water of any temperature can provoke aquagenic urticaria; however, keeping the compress at room temperature avoids confusion with cold-induced or local heat urticaria. In addition, a forearm or hand can be immersed in water of varying temperatures. A diagnosis of aquagenic urticaria requires exclusion {{of other types of}} physical urticaria, so an exercise test and ice <b>cube</b> <b>test</b> should be performed to rule out other types of physical urticarial. aquagenic urticaria should be distinguished from aquagenic pruritus, in which brief contact with water evokes intense itching without wheals or erythema. The pathogenesis of aquagenic urticaria is not fully known; however, several mechanisms have been proposed. Interaction with water with a component in or on the stratum corneum or sebum, generating a toxic compound, has been suggested. Absorption of this substance would exert an effect of perifollicular mast cell degranulation with release of histamine.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the effect of various {{polypropylene}} fibre additions (types and volume) to concrete with regard to explosive spalling when subject to high temperatures similar to those experienced in building or tunnel fires. Design/methodology/approach – Medium strength concrete was manufactured with varying proportions of polypropylene fibres. Plain control samples were used to determine the original concrete strength and this was used as a benchmark following high temperature heat tests to evaluate the surface condition and final compressive strength. A pilot study was used to determine an appropriate heat source for the test. This was three Bunsen burners, however sufficient heat could not be generated within 150 mm concrete cubes and the concrete was shown to be a significant insulator and fire protection for structural members. The concrete <b>test</b> <b>cubes</b> were <b>tested</b> in a saturated condition which may reflect conditions where concrete is used in an external environment and thus is subject to soaking. Findings – One hundred and fifty millimetre concrete cubes with and without fibres were placed into a furnace at 1, 000 °C. Explosive spalling was shown to be reduced with the use of polypropylene fibres but the final compressive strength of concrete was significantly reduced and had little residual structural value after a two hour period of heating. Research limitations/implications – As the concrete tested was saturated, this condition provided a worst case scenario with regards to the build up of hydrostatic and vapour pressure within the cube. A range of percentage moisture contents would produce a more evenly balanced view of the effects of fibres in concrete. A single grade of concrete was used for the test. As the permeability of concrete influences the rate at which steam can escape from the interior of a saturated concrete <b>cube,</b> <b>testing</b> a range of concrete strengths would show this aspect of material performance with regard to spalling and final residual strength. Further research is recommended with regard to moisture contents, strengths of concrete and a range of temperatures...|$|R

Due to the complex load condition that exists in HWB structure, as compared to traditional aircraft configurations, light-weight, cost-effective and manufacturable structural concepts are required to enable the HWB. The Pultruded Rod Stitched Efficient Unitized Structure (PRSEUS) concept is one such structural concept. A building block approach for technology development of the PRSEUS concept is being conducted.
