5|$|On 8 April 1954, Comet G-ALYY ("Yoke Yoke"), on {{charter to}} South African Airways, {{was on a}} leg from Rome to Cairo (of a longer route, SA Flight 201 from London to Johannesburg), when it crashed in the Mediterranean near Naples {{with the loss of}} all 21 {{passengers}} and crew on board. The Comet fleet was immediately grounded once again and a large investigation board was formed {{under the direction of the}} Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE). Prime Minister Winston Churchill tasked the Royal Navy with helping to locate and retrieve the wreckage so that the cause of the accident could be determined. The Comet's <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Airworthiness</b> was revoked and Comet 1 line production was suspended at the Hatfield factory while the BOAC fleet was permanently grounded, cocooned and stored.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{long period}} of uneventful {{development}} flying trials and the fitting of a modified Proteus 765 series engine that greatly reduced breakdowns, a full <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Airworthiness</b> was awarded at the end of 1955. The first two Model 102s were delivered to BOAC on 30 December 1955 for crew training. The Model 102 began scheduled service on 1 February 1957 with a BOAC flight from London to Johannesburg, flights to Sydney following in March and to Tokyo in July. By August 1957, the first 15 Model 102 aircraft had been delivered to BOAC. The last 10 aircraft of the order were built as Series 300 aircraft for transatlantic flights. In April 1959, a Model 102 Britannia was leased by BOAC to Ghana Airways for flights between Accra and London, and several more Britannias were purchased by the airline in the early 1960s. The Model 102 was eventually made available to other BOAC associates, including Cathay Pacific, Central Africa, East African, Nigeria and Malayan airlines.|$|E
5|$|The Comet 4 first flew on 27 April 1958 and {{received}} its <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Airworthiness</b> on 24 September 1958; {{the first was}} delivered to BOAC the next day. The base price of a new Comet 4 was around £1,140,000, equivalent to £ in today's pounds. The Comet 4 enabled BOAC to inaugurate the first regular jet-powered transatlantic services on 4 October 1958 between London and New York (albeit still requiring a fuel stop at Gander International Airport, Newfoundland, on westward North Atlantic crossings). While BOAC gained publicity as the first to provide transatlantic jet service, {{by the end of}} the month rival Pan American World Airways was flying the Boeing 707 on the same route, and in 1960 the Douglas DC-8 as well. The American jets were larger, faster, longer-ranged, and more cost-effective than the Comet. After analysing route structures for the Comet, BOAC reluctantly cast about for a successor, and in 1956 entered into an agreement with Boeing to purchase the 707.|$|E

5|$|The {{accident}} {{aircraft was}} a four-engine de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7 Series 102, with serial number 28, built in 1980. It was bought used by Widerøe in 1985 and registered as LN-WFN on 8 November 1985.

50|$|As on the SE-3101, {{differential}} pitch {{settings of}} the twin tail rotors compensated main rotor torque; there were mechanical linkages between the collective pitch, the throttle and the tail pitch control to lower the pilot's workload. Directional control was achieved by altering the tail pitch difference and the tail could be lifted or depressed, giving longitudinal control (aircraft pitch), in the same way. A new feature on the SE-3110 was longitudinal trim control via the main rotor cyclic pitch. The SE.3110 first flew on 10 June 1950, piloted by Jaques Lacarme. Gaillard states that the first prototype made only two flights at low altitude before being abandoned in favour of the SE-3120 Alouette I. However, other sources say that two SE-3110s were built, appearing on the French civil register initially as F-WFUD and F-WFUE, later transferring to the B list (after gaining their <b>Certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>Airworthiness)</b> as F-BFUD and F-BFUE. In Liron's account the first prototype was retained for ground durability testing but the first flight of the second prototype on 15 September 1950 rapidly ended with loss of control and a side-on crash, though Lacarme walked away. SNCASE decided the way forward lay with the single tail rotor and with main rotor blades stabilized to prevent excessive flapping, both features of the SE-3120.|$|R
