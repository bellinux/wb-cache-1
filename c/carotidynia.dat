5000|$|<b>Carotidynia</b> is a {{syndrome}} {{characterized by}} unilateral (one-sided) tenderness of the carotid artery, near the bifurcation. It was first described in 1927 by Temple Fay. [...] The {{most common cause}} of <b>carotidynia</b> may be migraine, and then it is usually self-correcting. Common migraine treatments may help alleviate the <b>carotidynia</b> symptoms. Recent histological evidence has implicated an inflammatory component of <b>carotidynia,</b> but studies are limited. Carotid arteritis is a much less common cause of <b>carotidynia,</b> but has much more serious consequences. It is a form of giant cell arteritis, which is a condition that usually affects arteries in the head. Due to this serious condition possibly causing <b>carotidynia,</b> and the possibility that neck pain is related to some other non-carotidynia and serious condition, the case should be investigated by a medical doctor. [...] Because <b>carotidynia</b> can be caused by numerous causes, Biousse and Bousser in 1994 recommended the term not be used in the medical literature. However, recent MRI and ultrasound studies have supported the existence of a differential diagnosis of <b>carotidynia</b> consistent with Fay's characterization.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: <b>Carotidynia</b> is an {{idiopathic}} syndrome {{characterized by}} pain over the carotid bifurcation without associated luminal pathologic process. The classification of <b>carotidynia</b> {{as a distinct}} disease {{rather than as a}} symptom has generated controversy in the literature. Recent reports, however, suggest that <b>carotidynia</b> is a distinct disease characterized by the presence of enhancing soft tissue in the carotid sheath. We describe findings of <b>carotidynia</b> on positron-emission tomography and CT that further support the classification of <b>carotidynia</b> as a distinct inflammatory disease. <b>Carotidynia,</b> as described by Fay 1 in 1927 and by the Inter-national Headache Society (IHS) 2 in 1988, is an idiopathic neck pain syndrome characterized by radiating pain and ten-derness over the common carotid bifurcation without appar-ent structural abnormality of the carotid artery. The classifica-tion of <b>carotidynia</b> has been controversial, with some authors suggesting that <b>carotidynia</b> is merely a symptom referable to multiple causes of neck pain rather than a clinically distinct disease. 3, 4 This controversy in the literature led to the removal of <b>carotidynia</b> as a clinically distinct entity from the IHS head...|$|E
40|$|Idiopathic <b>carotidynia</b> or Fay {{syndrome}} {{is a little}} known pathology, which in the past {{was the subject of}} much controversy. Even though carotydinia was removed as a pathological entity from the second International Headache Society classification in 2004, recent reports seem to confirm that the disease demonstrates unusual radiological findings. The presence of a typical amorphous enhancing soft tissue surrounding the carotid artery by MRI, CT and ultrasonography in patients with <b>carotidynia</b> has reopened discussion on the hypothesis that <b>carotidynia</b> may represent a distinctive inflammatory process. The aetiology of <b>carotidynia</b> is unknown. We report a case of <b>carotidynia</b> that developed after an upper airway infection, wherein MR studies demonstrated typical enhanced tissue surrounding the common carotid artery in contiguity with pathological enhancement in laryngeal tissue...|$|E
40|$|Abstract <b>Carotidynia</b> is a {{condition}} characterized by tenderness of the carotid artery and ipsilateral neck pain, eventually aggravated by head movements, swallowing, coughing and sneezing.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <b>Carotidynia</b> is an {{idiopathic}} neck pain syndrome associ-ated with tenderness to palpation {{over the}} carotid bifurcation. Although {{well known in}} the otolaryngology and neurology literature, the validity of the entity has recently been questioned, {{in part because of the}} almost uniform absence of radiologic or pathologic findings. We report the MR findings in five patients with <b>carotidynia.</b> METHODS: During a period of 44 months, five patients with clinical signs and symptoms consistent with <b>carotidynia</b> were referred for imaging from the otolaryngology service. Each patient underwent MR imaging of the neck on a 1. 5 -T system. The studies included, as a minimum, pre- and postcontrast axial and postcontrast coronal T 1 -weighted images. Two pa-tients also had axial T 2 -weighted imaging and another two patients underwent duplex sonog-raphy of the carotids. RESULTS: All five patients had abnormal enhancing tissue surrounding the symptomatic carotid artery centered at the level of the distal common carotid and carotid bifurcation. This tissue had intermediate signal intensity on T 1 -weighted images and showed marked enhance-ment. In all patients, the remaining visualized portions of the carotid artery were normal. Normal flow voids were present throughout the vessel, and the caliber of the vessels was always within normal limits. There was no evidence of intramural hematoma, cervical lymphadenop-athy, or atherosclerotic disease of the vessel. In one patient, repeat imaging after resolution of symptoms showed an absence of the previous abnormality. CONCLUSION: The MR findings in these patients, along with the lack of any findings to suggest alternative diagnoses, support the existence of <b>carotidynia</b> as a distinct clinical entity. <b>Carotidynia</b> is an idiopathic neck pain syndrome associated with tenderness to palpation over the ca-rotid bifurcation. The syndrome was initially de-scribed by Fay (1) in 1927 and since then has been the subject of numerous reports in the otolaryn-gology and neurology literature, some including hundreds of patients (1 – 6). Nevertheless, with the exception of a single case report in 1997 (7), there have been no reports describing the imaging find-ings of <b>carotidynia.</b> We report the MR findings in five patients with <b>carotidynia...</b>|$|E

As such, it may be encountered in surgery practice when analysing carotid artery status in symptomatic patients. Here, a case is presented which outlines the diagnostic process and subsequent treatment of <b>carotidynia.</b> As opposed to vascular causes of unilateral neck pain, <b>carotidynia</b> can be easily treated conservatively.

40|$|SUMMARY: We {{present a}} case of <b>carotidynia</b> that was imaged with 3 techniques: sonography, CT angiography, and gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging. We {{describe}} a previously unreported finding, the resolution of an intimal plaque noted on imaging {{at the time of}} initial presentation, presumably due to changes induced by the healing phase of the carotid inflammatory process. <b>Carotidynia</b> is an unusual cause of vascular neck pain. Find-ings on sonography, CT, and MR imaging may support this diagnosis in the appropriate clinical context. We present a unique case of <b>carotidynia</b> with resolution of an existing inti-mal plaque that was imaged with 3 techniques: sonography, CT angiography (CTA), and gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging. Case Report A 46 -year-old man presented with a 1 -week history of right-neck pain. This was preceded by a flulike illness with low-grade fever, chills, fatigue, and myalgia.

40|$|<b>Carotidynia</b> is a {{syndrome}} {{characterized by}} tenderness of the carotid artery near the bifurcation due to numerous, heterogeneous causes. Here we reported {{the case of}} a 31 -year-old Moroccan woman with right-sided neck pain and tenderness with irradiation to ipsilateral ear, eye, and occipital region. Clinical symptoms and imaging findings were suggestive of primary variant of <b>carotidynia</b> syndrome. In particular, color-Doppler ultrasonography revealed a concentric wall thickening of the distal common carotid artery, while thoracic magnetic resonance showed localized perivascular enhancement of the soft tissue in the right medial-distal common carotid artery in T 1 -weighted images, without intraluminal diameter variation. Moreover, careful clinicoserological and imaging investigations (cranial, cervical, and thoracic angiocomputed tomography and magnetic resonance) excluded well-known disorders potentially responsible for <b>carotidynia</b> syndrome. The patient was scarcely responsive to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but clinical symptoms resolved after three months. Of interest, the patient showed latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (positive tuberculosis interferon-gamma release assay; QuantiFERON-TB Gold); this finding suggested a possible triggering role of mycobacterial antigens in the immune-mediated mechanism responsible for localized carotid injury...|$|E
40|$|<b>Carotidynia</b> {{is a form}} of {{vascular}} neck are face pain {{in which}} the vascular change occurs in the carotid artery in the neck. The disorder is not uncommon, and most patients have a prior history of migraine. They present with pain in the neck and face, and are often thought to have a disorder such as chronic sinusitis or trigeminal neuralgia. Diagnosis can be made from the type and location of the pain and the finding of a tender and swollen carotid artery on the same side. <b>Carotidynia</b> responds to the prophylactic medications used for migraine, often disappearing in weeks or months. In some patients the syndrome may become recurrent or chronic, with a variable response to medication...|$|E

40|$|Differential {{diagnosis}} of stylalgia is broad, and many causes {{should be taken}} into account, such as temporomandibular joint disorders, <b>carotidynia,</b> compression of nerve fibers by neo- plasms, cranial nerve neuralgias, chronic pharyngotonsillitis, pharyngeal or base of tongue tumors and elongation of styloid process, or Eagle syndrome. Basicranium malformation can determine a rare form of stylalgia that is caused by dislocation of styloid process. This can produce a reduction of maxillo-vertebropharyngeal space and irritation of nerve fibers together with stylopharyngeal muscular chronic contraction. This case report illustrates the diagnostic dilemma and surgical strategy experienced in a rare case of stylalgia caused by a dislocation of styloid process produced by a basicranium malformation. Basicranium malformation should be considered in the pathogenesis of stylalgia when a styloid process with normal dimension is encountered...|$|E
30|$|The complex {{anatomy of}} the carotid space within a small {{confined}} area is unique to {{the head and neck}} and allows for a vast array of pathology. This paper will review the {{anatomy of the}} carotid space from the skull base to the thorax, defining its borders at multiple levels, as well as its contents. The paper will also describe the myriad of mass lesions and vascular pathologies that may occur within the carotid space. The discussion will include anatomic considerations in differential diagnoses, imaging features, and lesion characteristics across multiple imaging modalities including CT, MRI, ultrasound, and conventional angiography. Entities discussed include paragangliomas, nerve sheath tumors, meningioma, fibromuscular dysplasia, <b>carotidynia,</b> thrombus, dissection, pseudoaneurysm, and pathology of the deep cervical chain lymph nodes. Understanding the complex and unique anatomy of the carotid space, as well as the nuances of navigating a broad differential, will empower the reader to make an accurate diagnosis.|$|E
40|$|Idiopathic <b>carotidynia</b> (IC) is a {{rare and}} poorly {{understood}} syndrome consisting of unilateral neck pain, tenderness, and increased pulsations over the affected carotid bifurcation. A {{growing body of evidence}} supports the hypothesis that IC is a distinct clinicopathologic entity with characteristic imaging features. We report the case of a 34 -year-old Caucasian male presenting with intense unilateral neck pain in the emergency setting. Computed tomography and ultrasonography revealed fusiform eccentric thickening of the ipsilateral carotid bifurcation without vessel narrowing. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging depicted major perivascular enhancement without evidence of dissection. Further imaging and laboratory work-up excluded vasculitis. The diagnosis of IC was made. The patient was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and symptoms and imaging findings disappeared within a few weeks. Cross-sectional imaging allows not only ruling out IC mimickers but also making the correct diagnosis of this rare condition, in particular, as the clinical presentation of IC is often nonspecific...|$|E
40|$|Takayasu {{arteritis}} (TA) is {{an uncommon}} disease of young women, characterized by granulomatous vasculi-tis of medium and large arteries. In addition to constitu-tional symptoms, it causes various clinical morbidities, such as arm claudication, decreased arterial pulses, <b>carotidynia</b> and hypertension. The incidence rate of TA has wide variation in different geographical areas. It was calculated to be 0. 12 cases/ 100, 000 / year in Sweden, 0. 22 in Kuwait, 0. 26 in USA, and probably higher in Japan. Neurological involvement is reported {{in only a}} minority of patients and occurrence of neurolo-gical syndromes as the first manifestation of disease has been rarely reported. We present clinical, laboratory and imaging findings of a 50 years old lady with TA, who was initially presented by clinical manifestations mimicking a stroke. Of particular importance is the occurrence of intracranial arterial stenosis in the patient, which is a relatively rare condition. The rarity of the disease and especially such a presentation can cause considerable delay in the diagnosis and treatment...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Carotid endarterectomy {{has become}} a widely used {{approach}} {{to the treatment of}} cerebrovas-cular disease. In spite of increasing experience, a significant and varied morbidity remains attached to the procedure. A poorly recognized complication is postoperative headache. In a series of 57 endarterectomies in 50 patients, 24 patients experienced postoperative headaches encom-passing the entire spectrum of vascular headaches: nonspecific diffuse headaches, severe hemicranias, cluster headaches occurring early and delayed, chronic paroxysmal hemicranias, <b>carotidynia,</b> and Eagle's syndrome. Five patients had hemicranias, and all were homolateral to the endarterectomy. Therefore, we hypothesize that the spontaneously occurring hemicranias, the counterparts of postsurgical headache syndromes, also may be due to some overt or occult injury or disease of the carotid vessels or carotid sheaths in the region from the carotid bifurcation {{to the base of the}} skull. STENOTIC LESIONS of the common carotid artery or the internal carotid artery near the bifurcation are well recognized causes of cerebrovascular ischemia. Carotid endarterectomy is gaining increasing recogni-tion as a surgical approach in the prophylaxis an...|$|E
40|$|Takayasu {{arteritis}} (TA) is {{a chronic}} large vessel vasculitis that affects aorta, its main branches and pulmonary arteries. the inflammatory process results in stenosis, occlusion, dilation or aneurysm {{formation in the}} arterial wall. TA has been described {{in different parts of}} the world and affects predominantly young individuals (< 50 years of age). Patients with TA may present constitutional symptoms, vascular pain (e. g. <b>carotidynia)</b> and typical features such as limb claudication, decreased or absent peripheral pulses, vascular bruits, hypertension, and reduction or discrepancies in blood pressure between arms. A proper diagnosis of TA is an important issue since delays may result in significant morbidity. the definition of TA was included in the 1994 and 2012 Chapel Hill Consensus Conference and TA was categorized as a large vessel vasculitis. the first diagnostic criteria for TA were developed by Ishikawa in 1988 and modified by Sharma et al., in 1995. Two sets of classification criteria were developed for TA to include patients in epidemiologic studies and clinical trials: the 1990 ACR Classification Criteria for TA and the Classification Criteria for childhood TA proposed by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), the Pediatric Rheumatology European Society (PRES) and by the Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization (PRINTO) to be used for patients younger than 18 years. the Diagnostic and Classification Criteria in Vasculitis Study (DCVAS) is an international effort that is under way to develop a single classification system and a validated set of diagnostic criteria for systemic vasculitides using data-driven methods.
