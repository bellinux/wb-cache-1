25|$|The <b>cognitive</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{involved}} in the Stroop task {{is referred to as}} directed attention. The Stroop task requires the participant to engage in and allows assessment of processes such as attention management, speed and accuracy of reading words and colours and of inhibition of competing stimuli. The stimulus is a colour word that is printed in a different colour than what the written word reads. For example, the word “red” is written in a blue font. One must verbally classify the colour that the word is displayed/printed in, while ignoring the information provided by the written word. In the aforementioned example, this would require the participant to say “blue” when presented with the stimulus. Although the majority of people will show some slowing when given incompatible text versus font colour, this is more severe in individuals with deficits in inhibition. The Stroop task takes advantage of the fact that most humans are so proficient at reading colour words that it is extremely difficult to ignore this information, and instead acknowledge, recognize and say the colour the word is printed in. The Stroop task is an assessment of attentional vitality and flexibility. More modern variations of the Stroop task tend to be more difficult and often try to limit the sensitivity of the test.|$|E

5000|$|The philosopher Mark Johnson {{discusses}} Kant's {{conception of}} a schema with respect to developing a theory of the imagination within cognitive science.

He proposes that we use imaginative schemata to structure abstract concepts largely in terms a set of spatial analogies he calls image schemata. In Johnson's view, we acquire image schemata primarily from recurrent patterns of experiences in infancy and early childhood, and then reuse these image schemata in a metaphoric fashion both to reason abstractly and as we speak our language.|$|E

These refined god-beliefs are co-opted by evolutionary processes and are cultural adaptations.

5000|$|The {{definition}} of module has caused confusion and dispute. J. A. Fodor initially defined module as [...] "functionally specialized cognitive systems" [...] that have nine features {{but not necessarily}} {{all at the same}} time. In his views modules can be found in peripheral processing such as low-level visual processing but not in central processing. Later he narrowed the two essential features to domain-specificity and information encapsulation. Frankenhuis and Ploeger write that domain-specificity means that [...] "a given <b>cognitive</b> <b>mechanism</b> accepts, or is specialized to operate on, only a specific class of information". Information encapsulation means that information processing in the module cannot be affected by information {{in the rest of the}} brain. One example is that being aware that a certain optical illusion, caused by low level processing, is false does not prevent the illusion from persisting.|$|E
50|$|A recent Psychological Bulletin {{suggests}} that illusory superiority (as {{well as other}} biases) {{can be explained by}} a simple information-theoretic generative mechanism that assumes a noisy conversion of objective evidence (observation) into subjective estimates (judgment). The study {{suggests that}} the underlying <b>cognitive</b> <b>mechanism</b> is essentially similar to the noisy mixing of memories that can cause the conservatism bias or overconfidence: after our own performance, we readjust our estimates of our own performance more than we readjust our estimates of others' performances. This implies that our estimates of the scores of others are even more conservative (more influenced by the previous expectation) than our estimates of our own performance (more influenced by the new evidence received after giving the test). The difference in the conservative bias of both estimates (conservative estimate of our own performance, and even more conservative estimate of the performance of others) is enough to create illusory superiority. Since mental noise is a sufficient explanation that is much simpler and straightforward than any other explanation involving heuristics, behavior, or social interaction, Occam's razor would argue in its favor as the underlying generative mechanism (it is the hypothesis which makes the fewest assumptions).|$|E
40|$|Contagion, Empathy and Theory of Mind (ToM) are {{important}} social <b>cognitive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that develop gradually in human ontogeny, enabling humans {{to interact with}} other human beings in a complex manner. However, the development of <b>cognitive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for early social interaction is still underexplored. Therefore, {{the aim of the}} current paper is to investigate these mechanisms in a broader range from a theoretical as well as empirical perspective. In particular, we propose a musiccentered approach, which allows us to investigate <b>cognitive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of social interaction independently of children’s language skills in a musical joint action setting. In our theoretical part, we delineate the social <b>cognitive</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> namely contagion, empathy and ToM. Especially, we suggest emergence of joint attention around nine months in ontogeny as a mile stone of the social cognitive development. Further, we propose that joint attentional skills scaffold empathy and ToM and are necessary to enable complex social communicative behaviors such as joint action. Our empirical part focuses on joint attentional behaviors and explores these in musical joint action of children of different age-groups (1. 5 – 2. 5 y; 3 – 4 y; 5 – 6 y) by using structured observation of video-recordings. The observation session takes place in a regular lesson of music education for young children, which includes interactive clapping, dancing and other rhythmic and musical gestures under the guidance of a tutor. Results of analyzing indicators of social interactions such as gaze following, mimicry, gestures, and intra- and inter-individual synchronization will be presented. It is claimed that investigating musical joint action provides a new possibility to explore how increasingly complex social <b>cognitive</b> <b>mechanisms</b> emerge in human ontogeny in social communicative behaviors across a wide range of age and adds to current methods in social cognitive neuroscience...|$|R

5000|$|Several {{theories}} {{have been put}} forward about what cognitive processes the P3b reflects. Donchin proposed a [...] "context updating model". This model posits that the brain constantly and automatically generates hypotheses about the environment {{and what it is}} about to experience. A P300 wave, including a P3b, is generated when the brain receives information that indicates that it needs to change these hypotheses, or update its mental model of the world. In other words, a P300 is elicited whenever there is sufficient information to indicate that the brain needs to update working memory. [...] Though the [...] "context updating" [...] account is well supported by existing research, several alternative {{theories have}} been proposed. For example, Verleger and colleagues (2005) have proposed that the P3b component reflects a process that mediates between perceptual analysis and response initiation. More specifically, this process emerges from a <b>cognitive</b> <b>mechanism</b> responsible for monitoring whether the classification of a stimulus is appropriately translated into action.) [...] This theory constitutes a direct challenge to the widely held view that the P3b component reflects processes involved in perception but not response initiation (see Verleger, 1997).|$|E
5000|$|There is {{evidence}} that numerical cognition is intimately related to other aspects of thought - particularly spatial cognition. One line of evidence comes from studies performed on number-form synaesthetes. Such individuals report that numbers are mentally represented with a particular spatial layout; others experience numbers as perceivable objects that can be visually manipulated to facilitate calculation. Behavioral studies further reinforce the connection between numerical and spatial cognition. For instance, participants respond quicker to larger numbers if they are responding {{on the right side}} of space, and quicker to smaller numbers when on the left—the so-called [...] "Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Codes" [...] or SNARC effect. This effect varies across culture and context, however, and some research has even begun to question whether the SNARC reflects an inherent number-space association, instead invoking strategic problem solving or a more general <b>cognitive</b> <b>mechanism</b> like conceptual metaphor. Moreover, neuroimaging studies reveal that the association between number and space also shows up in brain activity. Regions of the parietal cortex, for instance, show shared activation for both spatial and numerical processing. These various lines of research suggest a strong, but flexible, connection between numerical and spatial cognition.|$|E
