While conventional tactile sensing devices typically provide information concerning the spatial distribution of normal pressures, the intrinsic contact sensing system presented in this text only measures the three components of the contact force and two components of the resultant torque. These five parameters are shown to be sufficient to estimate the location of the contact point and hence the orientation of the local contact surface. Such information can then be used by the crawler’s control system for the real-time computation of an optimized foot force distribution.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{crawling}} locomotion based on directional frictional interactions, namely, frictional {{forces that are}} sensitive to the sign of the sliding velocity. Surface interactions of this type are common in biology, where they arise from the presence of inclined hairs or scales at the crawler/substrate interface, leading to low resistance when sliding 'along the grain', and high resistance when sliding 'against the grain'. This asymmetry can be exploited for locomotion, in a way analogous to what is done in cross-country skiing (classic style, diagonal stride). We focus on a model system, namely, a continuous one-dimensional crawler and provide a detailed study of the motion resulting from several strategies of shape change. In particular, we provide explicit formulae for the displacements attainable with reciprocal extensions and contractions (breathing), or through the propagation of extension or contraction waves.

40|$|Wheeled {{vehicles}} or robots {{can achieve}} high speed locomotion {{with a relatively}} lower control complexity compared to other forms such as legged, hopping, or slithering robots. However, wheeled vehicles have several limitations on rough and uneven surfaces. For instance, wheel robots are much speedier than legged counterpart, but wheeled rope climbing robots {{are supposed to have}} very smooth ropes. Moreover, wheels come into contact with all details of the terrain causing higher energy losses in friction. More specifically, this causes higher losses on soft contact surfaces like a slacked rope. "Development of a multipurpose rope climbing robot" research is mainly focusing on developing a rope climbing robot that can be applied in various practical situations. Objective of this research is to design a four legged rope climbing robot that smoothly and steadily moves on a rope. Different mechanisms such as wheeled <b>robot,</b> brachalion <b>robot,</b> <b>crawling</b> type <b>robots</b> and different kind of legged robots have been developed to achieve this target and they have their own advantages and disadvantages. The proposed robot is a four legged robot and each leg has two degrees of freedom. One degree of freedom to rotate the leg forward and backward and second degree of freedom is for grip the rope by each leg. This robot is always grip the rope very steadily and moves on rope very smoothly. These two characteristics are important to carry a weight with a robot and easily can maintain an overall stability of the robot. The robot is planned to work on various situations {{and the nature of the}} rope or characteristics such as size of the rope, whether the rope vertical or horizontal directional and whether the rope is having some obstacles like knots or bend at some points on the rope. The robot is planned to have, the design is simple as possible and overall cost is minimized for use the robot in practical situations.

40|$|The {{development}} of wall climbing robots is relatively recent, beginning with some large scale robots {{in the early}} 1990 s. Wall climbing robots {{can be used to}} gain access to or inspect space that is not easily accessible or dangerous for human operators. The range of applicable fields encompasses industrial processes and inspection, exploration, rescue and monitoring. The smaller robots can be used for surveillance purposes due to their stealthy nature. Larger <b>crawling</b> <b>robots</b> may be used to carry out specific tasks such as sand blasting of ship hulls and blasting and spray painting of large containers such as cylindrical storage tanks used by the chemical, petroleum and nuclear industries. Their flexibility and mobility mean that they can accomplish tasks that would be impossible for more conventional robots. The flexibility of mobility that such robots gain from their ability to move on all surfaces rather than only horizontal ones creates some unique challenges. Broadly, they can be split into three categories: robot design, robot control and motion planning, and environmental mapping and localisation. This thesis examines the first two of these problems. A prototype bipedal robot has been built and a second designed in order to capitalise on the experience gained with the first. An in-depth examination of the motion planning problem has been made and new techniques to tackle this problem have been developed. Such techniques are not limited to applications with wall climbing robots as there is commonality with more traditional fixed manipulators. Finally, the planning techniques were combined with the robot design in a test scenario that validated both the design and the motion planning techniques developed throughout the dissertation...|$|R
