2500|$|At {{around midnight}} on November 7, 1881, Miller was {{drinking}} at Dick Darling's Broadway saloon {{with several of}} his friends including Bill Bowie, George Law Jr., Harry Rice, Charles Crawford and Billy Temple. After an hour, Tracy was seen peeking into the saloon from the front entrance. A few minutes later, he reentered the saloon and {{walked up to the}} bar to order a whiskey sour. He then turned to Miller and said [...] "I <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> to kill you" [...] before drawing a revolver and pointing it at his head before shooting him in the stomach. Miller reached for his pistol but collapsed onto the floor. Miller was taken by ambulance to the New York Hospital where he died from his wounds shortly after his arrival. Tracy was arrested and tried for his murder, however he was found not guilty due to perjured testimony and returned to running his saloon.|$|E
