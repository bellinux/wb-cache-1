The {{study was conducted in}} Livestock Farmers Group, Pinrang Regency, and in the Laboratory of Technology and Feed Industry Faculty of Animal Science, Hasanuddin University, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The materials used were the samples of ten (10) types of animal feed ingredients, and each sample approximately 30 kg. The materials of feedstuffs used were divided into 4 (four) groups based on their function in the ration. In this study, the observed variables were the physical characteristics of the feed material including angle of repose, bulk density and <b>compacted</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>density.</b> Measurements of physical properties of the each feedstuff were conducted and repeated 20 (twenty) times.

Packaging is the one of methods to take care product. Damage by environment can be controlled by packaging. This study was arranged in a Completely Randomize Design with factorial design (4 x 5) with four replications. The first factor was packaging type (guny sack, plastic sack, paper packaging, and plastic packaging). The second factor was storage (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 weeks). The parameters observed were: water content, water activity, particle size, specific density, bulk density, <b>compacted</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>density,</b> angle of repose and insect attack. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and differences between treatments were determined with Duncan test. The results showed that packaging type highly significantly affected (p< 0. 01) the moisture content, water activity, and <b>compacted</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>density.</b> Storage highly significantly affected (p< 0. 01) the moisture content, water activity, particle size, specific density, bulk density, <b>compacted</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>density,</b> and angle of repose.

The influence of compacted layers or pans on plant growth and development, although much studied, is not clearly understood. This greenhouse experiment evaluated {{the influence of}} uniformly compacted soil and thin layers of compacted soil placed at various depths on early growth of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Artificially compacted soil [Alliance silt loam, Aridic Argiustoll (Eluviated Brown Chernozem); A horizon] profiles were constructed in polyvinyl chloride tubes of 150 -mm diameter by 350 mm long. Treatments were: (1) uniformly noncompacted (bulk density 1. 30 Mg m- 3) soil; (2) uniformly <b>compacted</b> (<b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> 1. 80 Mg m- 1) soil; (3) a <b>compacted</b> (<b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> 1. 80 Mg m- 3) soil layer at 100 - to 120 -mm depth with the remaining soil noncompacted (bulk density 1. 30 Mg m- 3); or (4) a <b>compacted</b> (<b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> 1. 80 Mg m- 3) soil layer at 180 - to 200 -mm depth with the remaining soil noncompacted (bulk density 1. 30 Mg m- 3). Generally, winter wheat grown in cores that were uniformly compacted or compacted in the upper layer responded similarly. Plant height, {{at the end of}} the experiment (32 d after planting), for the uniformly compacted and upper compacted layer treatments was 280 mm, compared to 323 mm for the control (uniformly noncompacted). Leaf area development was similar to the response indicated for plant height throughout the growth period. Root mass and length tended to be less in layered or compacted soil than in noncompacted soil. Roots accumulated within or immediately above compacted soil layers. Higher bulk density or a shallow compacted layer produced winter wheat with reduced height, leaf area, and dry matter compared with soil of normal density or with a deeper compacted layer...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{reduction}} of maize as starch source on flow rate of pellet in continuous production process ABSTRACT. This experience {{was conducted to}} determine effect of reduction of maize as starch source on flow rate of pellet in continuous production process. Design of the experiment used was a completely randomized design with 3 treatments and 3 replicates. The data is analyzed by using of ANOVA {{and if there is}} a significance among treatments would tested using by contrast orthogonal. The variables observed were angle of repose, loose bulk density, <b>compacted</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>density,</b> and flow rate. The results showed that the reduction of maize as starch source did not give the significant effect on the variable that observed. The analyzed angle of repose showed variation 24. 200 to 25. 690, loose bulk density showed variation 621. 6 kg/m 3 to 658 kg/m 3, <b>compacted</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> showed variation 668. 3 kg/m 3 to 676. 8 kg/m 3, and flow rate showed variation 449. 69 kg/minute to 491. 41 kg/minute. Based on the result that the reduction of maize as starch source (corn, sorghum, menir) did not give the significant effect on flow rate of pellet and the pellet treatment with menir has the fastest pellet production time so flowability pellet from pelleter to material hadling (bucket elevator) machine is faster.

Fresh mussel samples were collected from four different lakes in West Sumatra: Maninjau, Singkarak, Danau Diatas and Danau Dibawah. The samples of about 3 kg each were processed to separate the shell and their body content. The shells were then dried and processed to produce three different products: raw coarse ground, raw fine ground and roasted fine ground. Parameters measured included: percent rate of meal, the content of DM, ash, Ca and P, and physical properties (angle of response, bulk and compacted bulk densities and specific density). The results showed that grinding and roasting gave no significant effect on specific density and mineral content of the meal product.

40|$|Two {{international}} {{interlaboratory trials}} {{for the analysis}} of growing media and soil improvers were performed. Samples of white sphagnum peat, coir dust, composted green material, uncomposted bark, peat mixture and a peat and clay mixture were tested. Of the materials the pH, electrical conductivity, organic matter content and ash, dry matter content, moisture content, laboratory <b>compacted</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>density,</b> dry bulk density, air volume, water volume, shrinkage value and total pore space were determined using European Standards. The results give an idea about the excitability and reliability of the methods. Results were variable. As a reference a test performed for European standardization was used. Results less good as obtained in the former trial were found for the pH of bark. This appeared to be a difficult material for the pH determination. Also the repeatability and reproducibility results of the organic matter determination of the peat and clay mixture were bad. This can either be caused by the fact that laboratories do not exactly follow the procedure, or the method is more reliable for high organic matter contents and should perhaps be adapted for materials with a low organic matter content. The laboratory <b>compacted</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> results of the performed test are in most cases satisfactory. The determination of physical parameters were not always good. The repeatability and reproducibility of dry bulk density of composted green material were extremely high. Probably due to the constitution of this compost, dry bulk density is difficult to determine. The method is not suitable for this type of material. Results for bark and peat and clay mixture are also rather poor. For particle density it appeared that some laboratories used another formula as prescribed. Next trial and an amendment will have to be made about how total pore space has to be calculated from particle density. For water and air volume the repeatability and reproducibility results of one of the interlaboratory trials were not good when compared to the former trial. There is not a clear reason but perhaps laboratories need to gain more experience for these determinations. The results show that it is essential to have interlaboratory trials for the physical and chemical characterization of growing media and soil improvers. The procedures still need further improvement. The only way to find out for a laboratory if it is producing the right data, is to participate in these trials.

Soil samples were equilibrated to three metric suctions and compacted by a series of static pressures. The semilog graphs of <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> versus pressure were linear over the range of applied stress and moisture content of the experiment. For the same soils but with different moisture content, the slopes of the graphs were parallel to each other. This indicates that the slope of the graph, the compression index, is independent of the moisture content. The data obtained in this study were used to check Larson's equation for predicting soil compaction.

Corymbia maculata, Lophostemon confertus, Platanus orientalis and Platanus X acerifolia were subjected to a period of waterlogging and then a recovery phase after waterlogging had ceased. Root length was measured {{at the end of the}} waterlogging phase, and at the end of the recovery phase. The different species were found to vary considerably in their ability to tolerate and recover from a period of waterlogging. Waterlogging suppressed shoot and root growth in all species trialed. Corymbia maculata, and Platanus orientalis were able to initiate new roots under waterlogged conditions. Platanus X acerifolia and Lophostemon confertus were not able to do this. Compaction trials were set up to test the hypothesis that trees which are able to establish in urban soils will have a higher than average tolerance to soil compaction and to the higher mechanical impedance and soil strength in dry compacted soils.

The {{aim of this}} study was to study modifications in the morphostructure and porosity of dystroferric Red Latosol (Oxisol) under conventional tillage and no-tillage over a 31 - year period. The study began with the description of soil profiles based on the cropping profile method, to identify the most compact structures, define sample collection points for physical and chemical analysis, and determine the water retention curve.

The results from two ratoon crops {{both of which were}} compacted, showed that both moderate and severe compaction over the cane row and the interrow caused a marked reduction in cane yield. Compaction of the interrow oply resulted in a less severe reduction in yield.

The study site was located about 1 km south of Corconnes town (~ 30 km northwest of Montpellier). The land use systems compared with each other were : undisturbed scrubland (garrigue – G), 25 -yr old fallow (F) with dense grass cover (Brachypodium retusum), young vineyard for 5 -yr (YV) with inter-row spaces bare of vegetation, and vineyard for 15 -yr (AV) mulched with dry vine shoots. The vineyard soils were more <b>compact</b> (<b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> ~ 1. 47 g/cc) which was attributed {{to the loss of}} the organic-rich mineral horizons and the influence of the heavy machinery used in initial clearing of the land and the subsequent vineyard production for several years. Despite the textural similarity, soils under the G and F had 6 to 7 times more macroaggregates (1 - 2 mm) than soils under the vineyards. All the ecosystems differed significantly from each other in organic C and N. Undisturbed soil under G had the maximum C (41. 8 mg/g) followed by the F system (30. 5 mg/g) while the intensely cultivated soil (YV) had the minimum C contents (5. 4 mg/g).

40|$|The <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> of a soil is a {{combination}} measure of the particle density and how tightly packed the particles are in the sample. Under ideal conditions, the <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> of a soil {{is a measure of}} soil pore space and can therefore provide important information on the degree of compaction on golf course greens. In this article, the theoretical basis behind the <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> measurement will be reviewed and its possible applications will be discussed through presentation of data recently generated at California golf courses. Theory Under ideal USGA specification greens construction conditions, a root zone sand will have 50 % total pore space and 50 % solid sand particles. The size of the pores are also important because a root is seldom smaller than 60 um (micro meters, 60 millionths of a meter) in diameter. If the pores are smaller than 60 um, the root must be able to move the particles out of its path (Adams and Gibbs, 1994). If the soil is too compacted, the root {{will not be able to}} penetrate the soil. The 1 / 4 inch hollow core aeration programs that have recently become more popular will greatly improve soil porosity and reduce <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> until the holes close and become <b>compacted</b> again. <b>Bulk</b> <b>density</b> alone, however, does not provide sufficient information to accurately determine the level of soil porosity and compaction. The particle density must also be known. Pure quartz has a density of 2. 65 g/cm 3 (grams per cubic centimeter, water weighs 1 g/cm 3 at standard temperature and pressure). Southern California silica sands also have a particle density of 2. 6 g/cm 3. However, some sands are composed of calcite (lime) materials that have a particle density of 2. 83 g/cm 3. And organic matter has a low particle density of about 1. 5 g/cm 3 (Carter, 1993). Each root zone mix will have a different particle density based on the ratios of these and other components to one another. Figure 1.

40|$|Background and aimsMacropores may be {{preferential}} root pathways {{into the}} subsoil. We hypothesised {{that the presence}} of macropores promotes P-uptake from subsoil, particularly at limited water supply in surface soil. We tested this hypothesis in a rhizotron experiment with spring wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Scirocco) under variation of fertilisation and irrigation. MethodsRhizotrons were filled with <b>compacted</b> subsoil (<b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> 1. 4 g cm− 3), underneath a P-depleted topsoil. In half of these rhizotrons the subsoil contained artificial macropores. Spring wheat was grown for 41 days with and without irrigation and 31 P–addition. Also, a 33 P–tracer was added at the soil surface to trace P-distribution in plants using liquid scintillation counting and radioactive imaging. ResultsFertilisation and irrigation promoted biomass production and plant P-uptake. Improved growing conditions resulted in a higher proportion of subsoil roots, indicating that the topsoil root system additionally promoted subsoil nutrient acquisition. The presence of macropores did not improve plant growth but tended to increase translocation of 33 P into both above- and belowground biomass. 33 P–imaging confirmed that this plant-internal transport of topsoil-P extended into subsoil roots. ConclusionsThe lack of penetration resistance in macropores did not increase plant growth and nutrient uptake from subsoil here; however, wheat specifically re-allocated topsoil-P for subsoil root growth...|$|R

40|$|A new {{ceramic powder}} {{preparation}} process, the droplet-powder granulation process (DPGP), was recently {{proposed for the}} cleaner production of ceramic tiles. The DPGP granules and resulting pressed compacts were characterized and compared with the granules and compacts obtained by spray-drying (SD) and dry granulation (G) processes in a previous paper. The results showed the feasibility of using the DPGP in the pre-firing stage of porcelain tile manufacture. This study compares the firing behaviour and fired properties of compacts pressed from three different types of granulated powders: DPGP, SD, and G and from a non-granulated powder (NG) obtained by dry milling. The evolution of compact microstructure (porosity and pore size distribution) with firing temperature was monitored and the fired <b>compact</b> properties (<b>bulk</b> <b>density,</b> water absorption, and stain resistance) were determined. The study shows that the DPGP improved the sintering behaviour and final properties of the resulting porcelain tiles with respect to those obtained by the G process. However, the fired compacts prepared from the DPGP powder exhibited a higher porosity and pore size {{compared with those of}} the compacts obtained from the SD granules at the same pressing pressure. The results obtained open up the possibility of manufacturing glazed porcelain tiles with a more eco-friendly process. However, the results also indicate that polished porcelain tile manufacture by the DPGP requires further research in order to improve granule characteristics, in particular green granule deformability, which is the critical factor in porcelain tile densification and vitrification during firing...|$|R
40|$|In the {{manufacture}} of ceramic components, near-net-shape parts are commonly formed by uniaxially pressing granulated powders in rigid dies. Density gradients that are introduced into a powder compact during press-forming often increase the cost of manufacturing, and can degrade the performance and reliability of the finished part. Finite element method (FEM) modeling {{can be used to}} predict powder compaction response, and can provide insight into the causes of density gradients in green powder compacts; however, accurate numerical simulations require accurate material properties and realistic constitutive laws. To support an effort to implement an advanced cap plasticity model within the finite element framework to realistically simulate powder compaction, the authors have undertaken a project to directly measure as many of the requisite powder properties for modeling as possible. A soil mechanics approach has been refined and used to measure the pressure dependent properties of ceramic powders up to 68. 9 MPa (10, 000 psi). Due to the large strains associated with <b>compacting</b> low <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> ceramic powders, a two-stage process was developed to accurately determine the pressure-density relationship of a ceramic powder in hydrostatic compression, and the properties of that same powder compact under deviatoric loading at the same specific pressures. Using this approach, the seven parameters that are required for application of a modified Drucker-Prager cap plasticity model were determined directly. The details of the experimental techniques used to obtain the modeling parameters and the results for two different granulated alumina powders are presented...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S. Biological Sciences (Ecology, Evolution and Conservation)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2015. Many {{species of}} oak {{across the world}} exhibit low rates of {{recruitment}} and regeneration. In California, Quercus douglasii (blue oak) has experienced little to no recruitment over the past 100 to 150 years. A variety of factors, including competition from non-native plants, livestock grazing, fire suppression, and habitat fragmentation, have individually and collectively been postulated as drivers for low recruitment of blue oak. Despite the prevalence of livestock grazing and attendant soil compaction throughout the range of blue oak, soil compaction has not been studied as a possible factor affecting blue oak recruitment. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study is to examine whether soil compaction affects blue oak seedling emergence and growth. I hypothesized that increasing soil compaction would increase the number of days to emergence and decrease the growth of blue oak seedlings compared to emergence and growth in uncompacted soil. To test this hypothesis blue oak acorns were grown in field collected soil hand <b>compacted</b> to different <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> levels. 	Blue oak acorns and soil were collected at the Sierra Foothill Research and Extension Center (SFREC) located in Yuba County, California. Two pre-germinated acorns were planted in 72 PVC pots filled with soil compacted to contrasting levels of <b>bulk</b> <b>density.</b> <b>Bulk</b> <b>density</b> levels mimicked the range of those found at the SFREC in grazed and ungrazed areas. After germination time to shoot emergence was collected and pots thinned to one seedling each. Seedlings were grown at a nursery in Sacramento for 7 months, after which they were removed from the PVC pots and separated from the soil. Following seedling harvest soils were analyzed for final <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> and basal stem diameter, shoot length, and taproot length of seedlings were measured. Seedling fine and coarse root lengths were measured using WinRHIZO software. Biomass of above and belowground parts of each plant was determined. To test the effect of soil <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> on seedling growth analysis of variance was conducted. 	Time to shoot emergence differed significantly across treatment levels, with seedlings grown at the control <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> level emerging earlier compared to those grown at low and high <b>bulk</b> <b>densities.</b> In addition, taproot length was significantly greater at low and high soil <b>bulk</b> <b>densities</b> compared to the control. Root to shoot mass ratio was significantly higher in low compared to high soil <b>bulk</b> <b>density,</b> but neither differed from the control. No significant differences in seedling growth were observed in the nine other seedling growth variables with respect to compaction treatment. 	The results indicate that soil <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> levels used in this study affected some seedling growth variables but did not substantially inhibit growth of blue oak seedlings. This suggests that soil compaction caused by grazing cattle at moderate stocking rates may affect blue oak seedling emergence but may not affect later stages of seedling growth and thus recruitment in blue oak populations.

No presente trabalho, estudaram-se os efeitos da compactação sub{{superficial}} na morfologia radicular da soja (Glycine max L.

O 'Primavera' foi cultivado até os 37 dias da emergência, em vasos onde a camada de 15 - 18, 5 cm de profundidade foi campactada a 1, 03, 1, 25, 1, 48 e 1, 72 g/cm³, em um latossolo vermelho-escuro com 80 % de areia e 16 % de argila e cuja compactação em subsuperfície levou a um acúmulo de raízes na camada superficial do vaso, sem grandes conseqüências na nutrição da planta. Na densidade aparente de 1, 72 g/cm 3, as raízes não conseguiram penetrar, embora já houvesse alguma restrição ao crescimento na densidade de 1, 25 g/cm³. Quando a camada compactada apresentava resistência à penetração de 0, 69 MPa, houve uma redução de 50 % no crescimento radicular da soja. Soil tillage can originate compacted layers in {{the soil}} subsurface. This compaction reduces root growth, plant development and eventually soybean yields. This study {{examined the effects of}} subsurface compaction on soybean root growth and morphology as related to plant growth and mineral nutrition. Soybean plants cv. Primavera were grown up to 37 days from seedling emergence in pots where a compacted layer was set at the 15. 0 to 18. 5 cm depth. This layer was <b>compacted</b> to <b>bulk</b> <b>densities</b> of 1. 03, 1. 25, 1. 48 and 1. 72 g/cm³, corresponding to cone penetrometer resistances of 0. 05, 3. 0, 7. 5 and 2. 0 MPa, respectively. The soil was a Dark Red Latosol (Haplortox), sandy loam, with 80 % of sand and 16 % of clay. Soil subsurface compaction led to a higher concentration of roots in the surface layer of the pots, without significant effects on plant canopy growth and nutrition. In the presence of a compacted layer the roots were shorter, but nutrient absorption/cm of root was higher. There was some restriction to root growth in the <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> of 1. 25 g/cm³, but there was necessary a <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> of 1. 72 g/cm³ to inhibit completely the root growth.

40|$|Soils release more carbon {{per annum}} than current global {{anthropogenic}} emissions (Luo and Zhou, 2006). Soils emit carbon dioxide through mineralization and decomposition {{of organic matter}} and respiration of roots and soil organism (Houghton 2007) Evaluation {{of the effects of}} abiotic factors on microbial activity is of major importance in the context of mitigation greenhouse gases emissions. One of the key greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide (CO 2) and previous studies demonstrate that soil CO 2 emission is significantly affected by temperature and soil water content. There are a limited number of studies that examine the impact of <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> and soil surface characteristics as a result of exposure to rain on CO 2 emission, however, none examine their relative importance. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of soil compaction and exposure of the soil surface to rainfall and their interaction on CO 2 release. We conducted a factorial soil core experiment with three different <b>bulk</b> <b>densities</b> (1. 1 g cm- 3, 1. 3 g cm- 3, 1. 5 g cm- 3) and three difference exposures to rainfall (no rain, 30 minutes and 90 minutes of rainfall). Water was poured on to the cores not exposed to rain and those exposed for 30 minutes through a gauze to ensure all cores received the same volume of water. Immediately the rainfall treatments the soil cores were incubated and soil CO 2 efflux and water content were measured 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, and 10 days after the start of the incubation. The results indicate soil CO 2 emissions and rate changes significantly through time and with different <b>bulk</b> <b>densities</b> and rain exposures. The relationship between rain exposure and CO 2 ¬ is positive: CO 2 emission was 53 % and 42 % greater for the 90 min and 30 min rainfall exposure, respectively, compared to those not exposed to rain. <b>Bulk</b> <b>density</b> exhibited a negative relationship with CO 2 emission: soil <b>compacted</b> to a <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> of 1. 1 g cm- 3 emitted 32 % more CO 2 than soil compacted to 1. 5 g cm- 3. Furthermore we found that the magnitude of CO 2 effluxes depended on the interaction of these two abiotic factors. Given these results, understanding the influence of soil compaction and raindrop impact on CO 2 emission could lead to modified soil management practices which promote carbon sequestration...|$|R

The potential for surface diffusion of Sr 2 § Ca 2 + and Na + on three clays <b>compacted</b> to dry <b>bulk</b> <b>densities</b> of 1. 25 and 1. 60 Mg/m 3 was examined. The clays were a bentonite, an illite/smectite, and a glacial lake clay (composed mainly of smectite, illite, kaolinite and quartz). The clays were saturated with a Na-Ca-Cl-dominated synthetic groundwater solution with an effective ionic strength of 220 mol/m 3. Total intrinsic diffusion coefficients for the cations were determined from their steady-state flux through compacted clays, and apparent diffusion coefficients {{were obtained from the}} time-lag technique. Models of diffusive transport in com-pacted clays, based only on diffusion in the pore solution, adequately described the diffusion data for all clays and diffusants, and {{there was no need to}} invoke other transport mechanisms, like surface diffusion.

The experimental work includes four stages. The first stage is to develop reliable experimental techniques. The results confirm that ASTM cubic foot test is reliable for measurement of <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> and angle of repose if properly operated, although the latter is better measured in a piling process. Stages 2 and 3 are to investigate the effects of size distribution by using - 3. 55 mm% for stage 2 and mean size do. s for stage 3, water content and oil addition on <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> and angle of repose of coal. For each of them, empirical equations are formulated to predict <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> and angle of repose. The results indicate that the fraction - 3. 55 mm cutting size in stage 2 does not affect <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> significantly, while the increase of do. s decreases <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> to a minimum and then increases. Particle size distribution does not affect angle of repose much. The increase of moisture content decreases <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> and increases angle of repose significantly. The increase of oil addition increases <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> while decreases angle of repose significantly. The correlation between <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> and angle of repose can also be observed: the higher <b>bulk</b> <b>density,</b> the lower angle of repose. There are other variables affecting <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> and angle of repose. They include oil type, absorption time discharging height and external loading.
