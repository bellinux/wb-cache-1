40|$|Introduction In {{this chapter}} {{we are not}} {{concerned}} with the physics of <b>constitutive</b> <b>equations.</b> Our concern will be the macroscopic flow of liquids whose behaviour is governed by these equations. The special class of <b>constitutive</b> <b>equations</b> for the stress considered here is the class of integral <b>constitutive</b> <b>equations.</b> The flow will be taken to be incompressible and isothermal. In the analysis of a viscoelastic fluid flowing through a complex domain one usually has to resort to a numerical simulation of the problem. The deformation fields approach is a method to incorporate integral <b>constitutive</b> <b>equations</b> into macroscopic flow simulations. In most numerical studies the constitutive model is of a di#erential type, in which the stress tensor evolves via a di#erential equation. In these kind of equations the rateof -deformation tensor is used as an input. Di#erential <b>constitutive</b> <b>equations</b> have the numerical advantage that {{the evolution of the}} stress at a certain instance in time...|$|R
