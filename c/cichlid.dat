5|$|The convict <b>cichlid</b> (Amatitlania nigrofasciata) is a {{fish species}} {{from the family}} Cichlidae, native to Central America, {{also known as the}} zebra <b>cichlid.</b> Convict {{cichlids}} are popular aquarium fish and have also been the subject of numerous studies on fish behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The oscar (Astronotus ocellatus) is {{a species}} of fish from the <b>cichlid</b> family known {{under a variety of}} common names, {{including}} tiger oscar, velvet <b>cichlid,</b> and marble <b>cichlid.</b> In tropical South America, where the species naturally resides, A. ocellatus specimens are often found for sale as a food fish in the local markets. The fish has been introduced to other areas, including China, Australia, and the United States. It is considered a popular aquarium fish in Europe and the U.S.|$|E
5|$|The convict <b>cichlid</b> {{displays}} significant color {{across its}} range. Some of these regional variants are now considered different species. In the cichlid-keeping hobby, Rusty Wessel collected one such fish, the Honduran Red Point <b>Cichlid</b> (Amatitlania sp.) from a stream in Honduras. The Honduran Red Point Convict ranges from Atlantic Honduras south to Costa Rica. Other new species formerly included in A. nigrofasciata are Amatitlania coatepeque, from Lake Coatepeque in El Salvador, and Amatitlania kanna, from Panama's Atlantic coast.|$|E

50|$|P. polleni {{ranks among}} the more {{aggressive}} African <b>cichlids,</b> comparable to Malawi and Tilapia <b>cichlids.</b> Some individuals {{have been known to}} kill their tank mates upon reaching maturity. Though P. polleni generally tolerates tankmates too large to eat fairly well. Successful aquarium spawnings are common. There have been reports of P. Polleni living with other <b>cichlids</b> as they are not that aggressive however they are best with other fish and <b>cichlids</b> around about the same size given that they are <b>cichlids.</b>|$|R
50|$|Eight aquariums {{ranging in}} {{capacity}} from 6,000 litres to 75,000 litres. These aquariums house argusfish, barbs, perch, scorpion fish, electric eels, pike, giant gourami, carp, labyrintiods, malawi <b>cichlids,</b> mbuna, mouthbreeders, moonfish, piranhas, giant botia, stingrays, South American <b>cichlids,</b> tanganyika <b>cichlids,</b> tiger barbs and neon tetras.|$|R
5|$|Several {{locations}} {{are available for}} fishing. According to Texas Parks and Wildlife, the following fish have {{been caught in the}} stream: largemouth bass, bluegill, channel catfish, Rio Grande <b>cichlid,</b> longnose gar, green sunfish, sunfish hybrid, redbreast sunfish, and redear sunfish.|$|E
5|$|The convict <b>cichlid</b> {{can reach}} sexual {{maturity}} {{as young as}} 16 weeks, though sexual maturity more commonly occurs at 6 months. Sexually mature convicts form monogamous pairs and spawn in small caves or crevices. In the wild, the fish excavate caves by moving earth from underneath large stones. Females adhere eggs to {{the walls of the}} cave.|$|E
5|$|Introduction of {{non-native}} {{species has}} occurred in many habitats. One of the best studied examples is the introduction of Nile perch into Lake Victoria in the 1960s. Nile perch gradually exterminated the lake's 500 endemic <b>cichlid</b> species. Some of them survive now in captive breeding programmes, but others are probably extinct. Carp, snakeheads, tilapia, European perch, brown trout, rainbow trout, and sea lampreys are other examples of fish that have caused problems by being introduced into alien environments.|$|E
50|$|Bathybates is a genus of piscivorous <b>cichlids</b> {{endemic to}} Lake Tanganyika in East Africa. The genus {{includes}} both pelagic species that mainly feed on Tanganyika sardines and benthic species that mainly feed on other <b>cichlids.</b> They {{are some of}} the deepest-living <b>cichlids,</b> regularly occurring down to 200 m.|$|R
50|$|Cyprichromis is a genus of <b>cichlids</b> {{with five}} species. They are {{also known as}} the herring <b>cichlids</b> or sardine <b>cichlids</b> since they form large schools in the open water of Lake Tanganyika. Of the known species, only C. microlepidotus has been {{recorded}} outside Lake Tanganyika (in eastern Tanzania).|$|R
5000|$|All {{members of}} the genus are monogamous, open {{spawning}} <b>cichlids.</b> Most species are popular in the fishkeeping hobby and are frequently kept in aquariums. Laetacara species are relatively small <b>cichlids,</b> growing from 5-10 centimetres (2-4 in) in length and {{are part of the}} group known to aquarists as dwarf <b>cichlids.</b>|$|R
5|$|In some {{parenting}} species, young from {{a previous}} spawning batch may stay with their parents and help care for the new young. This is known to occur in around 19 species of cichlids in Lake Tanganyika. These helpers take part in cleaning and fanning eggs and larvae, cleaning the breeding hole and protecting the territory. They have reduced growth rate but gain protection from predators. Brood parasitism also exists among teleosts; minnows may spawn in sunfish nests as well as nests of other minnow species. The cuckoo catfish is known for laying eggs on the substrate as mouthbrooding cichclids collect theirs and the young catfish will eat the <b>cichlid</b> larvae. Filial cannibalism occurs in some teleost families and may have evolved to combat starvation.|$|E
25|$|In <b>cichlid</b> taxonomy, {{dentition}} {{was formerly}} {{used as a}} classifying characteristic. However, this was {{complicated by the fact}} that in many cichlids, tooth shape changes with age, due to wear, and cannot be relied upon. Genome sequencing and other technologies transformed <b>cichlid</b> taxonomy.|$|E

50|$|Corematodus {{is a small}} genus of <b>cichlids</b> {{native to}} the Lake Malawi basin in Africa. They feed on scales and fins of other <b>cichlids.</b>|$|R
5|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{environmental}} parameters like changes in temperature and prior residence may affect the <b>cichlid's</b> territorial aggression. The convict <b>cichlids</b> are more aggressive at 30°C as opposed to 26°C, which may be {{explained by the fact that}} convict <b>cichlids</b> tend to set up their breeding sites and spawn at 30°C.|$|R
50|$|Melanochromis is a genus of haplochromine <b>cichlids</b> {{endemic to}} Lake Malawi in Eastern Africa. Ecologically, {{they belong to}} the rock-dwelling mbuna <b>cichlids</b> of Lake Malawi.|$|R
25|$|Numerous <b>cichlid</b> {{species have}} been {{selectively}} bred to develop ornamental aquarium strains. The most intensive programs have involved angelfish and discus, and many mutations that affect both coloration and fins are known. Other cichlids have been bred for albino, leucistic, and xanthistic pigment mutations, including oscars, convict <b>cichlid</b> and Pelvicachromis pulcher. Both dominant and recessive pigment mutations have been observed. In convict cichlids, for example, a leucistic coloration is recessively inherited, while in Oreochromis niloticus niloticus, red coloration {{is caused by a}} dominant inherited mutation.|$|E
25|$|On January 11, 2008, the Cagayan Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) {{stated that}} tilapia (species of <b>cichlid</b> fishes from the tilapiine <b>cichlid</b> tribe) {{production}} grew and Cagayan Valley {{is now the}} Philippines’ tilapia capital (Saint Peter's fish). Production supply grew 37.25% since 2003, with 14,000 metric tons (MT) in 2007. The recent aquaculture congress found that the growth of tilapia production was due to government interventions: provision of fast-growing species, accreditation of private hatcheries to ensure supply of quality fingerlings, establishment of demonstration farms, providing free fingerlings to newly constructed fishponds, and the dissemination of tilapia to Nueva Vizcaya (in Diadi town).|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{introduced}} Nile perch (Lates niloticus), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), {{and water}} hyacinth, deforestation {{that led to}} water siltation, and overfishing, many Lake Victoria <b>cichlid</b> species have become extinct or been drastically reduced. By around 1980, lake fisheries yielded only 1% cichlids, a drastic decline from 80% in earlier years.|$|E
50|$|At up {{to about}} 20 cm in {{standard}} length, {{it is the largest}} <b>cichlids</b> in Lake Ejagham. It feeds on small fish, especially juvenile <b>cichlids.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{environmental}} parameters like changes in temperature and prior residence may affect the <b>cichlid's</b> territorial aggression. The convict <b>cichlids</b> are more aggressive at 30 °C as opposed to 26 °C, which may be {{explained by the fact that}} convict <b>cichlids</b> tend to set up their breeding sites and spawn at 30 °C.|$|R
50|$|Parachromis is a genus of <b>cichlids</b> {{native to}} Central America. Some species occur in Lake Nicaragua and Lake Managua. All species are predatory and {{relatively}} large for <b>cichlids.</b>|$|R
25|$|Cichlids mate either monogamously or polygamously. The {{mating system}} {{of a given}} <b>cichlid</b> species is not {{consistently}} associated with its brooding system. For example, although most monogamous cichlids are not mouthbrooders, Chromidotilapia, Gymnogeophagus, Spathodus and Tanganicodus all include - or consist entirely of - monogamous mouthbrooders. In contrast, numerous open- or cave-spawning cichlids are polygamous; examples include many Apistogramma, Lamprologus, Nannacara, and Pelvicachromis species.|$|E
25|$|Adaptation {{is one of}} the {{two main}} {{processes}} that explain the observed diversity of species, such as the different species of Darwin's finches. The other process is speciation, in which new species arise, typically through reproductive isolation. A favorite example used today to study the interplay of adaptation and speciation is the evolution of <b>cichlid</b> fish in African lakes, where the question of reproductive isolation is complex.|$|E
25|$|Kullander (1998) recognizes eight subfamilies of cichlids: the Astronotinae, Cichlasomatinae, Cichlinae, Etroplinae, Geophaginae, Heterochromidinae, Pseudocrenilabrinae, and Retroculinae. A ninth subfamily, Ptychochrominae, {{was later}} {{recognized}} by Sparks and Smith. <b>Cichlid</b> taxonomy is still debated, and classification of genera cannot yet be definitively given. A comprehensive system of assigning species to monophyletic genera is still lacking, {{and there is}} not complete agreement on what genera should be recognized in this family.|$|E
50|$|Like all <b>cichlids</b> from Lake Malawi these <b>cichlids</b> {{are best}} {{maintained}} in hard, alkaline water. Iodotropheus are best kept in aquariums with volumes greater than 120 l (31.5 gallon).|$|R
50|$|Like {{many other}} <b>cichlids</b> from Lake Malawi, auratus <b>cichlids</b> are mouthbrooders. Females hold their fertilized eggs and fry in their mouth {{for a few}} weeks before {{releasing}} the fry.|$|R
50|$|Mazarunia is a genus of <b>cichlids</b> {{from the}} Mazaruni River, a {{tributary}} of the Essequibo River in Guyana. They are dwarf <b>cichlids</b> that do not surpass 8.5 cm in length.|$|R
25|$|Many large {{cichlids}} {{are popular}} game fish. The peacock bass (Cichla species) of South America {{is one of}} the most popular sportfish. It was introduced in many waters around the world. In Florida, this fish generates millions of hours of fishing and sportfishing revenue of more than US$8 million a year. Other cichlids preferred by anglers include the oscar, Mayan <b>cichlid</b> (Cichlasoma urophthalmus), and jaguar guapote (Parachromis managuensis).|$|E
25|$|Some {{cichlids}} readily hybridize with related species, both in {{the wild}} and under artificial conditions. Other groups of fishes, such as European cyprinids, also hybridize. Unusually, <b>cichlid</b> hybrids have been put to extensive commercial use, in particular for aquaculture and aquaria. The hybrid red strain of tilapia, for example, is often preferred in aquaculture for its rapid growth. Tilapia hybridization can produce all-male populations to control stock density or prevent reproduction in ponds.|$|E
25|$|Death feigning {{may also}} play a role in reproduction, For example, in the nursery web spider, the male {{sometimes}} feigns death to avoid getting eaten by females during mating. In some cases, death feigning is used by a predator. For example, the predatory <b>cichlid</b> Haplochromis livingstoni lies on its side on the bottom sediments until approached by scavengers attracted to {{what appears to be a}} dead fish, whereupon H. livingstoni abandons the pretence, rights itself and attacks the scavenger.|$|E
50|$|Around 24 {{species of}} lamprologine <b>cichlids</b> use {{abandoned}} shells for shelter and breeding in Lake Tanganyika. Most, however, are not obligate shell-breeding <b>cichlids</b> and will spawn in other caves or crevices.|$|R
50|$|Crenicichla is a genus of <b>cichlids</b> {{native to}} South America {{commonly}} known as the pike <b>cichlids.</b> They are found in most tropical and subtropical freshwater habitats between the Andes and the Atlantic.|$|R
50|$|Mesonauta, {{the flag}} <b>cichlids,</b> {{is a small}} genus of <b>cichlids</b> native to soft, acidic {{freshwater}} habitats in South America. Mesonauta {{is part of the}} family Cichlidae and is included in subfamily Cichlasomatinae.|$|R
