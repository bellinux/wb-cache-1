5|$|Two {{months after}} the {{withdrawal}} of Bruce's bill, a ministerial by-election in Pontefract in 1872 gave the LNA an opportunity for further action. Although they did not field a candidate, Josephine attended meetings in the town. At one LNA meeting {{the floor of the}} room had been liberally sprinkled with <b>cayenne</b> <b>pepper</b> by her opponents, making speaking difficult. After it was cleared away, her opponents set bales of straw alight in a storeroom below, which led to smoke rising through the floorboards; two members of the Metropolitan Police—specially drafted into the town for the by-election—looked on but took no action. Although the incumbent Liberal candidate, Hugh Childers, was returned, there were heavy abstentions, and his vote was reduced by around 150 (from an electorate of 2,000). In December 1872 Josephine met the Prime Minister, William Gladstone, when he visited Liverpool College. Although he supported the aims of the LNA, he was politically unable to back the LNA publicly, and had supported Bruce's bill.|$|E

500|$|The University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette's [...] "Ragin' Cajuns" [...] are {{sometimes}} cited as counter-arguments {{to those that}} favor change. However, rather than referring to [...] "others" [...] these teams employ symbols that European American cultures have historically used to represent themselves. The University of Notre Dame mascot, the UND leprechaun is a mythical being that represents the Irish, which is both an ethnic and a national group. The University of Louisiana at Lafayette mascot is an anthropomorphic <b>cayenne</b> <b>pepper,</b> an ingredient frequently found in Cajun cuisine. Opponents also see this argument as a false equivalency, because it ignores systemic inequality, and serves to discount the Native American voice by saying that if one group isn't hurt by a particular portrayal, then no group {{has the right to}} be hurt, regardless of vastly different backgrounds, treatment, and social positions.|$|E
500|$|The colony was {{transferred}} from French to Spanish control in 1762. The Spanish government actively recruited settlers for Spanish Louisiana.

The Canary Islanders also brought [...] "a love for well-seasoned food", including use of ground <b>cayenne</b> <b>pepper,</b> a spicy hot red chili pepper. [...] Spanish authorities also granted permission for {{a large number of}} French-speaking Acadian exiles to relocate from northeastern North America to Louisiana. [...] From 1755 through 1795, almost 3,000 of these settlers, soon known as Cajuns, moved to the areas south and west of New Orleans. [...] Louisiana was secretly returned to France in 1800, then purchased by the United States in 1803. [...] The southernmost part of territorial Louisiana, including New Orleans, became the state of Louisiana in 1812.|$|E
500|$|References to angels {{on horseback}} in the United States {{date to the}} mid- to late 1890s. One of the {{earliest}} references in an American newspaper is an 1896 article from the New York Times, where the dish is suggested as an appetizer; according to the Times, the dish is to be credited to Urbain Dubois, the chef of the German emperor. In this version, the angels on horseback are skewered, sprinkled with <b>cayenne</b> <b>pepper,</b> and broiled. The article suggests serving the dish with lemon and parsley, but without toast. In the 1930s, they are suggested {{as part of a}} picnic menu, and in 1948 again as an appetizer. In the 1950s, American newspapers featured the dish with interest, from papers including the Chicago Tribune, with the articles [...] "For Oyster Treat, Try Angels on Horseback: They're Delectable Appetizer Sunday Menu", and [...] "These Angels on Horseback Are Oysters", and the Los Angeles Times.|$|E

5000|$|Capsicum annuum is {{a species}} of the plant genus Capsicum native to {{southern}} North America and northern South America. This species {{is the most common}} and extensively cultivated of the five domesticated capsicums. The species encompasses a wide variety of shapes and sizes of peppers, both mild and hot, such as bell <b>peppers,</b> jalapeños, and <b>cayenne</b> <b>peppers.</b> Cultivars are descended from the wild American bird pepper still found in warmer regions of the Americas. In the past some woody forms of this species have been called C. frutescens, but the features that were used to distinguish those forms appear in many populations of C. annuum and it is not a consistently recognizable feature in C. frutescens species. [...] Moreover, crosses between C.annuum and C. frutescens aren't likely because seeds obtained from polliations between those two species (if the embryo survives) will not germinate.|$|R
