40|$|Aims: To isolate and {{characterize}} Bacillus thuringiensis {{from different}} soil types within Zaria and screen {{them for the}} possession of cry genes. Methodology: Soil samples were collected from different sites in Zaria. A total of twelve Bacillus thuringiensis strains were isolated from the different soil types. This isolates screen for the possession of cry 1, <b>cry</b> 2, <b>cry</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>cry</b> 4 genes using Polymerase Chain Reaction. Results: Eight of the 12 isolates showed the presence {{of at least one}} cry gene, while the remaining four showed none. Cry 1 was the most frequently detected gene (58. 88 %), followed by cry 2 (16. 67 %), while <b>cry</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>cry</b> 4 had the least occurrence (8. 33 %). Isolate L 3 had <b>cry</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>cry</b> 2, L 2 had <b>cry</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>cry</b> 3 while isolate L 1 had <b>cry</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>cry</b> 4.

40|$|Thirteen of {{the most}} common lepidopteran-specific Cry {{proteins}} of Bacillus thuringiensis have been tested for their efficacy against newly hatched larvae of two populations of the spiny bollworm, Earias insulana. At a concentration of 100 μg of toxin per milliliter of artificial diet, six Cry toxins (Cry 1 Ca, Cry 1 Ea, Cry 1 Fa, Cry 1 Ja, <b>Cry</b> 2 Aa, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 2 Ab) were not toxic at all. Cry 1 Aa, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ja, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 2 Aa did not cause mortality but caused significant inhibition of growth. The other Cry toxins (Cry 1 Ab, Cry 1 Ac, Cry 1 Ba, Cry 1 Da, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ia, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca) were toxic to E. insulana larvae. The 50 % lethal concentration values of these toxins ranged from 0. 39 to 21. 13 μg/ml (for <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ia, respectively) for an E. insulana laboratory colony originating from Egypt and from 0. 20 to 4. 25 μg/ml (for <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Da, respectively) for a laboratory colony originating from Spain. The relative potencies of the toxins in the population from Egypt were highest for <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab, <b>and</b> they were both significantly more toxic than <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ba, followed by <b>Cry</b> 1 Da <b>and</b> finally <b>Cry</b> 1 Ia.

40|$|Insecticidal {{activity}} and receptor binding properties of Bacillus thuringiensis toxins to yellow and striped rice stem borers (Sciropophaga incertulas and Chilo suppresalis, respectively) were investigated. Yellow stem borer (YSB) was susceptible to Cry 1 Aa, Cry 1 Ac, <b>Cry</b> 2 A, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 C toxins with similar toxicities. To striped stem borer (SSB), Cry 1 Ac, <b>Cry</b> 2 A, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 C were more toxic than Cry 1 Aa toxin.

But I was so crazy with joy and excitement that I never stopped to think. Gertrude just dropped there among the golden young ferns {{as if she had been}} shot. The fright it gave me ought to make me sensible--in this respect at least--for the rest of my life. I thought I had killed her--I remembered that her mother had died very suddenly from heart failure when quite a young woman. It seemed years to me before I discovered that her heart was still beating. A pretty time I had! I never saw anybody faint before, and I knew there was nobody up at the house to help, because everybody else had gone to the station to meet Di and Nan coming home from Redmond. But I knew--theoretically--how people in a faint should be treated, and now I know it practically. Luckily the brook was handy, and after I had worked frantically over her for a while Gertrude came back to life. She never said one word about my news and I didn't dare to refer to it again. I helped her walk up through the maple grove and up to her room, and then she said, 'Rob--is--living,' as if the words were torn out of her, and flung herself on her bed and <b>cried</b> <b>and</b> <b>cried</b> <b>and</b> <b>cried.</b> I never saw anyone cry so before.

6000|$|The {{intensity}} {{the circumstance}} in question might wear to the informed imagination {{would have been}} sufficiently revealed for us, no doubt--and with other things to our purpose--in {{two or three of}} those confidential passages with Mrs. Lowder that she now permitted herself. She hadn't yet been so glad that she believed in her old friend; for if she hadn't had, at such a pass, somebody or other to believe in she should certainly have stumbled by the way. Discretion had ceased to consist of silence; silence was gross and thick, whereas wisdom should taper, however tremulously, to a point. She betook herself to Lancaster Gate the morning after the colloquy just noted; and there, in Maud Manningham's own sanctum, she gradually found relief in giving an account of herself. An account of herself {{was one of the things}} that she had long been in the habit of expecting herself regularly to give--the regularity depending of course much on such tests of merit as might, by laws beyond her control, rise in her path. She never spared herself in short a proper sharpness of conception of how she had behaved, and it was a statement that she for the most part found herself able to make. What had happened at present was that nothing, as she felt, was left of her to report to; she was all too sunk in the inevitable and the abysmal. To give an account of herself she must give it to somebody else, and her first instalment of it to her hostess was that she must please let her cry. She couldn't cry, with Milly in observation, at the hotel, which she had accordingly left for that purpose; and the power happily came to her with the good opportunity. She <b>cried</b> <b>and</b> <b>cried</b> at first--she confined herself to that; it was for the time the best statement of her business. Mrs. Lowder moreover intelligently took it as such, though knocking off a note or two more, as she said, while Susie sat near her table. She could resist the contagion of tears, but her patience did justice to her visitor's most vivid plea for it. [...] "I shall never be able, you know, to cry again--at least not ever with her; so I must take it out when I can. Even if she does herself it won't be for me to give away; for what would that be but a confession of despair? I'm not with her for that--I'm with her to be regularly sublime. Besides, Milly won't cry herself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{friend the}} count," [...] it was thus {{that he began}} his story, [...] "had for an enemy a certain German baron, a {{stranger}} in Rome. It matters not what was the ground of the count's enmity; but as he had a firm design to be revenged, and that with safety to himself, he kept it secret even from the baron. Indeed, {{that is the first}} principle of vengeance; and hatred betrayed is hatred impotent. The count was a man of a curious, searching mind; he had something of the artist; if anything fell for him to do, it must always be done with an exact perfection, not only as to the result, but in the very means and instruments, or he thought the thing miscarried. It chanced he was one day riding in the outer suburbs, when he came to a disused by-road branching off into the moor which lies about Rome. On the one hand was an ancient Roman tomb; on the other a deserted house in a garden of evergreen trees. This road brought him presently into a field of ruins, in the midst of which, in the side of a hill, he saw an open door, and, not far off, a single stunted pine no greater than a currant-bush. The place was desert and very secret; a voice spoke in the count's bosom that there was something here to his advantage. He tied his horse to the pine-tree, took his flint and steel in his hand to make a light, and entered into the hill. The doorway opened on a passage of old Roman masonry, which shortly after branched in two. The count took the turning to the right, and followed it, groping forward in the dark, till he was brought up by a kind of fence, about elbow-high, which extended quite across the passage. Sounding forward with his foot, he found an edge of polished stone, and then vacancy. All his curiosity was now awakened, and, getting some rotten sticks that lay about the floor, he made a fire. In front of him was a profound well; doubtless some neighbouring peasant had once used it for his water, and it was he that had set up the fence. A long while the count stood leaning on the rail and looking down into the pit. It was of Roman foundation, and, like all that nation set their hands to, built as for eternity; the sides were still straight, and the joints smooth; to a man who should fall in, no escape was possible. 'Now,' the count was thinking, 'a strong impulsion brought me to this place. What for? what have I gained? why should I be sent to gaze into this well?' when the rail of the fence gave suddenly under his weight, and he came within an ace of falling headlong in. Leaping back to save himself, he trod out the last flicker of his fire, which gave him thenceforward no more light, only an incommoding smoke. 'Was I sent here to my death?' says he, and shook from head to foot. And then a thought flashed in his mind. He crept forth on hands and knees to the brink of the pit, and felt above him in the air. The rail had been fast to a pair of uprights; it had only broken from the one, and still depended from the other. The count set it back again as he had found it, so that the place meant death to the first comer, and groped out of the catacomb like a sick man. The next day, riding in the Corso with the baron, he purposely betrayed a strong preoccupation. The other (as he had designed) inquired into the cause; and he, after some fencing, admitted that his spirits had been dashed by an unusual dream. This was calculated to draw on the baron--a superstitious man, who affected the scorn of superstition. Some rallying followed, and then the count, as if suddenly carried away, called on his friend to beware, for it was of him that he had dreamed. You know enough of human nature, my excellent Mackellar, to be certain of one thing: I mean that the baron did not rest till he had heard the dream. The count, sure that he would never desist, kept him in play till his curiosity was highly inflamed, and then suffered himself, with seeming reluctance, to be overborne. 'I warn you,' says he, 'evil will come of it; something tells me so. But since there is to be no peace either for you or me except on this condition, the blame be on your own head! This was the dream:--I beheld you riding, I know not where, yet I think it must have been near Rome, for on your one hand was an ancient tomb, and on the other a garden of evergreen trees. Methought I <b>cried</b> <b>and</b> <b>cried</b> upon you to come back in a very agony of terror; whether you heard me I know not, but you went doggedly on. The road brought you to a desert place among ruins, where was a door in a hill-side, and hard by the door a misbegotten pine. Here you dismounted (I still crying on you to beware), tied your horse to the pine-tree, and entered resolutely in by the door. Within, it was dark; but in my dream I could still see you, and still besought you to hold back. You felt your way along the right-hand wall, took a branching passage to the right, and came to a little chamber, where was a well with a railing. At this--I know not why--my alarm for you increased a thousandfold, so that I seemed to scream myself hoarse with warnings, crying it was still time, and bidding you begone at once from that vestibule. Such was the word I used in my dream, and it seemed then to have a clear significancy; but to-day, and awake, I profess I know not what it means. To all my outcry you rendered not the least attention, leaning the while upon the rail and looking down intently in the water. And then there was made to you a communication; I do not think I even gathered what it was, but the fear of it plucked me clean out of my slumber, and I awoke shaking and sobbing. And now,' continues the count, 'I thank you from my heart for your insistency. This dream lay on me like a load; and now I have told it in plain words and in the broad daylight, it seems no great matter.'--'I do not know,' says the baron. 'It is in some points strange. A communication, did you say! O! it is an odd dream. It will make a story to amuse our friends.'--'I am not so sure,' says the count. 'I am sensible of some reluctancy. Let us rather forget it.'--'By all means,' says the baron. And (in fact) the dream was not again referred to. Some days after, the count proposed a ride in the fields, which the baron (since they were daily growing faster friends) very readily accepted. On the way back to Rome, the count led them insensibly by a particular route. Presently he reined in his horse, clapped his hand before his eyes, and cried out aloud. Then he showed his face again (which was now quite white, for he was a consummate actor), and stared upon the baron. 'What ails you?' cries the baron. 'What is wrong with you?'--'Nothing,' cries the count. 'It is nothing. A seizure, I know not what. Let us hurry back to Rome.' But in the meanwhile the baron had looked about him; and there, on the left-hand side of the way as they went back to Rome, he saw a dusty by-road with a tomb upon the one hand and a garden of evergreen trees upon the other.--'Yes,' says he, with a changed voice. 'Let us by all means hurry back to Rome. I fear you are not well in health.'--'O, for God's sake!' cried the count, shuddering, 'back to Rome and let me get to bed.' They made their return with scarce a word; and the count, who should by rights have gone into society, took to his bed and gave out he had a touch of country fever. The next day the baron's horse was found tied to the pine, but himself was never heard of from that hour.--And now, was that a murder?" [...] says the Master, breaking sharply off.|$|E
40|$|Mammalian Cryptochromes, <b>CRY</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> 2, {{function}} as principal regulators of a transcription-translation-based {{negative feedback loop}} underlying the mammalian circadian clockwork. An F-box protein, FBXL 3, promotes ubiquitination <b>and</b> degradation of <b>CRYs,</b> while FBXL 21, the closest paralog of FBXL 3, ubiquitinates CRYs but leads to stabilization of CRYs. Fbxl 3 knockout extremely lengthened the circadian period, and deletion of Fbxl 21 gene in Fbxl 3 -deficient mice partially rescued the period-lengthening phenotype, suggesting a key role of CRY protein stability for maintenance of the circadian periodicity. Here, we employed a proteomics strategy to explore regulators for the protein stability of CRYs. We found that ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP 7 also known as HAUSP) associates with <b>CRY</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> 2 <b>and</b> stabilizes <b>CRYs</b> through deubiquitination. Treatment with USP 7 -specific inhibitor or Usp 7 knockdown shortened the circadian period of the cellular rhythm. We identified another CRYs-interacting protein, TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP- 43), an RNA-binding protein. TDP- 43 stabilized <b>CRY</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> 2, <b>and</b> its knockdown also shortened the circadian period in cultured cells. The present study identified USP 7 and TDP- 43 as the regulators of <b>CRY</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> 2, underscoring {{the significance of the}} stability control process of CRY proteins for period determination in the mammalian circadian clockwork...|$|R

On S. frugiperda, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac compete for the same binding site; <b>Cry</b> 1 Ba <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ca compete for a second binding site. Cry 1 Ea recognizes a third specific binding site in S. frugiperda and does not compete with any of the other toxins. On D. grandiosella <b>and</b> D. saccharalis, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac competes with <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab <b>and</b> not with <b>Cry</b> 1 Ba <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ca. <b>Cry</b> 1 Ba <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ca recognize each a specific binding site and do not compete with any of the other four toxins.
