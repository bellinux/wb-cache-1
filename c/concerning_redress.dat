40|$|Although {{university}} traditions can be fun, {{they are}} ‘not just for fun’. Moving beyond the visual quaint imagery of university traditions, this study explores {{the workings of}} institutional traditions during the everyday consumption of pedagogic innovation. The study employs a Reader-Response Theory, a prominent school of literary criticism, of two textbook innovations within a university establishment which had a distinct tradition to research {{beginning in the early}} 1960 s. The findings suggest that the temporary institutional breakdown provides a powerful medium to understand the work of university traditions in the consumption of innovative textbooks. We show that in the consumption of pedagogic innovation, the recipients are not passive but are co-constructors of university tradition defence, via the articulation of values, boundary containment and identity work. We identify, moreover, four types of readings of the pedagogic innovation – interpretative, instrumental, inversive and reflexive. The findings also reveal three distinct forms of tradition vocabularies employed in the university administration of pedagogic innovation – breach <b>concerns,</b> <b>redress</b> articulation and reintegration epistemology. Overall, the findings contribute to a more sophisticated understanding of the ‘past in the present’ in the workings of university traditions in the everyday consumption of pedagogic innovation...|$|R

Snakes are unpopular animals; they suffer from human harassment in most places and many populations have declined worldwide. Consequently, they provide suitable substrate to better improve conservation education in schoolchildren. Responses to a questionnaire administered to 2, 570 schoolchildren (7 - 14 years old) from 10 countries showed that many children liked snakes and {{that most of the}} students wanted to see snakes protected. Such counterintuitive results were supported by the explanations given by the children, notably the reasons they liked or disliked snakes. Previous physical contact with snakes was often associated with snake likeability. We also found strong and expected differences between countries: for instance, where venomous snakes represented a health risk, most children declared to be afraid of snakes. Overall, our results negate the simplistic, and previously unverified, adult view that snakes are necessarily perceived as frightening animals, thereby justifying their persecution. This study provides an encouraging message, suggesting that it is not compulsory to focus on charismatic animals to convince children to protect wildlife...|$|R

Considering the geographical proximity and political ties between Hong Kong and Mainland China, the share of inbound tourists to Hong Kong has been, and will continuously be, largely occupied by Mainland Chinese tourists on an uprising basis. The phenomenon of the Chinese tourists' wave, operationalizing as the influx of tourists from Mainland China, has brought tremendous change on Hong Kong's tourism industry, economy and local community. It is, thus, of necessity to understand the perceptions and response toward this phenomenon from local residents' perspective as they are the stakeholders of local tourism. Drawing on the findings from three focus group interviews with 18 Hong Kong residents, three conventional dimensions, namely Economic, Social-cultural and Environmental were identified and discussed to demonstrate the local residents' perceptions toward the impact of Chinese tourists' wave phenomenon.

40|$|South African {{universities}} {{are under pressure}} to alter their institutional cultures and policies {{in order to provide}} compensation for the neglect of black academic staff and students during our apartheid past. This redress is interpreted by pressure groups and policymakers to entail giving priority to rectification goals within existing universities. What is ignored is {{the question of whether the}} first-order functions of every South African university - which are research and teaching will be compromised. Elevating a second-order function like redress above what have historically been the defining features of a university for more than a thousand years, has probable destructive consequences overlooked by academic and administrative insiders and policymakers. But when viewed historically, educational compensation is a recent phenomenon, arising within the last century. Because of the large scale involved in the South African case, these pressures on local {{universities are}} an extreme version of what is locally called a <b>concern</b> with <b>redress</b> or social justice.

40|$|Health and {{education}} are two {{important aspects of}} human capital and {{form the basis of}} an individual’s economic productivity in any country. In South Africa, hunger and malnutrition continue to hamper the health, quality of life and survival of school going children such that some children drop- out of school due to these socio-economic problems (Tomlinson, 2007 : 2). The introduction of previous School Feeding Schemes to address the question of hunger and poverty within schools was mostly left in the 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s to charitable and Non-Governmental Organizations such as Operation Hunger and ITHUBA (Swartz, 2009 : 38). According to Perlman (1993 : 14) South Africa’s track record of child deaths was more than double that of any other country of similar income levels worldwide, due to the apartheid government deserting its responsibility of feeding the nation. The White Paper for the Transformation of Health System (1997 : 125) had also stated that improving nutrition within the rural schools is an imperative and a sound economic investment which is politically rewarding. Nelson Mandela (1996 : 8) once said “Our children are our nation’s future. Prospects for development are seriously undermined by the kind of large scale deprivation of children that South Africa has experienced. On the other hand investing in their health, nutrition {{and education}} not only improves our children’s quality of life – the gains reverberate into the future generations. ” From April 1994, through the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) the Government of National Unity under the leadership of Dr. Nelson Mandela identified the area of school feeding as a policy prime <b>concern</b> in <b>redressing</b> the imbalances and inequities of the past governments.

40|$|Study for the European Parliament, Sub-Committee on Human Rights, EXPO/B/DROI/ 2013 / 20 The Lisbon Treaty has rung {{in a new}} era of {{democratic}} and human rights governance. In an attempt to <b>redress</b> <b>concerns</b> about the EU’s alleged democratic deficit and inability to speak with one voice on cross-cutting issues of human rights, both the empowered European Parliament (EP) and national parliaments (NPs) are meant to ‘contribute actively to the good functioning of the Union’ through inter-parliamentary cooperation (IPC). At the same time, the EU’s action is also poised to systematically ‘put human rights at the heart of all its policies’. Given the role of parliaments as ‘guardians and promoters of human rights’ at a time when their ability to influence the EU legislative process has significantly been enhanced, the question arises whether the EU’s ‘human rights turn’ may act as a catalyst for IPC, and whether this collaboration may, in turn, strengthen the effectiveness and legitimacy of EU human rights policies. To that end, this study maps the increasingly complex network of formal and informal IPC channels in the realm of human rights, assesses their respective strengths and weaknesses, and formulates recommendations to enhance IPC in this regard. nrpages: 58 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Nearly {{forty years}} ago when I was a {{graduate}} student (at the Divinity School of the University of Chicago) trying to envision how the theoretical tools, the findings, and the methods of the cognitive sciences might be brought to bear on religious phenomena, the universal response that such speculations elicited was some variation or other on the comment “Oh!

Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, it took leaving the field of religious studies for me to find more hospitable intellectual environs in which to pursue and develop those ideas. I have spent most of my subsequent career among philosophers and practitioners of the psychological, cognitive, and neuro-sciences. In the 1990 s after Tom Lawson and I (both jointly and individually) had begun to publish our ideas about carrying out a cognitive science of religion, I began, once again, to travel in the world of religious studies.

40|$|The {{technological}} developments {{that led to}} mass production and globalisation also changed the law. As {{it is not uncommon}} for individuals to be harmed in identical or similar ways by mass-produced products and standardised corporate practices, mechanisms are needed to cope with these new situations. This has been reflected by the introduction of product liability laws around the world. In addition to substantive law being adjusted to these developments, entire legal systems must also be changed. Collective redress is the procedural counterpart that mirrors these changes in substantive law. Current procedural provisions were created in the light of two-party litigation and cannot cope with multi-party situations. Therefore, a mechanism of collective redress is being introduced globally. On 11 June 2013, the European Commission published a series of common, non-binding principles for collective redress mechanisms in European Union member states in the form of a Recommendation. Member states were invited to implement the principles set out in the Recommendation by 26 July 2015. Currently, the relatively new European mechanisms vary significantly, and although the broad rules of the Recommendation are unlikely to change this situation, the Recommendation aims to create a coherent approach in terms of collective redress. A comparison of the different regimes will uncover weaknesses and help to evaluate and improve the Recommendation. As the European Commission rejects ‘United States (US) style’ class actions for entrepreneurial litigation caused by contingency fees, punitive damages and the American rule of costs, Australia provides with their unavailability a great object of comparison. Having conducted class actions for almost 25 years, Australia can be regarded as one of the most developed countries—alongside the US and Canada—in relation to collective redress. A comparison of the existing mechanisms in Europe and Australia will provide an overview of how the major difficulties of class actions are handled, such as the rational apathy of claimants, free riders and the avoidance of unmeritorious claims. After introducing the topic in the first section of the thesis, the second section will analyse the existing mechanisms on the basis of national reports. The legal developments <b>concerning</b> collective <b>redress</b> will be analysed, and a summary of the current developments will be provided. Drawing upon the outcome of the second section, the third section will compare the similarities and differences between the various legal systems, and it will evaluate the different approaches by focusing on the major difficulties. The thesis will conclude with a recommendation based on the evaluation of the different approaches. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney.

40|$|This thesis {{reports a}} study which {{examines}} {{the influences of}} the availability of redress procedures on the decisions of consumers to purchase online. Availability of redress procedures in this concept is when consumers have access to uncomplicated complaint procedures that offer timely resolution and effective compensation and handling. Previous research has shown that many factors such as product price, availability, merchant reputation and integrity, consumer attitude, perceived convenience, enjoyment and pleasure, and service quality influence the decisions of consumers to purchase on line. This study focuses on the availability of redress procedures on the decisions of consumers to purchase online and the importance role of redress in that process. Data was collected initially in face-to-face interviews with both consumers, who buy online, and merchants who sell online. Then Focus Group discussions with consumers were conducted to further understand and confirmed the findings emerged from the interview process. The research shows that price was always the first and most significant influence in consumers’ decisions to purchase online. Likewise, consumers also make decisions about online purchasing because of product availability and the range of product choices available to them. Consumers are also sensitive to shipping fees when deciding to purchase online. It also shows that any delay or longer delivery time also influences consumers’ decisions in switching back to offline purchasing. Lastly, consumers choose to purchase online because they enjoy the fun and excitement during the process of online purchasing. A model showing the influence of these factors was created, adding the effects {{of the availability of}} redress on those decisions. This research shows that the availability of redress does not always influence consumers in making decisions to purchase online. If most transactions are fulfilled according to the consumer’s expectations, then consumers have little, if any, <b>concern</b> with <b>redress.</b> Sometimes factors such as merchant reputation, low risk transactions, guaranteed purchase fulfilment, product price and availability, enjoyable online purchasing experience, shipping cost and delivery time seem to be a more important influence on consumers in their decisions to purchase online.  This research concludes that the availability of redress can and does indirectly influence consumer confidence and trust ix in online purchasing and therefore impacts on their decision to purchase, if and only if, one of these three circumstances happens: 1. When problems occur in online purchasing process and subsequently consumers require an immediate access to a complaint handling system; 2. When risk is perceived to be present in the purchasing process then the availability of redress policy and/or procedures is required by consumers to guarantee that they are well protected from financial loss; and 3. When redress initiatives are offered that allow consumers to assess the merchant’s accountability in offering satisfactory online purchasing fulfilment...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} <b>concerned</b> with <b>redressing</b> {{the paucity of}} {{representations}} of ambivalence, abjection and melancholia within the dyadic relationship of mother and daughter. It challenges the tradition of representing maternity as an innate and all-encompassing pleasure and seeks to represent the so far inadequately explored, 'underbelly' of maternal experience {{through the medium of}} sculpture. Sculptural representations of the mother-daughter dyad that stray from cultural niceties and norms are essentially terra incognita. Although this topic has been addressed to an extent within performance and literature; there is a glaring lack of visual art, and in particular sculptural work, that directly addresses this complex area within such a fundamental human arena of relationship. Within contemporary western culture, the dynamics of the mother and daughter relationship is a difficult subject concealed beneath a saccharine facade of idealised thinking It gets more contentious still, as the journey into a particularly uncharted area of the dyad is taken - the journey into the 'forbidden zone' of maternal ambivalence and abjection. Recent psychological research {{has made it clear that}} the incidence of ambivalence within the mother and daughter dyad is much higher than is popularly imagined. Yet it is a subject which has virtually escaped visual representation within Western art. Historically in Western society male artists and authors have been overwhelmingly responsible for the presentation of images of motherhood and this has generally followed the format of adoring mother/Madonna with son. This is a patriarchal tradition; a tradition of Christianity - a tradition redolent of systems of social control. Where are the representations of the mother and daughter relationship within our culture that could go some way toward reflecting with integrity and without guile, the wide-ranging actualities of maternity? Where are the representations of maternal ambivalence, of mothers' despair, of the body's abjection? The research within this project is informed by an understanding of relevant writings of Julia Kristeva, and as such is permeated by the 'darkness' that resides within this French philosopher's work. To a lesser extent, the writings of Kristeva's contemporary, Irigaray informs the thesis, as do specific threads of thought within Klein's early psychoanalytic theories (particularly issues around ambivalence and the uncanny.). The research also draws on autobiographical experiences and articulates a body of visual predecessors and sculptural influences upon Vena Casa — in particular the works of Louise Bourgeois, but also those of Mary Kelly, and artists Kiki Smith, Sally Mann, Cathy de Monchaux and Nina Saunders. Vena Casa is an exhibition of six (gallery sited) sculptural installations. Each installation is contained within its own room or cell. Each cell is a choreographed environment that is intended to evoke an ambience influenced by or belonging to something like a hospital ward, or an institutional type setting. Each installation is accessed by a central passage. Each cell, or space, is lit in a minimal manner, to support the multiple themes of the hidden-abject, the melancholic, and of 'intimacy verses intrusion' - dark undercurrents that the sculptures themselves are intended to invoke...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{adopts a}} realist meta-perspective on {{a body of}} the scholar's own research papers written between 2005 and 2011, all either published or in press and offered for reference in the Appendices. The six papers represent the {{point of departure for}} the thesis; they are the phenomenon for further investigation into 'what must be the case' for the research events to have emerged as they did. One aspect of this study, therefore, is an auto ethnographic account of conducting research in the field of Academic Development within varied settings and over a given time frame. But alongside this personal history it narrates cycles in the Academic Development movement in South Africa over 30 years. Margaret Archer's Social Realist principle of analytical dualism (1995) is used to disaggregate the emergent properties within these histories and to enable an analysis of the underlying mechanisms that generated them. It refers to three social domains. Firstly, it describes the material structures - the institutional environments, policies, roles or professional conditions - in which the projects were conceived. Secondly, it identifies the cultural registers that the profession was drawing on - such as theories, beliefs or discourses. Thirdly, it draws attention to the agency of individuals and communities in the field as they independently activated or mediated these various conditioning structures and registers. So the study is a systematic examination of the parts and the people in research stories, of the complex interrelationship of structural and agential elements, and of how together they have generated particular forms of knowing and kinds of knowledge in Academic Development. Drawing from this 'history-within-a-history', the study makes some claims for 'what must be the case' for substantial knowledge to flourish in a newly emergent, hotly contested and relatively unstable field. It argues that Academic Development has few shared epistemological foundations and boundaries, and its roles and functions are shifting and diverse. It describes the tensions in the field between those who have been inclined to understand it as primarily <b>concerned</b> with <b>redress</b> or equity in the postapartheid state, and yet others who have prioritised Academic Development as an efficiency project within higher education. But there is a third discourse emanating from those in the profession who have consistently argued that neither of these approaches can succeed without drawing on stronger theoretical foundations. This study endorses the view that Academic Developers need to identify more coherent ontological and epistemological frames for their research work. This has important implications for building the kind of substantial knowledge base that could be more influential in addressing the troubled terrain of South African higher education. The study refers extensively to Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland (1865) and Through the Looking-Glass (1871) and to Mervyn Peake's 1946 illustrations of these children's stories, finding in these texts powerful analogies and metaphors for principles in realist philosophy and theory, and for describing a researcher's journey towards a more assured identity in the curious field of Academic Development. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{looks at}} critical interventions made by select San Francisco bay area choreographers and dance programmers interested in altering spectatorial norms for contemporary dance. Those selected have strategically employed food themes and materials in and as performance, simultaneously tapping into existing foodie ideology and <b>redressing</b> <b>concerns</b> about dwindling audiences for live dance {{performance in the}} twenty-first century. I argue that such efforts 1) bring to light subsumed race, class, and gender politics embedded in the trend towards "audience engagement," espoused by arts funders and dance makers alike as a necessary intervention {{for the survival of}} contemporary dance; and 2) open up discursive and experiential realms of possibility by favoring material, associative exchange, (re) awakening synesthetic sensory-perceptive capacities, inviting spectators to refigure themselves as co- creators in performance, and providing opportunities to reckon with exoticizing desires to enrich one's own culture by consuming another's. In theoretically grouping these choreographies together I illustrate a spectrum of responses that clarify how food-oriented performance gatherings can operate not only as strategies for altering audience relations, but as sites for alternative knowledge production and fruitful commensal exchange. Such research draws from and intervenes in the overlapping fields of food studies, American studies, and performance and dance studies. This analysis is uniquely positioned amongst other work addressing the interstices between food and performance in its emphasis explicitly on Western concert dance. It also contributes significantly to the archives of an often overlooked San Francisco bay area dance community. Methodologically I take a dance studies approach, generating choreographic analyses enabled through interviews with choreographers and dance programmers, my own work as witness/participant in the selected events, and archival research into feminist theories of performativity, anthropologies of the senses, contemporary theories of embodiment and select dance and theatre scholarship from the 1800 s to the present. Throughout I prioritize the embodied experience of spectatorship, highlighting how contemporary corporeality is shaped by shifting inclusions and exclusions of various peoples and practices, capitalist economic models, the pervasive reach of readily-available digitized media, and both dominant and alternative systems of knowledge production...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} to this thesis {{argues that it}} is not yet possible to exclude awareness of the social and political development of the West Indies from any adequate appreciation of the West Indian novel. It is suggested that national identity and cultural values in the region are so fluid as to make a rigorous defence of the autonomy of the work of art inappropriate. A brief description of West Indian society is provided. The factors which make it possible to regard the West Indian territories as a single region are discussed. Individual national characteristics are mentioned and the class structures and racial compositions-of the territories are examined. Literary criticism in the thesis is divided into three sections; the intention, in each case, is to show the way socio-cultural developments in the area have produced common themes {{in a wide range of}} West Indian novels. The first section suggests that there have been attempts by novelists to apply the concept of romantic love to man-woman relationships in the West Indies. It is further argued that the concept is alien to working class West Indian setting and that the European ideal of love has. been used as a criterion by which West Indian man-woman relationships are very often judged and presented as inadequate or negative. I suggest that an image of womanhood a West Indian literary concept of femininity - arises from the conflict between the European ideal and West Indian social reality. The second section is concerned with the growing West Indian need for a history and a way of seeing the past. I suggest that the matriarchal family-structure of the West Indian working-class has presented Caribbean novelists with a ready metaphor for examining history in fiction. The special importance of motherhood at one level of West Indian society has led to the use of the mother-child relationship as a convenient metaphor to describe the relationship between the society and its history and identity. The third section <b>concerns</b> attempts to <b>redress</b> the balance between the illegal occult practices of the West Indian folk (obeah) and the legal and "respectable" Christian religion. These attempts may depend on equal condemnation of obeah and Christianity as superstitions or on the presentation of both faiths as equally valid. The literary consequences of these two methods are examined...|$|R
40|$|Presented at GLOBELICS 2009, 7 th International Conference, 6 - 8 October, Dakar, Senegal. Parallel session 1 : Innovation {{policies}} for developmentPreviously released as Innogen Working Paper No. 69, January 2009. However pressing the distributional <b>concerns</b> of <b>redressing</b> inequality and overcoming poverty {{are in the}} short-run, {{in the long run}} meeting the development needs of humankind requires economic growth. This much is indisputable, although the composition of this growth - the weight given to different social and environmental parameters - is of course subject to contestation. Growth can arise from one or a combination of two different sources – an increase in the amount of investment applied to production (“extensive growth”), and an improvement in the quality of this investment (“intensive growth”). Most rapidly-growing economies draw on both the extensive and intensive margins. But, increasingly through the last three centuries, and inevitably even more so in the coming centuries as global resources are depleted, the focus of attention has been, and will be, placed on the intensive margin. And as we now have also realised, innovation and technological change lie at the centre of investment quality and therefore at the root of growth and development agendas. It was not always so. In {{the early part of the}} 20 th century as far as most analysts were concerned, the capacity of economic systems to produce more over time simply took place. And if it was determined by anything it was by the rate of investment i. e. by the rate of addition to the stock of capital within the economic system under consideration. This tradition was placed in question by a remarkable study carried out in 1956. Using conventional comparative static techniques, Robert Solow (1957) attempted to provide a statistical explanation of the causes of US manufacturing growth over the period 1911 - 56. He concluded that only around 12. 5 % of the observed growth of labour productivity (output per worker) over this period could be 'explained' by increments in the stock of capital, the remaining 87. 5 % being a 'residual' or an unexplained 'technological change' or ‘improvement in productivity'. What was significant about this study was that a major economic magnitude (the rate of economic growth) could not apparently be explained by the established causal variable. It was not so much the rate of investment that was important but rather the productivity of investment – and that remained unexplained. From that point on the growth agenda became one of identifying what these causal factors might be and clearly an important one was investment in science and technology. 1 In turn of course issues of science policy then became strategic since science was concerned above all with the creation of new knowledge much of this presumably economically useful. The link with the agenda for underdevelopment was just as significant since underlying all international poverty and inequality were poor economic conditions. It was this above all that gave rise to the drafting of the Sussex Manifesto by a group of policy-oriented social scientists at the Science Policy Research Unit and the Institute of Development Studies at Sussex University (Singer et. al., 1970). The Sussex Manifesto (hereafter, SM) reflected best-practice thinking at the time, and has continued to frame (or perhaps reflect) the dominant mode of thinking about, and the patterns of organising science policy in, and for, low income economies. It is a model which overwhelmingly focuses on science and technology as the primary source of technological change and the historically high-income northern economies as the primary locus of new technology and innovation. It has also tended statistically to conflate S&T with R&D expenditure. However, in recent years there have been major structural changes in processes of innovation, and in thinking about innovation processes. Little of this has filtered through to the development community which continues to run on old tramlines. In this paper we briefly review the old model (Section 2) and then focus on the new currents of thinking and practice about innovation, so-called Mode 2 innovation (Section 3). This is followed in Section 4 by a discussion of a series of emerging and outlier trends in innovation in various global settings. These trends offer the possibility for developing economies of disrupting dominant power relations in innovation, and also of better meeting the needs of the poor. This leads us in Section 5 to identify the potentially key role played by an innovation surge in the Asian Driver economies, and its potential relevance to meeting developmental needs in other low income economies. In this final section we also note however some outstanding science policy questions and the importance of keeping these questions alive in policy debates...|$|R
