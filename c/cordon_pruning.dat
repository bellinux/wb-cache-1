40|$|Poor budbreak {{and shoot}} growth were {{observed}} in Pinot noir in the Willamette Valley {{during the spring of}} 1988. The disorder was determined to be Early Temporary Boron Deficiency. This disorder generally occurs in California following dry fall weather. The fall of 1987 was one of the driest on record in Oregon. The severity of symptoms varied widely between vineyards. There was no clear pattern, but vineyards with heavier soils and <b>cordon</b> <b>pruning</b> seemed to be most affected. Pruning date seemed {{to be related to the}} disorder and, in several vineyards, late pruned vines were less affected than early pruned vines...|$|E
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the behaviour of different grapevine rootstocks is basic to achieve a good adaptation of vine to its growing area. With the objective of knowing the agronomic and qualitative response of cv. Sauvignon Blanc {{to the use of}} several rootstocks, a trial was established in 2006 in the D. O. Rueda. The vines are vertical trellised, with bilateral Royat <b>cordon</b> <b>pruning,</b> and the vine spacing is 2. 60 [*]m × 1. 25 [*]m. The row orientation is NNW (N- 25 °). The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks with 4 replications and elemental plot of 60 vines. Over the period 2010 – 2014 it has been developed the study of the following 10 rootstocks (treatments) : 110 R, 101 - 14 M, 420 A, 3309 C, 41 B, 161 - 49 C, 196 - 17 C, Fercal, Gravesac and RGM. The rootstocks 420 A and 41 B showed a production higher than 50 % with respect to 196 - 17 C and 161 - 49 C, and higher to 100 % than RGM, due to the number of clusters per vine and, in greater amount, to the cluster weight. Fercal and Gravesac showed an increase of pruning wood weight of 24 % with respect to 196 - 17 C and 161 - 49 C, and 90 % with respect to RGM, mainly due to the shoot weight. The sugar concentration increased with 101 - 14 M, 196 - 17 C and Fercal, and became reduced with 161 - 49 C, 41 B and RGM. The pH of must was reduced with Fercal whereas the titratable acidity increased, which also showed increase with Gravesac and 161 - 49 C. The tartaric acid hardly increased slightly with Fercal and 161 - 49 C, whereas the malic acid increased with Gravesac and Fercal, and was reduced with 41 B, 3309 C, RGM and 101 - 14 M. The potassium concentration increased with 196 - 17 C, Gravesac and Fercal, and was reduced with 41 B, 161 - 49 C, 420 A and 3309 C. The effects observed show alternatives for rootstock election according to the growing conditions and objectives of the vineyard...|$|E
5000|$|In 1997, Larner's father {{retired and}} her parents {{purchased}} a 134-acre ranch in Ballard Canyon, Santa Barbara, California. Monica helped to establish the vineyard; selecting clones, setting <b>cordons</b> and <b>pruning</b> vines. Stevan Larner died in a vineyard accident in 2005.

50|$|Single-stemmed trees planted at {{an angle}} (usually 45°), with fruiting spurs {{encouraged}} to form along the stem. Any side branches are removed by <b>pruning.</b> <b>Cordons</b> take less space and crop earlier than most other forms, so more varieties can be got into a small space, but yields are smaller per tree. A special cordon set-up is the Bouché-Thomas system.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this trial was {{to improve the quality}} of Merlot grapes, through the canopy management, to achieve better phenolic maturity without increasing the sugar content of the grapes. The vineyard located in Bolgheri (Tuscany-Italy) consisted of the cv. Merlot (clone 181 on 110 R) spaced at m 2. 0 x 0. 7, trained to horizontal spur <b>cordon,</b> <b>pruned</b> to 8 buds per vine, which were subjected to three types of canopy treatment on six randomized replications: FM) current farm management consisting of three shoot trimming (topping and hedging) made every 20 days, starting from the beginning of June (after fruit set); ELR) early basal shoot leaf removal at bloom followed by three shoot trimming every 20 days (like in treatment FM); NTD) None shoot trimming nor defoliation, rolling up the terminal part of the shoots, as adopted in biodynamic viticulture. The early defoliation determined a decrease in the number of berries per bunch (- 17 %) and the size of grapes at harvest (- 15 %) compared to the other thesis, moreover, did not affect the level of sugar at ripeness, leading to a significant increase of the phenol content (polyphenols, anthocyanins and total anthocyanins extracted). Instrumental analysis of phenol substances were perfectly compatible with those obtained by the of sensorial analysis panel which tested the berry maturity using a new method developed by our Department. More precisely a better cellular phenol maturity (skin and seed) and a greater attenuation of the bitter taste on berry sampled by the vines early defoliated were detected...|$|R
25|$|Mondeuse noire is a mid-ripening grape {{variety that}} tends to thrive on stony {{vineyard}} soils that have a high limestone and clay content. The vine can be very vigorous and high yielding which requires the <b>cordons</b> to be <b>pruned</b> short during the winter to keep the vine in check. Among the viticultural hazards that Mondeuse noire is susceptible to include chlorosis, mites, downy and powdery mildew. The vine is also very sensitive to drought conditions which may require irrigation in the vineyard.|$|R
30|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} for two successive seasons (2016 and 2017) in a private vineyard, called Electricity Station Farm, which is registered at ECOA control body, as a full organic farm, under the code number A 812, Wadi El Faregh, Wadi El-Natroun, El Beheira Governorate, Egypt to evaluate using organic products to reduce powdery mildew of Thompson seedless grapevines and their reflects on vine growth, fruits yield, quantity and quality. The chosen vines were 12  years old, grown in a sandy loam soil, spaced at (1.5 [*]×[*] 3.0  m) apart and irrigated, using drip irrigation system, trained to bilateral <b>cordon</b> with spur <b>pruning</b> and trellised by the “Y” shape system. The vines were pruned {{at the end of}} January in both seasons according to Fawzi et al. (2010).|$|R
40|$|Aims: Recent trials on Sangiovese vines {{have shown}} that hand {{defoliation}} of shoot basal leaves at pre-bloom is effective in reducing fruit set and yield, leading to better grape composition and quality. The present work was performed to access whether similar outcomes could be obtained by a more economically viable mechanical approach, {{which appears to be}} extremely attractive in cultivars such as Sangiovese, marked by high or very high yield potential and heavy, fairly compact clusters quite sensitive to rot. Methods and results : The trial was designed to compare pre-bloom mechanical defoliation (MD), hand defoliation (HD) and no defoliation (C) on Sangiovese vertical shoot positioned and spur <b>pruned</b> <b>cordon</b> de Royat trained vines. In the HD treatment, the first six basal leaves of each shoot were removed (70...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{calculate}} regression model between leaf area and shoot length to obtain leaf area evaluation by indirect method and the factors influencing this relathionship. This research was carried out for 4 years in a vineyard located in Trapani area on three red cultivars grafted onto 1103 p, trained to simple <b>cordon</b> system and <b>pruned</b> with different methods. The vines were drip irrigated. High correlation existed between leaf area and shoot length and no influence played numerousness of samples. b 1 of linear regression showed an increment of values at veraison than at berry set, because of b 1 increment in lateral shoots in manual pruning and in the main lateral shoots for the other two pruning system. Difficulty was found to apply a phenological linear equation to another stage. Only manual pruning linear equation showed positive result when applied in different years. Definetly, the use of a linear equation to estimate leaf area, determined an estimation error. It is still necessary to evaluate the error range determining no influence on evaluation of plant vegetative and physiological parameters...|$|R
