40|$|The {{companion}} paper {{described how}} <b>concrete</b> <b>blinding</b> {{can be used}} to prop retaining walls in cut and cover excavations prior to the completion of the base slab. In addition, it was demonstrated that the behaviour of blinding struts can be accurately predicted with nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEA) if the strut properties and ground profile are known. This paper presents a simple design-oriented analytical model which can be used for blinding struts as an alternative to NLFEA. The simplified model is shown to give comparable results to NLFEA and is attractive for design since it allows the effect of variations in imperfection amplitude and length to be rapidly assessed. A case study is presented which illustrates the use of the method and demonstrates that relatively thin blinding struts can resist the maximum axial forces likely to be encountered in cut and cover excavations...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIt {{is often}} {{admitted}} that a static system with more inputs (sources) than outputs (sensors, or channels) cannot be blindly identified, that is, identified {{only from the}} observation of its outputs, and without any a priori knowledge on the source statistics but their independence. By resorting to High-Order Statistics, {{it turns out that}} static MIMO systems with fewer outputs than inputs can be identified, as demonstrated in the present paper. The principle, already described in a recent rather theoretical paper, had not yet been applied to a <b>concrete</b> <b>blind</b> identification problem. Here, in order to demonstrate its feasibility, the procedure is detailed {{in the case of a}} 2 -sensor 3 -source mixture; a numerical algorithm is devised, that blindly identifies a 3 -input 2 -output mixture. Computer results show its behavior as a function of the data length when sources are QPSK-modulated signals, widely used in digital communications. Then another algorithm is proposed to extract the 3 sources from the 2 observations, once the mixture has been identified. Contrary to the first algorithm, this one assumes that the sources have a known discrete distribution. Computer experiments are run in the case of three BPSK sources in presence of Gaussian noise...|$|R
50|$|On 14 October 2015 {{temporary}} works erected over the busy M1 motorway collapsed onto the passing traffic. Two {{people were killed}} and 19 were injured in the collapse which blocked both the north and southbound traffic.At the time of the collapse very little permanent works had been executed by the contractor. Piling on the western side {{in the vicinity of the}} foundations for the pylon had been completed and on day of the collapse <b>blinding</b> <b>concrete</b> was being placed to the base of the pylon pile cap.|$|R
50|$|Regular {{concrete}} is the lay {{term for}} concrete that {{is produced by}} following the mixing instructions that are commonly published on packets of cement, typically using sand or other common material as the aggregate, and often mixed in improvised containers. The ingredients in any particular mix depends {{on the nature of}} the application. Regular concrete can typically withstand a pressure from about 10 MPa (1450 psi) to 40 MPa (5800 psi), with lighter duty uses such as <b>blinding</b> <b>concrete</b> having a much lower MPa rating than structural concrete. Many types of pre-mixed concrete are available which include powdered cement mixed with an aggregate, needing only water.|$|R
50|$|A {{new form}} of slab track, {{which can be used}} on long bridges, has been {{installed}} on the line. According to DB information, it is the only such system on the market. The Federal Railway Authority (Eisenbahn-Bundesamt, EBA) declined an application for the approval of the use of the slab track in May 2015. The construction was considered weak because of a compensating layer of unreinforced concrete, although this was an accepted engineering technique and was imported from building regulations. The reinforcement was mandatory {{in the view of the}} EBA for handling stresses. Evidence needed to be provided that dynamic loads did not create excessive tensile forces on the <b>blinding</b> <b>concrete.</b> The Authority was concerned that the concrete would thus show no cracks when rehabilitation was needed. Six bridges along the entire line are affected by this problem.|$|R
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of this research study, the specialist literature available in the Federal republic of Germany and bordering German-speaking countries concerning bitumen modification with Trinidad-Epure and polymer addition was evaluated and assessed. In this acitivity the main criteria were the effects produced on {{the properties of the}} bitumen and asphalt: wetting and compaction, adhesive strength, fatigue resistance, deformation resistance, resistance to crack formation, resistance to ageing. While for PmB there are disadvantages for the working properties with regard to the six tested use criteria and the ageing behaviour must be evaluated at least critically/no negative aspects were established for Trinidad-Epure. Taking into account the high resistance to deformation of the latter, despite uniform binder consistency in extremely low-cavity asphalt mixtures, with all the positive aspects of dense asphalt mixtures arising solely out of this, applications on roads with high traffic load are of advantage. This applies not only for mastic asphalt, asphalt <b>concrete</b> and <b>blinded</b> mastic asphalt surfacing but also for future, hopefully denser and thus longer-lived asphalt binder mixtures. The particularly marked cold flexibility and general elasticity, linked with good adhesive properties, also to the foundation, predetermines polymer-modified bitumen for use in thin surfacing. With open-pore coatings with high cavity contents and high quantities of binder, the use of high-polymer modified bitumen is recommended to achieve long life with a long duration of action regarding noise reduction. Finally, {{it can be said that}} there is limited equivalence between asphalts with bitumen and Trinidad-Epure and asphalts with polymer-modified bitumen. Advantages were mainly shown for the use of Trinidad-Epure. (orig.)

40|$|Modeling {{uncertainty}} {{can have}} a significant impact on the assessed risk of earthquake-induced damage and collapse in a building obtained through the performance-based earthquake engineering framework. This paper quantifies the effect of modeling uncertainty on performance-based risk assessments, accounting for differences in software platforms, solution algorithm, element-types, and model parameter calculation or selection, using results of the 7 -story reinforced <b>concrete</b> (RC) building <b>blind</b> prediction contest (2006) at University of California at San Diego (UCSD). The blind prediction test data provide a unique opportunity to quantify the influence of modeling uncertainty on structural response predictions. In this study, the bias and variability of predicted drift in the contest submissions are taken to represent modeling uncertainty. The modeling uncertainty quantified from the UCSD test submissions is combined with uncertainty due to record-to-record variability and a set of fragility curves are computed for different drift levels. The final fragility curves account for modeling and ground motion uncertainty. Results are compared with the results with no modeling uncertainty. The key contribution of this study is to investigate the uncertainty embedded in the response due to combination of ground motion and modeling uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} the {{proposal}} is a gallery of modern and new media art together with a community centre, {{which serves as a}} platform for creating projects in borderland between science and art. The form of the two separately standing buildings is significantly influenced by their surroundings. The modern barrier of the street Koliště is enhanced by <b>blind</b> <b>concrete</b> facades of the designed buildings. The unity with Cejl indicates reclusion, rawness and sense of community, especially significant is the parterre which is shaped as two atria with different levels of intimacy. The dominant feature of the project is a superelevated golden cube, which conceals the main space of the gallery. It is situated behind the wall of buildings and it looks down at the city centre, which is possible thanks to its height. The remaining space is located in lower level and it is less opulent, as it stands back to the street on one side and completely opens itself into atriums through glassed-in walls on the other side. The goal of the project was to extract and put into shape specific aspects of the place and to create a user-friendly environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} work aims at {{minimizing the}} environmental impact of the solid wastes (ash) that is produced after the utilization of the bituminous limestone in thermal power stations and /or retortion processes. Limy ash has been prepared from the El-Lajjun bituminous limestone by direct combustion at 1200, 950, and 525 °C respectively. The laboratory tests have been selected with respect to construction needs and possible post construction conditions. Utilization of the various types of ash in the stabilization problematic soils from Jordan as brown soils and the clayey marl has revealed optimum results. The unconfined compressive strength of the parent brown soil and the clayey marl has been raised from 5 kg/cm 2 to 50 and 25 kg/cm 2 respectively. The CBR value has been raised from 4. 5 % to 150 % for both problematic soil types. Various mortars and construction elements can be produced at normal room curing temperature without the use of ordinary Portland cement (OPC). Low quality sub-base and base course can be mixed with ash to produce cement treated base (CTB) and roller compacted concrete (RCC) without OPC. Durable pavements, embankments can be constructed with very long life and low cost. CTB and RCC utilizing ash can be used in dam construction instead of normal soil in earth fill dams. The high alkalinity of El-Lajjun ash is considered as a disadvantage to be utilized in normal concrete mixes for structural purposes. Ash only can be mixed with aggregates to produce lean <b>concrete</b> like for <b>blinding</b> purposes to be prepared for foundation activities 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} industry generally takes a conservative attitude towards adopting innovations. Previous research {{has tended to}} focus on information technology instead of heavy construction equipment. Also, the ‘process’ of adopting of new construction technologies by companies remains unexplored until now. In the previous part of the research the initial stages of technology adoption were examined including identification of the range of options available and comparison of the options in order to determine and collect any information that is missing for any of the options. With this in mind, this paper presents the initial investigation into the next part (phase) of the technology adoption process, which is found to involve analysis of the most viable options, involving a demonstration of the technology on the user’s site and / or discussion with other technology users, and the making of the final decision. A total of 35 interviews with participants from Australia and 63 from North America were undertaken. Participants {{from both sides of the}} process (i. e. customers and vendors) were chosen in order to cross-validate the findings of each group using triangulation. A total of 96 technologies were identified ranging in cost from $ 0. 75 M to $ 45 M, including mobile / tower cranes, <b>concrete</b> pumps, and <b>blind</b> bore shaft drills. The analysis revealed that a customer passes through three stages to make the adoption decision from the point where the customer is in the position to short list the number of technology options and vendors. The outcome confirmed the original hypothesis that the adoption process has well-defined stages starting with: a) Information analysis; b) technology evaluation; and c) adoption decision. These three stages are mirrored by vendor activities which respond to potential adopters. The analysis also highlighted the importance of word of mouth, feedback from experienced technology users, and negotiation in the process...|$|R
