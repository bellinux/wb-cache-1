5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1860s, Levski {{developed}} a revolutionary theory that saw the Bulgarian liberation movement as an armed uprising of all Bulgarians in the Ottoman Empire. The insurrection was to be prepared, controlled and coordinated internally by a central revolutionary organisation, which was to include local revolutionary <b>committees</b> <b>in</b> all parts of Bulgaria and operate independently from any foreign factors. Levski's theory resulted from the repeated failures to implement Rakovski's ideas effectively, {{such as the use of}} foreign-based armed detachments (чети, cheti) to provoke a general revolt. Levski's idea of an entirely independent revolution did not enjoy the approval of the entire population either—in fact, he was the only prominent Bulgarian revolutionary to advocate it. Instead, many regarded an intervention by the great powers as a more feasible solution.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{resigned}} from the Advisory Council on October 25, 1894 {{to run for the}} Senate. He was elected in November 1894 and served continuously through 1904.

5|$|Charlton was an {{immediate}} success with Andrew Fisher and was promoted to the temporary chairmanship of <b>committees</b> <b>in</b> the House in 1913, however Charlton threatened to resign in 1915 over a dispute in government delays in granting the committee increased powers. Fisher mollified him and in 1916 Charlton proved his loyalty to the new Labor leader Billy Hughes by voting for Hughes' conscription referendum bill, {{even though he was}} vehemently opposed to conscription and fought hard against it. However, Charlton seemed to accept the affirmative result of the referendum and again proved his loyalty to Hughes by defending him when he became the target of caucus criticism. Charlton attempted to deflect attacks made on Hughes to a party conference, but Hughes left the party before a decision could be made.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the work}} of the Scottish Parliament is done in committee. The role of {{committees}} is stronger in the Scottish Parliament than in other parliamentary systems, partly as a means of strengthening the role of backbenchers in their scrutiny of the government and partly to compensate for {{the fact that there is}} no revising chamber. The principal role of <b>committees</b> <b>in</b> the Scottish Parliament is to take evidence from witnesses, conduct inquiries and scrutinise legislation. Committee meetings take place on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning when Parliament is sitting. Committees can also meet at other locations throughout Scotland.|$|E
5|$|One of Madgwick's primary {{responsibilities}} as chairman was {{to answer questions}} and inquiries from the Commonwealth government and its <b>committees.</b> <b>In</b> 1968 the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts investigated the ABC's finances. In late 1971, the Estimates Committee investigated a concern about ABC employees sometimes refusing to disclose internal ABC information to government overseers. In August 1971 the Senate Standing Committees on Education, Science and the Arts conducted a general inquiry into radio and television. On every occasion, Madgwick, accompanied by ABC general manager Talbot Duckmanton, travelled to Canberra to answer each committee's questions. Under Madgwick, the ABC's annual budget grew from $50 million in 1969 to $90 million in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{and during}} Israel's 1982 {{invasion}} of Lebanon, al-Wazir planned numerous attacks inside Israel against both {{civilian and military}} targets. He prepared Beirut's defense against incoming Israeli forces. Nonetheless, the Israeli military prevailed and al-Wazir was exiled from Lebanon {{with the rest of}} the Fatah leadership. He settled in Amman for a two-year period and was then exiled to Tunis in 1986. From his base there, he started to organize youth <b>committees</b> <b>in</b> the Palestinian territories; these eventually became the backbone of the Palestinian forces in the First Intifada. However, he did not live to command the uprising. On April 16, 1988, he was assassinated at his home in Tunis, by Israeli commandos.|$|E

5|$|Republican President Benjamin Harrison (1889–1893) attempted, in 1893, to annex Hawaii {{through a}} Senate treaty. When this failed, {{he was asked}} to {{consider}} the Tyler joint house precedent; he declined. Democratic President Grover Cleveland (1893–1897) did not pursue the annexation of Hawaii. When President William McKinley took office in 1897, he quickly revived expectations among territorial expansionists when he resubmitted legislation to acquire Hawaii. When the two-thirds Senate support was not forthcoming, <b>committees</b> <b>in</b> the House and Senate explicitly invoked the Tyler precedent for the joint house resolution, which was successfully applied to approve the annexation of Hawaii in July 1898.|$|E
5|$|The {{organizing}} {{committee for the}} 2009 championships met in Oslo with the {{organizing committee}} of the 2011 championships on 20 April 2009 to discuss lessons learned.

5|$|In 1930, White {{was elected}} {{to serve in the}} West Virginia Senate {{representing}} the state's Fifteenth Senatorial District. He served in the 40th and 41st Sessions of the West Virginia Legislature and completed his term in 1934. During the 1932 legislative year, the West Virginia Senate was led by the Republican Party majority. The following legislative year in 1933, White served as the floor leader for the West Virginia Senate's Democratic Party members. The West Virginia Senate's majority had shifted to the Democrats in 1933, and in January 1933, White was selected by A. G. Mathews, President of the West Virginia Senate, as chairman of the senate's Judiciary Committee. In this position, White introduced twelve bills in 1933 to correct errors and omissions in existing statutes. Also in the 1933 legislative year, White served as a member on the Finance; Roads and Navigation; Counties, Municipal Corporations; Rules; Medicine and Sanitation; Education; Privileges and Elections; and Redistricting <b>committees.</b> <b>In</b> the same year White was also appointed as a member on two special senate committees.|$|E

5|$|In other countries, {{the state}} played a {{stronger}} {{role in the}} process of commissioning memorials. France, for example, mostly relied on local communities to organise and commission most war memorials, but the state played a comparatively larger role than in Britain and similar countries. A law was passed in 1919 establishing an official role for local government officials {{in the process of}} commissioning memorials; many towns then formed committees to take this process forward, typically at the commune level. Members of the Souvenir Français organisation {{played an important role in}} many of the resulting local <b>committees.</b> <b>In</b> other cases, governments increased their role in commissioning memorials during the inter-war period. In Romania, most memorials in the early 1920s were initially erected by local communities; in 1919 the royal family created the Societatea Cultul Eroilor Morţi to oversee commemoration of the war more generally; the organisation was headed by the Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church. By the 1930s official concern over the diverse range of designs led to increased central control over the process.|$|E
5|$|To {{generate}} {{support for}} the scheme, the provisional committee initiated a public campaign led by Joseph Lawrence, {{who had worked for}} the Hull and Barnsley Railway. His task was to set up <b>committees</b> <b>in</b> every ward in Manchester and throughout Lancashire, to raise subscriptions and sell the idea to the local public. The first meeting was held on 4 October in Manchester's Oxford Ward, followed by another on 17October in the St. James Ward. Within a few weeks meetings had been held throughout Manchester and Salford, culminating in a conference on 3 November attended by the provisional committee and members of the various Ward Committees. A large meeting of the working classes, attended by several local notables including the general secretaries of several trade unions, was held on 13November at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester.|$|E
5|$|William Edmiston was a Mason and {{a member}} of the Old Timers' Association, the Sons of Scotland, Knights of Pythias, Edmonton Liberal-Conservative Association and Edmonton Board of Trade.
