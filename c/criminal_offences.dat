5|$|During {{his days}} as the Agong, Sultan Iskandar was often seen in public {{carrying}} a pistol in his waistband, which drew considerable concern and discomfort from the Malaysian public due to his past record of <b>criminal</b> <b>offences.</b> He was also reputed to have led a flamboyant lifestyle, which also drew similar scepticism. He was also {{known to be a}} motorbike enthusiast; documentaries on national patriotism would feature Sultan Iskandar, the then-Agong, riding out on a police motorbike and his flamboyant appearance during a few public ceremonies.

The third chapter deals with the legal aspects of the reconstruction of <b>criminal</b> <b>offence,</b> specifically its embedding in the criminal law. The fourth chapter discusses the difference between the reconstruction of <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> and the other methods of investigation, such as the initial investigation, verification of statements on the site and the inspection of the scene of crime. The fifth chapter concentrates on the psychological aspects of carrying out the reconstruction of <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> [...] . ...|$|R

The British government, worried that Southern Rhodesia might issue a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) rather than continue with negotiations, placed troops in Aden on alert.|$|E

5|$|The Song {{judicial}} system retained {{most of the}} legal code of the earlier Tang dynasty, the basis of traditional Chinese law up until the modern era. Roving sheriffs maintained {{law and order in}} the municipal jurisdictions and occasionally ventured into the countryside. Official magistrates overseeing court cases were not only expected to be well-versed in written law but also to promote morality in society. Magistrates such as the famed Bao Qingtian (999â€“1062) embodied the upright, moral judge who upheld justice and never {{failed to live up to}} his principles. Song judges specified the guilty person or party in a criminal act and meted out punishments accordingly, often in the form of caning. A guilty individual or parties brought to court for a criminal or civil offense were not viewed as wholly innocent until proven otherwise, while even accusers were viewed with a high level of suspicion by the judge. Due to costly court expenses and immediate jailing of those accused of <b>criminal</b> <b>offences,</b> people in the Song preferred to settle disputes and quarrels privately, without the court's interference.|$|E
5|$|The Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 {{provides}} for Ofcom to issue licences to radio broadcasters {{for the use}} of stations and wireless telegraphy apparatus. The Act sets out a number of <b>criminal</b> <b>offences</b> relating to wireless telegraphy, including the establishment or use of a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of making an unlicensed broadcast. The financing or participating in the day-to-day running of unlicensed broadcasting is also a criminal offence, as is the supplying of a sound recording for an unlicensed station and advertising through unlicensed stations. The Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 allows Ofcom to take a number of actions against individuals committing these offences, including power of entry and search and seizure of equipment. It is a criminal offence to obstruct a person exercising enforcement powers on Ofcom's behalf. Furthermore, the Broadcasting Act 1990 provides that anyone convicted of an unlawful broadcasting offence is disqualified from holding a broadcasting licence for five years.|$|E
5|$|The social {{problems}} arising from alcoholism are serious, {{caused by the}} pathological changes {{in the brain and}} the intoxicating effects of alcohol. Alcohol abuse is associated with an increased risk of committing <b>criminal</b> <b>offences,</b> including child abuse, domestic violence, rape, burglary and assault. Alcoholism is associated with loss of employment, which can lead to financial problems. Drinking at inappropriate times, and behavior caused by reduced judgment, can lead to legal consequences, such as criminal charges for drunk driving or public disorder, or civil penalties for tortious behavior, and may lead to a criminal sentence. An alcoholic's behavior and mental impairment, while drunk, can profoundly affect those surrounding them and lead to isolation from family and friends. This isolation can lead to marital conflict and divorce, or contribute to domestic violence. Alcoholism can also lead to child neglect, with subsequent lasting damage to the emotional development of the alcoholic's children. For this reason, children of alcoholic parents can develop a number of emotional problems. For example, they can become afraid of their parents, because of their unstable mood behaviors. In addition, they can develop considerable amount of shame over their inadequacy to liberate their parents from alcoholism. As a result of this failure, they develop wretched self-images, which can lead to depression.|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} presence of eventual differential specificities between patients with paranoid schizophrenia who are perpetrator of <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> and ones who arenâ€™t. Research was made on a sample of 122 patients with diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia F 20. 0, 61 of them were perpetrators of <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> and they were treated by the court order, and 61 werenâ€™t perpetrators of <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> and they were treated by indications for hospital treatment. Participants were equaled by gender, age and education. All participants were tested by questionnaires: Wechsler WB for analyzing intellectual abilities, MMPI- 201 for analyzing pathological characteristics of personality, Eysenckâ€™s Personality Questionnaire (EPQ_RA), Freiburg Personality Inventory (FPI), Life Style Index (LSI), Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and Sociodemographic Data Questionnaire. Set of diagnostic measure instruments was used to try to determine presence of interdependence of psychopathological symptoms and other factors from possible impact on perpetration of <b>criminal</b> <b>offence,</b> and to correlate it with a group of non-perpetrators of <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> in same diagnostic category. Ultimate aim {{of this study}} was to determine eventual factors which would be significant in prediction of future criminal behavior. Researches show that paranoid-schizophrenic perpetrators of <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> are significantly more present in a category of violent criminality, including homicide, in relation to distribution of perpetration of <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> in general population. Perpetratorsâ€™ of <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> victims are mostly within family and relatives population. In a group of perpetrators of <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> there is comorbidity of more personality disorders, earlier prison experience and earlier forensic treatment, impact of psychoactive substances tempore acti, and in a group of non-perpetration of <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> there is more alcohol addictions, but without statistical significance. In this research presence of psychopatological and criminal specificities are comfirmed in criminal defense perpetrators wich differ them from non-perpetrators of criminal defense. Three predicting models significant in prediction of criminal defense were identified. We consider results of this study more as probable tendencies than firm facts, so this study refer to further research in specific behavior of paranoid-schizophrenic patients, on a greater pattern, to enable usage of preventive and therapeutic programs for this group of patients adequately and on time...|$|R

5|$|The Croatian parliament's {{powers are}} defined by the Constitution of Croatia. These include: {{defining}} economic, legal and political relations in the Republic of Croatia; preservation of Croatia's natural and cultural heritage and its utilisation; and forming alliances with other states. The parliament {{has the right to}} deploy Croatian armed forces abroad. It may also restrict constitutional rights and liberties in wartime or in cases of imminent war or following natural disasters, although that constitutional provision is limited to specific rightsâ€”right to life, prohibition of torture, cruel or denigrating conduct or punishment, upholding of habeas corpus and freedoms of thought, conscience and religious views. In addition, in those circumstances parliamentary members' terms may be extended. (As these rights {{are defined by}} the constitution, the decision would require a two-thirds majority. Since Croatia never declared a state of war during the breakup of Yugoslavia, this option has not been exercised in practice.) The parliament reserves the right to amend the borders of Croatia. The parliament decides on constitutional amendments, enacts legislation, passes the state budget, declares war and decides on the cessation of hostilities, adopts declarations of policy of the parliament, adopts national defence strategy, representing a long-term defence resource planning document, and national defence strategy, which defines bases for establishment and implementation of institutions, measures and activities in response to general security issues and specific challenges and threats to Croatia, implements civil supervision of the armed forces and security services, calls referenda, performs elections and appointments conforming to the constitution and applicable legislation, supervises operations of the government (headed by the Prime Minister of Croatia) and other civil services responsible to the parliament, grants amnesty for <b>criminal</b> <b>offences</b> and performs various other duties defined by the constitution.
