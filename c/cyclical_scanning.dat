In this technology, +/- 1 -order diffractive beams are generated by a phase grating and selected by a spatial filter. Meanwhile, a 4 f system enables the +/- 1 -order diffractive beams to form a grating image with a clear jagged-edge boundary on the substrate. A high-precision two-dimensional (2 D) mobile stage is used for complementary <b>cyclical</b> <b>scanning,</b> thereby effectively eliminating image stitching errors. The absence of such errors results in a seamless and uniform large-sized grating. Characterized by a simple structure, high energy use, and good stability, this lithography system is highly relevant to the high-speed and cost-effective production of large-sized gratings...|$|E

40|$|Test {{data volume}} and power {{consumption}} for scan vectors {{are two major}} problems in system-on-a-chip testing. Since static compaction of scan vectors invariably leads to higher power for scan testing, the conflicting goals of low-power scan testing and reduced test data volume appear to be irreconcilable. We tackle this problem by using test data compression to reduce both test data volume and scan power. In particular, we show that Golomb coding of precomputed test sets leads to significant savings in peak and average power, without requiring either a slower scan clock or blocking logic in the scan cells.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{real-time}} disk scheduling algorithm, Concurrent Scheduler or CSched, which maximizes throughput for modern storage devices while providing real-time access guarantees, with computational costs of O(log n). To maximize performance it ensures request concurrency at the device and maximizes {{the depth of}} a new Limited <b>Cyclical</b> <b>SCAN</b> (L-CSCAN) queue that optimizes the request sequence sent to the device. For realtime requests there is an additional SCAN-EDF queue {{in front of the}} L-CSCAN queue to absorb bursts of realtime requests until they can be drained to the L-CSCAN queue. The real-time guarantees are provided by managing the worst-case latency at each stage of the pipeline: SCAN-EDF, L-CSCAN, and device. CSched is configured by the tuple {λ, σ, δ, τ(r), N}, where λ and σ are the minimal initial slack time and workload burstiness and are properties of the workload, and where δ, τ(r), and N are the device worst-case latency, worst-case throughput rate time for a request, and maximal number of concurrent requests, and are experimentally determined properties of the storage device. An experimental evaluation of CSched shows that given sufficient initial slack time, the system throughput performance costs of providing real-time guarantees are negligible...|$|R

It was characterized by spectroscopic methods such as FT-IR, UV-vis, mass spectra, elemental analysis and cyclic voltammetry. The molecular structure of Cu(II) -L has also been confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. The electrochemical behavior of copper(II) -Schiff base complex containing pyrrol groups has been investigated in DMF and acetonitrile solutions using cyclic voltammetry. Thus, conducting polymeric films of polypyrrole were obtained on the surfaces of glassy carbon and ITO electrodes using copper(II) complex as monomer. The modified electrodes were electrochemically and morphologically characterized and their electrocatalytic properties in heterogeneous phase have also been investigated. The AFM studies show that the morphology of polypyrrole (PPy) films on ITO-electrodes depends on the number of <b>cyclical</b> <b>scans.</b> The electrocatalytic performances of this complex seem to be more efficient towards the electro-oxidation of isopropylic alcohol than any other kinds of alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and benzyl alcohol.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} a FIA system for the automatic determination of uric acid in urine, using a tubular amperometric detector. In this system, glassy carbon electrodes of tubular configuration were activated by successive <b>cyclical</b> <b>scans</b> from - 0. 30 to 2. 00 V versus Ag/AgCl reference electrode in 0. 50 mol. L- 1 sulphuric acid solution. Samples were diluted in supporting electrolyte before analysis and no other pre-treatment was employed. Such dilution enabled the matrix effects to be reduced and therefore improving the sensitivity provided by the activation step that allows the uric acid (UA) to be detected at lower concentration levels after dilution. Uric acid determination was performed in a single channel FIA manifold, which provided reproducibility of sample transport to the detector and enabled a sampling rate of 120 samples per hour to be achieved. The tubular configuration of the cell offered robustness to the system since it was rigidly fixed to the manifold, allowing the manifold to be generalised for routine analysis application. The results obtained with the FIA system for UA determination in urine were compared with those from the enzymatic method used in clinical analysis laboratories. No statistical difference between methods was found at the 95 % confidence level. Relative deviations between both methods were within ± 4 % and the proposed system showed good repeatability (about 3 %, n = 10) ...|$|R
