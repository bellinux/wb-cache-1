40|$|The Mexican wild potato species Solanum pinnatisectum is an {{important}} gene source for resistance to <b>Colorado</b> potato <b>beetle</b> and late blight. Diploid progenies segregating for resistance genes to <b>Colorado</b> potato <b>beetle</b> were developed by crossing S. pinnatisectum with S. cardiophyllum. The hybrid lines were resistant to <b>Colorado</b> potato <b>beetle.</b> A resistant hybrid line from this cross was selected and backcrossed as a female to S. cardiophyllum to generate a backcross progeny. This backcross progeny was tested for genetic architecture of the <b>Colorado</b> potato <b>beetle</b> resistance gene. Resistance percentage of the test lines over the control was determined for statistical analysis. The Chi square test result showed a significant 1 : 3 (resistance: susceptible) ratio in this backcrossing population, indicating that resistance in S. pinnatisectum to <b>Colorado</b> potato <b>beetle</b> may be controlled by two independently segregating major genes having two respective loci, acting in a complementary epistatic manner.

2500|$|Button {{was born}} on 19 January 1980 in Frome, Somerset and brought up in nearby Vobster. He was named after his father's Danish friend and rallycross {{opponent}} Erling Jensen, changing the [...] "e" [...] to an [...] "o" [...] to differentiate it from Jensen Motors. He was educated at Vallis First School, Selwood Middle School and Frome Community College. He is the fourth child of South African Simone Lyons and former Rallycross driver John Button, who was {{well known in the}} UK during most of the 1970s for his so-called <b>Colorado</b> <b>Beetle</b> Volkswagen, before switching to a VW Golf Mk1 in 1978. After his parents divorced when he was seven, he and his three elder sisters were brought up by their mother in Frome. However, after a while the boy moved to his stepmother Pippa Kerr, who had been married by his father in 1994. When Jenson was 19 years of age John Button and Pipa Kerr divorced. Button junior failed his first driving test for getting too close to a parked vehicle.|$|E
60|$|It {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{remarkable}} examples of the limitation of human powers that while we can easily exterminate large animals like the wolf and the bear in England, or the puma and the wolverine in the settled States of America, we should be so comparatively weak against the <b>Colorado</b> <b>beetle</b> or the fourteen-year locust, and so absolutely powerless against the hop-fly, the turnip-fly, and the phylloxera. The smaller and the more insignificant our enemy, viewed individually, the more difficult is he to cope with in the mass. All the elephants in the world could have been hunted down and annihilated, in all probability, with far less labour than has been expended upon one single little all but microscopic parasite in France alone. The enormous rapidity of reproduction in the family of aphides is the true cause of our helplessness before them. It has been calculated that a single aphis may during its own lifetime become the progenitor of 5,904,900,000 descendants. Each imperfect female produces about ninety young ones, and lives long enough to see its children's children to the fifth generation. Now, ninety multiplied by ninety four times over gives the number above stated. Of course, this makes no allowance for casualties which must be pretty frequent: but even so, the sum-total of aphides produced within a small garden in a single summer must be something very extraordinary.|$|E
60|$|It is {{just the}} same {{with all the other}} animals and plants that now inhabit these isles of Britain. If there be {{anything}} at all with a claim to be considered really indigenous, it is the Scotch ptarmigan and the Alpine hare, the northern holygrass and the mountain flowers of the Highland summits. All the rest are sojourners and wayfarers, brought across as casuals, like the gipsies and the Oriental plane, at various times to the United Kingdom, some of them recently, some of them long ago, but not one of them (it seems), except the oyster, a true native. The common brown rat, for instance, as everybody knows, came over, not, it is true, with William the Conqueror, but with the Hanoverian dynasty and King George I. of blessed memory. The familiar cockroach, or 'black beetle,' of our lower regions, is an Oriental importation of the last century. The hum of the mosquito is now just beginning to be heard in the land, especially in some big London hotels. The <b>Colorado</b> <b>beetle</b> is hourly expected by Cunard steamer. The Canadian roadside erigeron is well established already in the remoter suburbs; the phylloxera battens on our hothouse vines; the American river-weed stops the navigation on our principal canals. The Ganges and the Mississippi have long since flooded the tawny Thames, as Juvenal's cynical friend declared the Syrian Orontes had flooded the Tiber. And what has thus been going on slowly within the memory of the last few generations has been going on constantly from time immemorial, and peopling Britain in all its parts with its now existing fauna and flora.|$|E

40|$|Glycoalkaloids {{are found}} {{throughout}} the genera Solanum (potato) and Lycopersicon (tomato). Certain glycoalkaloids, i. e., α-tomatine, solanocardenine, and leptine, have been implicated as resistance factors to the <b>Colorado</b> potato <b>beetle,</b> Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say. The allelochemical properties of these glycoalkaloids have primarily been demonstrated by studies in p/anta, correlating <b>Colorado</b> potato <b>beetle</b> resistance {{with high levels of}} foliar glycoalkaloids: solanocardenine in S. neocardenasii, α-tomatine in S. pinnatisectum, and leptine in S. chacoense. Although the evidence that these glycoalkaloids mediate resistance is compelling, controlled analyses of <b>Colorado</b> potato <b>beetle</b> response to purified glycoalkaloids, fed to insects in synthetic diets, are necessary to characterize the allelochemic nature of these compounds. In this study, <b>Colorado</b> potato <b>beetle</b> reared on a meridic, synthetic diet supplemented with increasing concentrations of α-tomatine exhibit retarded growth and delayed development. These effects were evident throughout the insects 2 ̆ 7 development, from egg to prepupal stage.

60|$|That is why I {{have thought}} that a {{treatise}} De Banana might not, perhaps, be wholly without its usefulness to the modern English reading world. After all, a food-stuff which supports hundreds of millions among our beloved tropical fellow-creatures ought to be very dear {{to the heart of}} a nation which governs (and annually kills) more black people, taken in the mass, than all the other European powers put together. We have introduced the blessings of British rule--the good and well-paid missionary, the Remington rifle, the red-cotton pocket-handkerchief, and the use of 'the liquor called rum'--into so many remote corners of the tropical world that it is high time we should begin in return to learn somewhat about fetiches and fustic, Jamaica and jaggery, bananas and Buddhism. We know too little still about our colonies and dependencies. 'Cape Breton an island!' cried King George's Minister, the Duke of Newcastle, in the well-known story, 'Cape Breton an island! Why, so it is! God bless my soul! I must go and tell the King that Cape Breton's an island.' That was a hundred years ago; but only the other day the Board of Trade placarded all our towns and villages with a flaming notice to the effect that the <b>Colorado</b> <b>beetle</b> had made its appearance at 'a town in Canada called Ontario,' and might soon be expected to arrive at Liverpool by Cunard steamer. The right honourables and other high mightinesses who put forth the notice in question were evidently unaware that Ontario is a province as big as England, including in its borders Toronto, Ottawa, Kingston, London, Hamilton, and other large and flourishing towns. Apparently, in spite of competitive examinations, the schoolmaster is still abroad in the Government offices.|$|E
6000|$|Then, again, {{the order}} of the Cephalopods, to which belong the cuttle-fish and the octopus (sacred to Victor Hugo), may be, for all we can say to the contrary, an order with a future. Their kindred, the Gastropods, have, {{in the case of the}} snail and slug, learnt the trick of air-breathing. And not improbably there are even now genera of this order that have escaped the naturalist, or even {{well-known}} genera whose possibilities in growth and dietary are still unknown. Suppose some day a specimen of a new species is caught off the coast of Kent. It excites remark at a Royal Society soirée, engenders a Science Note or so, [...] "A Huge Octopus!" [...] and in the next year or so three or four other specimens come to hand, and the thing becomes familiar. [...] "Probably a new and larger variety of Octopus so-and-so, hitherto supposed to be tropical," [...] says Professor Gargoyle, and thinks he has disposed of it. Then conceive some mysterious boating accidents and deaths while bathing. A large animal of this kind coming into a region of frequent wrecks might so easily acquire a preferential taste for human nutriment, just as the <b>Colorado</b> <b>beetle</b> acquired a new taste for the common potato and gave up its old food-plants some years ago. Then perhaps a school or pack or flock of Octopus gigas would be found busy picking the sailors off a stranded ship, and then in the course of a few score years it might begin to stroll up the beaches and batten on excursionists. Soon it would be a common feature of the watering-places--possibly at last commoner than excursionists. Suppose such a creature were to appear--and it is, we repeat, a possibility, if perhaps a remote one--how could it be fought against? Something might be done by torpedoes; but, so far as our past knowledge goes, man has no means of seriously diminishing the numbers of any animal of the most rudimentary intelligence that made its fastness in the sea.|$|E
6000|$|Why {{is there}} a {{different}} standard of judgment with regard to a writer who plays much the same part in literature as the excessive talker plays in what is traditionally called conversation? The busy Adrastus, whose professional engagements might seem more than enough for the nervous energy of one man, and who yet finds time to print essays on the chief current subjects, from the tri-lingual inscriptions, or the Idea of the Infinite among the prehistoric Lapps, to the <b>Colorado</b> <b>beetle</b> and the grape disease {{in the south of}} France, is generally praised if not admired for the breadth of his mental range and his gigantic powers of work. Poor Theron, who has some original ideas on a subject to which he has given years of research and meditation, has been waiting anxiously from month to month to see whether his condensed exposition will find a place in the next advertised programme, but sees it, on the contrary, regularly excluded, and twice the space he asked for filled with the copious brew of Adrastus, whose name carries custom like a celebrated trade-mark. Why should the eager haste to tell what he thinks on the shortest notice, as if his opinion were a needed preliminary to discussion, get a man the reputation of being a conceited bore in conversation, when nobody blames the same tendency if it shows itself in print? The excessive talker can only be in one gathering at a time, and there is the comfort of thinking that everywhere else other fellow-citizens who have something to say may get a chance of delivering themselves; but the exorbitant writer can occupy space and spread over it the more or less agreeable flavour of his mind in four [...] "mediums" [...] at once, and on subjects taken from the four winds. Such restless and versatile occupants of literary space and time should have lived earlier when the world wanted summaries of all extant knowledge, and this knowledge being small, there was the more room for commentary and conjecture. They might have played the part of an Isidor of Seville or a Vincent of Beauvais brilliantly, and the willingness to write everything themselves would have been strictly in place. In the present day, the busy retailer of other people's knowledge which he has spoiled in the handling, the restless guesser and commentator, the importunate hawker of undesirable superfluities, the everlasting word-compeller who rises early in the morning to praise what the world has already glorified, or makes himself haggard at night in writing out his dissent from what nobody ever believed, is not simply [...] "gratis anhelans, multa agendo nihil agens"--he is an obstruction. Like an incompetent architect with too much interest at his back, he obtrudes his ill-considered work where place ought to have been left to better men.|$|E
