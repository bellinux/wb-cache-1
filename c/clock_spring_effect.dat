50|$|In vehicle {{steering}} systems a <b>clock</b> <b>spring</b> or clockspring is a spiral-wound special {{rotary electrical}} connector which allows a vehicle's steering wheel to turn while still making an electrical {{connection between the}} steering wheel airbag and/or the vehicle's horn and other devices and the vehicle's electrical systems.

40|$|This first {{quarterly}} {{report of the}} project presents the activity and conclusions reached to date. Specifically, several of the design parameters of the field eddy current array have been determined and the overall approach to {{data collection and analysis}} selected.

25|$|An {{interesting}} {{point of the}} design was {{that it did not}} use a traditional helical coiled recoil spring, but used a spiral spring, much like a large <b>clock</b> <b>spring,</b> in a semicircular housing {{just in front of the}} trigger. The operating rod had a toothed underside, which engaged with a cog which wound the spring. When the gun fired, the bolt recoiled and the cog was turned, tightening the spring until the resistance of the spring had reached the recoil force of the bolt assembly. At that moment, as the gas pressure in the breech fell, the spring unwound, turning the cog, which, in turn, wound the operating rod forward for the next round. As with a <b>clock</b> <b>spring,</b> the Lewis gun recoil spring had an adjustment device to alter the recoil resistance for variations in temperature and wear. Unusual as it seems, the Lewis design proved reliable and was even copied by the Japanese and used extensively by them during the Second World War.|$|R
50|$|The {{action was}} gas-operated, with the piston {{working in a}} {{cylinder}} beneath and integral with the barrel. The Johnston {{did not use the}} Lewis's prominent <b>clock</b> <b>spring.</b> Cocking of the piece was unusual, the entire pistol grip sliding forwards to engage the action, then returning backwards to cock it. This was first unlocked by a trigger-like mechanism in a cutout through the grip, behind the firing trigger.|$|R

50|$|Although {{the entire}} {{province}} is geographically within the MST (UTC-7) zone, the province is officially {{part of the}} Central time zone (UTC-6). As a result, while most of Saskatchewan does not change <b>clocks</b> <b>spring</b> and fall, it technically observes DST year round. This means that clocks {{in most of the}} province match clocks in Winnipeg during the winter and Calgary and Edmonton during the summer. This time zone designation was implemented in 1966, when the Saskatchewan Time Act was passed in order to standardize time province-wide.|$|R

30|$|Frequency tuning of an AVC-driven microscanner was {{demonstrated}} by utilizing the electromechanical <b>spring</b> <b>effect.</b> The resonant frequency was tuned by applying a dc tuning voltage up to 30  V to the tuning comb electrode with four different driving voltages. A maximum frequency shift of 3.2 % was achieved, as the resonant frequency of 3167  Hz {{was reduced to}} 3066  Hz when a tuning voltage of 30  V {{was applied to the}} tuning comb electrode. Further, the frequency shift of the microscanner was unidirectional. The application of a tuning voltage reduced the resonant frequency because of the spring-softening characteristics of the electromechanical <b>spring</b> <b>effect</b> for the given AVC-driven geometries. By utilizing the electromechanical <b>spring</b> <b>effect</b> of the AVC drive, frequency tuning of the microscanner was achieved without adding any permanent modification to the device structures.|$|R

50|$|A {{sash window}} is the {{traditional}} style of window in the United Kingdom, and many other places that were formerly colonized by the UK, with two parts (sashes) that overlap slightly and slide up and down inside the frame. The two parts {{are not necessarily the}} same size; where the upper sash is smaller (shorter) it is termed a cottage window. Currently most new double-hung sash windows use spring balances to support the sashes, but traditionally, counterweights held in boxes {{on either side of the}} window were used. These were and are attached to the sashes using pulleys of either braided cord or, later, purpose-made chain. Three types of spring balances are called a tape or <b>clock</b> <b>spring</b> balance; channel or block-and-tackle balance; and a spiral or tube balance.|$|R
50|$|The antenna {{includes}} two conductive spirals or arms, {{extending from the}} center outwards. The antenna may be a flat disc, with conductors resembling a pair of loosely nested <b>clock</b> <b>springs,</b> or the spirals may extend in a three-dimensional shape like a screw thread. The direction of rotation of the spiral defines the direction of antenna polarization. Additional spirals may be included as well, to form a multi-spiral structure. Usually the spiral is cavity-backed, that {{is there is a}} cavity of air or non-conductive material or vacuum, surrounded by conductive walls; the cavity changes the antenna pattern to a unidirectional shape. The output of the antenna is a balanced line. If one input or output line is desired, for example a coaxial line, then a balun or other device is added to so transform the signals.|$|R

Wassmann is unusual among artists in that he does not sell his work, rather they are presented as gifts; by not allowing these works to re-enter the consumer cycle, he averts the commodification of his end product.|$|R
5000|$|The steel was {{produced}} in specialised workshops called 'crucible furnaces', which consisted of a workshop at ground level and a subterranean cellar. The furnace buildings varied in size and architectural style, growing in size towards {{the latter part of}} the 19th century as technological developments enabled multiple pots to be [...] "fired" [...] at once, using gas as a heating fuel. Each workshop had a series of standard features, such as rows of melting holes, teaming pits, roof vents, rows of shelving for the crucible pots and annealing furnaces to prepare each pot before firing. Ancillary rooms for weighing each charge and for the manufacture of the clay crucibles were either attached to the workshop, or located within the cellar complex. The steel, originally intended for making <b>clock</b> <b>springs,</b> was later used in other applications such as scissors, axes and swords.|$|R
