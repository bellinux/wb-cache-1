50|$|Cocamide is the {{structural}} basis of many surfactants. Common are ethanolamines (cocamide MEA, cocamide DEA), betaine compounds (cocamidopropyl betaine), and hydroxysultaines (<b>cocamidopropyl</b> <b>hydroxysultaine).</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Cocamidopropyl</b> <b>hydroxysultaine</b> (CAHS) is a {{synthetic}} amphoteric surfactant from the hydroxysultaine group. It {{is found in}} personal care products (soaps, shampoos, lotions etc.). It has uses as a foam booster, viscosity builder, and an antistatic agent.|$|E
50|$|Zwitterionic (amphoteric) {{surfactants}} {{have both}} cationic and anionic centers {{attached to the}} same molecule. The cationic part is based on primary, secondary, or tertiary amines or quaternary ammonium cations. The anionic part can be more variable and include sulfonates, as in the sultaines CHAPS (3-(3-Cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio-1-propanesulfonate) and <b>cocamidopropyl</b> <b>hydroxysultaine.</b> Betaines such as cocamidopropyl betaine have a carboxylate with the ammonium. The most common biological zwitterionic surfactants have a phosphate anion with an amine or ammonium, such as the phospholipids phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelins.|$|E
