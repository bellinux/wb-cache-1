40|$|Energy {{generation}} from intermittent {{renewable sources}} introduces additional variability into electrical systems, {{resulting in a}} higher cost of balancing against the increased variabilities. Ways to balance demand and supply for electricity include using flexible generation resources, storage operations, and <b>curtailing</b> intermittent generation. This paper focuses on the operational and environmental impact of <b>curtailing</b> intermittent generation. We construct a stochastic dynamic optimization model that captures the critical components of the system operating cost and analyze how various generation resources should operate with and without <b>curtailing</b> intermittent generation. We find that the system cost reduction per unit of <b>curtailed</b> energy is consistently significant, {{and the presence of}} storage may increase the cost saving per unit of <b>curtailed</b> energy. We also find that <b>curtailing</b> intermittent generation often leads to system emission reductions...|$|R

5|$|Some experts {{also see}} the union {{as a way to}} <b>curtail</b> the loss of Russian {{influence}} in Central Asia.

5|$|Constitutional {{questions}} {{may also be}} referred to the Tribunal when Parliament attempts to circumvent or <b>curtail</b> the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. If the attempt is by way of an ordinary bill, the President can exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to it. It is then open to Cabinet to advise the President {{to refer to the}} Tribunal the question whether the bill in fact circumvents or curtails his discretionary powers. If the bill is determined by the Tribunal not to have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. When Article 5A of the Constitution is brought into force, a similar procedure will apply to attempts to circumvent or <b>curtail</b> the President's discretionary powers through a constitutional amendment. If the Tribunal rules that the proposed amendment does have the effect of restricting the discretionary powers of the President, the Prime Minister is entitled to submit the bill to a national referendum for approval.|$|E

5|$|Palestine {{had been}} a British Mandate {{since the end of}} World War I. Under the terms of the mandate, Great Britain was {{responsible}} for the government and security of the country. It had long been a stated British aim to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine and between 1922 and 1939 over 250,000 Jewish immigrants had arrived in the country. However, Arab resistance and World War II prompted the British to <b>curtail</b> immigration. The time also saw the rise of the Jewish Resistance Movement, which eventually came into conflict with the British authorities.|$|E
5|$|The Old Blockhouse {{appears to}} have been completed, but the Crown's {{resources}} had become badly stretched and the decision was taken at the end of 1552 to <b>curtail</b> further expenditure on the Scilly Isles. Between 1548 and 1552, a total of £3,123 had been spent on improving the fortifications on the islands; a 1579 survey suggested that, with the cost of the garrisons, the project had come to a total of £6,000. Edward's successor, Queen Mary I, intended to establish a garrison of 150 soldiers on the islands, but it is uncertain if these numbers were ever achieved.|$|E
40|$|A <b>curtailed</b> {{numerical}} {{model has been}} developed to assess the tidal hydrodynamics of entrance of a navigational channel in Abu Dhabi coast, United Arab Emirates. The <b>curtailed</b> model is developed using a finite element based numerical scheme, RMA 2 (Donnell et al., 2006). The boundary conditions for the model were extracted from a large scale {{numerical model}} covering entire Abu Dhabi coast, developed using TELEMAC (Hervouet, 2000) modeling software. The hydrodynamic results of the <b>curtailed</b> model are validated with that of large scale model. The comparisons of water levels and current velocities obtained from the two models {{are found to be}} in agreement, demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of the <b>curtailed</b> numerical model. The features of the tidal current pattern {{in the vicinity of the}} entrance of the navigational channel are also discussed. The details of the numerical scheme, model setup and methodology are presented and discussed in this paper...|$|R

5|$|The {{meaning of}} the word law in Article 9(1) has a direct bearing on the scope of the Article. If law is read broadly (for example, as {{incorporating}} customary international law principles), the scope of the fundamental liberties would be wider. It would be narrower if, on the other hand, law is construed narrowly, as the Legislature would be able to <b>curtail</b> such rights through legislation more easily. This could lead to a watering-down of the emphasis on fundamental liberties, as any infringement might be considered legitimate so long as the statute in question was validly enacted.|$|E
5|$|A global {{strategy}} {{to stem the}} crisis was released in 2005 {{in the form of}} the Amphibian Conservation Action Plan. Developed by over eighty leading experts in the field, this call to action details what would be required to <b>curtail</b> amphibian declines and extinctions over the following five years and how much this would cost. The Amphibian Specialist Group of the IUCN is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation. Amphibian Ark is an organization that was formed to implement the ex-situ conservation recommendations of this plan, and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world, encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians. One such project is the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project that built on existing conservation efforts in Panama to create a country-wide response to the threat of chytridiomycosis.|$|E

At the 1880 Republican National Convention in Chicago, he was unanimously chosen to second Roscoe Conkling's nomination of Ulysses S. Grant {{for a third}} term as president. His rousing oratory gained him the attention of prominent leaders of his party. At the 1884 convention, he was instrumental in defeating a motion to <b>curtail</b> Southern states' representation. President Chester A. Arthur chose Bradley to help recover financial damages from postal officials involved in the Star Route Frauds in 1885, but Bradley resigned this responsibility over differences with U.S. Attorney General Benjamin H.
