First, when shaft A is the [...] "primary" [...] and B the [...] "secondary" [...] shaft, the combustion air is added from the top of shaft A, while fuel somewhat below via burner lances. The flame is top-bottom. The hot gases pass downward, cross to shaft B via the so-called [...] "channel" [...] and pass upward to exhaust of shaft B. At same time in both shafts cooling air is added from the bottom to cool the lime and to make exhaust of gases via the bottom of the kiln impossible via maintaining always a positive pressure. The combustion air and cooling air leave the kiln jointly via exhaust on top of shaft B, preheating the stone. The direction of flow is reversed periodically (typically 5-10 times per hour) shaft A and B changing the role of [...] "primary" [...] and [...] "secondary" [...] shaft. The kiln has three zones: preheating zone on the top, burning zone in the middle, and <b>cooling</b> <b>zone</b> close to the bottom. The cycling produces a long burning zone of constant, relatively low temperature (around 950 °C) that is ideal for the production of high quality soft burned reactive lime. With exhaust gas temperatures as low as 120 °C and lime temperature at kiln outlet in 80 °C range the heat loss of the regenerative kiln is minimal, fuel consumption is as low as 3.6 MJ/kg. Due to these features the regenerative kilns are today mainstream technology under conditions of substantial fuel costs. Regenerative kilns are built with 150 to 800 t/day output, 300 to 450 being typical.|$|E

This {{paper has}} studied the {{formation}} mechanism of frame-shaped segregation in 40 Cr wire rod rolled from bloom {{by means of the}} composition measurement, the electron microscopic observation and the energy spectrum analysis method.

The main influence factors are the solidification behavior of liquid steel in columnar-to-equiaxed grain transition zone, the temperature gradient of different solidification regions in bloom, the diffusion rate of the solute and inclusions in transition zone and so on.
