5|$|The <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decree for composers were harsh. Shostakovich {{was among}} those who were {{dismissed}} from the Conservatory altogether. For Shostakovich, the loss of money was perhaps the largest blow. Others still in the Conservatory experienced an atmosphere that was thick with suspicion. No one wanted his work to be understood as formalist, so many resorted to accusing their colleagues of writing or performing anti-proletarian music.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{potential}} clinical <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{presence of an}} axillary arch including confusing the identification and palpation of enlarged or tumorous lymph nodes, the trapping of axillary structures including the axillary nerve and the axillary vein and causing potential problems in axillary surgery or breast reconstruction.

Anton regrets the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atomic bombs, attends the Pugwash Conference, but maintains his belief that it was necessary to end the war and prevented more deaths. He marries Sophie and becomes a professor at Columbia University in New York. With Sophie, he retires to a small town outside of Toronto.|$|E
5|$|As {{the month}} {{came to a}} close, serious {{concerns}} were being raised by some observers regarding Enron's possible manipulation of accepted accounting rules; however, analysis was claimed to be impossible based on the incomplete information provided by Enron. Industry analysts feared that Enron was the new Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund whose bankruptcy in 1998 threatened systemic failure of the international financial markets. Enron's tremendous presence worried some about the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company's possible bankruptcy. Enron executives accepted questions in written form only.|$|E

5|$|Civilians {{who took}} part in the {{evacuation}} suffered the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> military action along Route 7. Most of the civilians who followed the military convoy were either relatives of soldiers or officers in the army, or were government civil servants. Of the estimated 400,000 civilians who initially took part in the march, only a handful actually reached their destinations in the Mekong region. In addition to the casualties inflicted upon them by North Vietnamese artillery, the civilians were also hit by air strikes from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force. As a result of those huge losses, Route 7 became known as the ‘convoy of tears’.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, the {{woodwasp}} {{is fully}} {{dependent on the}} symbionts. Decomposition enables the larvae to unlock the wood by producing white rot. The mycetangia of this and other wasps from the family Siricidae support {{a close relationship with}} saprobiontic fungi. Without the process of decomposition of the host tree and weakening of the infested tree, the development of larvae is arrested. If the tree can recover from the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wasp secretion, it blocks the boreholes with resin, thus killing the larvae.|$|E
5|$|Deciding {{to speak}} with Janos, Raziel orders Moebius to send him further back in time.

Raziel navigates the future era and finds his own {{way back to the}} age of the Sarafan and Janos Audron. There, Janos presents Raziel with the Reaver, a younger version of the physical Soul Reaver blade which will later house a soul-devouring spirit. Suddenly, a group of Sarafan led by Raziel's former, human self launch an ambush, and Janos sacrifices himself. Raziel swears vengeance as Janos dies, and pursues the attackers. He uses the Reaver to kill them and his younger self, renouncing his Sarafan past.|$|E

5|$|Education was {{overwhelmingly}} {{controlled by}} Protestant and Catholic missions, which were {{also responsible for}} providing limited medical and welfare support to the rural Congolese. Food remained unrationed during the war, with only the sales of tires and automobiles restricted by the government. One of the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Congo's economic mobilisation during the war, particularly for the black population, was significant urbanisation. Just 9% of the indigenous population lived in cities in 1938; by 1950, the figure stood at close to 20%. The colonial authorities arrested enemy aliens in the Congo and confiscated their property in 1940.|$|E

He {{realized}} that the nation was about to see the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease, and hoped that this might lead to greater generosity. A week after his run ended, the CTV Television Network organized a nationwide telethon in support of Fox and the Canadian Cancer Society. Supported by Canadian and international celebrities, the five-hour event raised $10.5 million. Among the donations were $1 million each by the governments of British Columbia and Ontario, the former to create a new research institute to be founded in Fox's name, and the latter an endowment given to the Ontario Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation. Donations continued throughout the winter, and by the following April, over $23 million had been raised.|$|E
5|$|Having been raided twice by the Mongols {{within a}} single year, Transylvania felt the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{invasion}} of 12411242 {{for more than two}} decades. The administrative centers of the province, such as Alba Iulia and Cetatea de Baltă, had been destroyed. Due to the severe depopulation, a process of organized colonization commenced that lasted for several decades. For example, a new wave of colonization resulted in the establishment of the Saxon seats of Sighişoara and Mediaş; and the lord of Ilia received, in 1292, royal permission to settle Romanians in the lands he owned.|$|E
