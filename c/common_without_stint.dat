50|$|To {{be sold to}} {{the highest}} bidder… A compact {{freehold}} estate called Mapperley situated in the parish of Basford, within one mile of Nottingham, consisting of two messuage houses, and 18 closes of rich meadow and pasture land adjoining thereto, and lying within a ring fence, containing 88 acres and upwards. There are also 12 acres of arable land to the said estate, as its proportion of break from the Forest. Mapperley is a very pleasant situation, near Sherwood Forest, in a fine sporting country and is entitled to a <b>common</b> right, <b>without</b> <b>stint</b> on the said Forest. To judge from the land awarded {{as a result of}} the Basford Enclosure Act of 1792, ‘Mapperley’, at this time, meant all that area bounded by Redcliffe Road, Mansfield Road, Private Road and Woodborough Road. It is thought that the banker, John Smith, bought the advertised Mapperley estate. He died in 1776, leaving three daughters, one of whom, Mary, married Thomas Wright, and so the estate became the property of the Wright family. In the 1790s Ichabod Wright (1767-1862) built Mapperley Hall at the heart of the estate. In 1873 Ichabod's grandson, Colonel Charles Ichabod Wright began to sell land due south of the Hall and grounds; a plot bounded by Woodborough Road, the upper portion of Magdala Road and Lucknow Drive, intended for six houses.|$|R

60|$|It {{was plain}} all were not practised dancers. Some {{of the young}} men danced with hands waggling at the wrist, and the girls did not know all the changes, but {{laughter}} was hearty and <b>without</b> <b>stint.</b>|$|R

60|$|Teddy cried to {{some one}} below, {{and during the}} next ten minutes two waiters were kept busy {{bringing}} upstairs sandwiches, bologna in generous, thick slices, sauerkraut <b>without</b> <b>stint,</b> potato salad, {{and a variety of}} small cakes plentifully besprinkled with tiny seeds.|$|R

6000|$|BROADBENT [quite reassured]. Of course I am. Our {{guidance}} is {{the important}} thing. We English must place our capacity for government <b>without</b> <b>stint</b> {{at the service of}} nations who are less fortunately endowed in that respect; so as to allow them to develop in perfect freedom to the English level of self-government, you know. You understand me? ...|$|R
60|$|He was young, moreover, yet {{no longer}} callow; comely, yet {{with a strong}} male comeliness; he had a pleasantly {{modulated}} voice, yet one that they had heard swell into a compelling note of command; he had the most joyous, careless laugh in all the world--such a laugh as endears a man to all that hear it--and he indulged it <b>without</b> <b>stint.</b>|$|R
60|$|The last {{argument}} {{had more}} weight with John Forster than the former ones. Once having consented, he took as {{much interest in}} it as did his wife; and dug up the pot in which he stowed away any sums that remained, {{at the end of}} each year, over and above the expenses of the hold; and provided all that was required, <b>without</b> <b>stinting.</b>|$|R
60|$|The other {{requisites}} {{for recovery}} were applied <b>without</b> <b>stint</b> at Prairie Cottage; for, despite the misfortune which had attended {{the cultivation of}} the soil, the Davidsons had a little money, which enabled them to buy provisions and other necessaries, obtainable from the Hudson Bay Company, and thus tide over the disastrous year in greater comfort than fell to the lot {{of many of the}} other settlers.|$|R

Of course that silly affair in foreign parts is not to make any {{difference}} between you two." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{should say}} that the Government, from my observation, is always full of anxiety and liberality toward the sick and wounded. The system in {{operation}} in the permanent hospitals is good, and the money flows <b>without</b> <b>stint.</b> But the details have {{to be left to}} hundreds and thousands of subordinates and officials. Among these, laziness, heartlessness, gouging, and incompetency are more or less prevalent. Still, I consider the permanent hospitals, generally, well conducted.|$|R
60|$|It is the cook's business, also, {{to have an}} eye to {{the general}} {{interests}} of his mess; to see that, when the aggregated allowances of beef, bread, etc., are served out {{by one of the}} master's mates, the mess over which he presides receives its full share, <b>without</b> <b>stint</b> or subtraction. Upon the berth-deck he has a chest, in which to keep his pots, pans, spoons, and small stores of sugar, molasses, tea, and flour.|$|R
50|$|In 1866 the new Church of St Peter was consecrated. Soon {{afterwards}} cholera {{struck the}} East End. Lowder organised Sisters of Mercy {{and others to}} care for the sick and raised funds for a tented hospital. The Priests and Sisters took great risks and worked <b>without</b> <b>stint</b> for the people of Wapping. At the end of the cholera people were calling Lowder, ‘the Father’ because he seemed like the father of the whole community.|$|R
50|$|Men lived like gods without sorrow of heart, {{remote and}} free from toil and grief: miserable age rested not on them; but with {{legs and arms}} never failing they made merry with feasting {{beyond the reach of}} all devils. When they died, it was as though they were {{overcome}} with sleep, and they had all good things; for the fruitful earth unforced bare them fruit abundantly and <b>without</b> <b>stint.</b> They dwelt in ease and peace.|$|R
6000|$|But now {{the combat}} had lasted {{half an hour}} <b>without</b> <b>stint</b> or rest, until the warriors were so {{exhausted}} with the burden of their armor, the loss of blood, the shock of blows, and their own furious exertions, that they could scarce totter or raise their weapons. There must be a pause if the combat was to have any decisive end. [...] "Cessez! Cessez! Retirez!" [...] cried the heralds, as they spurred their horses between the exhausted men.|$|R
60|$|But I will by {{no means}} insist upon my conjecture. What is certain {{is that for the}} present my studies, without method and <b>without</b> <b>stint,</b> began to tell upon my health, and that my nerves gave way in all manner of hypochondriacal fears. These finally {{resolved}} themselves into one, incessant, inexorable, which I could escape only through bodily fatigue, or through some absorbing interest that took me out of myself altogether and filled my morbid mind with the images of another's creation.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the same}} day, a {{correspondent}} {{wrote to the}} Times. [...] "The untimely death of Miss Rosa Bassett is a severe loss, not only to London Education, but to teachers {{in all parts of}} the world, to whom her advice and aid were given <b>without</b> <b>stint.</b> She will be gratefully remembered by thousands of teachers to whom during the last five years she had elucidated and explained the working of the Dalton Plan, with which hundreds of English schools have since successfully experimented." ...|$|R
60|$|In a noisy, flaring street, a thin-clad woman passed her, {{carrying}} a netted bag showing two loaves. In a flash, {{it came to}} her what it must mean to the poor; this daily bread that in comfortable homes had come to be regarded as a thing like water; not to be considered, to be used <b>without</b> <b>stint,</b> wasted, thrown about. Borne by those feeble, knotted hands, Joan saw it revealed as something holy: hallowed by labour; sanctified by suffering, by sacrifice; worshipped with fear and prayer.|$|R
6000|$|This was {{the time}} when Giglio began his tricks with Prince Bulbo, plying that young gentleman with port, sherry, madeira, champagne, marsala, cherry-brandy, and pale ale, of all of which Master Bulbo drank <b>without</b> <b>stint.</b> But in plying his guest, Giglio was obliged to drink himself, and, I am sorry to say, took more than was good for him, so that the young men were very noisy, rude, and foolish when they joined the ladies after dinner; and dearly did they pay for that imprudence, as now, my darlings, you shall hear! ...|$|R
60|$|Presently {{they looked}} at each other. Violet had a brown {{birthmark}} on her neck as large as a silver half-dollar. William fixed his eyes upon it. William Pry had inordinately bowed legs. Violet allowed her gaze to linger unswervingly upon them. Face to face they stood thus for moments, each staring at the other. Etiquette would not allow them to speak; but in the Caoutchouc City it is permitted to gaze <b>without</b> <b>stint</b> at the trees in the parks and at the physical blemishes of a fellow creature.|$|R
5000|$|Born about 1628, William Winstanley was {{the second}} son of William Winstanley of Quendon, Essex, (d. 1687) by his wife Elizabeth. Henry Winstanley was his nephew. William {{was sworn in as}} a freeman of Saffron Walden on 21 April 1649. He was for a time a barber in London (Wood, Athenae Oxon. ed. Bliss, iv. 763), but he soon relinquished the razor for the pen. [...] "The scissors, however, he retained, for he {{borrowed}} <b>without</b> <b>stint,</b> and <b>without</b> acknowledgement also, from his predecessors", Much of his literary work commemorates his connection with Essex.|$|R
6000|$|... "But Moosu complained. 'O master,' he said, 'we {{have laid}} by great wealth in {{molasses}} and sugar and flour, but our shack is yet mean, our clothes thin, and our sleeping furs mangy.

60|$|We drank.

In the meantime, Monsieur Maillard and myself, with some bottles of Sauterne and Vougeot between us, continued our conversation {{at the top of}} the voice.

5000|$|A {{reviewer}} in Mount Gambier's Border Watch newspaper saw a {{new direction}} for the poet emerging, finding that the poem [...] "...is conceived {{in a spirit of}} singular power. It is an absolute study of a phase of Australian forest life. It is a virtual word-photograph, drawn by a genuine son of Apollo. It is characterised by both genius and truth, and had not Kendall died shortly after he discovered his adaptability for this style of composition, we should doubtless have had some superlative studies of a peculiarly Australian type.

The disposition of the cold and cautious William had little in common with the fierce and turbulent Mordaunt.
