25|$|The modern {{elements}} of resuscitation for sudden cardiac arrest are cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR in turn consists of mouth-to-mouth ventilation and <b>chest</b> <b>compression),</b> defibrillation and {{emergency medical services}} (the means to bring these techniques to the patient quickly).|$|E
25|$|The formalised {{system of}} <b>chest</b> <b>compression</b> {{was really an}} {{accidental}} discovery made in 1958 by William Bennett Kouwenhoven, Guy Knickerbocker, and James Jude at Johns Hopkins University. They were studying defibrillation in dogs when they noticed that by forcefully applying the paddles to the chest of the dog, they could achieve a pulse in the femoral artery. Further meticulous experimentation involving dogs answered such basic questions as how fast to press, where to press, and how deep to press. This information gave them the belief that they were ready for human trials.|$|E
25|$|Statements {{described}} Murray {{as someone}} using a non-standard CPR technique on Jackson. During {{the tape of}} the emergency call, released on June 26 one day after Jackson's death, the doctor was described as administering CPR on a bed, not on a hard surface such as a floor, which would be standard practice. The doctor's attorney said that Murray placed one hand underneath Jackson and used the other hand for <b>chest</b> <b>compression,</b> where the standard practice is to use both hands for compression. A Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) spokesperson said the 911 call came in at 12:21:04p.m. PDT (19:21:04UTC). Paramedics reached Jackson at 12:26p.m. and found that he still was not breathing.|$|E
40|$|Background. Recent {{guidelines}} for infant cardiopulmonary resuscitation emphasize that all rescuers should minimize interruption of <b>chest</b> <b>compressions,</b> even for endotracheal intubation. We compared {{the utility of}} the Pentax-AWS Airwayscope (AWS) with the Glidescope (GS) during <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> on an infant manikin. Methods. Twenty-four anesthesiologists with more than two years of experience performed tracheal intubation on an infant manikin using the AWS and GS, with or without <b>chest</b> <b>compressions.</b> Results. In GS trials, none of the participants failed without compressions, while three failed with compressions. In AWS trials, all participants succeeded regardless of <b>chest</b> <b>compressions.</b> Intubation time was significantly longer with <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> with the GS (P< 0. 05), but not with the AWS. Difficulty of operation on a visual analog scale (VAS) for laryngoscopy did not increase significantly with <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> with either the GS or the AWS, while the VAS for tube passage through the glottis increased with compressions with the GS, but not with the AWS. Conclusion. We conclude that in infant simulations managed by anesthesiologists, the AWS performed better than the GS for endotracheal intubation with <b>chest</b> <b>compressions...</b>|$|R
50|$|Mouth-to-mouth {{resuscitation}} was {{combined with}} <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> {{based on the}} assumption that active ventilation is necessary to keep circulating blood oxygenated, and the combination was accepted without comparing its effectiveness with <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> alone. However, research over the past decade has shown that assumption to be in error, resulting in the AHA's acknowledgment of the effectiveness of <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> alone (see Compression only in this article).|$|R

25|$|Various {{methods are}} used to achieve the level of oxygen {{depletion}} needed, such as a hanging, suffocation with a plastic bag over the head, self-strangulation such as with a ligature, gas or volatile solvents, <b>chest</b> <b>compression,</b> {{or some combination of}} these. Sometimes, complicated devices {{are used to}} produce the desired effects. The practice can be dangerous even if performed with care and has resulted in a significant number of accidental deaths. Uva (1995) writes “Estimates of the mortality rate of autoerotic asphyxia range from 250 to 1000 deaths per year in the United States.” Cases have also been reported in Scandinavia and Germany. Autoerotic asphyxiation may often be mistaken for suicide, which is a major cause of death in teenagers.|$|E
25|$|CPR has {{continued}} to advance, with recent developments including an emphasis on constant, rapid heart stimulation, without respiration. Studies have shown that people who had rapid, constant hands-only <b>chest</b> <b>compression</b> 22% more likely to survive than those receiving conventional, CPR that included breathing. What's more, because {{people tend to be}} reluctant to do mouth-to-mouth, chest-only CPR nearly doubles the chances of survival overall, by increasing the odds of receiving CPR in the first place. An analysis of 3,700 cardiac arrests published Friday in the journal Lancet found that hands-only CPR saved 22% more lives than the conventional method. All told, the switch could save up to 3,000 additional lives a year in the USA and 5,000 to 10,000 in North America and Europe, says lead author Peter Nagele of Washington University in St. Louis.|$|E
2500|$|The formal {{connection}} of <b>chest</b> <b>compression</b> with mouth-to-mouth ventilation to create CPR {{as it is}} practiced today occurred when Safar, Jude, and Kouwenhoven presented their findings at the annual Maryland Medical Society meeting on September 16, 1960 in Ocean City. In the opening remarks the moderator said, [...] "Our purpose today is to bring to you, then, this new idea." [...] It was so new that it was still without a name. The moderator stated that the two techniques [...] "cannot be considered any longer as separate units, but as parts of a whole and complete approach to resuscitation". In his remarks Safar {{stressed the importance of}} combining ventilation and circulation. He presented convincing data that <b>chest</b> <b>compression</b> alone did not provide effective ventilation; mouth-to-mouth respiration had {{to be part of the}} equation.|$|E
40|$|Chest {{compressions}} in {{cardiopulmonary resuscitation}} are {{of utmost importance}} although not without a risk. Many injuries are described but the incidence of these is hard to define due to methodological differences. It is strenuous to perform <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> and therefore mechanical <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> have been looked upon with interest. This thesis presents new insights on the panorama and incidence of injuries in modern CPR and a comparison of safety and efficacy between manual <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> and mechanical <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> with the LUCAS™ device. We also evaluated if computed tomography could be an aid in the detection of these injuries. Two pilot trials were conducted and one presented no difference in early survival with 26 % and 31 % having return of spontaneous circulation when comparing manual <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> with the LUCAS device in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The other revealed no difference in autopsy-detected injuries. A third multicentre autopsy trial revealed that in patients treated with manual <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> 78. 3 % {{had at least one}} injury and 63. 9 % had at least one rib fracture. The corresponding numbers for patients treated with the LUCAS device was 92. 8 % (p = 0. 002) and 77. 7 % (p= 0. 022). Sternal fractures occurred in 54. 2 % and in 58. 3 % of the cases treated with manual <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> and the LUCAS device respectively (p = 0. 556). The median number of rib fractures was 7 in the group receiving manual <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> and 6 in the group receiving <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> with the LUCAS device. In 31 cases a computed tomography was conducted prior to autopsy and we found a very strong correlation in the discrimination of patients with or without rib fractures (kappa= 0. 83). Mean difference between the two methods in detecting rib fractures was 0. 16. The detection of other injuries did not have a strong correlation. In conclusion there is no difference in early survival between the two methods and mechanical <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> adds 14 - 15 % more patients with rib fractures but the amount of rib fractures, sternal fractures and other injuries is equal. CT can aid but not replace autopsies in the detection of these injuries...|$|R
40|$|Some {{clinical}} {{studies have suggested}} that <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> before defibrillation improve survival in cardiac arrest because of prolonged ventricular fibrillation (VF; ie, within the circulatory phase). Animal data have also supported this conclusion, and we have previously demonstrated that preshock <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> increase the VF median frequency and improve the likelihood of a return of spontaneous circulation in normal swine. We hypothesized that <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> before defibrillation in a swine model of acute myocardial ischemia would also increase VF median frequency and improve resuscitation outcome...|$|R
50|$|CPR {{involves}} <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> {{for adults}} between 5 cm and 6 cm deep {{and at a}} rate of at least 100 to 120 per minute. The rescuer may also provide artificial ventilation by either exhaling air into the subject's mouth or nose (mouth-to-mouth resuscitation) or using a device that pushes air into the subject's lungs (mechanical ventilation). Current recommendations place emphasis on early and high-quality <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> over artificial ventilation; a simplified CPR method involving <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> only is recommended for untrained rescuers. In children, however, only doing compressions may result in worse outcomes.|$|R
2500|$|In 1960 {{the three}} {{investigators}} reported their findings on 20 cases of in-hospital cardiac arrest in JAMA. Fourteen of the 20 patients (70%) survived and were {{discharged from the}} hospital. Many of the patients were in cardiac arrest {{as a result of}} anaesthesia. Three patients were documented to be in ventricular fibrillation. The duration of <b>chest</b> <b>compression</b> varied from less than 1minute to 65minutes. The JAMA article was very straightforward: <b>chest</b> <b>compression</b> buys time until the external defibrillator arrives on the scene. As the authors write in the article, [...] "Anyone, anywhere, can now initiate cardiac resuscitative procedures. All that is needed is two hands". However, respiration received relatively little attention in the 1960 JAMA article. Many of the patients had been intubated and thus the need for mouth-to-mouth ventilation was not necessary. It was not long however, before this newly discovered technique was used in conjunction with the longer held techniques of artificial respiration.|$|E
2500|$|The {{success in}} the {{hospital}} wards made them believe {{success in the}} community would be possible.

50|$|For bystanders, CPR which {{involves}} only <b>chest</b> <b>compressions</b> results in better outcomes {{as compared to}} standard CPR {{for those who have}} gone into cardiac arrest due to heart issues.

It is unclear if a few minutes of CPR before defibrillation results in different outcomes than immediate defibrillation. If cardiac arrest occurs after 20 weeks of pregnancy someone should pull or push the uterus to the left during CPR.
