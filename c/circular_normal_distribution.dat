2500|$|In {{probability}} theory and directional statistics, the von Mises distribution (also {{known as the}} <b>circular</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> or Tikhonov distribution) is a continuous probability distribution on the circle. It is a close approximation to the wrapped normal distribution, which is the circular analogue of the normal distribution. A freely diffusing angle [...] on a circle is a wrapped normally distributed random variable with an unwrapped variance that grows linearly in time. On the other hand, the von Mises distribution is the stationary distribution of a drift and diffusion process on the circle in a harmonic potential, i.e. with a preferred orientation. The von Mises distribution is the maximum entropy distribution for circular data when the real and imaginary parts of the first circular moment are specified. The von Mises distribution is a special case of the von Mises–Fisher distribution on the N-dimensional sphere.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{concept of}} CEP {{was based on}} a <b>circular</b> bivariate <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> (CBN) with CEP as a parameter of the CBN just as μ and σ are parameters of the <b>normal</b> <b>distribution.</b> Munitions with this distribution behavior tend to cluster around the mean impact point, with most reasonably close, progressively fewer and fewer further away, and very few at long distance. That is, if CEP is n meters, 50% of rounds land within n meters of the mean impact, 43% between n and 2n, and 7% between 2n and 3n meters, and the proportion of rounds that land farther than three times the CEP from the mean is approximately 0.32%.|$|R
40|$|AbstractUnderstanding the {{orientation}} distribution of structural discontinuities using the limited information afforded by their trace in outcrop has considerable application, with such analysis often providing {{the basis for}} geological modelling. However, eigen analysis of 3 D structural lineaments mapped at decimetre to regional scales indicates that discontinuity best fit plane estimates from such datasets tend to be unreliable. Here, the relationship between digitised lineament vertex geometry (coplanarity/collinearity) and the reliability of their estimated best fitting plane is investigated using Monte Carlo experiments. Lineaments are modelled as the intersection curve between two orthonormally oriented fractional Brownian surfaces representing the outcrop and discontinuity plane. Commensurate to increasing lineament vertex collinearity (K), systematic decay in estimated pole vector precision is observed from these experiments. Pole vector distributions are circumferentially constrained around the axis of rotation set by the end nodes of the synthetic lineaments, reducing the rotational degrees of freedom of the vertex set from three to one. Vectors on the unit circle formed perpendicular to this arbitrary axis of rotation conform to von Mises (<b>circular</b> <b>normal)</b> <b>distributions</b> tending towards uniform at extreme values of K. This latter observation suggests that whilst intrinsically unreliable, confidence limits can be placed upon orientation estimates from 3 D structural lineaments digitised from remotely sensed data. A probabilistic framework is introduced which draws upon the statistical constraints obtained from our experiments to provide robust best fit plane estimates from digitised 3 D structural lineaments...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{estimation}} of the thermal diffusivity from perturbative experiments in fusion plasmas is discussed. The measurements used to estimate the thermal diffusivity suffer from stochastic noise. Accurate estimation of the thermal diffusivity should take this into account. It will be shown that formulas {{found in the literature}} often result in a thermal diffusivity that has a bias (a difference between the estimated value and the actual value that remains even if more measurements are added) or have an unnecessarily large uncertainty. This will be shown by modeling a plasma using only diffusion as heat transport mechanism and measurement noise based on ASDEX Upgrade measurements. The Fourier coefficients of a temperature perturbation will exhibit noise from the <b>circular</b> complex <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> (CCND). Based on Fourier coefficients distributed according to a CCND, it is shown that the resulting probability density function of the thermal diffusivity is an inverse non-central chi-squared distribution. The thermal diffusivity that is found by sampling this distribution will always be biased, and averaging of multiple estimated diffusivities will not necessarily improve {{the estimation}}. Confidence bounds are constructed to illustrate the uncertainty in the diffusivity using several formulas that are equivalent in the noiseless case. Finally, a different method of averaging, that reduces the uncertainty significantly, is suggested. The methodology is also extended to the case where damping is included, and it is explained how to include the cylindrical geometry...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} a simple fully Bayesian {{analysis}} of the change-point problem for the directional data in the parametric framework with von Mises or <b>circular</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> as the underlying distribution. We first discuss the problem of detecting change in the mean direction of the <b>circular</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> using a latent variable approach when the concentration parameter is unknown. Then, a simpler approach, beginning with proper priors for all the unknown parameters - the sampling importance resampling technique - is used to obtain the posterior marginal distribution of the change-point. The method is illustrated using the wind data [E. P. Weijers, A. Van Delden, H. F. Vugts and A. G. C. A. Meesters, The composite horizontal wind field within convective structures of the atmospheric surface layer, J. Atmos. Sci. 52 (1995. 3866 - 3878].

40|$|The {{family of}} Symmetric Wrapped Stable (SWS) {{distributions}} can be widely used for modelling circular data. Mixtures of Circular Uniform (CU) {{with the former}} also have applications as a larger family of circular distributions to incorporate possible outliers. Restricting ourselves to such a mixture, we derive the locally most powerful invariant (LMPI) test for the hypothesis of isotropy or randomness of directions-expressed {{in terms of the}} null value of the mixing proportion, p, in the model. Global monotonicity of the power function of the test is established. The test is also consistent. Power values of the test for some selected parameter combinations, obtained through simulation reveal quite encouraging performances even for moderate sample sizes. The P 3 approach (SenGupta, 1991; Pal & SenGupta, 2000) for unknown p and rho and the non-regular case of unknown a, the index parameter, are also discussed. A real-life example is presented to illustrate the inadequacy of the <b>circular</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> as a circular model. This example is also used to demonstrate the applications of the LMPI test, optimal P 3 test and a Daviesmotivated test (Davies, 1977, 1987). Finally, a goodness-of-fit test performed on the data establishes the plausibility of the above SWS-CU mixture model for real-life problems encountered in practical situations. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} on {{circular}} statistics {{that is also}} known as directional statistics. Directional statistics is a branch of statistics which deal with the data in angle form in which the method of analysis is different from linear data. For example, the distribution analogues to the normal distribution in linear data is known as <b>circular</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distribution.</b> This study comprises of four parts. The first part of the study focuses on the efficient approximation for the concentration parameter in von Mises distribution. Here, a new method of approximating the concentration parameter is proposed, and the performance of the proposed method is studied via simulation study. The second part of the study is on the confidence intervals (CI) for the concentration parameter in von Mises distribution. Several methods in constructing the CI for the concentration parameter are proposed including CI based on circular population, CI based on the asymptotic distribution of ˆ , CI based on the distribution of 휃 and 푅 and also CI based on bootstrap-t method. All proposed methods are validated via simulation study and the performance indicator such as an expected length and its coverage probability are evaluated. The third part of the study is on the derivation of the circular distance for circular data. From this derivation, we construct the CI for the concentration parameter. Three different methods will be considered in proposing the new CI including mean, median and percentile. The simulation studies carried out to assess the performance of each proposed method. The final part of this study is an analysis of missing values for circular variables. Missing values is a common problem that occurs in data collection. By ignoring the existence of missing values, leads to the biasness and lack of efficiency of a statistics. In this study, three imputation methods are considered namely expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and data augmentation (DA) algorithm. All proposed methods are compared to the conventional methods. The analyses are conducted by doing the simulation studies by varying the value of the concentration parameter. All the proposed methods from this study are illustrated using the real data consisting of data in angle form found in the literature...|$|E
