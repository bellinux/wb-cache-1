5|$|The {{core of the}} I Ching is a Western Zhou divination text {{called the}} Changes of Zhou (周易 Zhōu yì). Various modern {{scholars}} suggest dates ranging between the 10th and 4th centuries BC for the assembly of the text in approximately its <b>current</b> <b>form.</b> Based on {{a comparison of the}} language of the Zhou yi with dated bronze inscriptions, the American sinologist Edward Shaughnessy dated its compilation in its <b>current</b> <b>form</b> to {{the early decades of the}} reign of King Xuan of Zhou, in the last quarter of the 9th century BC. A copy of the text in the Shanghai Museum corpus of bamboo and wooden slips (recovered in 1994) shows that the Zhou yi was used throughout all levels of Chinese society in its <b>current</b> <b>form</b> by 300 BC, but still contained small variations as late as the Warring States period. It is possible that other divination systems existed at this time; the Rites of Zhou name two other such systems, the Lianshan and the Guizang.|$|E
5|$|Archimedes' Book of Lemmas or Liber Assumptorum is a {{treatise}} with fifteen propositions on {{the nature}} of circles. The earliest known copy of the text is in Arabic. The scholars T. L. Heath and Marshall Clagett argued that it cannot have been written by Archimedes in its <b>current</b> <b>form,</b> since it quotes Archimedes, suggesting modification by another author. The Lemmas may be based on an earlier work by Archimedes that is now lost.|$|E

5|$|Baden-Powell House, colloquially {{known as}} B-P House, is a Scouting hostel and conference centre in South Kensington, London, {{which was built}} {{as a tribute to}} Lord Baden-Powell, the founder of Scouting.

5|$|Circumstantial {{evidence}} supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior. Newborns, not even hours after birth, {{have been found}} to display a preparedness for social interaction. This preparedness is expressed in ways such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any <b>current</b> <b>form</b> of socialization or social construction. Rather, newborns most likely inherit to some extent social behavior and identity through genetics.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, the {{government}} brought the UERL and the Metropolitan Railway {{together as a}} single organisation, the London Passenger Transport Board. The London Underground has since passed {{through a series of}} administrations, expanding further by the construction of new extensions and through the acquisition of existing main line routes, culminating in its <b>current</b> <b>form</b> as part of Transport for London, the capital's current transport administration, controlled by the Greater London Authority.|$|E

5|$|John de Breton (died c. 12 May 1275) was {{a medieval}} Bishop of Hereford. He {{served as a}} royal justice and sheriff before being {{nominated}} to Hereford.

5|$|M-216 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan {{that serves as a}} connector route between M-40 at Marcellus and US Highway131 (US131). The highway runs through a rural area of the southwestern part of the state. It {{has been a part of}} the highway system since 1935; the <b>current</b> <b>form</b> of the roadway was finalized in 1939. Between 2,400 and 3,900vehicles use the highway each day on average.|$|E
5|$|On August 24–25, 1814, in a raid {{known as}} the Burning of Washington, British forces invaded the capital during the War of 1812. The Capitol, Treasury, and White House were burned and gutted during the attack. Most {{government}} buildings were repaired quickly; however, the Capitol was largely under construction {{at the time and}} was not completed in its <b>current</b> <b>form</b> until 1868.|$|E
40|$|There is a {{well-established}} critique of <b>current</b> <b>forms</b> of electronic information systems (IS) {{in social work}} organisations and attention is now turning to their redesign for the future. In this article we go beyond critiques that have established how this occurred to explore {{one of the reasons}} why <b>current</b> <b>forms</b> of IS have been observed to undermine frontline practice. In the same way that technological artefacts are observed to mediate human action by ‘configuring the user’, IS have also been developed, or configured, according to ideas about how things should be done, known as ‘embodied structures’. In this article, examples of IS functionality are drawn upon to demonstrate how the logics of New Public Management (NPM) have been embodied in <b>current</b> <b>forms</b> of IS. It is argued that the logics of NPM must be challenged if new forms of IS are to be developed that amplify the ability of practitioners...|$|R

5|$|The Broadway Hollywood Building {{was built}} as a {{department}} store, but has been refurbished as both commercial office space and as its <b>current</b> <b>form</b> of residential condominiums. For several decades it hosted The Broadway. The building had an annex built to the west in 1939 and is also associated with the address 6316 Hollywood Boulevard. As a residential building, the building's units have had numerous famous owners.|$|E
5|$|The house {{started as}} a small {{farmhouse}} in 1630 but was enlarged into its <b>current</b> <b>form</b> in the 18th century. The house was {{the property of the}} Napper family for centuries.

It was originally laid out by Phyllis Reiss and developed by Penelope Hobhouse.|$|E

5|$|The {{outermost}} ring, Adams, contains five prominent arcs now named Courage, Liberté, Egalité1, Egalité2 and Fraternité (Courage, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity). The {{existence of}} arcs {{was difficult to}} explain because the laws of motion would predict that arcs would spread out into a uniform ring over short timescales. Astronomers now estimate that the arcs are corralled into their <b>current</b> <b>form</b> by the gravitational effects of Galatea, a moon just inward from the ring.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} that stands {{on what is}} known locally as the Canal Bank, called Cromwell's Castle, primarily derives its <b>current</b> <b>form</b> from the Napoleonic Wars.

5|$|Although {{visually}} {{similar to}} Rare's family-oriented Nintendo 64 platform games Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64, Conker's Bad Fur Day {{was designed for}} mature audiences and features graphic violence, alcohol and tobacco use, profanity, vulgar humor and pop culture references. It was developed {{over the course of}} four years and was originally intended for a family audience, but was ultimately retooled into its <b>current</b> <b>form</b> because previews were criticised for being both too cute and similar to Rare's earlier platform games.|$|E
5|$|Appearing on a {{document}} of May 28, 1239, the oldest seal of Munich has {{a picture of}} a monk wearing an open hood. While all seal impressions show the monk with the book in one hand and three outstretched fingers in the other, the monk has varied slightly, appearing in profile, then later full-faced and bare-headed. By the 19th century the figure was portrayed as youthful and became known as the Münchner Kindl or Munich Child. The coat of arms in its <b>current</b> <b>form</b> was created in 1957 and is still an important symbol of the Bavarian state capital.|$|E
5|$|CR492 was {{previously}} {{known as the}} Marquette–Negaunee Road before it was made {{a part of the}} State Trunkline Highway System. It was originally designated as a part of M-15 as early as 1917. The superintendent of the Marquette County Road Commission, Kenneth Ingalls Sawyer, painted the first rural highway centerline on the roadway on Dead Man's Curve. The highway was later a part of M-28 before being transferred back to county control. The highway assumed its <b>current</b> <b>form</b> by 2001. The eastern section along Brookton Road in Marquette Township was redesignated as a county secondary highway when a new connection to US41/M-28 was opened, and the designation was extended along Wright Street on the west and north sides of Marquette.|$|E
