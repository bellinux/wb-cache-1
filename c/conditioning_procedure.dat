The results provide evidence for EC as an associative process and also provide some insight into the possible conditioning parameters that might successfully generate EC...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{evidence}} suggests that various discrete nuclei within the amygdala complex are critically involved in the assignment of emotional significance or value to events through associative learning. Much of this evidence comes from aversive <b>conditioning</b> <b>procedures.</b> For example, lesions of either basolateral amygdala (ABL) or the central nucleus (CN) interfere with the acquisition or expression of conditioned fear. The present study {{examined the effects of}} selective neurotoxic lesions of either ABL or CN on the acquisition of positive incentive value by a conditioned stimulus (CS) with two appetitive Pavlovian <b>conditioning</b> <b>procedures.</b> In second-order <b>conditioning</b> experiments, rats first received light–food pairings intended to endow the light with reinforcing power.

50|$|Backward {{conditioning}} {{occurs when}} a CS immediately follows a US. Unlike the usual <b>conditioning</b> <b>procedure,</b> in which the CS precedes the US, the conditioned response given to the CS tends to be inhibitory. This presumably happens because the CS serves as a signal that the US has ended, {{rather than as a}} signal that the US is about to appear. For example, a puff of air directed at a person's eye could be followed by the sound of a buzzer.|$|E

50|$|Autoshaping (sometimes called sign tracking) is any of {{a variety}} of {{experimental}} procedures used to study classical conditioning. In autoshaping, in contrast to shaping, the reward comes irrespective of the behavior of the animal. In its simplest form, autoshaping is very similar to Pavlov's salivary <b>conditioning</b> <b>procedure</b> using dogs. In Pavlov's best-known procedure, a short audible tone reliably preceded the presentation of food to dogs. The dogs naturally, unconditionally, salivated (unconditioned response) to the food (unconditioned stimulus) given to them, but through learning, conditionally, came to salivate (conditioned response) to the tone (conditioned stimulus) that predicted food. In auto-shaping, a light is reliably turned on shortly before animals are given food. The animals naturally, unconditionally, display consummatory reactions to the food given them, but through learning, conditionally, came to perform those same consummatory actions directed at the conditioned stimulus that predicts food.|$|E
5000|$|Although operant {{conditioning}} plays the largest role {{in discussions of}} behavioral mechanisms, classical conditioning (or Pavlovian conditioning or respondent conditioning) {{is also an important}} behavior-analytic process that need not refer to mental or other internal processes. Pavlov's experiments with dogs provide the most familiar example of the classical <b>conditioning</b> <b>procedure.</b> In simple conditioning, the dog was presented with a stimulus such as a light or a sound, and then food was placed in the dog's mouth. After a few repetitions of this sequence, the light or sound by itself caused the dog to salivate. [...] Although Pavlov proposed some tentative physiological processes that might be involved in classical conditioning, these have not been confirmed. The idea of classical conditioning helped behaviorist John Watson discover the key mechanism behind how humans acquire the behaviors that they do, which was to find a natural reflex that produces the response being considered.|$|E
50|$|Early {{on in the}} Tbilisi period (1919-1941), Beritashvili grew {{dissatisfied}} with the unnatural restraints that the <b>conditioning</b> <b>procedure</b> imposes on the animal, {{and went on to}} develop a paradigm of “free behavior” in most of his subsequent work on goal-directed behavior. Among his most important decisions, he abandoned the Pavlov/Bekhterev paradigm for the study of conditional reflexes. He was highly critical of this approach, {{as well as of the}} behaviorism, prevalent in North America at that time. Instead, he was attracted by the common knowledge of the ability of dogs to find their way to food, and the brief experiments of Wolfgang Köhler (1887-1967) testing this ability in dogs as well as in chimpanzees. However, unsatisfied with Köhler’s few observations, as well as with Pavlov’s explanation of them as examples of conditional reflexes, Beritashvili committed himself to testing behavior in freely moving animals—a method that was inherently natural and versatile. The prototypical example of such learning is that of a hungry dog, brought for the first time into a particular room and fed there at a specific place. Following such a single exposure, the animal would run directly to that place of food immediately upon entering that same room, even if this occurred several months later.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{study in}} 2008, a group of nautiluses (N. pompilius) were given food as a bright blue light flashed until they began to {{associate}} the light with food, extending their tentacles every time the blue light was flashed. The blue light was again flashed without the food 3 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours later. The nautiluses continued to respond excitedly to the blue light for up to 30 minutes after the experiment. An hour later they showed no reaction to the blue light. However, between 6 and 12 hours after the training, they again responded to the blue light, but more tentatively. The researchers concluded that nautiluses had memory capabilities similar to the [...] "short-term" [...] and [...] "long-term memories" [...] of the more advanced cephalopods, despite having different brain structures. However the long-term memory capability of nautiluses was much shorter than that of other cephalopods. The nautiluses completely forgot the earlier training 24 hours later, in contrast to octopuses, for example, which can remember conditioning for weeks afterwards. However, this may be simply {{the result of the}} <b>conditioning</b> <b>procedure</b> being suboptimal for sustaining long-term memories in nautiluses.

40|$|OBJECTIVE : Associative {{learning}} {{has been proposed}} as a mechanism behind the persistence of pain after tissue healing. The simultaneous occurrence of nociceptive and non-nociceptive input during acute injury mimics the pairings thought to drive classical conditioning effects. However, empirical evidence for classically conditioned allodynia is lacking. We aimed to manipulate pain thresholds with a classical <b>conditioning</b> <b>procedure</b> that used non-nociceptive somatosensory stimuli as conditioned stimuli (CS) and nociceptive stimuli as unconditioned stimuli. We also explored the influence of gender, depression, anxiety, negative affect, and pain catastrophizing on the main manipulation. DESIGN : Thirty-four healthy humans participated in a differential classical <b>conditioning</b> <b>procedure</b> that used vibrotactile stimulations at two different locations as CS. In an acquisition phase, CS+[*]was paired with painful thermal stimulation, and CS- with nonpainful thermal stimulation. Heat pain threshold was assessed during paired heat-CS trials before and after acquisition. A 2 (time: 1 and 2) x 2 (condition: CS+[*]and CS-) repeated-measures analysis of variance compared pain thresholds before and after acquisition. Exploratory analyses explored the influence of gender, depression, anxiety, negative affect, and pain catastrophizing. Postexperiment questions investigated participants' awareness of the contingencies employed. RESULTS : The classical <b>conditioning</b> <b>procedure</b> did not alter pain thresholds. Exploratory analyses did not reveal any influence of individual differences. Thirty of the 34 participants were unaware of the contingencies between stimuli.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{relationships}} among classical conditioning, expectancy, and fear in placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia. A total of 42 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to three groups: placebo, nocebo, and control. They received 96 electrical stimuli, preceded by either orange or blue lights. A hidden <b>conditioning</b> <b>procedure,</b> in which participants were not informed about the meaning of coloured lights, was performed in the placebo and nocebo groups. Light of one colour was paired with pain stimuli of moderate intensity (control stimuli), and light of the other colour was paired with either nonpainful stimuli (in the placebo group) or painful stimuli of high intensity (in the nocebo group). In the control group, both colour lights were followed by control stimuli of moderate intensity without any <b>conditioning</b> <b>procedure.</b> Participants rated pain intensity, expectancy of pain intensity, and fear. In the testing phase, when both of the coloured lights were followed by identical moderate pain stimuli, we found a significant analgesic effect in the placebo group, and a significant hyperalgesic effect in the nocebo group. Neither expectancy nor fear ratings predicted placebo analgesia or nocebo hyperalgesia. It appears that a hidden <b>conditioning</b> <b>procedure,</b> without any explicit verbal suggestions, elicits placebo and nocebo effects, however we found no evidence that these effects are predicted by either expectancy or fear.
