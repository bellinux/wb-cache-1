40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use the}} matrix method to {{calculate}} spectacle magnification (SM) and relative spectacle magnification (RSM) using pupil magnification for myopic eyes <b>corrected</b> with contact lenses (CLs), and intraocular lenses (IOLs). For myopic eyes <b>corrected</b> with contact lenses, the calculation {{is very similar to}} the one done for myopic eyes <b>corrected</b> with ophthalmic lenses (OLs) since both OLs and CLs are external <b>correcting</b> systems. For myopic eyes <b>corrected</b> with intraocular lenses, the calculation is different from the ones carried out for myopic eyes with external <b>correcting</b> systems. In this paper we show the differences that exist between the matrix calculations for these two <b>correcting</b> systems, external and internal. The magnifications are calculated for specific myopic eyes <b>corrected</b> with CLs and IOLs. By comparing the results obtained with three correction types, namely, OLs, CLs and IOLs, {{we will be able to}} choose the best correction system for each case...|$|R

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{investigation of the}} over-all performance of a simply constructed, short-life, turbojet engine was conducted. The unit was operated at a pressure altitude of 15, 000 feet for ram-pressure ratios of 1. 2 t o 1. 8. The <b>corrected</b> engine speed was varied from the minimum for good combustion to about 17, 000 rpm, which is approximately 75 percent of rated speed. The performance is given by generalized parameters that permit the calculation of performance at any altitude. The <b>corrected</b> net thrust of the turbojet engine increased with ram-pressure ratio for a given <b>corrected</b> engine speed above 14, 500 rpm and reached a maximum of 425 pounds at a ram-pressure ratio of 1. 8 and a <b>corrected</b> engine speed of 16, 650 rpm, The <b>corrected</b> thrust specific fuel consumption decreased with flight speed for <b>corrected</b> engine speeds higher than 13, 600 rpm, The minimum <b>corrected</b> thrust specific fuel consumption of 1. 48 was obtained at a ram-pressure ratio of 1, 8 and a <b>corrected</b> engine speed of 15, 000 rpm.
