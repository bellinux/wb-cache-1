If there is a shortfall in <b>contractual</b> <b>loan</b> payments from the Borrowers or if loan collateral is liquidated and does not generate sufficient proceeds to meet payments on all bond classes, the investors in the most subordinate bond class will incur a loss with further losses impacting more senior classes in reverse order of priority.|$|E
40|$|We match large U. S. corporations' {{tax returns}} during 1989 - 2001 to their {{financial}} statements {{to construct a}} firm-level proxy of firms' use of off-balance sheet and hybrid debt financing. We find that firms with less favorable prior-period Standard & Poor's (S&P) bond ratings or higher leverage ratios in comparison to their industry report greater amounts of interest expense on their tax returns than to investors and creditors on their financial statements. These between-firm {{results are consistent with}} credit-constrained firms using more structured financing arrangements. Our within-firm tests also suggest that firms use more structured financing arrangements when they enter into <b>contractual</b> <b>loan</b> agreements that provide incentives to manage debt ratings. Specifically, we find that after controlling for S&P bond rating and industry-adjusted leverage, our sample firms report greater amounts of interest expenses for tax than for financial statement purposes when they enter into performance pricing contracts that use senior debt rating covenants to set interest rates. Furthermore, we find that the greatest book-tax reporting changes occur when firms become closer to violating these debt rating covenants. These latter findings are consistent with firms' contractual debt covenants influencing their use of off-balance sheet and hybrid debt financing.

The move came after, according to their 2010 SEC filings, PARC defaulted on their lease obligations on the properties.

40|$|Abstract: This thesis {{consists}} of four chapters that empirical explore issues related to bank credit supply, corporate bankruptcy risk, and firms’ leverage decisions. The first chapter explores the role of <b>contractual</b> externalities in <b>loan</b> contracts. The second chapter evaluates the extent trade credit chains between corporate firms lead to propagation of corporate failures. The third chapter explores non-linear relationships between firm failure and leverage, earnings, and liquidity. The final chapter studies the importance of credit supply frictions on corporate capital structure. ...|$|R
40|$|Theories of {{financial}} intermediation predict that bank loans {{should not be}} marketable because of moral hazard problems; banks will not conduct credit risk analysis or monitor borrowers {{if they are not}} at risk for failing to perform these services. Throughout most of history, bank loans have not, in fact, been marketable. Yet, {{by the end of the}} 1980 's the amount of commercial and industrial oan sales outstanding had grown to over $ 250 billion from trivial amounts at the beginning of the decade. To explain the opening of this loan sales market, we present a model of incentive-compatible loan sales that allows for implicit <b>contractual</b> features between <b>loan</b> sellers and loan buyers. We then test for the presence of these features using a sample of over 800 recent loan sales...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to assess the}} influence of several factors on the repayment rate of the Village Credit Institutions (Lembaga Perkreditan Desa or simply LPDs) in Gianyar district in Bali. Using a quantitative approach (logistic model) {{the findings of this}} study indicate that the Balinese social custom, including social values, norms, and sanctions (informal institutions) have an influence on sustaining the high repayment rate of the LPDs. This finding conforms to the some previous studies using institutional approach that reveal the high repayment rate of the LPDs in Gianyar district is influenced by their institutional arrangement that based on custom regulation which includes social norms, sanctions, and involvement of custom village leader in screening process and <b>contractual</b> enforcement of <b>loan</b> (informal institutions), by regulations set up by the Central Bank (formal institutions), and by the mechanism of collecting loan repayments applied by the LPDs management...|$|R
5000|$|Much {{attention}} on hyperinflation {{centers on the}} effect on savers whose investments become worthless. Interest rate changes often cannot keep up with hyperinflation or even high inflation, certainly with contractually fixed interest rates. For example, in the 1970s in the United Kingdom inflation reached 25% per annum, yet interest rates did not rise above 15%—and then only briefly—and many fixed interest rate loans existed. Contractually, there is often no bar to a debtor clearing his long term debt with [...] "hyperinflated cash", nor could a lender simply somehow suspend the <b>loan.</b> <b>Contractual</b> [...] "early redemption penalties" [...] were (and still are) often based on a penalty of n months of interest/payment; again no real bar to paying off {{what had been a}} large loan. In interwar Germany, for example, much private and corporate debt was effectively wiped out—certainly for those holding fixed interest rate loans.|$|R
50|$|Businesses {{that need}} more capital than their founders can raise by {{personal}} contacts are enabled by this legal method of attracting investors {{to buy a}} portion of the business. Owners would invest capital and obtain common stock or equity in exchange for invested cash or other property like machines, factories, warehouses, patents or other interests. Then the owners would raise additional capital by borrowing from lenders in capital markets by selling bonds. In corporation law, the owners of these bonds come first in line for repayment so that if there is not sufficient funds to repay the bondholders, the stockholders get wiped out. The bondholders step into the shoes of the former shareholders. The shareholders own nothing because they, the owners, could not fully repay all the <b>contractual</b> promises, or <b>loans.</b> So like a bank (the mortgagee) that has lent money to a home buyer (the mortgagor) takes possession of the security (the home) when mortgage payments are not made (i.e. foreclosure), the bondholders of a corporation take possession of the business from the former owners (the shareholders) when the corporation falls into bankruptcy. Thus, when shareholders cannot repay bondholders, in principle, bondholders become the new shareholders. In practice, however, it is more complicated.|$|R
