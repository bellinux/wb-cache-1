Even though these measurements brought landmark results, a lot still remains to be done concerning the temporal and spatial varia-tions of the prominence magnetic ¯eld and its relationship with the ¯ne structures of the plasma (e. g. feet/barbs and vertical threads).

We present here the first observations ever using a gaussian aperture pupil mask (GAPM) on the Penn State near-IR Imager and Spectrograph (PIRIS) at the Mt. Wilson 100 ^" telescope. Two nearby stars were observed, ϵ Eridani and μ Her A. A faint companion was detected around μ Her A, confirming it as a proper motion companion. Furthermore, the observed H and K magnitudes of the companion were used to constrain its nature. No companions or faint structure were observed for ϵ Eridani. We found that our observations with the GAPM achieved contrast levels similar to our coronographic images, without blocking light from the central star. The mask's performance also nearly reached sensitivities reported for other ground based adaptive optics <b>coronographs</b> and deep HST images, but did not reach theoretically predicted contrast levels.

40|$|Natural (such as lunar) occultations {{have long}} been used to study sources on small angular scales, while <b>coronographs</b> {{have been used to}} study high {{contrast}} sources. We propose launching the Big Occulting Steerable Satellite (BOSS), a large steerable occulting satellite to combine both of these techniques. BOSS will have several advantages over standard occulting bodies. BOSS would block all but about 4 × 10 − 5 of the light at 1 micron in the region of interest around the star for planet detections. Because the occultation occurs outside the telescope, scattering inside the telescope does not degrade this performance. BOSS could be combined with a space telescope at the Earth-Sun L 2 point to yield very long integration times, in excess of 3000 s. If placed in Earth orbit, integration times of 160 – 1600 s can be achieved from most major telescope sites for objects in over 90 % of the sky. Applications for BOSS include direct imaging of planets around nearby stars. Planets separated by as little as 0. 1 – 0. 25 as from the star they orbit could be seen down to a relative intensity as little as 1 × 10 − 9 around a magnitude 8 (or brighter) star.

40|$|The {{joint use}} of {{high-resolution}} data from PROBA 2 and SDO satellites and LASCO/SOHO <b>coronographs</b> {{enabled us to}} examine early stages of initiation and propagation of six limb CMEs registered in June 2010 - June 2011. For five events under consideration, the CME initiation is marked by filament (prominence) eruption or by a loop-like structure having another nature. Subsequently, several loop-like structures having higher brightness and following each other at different velocities appear {{in the region of}} the CME initiation. The CME frontal structure is formed by these loop-like structures. The time-dependent velocities and acceleration of the ejection front have been obtained for all CMEs under consideration. We have drawn a conclusion about the possible existence of two CME types dependent on the time profile of their velocity. The first CME type comprises the ejections whose velocity decreases abruptly by more than 100 km/s after having reached the maximum; it thereupon passes to slow deceleration/variation. The second CME type is formed by the ejections whose velocity varies insignificantly after reaching the maximum. The CME angular size is shown to increase up to threefold at the initial stage of propagation; it increases twofold 3. 5 - 11 minutes after the first measurement of this parameter.

If placed in Earth orbit, integration times of 250 – 2500 s can be achieved over 95 % of the sky, from most major telescope sites. Alternatively, combining IRIS with a basic 2 -m (or 4 -m) space telescope at the Earth-Sun L 2 point could yield longer integration times and simplified orbital dynamics. Applications for IRIS include searching for planets around nearby stars, resolution of micro-lensed LMC and Galactic bulge stars into distinct image pairs, and detailed mapping of solar system planets from the ground. Using ground-based K-band observations, a Jovian planet with a surface temperature of 400 K or Venus at 700 K could be imaged at all angular separations greater than about 0. 35 as out to over 10 pc.

50|$|On 14 November 2013, Comet ISON was {{reported}} to be {{visible to the naked eye}} by experienced observers located at dark sites. It had an appearance similar to comet C/2013 R1 that was also visible to the naked eye. Comet ISON was not expected to reach the naked-eye magnitude of 6 until mid-November, and was not expected to be observable by the general public until it brightened to about magnitude 4. On 17-18 November, when Comet ISON was brighter and much closer to the morning twilight, it passed the bright star Spica in the constellation Virgo. But due to the full Moon and glow of twilight, Comet ISON had not become bright enough to be seen without optical aid by the general public. On 22 November, it started to drop below Mercury in the bright twilight. SOHO started to view it on 27 November, first with the LASCO <b>coronograph.</b> On 27 November ISON brightened to magnitude −2 and passed Delta Scorpii. Around the time it reached perihelion on 28 November, it might have become extremely bright if it had remained fully intact. However, predicting the brightness of a comet is difficult, especially one that passes so close to the Sun and is affected by the forward scattering of light. Originally, media sources predicted that it might become brighter than the full Moon, but based on more recent observations, it was only expected to reach around apparent magnitude −3 to −5, about the same brightness as Venus. In comparison, the brightest comet since 1935 was Comet Ikeya-Seki in 1965 at magnitude −10, which was much brighter than Venus. On 29 November 2013, Comet ISON had dimmed to magnitude 5 in the LASCO images. By the end of 30 November 2013, it had further faded to below naked-eye visibility at magnitude 7.|$|E
