Contrary to much of the speculation it concludes that <b>co-operatives</b> have similar survival rates and patterns of growth to those of other small businesses. However, <b>co-operatives</b> tend to be concentrated in certain sub-sectors and their survival rates also vary between sectors, tending to confirm those writers who suggest that despite good performance once set up, <b>co-operatives</b> will tend to have a limited role in the economy...|$|R

40|$|CHRIS CORNFORTH is {{with the}} <b>Co-operatives</b> Research Unit of the Open University in the United Kingdom. Although {{the last ten years}} has seen a revival in the worker <b>co-operatives</b> sector in the UK it remains {{relatively}} small and economically weak. The primary aim {{of this paper is to}} consider how the sector might be strengthened and the implications this has for policy aimed at supporting <b>co-operatives,</b> and more generally small businesses. It is argued that the lack of appeal of <b>co-operatives</b> to potential entrepreneurs, the position of <b>co-operatives</b> in the economy and various constraints on growth are important barriers to the development of the sector. The paper examines the successful Mondragon <b>co-operatives</b> in Spain to see what lessons can be learned about how these barriers might be overcome. It is argued that the Mondragon experience challenges the dominant model of <b>co-operatives</b> and small business promotion in the UK. It argues that more resources need to be concentrated on assisting small businesses and <b>co-operatives</b> with the potential for growth and encouraging collaborative links between them. It is suggested that in order to achieve these ends the entrepreneurial process will need to be further institutionalised in the organisations that support <b>co-operatives</b> and small businesses...|$|R

However, worker <b>co-operatives</b> have not achieved the expected results and have mostly remained survivalist in nature, In the literature study, this research explored the potential of worker <b>co-operatives</b> in terms of social and economic development, the state of worker <b>co-operatives</b> in South Africa according to previous research and the challenges faced by worker <b>co-operatives.</b> The submission is that worker <b>co-operatives</b> can only reach their potential in social development when they achieve business success. Therefore, business success factors were determined and criteria for these <b>co-operatives</b> to be classified as successful established. These criteria were as follows:  Longevity (operating for more than three years).  Profitability (showing a surplus for at least one year).  Financial Independence (operating without external funding for at least one year).  Member Income (at least R 955 per member per month). The research population for the research was actively operating worker <b>co-operatives</b> registered as clients with the Small Enterprise Development Agency (Seda). A questionnaire exploring the demographics of members, the financial position of the <b>co-operatives</b> and the way in which they were managed and operated were developed. The questionnaire contained questions with regard to financial practices and management, marketing management and activities, operations management, human resource management, management processes. and the support received from development institutions. In addition to the evaluation of the business performance in terms of the criteria for success, the research evaluates the way in which worker <b>co-operatives</b> are managed and operated in terms of established business practices. It, moreover, explores the impact of support initiatives by government institutions and a framework for future development efforts is suggested. The study‟s results show that worker <b>co-operatives</b> are operating at a level where they are unable to fulfil their expected role in economic and social development. Various management and operational challenges were identified. Moreover, it was found that current support initiatives do not have the desired developmental effect. Doctora...|$|R

40|$|Background: In the Netherlands, out-of-hours {{primary care}} has been re-organized from small on-call rota groups to {{large-scale}} GP <b>co-operatives.</b> However, out-of-hours palliative care {{is an area}} of concern. According to studies in the UK, the transfer of information about terminally ill patients to GP <b>co-operatives</b> seems to be poor, resulting in care that is often inadequate. Our aim was to investigate the experiences of GPs in the Netherlands about the quality of out-of-hours palliative care provided by GP <b>co-operatives,</b> and to identify elements of care that might need to be improved. Methods : Setting: General practice. Design: Qualitative study, using three focus group discussions, analysed in a qualitative descriptive approach. Results : GPs participating in the focus groups, considered the quality of out-of-hours palliative care that is provided by GP <b>co-operatives</b> to be meagre. The service provided by the <b>co-operatives</b> was designed for acute medical problems, rather than for palliative care needs. The GPs reported three major problems: (1) lack of adequate information at the GP out-of-hours service; (2) lack of anticipatory care during office hours; and (3) absence of a palliative care policy in the GP <b>co-operatives.</b> Conclusions : Although GP <b>co-operatives</b> are capable of providing continuity in palliative care, improvements could be achieved if GPs and GP <b>co-operatives</b> address the problems mentioned above...|$|R
