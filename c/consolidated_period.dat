This was possible because they were replacing the native population. The guidelines of the provinces are the same with some exceptions e. g. Alicante. All these experiences contrast with the inertia, shown to date, in the movement/'escape' of native women to urban environments seeking greater autonomy and self dependence. It can be seen that the cases studied show the opposite dynamic, hereby contributing to the sustainable socio-economic framework of the rural Valencian Community...|$|E

40|$|Objective: This paper reports {{selected}} {{findings from}} a study that investigated nursing students' experience of belongingness. The manner in which this experience {{is influenced by the}} duration of students' clinical placements is the focus of the discussion. Design: A mixed method, multi-site case study approach using an anonymous online survey: the Belongingness Scale - Clinical Placement Experience was completed by 362 students, 18 of whom also participated in semi-structured interviews. Setting: The setting for the study was two Australian universities and one university in the United Kingdom offering undergraduate nursing programs. Subjects: Third year undergraduate students (n= 362) were recruited into the study. Main outcome measure: Nurses experience of belongingness and the influence of the duration of clinical placement on the experience of belongingness. Results: Students' self-concept, degree of self-efficacy, confidence, resilience, willingness to question or conform to poor practice, career decisions, capacity and motivation to learn were all impacted by {{the extent to which they}} experienced belongingness. Differences in belongingness scores between the students from the three sites were statistically significant, with participants from the United Kingdom scoring higher than those from either of the Australian sites, F(2, 355) = 21. 70, p = <. 001, ηp² = 0. 11. Although the reasons for these results are multifactorial, this study found the duration and structure of clinical placements to be one of the most important factors affecting students' belongingness. Conclusion: A <b>consolidated</b> <b>period</b> of practice for students to 'settle in' and establish collegial relationships is an important influence on their experience of belonging and a necessary precursor to their active and participative learning. Findings from this study call for a re-examination of the assumptions, educational philosophies, policies and practices that underpin the duration of clinical placements in contemporary undergraduate nursing programs...|$|E

40|$|Orexin {{deficiency}} {{results in}} narcolepsy in humans, dogs, and rodents, {{suggesting that the}} orexin system is particularly important for maintenance of wakefulness. However, orexin neurons are ‘multi-tasking’ neurons that regulate sleep/wake {{states as well as}} feeding behavior, emotion, and reward processes. Orexin deficiency causes abnormalities in energy homeostasis, stress-related behavior, and reward systems. Orexin excites waking-active monoaminergic and cholinergic neurons in the hypothalamus and brain stem regions to maintain a long, <b>consolidated</b> waking <b>period.</b> Orexin neurons also have reciprocal links with the hypothalamic nucleus, which regulates feeding. Moreover, the responsiveness of orexin neurons to peripheral metabolic cues suggests that these neurons have an important role as a link between energy homeostasis and vigilance states. The link between orexin and the ventral tegmental nucleus serves to motivate an animal to engage in goal-directed behavior. This review focuses on the interaction of orexin neurons with emotion, reward, and energy homeostasis systems. These connectivities are likely to be highly important to maintain proper vigilance states...|$|R

40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that both procedural skills and episodic memories <b>consolidate</b> across <b>periods</b> of offline retention, and most particularly across periods of sleep. Such consolidation {{has been demonstrated}} to be more marked for emotional than for neutral episodes, but the interaction between emotionality and the offline consolidation of procedural skills {{has yet to be}} investigated. Here, we address this issue by examining the impact of an emotional background context at encoding upon the subsequent consolidation of mirror tracing, a well-studied procedural skill. We also consider the importance of sleep for such consolidation by manipulating the retention interval (over a day, overnight, or over 24 h containing normal sleep). Our data show significantly greater offline improvements in the accuracy of mirror tracing when negative emotional content is present during the training phase when compared to when neutral or positive content is present. Furthermore, consolidation across a night of sleep is associated with faster and more accurate performance than consolidation across a day of wakefulness. These novel findings show that the emotional context in which a procedural skill is learned can impact upon subsequent offline consolidation...|$|R

The methods used in the present research were borrowed from the previous one; the findings of the two investigations can thus be fairly compared. The results are presented according to the following sub-topics: the young mothers’ working status, use of childcare frequency of physical activity, presence of back pain, and smoking habits. In conclusion, it is stated that the relevant changes in the young mothers’ social and economic environment serve as a fair explanation for their changing situations in the studied countries...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothalamus}} monitors body homeostasis and regulates various {{behaviors such}} as feeding, thermogenesis, and sleeping. Orexins (also known as hypocretins) were identified as endogenous ligands for two orphan G-protein-coupled receptors in the lateral hypothalamic area. They were initially recognized as regulators of feeding behavior, but they are mainly regarded as key modulators of the sleep/wakefulness cycle. Orexins activate orexin neurons, monoaminergic and cholinergic neurons in the hypothalamus/brainstem regions, to maintain a long, <b>consolidated</b> awake <b>period.</b> Anatomical studies of neural projections from/to orexin neurons and phenotypic characterization of transgenic mice revealed various roles for orexin neurons in the coordination of emotion, energy homeostasis, reward system, and arousal. For example, orexin neurons are regulated by peripheral metabolic cues, including ghrelin, leptin, and glucose concentration. This suggests that they may provide a link between energy homeostasis and arousal states. A link between the limbic system and orexin neurons might be important for increasing vigilance during emotional stimuli. Orexins are also involved in reward systems and the mechanisms of drug addiction. These findings suggest that orexin neurons sense the outer and inner environment {{of the body and}} maintain the proper wakefulness level of animals for survival. This review discusses the mechanism by which orexins maintain sleep/wakefulness states and how this mechanism relates to other systems that regulate emotion, reward, and energy homeostasis...|$|R

40|$|Chronic {{restriction}} of a basic biological need induces adaptations to help meet requisites for survival. The adaptations to chronic {{restriction of}} sleep are unknown. A single episode of 10 days of partial sleep loss in rats previously {{was shown to}} be tolerated and to result in increased food intake and loss of body weight as principal signs. The {{purpose of the present}} experiment was to investigate the extent to which adaptation to chronic sleep restriction would ameliorate short-term effects and result in a changed internal phenotype. Rats were studied during 10 wk of multiple periods of restricted and unrestricted sleep to allow adaptive changes to develop. Control rats received the same ambulatory requirements only <b>consolidated</b> into <b>periods</b> that lessened interruptions of their sleep. The results indicate a latent period of relatively stable food and water intake without weight gain, followed by a dynamic phase marked by enormous increases in food and water intake and progressive loss of body weight, without malabsorption of calories. Severe consequences ensued, marked especially by changes to the connective tissues, and became fatal for two individuals. The most striking changes to internal organs in sleep-restricted rats included lengthening of the small intestine, decreased size of adipocytes, and increased incidence of multilocular adipocytes. Major organs accounted for an increased proportion of total body mass. These changes to internal tissues appear adaptive in response to high energy production, decomposition of lipids, and increased need to absorb nutrients, but ultimately insufficient to compensate for inadequate sleep...|$|R
