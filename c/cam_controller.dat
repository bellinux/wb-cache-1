This paper describes a novel architecture design and characterization of a reusable soft IP core for <b>CAM</b> <b>controller</b> with sequential replacement policy, so as to improve the match ratio of the CAM memory. The proposed design was modeled using Verilog HDL and also prototyped in Xilinx ® SPARTAN family FPGA. The power analysis was done using XPower ® analyzer and the hardwar...|$|E

40|$|The IEEE 802. 11 p is the {{technology}} dedicated to vehicular communications to support road safety, efficiency, and comfort applications. A {{large number of}} research activities {{have been carried out}} to study the characteristics of the IEEE 802. 11 p. The key weakness of the IEEE 802. 11 p is the channel congestion issue, where the wireless channel gets saturated when the road density increases. The European Telecommunications Standardization Institute (ETSI) is in the progress of studying the channel congestion problem and proposed so-called Reactive Distributed Congestion Control (DCC) algorithm as a solution to the congestion issue. In this report we investigate the impacts of the Reactive DCC mechanism in comparison to the conventional IEEE 802. 11 p with no congestion control. Our study shows that the Reactive DCC scheme creates oscillation on channel load that consequently degrades communication performance. The results reveal that the channel load oscillation {{is due to the fact}} that in the Reactive DCC, the individual CAM (Cooperative Awareness Message) controllers react to the channel congestion in a synchronized manner. To reduce the oscillation, in this report we propose a simple extension to Reactive DCC, Asynchronous Reactive DCC, in which the individual <b>CAM</b> <b>controllers</b> adopt randomized rate setting, which can significantly reduce the oscillation and improve the network performance...|$|R

5000|$|While {{they were}} similar in many respects to the 1938 stock, the main {{differences}} were that the body panels were unpainted aluminium, rather than painted steel, a rubber suspension system was used on the bogies, {{reducing the number of}} parts that required regular maintenance, and the lighting was provided by fluorescent tubes, rather than incandescent bulbs. The front ends were flatter above the roof line, as the destination blind was fitted over the front cab door, rather than below the cab window. Control was provided by a PCM (Pneumatic <b>Cam</b> Motor) <b>controller,</b> supplied by Associated Electrical Industries, which had proved to be reliable in the 1938 stock.|$|R
