5|$|Aside {{from his}} {{profound}} differences with psychoanalytic ideas, the theoretical basis of Bowlby's monograph was <b>controversial</b> <b>in</b> {{a number of}} ways. Some profoundly disagreed with the necessity for maternal (or equivalent) love in order to function normally, or that {{the formation of an}} ongoing relationship with a child was an important part of parenting. The idea that early experiences have serious consequences for intellectual and psychosocial development was <b>controversial</b> <b>in</b> itself. Others questioned the extent to which his hypothesis was supported by the evidence. There was criticism of the confusion of the effects of privation (no primary attachment figure) and deprivation (loss of the primary attachment figure) and in particular, of the failure to distinguish between the effects of the lack of a primary attachment figure and the other forms of deprivation and understimulation that might affect children in institutions.|$|E

5|$|As {{a primary}} route to southwestern England, the A303 is {{frequently}} congested on its single carriageway sections. As {{it passes through}} the Stonehenge World Heritage Site and the Blackdown Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, attempts to upgrade the road in those areas have been <b>controversial.</b> <b>In</b> particular, the Stonehenge tunnel, which would see the A303 rerouted underground, has been proposed and delayed several times. Nevertheless, the road remains a popular alternative to motorway driving, and was commemorated in a book and BBC Four television documentary by Tom Fort in the early 2010s.|$|E
5|$|Branham {{became more}} <b>controversial</b> <b>in</b> {{his later years}} and this was {{particularly}} evident in his development of a theology that emphasized a few select doctrines. His theology seemed complicated and bizarre to many people who admired him personally. Although not always consistent with each other, his primary concerns were eschatology, the denial of an eternal hell, Oneness Pentecostalism, predestination, eternal security and the serpent's seed. Branham asserted that his doctrinal teachings were {{given to him by}} divine revelation.|$|E

5|$|On September 11, 2012, the U.S. {{diplomatic}} mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked, {{resulting in the}} deaths of the U.S. Ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The attack, questions surrounding the security of the U.S. consulate and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically <b>controversial</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. On October 15, Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses and said the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events.|$|E
5|$|On the day {{following}} the meeting, Shea offered his resignation, becoming instead a special advisor to Daniel Goldin. NASA {{reported that he}} had resigned due to health reasons.

5|$|Operation Una was {{the only}} {{unsuccessful}} operation by the HV {{from a series of}} offensives which had commenced in November 1994.

In 2006, Croatian authorities launched an investigation into alleged war crimes committed by HV soldiers during the operation, in which 40 Serb civilians were killed.|$|E

5|$|Portrait of Madame Cézanne (sometimes Portrait of Mrs. Cézanne) is a 1962 Pop art {{painting}} by Roy Lichtenstein. It is a quotation of Erle Loran's diagram of a Cézanne {{painting of the}} same name. It {{was one of the}} works exhibited at Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition in Los Angeles. The work became <b>controversial</b> <b>in</b> that it led to a reconsideration of what constitutes art.|$|E

5|$|The Schießbefehl was, not surprisingly, very <b>controversial</b> <b>in</b> the West and was {{singled out}} for {{criticism}} by the West Germans. The GDR authorities occasionally suspended the Schießbefehl on occasions when {{it would have been}} politically inconvenient to have to explain dead refugees, such as during a visit to the GDR by the French foreign minister in 1985. It was also a problem for many of the East German guards and was the motivating factor behind a number of escapes, when guards facing a crisis of conscience defected because of their unwillingness to shoot fellow citizens.|$|E
5|$|The {{action would}} prove <b>controversial</b> <b>in</b> the United States as several officers' reports {{suggested}} that Lieutenant Maley, commander of Experiment, had shown cowardice during the engagement. Lieutenant Porter stated that Maley {{had tried to}} insist on surrendering to the picaroons immediately upon their arrival. It was alleged that Maley thought the situation was hopeless due to {{the sheer number of}} pro-French Haitians who were attacking the convoy, and he had attempted to strike the colors.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} in Elvebakken was somewhat <b>controversial</b> <b>in</b> Alta, {{especially as the}} airport would be located {{so close to the}} town center, potentially causing noise pollution. An alternative at Sokkelma was considered, but this was discarded because the surrounding mountains prevented good landing conditions. The decision to build Alta Airport was made in 1961, followed by additional expropriation of land. Construction was carried out simultaneously with that of Banak and Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen, which combined would give Finnmark three primary airports.|$|E
