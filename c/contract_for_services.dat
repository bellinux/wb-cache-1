25|$|Other {{tests of}} {{employment}} {{have focused on}} different contractual and external factors. Lord Denning proposed a test based on the integration of an individual to a business or organisation. Tests based on the economic relationship between an employer and employee have found favour in subsequent cases, notably Market Investigations Ltd v Minister of Social Security, in the decision of Lord Cooke. Here, it was argued that where a person was in business on their own account (and at their own risk), they would be under a <b>contract</b> <b>for</b> <b>services,</b> whilst otherwise they would be under a contract of service. This idea have been cited with approval by the Privy Council, with several relevant factors being considered, such as risk of loss, and chance of profit.|$|E

[...] Services may be provided directly by the Trust or its member hospitals, but are typically outsourced. [...] In many locations in Norway, the provision of land {{ambulance service}} is contracted to private operators, most typically large scale transportation companies operating a variety of types of service. [...] Namsos Trafikkselskap (NTS) {{is an example of a}} private company participating in this type of arrangement for service delivery. [...] While the majority of such arrangements are currently with Norwegian-based companies, this is changing, and international companies, such as Falck are beginning to <b>contract</b> <b>for</b> <b>services</b> in some areas. [...] Such services may operate 24 hours per day in larger centers, but in remote and rural locations are still frequently staffed by 'on-call' personnel after normal business hours. [...] Even in areas with directly operated emergency ambulances, non-emergency transportation is more likely to be conducted by commercial transportation companies. [...] Norway currently operates on the Franco-German model of EMS care, with some limitations on the permitted skills of EMS personnel, and physician response to emergencies being quite commonplace.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades governments have {{increasingly}} contracted-out the provision of public and human services to outside organisations. These contracts were not designed to regulate the wages and other working conditions of the workers employed by the external organisation. There is increasing evidence that <b>contracts</b> <b>for</b> <b>services</b> are being used as a tool to regulate labour standards for workers, usurping the labour law provisions covering these workers’ labour standards. The central objective of this thesis is to analyse how labour standards are regulated through the combination of labour law and <b>contracts</b> <b>for</b> <b>services</b> when services are contracted-out. This is achieved with a case study of NSW government school cleaning contracts. These are amongst the largest <b>contracts</b> <b>for</b> <b>services</b> in the world, with more than 6, 000 employees providing cleaning services. The case study reveals that government <b>contracts</b> <b>for</b> <b>services</b> have taken a predominant role in how labour standards are negotiated, defined, monitored and enforced, while the employment contract underpinning labour law takes a secondary regulatory role. In practice, the cleaners’ labour standards are poorly monitored and rarely enforced with minimal compliance with standards prescribed by labour law or by the <b>contracts</b> <b>for</b> <b>services.</b> The findings of the analysis are significant for three reasons. First, there is a dearth of research to date that considers how labour is regulated through the combination of labour law and procurement contracts. This is particularly important given the prevalence of procurement in the public services arena. Second, the thesis expands understandings of how labour standards for cleaners, as a subset of vulnerable workers, are regulated. This is significant if contracting-out is used as a strategy to undermine labour standards for the most vulnerable workers. Third, the analysis highlights the problems of labour law becoming subservient to contracts in regulating labour standards...|$|R
