5|$|These were no easy years, again, {{as former}} Afrikaner compatriots {{found each other}} on {{two sides of the}} {{political}} fence, in a rapidly <b>changing</b> <b>world.</b> As in his earlier life, Reitz remained a man of outspoken convictions, which he aired freely. As such, he came into conflict with the Smuts government, and in 1920 he was not re-appointed as president of the Senate. He did remain a member of that House until 1929, however.|$|E
5|$|The Staffordshire Regiment {{only had}} a {{separate}} existence from 1959–2007. As part of the reforms proposed in the 2003 Defence White Paper, Delivering Security in a <b>Changing</b> <b>World,</b> the regiment was merged with the Cheshire Regiment and the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment to form the Mercian Regiment. The amalgamation took place on 1 September 2007 when the Staffordshire Regiment became the 3rd Battalion, the Mercian Regiment. Subsequently, in 2014, The Mercian Regiment reduced its number of regular battalions from three to two, with the 3rd Battalion being disbanded and the personnel being redeployed into the 1st and 2nd Battalions.|$|E
5|$|The <b>changing</b> <b>world</b> {{order that}} the war had brought about, in {{particular}} {{the growth of the}} United States and Japan as naval powers, and the rise of independence movements in India and Ireland, caused a major reassessment of British imperial policy. Forced to choose between alignment with the United States or Japan, Britain opted not to renew its Japanese alliance and instead signed the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, where Britain accepted naval parity with the United States. This decision was the source of much debate in Britain during the 1930s as militaristic governments took hold in Japan and Germany helped in part by the Great Depression, for it was feared that the empire could not survive a simultaneous attack by both nations. The issue of the empire's security was a serious concern in Britain, as it was vital to the British economy.|$|E

50|$|<b>Changing</b> <b>Worlds</b> {{began in}} 1996 at Hibbard Elementary School, a Chicago Public School {{located in the}} diverse, predominately {{immigrant}} Albany Park neighborhood. Its founder Kay Berkson partnered with the school’s staff and parents to create an oral history and photography exhibit. Now occupying three corridors of the school, the exhibit highlights fourteen family stories along with photographs, art work and maps. These stories told by students, {{their parents and grandparents}} are translated into twelve different languages. The project {{led to the development of}} an activity guide with ongoing family programs and classroom curricula that foster an inclusive school community. In 1999 a traveling version of the exhibit was created. The <b>Changing</b> <b>Worlds</b> project became an independent 501c3 nonprofit organization in 2000.|$|R
