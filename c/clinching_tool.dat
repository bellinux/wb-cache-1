40|$|A {{clinching}} {{method that}} uses a simple toolset consisting of a punch and a die, is utilized for joining lightweight materials. This paper is aimed at investigating the wear of the die cavity of a <b>clinching</b> <b>tool.</b> A <b>clinching</b> <b>tool</b> with a specially shaped cavity was used for joining thin hot-dip galvanized steel sheets. Various types of physical vapour deposition (PVD) coatings such as ZrN, CrN and TiCN were deposited on the shaped surface of the die using Lateral Rotating Arc-Cathodes technology. Hot-dip galvanized steel sheets were used for testing the <b>clinching</b> <b>tool.</b> The material properties of PVD coatings that were deposited on the shaped part of the clinching die were evaluated. Finite Element Analysis was used to localize {{the area of the}} shaped part of the die and the part of surface area of the cylindrical die cavity of Ï• 5. 0 mm, in which high contact pressure values were predicted. The prediction of the start of the wear cycle was verified experimentally by the clinching of 300 samples of hot-dip galvanized steel sheets. Unlike the CrN and ZrN coatings, the TiCN coating remained intact on the entire surface of the die...|$|E

For successful multi-material design of automotive body, the joining method for dissimilar materials is required to assemble the automotive components produced by various materials. Especially, hole clinching process is effective to fasten dissimilar materials without any additional joining element. In this study, effect of tool shape on the hole clinching is investigated by FE-analysis and experiments. The parameters related to <b>clinching</b> <b>tool</b> shape are punch diameter, punch corner radius and die depth. The geometrical interlocking is evaluated by the neck-thickness and undercut. Joint strength using single lap shear test is evaluated also to verify the effectiveness of hole clinching as automotive joints...|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{the choice}} of the <b>clinching</b> <b>tools</b> highly affects the joining {{strength}} and the absorbed energy of a clinched connection other than the joining force. Rectangular tools, for example, require lower joining forces than round tools since the material shearing, while among the round <b>clinching</b> <b>tools</b> split dies require the minimum joining force and the largest interlock.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the process}} {{involves}} relatively low forces (ranging from 5 to 50 kN {{depending on the}} material to join, type of tools and sheet thicknesses), clinching generally involves reduced size (often portable) machines. The tools typically consist of a punch and a die. Different tools have been developed so far, which can be classified in round and rectangular <b>tools.</b> Round <b>clinching</b> <b>tools</b> include: fixed grooved dies, split dies (with 2-4 movable sectors) and flat dies. Such tools produce round joints which show almost identical mechanical behaviors in all plane directions. When round tools are adopted, {{the integrity of the}} sheet in the joint must be guaranteed in order to preserve a good mechanical behavior of the joints.|$|R

Clinching does not require electricity or cooling of the electrodes commonly associated with spot welding. Being a mechanical joining process, clinching {{can be used to}} join materials showing no electrical conductivity such as polymers or plastic-metal composites. In addition, it does not require a substrate preparation such as pre-cleaning of surfaces which is required for welding processes. This fact contributes to reduce the joining costs and the environmental impact (since chemical cleaning is not required).Clinching does not generate sparks or fumes. The strength of a clinched joint can be tested non-destructively using a simple measuring instrument to measure the remaining thickness {{at the bottom of the}} joint, of the diameter of the produced button depending on the type of tools employed. Life expectancy for <b>clinching</b> <b>tools</b> is in the hundreds of thousands of cycles, making it an economical process. Clinched connections performed on aluminum sheets have higher fatigue life as compared to spot welding.|$|R
