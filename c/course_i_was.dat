5|$|The {{books are}} based on the vampire myth, but Twilight vampires differ in a number of {{particulars}} from the general vampire lore. For instance, Twilight vampires have strong piercing teeth rather than fangs; they glitter in sunlight rather than burn; and they can drink animal as well as human blood. Meyer comments that her vampire mythology differs from that of other authors because she wasn't informed about the canon vampires, saying, It wasn't until I knew that Twilight would be published that I began to think about whether my vampires were too much the same or too much different from the others. Of <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> far too invested in my characters at that point to be making changes... so I didn't cut out fangs and coffins and so forth as a way to distinguish my vampires; that's just how they came to me.|$|E

When asked whether the politics attracted him to the film, Rea replied [...] "Well, I don't {{think it would be very}} interesting if it was just comic-book stuff. The politics of it are what gives it its dimension and momentum, and of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> interested in the politics. Why wouldn't I be?" ...|$|E
500|$|Speer {{supported}} the German invasion of Poland and subsequent war, though {{he recognized that}} {{it would lead to}} the postponement, at the least, of his architectural dreams. In his later years, Speer, talking with his biographer-to-be Gitta Sereny, explained how he felt in 1939: [...] "Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> perfectly aware that [...] sought world domination...t that time I asked for nothing better. That was the whole point of my buildings. They would have looked grotesque if Hitler had sat still in Germany. All I wanted was for this great man to dominate the globe." ...|$|E

Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> unfit to deal with members of Parliament who would flock around me because they wanted places.

500|$|In 1960, the RAF {{contacted}} Stanley and {{the idea}} of restoring the murals was brought up. He was initially reluctant to return to restore his works due to the painful memories of war and captivity the murals would bring back to him: [...] "I didn't immediately want to come. I felt that there would be some sort of... trauma. I'm trying to forget this, you know, I tried so hard... It took years really to eliminate the memories and fears... the long drawn out experience and really waiting for death over three and a half years, it's long time to expect death. And I really tried to forget... But of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> never able to do that." ...|$|E
500|$|Arsenal's first fixture of November {{was at home}} to Charlton Athletic. The team conceded four {{goals in}} 20 minutes and blew several chances to [...] "kill the game", in what was the club's biggest home defeat in the league under Wenger. An away trip to local rivals Tottenham Hostpur became {{magnified}} with interest, given it marked the return of Campbell following his move to Arsenal. An 81st-minute goal scored by Pirès put Arsenal into the lead, before a lapse by Wright in goal allowed Gus Poyet‘s shot to squirm from his grasp and enter the goalnet. Arsenal then faced league champions Manchester United {{and in spite of}} conceding inside 14 minutes through a Paul Scholes’ strike, Ljungberg equalised for them [...] "with a wonderful chipped finish, following Gary Neville's wretched error." [...] Arsenal improved in the second half but scored in unforeseen fashion: United goalkeeper Fabien Barthez passed the ball directly into the feet of Henry, who profited from the error and scored. Five minutes later, Barthez's failure to grasp the ball presented Henry the chance to score his second, which he did. Both Henry and Wenger defended the opposition goalkeeper, with the former, his international teammate saying: [...] "Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> happy to score the goals but it was strange. He's my good friend and I feel sorry for him; I would rather have got them another way." ...|$|E
500|$|Bill Janovitz of Allmusic {{describes}} the music as beautiful, with folk guitar chord changes and a somber melody, while the chorus, with its line [...] "and it's all over now, Baby Blue" [...] has a heartbreaking quality to it. Like other Dylan {{songs of the}} period, such as [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] and [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", the lyrics of [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] bear the strong influence of Symbolist poets such as Arthur Rimbaud. Lines such as [...] "take what you have gathered from coincidence" [...] reflect the I Ching philosophy that coincidence represents more than mere chance. The song was described by Q magazine as, [...] "The most toxic of strummed kiss-offs, with not a snowball's chance in hell of reconciliation." [...] Dylan, later describing the song, said that [...] "I had carried that song around in my head {{for a long time}} and I remember that when I was writing it, I'd remembered a Gene Vincent song. It had always been one of my favorites, Baby Blue... 'When first I met my baby/she said how do you do/she looked into my eyes and said/my name is Baby Blue.' [...] It was one of the songs I used to sing back in high school. Of <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> singing about a different Baby Blue." ...|$|E

Undoubtedly at the {{pinnacle}} of song-writing considered over the last—30 years, is it?! My fondest recollections are not of the SNF days, which were really a re-birth in the Bee Gees' popularity, but the early ground-breaking songs... I remember singing these [...] with my pal Tim Staffell [...] and Freddie [...] in the real old days." [...] May also praised the song [...] "You Win Again" [...] {{as one of the greatest}} songs of the '80s.|$|E
2500|$|This time, Wagner {{could not}} be stifled as he outhit Cobb, [...]333 to [...]231, and stole six bases, {{establishing}} the new Series record. The speed demon Cobb only managed two steals, one of which Cobb himself admitted was a botched call. Wagner recounted: [...] "We had him out at second. We put up a squawk, but Silk O'Loughlin, the umpire, overruled it. We kept the squawk going {{for a minute or}} so, making no headway of course, and then Cobb spoke up. He turned to O'Loughlin, an American League umpire, by the way, and said, 'Of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> out. They had me by a foot. You just booted the play, so come on, let's play ball.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|After his songwriting {{contributions}} {{were rejected}} from the band's previous album, 1986's Somewhere in Time, Dickinson felt that his role within the band had diminished, as he [...] "just became the singer," [...] but felt renewed enthusiasm when Harris explained the concept to him; [...] "I thought, 'What a great idea! Brilliant!' And of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really chuffed, too, because he'd actually rung {{me to talk}} about it and ask me if I had any songs that might fit that sort of theme. I was like, 'Well, no, but give me a minute and I'll see what I can do.'" [...] Speaking about the record in later years, however, Dickinson remarked that [...] "we almost did [...] ", explaining that, [...] "it was only half a concept album. There was no attempt to see it all the way through, like we really should have done. Seventh Son... has no story. It's about good and evil, heaven and hell, but isn't every Iron Maiden record?" ...|$|E

2500|$|... “The old days. [...] After all {{the fall}} of 1906 is a far piece back, and high school {{football}} then was a mighty casual and simple thing. [...] That was my senior year and I was a ‘new boy’, having just moved to Massillon that summer from the wide open spaces of South Dakota, Wyoming and Nebraska. [...] The first day at school several of my classmates came around to suggest that of <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> coming out for football; and although I protested that I {{had never had a}} ball in my hands, they countered with the argument that I was a good sized lump of a boy and would make a fine prospect. [...] So I promised. [...] Well the only preparation necessary was to take an old pair of shoes down to the town cobbler and have some cleats nailed on them. [...] I think the athletic association must have had some football pants, but I do remember distinctly that you had to furnish your own stockings (any color) and an old sweater. [...] Put these on and you were in business. [...] I can’t believe that there were more than 11 candidates out because I made the team the first afternoon. [...] Nor did we have a regular coach. [...] A boy named Fritz Merwin, who I think had played the year before was our coach. [...] If you ask me, he’s the one whose picture ought to be hanging up around there someplace. [...] He didn’t get paid anything, and if a coach ever had an awkward squad of 11 nit-wits, he did. [...] But he was out there every afternoon, early and late teaching us fundamentals instead of fancy razzle-dazzle plays, and in the end it paid off because we won a few games. [...] I can’t remember who we beat, but I do recall, painfully even after this lapse of time, that our friends over at the county seat (Canton, Ohio) took us to the cleaners twice.” ...|$|E
