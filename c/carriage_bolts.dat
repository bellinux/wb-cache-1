50|$|<b>Carriage</b> <b>bolts</b> were {{developed}} for use through iron strengthening plates {{on either side}} of a wooden beam. It is commonplace though to use them to bare timber, the squared section giving enough grip to prevent rotation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carriage</b> <b>bolts</b> are {{extensively}} used {{in security}} fixings, {{such as the}} Brenton Bolt where the bolt must only be removable from one side. The smooth domed head and square nut below prevent the carriage bolt from being unlocked from the insecure side.|$|E
50|$|The Meriden-Waterbury Turnpike, an east-west road, was {{extended}} through Marion in 1813, making the community a crossroads. Small-scale industrial activity {{began in the}} 19th century, including the manufacture of <b>carriage</b> <b>bolts</b> and nuts in the factory of L.B. Frost and Son, which began operation in Marion in 1842, using the water power of Humiston Brook.|$|E
50|$|A <b>carriage</b> <b>bolt,</b> {{coach bolt}} or round head {{square neck bolt}} {{is a form of}} bolt used to fasten metal to wood.|$|R
50|$|<b>Carriage</b> <b>bolt</b> - Bolt with {{a smooth}} rounded head and a square section to prevent turning {{followed}} with a threaded section for a nut.|$|R
50|$|A screw {{must always}} be turned to {{assemble}} the joint. Many bolts are held fixed in place during assembly, either by a tool or by a design of non-rotating bolt, such as a <b>carriage</b> <b>bolt,</b> and only the corresponding nut is turned.|$|R
50|$|Wooden {{tables are}} {{constructed}} using lumber boards. Protection for the wood (stain, paint, or wood protectant that repels water) is necessary {{to protect it from}} cracking, warping, or rotting due to moisture. The table-top and bench-top boards are attached to the trusses or beams using wood screws or nails. The legs can be secured with <b>carriage</b> <b>bolts</b> fastened by nuts and washers.|$|E
50|$|Stage {{lighting}} suspension bolts {{are most}} commonly 3/8 in and 1/2 in BSW. Companies that initially converted to metric threads have converted back, after complaints that the finer metric threads increased {{the time and}} difficulty of setup, which often {{takes place at the}} top of a ladder or scaffold. Fixings for garden gates traditionally used Whitworth <b>carriage</b> <b>bolts,</b> and these are still the standard supplied in UK.|$|E
50|$|The Clark Brothers Factory No. 1 was a {{historic}} industrial complex at 1331 South Main Street in the Milldale area of Southington, Connecticut. Developed {{beginning in the}} 1850s, {{it was one of}} the nation's largest sources of <b>carriage</b> <b>bolts.</b> The complex listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 consisted of a group of brick buildings dating to 1893 and later. It has since been entirely demolished, and the land stands vacant and overgrown.|$|E
50|$|Plough bolts are a {{flush-fitting}} <b>carriage</b> <b>bolt,</b> {{where the}} head is countersunk beneath the surface. They were first developed to hold replaceable ploughshares onto the mouldboard of iron ploughs. The share is the most quickly wearing part of the plough and would be replaced several times {{over the life of}} the plough.|$|R
50|$|Southington {{originally}} was a small, rural farming community. In the early 1900s, Southington {{developed as a}} manufacturing center, but still maintained a very small population of a few thousand residents. Some of the products invented there include the first cement that was able to harden under water, the first <b>carriage</b> <b>bolt</b> cutting machine, the break-neck rat trap, and a new tinware process.|$|R
50|$|The Micklethwait Baronetcy, of Iridge Place in the County of Sussex, was a {{title in}} the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 27 July 1838 for Peckham Micklethwait. The baronetcy was in honour of him having rescued Princess Victoria when her <b>carriage</b> <b>bolted</b> {{during a visit to}} Hastings in 1834. Micklethwait served as High Sheriff of Sussex in 1848. The title became extinct on his death in 1853.|$|R
50|$|Closely {{related to}} <b>carriage</b> <b>bolts</b> are timber bolts, meant {{for use with}} large wood planks and structures. They have a domed head that is {{proportionally}} wider {{than that of a}} carriage bolt, and instead of a square section of shank under the head, they have four sharp-cornered fillets that grip the edge of the hole in the wood to prevent rotation. They are also known as mushroom head bolts or dome head bolts. They are used to fasten wood to wood, instead of metal to wood.|$|E
50|$|The Clark Brothers Company {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{industrial}} concerns in Southington, and was influential in its growth as an industrial community {{in the second half of}} the 19th century. In the 1850s they developed specialized equipment for the manufacture of <b>carriage</b> <b>bolts,</b> a process they eventually automated in its entirety. Originally located in a factory on South Main Street (since demolished), they had this facility built beginning in 1911, using steam power for the manufacturing processes instead of water. It was expanded during the First World War, and broadened its production line to include other types of fasteners.|$|E
50|$|On two walls, {{usually the}} long walls, the {{dimensional}} lumber girts {{at the top}} of the walls are doubled, one on the inside and one on the outside of the posts, and usually through-bolted with large <b>carriage</b> <b>bolts</b> to support the roof load. The roof structure is frequently a truss roof supporting purlins or laths, or built using common rafters. Wide buildings with common rafters need interior rows of posts. Sometimes rafters may be attached directly to the poles. The roof pitch of pole buildings is usually low and the roof form is usually gable or lean-to. Metal roofing is commonly used as the roofing and siding material on pole buildings.|$|E
50|$|On the disused side of Platform 2, an old <b>carriage</b> is <b>bolted</b> to the ground. Set in its {{window is}} a plaque commemorating 100 years of Steamtrain Hoorn Medemblik, a Dutch steam train.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the visual}} {{distinction}} usually referred {{to is that}} in a state funeral, the gun carriage bearing the coffin is drawn by sailors from the Royal Navy rather than horses. (This tradition dates from the funeral of Queen Victoria; the horses drawing the gun <b>carriage</b> <b>bolted,</b> so ratings from the Royal Navy hauled it to the Royal Chapel at Windsor.) This distinguishing feature is not invariable, however, as shown by the use of naval ratings rather than horses at the ceremonial funeral for Lord Mountbatten in 1979 (one of a number of features on that occasion which emphasized Mountbatten's lifelong links with the Royal Navy).|$|R
50|$|On the disused side of {{platform}} 2 of Huddersfield {{railway station}} in northern England, an old <b>carriage</b> is <b>bolted</b> to the ground, {{and set in}} its window is a Dutch plaque commemorating 100 years of Stoomtram Hoorn - Medemblik.|$|R
5000|$|A screw {{will usually}} have a head on one end that {{contains}} a specially formed shape that allows it to be turned, or driven, with a tool. Common tools for driving screws include screwdrivers and wrenches. The head is usually larger than {{the body of the}} screw, which keeps the screw from being driven deeper than the length of the screw and to provide a bearing surface. There are exceptions; for instance, <b>carriage</b> <b>bolts</b> have a domed head that is not designed to be driven; set screws often have a head smaller than the outer diameter of the screw; J-bolts have a J-shaped head which is not designed to be driven, but rather is usually sunk into concrete allowing it to be used as an anchor bolt. The cylindrical portion of the screw from the underside of the head to the tip is known as the shank; it may be fully threaded or partially threaded. The distance between each thread is called the [...] "pitch".|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of spins and tosses that can be done with the flag. Each spin or toss creates a different illusion and can be used for different tempos. Basic color guard moves include Jazz runs (a Jazz dance move used as a graceful way to run across the marching band field or the gym floor), [...] "right shoulder" [...] (positioning the flag with the bottom of the pole by your belly button and your right hand by the flag's silk tape) and [...] "stripping the flag" [...] (holding the flag silk with your fingers so you won't reveal the color(s) of the flag.) Flag poles and silks both come in different sizes, and there are different shapes and textures for silks, as well. Flags frequently have weights -generally 1 in. <b>carriage</b> <b>bolts</b> or the like- in the bottom and top of the pole {{to make it easier to}} toss the flag into the air. However, even with the weights, weather conditions such as wind and rain can affect a flag's spin and disrupt a toss if not correctly taken into account.|$|E
50|$|Kott's artists {{statement}} reads: I studied art {{in college}} but never pursued it until I was well {{established as a}} professional scriptwriter in Hollywood. Several factors were responsible for my eventual transition from pen to paint, most importantly a stack of eight-foot by ten-foot sheets of plywood found {{in the basement of}} a new house I bought. A week before I’d seen a large, expensive painting in a gallery, a bold color field of red and black. Hmm, I thought, these sheets of plywood were exactly the same size. A quick trip to the local art supply store and I had my first color field hanging over my bed, joined soon by eight-foot by ten-foot color fields in the living room and den. In time I expanded into multi-dimensional sculptures made from junk I treasure-hunted in landfills and city dumps. I was delighted to see people enjoy my typewriters made from <b>carriage</b> <b>bolts</b> and ABS pipe, my seven-foot, found-object guitars oozing in reds, blues, and greens. My paintings moved from plywood to canvas, my color-fields from free-flowing drips to tightly controlled stripes. My evolution from pen to paint has been an exploration of anything and everything I dream up, always capturing images and notions where words fail me.|$|E
50|$|It is {{distinguished}} from other bolts by its shallow mushroom head {{and that the}} shank cross-section of the bolt is circular {{for most of its}} length, as usual, but the portion immediately beneath the head is formed into a square section. This makes the bolt self-locking when placed through a square hole in a metal strap, or a round hole in most wood. This allows the fastener to be installed with only a single tool, a spanner or wrench, working from one side. The head of a <b>carriage</b> <b>bolt</b> is usually a shallow dome. The squared section is of {{the same size as the}} diameter of the bolt shank, with a plain unthreaded shank.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{there is}} no reason to {{consider}} this definition obsolete, because it is far from clear that [...] "a bolt by definition takes a nut" [...] Using a coach [...] "bolt" [...] as an example (and it has been a 'bolt' for a very long time). It was not originally intended to receive a nut, but did have a shank. Its purpose was not to pass through the entire substrate but only one piece of it, while the threaded portion bit into the other in order to draw, and clamp the materials together. The 'carriage' bolt was derived from this and was employed more to speed up manufacturing than achieve a different function. The <b>carriage</b> <b>bolt</b> passes through both pieces of materials and employs a nut to provide the clamping force. Both are still, however, bolts.|$|R
25|$|In mid-March Wood reopened the offensive. He {{intended}} {{to relieve the}} towns under siege, but was ordered by William Gladstone's Cabinet to make peace. Wood wrote to his wife that the treaty would make him “the best abused man in England for a time” but thought it his duty to obey the government’s orders. Wolseley (who thought the treaty “infamous” and “ignominious”) and other officers thought he should have resigned his commission rather than sign it. Wolseley never forgave him for not avenging Colley, and he was criticised by Colley’s biographer William Butler. He had to travel to Pretoria, and was injured on the way when the horses of his <b>carriage</b> <b>bolted.</b> He negotiated peace on 21 March 1881. He was offered but declined, the Governorship of Natal. In April 1881 he was appointed to a commission of inquiry into all matters relating to the future settlement of the Transvaal Territory, {{and put in a}} dissenting opinion about the boundaries.|$|R
50|$|A gripe is {{a simple}} form of clamp used in {{building}} a clinker boat, for temporarily holding the strake which is being fitted onto the one {{to which it is}} to be attached. The strake is relatively thin and wide so that it is necessary for the tool to have a long reach while only a small movement is required. This is achieved by taking two pieces of dense timber, typically oak, each of a length a little more than twice the widest width of the strake. A coach <b>bolt</b> (see <b>carriage</b> <b>bolt)</b> is fitted through the middle and adjusted so that the gripe will fit onto the land (the joint between the adjacent strakes) while admitting the point of a wedge between the free ends of the two parts of the gripe. The wedge is then tapped in so that the gripe grips the land, using the bolt as a fulcrum.|$|R

50|$|A {{drilling}} jumbo consists of one, {{two or three}} rock drill carriages, sometimes a platform, which the miner stands on to load the holes with explosives, clear {{the face of the}} tunnel or else. The <b>carriages</b> are <b>bolted</b> onto the chassis, which supports also the miners cabin and of course the engine. Modern {{drilling jumbo}}s are relatively large, there are however smaller ones for use in cramped conditions. Whereas modern jumbos usually fitted with rubber tyres and diesel powered, there are also exist variants with steel wheels, to ride on rails and even single carriaged sled-mounted ones. Electric power is also common, historical jumbos were powered by compressed air. Electricity and compressed air produce of course no exhaust gases, which is preferable if work is done in smaller tunnels where good ventilation is difficult.|$|R
40|$|The {{present day}} {{atmosphere}} {{seems to be}} so much about one or the other. Whether it is politics, religion, or even something as small as Apple or PC, it seems like it is impossible to exist in the middle; you either 2 ̆ 2 are 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 are not. 2 ̆ 2 With the blinders firmly strapped on, there is so much not coming into view. By only seeing things in absolutes, is what we DO NOT experience and believe as important as what we DO? This is a cumbersome question without a simple yes or no answer. However, rather than attempting to create some kind of resolution, this thesis attempts to reframe this question (in a broader sense) in an effort to remove the blinders and experience things beyond ourselves. More specifically, it attempts to shift the focus from 2 ̆ 2 I 2 ̆ 2 to 2 ̆ 2 We 2 ̆ 2 and how inextricable these two are in defining and understanding each other. Because there are so many facets to this issue, I narrowed my focus on one aspect - gender. I also provided context for the body of work by framing it specifically as a marriage ceremony. Each piece makes a statement on its own, but this statement is made stronger be presenting it with its companion piece. For example, the piece entitled Intimate I, a girdle made of nails and a <b>carriage</b> <b>bolt,</b> is visually powerful on its own and presents clear tension between male and female contexts and materials. However, when paired with the piece Intimate II, an athletic supporter made from straight pins, the presentation becomes more complex and less one-sided. Both gender roles are literally standing {{right in front of the}} viewer, side by side with equal importance. While the viewer expectedly draws on their personal history to interpret what they are seeing, the 2 ̆ 2 other 2 ̆ 2 is also right there, on display for them to experience as well. One cannot shift the social focus centuries in the making by displaying a few pieces of art in a gallery and writing a few words. But hopefully this thesis does call on us to take pause. We stop for a moment to take in a little humanism in a post-humanist age in hopes that it opens the door a crack. Perhaps it lets enough light in to start to question what we think we know about ourselves and ultimately the whole of humanity...|$|R
50|$|Just before 2:45 p.m. on February 17, 1905, the {{carriage}} of the Grand Duke {{passed through the}} gate of Nikolskaya Tower of the Kremlin and turned {{the corner of the}} Chudov Monastery into Senatskaya Square. Then, from a distance no more than four feet away and still some sixty feet inside the Nikolsky Gate, Ivan Kalyayev, a member of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party’s Combat detachment, stepped forward and threw a nitroglycerin bomb directly into Sergei's lap. The explosion disintegrated {{the carriage}} and the Grand Duke died immediately, literally blown to bits. Scattered all over the bloodstained snow lay pieces of scorched cloth, fur and leather. The body of the Grand Duke was mutilated, with the head, {{the upper part of the}} chest and the left shoulder and arm being blown off and completely destroyed. Surrounded by the splintered bones of the skull was the very little that remained of the face. Some of the Grand Duke's fingers, still adorned with the rings he habitually wore, were found on the roof of a nearby building and were recovered some time later.On impact, the <b>carriage</b> horses had <b>bolted</b> towards the Nikolsky Gate, dragging with them the front wheels and coachbox as well as the semi-conscious and badly burned driver Rudinkin, whose back had been riddled with bits of bomb and stones. He was rushed to the nearest hospital, where he died three days later. Kalayev, who by his own testimony had expected to die in the explosion, survived. Sucked into the vortex of the explosion, he ended up by the remains of the rear wheels. His face peppered by splinters, pouring with blood. He was immediately arrested. Sentenced to death, he was hanged two months later.|$|R
