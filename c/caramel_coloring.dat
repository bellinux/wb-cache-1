25|$|Food uses {{of sodium}} {{hydroxide}} include washing or chemical peeling {{of fruits and}} vegetables, chocolate and cocoa processing, <b>caramel</b> <b>coloring</b> production, poultry scalding, soft drink processing, and thickening ice cream. Olives are often soaked in sodium hydroxide for softening; Pretzels and German lye rolls are glazed with a sodium hydroxide solution before baking to make them crisp. Owing to the difficulty in obtaining food grade sodium hydroxide in small quantities for home use, sodium carbonate is often used in place of sodium hydroxide.|$|E
500|$|The makeup {{time for}} the Borg {{expanded}} from the single hour needed for television to five hours, {{in addition to the}} 30minutes necessary to get into costume and 90minutes to remove the makeup {{at the end of the}} day. While Westmore estimated that a fully staffed production would have around 50 makeup artists, First Contact had to make do with fewer than ten people involved in preparation, and at most 20 artists a day. Despite the long hours, Westmore's teams began to be more creative with the prosthetics even as they decreased their preparation times. [...] "They were using two tubes, and then they were using three tubes, and then they were sticking tubes in the ears and up the nose," [...] Westmore explained. [...] "And we were using a very gooey <b>caramel</b> <b>coloring,</b> maybe using a little bit of it, but by the time we got to the end of the movie we had the stuff dripping down the side of [...] faces—it looked like they were leaking oil! So, at the very end , they're more ferocious." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2010, the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) {{concluded}} that commercially produced <b>caramel</b> <b>color</b> {{has the same}} toxicological properties as caramel produced by cooking or heating sucrose, except for those prepared using ammonium (Class III and IV). The IPCS has {{concluded that}} <b>caramel</b> <b>color</b> does not exhibit carcinogenicity or mutagenicity, based on its studies. While the US FDA, Canadian Health Products and Food Branch and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have found <b>caramel</b> <b>color</b> safe for use in food and beverages, California has listed a compound formed {{in the manufacture of}} Class III and IV <b>caramel</b> <b>colors</b> in the state's Proposition 65, thus legally including it in the category of chemicals [...] "known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity".|$|R
5000|$|<b>Caramel</b> <b>color</b> is a colloid. Though {{the primary}} {{function}} of <b>caramel</b> <b>color</b> is for coloration, it also serves additional functions.

2500|$|In Germany, a cheap {{substitute}} for genuine dark rum is called Rum-Verschnitt (literally: blended or [...] "cut" [...] rum). This distilled beverage {{is made of}} genuine dark rum (often from Jamaica), rectified spirit, and water. Very often, <b>caramel</b> <b>coloring</b> is used, too. The relative amount of genuine rum it contains can be quite low, since the legal minimum is at only 5%. In Austria, a similar rum called Inländerrum or domestic rum is available. However, Austrian Inländerrum is always a spiced rum, such as the brand Stroh; German Rum-Verschnitt, in contrast, is never spiced or flavored.|$|E

As such, persons with known sensitivities or allergies to food products are advised to avoid foods including generic <b>caramel</b> <b>coloring</b> or first determine the source for the <b>caramel</b> <b>coloring</b> before consuming the food. North American and European manufacturers mostly use glucose derived from corn or wheat to produce caramel color, which is highly processed and is generally considered gluten-free.|$|E
