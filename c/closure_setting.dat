40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new logic algorithm for real time control of regulation valves in water distribution networks. This method entails identifying {{in real time}} the appropriate <b>closure</b> <b>setting</b> of regulation valves {{in order to reach}} and keep the desired piezometric height at the control node(s), by making use of measurements concerning both the piezometric height and the water discharge in the pipes fitted with regulation valves. In the numerical application herein described this control algorithm is implemented within a hydraulic simulation model and is tested in the case study of a real distribution network, in which there is only one control valve, installed in the pipe linking the serving tank to the network. Results pointed out excellent performance in terms of pressure regulation (with very small deviations from the desired set-point value) and leakage reduction under various operation conditions...|$|E

We compared patients who underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication with simple sutured hiatal closure and those who underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication with prosthetic hiatal <b>closure.</b> <b>Setting</b> University-affiliated community hospital. Patients Forty consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Interventions A 3600 Nissen fundoplication with simple sutured crura (n = 3 D 20; nonmesh group) vs the same procedure with posterior 1 x 3 -cm polypropylene onlay mesh prosthesis (n = 3 D 20; mesh group). Main Outcome Measures Recurrences; postoperative dysphagia rate; localization, length, and pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES); results of 24 -hour pH monitoring; esophageal body motility; peristalsis; and esophageal amplitude of contraction and interrupted waves. Results: Preoperatively, both groups had pathological LES pressure and DeMeester scores. These values improved significantly (P<. 01) after surgery and remained stable at 1 year after surgery.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{considers}} grasps and fixtures whose contacts react {{according to}} force-displacement laws consistent with friction constrains at the contacts. The passive force <b>closure</b> <b>set</b> of such grasps and fixtures is {{the set of}} external wrenches (forces and torques) that can act on the grasped object and be stably balanced by the contacts. An external wrench belongs to this set if it induces a feasible equilibrium whose basin of attraction contains the initial unperturbed grasp configuration. The paper focuses on planar grasps and fixtures hav-ing sharp-tipped fingers or fixels that satisfy linear force displacement laws. Using Morse Theory, the paper characterizes the number and stability type of k-contact equilibria induced by a given external wrench. Based on this analysis, the paper provides closed-form expres-sions for the passive force <b>closure</b> <b>set</b> of k-contact grasps and fixtures. Computation of the allowed external wrenches is illustrated with examples. Finally, the paper describes experi-ments verifying the passive force <b>closure</b> <b>set</b> on a spring-loaded grasping system. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Motion {{planning}} for mechanisms with closed chains has received substantial interest in recent years. Most efforts focus on characterizing the geometry and topology of the <b>closure</b> <b>set</b> and on inverse kinematics. In this paper, {{we show that}} efficient sampling-based motion planning is possible without having either of these. In particular, we develop {{a variant of the}} RRT that uses a kd-tree to actively maintain a sampling domain around the <b>closure</b> <b>set.</b> The method is implemented and has been tested on a dozen examples.

A closure space X is a set endowed with a closure operator P(X) → P(X), satisfying the usual topological axioms, except finite additivity.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess whether}} {{the threat of}} {{unemployment}} affects risk factors for cardiovascular disease. DESIGN [...] Longitudinal study of a cohort of middle aged shipyard workers followed up for a mean of 6. 2 (SD 1. 9) years {{and a group of}} controls observed for the same period. The first investigation took place during a period of relative economic stability for the shipyard and the second during the phase of its <b>closure.</b> <b>SETTING</b> [...] An age cohort health screening programme in Malmö, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS [...] 715 Male shipyard workers and 261 age matched male controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Changes in 19 variables related to the risk of cardiovascular disease, and psychological variables, alcohol consumption, smoking, and dietary habits as assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS [...] Serum cholesterol concentrations increased more (mean 0. 25 (SD 0. 68) mmol/l v 0. 08 (0. 66) mmol/l) and serum calcium concentrations decreased less (- 0. 06 (0. 10) mmol/l v - 0. 08 (0. 09) mmol/l) in the shipyard workers than in the controls. A correlation was found between scores for sleep disturbance and changes in serum cholesterol concentration. In the whole series there was a greater increase in serum cholesterol concentrations among men threatened with unemployment (437 / 976; 44. 8 %) than among those who were not. In stepwise regression analysis the change in serum cholesterol concentration was correlated with changes in haemoglobin concentration, body weight, and serum triglyceride and calcium concentrations. A positive correlation was found between change in cholesterol concentration and change in blood pressure, indicating that the overall risk profile had worsened among men with increased serum cholesterol concentrations. CONCLUSIONS [...] Risk of unemployment increases the serum cholesterol concentration in middle aged men, the increase being more pronounced in those with sleep disturbance. The increase in serum cholesterol is related to changes in other established risk factors for cardiovascular disease. These findings might partly explain the excessive mortality due to cardiovascular disease recorded among the unemployed and people with sleep disturbance...|$|E
