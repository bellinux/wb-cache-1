5|$|After the 1953 armistice, {{the defense}} of the Korean Demilitarized Zone was handled by the South Korean and American armies. The eastern half of the border was handled by the South Korean Army while I Corps took <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west. For the next 18 years, the corps oversaw US forces on the DMZ, seeing only {{occasional}} incidents with the North Korean army. In 1971, under Nixon's détente policy, the 7th Infantry Division was withdrawn, leaving the 2nd Infantry Division as the only US Army unit in Korea. I Corps remained in Korea as a two-division formation until 1972 when it was reduced to zero strength and was replaced in 1982 by the Third Republic of Korea Army (TROKA).|$|E
5|$|Although the State Arms {{were granted}} in 1969, {{municipal}} heraldry {{had already been}} using the black swan symbolism since 1926, when the coat of arms of Perth were granted with a black swan as a <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first quarter and black swan supporters. This was followed by Northam (1953, black swan crest) and Bunbury (1959, black swan crest). Following the grant of the State Arms, municipal arms continued this tradition: Fremantle (1971, charge), Gosnells (1978, charge), Melville (1981, supporters) and Subiaco (1984, crest). All of the municipal arms granted by the Crown have included a representation of a black swan, presumably acknowledging the allegiance of each municipality to the state.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} by quantum chromodynamics, {{the strong interaction between}} quarks is mediated by gluons, massless vector gauge bosons. Each gluon carries one color charge and one anticolor <b>charge.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> standard framework of particle interactions (part {{of a more}} general formulation known as perturbation theory), gluons are constantly exchanged between quarks through a virtual emission and absorption process. When a gluon is transferred between quarks, a color change occurs in both; for example, if a red quark emits a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes green, and if a green quark absorbs a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes red. Therefore, while each quark's color constantly changes, their strong interaction is preserved.|$|E

5|$|At Issus in 333BC, {{his first}} {{confrontation}} with Darius, {{he used the}} same deployment, and again the central phalanx pushed through. Alexander personally led the <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center, routing the opposing army. At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels {{to break up the}} phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes. Alexander arranged a double phalanx, with the center advancing at an angle, parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming. The advance was successful and broke Darius' center, causing the latter to flee once again.|$|E
5|$|Dalglish's {{successor}} Graeme Souness won the FA Cup in {{his first}} full season in <b>charge.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> newly formed Premier League, he struggled to sustain the club's domestic successes, {{and was replaced by}} Roy Evans midway through the 1993–94 season. Liverpool improved to fourth the following season and won the Football League Cup. In 1998, Gérard Houllier was appointed co-manager alongside Evans. The arrangement lasted until November when Evans resigned and Houllier became the sole mananger. The club won a unique treble of trophies in 2001, and a year later finished second to Arsenal, their highest league finish in 11 years. Houllier departed the club in mid-2004.|$|E
5|$|In his ministerial role, Constantine {{promoted}} {{development of}} Trinidad's road, rail, {{water and electricity}} infrastructure. However, in late 1958 {{he was accused of}} corruption, over a ship leasing deal. His angry response to the <b>charge,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Legislative Council, created a perception of arrogance among his colleagues, and suggested that he had not sufficiently adapted to parliamentary politics. According to Mason, the speech was a miscalculation which made the public, perhaps already sceptical of his commitment to Trinidad after so many years away, question his fitness for a ministerial role, a view increasingly held by commentators.|$|E

Jack Taylor was appointed manager, and failed to keep Leeds out of the relegation zone {{by the end of}} the 1959–60 campaign.

5|$|The {{building}} {{marked a}} <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> style of Nonconformist worship locations. Previously these were mostly built with brick, and were plain, with the grander tending towards Greek architecture. Said {{to be the}} first neogothic Nonconformist chapel, Manchester's Unitarian Chapel was preceded by the Congregationalists' Congregational Chapel in March, Cambridgeshire, which was constructed in 1836 and is also in the neogothic style. Chapels built following the construction of these two resembled parish churches more than the former style.|$|E
5|$|Aberdeen signed new co-managers in 1989, pairing Alex Smith and Jocky Scott. A {{number of}} foreign players were signed, {{including}} Dutch internationals Theo Snelders and Hans Gillhaus. In the 1989–90 season, the club won both the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup. In 1991, they lost the last game of the season, and the league title, to Rangers. Former player Willie Miller took over in 1992 and presided over two seasons where Aberdeen came close to winning the title. However, the club ended the 1994–95 season second-bottom, and {{had to rely on}} a play-off victory over Dunfermline Athletic to retain their Premier Division status. Miller was sacked in February 1995, and replaced by Roy Aitken. Despite a Scottish League Cup success in 1995, the club continued to struggle. Alex Miller and Paul Hegarty had spells in <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1990s, but with the financial burden of a new stand putting the club into debt {{for the first time in}} its history, the directors turned to Stewart Milne, a local businessman whose firm had built the stand, to bring business acumen to the running of the club.|$|E

5|$|After regrouping, Carter, Susan and Preacher go to a {{decompression}} {{chamber and}} swim to the surface. Carter {{realizes that the}} sharks made them flood the facility so they could escape through the weaker mesh fences at the surface. In an effort to distract the last shark from escaping to the open sea, Susan cuts herself and dives into the water. Although she manages to distract the shark, she is unable {{to get out of}} the water. Carter dives in, but is too late to save her from being devoured. While Carter is grabbing hold of the shark's dorsal fin, Preacher shoots the shark with a harpoon, but the spear also goes through Carter's thigh. As the shark breaks through the fence, Carter orders Preacher to connect the trailing wire to a battery, sending an electric current through the wire and to an explosive <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> harpoon, killing the shark. In the end, Carter managed to free himself in time, and joins Preacher to see a workers' boat en-route on the horizon.|$|E
5|$|Dietrich {{was tried}} in the County Court of Victoria in 1988 for a {{trafficking}} offence under the Customs Act 1901 and certain less serious charges. During the lengthy trial the accused had no legal representation. Although he had applied to the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria for assistance, {{they said that they}} would only help him if he pleaded guilty, an option which Dietrich did not want to take. He applied to the Supreme Court of Victoria for legal assistance, but was again turned down. Although Dietrich was acquitted of the fourth charge—regarding the possession of a quantity of heroin separate to that which was involved in the first three charges—he was convicted of the principal <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> County Court. Dietrich brought an appeal in the Supreme Court, but that court refused to hear his appeal. He then sought leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Hodgson's {{departure}} from the club in 1989 marked {{the start of a}} 15-year period during which Malmö FF failed to win a league or cup title. Houghton initially returned in Hodgson's place, but the former manager's two-year sojourn back at the club proved largely unsuccessful. He was replaced by Dane Viggo Jensen in July 1992. Jensen returned to Denmark {{at the end of the}} 1993 season, and was succeeded by Rolf Zetterlund, who managed the club between 1994 and 1996. Zetterlund's time at the club was fairly successful as the club finished each of his years in <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> top four league places. Dutchman Frans Thijssen took Zetterlund's place in January 1997, and stayed at the club until August 1998 when he was sacked following poor results in Allsvenskan and European competition. Roland Andersson then managed the club until it was relegated at the end of the 1999 season. As the club had never before been relegated (having only previously been removed from the top division by a punitive demotion), Andersson was sacked. He was replaced by Michael Andersson (no relation), who guided the team to promotion back to Allsvenskan at the first attempt.|$|E

She was the goalkeeper for the United States women's {{national}} {{soccer team}} from 2000 through August 2016.

5|$|On November 28, 1864, about 240 {{members of}} the {{regiment}} completed their 3-year enlistment and mustered out. The regiment was then reorganized into five companies. By the end of 1864, the regiment was part of General George Armstrong Custer's 3rd Division, Cavalry Corps—which, along with another division, remained {{under the command of}} General Sheridan. Sheridan's two cavalry divisions continued to fight in the Shenandoah Valley, and were responsible for eliminating Confederate General Jubal Early's Army of the Valley from the war. During March 1865, Sheridan moved his two divisions eastward toward Petersburg, Virginia. The regiment, as part of Capehart's Fighting Brigade in Custer's division, was part of a crucial cavalry <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Union victory at the Battle of Sailor's Creek. The regiment was also present during the Appomattox Campaign and the surrender of Confederate General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. After the war, the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry participated in the Grand Review of the Armies, and was mustered out on June 30, 1865. Four men from the regiment received the United States of America's highest military award, the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|The Peasants' Revolt {{has been}} widely studied by academics. Late 19th-century historians used a range of sources from {{contemporary}} chroniclers to assemble {{an account of the}} uprising, and these were supplemented in the 20th century by research using court records and local archives. Interpretations of the revolt have shifted over the years. It was once seen as a defining moment in English history, but modern academics are less certain of its impact on subsequent social and economic history. The revolt heavily influenced the course of the Hundred Years' War, by deterring later Parliaments from raising additional taxes to pay for military campaigns in France. The revolt {{has been widely}} used in socialist literature, including by the author William Morris, and remains a potent political symbol for the political left, informing the arguments surrounding the introduction of the Community <b>Charge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom during the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|The Rhine Campaign of 1796 saw Moreau's army {{facing the}} Austrian Army of the Upper Rhine under Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour in the south. Meanwhile, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's French Army of Sambre-et-Meuse opposed the Army of the Lower Rhine under Archduke Charles in the north. Jourdan drubbed Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of Württemberg at Altenkirchen on 4 June, {{compelling}} Archduke Charles {{to rush to}} the rescue with reinforcements. Charles defeated Jourdan at Wetzlar on the 15th, forcing him to pull back {{to the west bank}} of the Rhine. At this time there was a shake up in the high command and the archduke was put in control of both Austrian armies. In Charles' absence, Moreau successfully crossed the Rhine at Kehl on the night of 23–24 June and beat Latour at Rastatt on 5 July. Leaving Wilhelm von Wartensleben in <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north, Charles rushed south to confront Moreau along the Alb River near Ettlingen. After an all-day combat, the Austrians held the advantage on their right wing near Malsch, but the French had defeated their left wing in the Black Forest.|$|E
5|$|William III's {{victory at}} the Battle of the Boyne on 1 July 1690 (O.S.) forced JamesII to abandon his army and flee back to France. In August Marlborough himself left for Ireland engaged upon his first {{independent}} command – a land/sea operation upon the southern ports of Cork and Kinsale. It was a bold, imaginative project aimed at disrupting Jacobite supply routes, and one which the Earl conceived and executed with outstanding success. Cork fell on 27 September (O.S.), and Kinsale followed in mid-October. Although the campaign did not end the war in Ireland as Marlborough hoped, it taught him {{the significance of the}} minutiae of logistics, and the importance of cooperation and tact when working alongside other senior Allied commanders. It would, however, be more than ten years before he once again took <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie {{visit the}} local Quahog bank so that Brian can deposit holiday {{money in his}} safe deposit box. Stewie then {{wants to go to}} a store to return a $3,000 Thom Browne sweater. While they are still inside the vault, the door closes {{at the end of the}} work day and locks them inside until the next morning. Frightened, Stewie soils his diaper. Worried he will get a rash from the dirty diaper, Stewie desperately tries to make Brian eat his feces by {{threatening}} him with a gun that Brian had stored in his deposit box. They discover that Stewie has a cellphone in his pocket, but there's only enough <b>charge</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> battery for one short phone call. Unfortunately, Stewie uses the last of the phone's battery charge to call the clothing store rather than for help. Enraged, Brian hits Stewie, throws his phone on the ground (thus breaking the phone), and yells at Stewie, making him cry. Instantly remorseful and wanting to repair his relationship with Stewie, Brian reluctantly agrees to eat Stewie's feces in order to provide him with a clean diaper and make up for making Stewie cry. While watching Brian eating, Stewie becomes nauseated and throws up; Stewie then convinces Brian to eat his puke, correctly pointing out that Brian likes the taste of vomit. Realizing that he has nothing to clean his bottom with, Stewie manages to convince Brian to clean his bottom with his tongue in order to avoid infection, much to Stewie's pleasure. Afterward, they both decide to take a nap, but soon they realize that the next day is Sunday, meaning that they will have to wait another day before they can be released from the vault.|$|E
