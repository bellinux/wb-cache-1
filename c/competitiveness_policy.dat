40|$|The {{paper is}} an attempt to show the <b>competitiveness</b> {{clusters}} <b>policy</b> as a key element of the new French industrial policy using recent evaluation results of this policy.

Secondly, evaluation results of the French <b>competitiveness</b> clusters <b>policy</b> and a comparison of this instrument to similar ones existing in leading EU countries are provided.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that there is no linear {{economic}} growth of national economies; if it is to address conditioned convergence or club convergence, even for the countries which provide obvious convergence process, they do not actually meet a linear catching up process. This paper is trying to identify the causes of growth limits, namely growth equilibrium traps and to point some exit solutions from these traps, genuinely called leapfrogs. Besides the hazards which might have positive impacts in some cases, as there are Porter’s chances (1990), this paper would look for adequate answers to the questions whether actual <b>competitiveness</b> <b>policies</b> of European Union could eventually leapfrog the middle income trap and if the <b>competitiveness</b> <b>policies</b> are appropriate in order to eliminate structural differences and gaps between the developed countries and those who come from behind...|$|R

40|$|The prime {{concern is}} to {{highlight}} the strategic choice framework (SCF) for analysing localities' economic development and <b>competitiveness</b> <b>policies</b> {{in the context of}} globalisation. The SCF is centred on hypotheses relating to the governance of production, where 'governance' is understood in terms of the processes and associated structures for identifying and making strategic choices. The argument is illustrated from discussions of current realities at micro, meso and macro levels, and from analyses of the potential for 'democratic' development paths. This leads to an explicit focus on <b>competitiveness</b> <b>policies.</b> The conceptualisation of 'competitiveness' is discussed, and we advocate a focus on the degree to which policies serve the democratically determined public interest. The paper's secondary concern is to highlight implications of the SCF for the research agenda. We envisage an emphasis on boundary spanning research. It is suggested that the SCF be applied in the context of experiences in actual localities, in diverse forms of enterprise, and in networking and clusters; and that the SCF be deepened by focusing on aspects of three topics: economic democracy, economic performance and policy evaluation. Strategic choice, governance, economic development, <b>competitiveness,</b> public <b>policies,...</b>|$|R

50|$|According to the <b>Competitiveness</b> <b>Policy</b> Council Sub-council on Trade Policy, {{published}} in 1993, the main recommendation for the incoming Clinton Administration {{was to make}} all aspects of competition a national priority.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} both the EU and the US are {{evolving}} largely similar industrial policy mixes in response {{to change in the}} international political economy. These <b>competitiveness</b> <b>policies</b> blend liberal deregulation with a renewed commitment to government subsidy and support in "key" industrial sectors - especially high-technology industries. The US has thus retreated from the "laissez-faire" policies long associated with it. Europe, long more comfortable with the involvement of the state in economic life, has undertaken deregulation while seeking to develop technology policies...|$|R

40|$|In {{this chapter}} our {{aim is to}} examine the effects on {{cohesion}} of European Union competition and conlpetitiveness policies.

What these measures share is a concern to create a competitive environment and increase the competitiveness of European enterprises. To evaluate them, it is necessary to define competitiveness and explore its relation to cohesion. ...|$|R

The "new developmentalism" is based on domestic finance, balanced public budgets, moderate interest rates and <b>competitiveness</b> <b>policies</b> aimed at neutralizing the tendency to exchange rate overappreciation.

50|$|The private-sector Council on Competitiveness (distinct {{from the}} federal <b>Competitiveness</b> <b>Policy</b> Council) was formed in 1989 to play the same role as the {{previous}} Task Force on Regulatory Relief that Bush had served on in the Reagan administration, which was to negotiate {{on behalf of the}} president for regulatory relief with the heads of federal agencies. This executive branch agency negotiated with EPA director Reilly, leading to industry-favorable rulings such as the redefinition of wetlands and the allowance of untreated toxic chemicals in local landfills (this was later reversed). While previous regulatory-relief efforts, such as Reagan's use of the Office of Budget Management, were subject to congressional oversight, the Council on Competitiveness was independent and wasn't required to keep records of its proceedings.|$|E
50|$|The {{establishment}} of the <b>Competitiveness</b> <b>Policy</b> Council (CPC) was inspired, in part, by the favorable reception to the 1985 Report of the President's Commission on Industrial Competitiveness (chaired by John A. Young). A year following the Young Commission Report, a private sector Council on Competitiveness was set up, which remains in existence. The CPC developed a cooperative relationship with the Council on Competitiveness which enhanced the CPC's work product. The two Councils were easily distinguishable, however, in that {{the membership of the}} federally established CPC included a federal cabinet-level official and s state elected official. Thus, the deliberation of the CPC was able to benefit from the input of governmental members. By contrast, the private-sector Council on Competitiveness lacks governmental members.|$|E
