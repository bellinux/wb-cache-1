5|$|Uranium is more {{plentiful}} than antimony, tin, cadmium, mercury, or silver, and it {{is about}} as abundant as arsenic or molybdenum. Uranium is found in hundreds of minerals, including uraninite (the most common uranium ore), <b>carnotite,</b> autunite, uranophane, torbernite, and coffinite. Significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as phosphate rock deposits, and minerals such as lignite, and monazite sands in uranium-rich ores (it is recovered commercially from sources with as little as 0.1% uranium).|$|E
5|$|Along with <b>carnotite</b> and roscoelite, {{vanadinite}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} industrial ores of the element vanadium, which can be extracted by roasting and smelting. Vanadinite is also occasionally used as a source of lead. A common process for extracting the vanadium begins with the heating of vanadinite with salt (NaCl) or sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) at about 850°C to produce sodium vanadate (NaVO3). This is dissolved in water and then treated with ammonium chloride to give an orange-coloured precipitate of ammonium metavanadate. This is then melted to form a crude form of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5). Reduction of vanadium pentoxide with calcium gives pure vanadium.|$|E
5|$|Most helium on Earth is {{a result}} of {{radioactive}} decay. Helium is found in large amounts in minerals of uranium and thorium, including cleveite, pitchblende, <b>carnotite</b> and monazite, because they emit alpha particles (helium nuclei, He2+) to which electrons immediately combine as soon as the particle is stopped by the rock. In this way an estimated 3000 metric tons of helium are generated per year throughout the lithosphere. in Natural Sources of Helium |journal = Phys. Rev. |volume=74|issue= 11 |pages= 1590–1594 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.74.1590|bibcode = 1948PhRv...74.1590A }} In the Earth's crust, the concentration of helium is 8 parts per billion. In seawater, the concentration is only 4 parts per trillion. There are also small amounts in mineral springs, volcanic gas, and meteoric iron. Because helium is trapped in the subsurface under conditions that also trap natural gas, the greatest natural concentrations of helium on the planet are found in natural gas, from which most commercial helium is extracted. The concentration varies in a broad range from a few ppm to more than 7% in a small gas field in San Juan County, New Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Radioactivity {{is a rare}} property; {{minerals}} may {{be composed}} of radioactive elements. They could be a defining constituent, such as uranium in uraninite, autunite, and <b>carnotite,</b> or as trace impurities. In the latter case, the decay of a radioactive element damages the mineral crystal; the result, termed a radioactive halo or pleochroic halo, is observable by various techniques, such as thin-section petrography.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of an Austrian monopoly and the strong urge of other countries {{to have access to}} radium led to a worldwide search for uranium ores. The United States took over as leading producer in the early 1910s. The <b>Carnotite</b> sands in Colorado provide some of the element, but richer ores are found in the Congo and the area of the Great Bear Lake and the Great Slave Lake of northwestern Canada. Neither of the deposits is mined for radium but the uranium content makes mining profitable.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, uranium ore was {{recovered}} as {{a byproduct of}} mining in Saxony, Bohemia, and Cornwall. The first deliberate mining of radioactive ores took place in Jáchymov, a silver-mining city in the Czech Republic. Marie Curie used pitchblende ore from Jáchymov to isolate the element radium, a decay product of uranium. Until World War II uranium was mined primarily for its radium content; some <b>carnotite</b> deposits were mined primarily for the vanadium content. Sources for radium, contained in the uranium ore, were sought for use as luminous paint for watch dials and other instruments, {{as well as for}} health-related applications, some of which in retrospect were certainly harmful. The byproduct uranium was used mostly as a yellow pigment.|$|E
500|$|Petrified {{wood and}} fossils of animals adapted to swampy environments, such as phytosaurs, lungfish, and {{lacustrine}} bivalves, {{have been found}} in this formation as well as conifer trees, cycads, ferns, and horsetails. Relatively plentiful uranium ore, such as <b>carnotite</b> and other uranium-bearing minerals, has also been found. The purple, pink, blue, white, yellow, gray, and red colored Chinle also contains shale, gypsum, limestone, sandstone, and quartz. Iron, manganese oxides and copper sulfide are often found filling gaps between pebbles. [...] Purplish slopes made of the Chinle can be seen above the town of Rockville.|$|E
500|$|Vanadium is the 20th most {{abundant}} {{element in the}} earth's crust; metallic vanadium is rare in nature (known as the mineral vanadium, native vanadium), but vanadium compounds occur naturally in about 65 different minerals. Economically significant examples include patronite (VS4), vanadinite (...) , and <b>carnotite</b> (...) [...] Much of the world's vanadium production is sourced from vanadium-bearing magnetite found in ultramafic gabbro bodies. Vanadium is mined mostly in South Africa, north-western China, and eastern Russia. In 2013 these three countries mined more than 97% of the 79,000 tonnes of produced vanadium.|$|E
500|$|Thorium and uranium are {{the most}} {{abundant}} actinides in nature with the respective mass concentrations of 16ppm and 4ppm. Uranium mostly occurs in the Earth's crust as a mixture of its oxides in the minerals uraninite, which is also called pitchblende because of its black color. There are several dozens of other [...] such as <b>carnotite</b> (KUO2VO4·3H2O) and autunite (Ca(UO2)2(PO4)2·nH2O). The isotopic composition of natural uranium is 238U (relative abundance 99.2742%), 235U (0.7204%) and 234U (0.0054%); of these 238U has the largest half-life of 4.51 years. The worldwide production of uranium in 2009 amounted to 50,572 tonnes, of which 27.3% was mined in Kazakhstan. Other important uranium mining countries are Canada (20.1%), Australia (15.7%), Namibia (9.1%), Russia (7.0%), and Niger (6.4%).|$|E
2500|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1914 in New York City, by Dr. Sabin Arnold von Sochocky and Dr. George S. Willis, as the Radium Luminous Material Corporation. The company {{produced}} uranium from <b>carnotite</b> ore and eventually moved {{into the business of}} producing radioluminescent paint, and then to the application of that paint. Over the next several years, it opened facilities in Newark, Jersey City, and Orange. In August 1921, von Sochocky was forced from the presidency, and the company was renamed the United States Radium Corporation. In Orange, where radium was extracted from 1917 to 1926, the U.S. Radium facility processed half a ton of ore per day. The ore was obtained from [...] "Undark mines" [...] in Paradox Valley, Colorado and in Utah.|$|E
5000|$|Although radium {{had been}} {{discovered}} in 1898, it had been derived from pitchblende, and the radium content of <b>carnotite</b> was not known. <b>Carnotite</b> was suspected to contain radium as early as 1903, {{on the basis of}} the anomalously high radioactivity of <b>carnotite</b> ores. [...] But it was not until 1911 that the radium content of <b>carnotite</b> was confirmed by the Marie Curie laboratory in Paris. [...] Although no more than a trace of radium was present in the ore, newly discovered medical applications had made radium worth $100 per milligram, making the radium in the <b>carnotite</b> ore worth much more than the vanadium or uranium.|$|E

50|$|Once <b>carnotite</b> {{was known}} to contain radium, prospectors rushed to the Colorado Plateau of {{southwest}} Colorado and adjacent southeast Utah, and found carnotite-bearing sandstones of the Jurassic Morrison Formation in Mesa, Montrose, and San Miguel counties in Colorado. The <b>carnotite</b> was at first shipped to Europe for processing, but by 1913, the Standard Chemical Company had built a radium processing plant in Montrose County that had become the world’s largest supplier of radium.|$|E

50|$|Uranium mining in Arizona {{has taken}} place since 1918. Prior to the uranium boom of the late 1940s, uranium in Arizona was a {{byproduct}} of vanadium mining of the mineral <b>carnotite.</b>|$|E

50|$|In the Little Mountain mining {{district}} {{on the west}} side of the Bighorn Mountains, Big Horn County, Wyoming, uranium was produced from 1955 to 1970 from paleokarst breccias in the Madison Limestone of Mississippian age. The uranium occurs as <b>carnotite</b> and tyuyamunite.|$|E
