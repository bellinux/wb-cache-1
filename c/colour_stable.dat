30|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the effects of transparent and pigmented vegetable oils on the colour stability of selected tropical woods at their natural and artificial weathering. The colour changes of tested tropical wood species in the outdoor exposition in the Central European climate conditions were already highly significant after 6  months. The most <b>colour</b> <b>stable</b> wood species was bangkirai, without or with oil treatment.|$|E
30|$|Generally, of the tested {{tropical}} woods, bangkirai {{wood was}} the most <b>colour</b> <b>stable</b> in both cases, i.e. natural and with oil finishes. In Xenotest, it was always resistant to colour changes independently {{if it was not}} treated (see ΔE* in Fig.  1), or was treated with transparent or pigmented oils (see ΔE* in Figs.  2, 3, 4). In outdoor areas, it had good long-term colour stability after treatment with teak pigmented oil (see ΔE* in Fig.  3).|$|E
30|$|The lesser {{influence}} {{of tropical wood}} species on their colour changes in the initial period of exposure was observed in more works [25, 30, 31]. Similarly, in our work, oil finish in the bangkirai shade had a more positive effect on massaranduba wood. On the other hand, more <b>colour</b> <b>stable</b> for other wood species (bangkirai, kusia, jatoba) was oil finish with the teak shade. A possible explanation for this observation is that the specific type and content of different extractives in massaranduba wood influenced the colour change of the pigment in the used oil. Effect of different species of tropical woods on their colour stability after treatment with pigmented paints was also found in other works [19, 24, 25].|$|E
30|$|Using oil paints, {{the colour}} change of treated wood can be mitigated, {{especially}} using pigmented ones. To achieve <b>stable</b> <b>colours</b> of oiled wood surfaces, {{they must be}} renewed frequently, optimally within 6 – 12  months.|$|R

Baar and Gryc [27] observed a higher colour change in jatobá than in massaranduba wood, but only when using shorter UV exposure time in Xenotest (for 144  h), and without water spraying. A lower colour stability of native jatobá {{in comparison with the}} native massaranduba wood was also found in this work, both for natural and artificial weathering (see ΔE* was 25.1 for jatobá and 19.4 for massaranduba after 36  months of natural weathering and ΔE* was 31.9 for jatobá and 22.5 for massaranduba after 12  weeks of artificial weathering in Fig.  1). The colour stability of the most dense woods, bangkirai and massaranduba, was a comparable in the exterior, while bangkirai was more stable in Xenotest.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of computerised tomography imaging (CT scan), for carcase composition determination, on the oxy/metmyoglobin ratio, hue and L∗, a∗ and b∗ scores of M. longissimus dorsi from both beef and lamb. Beef and lamb M. longissimus dorsi were divided into four proportions and randomly allocated {{to one of the}} following treatments; CT 30 day aged; CT fresh; control 30 day aged; control fresh. Colour measurements were made over a 96 h retail display period. CT scan had little effect on the colour of both lamb and beef across all colour parameters. There was a small negative affect observed in CT aged samples (P < 0. 05) for ratio, hue, a∗ and b∗ values, however these differences were so small that they are unlikely to impact upon the commercial shelf-life of the product. Other factors such as aging, species and vitamin E concentration play a much greater role in colour stability than CT. Aged M. longissimus dorsi clearly had a worse colour stability than the fresh packaged samples, while beef was a lot more <b>colour</b> <b>stable</b> than lamb. It appears that CT scan for the purpose of body composition determination will not have any commercially relevant impact on colour stability of both beef and lamb...|$|E
40|$|This study {{concerns}} the isolation, characterisation and physio-chemical properties of 8, 8 -methylmethine-(epi) catechin-malvidin- 3 -glucoside compounds found in red wines. 8, 8 -Methylmethine-(epi) catechin-malvidin- 3 -glucoside compounds were isolated via chromatographic methods developed in this study. The compounds were characterised via {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} spectrometry which, {{with the aid of}} molecular modelling, afforded their possible 3 -dimensional structures. Their physio-chemical properties including ionisation and hydration constants, colour parameters and chemical stabilities were determined. The formation of 8, 8 -methylmethine-flavan- 3 -ol-malvidin- 3 -glucoside compounds and other pigments in wines was also studied. 8, 8 -Methylmethine-(epi) catechin-malvidin- 3 -glucoside compounds were also synthesised by condensing malvidin- 3 -glucoside with (epi) catechin in the presence of acetaldehyde. Diastereomers of 8, 8 -methylmethine-(epi) catechin-malvidin- 3 -glucoside pigments were isolated from the reaction using size-exclusion liquid chromatography followed by cation-exchange liquid chromatography. The structures of the four 8, 8 -methylmethine-catechin (and epicatechin) -malvidin- 3 -glucoside diastereomers were determined using mass spectrometry and one and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. It was found that for all four compounds, the methylmethine bridge occurs at the 8 -positions of malvidin- 3 -glucoside and (epi) catechin and that the 3 -dimensional structural differences between the diastereomers is the positioning of the (epi) catechin moiety with respect to the glucoside group. One diastereomer has the (epi) catechin on the same side, with respect to the malvidin entity whilst it is on the opposite side for the other diastereomer. The proposed structures also afforded the malvidin entity protection from nucleophilic attack via steric hindrance by the (epi) catechin moiety. 8, 8 -Methylmethine-(epi) catechin-malvidin- 3 -glucoside pigments have greater colour stability with regards to changes in pH and SO 2 bleaching compared to malvidin- 3 -glucoside providing evidence that little or no hydration in aqueous solutions is occurring for these compounds. Further evidence for little or no hydration occurring is the presence of isosbestic points in the UV-vis spectra observed for the 8, 8 -methylmethine-(epi) catechin-malvidin- 3 -glucoside in the pH range 2 to 7. Although the 8, 8 -methylmethine-(epi) catechin-malvidin- 3 -glucoside pigments have greater colour stability to pH, SO 2 and oxidation, compared to malvidin- 3 -glucoside, they have lower temporal stabilities and under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions they have significantly higher degradation rate constants than malvidin- 3 -glucoside. The ionisation constants of the 8, 8 -methylmethine-(epi) catechin-malvidin- 3 -glucoside compounds were determined using high voltage paper electrophoresis (HVPE) and UV-visible spectroscopy. The first ionisation constants (pKa 1) of the 8, 8 -methylmethine-(epi) catechin-malvidin- 3 -glucoside compounds were found to be higher than that of malvidin- 3 -glucoside whereas the second and third ionisation constants (pKa 2 and pKa 3) were found to be lower. The correlation of the ionisation constants between HVPE and UV-visible spectroscopy supports the proposal that {{there is little or no}} occurrence of hydration for the 8, 8 -methylmethine-(epi) catechin-malvidin- 3 -glucoside compounds in the pH range investigated. 8, 8 -Methylmethine-flavan- 3 -ol-malvidin- 3 -glucoside compounds were the major pigments formed during fermentations of chemically defined grape juice media containing malvidin- 3 -glucoside and various flavan- 3 -ols. The yeast strain used for fermentation had a major influence on the levels and rates of formation of these pigments during fermentation. The yeast strain used also has an important influence on wine pigment composition, concentration and evolution during maturation thereby affecting the colour density and hue of the resultant wines. The initial formation of 8, 8 -methylmethine-flavan- 3 -ol-malvidin- 3 -glucoside compounds and their subsequent gradual degradation during maturation, allowed a pool of malvidin- 3 -glucoside to be available for the formation of other <b>colour</b> <b>stable</b> and more temporally stable pigments.

This approxmiate constancy of colours is not straightforward, as the spectra of the light reflected towards the eye can change considerably with the spectrum of the illummation. Therefore, the three photoreceptors in the eye respond differently to the different spectra reflected by the same surface under different ihuminants. Nevertheless, for a given scene, patterns of receptor responses under different illuminants are intrinsically mterrelated, and the Strength of these interrelations allow for the generation of approximately illuminantinvariant surface-colour codings.
