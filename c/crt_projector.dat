50|$|<b>CRT</b> <b>projector</b> using {{cathode ray}} tubes. This {{typically}} involves a blue, a green, {{and a red}} tube. This is the oldest system still in regular use, but falling out of favor {{largely because of the}} bulky cabinet. However, it does provide the largest screen size for a given cost. This also covers three-tube home models which, while bulky, can be moved (but then usually require complex picture adjustments to get the three images to line up correctly).|$|E
5000|$|Though systems {{utilizing}} projected video at {{one time}} almost exclusively used CRT projectors, they have largely been replaced by other technologies such as LCD projection and Digital Light Processing. Improvements in these digital video projectors, and their subsequent increased availability and desirability, resulted in a drastic decline of <b>CRT</b> <b>projector</b> sales by the early 2000s. As of 2012, very few (if any) new units are manufactured, though a number of installers do sell refurbished units, generally higher-end 8" [...] and 9" [...] models.|$|E
50|$|<b>CRT</b> <b>projectors</b> {{are both}} {{considerably}} larger and heavier than comparable LCD and DLP projectors.|$|R
50|$|<b>CRT</b> <b>projectors</b> do {{not show}} a Rainbow effect seen with single chip DLP projectors.|$|R
50|$|<b>CRT</b> <b>projectors</b> {{use more}} power / cost more to run than LCD and DLP units.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>CRT</b> <b>{{projector}}</b> is a {{video projector}} {{that uses a}} small, high-brightness cathode ray tube as the image generating element. The image is then focused and enlarged onto a screen using a lens kept {{in front of the}} CRT face. The first color CRT projectors came out in the early 1950s. Most modern CRT projectors are color and have three separate CRTs (instead of a single, color CRT), and their own lenses to achieve color images. The red, green and blue portions of the incoming video signal are processed and sent to the respective CRTs whose images are focused by their lenses to achieve the overall picture on the screen. Various designs have made it to production, including the [...] "direct" [...] CRT-lens design, and the Schmidt-CRT, which employed a phosphor screen that illuminates a perforated spherical mirror, all within an evacuated [...] "tube." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>CRT</b> <b>projectors</b> require {{far more}} time {{to set up and}} adjust than LCD and DLP based projectors.|$|R
50|$|Absolute ANSI {{brightness}} achievable with <b>CRT</b> <b>projectors</b> {{is lower}} than with comparable lamp-powered LCD and DLP projectors.|$|R

50|$|Low-end or poorly tuned <b>CRT</b> <b>projectors</b> {{may suffer}} from color {{divergence}} or geometric distortion (for example, straight lines {{may not always}} appear completely straight, especially near the corners).|$|R
50|$|Unlike LCD or DLP <b>projectors,</b> <b>CRT</b> <b>projectors</b> are {{somewhat}} prone to burn-in. This {{can lead to}} issues in brightness uniformity on projectors that frequently use both a full 4:3 and widescreen aspect ratio.|$|R
5000|$|High-end <b>CRT</b> <b>projectors</b> can {{precisely}} display images up to 1920 x 1200 [...] with accurate color reproduction. A few projectors can scan at {{even higher}} resolutions up to 3200 x 2560, although {{their ability to}} resolve fine detail at this resolution is greatly reduced.|$|R
5000|$|Peak lumens is {{a measure}} of light output {{normally}} used with <b>CRT</b> video <b>projectors.</b> The testing uses a test pattern typically at either 10 and 20 percent of the image area as white {{at the center of the}} screen, the rest as black. The light output is measured just in this center area. Limitations with <b>CRT</b> video <b>projectors</b> result in them producing greater brightness when just a fraction of the image content is at peak brightness. For example, the Sony VPH-G70Q <b>CRT</b> video <b>projector</b> produces 1200 [...] "peak" [...] lumens but just 200 ANSI lumens.|$|R

50|$|The 767-400ER fleet {{initially}} featured LCDs {{over the}} aisles, but were replaced in 2009 by the Panasonic eFX AVOD system {{when the last}} of the 767-400ERs were converted from domestic to international use. <b>CRT</b> <b>projectors</b> were originally featured in economy class on Boeing 767-300s, with the international 767-300ERs also featuring ceiling-mounted CRT displays over the aisles, which have since replaced by LCD monitors, and are {{now in the process of}} being converted to the eFX2 AVOD system.|$|R
50|$|Runco International was {{incorporated}} in 1987 and launched the Runco International HT (Home Theater) video projector. The company later added significant performance enhancements and features to better accommodate the growing video market for home theater enthusiasts and its dealers. As the home theater market expanded, the company acquired additional brands within {{the consumer electronics}} custom installation channel, including {{the purchase of the}} Vidikron video display brand. By the early 1990s, Runco International had expanded its corporate offices in California, and developed worldwide distribution. It had become a popular brand of <b>CRT</b> <b>projectors,</b> selling models produced by other manufacturers such as Zenith Electronics, NEC, and Barco modified for greater home theater suitability.|$|R
5000|$|Gene Dolgoff began {{thinking}} about {{different types of}} projectors in college in 1968 {{as a way to}} produce a video projector that would be brighter than the then-available <b>CRT</b> <b>projectors.</b> The idea was to use elements referred to as [...] "light valves" [...] to regulate the amount of light that passes through it, such as in traditional slide projectors. This would allow the use of a very powerful external light source. After looking at many different materials, he thought that liquid crystals would allow to modulate the light as planned. However, direct-driven, matrix-addressed LCDs with sufficient resolution for video images were not available at the time, so that Dolgoff could not yet do experiments.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two kinds}} of {{displays}} on the market today: those which [...] "flash" [...] a picture for a short part of the refresh period (<b>CRT,</b> cinema <b>projector),</b> and those which display an essentially static image between the moments of refreshing it (LCD, DLP).|$|R
50|$|In 1991 {{the company}} {{created the first}} {{professional}} grade line doubler (480p) (deinterlacer) which incorporated this technology, for use with large <b>CRT</b> <b>projectors</b> used in Hollywood screening rooms and large home theaters. The highly acclaimed LD1 Line Doubler takes standard definition signals and converts them to higher resolutions with improved image quality, free of the usual NTSC artifacts (cross-color and cross luminance). At the same time, Faroudja started manufacturing products {{based on the same}} technologies, including adaptive comb filters and video quality improvement products for use with Sony’s U-Matic video recorders. This technology was a key factor in the growth of the home theater industry. Faroudja’s adaptive comb filter technology was recognized with a Technology & Engineering Emmy Award in 1991.|$|R
50|$|The William M. Staerkel Planetarium uses a {{specialized}} automation computer, the MC-10 Media Controller, to automate shows using programmable disks. The MC-10 Media Controller can operate either independently or {{in conjunction with}} audio tapes. The Staerkel Planetarium's sound system includes a recording studio and a playback system made up of twelve speakers and two sub-bass enclosures located behind the projection dome. The Staerkel Planetarium has the capability of showing 35mm films and can project an image over {{more than one-third of}} the dome surface area. And, in addition to the star projector at the center of the theatre, the planetarium uses 57 carousel slide projectors that can show panoramas to cover the entire dome as well as three <b>CRT</b> <b>projectors</b> which allow for the projection of videos and special effects.|$|R
50|$|Simple Eidophors {{produced}} black-and-white images. Later {{units used}} a color wheel (equivalent {{to the color}} television standard CBS tried {{to bring to the}} market against RCA/NBC's FCC-approved NTSC system, and today's DLP projection system) to produce red, green, and blue fields. The last models produced used separate red, green, and blue units in a single case. The Eidophor was eighty times brighter than <b>CRT</b> <b>projectors</b> of the time. The last Eidophors were able to project colour images of up to 18 metres in width. Advances in projection television technology in the 1990s brought {{about the end of the}} Eidophor. The new devices were smaller and cheaper and produced comparable results. Current technologies include the Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) and Digital Light Processing (DLP) projectors, both of which produce superior results from easily portable devices.|$|R
40|$|A scalable, {{high-resolution}} display may {{be constructed}} by tiling many projected images over a single display surface. One fundamental challenge {{for such a}} display is to avoid visible seams due to misalignment among the projectors. Traditional methods for avoiding seams involve sophisticated mechanical devices and expensive <b>CRT</b> <b>projectors,</b> coupled with extensive human effort for fine-tuning the projectors. This paper describes an automatic alignment method that relies on an inexpensive, uncalibrated camera to measure the relative mismatches between neighboring projectors, and then correct the projected imagery to avoid seams without significant human effort.

5000|$|For the 1992 Winter Olympics and 1992 Summer Olympics, {{a public}} {{demonstration}} of HD-MAC broadcasting took place. 60 HD-MAC receivers for the Albertville games and 700 for the Barcelona games {{were set up}} in [...] "Eurosites" [...] to show {{the capabilities of the}} standard. (1250) 1152 lines <b>CRT</b> Video <b>projectors</b> were used to create an image a few meters wide. There were some Thomson [...] "Space system" [...] 16/9 CRT TV sets as well. The project sometimes used Rear-projection televisions. In addition, some 80,000 viewers of D2-MAC receivers were also able to watch the channel (though not in HD). It is estimated that 350,000 people across Europe were able to see this demonstration of European HDTV. This project was financed by the EEC. The PAL-converted signal was used by mainstream broadcasters such as SWR, BR et 3Sat.|$|R
50|$|In 1972, John A. Pollock, {{grandson}} {{of the company}} founder, became the third generation president of Electrohome. By this time Electrohome was widely known as the Canadian equivalent of US companies like General Electric or RCA. Pollock led the company {{into a number of}} different electronics ventures and products, both consumer and industrial. Electrohome's most successful products during this period were a line of display projectors that evolved from single <b>CRT</b> monochrome data <b>projectors</b> into stereoscopic virtual reality projectors and digital movie theater projectors, based on the Texas Instruments Digital Light Processing technology.|$|R
50|$|Home theater {{designs and}} layouts are a {{personal}} choice {{and the type}} of home cinema a user can set up depends on her/his budget and the space which is available within the home. The minimum set of requirements for a home theater are: a large television set or good quality video <b>projector</b> <b>CRT</b> (no new models sold in U.S.), LCD, Digital Light Processing (DLP), plasma display, organic light-emitting diode (OLED), Silicon X-tal Reflective Display (SXRD), Laser TV, rear-projection TV, video projector, Standard-definition television (SDTV), HDTV, or 3D-TV at least 27 inches (69 cm) measured diagonally, an AV receiver or pre-amplifier (surround processor) and amplifier combination capable of at least stereo sound but preferably 5.1 Channel Dolby Digital and DTS audio, and something that plays or broadcasts movies in at least stereo sound such as a VHS HI-FI VCR, LaserDisc player (no new stand-alone models of either are available; VHS VCRs are usually bundled in combo decks with DVD players), a DVD player, a Blu-ray disc player, cable or satellite receiver, video game console, etc. Finally a set of speakers, at least two, are needed but more common are anywhere from six to eight with a subwoofer for bass or low-frequency effects.|$|R
50|$|In 1972, {{he succeeded}} his father Carl A. Pollock as {{president}} of Electrohome, a Kitchener, Ontario-based electronics company founded by his grandfather Arthur Bell Pollock in 1907. Electrohome was widely known as the Canadian equivalent of US companies like General Electric and RCA. Pollock led the company into developing {{a number of different}} electronics products, both consumer and industrial, including specialized data displays for the New York Stock Exchange, large-screen projection televisions, reverse osmosis/ultrafiltration systems, and in the late 1970s and 1980s, custom monitors for many leading video games manufacturers including Atari and Sega. The company also had brief ventures in satellite television receivers and videotex hardware. In 1996 Pollock merged the Electrohome owned CKCO-TV, the first TV station in Kitchener-Waterloo, the company's other broadcasting properties, and holdings in CTV, with Baton Broadcasting. In 1997, Electrohome sold its interest in CTV and all broadcast holdings to Baton for cash and shares worth $270 Million Canadian dollars. Baton changed its name to CTV Television Network a year later, and has been the top rated Canadian television network since 2002. Under Pollock, Electrohome's most successful products were a line of industrial display projectors that evolved from single <b>CRT</b> monochrome data <b>projectors</b> into stereoscopic virtual reality projectors and digital movie theater projectors, based on the Texas Instruments Digital Light Processing technology. In 1999, Electrohome sold the projection systems division to Christie Digital, a leading film projector manufacturer. Electrohome eventually was dissolved in an orderly wind down in late 2008.|$|R
