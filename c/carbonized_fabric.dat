2500|$|The oldest {{records of}} flat woven kilims come from Çatalhöyük Neolithic pottery, circa 7000 B.C. One {{of the oldest}} {{settlements}} ever to have been discovered, Çatalhöyük is located south east of Konya {{in the middle of}} the Anatolian region. [...] The excavations to date (only 3% of the town) not only found <b>carbonized</b> <b>fabric</b> but also fragments of kilims painted on the walls of some of the dwellings. The majority of them represent geometric and stylized forms that are similar or identical to other historical and contemporary designs.|$|E
30|$|SEM {{images of}} the ancient <b>{{carbonized}}</b> silk <b>fabrics</b> fibres and artificially carbonized silk samples before and after treatment by the superoxide Dismutase (SOD) were observed with a JEOL JSM- 6700 F scanning electron microscope at 5.0 keV accelerating voltage. Samples were mounted on an aluminum stub and sputtered with aurum before observed.|$|R
50|$|From 2000 to today, Park has {{completed}} {{a series of}} acquisitions and expansions {{all around the world}} and entered the aerospace market. It sold its Nelco Technology Inc. and acquired Nova Composites, Inc. In 2003, Park and Snecma Propulsion Systems signed an agreement to let Park market SPS’s Raycarb C2 <b>carbonized</b> rayon <b>fabric</b> to manufacturers of rocket motors.|$|R
30|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{demonstrate}} the capability of SOD as a potential radical scavenger for ancient silk fabrics. Because genuine historic silk fabrics were not appropriate for {{a large number of}} repeated tests, artificially carbonized silk samples were used as substitutes. To determine the optimal experimental conditions, variance analysis of double factors cross classification without repetition was performed. The scavenging effects were characterized by EPR. The ageing resistance of the scavenged samples was evaluated via dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Then, the method was applied to ancient <b>carbonized</b> silk <b>fabrics.</b> The fibre morphology of samples before and after treatment were observed using scanning electron microscope (SEM).|$|R
30|$|The newly-discovered carbon {{radicals}} in silk can be {{an adverse}} factor related {{to the preservation of}} silk artifacts. Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) was used to scavenge carbon radicals in ancient and artificially <b>carbonized</b> silk <b>fabrics.</b> The experimental conditions of this treatment were determined through variance analysis. It was found that the fresh carbon radicals generated during storage can be effectively scavenged through this method. In addition, the ageing effects of the treated samples and SEM images of samples before and after treatment suggest that this treatment would not accelerate the ageing of silk fabrics. Therefore, the candidacy of SOD as a candidate scavenger of carbon radicals for ancient carbonized silk was demonstrated preliminarily.|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of carbon fibers and fabrics (CF) for producing rocket nozzles is discussed. These materials which {{are essential for}} fabricating the carbon composites used in aerospace systems gasify when exposed to high temperatures and the mechanical properties of the composites degrade. The oxidation kinetics under isothermal (IC) and non-isothermal (NIC) conditions are examined and a comparison is made between the characteristics of IC and NIC oxidation. Several CF, chars, and carbon blacks were examined, including a microporous char, a graphitized rayon <b>fabric,</b> and several <b>carbonized</b> rayon <b>fabrics.</b> A summary is given of the advantages and drawbacks of isothermal and non-isothermal oxidation of carbons. The proceedings are assembled {{in the form of}} a roundtable discussion...|$|R
30|$|Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) was {{proposed}} {{as a potential}} scavenger of carbon radicals in ancient <b>carbonized</b> silk <b>fabrics.</b> Ancient and artificially carbonized silk samples were treated using this method. The optimal experimental conditions of the treatment were determined by variance analysis. The effects of the scavenging on carbonized silks were investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The {{results showed that the}} carbon radicals in both ancient and artificially carbonized silks were cleared to a great extent. The ageing resistance of the treated samples and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of samples before and after treatment ensured that the treatment would not aggravate the deterioration of silk. Thus, the potential of SOD to scavenge carbon radicals in historic silk was demonstrated. Our research may help to alleviate further degradation which could occur during preservation of silk.|$|R
50|$|The first {{appearance}} of a ceramic type that can clearly be classified as bucchero occurred around 675 BCE at the coastal community of Caere (the modern-day Cerveteri), with somewhat later centers of production to be found at Veii and Tarquinia, both cities, like Caere, located {{in the southern part}} of the Etruscan heartland. Bucchero ware would seem to have been the natural sequel to the impasto pottery associated with the earlier Villanovan culture from which the Etruscan civilization, itself, had evolved. Etruscan pottery is distinguished from Villanovan impasto by the more sophisticated processing of the clays used which were finely levigated to remove the traces of grit common in the earlier pottery, by its being uniformly turned on a potter's wheel, by its <b>carbonized</b> black <b>fabric</b> in contrast to the brown or tan color found in impasto pottery.|$|R
