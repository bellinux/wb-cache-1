5|$|For the U.S. Air Force, {{this success}} was {{achieved}} by conducting a shoestring operation, one that was fourth in priority for American air assets behind operations in South Vietnam, Operation Rolling Thunder, and Steel Tiger. After the <b>close-out</b> of aerial operations over North Vietnam, Barrel Roll still remained in last place. During its existence the campaign had utilized an average of only {{ten percent of the}} Air Force's tactical air effort in Southeast Asia. During the 1972 Nguyen Hue PAVN offensive, the number of airstrikes over northern Laos was reduced to only five percent of the total.|$|E
25|$|Guenter Wendt was a McDonnell {{engineer}} who supervised launch preparations {{for both the}} Mercury and Gemini programs and {{would go on to}} do the same when the Apollo program launched crews. His team was responsible for completion of the complex pad <b>close-out</b> procedures just prior to spacecraft launch, and he was the last person the astronauts would see prior to closing the hatch. The astronauts appreciated his taking absolute authority over, and responsibility for, the condition of the spacecraft and developed a good-humored rapport with him.|$|E
25|$|The {{mission of}} the Ground Studies Group was to support the sensor-driven Operation Commando Hunt, which saw the rapid {{expansion}} of the bombing of the Ho Chi Minh Trail. This was made possible by the <b>close-out</b> of Rolling Thunder, which freed up hundreds of aircraft for interdiction missions. Intelligence for the campaign was supplied by both the recon teams of MACSOG and by the strings of air-dropped electronic sensors of Operation Igloo White (the successor to Muscle Shoals), controlled from Nakhon Phanom. 1969 saw the apogee of the bombing campaign, when 433,000 tons of bombs were dropped on Laos. SOG supported the effort with ground reconnaissance, sensor emplacement, wiretap, and bomb damage assessment missions. The cessation of the bombing of the north also freed the North Vietnamese to reinforce their anti-aircraft defenses of the trail system and aircraft losses rose proportionately.|$|E

40|$|This {{project was}} {{canceled}} shortly after final approval. Thus, {{there are no}} accomplishments. The major problem encountered was the extreme effort required to obtain approval (about two years) to start work. No lessons were learned. No <b>close-outs</b> items require addressing. No contracts were let. Only two commitments were scheduled to be completed before the Y- 12 cancellation: both involved the industrial partners: (1) the industrial partners were to define the preferred sensor power requirements, this was completed and the details are treated as proprietary or CRADA-Protected Information; (2) the industrial partners were to perform a physical integration assessment of sensor technologies and the details are treated as proprietary or CRADA-Protected Information...|$|R
500|$|As many as 43,000 North Vietnamese or Laotians (most of {{whom were}} pressed into service) were engaged in operating, improving, or {{extending}} the system. In 1969, 433,000 tonnes of ordnance fell on Laos. This {{was made possible by}} the <b>close-out</b> of [...] "Operation Rolling Thunder" [...] and the commencement of [...] "Operation Commando Hunt" [...] in November 1968. U.S. aircraft were freed for interdiction missions and as many as 500 per day were flying over Laos.

Current fusion welding methods of Al [...] Cu [...] Li have produced welds containing varied defects. These areas are found by non-destructive examination both after welding and after proof testing. Current techniques for repairing typically small (< 0. 25) defects weaken the weldment, rely heavily on welders' skill, and are costly. Friction plug welding repairs increase strength, ductility and resistance to cracking over initial weld quality, without requiring much time or operator skill. Friction plug welding while pulling the plug is advantageous because all hardware for performing the weld can be placed {{on one side of}} the workpiece...|$|R
40|$|A 50 kg. {{satellite}} {{is being}} developed at the University of Mexico as an engineering test bed. SATEX- 1 is programmed to be launched to polar orbit early in 1995 by Ariane. The satellite structure comprises aluminum sandwich panels and composites {{in the form of}} a cube made with two matting U-shaped parts. This solution was selected for simplicity during assembly and testing. The s/c body is further stiffened by an internal panel which supports a pressurized gas tank and other hardware. All panels are joined by standard corner and edge <b>close-outs</b> and splices. At present, a finite element model for the validation of the design, regarding static and dynamic behavior is being conducted. The paper presents numerical results for quasi static and dynamic analysis, such as eigen-values, free vibration and sinusoidal vibrations. The testing program follows closely launcher agency requirements and is supported by previous similar experiences in our laboratory. Also, a general description of the project is included...|$|R
40|$|Metal or solid polymer anchors are {{employed}} as the load transfer components for foams and foam composites structures, {{when they are}} used as the structural element in design. The traditional method of fixation of these components is gluing and fastening, typically {{to the surface of}} the foam or composite. In this work, the anchors are in the form of inserts and are imbedded in the foam during the foaming process. Flexural testing was conducted on different metal foam configurations to establish typical interaction trends. The load-deflection response, mode of failure and fracture stresses of the structures are elucidated. Tests were conducted on the foam and foam composites with rectangular, cylindrical, and taper insert geometries with different lengths. Leaf inserts were designed and manufactured. Flexure testing was done on foam and sandwich composite structures with leaf inserts. A linear elastic fracture model was studied, and fracture toughness for the foam beam with inserts was calculated. Finite element analysis (FE) of the interactions between the inserts and the foam structures under different loads were carried out. The FE modeling results coincided with the experimental ones hence validating the model. FE simulations were also run with foams, and sandwich composite structures with <b>close-outs...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Wilbur Snapp {{served as}} Stadium organist from 1982 through 1996. Snapp had run a music store in Springfield, Ohio and retired to Florida in 1978. He played organ for both spring {{training}} and Florida State League games. Snapp received national attention following his ejection from an FSL ballgame in 1985. On June 25, 1985 during a Clearwater Phillies {{game against the}} Osceola Astros, an umpire called a <b>close-out</b> against Clearwater. Snapp agreed with the boos {{of the crowd and}} began playing [...] "Three Blind Mice." [...] The umpire ejected Snapp, the first time an organist was ejected by an umpire during a game. Willard Scott mentioned it on NBC's Today show, and Paul Harvey talked about it on his syndicated radio program.

40|$|In 2007, the NASA Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) {{chartered}} the NASA Engineering Safety Center (NESC) {{to demonstrate}} an alternate launch abort concept as risk mitigation for the Orion project's baseline "tower" design. On July 8, 2009, a full scale, passive aerodynamically stabilized Max Launch Abort System (MLAS) pad abort demonstrator was successfully launched from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Wallops Flight Facility. Aerodynamic <b>close-outs</b> {{were required to}} cover openings on the MLAS fairing to prevent aerodynamic flow-through and to maintain the MLAS OML surface shape. Two-ply duct tape covers were designed to meet these needs. The duct tape used was a high strength fiber reinforced duct tape with a rubberized adhesive that demonstrated 4. 6 lb/in adhesion strength to the unpainted fiberglass fairing. Adhesion strength was observed to increase {{as a function of}} time. The covers were analyzed and experimentally tested to demonstrate their ability to maintain integrity under anticipated vehicle ascent pressure loads and to not impede firing of the drogue chute mortars. Testing included vacuum testing and a mortar fire test. Tape covers were layed-up on thin Teflon sheets to facilitate installation on the vehicle. Custom cut foam insulation board was used to fill mortar hole and separation joint cavities and provide support to the applied tape covers. Flight test results showed that the tape covers remained adhered during flight...|$|R
40|$|The {{burden of}} {{translating}} the end-users’ project briefs into {{the development of}} functional support facilities that enhance {{the performance of the}} core functions of the organisation require the use of dynamic modern project management methods. In the course of developing capital assets, it is inevitable that original designs are modified, some sections redesigned while some facilities or components are out-rightly removed due to budgetary, time or other constraints. It is imperative, therefore, to incorporate the end-users into the development process, so that managing changes, trade-offs, commissioning and project <b>close-outs</b> will be smooth and enhance the achievement of customers’ satisfaction. Customers’ satisfaction, {{in the context of this}} paper, is viewed in the light of how effective and functional the completed facilities enhance the performance of the core functions of the organisation. The case study method of qualitative research was used in this research. The research data were collected through semi-structured questionnaire complemented with interviews. The thematic method was used to analyse the interview data. The client and end-users provided information on the level of their satisfaction with the performance of the capital development unit as well as identified some areas of concern that require improvement. Recommendations made include the use of Value Engineering as a project management tool; considered suitable for the management of design or scope changes and ‘trade-offs’, in order to improve on the level of customers’ satisfaction...|$|R

50|$|The more {{important}} use of netting is <b>close-out</b> netting under Section 6(e) of the ISDA Master Agreement. Pursuant to this section, when an ISDA Master Agreement (or, more accurately the outstanding Transactions under it) is terminated (normally following a credit event of some kind), {{the value of}} each of the Terminated Transactions is assessed (there are several ways this can be done, but the most usual measure is to determine how much it would cost for a party to enter into a Transaction having commercial terms identical to the Terminated Transaction with an independent third party - this is called the Settlement Amount) and converted into the Termination Currency (which should have been specified in the schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement) and any outstanding Unpaid Amounts are taken into account. The Settlement Amounts (which may be positive or negative depending which party is 'in-the-money' with respect to a particular Terminated Transaction) and unpaid amounts (again positive or negative, depending on who owes them) are added up and a single figure in the Termination Currency is determined payable by one party or the other. The enforcability of the <b>close-out</b> netting provisions is absolutely vital to financial institutions active in the derivatives market since the ability to net allows them to allocate capital only against the net figure they would have to pay on <b>close-out</b> of an ISDA Master Agreement rather than the gross amount. ISDA has obtained legal opinions from all important jurisdictions confirming the effectiveness of the <b>close-out</b> netting provisions in those jurisdictions. Members of ISDA are entitled to rely on these opinions.|$|E
