The fleet then rounded the coastline as far as Acanthus in Chalcidice, before attempting to round the headland of Mount Athos. However, they were caught in a violent storm, which drove them against the coastline of Athos, wrecking (according to Herodotus) 300 ships, {{with the loss of}} 20,000 men.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of World War I, B3, B4, and B5 were at Dover and were deployed on a line between Calais and the Goodwin Sands to protect {{the passage of the}} British Expeditionary Force to France. Each submarine would sail from Dover before dawn to be secured at the buoy marking their billet at dawn, the idea being that {{they would be able to}} slip from the buoy when they spotted an enemy ship and manoeuvre to attack. That this was not a good tactic was proved when B3 narrowly avoided a torpedo from a German U-boat on the morning of 2 October. Nonetheless the scheme was successful and the BEF <b>crossed</b> <b>to</b> France without loss.|$|E
5|$|Information {{obtained}} {{later from}} North Korean prisoners revealed the divisions the Far East Command {{thought to be}} still west of the Naktong had already <b>crossed</b> <b>to</b> the east side and {{were not in the}} bombed area. No evidence was found that the bombing killed a single North Korean soldier. However, the bombing appeared to have destroyed a significant number of North Korean artillery batteries, as artillery fire on UN positions waned substantially following the mission. The UN ground and air commanders opposed future massive carpet bombing attacks against enemy tactical troops unless there was precise information on an enemy concentration and the situation was critical. Instead, they recommended fighter-bombers and dive bombers would better support ground forces.|$|E

5|$|Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino, (23 August 1747, Craveggia – 28 June 1816, Paris), was {{a general}} and {{politician}} of France. Born in the Savoy, {{he was the son}} of a low-ranking officer in the Habsburg military. In 1789, during the French Revolution, he went to France, where he received a commission in the French Army. In 1793, his troops deposed him, for his strict discipline, but he was immediately reinstated and rose rapidly through the ranks of the general staff. He helped to push the Austrians back to Bavaria in the 1796 summer campaign, and then covered Moreau's retreat to France later that year, defending the Rhine bridge at Hüningen until the last units had <b>crossed</b> <b>to</b> safety.|$|E
5|$|The A354 road is {{the only}} land access to Portland, via Ferry Bridge, {{connecting}} to Weymouth and to the wider road network at the A35 trunk road in Dorchester. It runs from Easton, splitting into a northbound section through Chiswell and a southbound section through Fortuneswell, then along Chesil Beach and across a bridge to the mainland in Wyke Regis. Formerly a branch line railway, connecting to the South West Main Line near Weymouth railway station, also <b>crossed</b> <b>to</b> the island. The corridor is now a cycle path connecting Fortuneswell with Weymouth and a wider network of traffic-free cycle paths.|$|E
5|$|The British {{had been}} alerted to Arnold's {{approach}} and had destroyed {{all of the}} boats on the river's southern banks. Although two warships, the frigate Lizard (26 guns) and the sloop-of-war Hunter (16 guns), kept up a constant patrol to prevent a river crossing, Arnold was able to procure sufficient watercraft for his men, and <b>crossed</b> <b>to</b> the Quebec City side on November 11.

5|$|The Normans <b>crossed</b> <b>to</b> England a {{few days}} after Harold's victory over the Norwegians at Stamford Bridge on 25 September, {{following}} the dispersal of Harold's naval force. They landed at Pevensey in Sussex on 28 September and erected a wooden castle at Hastings, from which they raided the surrounding area. This ensured supplies for the army, and as Harold and his family held many of the lands in the area, it weakened William's opponent and made him more likely to attack {{to put an end to}} the raiding.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans {{withdrew from}} the Masan area the night of September 18–19.

Then the NK 6th Division had withdrawn from its positions on Sobuk-san. The US units rapidly pursued them north, passing over the Battle Mountain positions, which were no longer of strategic importance.|$|E

5|$|William mustered {{his forces}} at Saint-Valery-sur-Somme, {{and was ready}} to cross the English Channel by about 12 August. But the {{crossing}} was delayed, either because of unfavourable weather or to avoid being intercepted by the powerful English fleet. The Normans <b>crossed</b> <b>to</b> England a few days after Harold's victory over the Norwegians, following the dispersal of Harold's naval force, and landed at Pevensey in Sussex on 28 September. A few ships were blown off course and landed at Romney, where the Normans fought the local fyrd. After landing, William's forces built a wooden castle at Hastings, from which they raided the surrounding area. More fortifications were erected at Pevensey.|$|E
5|$|At around 4:00 PM on October 17, the {{pontoon bridge}} had been fully assembled, opening the first Israeli {{bridge across the}} canal. The roller bridge was laid soon after at dawn on October 18, and by afternoon, Adan's {{division}} <b>crossed</b> <b>to</b> the west bank followed by Kalman Magen's division. Adan, supported by Magen, {{would go on to}} reach Suez after the failure of a United Nations ceasefire, thereby cutting off two infantry divisions of the Egyptian Third Field Army. Sharon also crossed with part of his division, simultaneously trying to defend and expand the Israeli corridor to the Suez Canal—as well attacking northwards on the west bank to Ismailia in an attempt to similarly cut off the Second Army. His efforts bogged down, and he was unable to reach Ismailia (see Battle of Ismailia), while attempts to seize critical positions and expand the Israeli corridor on the east bank saw little to no success.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{upstream}} from Casper, the North Platte bends to the south. The original trail proceeded several {{miles along the}} river to Red Buttes, where {{a bend in the}} river formed a natural amphitheater dominated by red cliffs on the hill above. The river was easier to ford here for those who were unwilling or unable to pay to cross at one of the ferries downstream. This was the last good camp spot before leaving the river and entering the waterless stretch between the North Platte and the Sweetwater River. From here the settlers entered a difficult portion called Rock Avenue which moved from spring to spring across mostly alkaline soil and steep hills until it reached the Sweetwater River. Later settlers who had <b>crossed</b> <b>to</b> the northern side of the river at Casper would come to favor a route through a small valley called Emigrant Gap which headed directly to Rock Avenue, bypassing Red Buttes.|$|E

5|$|Cortés {{accepted}} {{an invitation from}} Aj Kan Ek', {{the king of the}} Itza, to visit Nojpetén (also known as Tayasal), and <b>crossed</b> <b>to</b> the Maya city with 20 Spanish soldiers while the rest of his army continued around the lake to meet him on the south shore. On his departure from Nojpetén, Cortés left behind a cross and a lame horse. The Spanish did not officially contact the Itza again until the arrival of Franciscan priests in 1618, when Cortés' cross was said to still be standing at Nojpetén. From the lake, Cortés continued south along the western slopes of the Maya Mountains, a particularly arduous journey that took 12 days to cover , during which he lost more than two-thirds of his horses. When he came to a river swollen with the constant torrential rains that had been falling during the expedition, Cortés turned upstream to the Gracias a Dios rapids, which took two days to cross and cost him more horses.|$|E
5|$|Five {{minutes into}} the match, D.C. United first-year player Chris Pontius had the first chance of the evening as he pushed past Sounders FC defender Leonardo González to receive a {{diagonal}} pass from Clyde Simms. However, due to the difficult shooting angle, Pontius' shot was wide of the far post. In the 10th minute, Sounders FC forward Fredy Montero had a close range shot on goal, but D.C. goalkeeper Josh Wicks parried the shot away. Seven minutes later, Christian Gomez had a goal scoring opportunity with a direct free kick from , but his low kick curled just wide of the target. In the 18th minute, Seattle midfielder Sebastian Le Toux played a ball in to teammate Freddie Ljungberg, whose shot on goal was barely saved by Wicks, who kicked out a foot to block the shot. Just before halftime, Le Toux <b>crossed</b> <b>to</b> an unmarked Montero, whose direct header on goal was just in reach of Wicks, who again made the save to keep the score level, 0–0. Seattle outshot D.C. 9–6 in the first half.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Hernan was {{the second}} of three Category 5 {{hurricane}}s during the 2002 Pacific hurricane season. The twelfth tropical cyclone, tenth named storm and sixth hurricane of the season, Hernan originated from a tropical wave that formed in the Atlantic Ocean and <b>crossed</b> <b>to</b> the Pacific Ocean. The wave spawned a low pressure system which organized into a tropical depression on August 30, a tropical storm on August 31 and a hurricane later that day. Hernan rapidly intensified and reached peak intensity as a Category5 storm on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Proceeding northwest, it maintained this strength for eighthours, but on September 2 it entered cooler waters and began to weaken. By September 6 it had degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure.|$|E

5|$|In 1139 Matilda <b>crossed</b> <b>to</b> England to {{take the}} kingdom by force, {{supported}} by her half-brother, Robert of Gloucester, and her uncle, King David I of Scotland, while Geoffrey focused on conquering Normandy. Matilda's forces captured Stephen at the Battle of Lincoln in 1141, but the Empress's attempt to be crowned at Westminster collapsed {{in the face of}} bitter opposition from the London crowds. As a result of this retreat, Matilda was never formally declared Queen of England, and was instead titled the Lady of the English. Robert was captured following the Rout of Winchester in 1141, and Matilda agreed to exchange him for Stephen. Matilda became trapped in Oxford Castle by Stephen's forces that winter, and was forced to escape across the frozen River Isis at night to avoid capture. The war degenerated into a stalemate, with Matilda controlling much of the south-west of England, and Stephen the south-east and the Midlands. Large parts {{of the rest of the}} country were in the hands of local, independent barons.|$|E
5|$|In the {{meantime}} Leo Phokas, heavily outnumbered by the Arab army, decided to rely once more on his proven ambuscade tactics, and occupied {{a position in}} the Arabs' rear, awaiting their return. Leo had been joined by the remaining forces of the adjoining provinces, including the theme of Cappadocia under its strategos, Constantine Maleinos, and occupied the narrow pass of Kylindros on the eastern Taurus Mountains. The Byzantine troops occupied the local fort, and hid themselves along the steep sides of the pass. According to the Arab chronicler Abu'l-Fida, this was the same pass that Sayf al-Dawla had <b>crossed</b> <b>to</b> begin his expedition, and many of his commanders advised against using it for the return as well; nevertheless, the Hamdanid prince, confident of his ability and judgment, had grown haughty, and refused to heed any advice, seeking to reap the glory for this expedition alone.|$|E

From 1848 to 1850 he taught at an all-girl school in Constantinople's Khasgiugh (Hasköy) quarter. In 1851 he {{traveled}} to Cilicia where {{he was sent to}} report on the state of Armenian schools. By traveling and living in various Armenian-populated provinces, he acquired an intimate knowledge of the problems and aspirations of ordinary Armenians. He was upset with the apathy the upper and middle classes of the Armenian community of Constantinople showed towards provincial Armenians.|$|E
