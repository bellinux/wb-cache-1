5|$|Thorium fuels {{also result}} in a safer and better-performing reactor core because thorium dioxide has a higher melting point, higher thermal conductivity, lower <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> and is more stable {{chemically}} than the now-common fuel uranium dioxide, which can further oxidise to triuranium octoxide (U3O8).|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} properties of gallium are highly anisotropic, i.e. have different values along {{the three major}} crystallographical axes a, b, and c (see table), producing {{a significant difference between}} the linear (α) and volume thermal expansion coefficients. The properties of gallium are strongly temperature-dependent, particularly near the melting point. For example, the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> increases by several hundred percent upon melting.|$|E
40|$|Polyimides {{widely used}} as {{high-performance}} polymers because <b>of</b> their excellent <b>thermal</b> stability and toughness. However, their <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> (CTE's) {{greater than those}} of metals, ceramics, and glasses. Decreasing CTE's of polyimides increase usefulness for aerospace and electronics applications in which dimensional stability required. Additives containing metal ions reduce <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> polyimides. Reductions range from 11 to over 100 percent...|$|R
40|$|In {{single crystal}} form, SiC and Al 2 O 3 are {{attractive}} reinforcing components for high temperature composites. In this study, the axial <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> and single crystal elastic constants of SiC and Al 2 O 3 {{were used to}} determine their <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> and Young's moduli as a function of crystallographic orientation and temperature. SiC and Al 2 O 3 exhibit a strong variation of Young's modulus with orientation; however, their moduli and anisotropies are weak functions of temperature below 1000 C. The <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> exhibit significant temperature dependence, and that of the non-cubic Al 2 O 3 is also a function of crystallographic orientation...|$|R

At each prestressing level, the <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> under different temperature levels were tested. The <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> strain versus low temperature or prestressing level relationships were reported. Based on these test data, regression analysis were carried out to develop the mathematical models to predict the linear expansion strain at different low temperature and prestressing stress. Finally, the empirical design formulae on the <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> were recommended for the steel strands under different loading levels and low temperatures ranging from 20 to −  180  °C.|$|R
5|$|Of all {{metals in}} pure form, {{tungsten}} {{has the highest}} melting point (3422°C, 6192°F), lowest vapor pressure (at temperatures above 1650°C, 3000°F), and the highest tensile strength. Although carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than tungsten, carbon sublimes at atmospheric pressure instead of melting, so it has no melting point. Tungsten has the lowest <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> of any pure metal. The low thermal expansion and high melting point and tensile strength of tungsten originate from strong covalent bonds formed between tungsten atoms by the 5d electrons.|$|E
5|$|Lithium's <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> {{is twice}} that of {{aluminium}} and almost four times that of iron. Lithium is superconductive below 400 μK at standard pressure and at higher temperatures (more than 9 K) at very high pressures (>20 GPa). At temperatures below 70 K, lithium, like sodium, undergoes diffusionless phase change transformations. At 4.2 K it has a rhombohedral crystal system (with a nine-layer repeat spacing); at higher temperatures it transforms to face-centered cubic and then body-centered cubic. At liquid-helium temperatures (4 K) the rhombohedral structure is prevalent. Multiple allotropic forms have been identified for lithium at high pressures.|$|E
5|$|Diamond is hard, {{chemically}} inert, and {{has high}} thermal conductivity {{and a low}} <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion.</b> These properties make diamond superior to any other existing window material used for transmitting infrared and microwave radiation. Therefore, synthetic diamond is starting to replace zinc selenide as the output window of high-power CO2 lasers and gyrotrons. Those synthetic polycrystalline diamond windows are shaped as disks of large diameters (about 10cm for gyrotrons) and small thicknesses (to reduce absorption) and can only be produced with the CVD technique. Single crystal slabs of dimensions of length up to approximately 10mm are becoming increasingly important in several areas of optics including heatspreaders inside laser cavities, diffractive optics and as the optical gain medium in Raman lasers. Recent advances in the HPHT and CVD synthesis techniques have improved the purity and crystallographic structure perfection of single-crystalline diamond enough to replace silicon as a diffraction grating and window material in high-power radiation sources, such as synchrotrons. Both the CVD and HPHT processes are also used to create designer optically transparent diamond anvils {{as a tool for}} measuring electric and magnetic properties of materials at ultra high pressures using a diamond anvil cell.|$|E

25|$|Very low {{temperature}} melting glasses, fluid at 200–400°C, were developed for sealing applications for electronics. They can consist of binary or ternary mixtures of thallium, arsenic and sulfur. Zinc-silicoborate glasses {{can also be used}} for passivation of electronics; their <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> must match silicon (or the other semiconductors used) and they must not contain alkaline metals as those would migrate to the semiconductor and cause failures.|$|E

"Compression seals" [...] {{occur when}} the glass and the metal have {{different}} <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> such that the metal compresses around the solidified glass as it cools.

40|$|Damage in {{the form}} of {{transverse}} cracks resulting from thermal loading is studied {{as it relates to the}} dimensional stability of flat laminates and stiffness changes in cylindrical tubes. Graphite-epoxy specimens were subjected to cyclic thermal loading in the temperature range - 250 to + 250 F. It is shown that transverse cracking is the dominant damage mechanism in both types of structural elements. Fiber splitting is also quite common at the low test temperatures. Experimental results indicate that damage significantly reduces the inplane <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> flat laminates and the torsional stiffness of the tubes. Theoretical predictions for <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> as a function of crack spacing in flat laminates followed the same trend as experimental results...|$|R

25|$|The {{finite element}} method (FEM) is a {{powerful}} technique originally developed for numerical solution of complex problems in structural mechanics, and it remains the method of choice for complex systems. In the FEM, the structural system is modeled {{by a set of}} appropriate finite elements interconnected at discrete points called nodes. Elements may have physical properties such as thickness, <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion,</b> density, Young's modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's ratio.|$|E
25|$|Parts-per notations may be {{expressed}} in terms of any unit of the same measure. For instance, the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> of a certain brass alloy, α=18.7ppm/°C, may {{be expressed}} as 18.7(µm/m)/°C, or as 18.7(µin/in)/°C; the numeric value representing a relative proportion does not change with the adoption of a different unit of measure. Similarly, a metering pump that injects a trace chemical into the main process line at the proportional flow rate Qp=125ppm, is doing so at a rate that may {{be expressed in}} a variety of volumetric units, including 125µL/L, 125µgal/gal, 125cm3/m3, etc.|$|E
25|$|Metals {{and other}} solid {{materials}} expand upon heating and contract upon cooling. This is an undesirable occurrence in electrical systems. Copper {{has a low}} <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> for an electrical conducting material. Aluminium, an alternate common conductor, expands nearly one third more than copper under increasing temperatures. This higher degree of expansion, along with aluminium’s lower ductility, can cause electrical problems when bolted connections are improperly installed. By using proper hardware, such as spring pressure connections and cupped or split washers at the joint, {{it may be possible}} to create aluminium joints that compare in quality to copper joints.|$|E

25|$|Using the Debye model, the {{specific}} heat and entropy of a pure crystal are proportional to T3, while the enthalpy and chemical potential are proportional to T4. (Guggenheim, p.111) These quantities drop toward their T=0 limiting values and approach with zero slopes. For {{the specific}} heats at least, the limiting value itself is definitely zero, as {{borne out by}} experiments to below 10K. Even the less detailed Einstein model shows this curious drop in specific heats. In fact, all specific heats vanish at absolute zero, not just those of crystals. Likewise for the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion.</b> Maxwell's relations show that various other quantities also vanish. These phenomena were unanticipated.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the removal of internal reciprocating stresses by the complete removal of reciprocating internal parts typically found in a piston engine, the Wankel engine is constructed with an iron rotor within a housing made of aluminium, which has a greater <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion.</b> This ensures that even a severely overheated Wankel engine cannot seize, as is {{likely to occur in}} an overheated piston engine. This is a substantial safety benefit when used in aircraft. In addition, the absence of valves and valve trains increases safety. GM tested an iron rotor and iron housing in their prototype Wankel engines, that worked at higher temperatures with lower specific fuel consumption.|$|E
25|$|A {{bimetallic}} strip {{is used to}} convert a temperature change into mechanical displacement. The strip consists of two strips of different metals which expand at different rates as they are heated, usually steel and copper, {{or in some cases}} steel and brass. The strips are joined together throughout their length by riveting, brazing or welding. The different expansions force the flat strip to bend one way if heated, and in the opposite direction if cooled below its initial temperature. The metal with the higher <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> is on the outer side of the curve when the strip is heated and on the inner side when cooled.|$|E

50|$|Over time, many {{of these}} {{terminations}} with solid aluminum wire began to fail due to improper connection techniques and the dissimilar metals having different resistances and significantly different <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion,</b> as well as problems with properties of the solid wires.

25|$|Sodium {{borosilicate}} glass, Pyrex: silica + boron trioxide (B2O3) + soda (Na2O) + alumina (Al2O3). Stands {{heat expansion}} {{much better than}} window glass. Used for chemical glassware, cooking glass, car head lamps, etc. Borosilicate glasses (e.g. Pyrex, Duran) have as main constituents silica and boron trioxide. They have fairly low coefficients of thermal expansion (7740 Pyrex CTE is 3.25/°C as compared to about 9/°C for a typical soda-lime glass), making them more dimensionally stable. The lower <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> (CTE) also makes them less subject to stress caused by thermal expansion, thus less vulnerable to cracking from thermal shock. They are commonly used for reagent bottles, optical components and household cookware.|$|E
25|$|EBPVD {{systems are}} {{equipped}} with ion sources. These ion sources are used for substrate etching and cleaning, sputtering the target and controlling the microstructure of the substrate. The ion beams bombard the surface and alter the microstructure of the film. When the deposition reaction takes place on the hot substrate surface, the films can develop an internal tensile stress due to the mismatch in the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> between the substrate and the film. High-energy ions {{can be used to}} bombard these ceramic thermal barrier coatings and change the tensile stress into compressive stress. Ion bombardment also increases the density of the film, changes the grain size and modifies amorphous films to polycrystalline films. Low-energy ions are used for the surfaces of semiconductor films.|$|E

Parts of this car, {{such as the}} fascia {{and body}} panels, were manufactured using a new process called reaction injection molding (RIM), in which the reactants were mixed and then injected into a mold. The addition of fillers, such as milled glass, mica, and processed mineral fibres, gave rise to reinforced RIM (RRIM), which provided improvements in flexural modulus (stiffness), reduction in <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>expansion</b> and better thermal stability.This technology was {{used to make the}} first plastic-body automobile in the United States, the Pontiac Fiero, in 1983.
