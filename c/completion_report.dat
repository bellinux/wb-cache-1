30|$|Porosities of the Bunter {{sandstone}} formation are generally lower than {{derived from the}} mechanical compaction curve published by Gluyas and Cade (1997), indicating that most sandstones of the Bunter Sandstone formation contain clays and diagenetic cements (Fig.  4). The Bunter {{sandstone formation}} retains relatively high porosity at greater depths, as detrital clays contain microporosity and diagenetic iron-oxide/hydroxide coatings seem to retard quartz cementation (Table  1; Olivarius et al. 2015 a). The Tønder area in the southernmost part of Denmark (Fig.  1) is a potential site for geothermal exploitation and here the Bunter Sandstone reservoir (situated {{at a depth of}} 1500 – 2000  m) is characterized by average porosities (c. 22  %) that are higher than indicated by the general trend line. The porosity development at Tønder is mainly due to a dominance of aeolian deposition that favoured generation of very well-sorted and clay-free sandstones, but also the presence of nitrogen gas contributes to porosity preservation during burial cf. the Tønder- 3 and - 4 well <b>completion</b> <b>reports</b> (Mærsk 1981; Dong 1983). The Kegnæs- 1 and Kværs- 1 wells, also located {{in the southern part of}} Denmark, have encountered the Bunter Sandstone formation at a similar depth (1500 – 2000  m), but here the porosities (c. 17  %) are somewhat lower than indicated by the general trend for the Bunter Sandstone formation. Cutting descriptions reported in the well <b>completion</b> <b>reports</b> (Mærsk 1985; Texaco 1985) indicate that this porosity difference most likely is attributed to the presence of more fine-grained sandstones with higher clay content at Kegnæs and Kværs.|$|R

The report describes results of research projects sponsored by the center, its information transfer and coordination activities, and its involvement in training water resources scientists and engineers. During this period, the Center funded eight projects through its federal grant program. A {{wide range of issues}} and problems were addressed by the eight projects. Four were concerned with water quality aspects of Minnesota lakes, one each with lake-groundwater hydrology, wetlands, water quality, and treatment technology. Two lake projects developed new and improved methods to assess nutritional and trophic status of lakes, and a third project was concerned with assessing trophic state changes in prairie lakes of central Minnesota since agricultural activity began in the region during the mid 19 th century. Another project examined historical trends of mercury contamination in lakes of northeastern Minnesota in relation to efforts to define the sources of contamination. Four of the FY 1987 projects were in their second (and final) year, and <b>completion</b> <b>reports</b> are in preparation for publication in late 1988. <b>Completion</b> <b>reports</b> for two projects that ended in FY 86 were published during the past year.

5000|$|Mary Sudik No. 1 {{well was}} {{developed}} by the Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Company on the property of Vincent and Mary Sudik. [...] The well, located about 2000 ft to the southeast of the present intersection of Interstate 240 and Bryant Avenue, to the south of the Oklahoma City center, blew out when the drilling crew underestimated well pressures in the newly developed Wilcox formation, producing 20,000 barrels of oil and [...] of gas per day from the 6471 ft well. According to the well <b>completion</b> <b>report,</b> it produced 15,441 barrels of oil in a test run for 13 hours and 15 minutes. [...] The crew had neglected to keep sufficient drilling mud in the well, and did not use a safety head, contrary to the accepted practice of the time, running the well [...] "wild." [...] The initial flow of gas from the well changed to oil after about a day, with oil fountaining up to 400 ft into the air. Oil vapor blew in the wind as far as Norman, 11 mi to the south. A safety zone was established around the well to prevent fire. The American Iron and Machine Company was engaged to cap the well, led by superintendent H. M. Myracle. [...] The first attempt failed after twelve hours, but a second attempt restricted the flow, and oil was diverted into a pit until a final seal could be effected. A total of 211,600 barrels of oil was recovered from the vicinity of the well, and as many as 800,000 barrels were believed to have been wasted. Once controlled, Mary Sudik No. 1 was the most productive well in the world in 1930.|$|E
50|$|Private sector {{participation}} {{in the provision of}} water supply and sanitation in Turkey is mostly limited to the operation of water and wastewater treatment plants without direct contact with customers. An exception is the lease contract in Antalya from 1996 to 2002, where a private company directly provided water and sewer services to customers. In 1996 the city signed a lease contract with a private company to provide water and sanitation services for 10 years. The decision to opt for a lease was taken on the advice of a UK consulting firm without an options study that would have compared different alternatives of private sector participation. The contract was awarded after international competitive bidding with three bids submitted. It was awarded to the lowest qualified bidder called ANTSU, a consortium between the French water company Lyonnaise des Eaux (today Suez Environnement) and the Turiksh firm ENKA (the latter left the consortium shortly after the contract was signed). Ownership of assets remained with the public company, Antalya Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (ASAT). ANTSU received an agreed remuneration per cubic meter of water collected from ASAT customers. Investments were partially financed through loans from the World Bank and the European Investment Bank. There were some slight improvements during the contract period, such as an increase of the continuity of water supply from 19 to 23 hours per day. However, an important indicator, non-revenue water, stagnated at a high level of about 60%, while the private operator had aimed at reducing it to 30% within three years. Half way through the contract period the private operator said it lost money and asked to increase its remuneration. When the municipality refused, ANTSU said it was obliged under Turkish law to liquidate itself. ASAT then assumed responsibility for operations in 2002 and the contract ended amidst compensation claims by both sides. In its <b>completion</b> <b>report</b> for the project that supported the lease, the World Bank concluded that the outcomes were unsatisfactory. However, there were also successes: For example, funds provided through the World Bank loan contributed to increase the share of sewerage connections from zero in 1996 to 35% of the urbanized area in 2003.|$|E
