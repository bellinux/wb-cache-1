There {{a large body of}} knowledge on Indigenous housing in Australia that promotes the provision and design of housing that supports Indigenous residents’ socio-spatial needs, domilicary behaviours, cultural values and aspirations. The culturally specific needs for Indigenous housing have been identified as major factors in the success of housing and failing to recognise the varying and diverse cultural housing needs of Indigenous peoples have been cited as the reasons for Aboriginal housing failures by academics for a number of decades. Western style housing imposes conditions on Indigenous residents that may hinder the practice of cultural norms. If adjusting to living in a particular house strains relationships, then severe stress on the occupants may result. Ross noted, [...] "Inappropriate housing and town planning have the capacity to disrupt social organisation, the mechanisms for maintaining smooth social relations, and support networks." [...] There are a range of cultural factors which are discussed in the literature. These include designing housing to accommodate aspects of <b>customary</b> <b>behaviour</b> such as avoidance behaviours, household group structures, sleeping and eating behaviours, cultural constructs of crowding and privacy, and responses to death. All of the literature indicates that each housing design should be approached independently to recognise the many Indigenous cultures with varying customs and practices that exist across Australia.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Research within Indigenous {{communities}} {{has been}} criticised for lacking community engagement, for being exploitative, and for poorly explaining {{the processes of}} research. To address these concerns, and to ensure ‘best practice’, Jamieson, et al. (2012) recently published a summary of principles outlined by the NHMRC (2003) in “one short, accessible document”. Here we expand on Jamieson et al. ’s paper, which while commendable, lacks emphasis on the contribution that communities themselves can make to the research process and how culturally appropriate engagement, can allow this contribution to be assured, specifically with respect to engagement with remote communities. Engagement started before the research proposal is put forward, and continued after the research is completed, has integrity. We emphasise the value of narratives, of understanding cultural and <b>customary</b> <b>behaviours</b> and leadership, the importance of cultural legitimacy, and {{of the need for}} time, not just to allow for delays, but to ensure genuine participatory engagement from all members of the community. We also challenge researchers to consider the outcomes of their research, on the basis that increasing clinical evidence does not always result in better outcomes for the communit...|$|R
40|$|Therapists find it {{challenging}} to integrate research evidence into their clinical decision-making {{because it may}} involve modifying their existing practices. Although continuing education (CE) programmes for evidence-based practice (EBP) have employed various approaches to increase individual practitioner’s knowledge and skills, these {{have been shown to}} have little impact in changing <b>customary</b> <b>behaviours.</b> To date, there has been little attempt to actively engage therapists as collaborators in developing educational processes concerning EBP. The researcher collaborated with seven clinical therapists (one occupational therapist, four physiotherapists and two speech and language therapists) enrolled in a new post-qualification Implementing Evidence in Therapy Practice (IETP) MSc module to monitor and adapt the learning programme over ten weeks. The participating therapists actively engaged in participatory action research (PAR) iterative cycles of reflecting→ planning→ acting→ observing→ reflecting with the researcher. Mixed methods were used to evaluate the IETP module and its influence on therapists’ subsequent engagement in EBP activities. Data were gathered immediately on completion of the module and five months later. Immediate post-module findings revealed four components as being important to the therapists: 1) characteristics of the learning environment; 2) acquisition of relevant EBP skills; 3) nature of the learning process; and 4) acquiring confidence. The two themes and sub-themes which emerged from individual interviews conducted five months post-module expanded on the four components already identified. Theme 1 : Experiencing the learning (sub-themes: module organisation; learning is relational; improving the module); and theme 2 : Enacting the learning through a new way of being (sub-themes: criticality and reflection; self agency; modelling EBP behaviours; positioning self in an EB work culture). The therapists’ perspectives had by then shifted from that of a learner to that of a clinician constructing a new sense of self as an evidence-based practitioner. Findings from this study underline the importance of the process of socially constructed knowledge and of empowering learners through collaboratively designed continuing education programmes. In the student-driven learning environment, therapists chose repetitive skill-building and authentic problem-solving activities which reflected the complexity of the environments to which they were expected to transfer their learning. These findings have implications for educators designing EBP continuing education programmes, during which students develop professional ways of being...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores two inter-related themes. One {{addresses}} {{fundamental questions}} of human nature, arguing that conventional theories of behaviour lack a credible {{appreciation of the}} interaction between cognition and context (or what is often termed as the 'environment'). The second considers decision-making under risk and uncertainty, focusing upon <b>customary</b> <b>behaviour</b> and the significance or otherwise of conscious deliberation. My argument is intended to be both critical and constructive, exploring the claims of the emerging school of behaviouralism associated with Kahneman and Tversky now sweeping the social sciences. Most importantly, it is argued that economic geography should take more seriously the nature and scope of behaviour recognising its attributes including related social and cultural aspirations. These ideas are illustrated by a set of recent studies dealing with financial decision-making and individuals' attitudes towards risk in personal and occupational pension plans. The importance of this project lies in the urgent need to understand the diversity of behaviour of men and women in, and through, the communities in which they live without being reduced to yet another version of environmental determinism. In conclusion, implications are drawn for understanding the global financial crisis...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} a Hindu-Balinese {{organization and}} its activities in Jakarta. In this predominantly Muslim city, Hindu-Balinese residents have formed {{an organization called}} banjar to obtain various facilities for their activities. It originates from the Balinese banjar organization, which is the customary fundamental residential unit, though in Jakarta it loses its obligatory character and can be classified as a voluntary association. Based on their banjar activity, Balinese in Jakarta construct their temples (pura), invite priests (pedanda) from Bali and support them. The temples are the base for Balinese activities such as cremation, periodical praying at full moon and dark moon, Hindu religious lessons for youth, and cultural activities such as traditional dancing and gamelan orchestra. One of the interesting points of Hindu-Balilnese activities in Jakarta is that participants adopt a more dogmatic and innovational style in the religious sphere than people in Bali. While they attach less importance to <b>customary</b> <b>behaviour</b> (adat) such as ritual clothes, they practice full-moon and dark-moon prayer, which has never been practiced traditionally in Bali and has only recently been introduced by the Hindu Council (Parisada Hindu Dharma Indonesia). Hindu-Balinese activities in Jakarta show {{an example of a}} new phase of Indonesian religious activity which contrasts sharply with the customary conservative local activity...|$|E

40|$|Background Gypsies and Travellers {{are known}} to have poor health status and access to health services, even in {{comparison}} to other ethnic minority groups. People from this stigmatised ethnic group are rarely consulted about their health needs or health service provision. Optimal infant feeding {{in the first year of}} life has the potential to improve life long health. Objective The aim of this study is to explore mothers and grandmothers’ views on feeding in the first year of life, including the support provided by health professionals. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposively selected sample of 22 mothers and grandmothers of English Gypsy, Irish Traveller and Romanian Roma ethnicity between November 2011 and February 2012 in a city in South-West England. Results Few women perceived themselves as requiring help from health professionals in infant feeding, as acceptable and accessible support was available from within their own communities. Roma mothers described a tradition of breastfeeding and appropriately timed weaning, while English Gypsies and Irish Travellers customarily practised less healthy infant feeding. When mothers requested support, health service provision was often found inadequate. Conclusion Exploring the views of Gypsies and Travellers is important to gain insight into the provision of health services for this marginalised ethnic group. This study has implications for policy and the practice of health professionals, in indicating the <b>customary</b> feeding <b>behaviours</b> of some Gypsy and Travellers, and highlighting areas meriting culturally sensitive health promotion...|$|R
40|$|Background: Deviant off-field {{behaviour}} is now {{generally accepted}} as {{being part of}} a ‘normal’ sporting culture. The majority of research into such behaviour has focussed primarily on the immediate impact of alcohol consumption on sporting performance, with such research highlighting the ergolytic nature of alcohol on performance. The fundamental issue with such research however is that the deviant behaviour associated with sports such as rugby union typically occurs the night previous to or following competition, accordingly the effect of such <b>customary</b> <b>behaviour</b> on recovery from competition or on subsequent performance would be more specific to what actually occurs. Initial work has found that moderate alcohol consumption adversely affects the recovery of exercise induced microstructural damage post eccentric exercise, as well a negatively affecting subsequent lower body power output post rugby simulation. Despite conclusions suggesting that alcohol negatively influences both recovery and subsequent performance, such conclusions may not be truly representative of what typically occurs due to the behaviour investigated being far different to what occurs naturally. The question of how customary off-field rugby behaviour affects both recovery and subsequent performance therfore remains unanswered. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether post-game behaviour, that is customary to rugby union, is detrimental to the subsequent performance of players in the days following competitive match play. Methods: Using a naturalistic means of investigation, thirty senior grade club rugby players were allocated to either the standardized post game behaviour (SPGB) or investigated post game behaviour (IPGB) conditions following a competitive rugby match. Players involved in the IPGB condition were left to undergo customary post rugby game behaviour whilst those in the SPGB had their behaviour controlled according to recommended guidelines. Performance measures, behaviour recall and indicators of both muscle damage and hydration status were tested at both twelve and thirty six hours following match play Rugby’s customary post-game behaviour does not affect subsequent performance Results: Following competitive match play participants in the IPGB condition reported significant (p< 0. 01) alcohol consumption with a corresponding decrease in sleep when compared with the SPGB. Irrespective of such behaviour, performance measures were not significantly affected. Finally no significant difference was seen between conditions in either hydration status or CK. Conclusions: The results of the present naturalistic study indicate that following a competitive match, customary rugby behaviour consisting of significant alcohol consumption and a reduction in sleep failed to significantly affect subsequent rugby specific performance measures in the days following the match...|$|E
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the University of Wolverhampton for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyArchitecture has been pushed towards the realms of theorization, conceptualization and design methodologies. It is apparent that design is becoming interrupted and more associated with the manufacturing of ideas. It has lost its essence as a phenomenon whose roots are embedded in history and man’s relationship with his specific habitat. Hence, the aim of the thesis is to redirect architectural attention to Ecology and its various implications on design. The study puts forward the notion that human achievements are an outcome of the interaction between ecology, Culture and Cognitive Structure. These relationships are thought to set the principles behind environmental qualities of stability, compatibility and fitness. Once designers arrive at an understanding of these principles, {{they will be able to}} manipulate their design ideas to accommodate ever changing circumstances of their physical and cultural environments. The title “Physical, cultural and cognitive interactions in the conception and the production of the built environment” implies a significant theme which could indicate major traits that characterize modern practices and theorisation within the area of Architectural and Environmental Design Studies. In this work, it will be seen why and how: First, a lack of consideration for the physical environment, its requirements and its role in producing diversified architectural forms. The most significant outcome of a such position lies in divorcing nature, its laws and the ecosystems on which man has spent the preceding history elaborating building patterns on the basis of utilising them for his interest free of charge and without consequences to his survival. The fact is that different cultures, ways of life and differentiated built environments, which can only be attributed to man’s adaptation to different ecological conditions, have been widely swept away under the mythical notion of “International style”. Second, because the architects and theorists of the contemporary architecture admire mental constructions and abstract philosophies of their own, they have advocated an alien and distorted meaning of the concept of culture. The most likely interpretation of this vital concept is that it is viewed as related to a kind of abstract intellectual capacity in the human brain that does not lend itself to variation in the physical setting. Tragically, the adoption of such view has resulted in sweeping away subcultures which have been developed in remote areas in accordance with their geographical setting. The most acceptable meaning of culture has been to imply the role of physical environment in shaping social relations, the modes of thought, norms, beliefs, ways of life, the ideologies and the total range of <b>customary</b> <b>behaviour,</b> all of which have been influenced by people’s adaptation to their environment. Therefore, building forms, patterns of growth, town morphology, in short, architectural phenomenon, has, like culture, evolved characteristics from its natural habitat. We now often observe that such an argument is totally diminishing in the present architecture and in the environmental activities of those in charge. Third, the interruption of continuity and flow of human cognitive knowledge by introducing techniques and thoughts whose practical values, aesthetical capacities and meanings do not correspond with people’s knowledge of the environment, building behaviour or activities associated with the history of people’s relation to their own habitat. This work is structured in two main parts; the first one will deal with the contribution of the different disciplines such as Ecology, Culture, Economy, Psychology, Architecture and Urban Design from the theoretical point of view in the development of the different concepts. In the second part, we will discuss the impact of these disciplines on the production of our built environment and we will end up by suggesting a model highlighting the interactions of these disciplines in the evaluation and the production of our built environment through a chosen case study which is Algiers.

40|$|The {{lives of}} medieval English peasants were {{influenced}} {{more by the}} manor than any other secular institution. Through its court they resolved disputes, received customary holdings, engaged in the land market and were subject to manorial discipline. Where the lord exercised view of frankpledge, his court licensed them to produce and sell bread and ale, and they presented petty criminals and offenders against by-laws or custom. Better-off peasants, serving as jurors and manorial office-holders, were able to influence the procedures and business of the court. This thesis identifies {{the extent to which}} peasant society remained subject to manorial courts, during the 150 years after the Black Death, in certain Northamptonshire manors, grouped in three different regions of the county and governed by different forms of lordship: royal, gentry and conventual. In the royal manors remote lordship effectively devolved management to members of the local peasant elite: for example, the land market was administered through elected bailiffs. There is no evidence of late survival of the incidents of serfdom, although entry fines on admission to land were relatively high. At Brigstock, notably, the court continued to be used as an effective forum for inter-peasant litigation {{to the end of the}} fifteenth century. On the gentry and priory manors, although 4 ttempts to prevent the emigration of the unfree were unavailing, customary tenants remained subject to burdens such as labour services, heriot and the maintenance of redundant buildings. On such manors tenants had largely abandoned the court as a forum for litigation by 1450. Irrespective of lordship, peasants continued to owe suit, undertake office and assent to by-laws regulating agriculture and social <b>behaviour.</b> <b>Customary</b> tenure remained subject to the court. Particularly where view of frankpledge was exercised through the manor court, its range of business and impact on local people was largely undiminished by 1500.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} trial of Japanese war crimes conducted by Australia between 1945 and 1951; although the study commences in 1943, when the Government first focussed on the issue, and ends in 1961, when the issue was closed. Beyond providing {{an overview of the}} trials the thesis addresses the major criticism of the trials by looking at whether the trails were fair and if they fulfilled Australian aims. This is addressed {{within the context of the}} two elements of international law, the political, and the legal, and examined in each of the three sections. The Policy section establishes the political context of the trials by examining the influence of the international community and the Australian Government. Both influenced structure and progress rather than the final application of the law. When Australian attitudes were incongruous with international views, a perception that Australia was harsh and repressive developed even though justice was an important part of the Government’s agenda. A study of legal aspects of the trials commences in the Procedures section. Australia’s legislation and regulations are explained with particular emphasis on the more controversial aspects, and a comparison is made with the war crimes instruments of other Allies trying the Japanese showing many similarities between the regulations used by other nations and Australia’s. Procedures also discusses the framework for the Australian trials, the procedures used to bring a case to trial, the process used in court, the review process and the carrying out of sentences. Such a thorough study of the procedural basis is necessary to evaluate the individual trials. Practical examples of some of the procedural problems are also discussed in the following section – Practice. This section reviews a number of trials and the various types of crimes and the claims made in defence to show how Australia applied and interpreted the law. The study finds many similarities between Australia’s application of the law and the practice of other nations, indicating that Australian courts were applying what was considered to be <b>customary</b> expectations of <b>behaviour.</b> Throughout the trials there was little evidence of vindictiveness or revenge, either by Government or in the courts. Both were faced with significant problems, which were not always dealt with well but overall the trials were fair and those involved were concerned that justice should not only be seen to be done, but actually be done...|$|R
