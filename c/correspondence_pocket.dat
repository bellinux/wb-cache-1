5000|$|Caravan Books Publishing House was {{established}} in 1997. Since then, Caravan has published many titles in fiction and nonfiction including criticism, mythology, psychology, screenplays, poetry, <b>correspondence,</b> <b>pocket</b> books, commemoration, references, etc. In the year 2000, Caravan invited Paulo Coelho, the famous Brazilian author, to Iran. It is alleged {{that he was the}} first non-Muslim author to visit Iran after the Islamic Revolution.At the year 1991, Caravan presented the Paulo Coelho Literary Award and the next year, in collaboration with Andishesazan Publishing House, established the Yaldaa Literary Award, dedicated to fiction and literary criticism, which has now been presented for four years. In 2001, Caravan published Kaamyaab Cultural Monthly, which after five issues was renamed Book Fiesta Monthly. Twenty two issues of Book Fiesta have been published since then.|$|E

Being able to predict if a small molecule could bind {{to one or more}} protein targets or if a protein could bind to some given ligands is very useful for drug discovery endeavors, anticipation of binding to off- and anti-targets. To date, several studies explore such questions from chemogenomic approach to reverse docking methods. Most of these studies have been performed either from the viewpoint of ligands or targets. However it seems valuable to use information from both ligands and target binding pockets. Hence, we present a multivariate approach relating ligand properties with protein pocket properties from the analysis of known ligand-protein interactions. We explored and optimized the pocket-ligand pair space by combining pocket and ligand descriptors using Principal Component Analysis and developed a classification engine on this paired space, revealing five main clusters of pocket-ligand pairs sharing specific and similar structural or physico-chemical properties. These pocket-ligand pair clusters highlight <b>correspondences</b> between <b>pocket</b> and ligand topological and physico-chemical properties and capture relevant information with respect to protein-ligand interactions. Based on these pocket-ligand correspondences, a protocol of prediction of clusters sharing similarity in terms of recognition characteristics is developed for a given pocket-ligand complex and gives high performances. It is then extended to cluster prediction for a given pocket in order to acquire knowledge about it...|$|R

He was obliged at first to board a street car. Afterwards he found a taxicab, and drove under the great wooden shed as the last siren was blowing. He hurried up the gangway, a grim, remorseful figure, a sense of defeat gnawing at his heart, a bitter, haunting fear still with him even when, with a shriek of the tugs, the great steamer swung into the river. He was leaving forever the work to which he had given so much of his life, leaving it a fugitive and dishonoured. The blaze of lights, the screaming of the great ferry-boats, all the triumphant, brazen noises of the mighty city, sounded like a requiem to him as in the darkest part of the promenade deck he leaned over the railing and nursed his agony, the supreme agony of an ambitious man--failure.|$|R
