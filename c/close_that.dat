5|$|Holy Trinity Church on Boar Lane was {{constructed}} between 1721 and 1727, built to a design by William Etty. It is a Grade I listed building. The building {{has not changed}} much (although a new steeple was built in 1839 by R D Chantrell), but developments such as the Burton Arcade and the Leeds Shopping Plaza have been built so <b>close</b> <b>that</b> {{it is difficult to}} see the full exterior of the building as was once possible.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{an attempt}} to force Stroud to {{discontinue}} his business {{and get rid of}} his birds failed after Stroud and one of his mail correspondents, a bird researcher from Indiana named Della Mae Jones, made his story known to newspapers and magazines. A massive letter campaign and a 50,000-signature petition sent to President Herbert Hoover resulted in Stroud being permitted to keep his birds, and despite prison overcrowding, he was even given a second cell to house them. However, his letter-writing privileges were greatly curtailed. Jones and Stroud grew so <b>close</b> <b>that</b> she moved to Kansas in 1931, and started a business with him, selling his avian medicines.|$|E

5|$|The bee-eaters are diurnal (active by day), {{although}} a few species may migrate during the night if the terrain en route is unsuitable for stopping or if they are crossing the sea. Bee-eaters are highly social, and pairs sitting or roosting together are often so <b>close</b> <b>that</b> they touch (an individual distance of zero). Many species are colonial in the breeding season and some species are also highly gregarious when not nesting.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} so <b>close</b> <b>that</b> one early vote count had the {{candidates}} tied at 77,225 votes each. Absentee ballots decided the election; ballots were accepted until April 13. While Tedisco had been ahead in early counts, by April 10 Murphy was leading, and by April 23 Murphy had a 401-vote advantage. Tedisco conceded the race the following day, and Murphy {{was sworn in}} on April 29. Democratic electoral successes in November 2008 and Murphy's clear support of the stimulus package were credited for his success.|$|E
5|$|An apex {{predator}} affects {{prey population}} dynamics and defense tactics (such as camouflage). The polar bear is the apex predator within its range. Several animal species, particularly Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus), routinely scavenge polar bear kills. The relationship between ringed seals and polar bears is so <b>close</b> <b>that</b> {{the abundance of}} ringed seals in some areas appears to regulate the density of polar bears, while polar bear predation in turn regulates density and reproductive success of ringed seals. The evolutionary pressure of polar bear predation on seals probably accounts for some significant differences between Arctic and Antarctic seals. Compared to the Antarctic, {{where there is no}} major surface predator, Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out on the ice, and rarely defecate on the ice. The fur of Arctic pups is white, presumably to provide camouflage from predators, whereas Antarctic pups all have dark fur.|$|E

5|$|At 02:45, Amethyst {{was able}} to pull across the bows of Niémen, inflicting a devastating raking fire on the French ship which caused terrible damage. Niémen surged forward into Amethyst, but the {{collision}} caused little damage and at 03:00 Amethyst again raked her opponent, this time from the east. The frigates were so <b>close</b> <b>that</b> shot from Amethyst started fires among Niémens hammock netting, placed along the decks to deter boarding actions. At 03:15, Niémens mizenmast and main topmast collapsed and another fire {{broke out in the}} main top, but Amethyst was also severely damaged and at 03:30 her mainmast fell onto the deck from a combination of shot damage and stress in high winds. Niémens mainmast also collapsed a few minutes later. Both frigates had stopped firing at 03:25, as the confusion on their decks was brought under control.|$|E
5|$|Beagles were {{developed}} primarily for hunting hare, an activity known as beagling. They {{were seen as}} ideal hunting companions for the elderly who could follow on horseback without exerting themselves, for young hunters who could keep up with them on ponies, and for the poorer hunters who {{could not afford to}} maintain a stable of good hunting horses. Before the advent of the fashion for foxhunting in the 19th century, hunting was an all day event where the enjoyment was derived from the chase rather than the kill. In this setting the tiny beagle was well matched to the hare, as unlike Harriers they would not quickly finish the hunt, but because of their excellent scent-tracking skills and stamina they were almost guaranteed to eventually catch the hare. The beagle packs would run closely together ("so <b>close</b> <b>that</b> they might be covered with a sheet") which was useful in a long hunt, as it prevented stray dogs from obscuring the trail. In thick undergrowth they were also preferred to spaniels when hunting pheasant.|$|E

Hill left Williams as the team's second most successful driver in terms of race victories, with 21, second only to Mansell. Hill's 1996 world championship earned him his second BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award, making him one of only three people to receive the award twice – the others being boxer Henry Cooper and Mansell. Hill was also awarded the Segrave Trophy by the Royal Automobile Club. The trophy is awarded to the British national who accomplishes the most outstanding demonstration of the possibilities of transport by land, sea, air, or water.|$|E

5|$|Fernando Cisneros Carrillo {{was born}} on August 25, 1932, son of Edgardo Cisneros Díaz Isabel Carrillo Iñiguez in the Lagunero town of Torreón, Coahuila, Mexico. While in school Cisneros met and befriended José Eusebio Vázquez Bernal, a {{friendship}} that was <b>close</b> <b>that</b> they considered each other's brothers. The friendship between the two {{was so strong that}} Cisneros' parents considered Vázquez as one of their own children. After leaving school they both went their separate ways, not seeing each other for two years, before they both ended up training at the same boxing gym where Cisnero met with some success as a Golden Gloves boxer. Cisnero was also an avid cyclist, having participated in the first ever Vuelta Coahula bicycle race. Late in life he credited training as a boxer and cyclist for his stamina in the ring.|$|E
5|$|Jacques Le Gris {{was born}} in the 1330s, the son of a minor Norman squire Guillaume Le Gris. Unusually for the time, he was educated, taking minor orders as a cleric in the church and able to read {{sufficiently}} well to officiate at mass. Like his father, Le Gris was first a man-at-arms and then squire {{in the service of the}} Count of Perche, a role at which he excelled. He also participated in several minor military campaigns in Normandy in the entourage of Robert d'Alençon. In 1370 his long service was rewarded when he was given command of one of his liege lord's castles at the village of Exmes. During his career, he became firm friends with Jean de Carrouges, another squire in the Count's service. Carrouges and Le Gris were so <b>close</b> <b>that</b> in 1377, the same year that Count Robert died, Carrouges made Le Gris godfather to his eldest son, a position of great responsibility and trust.|$|E
5|$|Lhermitte {{had little}} {{subsequent}} success, and Preneuse returned to Port Louis in early December 1799. The {{entrance to the}} port was blockaded by the 74-gun ship of the line HMS Tremendous under Captain John Osborn (Royal Navy officer)and the 50-gun HMS Adamant under Captain William Hotham. These ships had been sent specifically to intercept Preneuse, arriving at Port Louis on 7 December and successfully intercepting the merchant French vessels Benjamin and Bienfait and the Spanish Nuestra Señora del Carmen. Four days later they sighted the approaching frigate and chased it northeast, Adamant pressing so <b>close</b> <b>that</b> Lhermitte could not escape {{and was forced to}} drive the frigate on shore {{at the mouth of the}} Tombeau River within range of a large shore battery.|$|E

5|$|Once {{posted to}} France in December 1914, the Rhodesian Platoon almost {{immediately}} began suffering regular heavy casualties. Southern Rhodesian volunteers continued to arrive piecemeal in England throughout the conflict, so Rhodesian formations on the Western Front received regular reinforcements in small batches, but because casualties were usually concentrated in far larger groups it often {{took a few}} months for a depleted Southern Rhodesian unit to return to full numerical strength. A cycle developed whereby Rhodesian platoons in Belgium and France were abruptly decimated and then gradually built up again only to suffer the same fate on returning to action. When the KRRC's Rhodesian platoons took part in British offensives, they were easily recognised by a distinctive battle cry that their men shouted as they went over the top. Sometimes the British and German positions were so <b>close</b> <b>that</b> troopers on each front line could hear what was said in the opposite trench; one group of Southern Rhodesians avoided being understood in this situation by speaking a mixture of Shona and Sindebele (two African languages) instead of English.|$|E
5|$|Other {{candidates}} in the Democratic field included sitting lieutenant governor Thelma Stovall, Terry McBrayer (the choice of sitting governor Julian Carroll), congressman Carroll Hubbard, state auditor George Adkins, and Louisville mayor Harvey Sloane. Initially the leading candidate, Stovall was hampered during the campaign by ill health. During the campaign, Brown was attacked by McBrayer for refusing to release his federal tax returns. McBrayer also claimed that Brown had not voted in a Democratic primary since 1975, a charge validated by public voting records. Nevertheless, Brown won the primary {{by a margin of}} 25,000 votes. The race was so <b>close</b> <b>that</b> Sloane, Brown's closest competitor, refused to concede for two days. Brown defeated former Republican governor Louie B. Nunn in the 1979 general election by a vote of 554,083 to 376,809.|$|E
5|$|Theta Muscae is {{a triple}} star system {{thought to be}} around 7,500light-years distant. It {{consists}} of a spectroscopic binary system composed of the Wolf–Rayet star (spectral type: WC5 or 6) and an O-type main-sequence star (spectral type: O6 or O7) that orbit each other every 19 days and a blue supergiant (spectral type: O9.5/B0Iab) set about 46milliarcseconds apart from them. If the system's estimated distance from Earth is accurate, the binary stars are about 0.5astronomical units (AU) apart and the supergiant about 100AU apart from them. All three are highly luminous: combined, {{they are likely to}} be over a million times as luminous as the Sun. TU Muscae is a binary star system located around 15,500light-years away made up of two hot luminous blue main sequence stars of spectral types O7.5V and O9.5V, with masses 23 and 15times that of the Sun. The stars are so <b>close</b> <b>that</b> they are in contact with each other (overcontact binary) and are classed as a Beta Lyrae variable as their light varies from Earth as they eclipse each other. The system ranges from apparent magnitude 8.17 to 8.75 over around 1.4days.|$|E

5|$|This {{ship was}} the 74-gun Hercule under Captain Louis L'Héritier, newly {{commissioned}} at Lorient and sailing to Brest {{to join the}} main French fleet and the British squadron immediately changed direction to intercept the new target. Facing overwhelming odds L'Héritier attempted to escape through the narrow Raz de Sein passage, but found the tide against him and so anchored {{at the mouth of}} the passage to await the British attack. At 21:15 Mars reached Hercule, coming under heavy fire as Hood manoeuvred into position, bringing his ship crashing alongside the French vessel. For more than an hour the ships fired directly into one another, so <b>close</b> <b>that</b> their guns could not be run out but had to be fired from inside the ships. Damage and casualties were severe on both sides, the latter including Hood who was mortally wounded at the height of the engagement.|$|E
5|$|U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps {{set a new}} Olympic {{record of}} 50.58 to defend his title in the event, edging out Serbia's Milorad Čavić (50.59) by one {{hundredth}} of a second (0.01). He also earned his seventh Olympic gold at a single Games, tying Mark Spitz's 1972 record for the most gold medals. Australia's Andrew Lauterstein earned a bronze in 51.12, finishing in a close race against world record holder Ian Crocker by the slimmest margin. Phelps' triumph occurred after Čavić had remarked {{that it would be}} better for the sport if Phelps was defeated.
