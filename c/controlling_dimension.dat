5000|$|Pipe sizes can be {{confusing}} because the terminology {{may relate to}} historical dimensions. For example, a half-inch iron pipe {{does not have any}} dimension that is a half inch. Initially, a half inch pipe did have an inner diameter of 0.5 in—but it also had thick walls. As technology improved, thinner walls became possible, but the outside diameter stayed the same so it could mate with existing older pipe, increasing the inner diameter beyond half an inch. The history of copper pipe is similar. In the 1930s, the pipe was designated by its internal diameter and a 1/16 in wall thickness. Consequently, a 1 in copper pipe had a 1+1/8 in outside diameter. The outside diameter was the important dimension for mating with fittings. The wall thickness on modern copper is usually thinner than 1/16 in, so the internal diameter is only [...] "nominal" [...] rather than a <b>controlling</b> <b>dimension.</b> [...] Newer pipe technologies sometimes adopted a sizing system as its own. PVC pipe uses the Nominal Pipe Size.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{contrary}} to several empirical contributions we report {{a positive and}} significant influence of schooling investment on the long run growth of the Italian regions in the period 1963 - 1995. This result is obtained when {{the unemployment rate is}} added as an additional <b>controlling</b> <b>dimension.</b> In the theoretical part of the paper we propose a growth model that could account for these empirical results. The model is built on the idea that the accumulation of human capital is a learning-by-doing process where scholastic knowledge must be combined with working experience. The dynamic steady state of the model implies a negative relationship between long run growth and equilibrium unemployment rate. The transitional dynamics of the model implies an asymmetric convergence path. Economies starting with a relative human capital shortage converge at a slower speed toward the steady state growth than economies starting with a relative physical capital shortage. The dynamics of the model appears to be coherent with the basic stylized facts characterizing the Italian regional development...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} grow {{crystals}} of desired dimensions {{is an important}} aspect of the design of new functional materials. The crystals grown in two dimensions enable successful and efficient modification {{of a wide range of}} physical, electronic and structural properties tailored for smaller and more efficient electronics, optoelectronics, valleytronics, and spintronic applications. The control of phases in crystals is also an additional element in the design of functional materials. Two-dimensional (2 D) atomic crystals can crystallize in a variety of crystal phases, which possess distinct properties. Therefore, identifying approaches for <b>controlling</b> <b>dimension</b> and crystal phase is essential for tuning the properties of 2 D materials to specific applications. Herein, various unique methods of producing 2 D atomic layered metal chalcogenide crystals (LMCs) including growth of group VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) by chalcogenization of pre-deposited metal-containing precursors, and phase-engineered growth of group IV LMCs by vapor-phase reaction of metal oxide and chalcogen powders are demonstrated. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) are all notable experimental techniques used to characterize these various materials.

40|$|A famous open problem {{asks whether}} the {{asymptotic}} dimension of a CAT(0) group is necessarily finite. For hyperbolic groups, {{it is known}} that asymptotic dimension of the group is bounded above by the dimension of the boundary plus one, which is known to be finite. For CAT(0) groups, the latter quantity is also known to be finite, so one approach is to try proving a similar inequality. So far those efforts have failed. Motivated by these questions we work toward understanding the relationship between large scale dimension of CAT(0) groups and small scale dimension of the group's boundary by shifting attention to the linearly <b>controlled</b> <b>dimension</b> of the boundary. To do that, one must choose appropriate metrics for the boundaries. In this paper, we suggest two candidates and develop some basic properties. Under one choice, we show that linearly <b>controlled</b> <b>dimension</b> of the boundary remains finite; under another choice, we prove that macroscopic dimension of the group is bounded above by twice the linearly <b>controlled</b> <b>dimension</b> of the boundary plus one.

40|$|Objective The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to compare plate with bulk trolley food service in hospitals in terms of patient satisfaction. Key factors distinguishing satisfaction with each system would also be identified. Methods A consumer opinion card (n = 180), concentrating on the quality indicators of core foods, was used to measure patient satisfaction and compare two systems of delivery, plate and trolley. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to build a model that would predict food service style {{on the basis of the}} food attributes measured. Further investigation used multinomial logistic regression to predict opinion for the assessment of each food attribute within food service style. Results Results showed that the bulk trolley method of food distribution enables all foods to have a more acceptable texture, and for some foods (potato, P = 0. 007; poached fish, P = 0. 001; and minced beef, P ≤ 0. 0005) temperature, and for other foods (broccoli, P ≤ 0. 0005; carrots, P ≤ 0. 0005; and poached fish, P = 0. 001) flavor, than the plate system of delivery, where flavor is associated with bad opinion or dissatisfaction. A model was built indicating patient satisfaction with the two service systems. Conclusion This research confirms that patient satisfaction is enhanced by choice at the point of consumption (trolley system); however, portion size was not the <b>controlling</b> <b>dimension.</b> Temperature and texture were the most important attributes that measure patient satisfaction with food, thus defining the focus for hospital food service managers. To date, a model predicting patient satisfaction with the quality of food as served has not been proposed, and as such this work adds to the body of knowledge in this field. This report brings new information about the service style of dishes for improving the quality of food and thus enhancing patient satisfaction...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work has been {{to shed light on}} the science of education, {{primarily}} in the period 1948 - 1971. The work also consists of the establishment of education as an academic discipline (1910 - 1948). The theoretical frame of reference is Kuhn's theory about the structure of scientific revolutions. The dissertation consists of two main parts: in the first part a paradigm analysis is treated, where some theoretical considerations are applied with a view {{to examine the effects of}} external factors on educational research. The purpose of the paradigm analysis was partly to identify and describe any prevailing system of scientific norms and values that may exist, and partly to characterize the outcome of the. analysis in terms of the theory of scientific revolutions. The total scientific production, descriptions of model studies and model examples made up the three materials that were subjected to an analysis with a view to finding out the nature of the underlying paradigm. The analyses of these three material indicated,both individually and in combination, that educational research during the period in question was dominated by one system of norms and values: a neobehaviouristic one. It also turned out to be possible to distinguish one approach as deviating from the others, viz. the hermeneutic approach. The conclusion was that educational research, visavi the theory of paradigm, was in a multiparadigmatic phase. But we could also observe variations of approaches within the framework of the predominating paradigm. We took this state of affairs as a point of departure for theoretical considerations about the status of paradigm in the social sciences. The basis for this policy was Kuhn's claim that paradigm is the most <b>controlling</b> <b>dimension</b> during phases of normal science. Therefore we examined the relationship between internal and external factors within the predominating paradigm in order to shed light on the principal question as to what the main impetus of the development in Swedish educational research had been. After several analyses the question was answered in the following manner. The existence of a predominant scientific system of norms and values probably constituted one of the main prerequisites of a massive concentration on educational research. However, external circumstances gradually developed for this system of values new problems in the way of analysis. In this way the nature of educational research changed from a concentration on psychometry to a. concentration on "school research". This state of affairs has also probably implied that the scientific ambition of educational research was gradually changed from descriptive and expository reports towards official reports on questions that are important for the authorities. digitalisering@um...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine how}} the library user emerges {{in the context of}} the LibQUAL+ {{application}} in Sweden in 2004. Design/methodology/approach: The paper examines the following aspects: how the information <b>control</b> <b>dimension</b> is depicted in the results of the Swedish participants; how the information <b>control</b> <b>dimension</b> compares between the Swedish implementation and other libraries; the "new user" as he emerges from the comments that support the notion of the self-sufficient, independent, and autonomous information seeker at Lund University; and the new users as reflected in the linguistic translation issues of the LibQUAL+ survey instrument in Swedish. Findings: Library users in Sweden have indicated that the information <b>control</b> <b>dimension</b> is an important one to them and this is the one dimension where libraries are not faring well. This finding is replicated in other non-Swedish libraries. In terms of the comments provided, 372 LibQUAL+ comments (most of them in Swedish) were analyzed and they all show the importance of self-sufficiency.
