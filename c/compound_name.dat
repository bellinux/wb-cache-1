25|$|Regarding the Illyrian toponyms and {{personal}} names like Vescleves, Acrabanus, Gentius, Clausal, {{the supporters of}} the Centum character of the Illyrian language have tried to explain those names through comparison with other old documented IE languages, such as Sanksrit or Ancient Greek or reconstructed PIE. For example, Vescleves has been explained as PIE *wesu-ḱlewes (of good fame). Also, the name Acrabanus as a <b>compound</b> <b>name</b> has been compared with Ancient Greek /akros/ with no signs of palatalization, or Clausal has been related to /*klew/ (wash, rinse).|$|E

25|$|French {{people have}} one, {{two or more}} given names (first names). One of them (nowadays almost always the first, in the past often the last) is used in daily life (but someone can also choose a usage name that was not given); the others are solely for {{official}} documents, such as passport, birth, death and marriage certificates. Thus, one always speaks of Jacques Chirac and never of Jacques René Chirac; and Henri Philippe Pétain is always referred to as Philippe Pétain (or Marshal Pétain), because Philippe was the given name that he used in daily life. Middle names in the Anglo-Saxon sense do not exist, and middle initials are never used for second or further given names. For example, although English-speaking scientific publications may cite Claude Allègre as Claude J. Allègre, this is never done in France. Typically, second and further given names may be somewhat old-fashioned, given in honour of the child's grandparents etc., though such practice has now become less common. As with English, however, a person may choose to use any one (or several) of their names, relegating the unused names to the birth certificate. Although using more than one name is nowadays out of fashion, using two or even three of the given names as a <b>compound</b> <b>name</b> was fairly common until the early 20th century.|$|E
500|$|Another {{possibility}} {{is that it is}} derived from a Brittonic patronym *Arto-rīg-ios (the root of which, *arto-rīg- [...] "bear-king" [...] {{is to be found in}} the Old Irish personal name Art-ri) via a Latinized form Artōrius. Less likely is the commonly proposed derivation from Welsh arth [...] "bear" [...] + (g)wr [...] "man" [...] (earlier *Arto-uiros in Brittonic); there are phonological difficulties with this theory—notably that a Brittonic <b>compound</b> <b>name</b> *Arto-uiros should produce Old Welsh *Artgur and Middle/Modern Welsh *Arthwr and not Arthur (in Welsh poetry the name is always spelled Arthur and is exclusively rhymed with words ending in -ur – never words ending in -wr – which confirms that the second element cannot be wr [...] "man").|$|E

50|$|The MSEA {{web server}} is a freely {{available}} web server for performing metabolite set enrichment analysis on human or mammalian metabolomics data. The required input {{is either a}} list of <b>compound</b> <b>names</b> or <b>compound</b> <b>names</b> and concentrations. The output {{is a set of}} graphs and tables with embedded hyperlinks to the pertinent pathway images and descriptors. The Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis offered by the web server is based on a curated library of more 5000 predefined metabolite sets covering various human metabolic pathways (nearly 100), hundreds of human disease states (in 3 different biofluids), human biofluid and tissue locations as well as human SNP-metabolite associations (4500 different SNP associations). MSEA also allows users to upload custom metabolite sets for more specialized analysis (such as non-mammalian MSEA work). Three different enrichment analyses are supported by the server: 1) overrepresentation analysis (ORA); 2) single sample profiling (SSP) and 3) quantitative enrichment analysis (QEA). ORA analysis only needs a list of <b>compound</b> <b>names.</b> SSP and QEA need both <b>compound</b> <b>names</b> and their concentrations. Workflows, examples and other screenshot tutorials on how to use the server are available on the MSEA website. The MSEA server also offers a number of other functions including the conversion between metabolite common names, synonyms, and major database identifiers.|$|R

2500|$|The name {{videophone}} {{is not as}} standardized as {{its earlier}} counterpart, the telephone, resulting {{in a variety of}} names and terms being used worldwide, and even within the same region or country. [...] Videophones are also known as videotelephones (or video telephones) and often by an early trademarked name [...] "Picturephone", which was the world's first commercial videophone produced in volume. The <b>compound</b> <b>name</b> [...] "videophone" [...] slowly entered into general use after 1950, although [...] "video telephone" [...] likely entered the lexicon earlier after [...] "video" [...] was coined in 1935. Videophone calls (also: videocalls and video chat), differ from videoconferencing in that they expect to serve individuals, not groups. However that distinction has become increasingly blurred with technology improvements such as increased bandwidth and sophisticated software clients that can allow for multiple parties on a call. In general everyday usage the term videoconferencing is now frequently used instead of videocall for point-to-point calls between two units. Both videophone calls and videoconferencing are also now commonly referred to as a video link.|$|E
2500|$|The {{policy of}} the Great Trigonometric Survey was to use local names for {{mountains}} wherever possible and K1 {{was found to be}} known locally as Masherbrum. K2, however, appeared not to have acquired a local name, possibly due to its remoteness. The mountain is not visible from Askole, the last village to the south, or from the nearest habitation to the north, and is only fleetingly glimpsed {{from the end of the}} Baltoro Glacier, beyond which few local people would have ventured. The name Chogori, derived from two Balti words, chhogo ("big") and ri ("mountain") (چھوغوری) has been suggested as a local name, but evidence for its widespread use is scant. It may have been a <b>compound</b> <b>name</b> invented by Western explorers or simply a bemused reply to the question [...] "What's that called?" [...] It does, however, form the basis for the name Qogir (...) by which Chinese authorities officially refer to the peak. Other local names have been suggested including Lamba Pahar ("Tall Mountain" [...] in Urdu) and Dapsang, but are not widely used.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} Old English {{word for}} a horse was eoh. Eoh derives from the Proto-Indo-European base *ekwo, hence Latin equus which {{gave rise to the}} modern English words equine and equestrian. Hors is derived from the Proto-Indo-European base *kurs, to run, which also gave rise to hurry, carry and current (the last two as borrowings from French). Hors eventually replaced eoh, fitting a pattern elsewhere in Germanic languages where the original names of sacred animals are abandoned in favour of adjectives; for example, the word bear. While the Ecclesiastical History and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle refer to the brother as Horsa, in the History of the Britons his name is simply Hors. It has been suggested that Horsa may be a pet form of a <b>compound</b> <b>name</b> with the first element [...] "horse". [...] Alternatively, it has also been suggested that these may have been given names or status titles within their tribe. [...] It is possible that the tribe had horses as a totem animal, perhaps even sailing with ships emblazoned with horse figureheads. By tradition the brothers arrived with a banner of a white horse, which is preserved to this day as the emblem of Kent.|$|E

2500|$|Francesca Fiore (Thompson) and Bruno Puntz Jones (Foley) are {{a pair of}} fast-living, glamorous movie stars. Though they {{originally}} {{hail from}} South America, their films have a decidedly European flavor. Francesca Fiore is fiery and passionate, and tends to be overdramatic and expressive in her actions. Bruno Puntz Jones (who always wears a white suit and a Panama hat) is very cool and reserved, but inwardly seems to share Francesca's spirit. Bruno occasionally likes to play Russian Roulette alone, a practice he refers to dismissively as [...] "my little game". He is also prone to shooting people {{with little or no}} warning, usually when he feels Francesca is being threatened. The two always play lovers in their films together; they seem to be romantically involved in real life as well, though the exact relationship between them is not made clear. In court, where Francesca was facing divorce (for a fake marriage to gain Canadian citizenship) from Mr. Tisane (another recurring character), Bruno revealed he and she were married when he was 12 and she was 26. According to the crew, Foley's character was originally named Bruno Puntz, but when the writers decided to change his last name to Jones, they wrote the word [...] "Jones" [...] in without deleting [...] "Puntz", accidentally creating a <b>compound</b> <b>name.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Compound given names, such as Jean-Luc, Jean-Paul, or Anne-Sophie are not uncommon. These are not {{considered}} to be two separate given names. The second part of a <b>compound</b> <b>name</b> may be a given name normally used by the opposite sex. However, the gender of the compound is determined by the first component. Thus, Marie-George Buffet has a given name considered as female because it begins with Marie, and George is spelled with a final -e like all the traditional French female given names, instead of Georges with -es for a male. The feminine component in male compound names is mostly Marie, as in Jean-Marie Vianney. In the past, some Frenchmen would have Marie or Anne as first name (example: Anne du Bourg), which is still nowadays in [...] practice in rare traditional Catholic families (but then the man will have other given names and one of those will be used in everyday life). Second or third given names, which usually are kept private, may also include names normally used by the opposite gender. For instance, in 2006, 81 Frenchmen have Brigitte among their given names, 97 Catherine, 133 Anne, and 204 Julie. In addition to the above-described custom of using Marie for males, {{this is due to the}} habit of traditional Catholic French families to give children the names of their godmother and godfather: if there is no counterpart of the opposite gender for the name of the godparent who is not of the same sex as the child, generally the name of the godparent will be left as such. For instance, a male child born to a traditional Catholic family choosing for him the name Nicolas and whose godparents are called Christian and Véronique could be called Nicolas Christian Marie Véronique.|$|E

60|$|But {{where the}} {{characters}} {{which must be}} taken into consideration, in order sufficiently to designate the Kind, are too numerous to be all signified in the derivation of the name, and where no one of them is of such preponderant importance as to justify its being singled out to be so indicated, we may avail ourselves of a subsidiary resource. Though we can not indicate the distinctive properties of the Kind, we may indicate its nearest natural affinities, by incorporating into its name the name of the proximate natural group of which {{it is one of the}} species. On this principle is founded the admirable binary nomenclature of botany and zoology. In this nomenclature the name of every species consists of the name of the genus, or natural group next above it, with a word added to distinguish the particular species. The last portion of the <b>compound</b> <b>name</b> is sometimes taken from some one of the peculiarities in which that species differs from others of the genus; as Clematis integrifolia, Potentilla alba, Viola palustris, Artemisia vulgaris; sometimes from a circumstance of an historical nature, as Narcissus poeticus, Potentilla tormentilla (indicating that the plant is that which was formerly known by the latter name), Exacum Candollii (from the fact that De Candolle was its first discoverer); and sometimes the word is purely conventional, as Thlaspi bursapastoris, Ranunculus thora; it is of little consequence which; since the second, or, as it is usually called, the specific name, could at most express, independently of convention, no more than a very small portion of the connotation of the term. But by adding to this the name of the superior genus, we may make the best amends we can for the impossibility of so contriving the name as to express all the distinctive characters of the Kind. We make it, at all events, express as many of those characters as are common to the proximate natural group in which the Kind is included. If even those common characters are so numerous or so little familiar as to require a further extension of the same resource, we might, instead of a binary, adopt a ternary nomenclature, employing not only the name of the genus, but that of the next natural group in order of generality above the genus, commonly called the Family. This was done in the mineralogical nomenclature proposed by Professor Mohs. “The names framed by him were not composed of two, but of three elements, designating respectively the Species, the Genus, and the Order; thus he has such species as Rhombohedral Lime Haloide, Octohedral Fluor Haloide, Prismatic Hal Baryte.”(226) The binary construction, however, has been found sufficient in botany and zoology, the only sciences in which this general principle has hitherto been successfully adopted in the construction of a nomenclature.|$|E
