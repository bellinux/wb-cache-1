This is accompanied by agitation in some cases. In this process the chlorophyll in the leaves is enzymatically broken down, and its tannins are released or transformed.

The tea producer may choose when the oxidation should be stopped, which depends on the desired qualities in the final tea as well as the weather conditions (heat and humidity). For light oolong teas this may be anywhere from 5-40% oxidation, in darker oolong teas 60-70%, and in black teas 100% oxidation. Oxidation is highly important in the formation of many taste and aroma compounds, which give a tea its liquor <b>colour,</b> <b>strength,</b> and briskness. Depending on the type of tea desired, under or over-oxidation/fermentation can result in grassy flavours, or overly thick winey flavours.|$|E
60|$|Turning {{to animals}} we find equally {{striking}} examples. If we want any special quality in any animal {{we have only}} to breed it in sufficient quantities and watch carefully, and the required variety is always found, and can be increased to almost any desired extent. In Sheep, we get flesh, fat, and wool; in Cows, milk; in Horses, <b>colour,</b> <b>strength,</b> size, and speed; in Poultry, we have got almost any variety of colour, curious modifications of plumage, and the capacity of perpetual egg-laying. In Pigeons we have a still more remarkable proof of the universality of variation, for it has been {{at one time or}} another the fancy of breeders to change the form of every part of these birds, and they have never found the required variations absent. The form, size, and shape of bill and feet, have been changed to such a degree as is found only in distinct genera of wild birds; the number of tail feathers has been increased, a character which is generally one of the most permanent nature, and is of high importance in the classification of birds; and the size, the colour, and the habits, have been also changed to a marvellous extent. In Dogs, the degree of modification and the facility with which it is effected, is almost equally apparent. Look at the constant amount of variation in opposite directions that must have been going on, to develop the poodle and the greyhound from the same original stock! Instincts, habits, intelligence, size, speed, form, and colour, have always varied, so as to produce the very races which the wants or fancies or passions of men may have led them to desire. Whether they wanted a bull-dog to torture another animal, a greyhound to catch a hare, or a bloodhound to hunt down their oppressed fellow-creatures, the required variations have always appeared.|$|E

2500|$|These {{data are}} {{measured}} through spectrophotometry reports at certified testing laboratories worldwide. Higher absorbances imply {{greater levels of}} crocin, picrocrocin and safranal, and thus a greater colouring potential and therefore strength per gram.

Saffron's <b>colouring</b> <b>strength</b> can range from lower than 80 (for all category IV saffron) up to 200 or greater (for category I). The world's finest samples (the selected, most red-maroon, tips of stigmas picked from the finest flowers) receive <b>colouring</b> <b>strengths</b> in excess of 250, making such saffron over three times more powerful than category IV saffron. Market prices for saffron types follow directly from these ISO categories. Sargol and coupé saffron would typically fall into ISO 3632 category I.

Among the selected fabrics, maximum <b>colour</b> <b>strength</b> values (K/S) 0.739 and 0.736 were recorded in pashmina fabric using Salix alba and Populus deltoides in post-mordanting method (Fig.  1 a, b), whereas, the lowest value (0.662) was recorded with Salix alba in simultaneous mordanting, highest <b>colour</b> <b>strength</b> (0.689) was recorded in wool fabric with Salix alba in post-mordanting and lowest value (0.602) was recorded with Populus deltoides in simultaneous mordanting.

Silk fabric exhibited the highest value of 0.695 with Populus deltoides in post-mordanting (Fig.  2 b), while the lowest value (0.555) was recorded with Salix alba in pre- and post-mordanting (Fig.  2 a). The pashmina fabric recorded the maximum K/S value followed by the wool, silk and cotton fabrics.

The lower values of the <b>colour</b> <b>strength</b> of the cotton fabric can be related to the unsaturated moiety of the natural dyes bearing ionizable hydroxyl and carboxylic groups.
