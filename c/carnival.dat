5|$|Nevertheless, Antillean {{music can}} be {{characterized}} by the prominence of the <b>Carnival</b> celebration (prominently from Trinidad and Tobago), {{and the importance of}} calypso-like song traditions. The Lesser Antilles is also home to a strong Indo-Caribbean population; though Indo-Caribbean music is found elsewhere in the Caribbean, the prominence of Indian-influenced styles is a hallmark of the Antillean music scenes. Regional forms can also be found outside of the Caribbean entirely, most notably in New York City, where Brooklyn's Labor Day <b>Carnival</b> features music and parades, mas and steel bands; this <b>Carnival</b> is distinct to New York, and reflects elements of a pan-Caribbean nature.|$|E
5|$|The Caribbean <b>Carnival</b> is an {{important}} part of Dominican culture. Originally featuring masquerade songs (chanté mas) and other local traditions, traditional <b>Carnival,</b> Mas Domnik, came to be dominated by imported calypso music and steel bands in the early 1960s; calypso appealed to Carnival-goers because the lyrical focus on local news and gossip was similar to that of chanté mas, despite a rhythmic pattern and instrumentation which contrast sharply with traditional Dominican Mas Domnik music. After a fire in 1963, the traditional <b>Carnival</b> was banned, though calypso and steelpan continued to grow in popularity. Modern <b>Carnival</b> on Dominica takes place on the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, and is a festive occasion during which laws against libel and slander are suspended. The modern Dominican <b>Carnival</b> is heavily based on the Trinidadian celebration, but is not as commercialized due to a lack of corporate sponsorship.|$|E
