40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the experiences of}} white and non-white college students with the financial aid process and financial aid office and staff. The study used a 20 -item survey administered {{to a sample of}} 710 student financial aid recipients. Questions covered procedural and informational aspects of the financ;:l aid process, accessibility and comfort with the staff, and overall satisfaction with their financial aid experience. Findings revealed few differences in the responses of White and non-White aid recipients except that non-whites felt they had greater difficulty getting an appointment with a Financial Aid counselor than did White respondents. White and non-White students both gave highly positive ratings concerning their overall satisfaction with their experience. More interesting patterns emerged when non-White students were separated into different ethnic groups. When the responses of students representing six ethnic groups were compared, the findings included the following: Native Americans had consistently lower satisfaction levels; Chicano respondents were more satisfied even than Whites; statistically significant differences existed between the Native Americans and Asian students on the reasonableness of the aid package.

Since tetrasomy 18 p is uncommon, there is currently little, if any, research explaining benefits of Therapeutic Recreation (TR) specifically to those with the disorder, but TR is able to address specific symptoms of the disorder. This case study focuses on a 15 -year-old girl named Emily who is diagnosed with mild cerebral palsy {{in addition to a}} diagnosis of tetrasomy 18 p. Emily has very supportive parents who want her to succeed as well as a supportive step-sister. Current assessments conducted by the Colorado Springs Therapeutic Recreation Program (TRP) measure her physical, social, emotional, and cognitive skills as they relate the TR. Goals have been written for Emily the past eight years she has attended summer day camps with the TRP. This past year, Emily did not meet her goals at camp to follow multi-step directions with minimal to moderate assistance, or display socially appropriate behavior with 1 - 2 prompts. According to an assessment by the TRP, the Program Outcome Attainment Scale, Emily did not improve or decline in any areas over the summer of 2015.

40|$|Maternal death review (MDR) is an {{accepted}} {{process that is}} implemented across Malawi and ‘underlying cause of death’ is assigned by healthcare providers using a standard MDR form. Mixed-methods approach. Key informant interviews with eight stakeholders involved in MDR. Secondary analysis of MDR forms for 54 maternal deaths. Comparison of assigned cause of death by healthcare providers conducting MDR at health facility level with cause assigned by researchers using the International Classification of Diseases Maternal Mortality (ICD-MM) classification. MDR teams, analysts and policymakers reported facing challenges in <b>completing</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms,</b> analysing and using information. The concepts of underlying (primary) and contributing (secondary) causes of death are often misunderstood. Healthcare providers using only MDR forms reported cause of death as non-obstetric complications in 39. 6 % and pregnancy-related infection in 11. 3 % of cases. For 30. 2 % of cases, no clear clinical {{cause of death was}} recorded. The most commonly assigned underlying cause of death using ICD-MM was obstetric haemorrhage (32. 1 %), non-obstetric complications (24. 5 %) and pregnancy-related infection (22. 6 %). There was poor agreement between cause(s) of maternal death assigned by healthcare providers in the field and trained researchers using the new ICD-MM classification (κ statistic; 0. 219). The majority of cases could be reclassified using the ICD-MM and this provided a more specific cause of death. A more structured and user-friendly MDR form is required. Accurate classification of cause of death is important. Dissemination of, and training {{in the use of the}} new ICD-MM classification system will be helpful to healthcare providers conducting MDR in Malawi...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Increasingly, the {{experiences}} and perceptions of parents who decline vaccination {{are the subject of}} investigation. However, {{the experiences}} of clinicians who encounter these parents {{in the course of their}} work has received little academic attention to date. This study aimed to understand the challenges faced and strategies used when general practitioners and immunising nurses encounter parents who choose not to vaccinate their children. Methods Primary care providers were recruited from regions identified through the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR) as having higher than national average rates of registered objection to childhood vaccination. Interviews began with an exploration of provider experiences with parents who accept, are hesitant towards, and who decline vaccination. Participants were asked specifically about how they addressed any difficulties they encountered in their interactions. Thematic analysis focused on encounters with parents 2 ̆ 013 challenges and strategies. Results Twenty-six general practitioners (GPs), community and practice nurses (PNs) were interviewed across two regions in NSW, Australia. Providers 2 ̆ 019 sense of professional identity as health advocates and experts became conflicted in their encounters with vaccine objecting parents. Providers were dissatisfied when such consultations resulted in a 2 ̆ 018 therapeutic roadblock 2 ̆ 019 whereby provider-parent communication came to a standstill. There were mixed views about being asked to sign forms exempting parents from vaccinating their children. These ranged from a belief that <b>completing</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> rewarded parents for non-conformity to seeing it as a positive opportunity for engagement. Three common strategies were employed by providers to navigate through these challenges; 1) to explore and inform, 2) to mobilise clinical rapport and 3) to adopt a general principle to first do no harm to the therapeutic relationship. Conclusions Many healthcare providers find consultations with vaccine objecting parents challenging and some, particularly more experienced providers, employ successful strategies to address this. Primary care providers, especially those more junior, could benefit from additional communication guidance to better the outcome and increase the efficiency of their interactions with such parents...|$|E

30|$|We used {{lightweight}} ethnography, {{a social}} science approach allowing investigators to collect specific and relevant information efficiently while accepting {{the impossibility of}} a complete understanding of a work setting (Randall et al. 2007). Lightweight ethnography can provide guidelines for technology design as it is neither time nor resource intensive, and is well suited for pilot studies. One research assistant (AC) shadowed clinical pharmacists during 2 – 4  h data collection shifts. At {{the beginning of each}} observation shift, the research assistant presented pharmacists with <b>the</b> ADE <b>form</b> and explained <b>the</b> <b>form</b> functionality, as well as the scope of ADEs that it is aimed to capture. Pharmacists were asked to <b>complete</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> when an ADE was encountered. In addition to collecting ethnographic information, the research assistant recorded how long it took users to <b>complete</b> <b>the</b> <b>form,</b> from <b>the</b> moment they started filling it out to when it was ready to be submitted. The research assistant also recorded the types of information sources accessed and the number of internal and external interruptions to pharmacists’ work while <b>completing</b> <b>the</b> <b>form.</b> Internal interruptions were defined as instances where the user had to access another information source in order to <b>complete</b> <b>the</b> <b>form.</b> External interruptions were defined as instances where another person interrupted <b>the</b> user <b>completing</b> <b>the</b> ADE <b>form.</b> <b>The</b> research assistant recorded pharmacists’ comments and impressions during work, and subsequently completed semi-structured interviews with pharmacists about the diagnostic process, users’ perceptions of individual fields and <b>the</b> <b>form</b> as a whole, and challenges in documenting ADEs.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Linear {{programming}} is now widely accepted {{and used by}} researchers and industrial management people, but its adoption by farm managers has been slow. This study concentrates {{on the development of}} improved data transmittal techniques for farm organization linear programming. The program model is designed to analyze crop production alternatives. Models presently in use were studied for 1). restriction and activity format and 2). data transmittal input and output techniques. In spite of the availability of linear programming models, the lack of input and report generating programs has limited the application of linear programming as a practical farm management tool. Input forms and computer reports were designed for ease of use and interpretation by farm managers. The system was then programmed by the Oregon State University Computer Center and tested for practical application on a case farm. Various problems appeared which required a redesign of the forms and computer reports. A "Cooperators Manual" was then written to explain the system to potential users. After several program changes, the system was tested on six selected farms. The farmers completed the forms for their operations indicating the resources available and the crop activity coefficients. The farmers, after receiving the computer reports, completed a questionnaire stating their experiences and thoughts regarding this farm planning system. A record was kept of the farm manager's time in filling out the input forms. Computer processing cost for each farm was also recorded. The farm managers were generally quite receptive to this method of systematized budgeting. They all indicated that they planned to implement {{at least part of the}} suggested organization It was found that records, of some description, were needed in going through the process of <b>completing</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms.</b> County agents and published data can also be used in the information-gathering process. This study reveals that data transmittal techniques can be developed such that farm managers can communicate readily with the computer. Better communication will make other technical tools, in addition to linear programming, useful in modern farm business management...|$|E
40|$|Chronic pain is {{a global}} public health {{challenge}} and often underdiagnosed. While self-assessment scales are considered {{the gold standard for}} evaluation of pain, certain issues remain. Investigators disagree which scale ideally describes chronic pain due to the subjective nature of its perception and difficulty to score objective parameters for this complex experience. Pain scales were frequently validated with other scales. However, psychometric tests alone are probably unable to evaluate how well the individual pain experience of the respective patient is described by a scale. The patient perspective has received too little attention in previous studies. A substudy of a recent randomized controlled trial that investigated the efficacy of Qigong and physical therapy in elderly patients with chronic neck pain, evaluated the usability and validity of the questionnaires employed, particularly pain scales. Here we aimed to identify and describe the patient perspective on four validated scales: Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Neck Pain and Disability Scale (NPDS), General Depression Scale (ADS) and ShortForm 36 Questionnaire (SF- 36) using qualitative methodology. Patients were selected from both groups of the RCT, if their pain had worsened over a three month period compared to baseline according to the questionnaires. Twenty patients were included (100 % female, average age: 76. 2 ± 4. 52 years). Semi structured interviews were performed (average lengths: 37 ± 12. 14 min), transcribed and evaluated according to the Content Analysis by Mayring using Atlas/ti® software. Next, the information from the interviews was compared to the questionnaire results in order to identify possible discrepancies. Our results demonstrate that important aspects of patients personal experience concerning pain and therapy success could not be recorded by the scales used. This did not result from any technical difficulties <b>completing</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> but rather the inability to see their personal situation reflected by the items collected. Patients expressed concern about the request for average values and the potential false interpretation of their responses by researchers. To resolve this dilemma, they frequently added comments to the questionnaire. Most would have preferred a personal interview. In summary, we identified important limitations of scale based pain research. More research is needed to develop age adjusted instruments and better incorporation of the patients perspective...|$|E
