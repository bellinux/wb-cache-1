500|$|However, {{after the}} splendour of the premiere and the praise of some reviewers, when the Andersons {{departed}} {{on a tour}} of Britain to promote the film it was revealed that public interest was mediocre and box office revenue poor, as Gerry Anderson explains: [...] "When we got off the plane at the first destination we were told that the film was in trouble. Cinemas were apparently half-full. When we got to the next big city we got more news that made us even more depressed – box office figures were inexplicably low wherever we went." [...] Anderson proposes that the presence of Thunderbirds on television damaged the chances of its big-screen transfer, asserting, [...] "The only thing we <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> that at that time the audience was not used to seeing a feature film version of a television show. So people would see Thunderbirds and think, 'We've seen it on television.'" [...] Sylvia Anderson offers a similar explanation: [...] "Although we still had our loyal television fans, they remained just that – firmly seated in front of their television screens and not in the cinema." ...|$|E
500|$|Poppy {{initially}} {{appeared as}} a guest character in two episodes, broadcast on 11 and 13 January 2011, in [...] "filler" [...] scenes that were substituted for those cut from a controversial baby-swap storyline in which Ronnie Branning (Samantha Womack)'s son James dies of sudden infant death syndrome, and she secretly swaps him with Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace)'s son, Tommy. A spokeswoman for EastEnders claimed that {{although some of the}} baby-swap scenes had been edited in response to reaction from viewers, none had been removed: [...] "Given the audience response to this storyline, we felt on this occasion that it was appropriate to respond and make some changes. The vast majority of material remains intact and we don't believe that those trims we have made will weaken or detract from the overall storyline for viewers". In an interview with the Daily Mirror, Bright stated that her first scene was her favourite throughout her tenure, as [...] "all [...] <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>was,</b> 'I'm sitting on a bench in the Square!'" [...] Babbington, who played Jodie, revealed in May 2011 that Bright was to reprise her role. Bright made her return on 30 June 2011.|$|E
2500|$|On November 24, 2000, Madonna {{performed}} the latter songs live on French television program Nulle Part Ailleurs. Madonna then played another concert on November 29, 2000, at Brixton Academy in London. It was shown {{via the internet}} to an estimated record-breaking 9 million viewers across the world. The setlist was the same from the Roseland Ballroom's concert, with the song [...] "Holiday" [...] being added to the setlist. The singer Richard Ashcroft and the Scottish band Texas opened the concert. Madonna then performed [...] "Don't Tell Me" [...] on Carràmba! Che fortuna in Italy, on December 2, 2000. On February 21, 2001, she performed [...] "Music" [...] at the 43rd Grammy Awards. For the performance, the stage had five giant video screens, which showed images from her career. Madonna entered onto the stage in a classic Cadillac driven by rapper Bow Wow. The singer emerged {{from the back seat}} of the car in a full-length fur coat and a hat, quickly removing the clothes to reveal a tight leather jacket and jeans. She removed her jacket to reveal a black tank top with the words [...] "Material Girl" [...] printed on it. Host Jon Stewart commented right after, talking about how he was getting older and commenting, [...] "As I was watching Madonna writhing around on the hood of the car, all I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> — that’s really gonna drive up her insurance premiums".|$|E

5000|$|Each judge {{could make}} {{consistent}} (non-contradictory) judgments, and the paradox will still emerge. Most judges <b>could</b> <b>think</b> P <b>is</b> true, and most judges <b>could</b> <b>think</b> Q <b>is</b> true. In this example, {{that means they}} would vote that the caretaker probably mowed over the roses, and that the contract did indeed forbid that action. This suggests the caretaker is liable.|$|R

2500|$|In {{her teenage}} years, she {{was locked up}} in a Nigerian prison cell because of her femininity. Being imprisoned {{encouraged}} her to leave Nigeria, if she could not have left, the other option was to finally succeed in ending her life. She remembered her experiences in this poignant piece she wrote for Gay Star News on Transgender Day of Remembrance on 20 November 2013, which was re-published by some online news outlets:I wish I could tell the younger me who tried to commit suicide twice that life gets better and dreams do honestly come through. [...] I did not imagine life could be this amazing many years ago after being released from a horrid Nigerian prison for being different. Then all I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> I could die in this prison and no one will know or care. [...] Being imprisoned felt justifiable, considering I was being punished for being 'gay' as they assumed due to my feminine features and mannerisms. [...] I wasn't gay, I am a woman born differently due to natural defects. What I felt did not match my outward appearance. Being assigned male at birth doesn't make me a man or a woman, nobody was born a man or a woman, you are born male or female, then you develop into your preferred gender as you grow up thus making you a man or a woman. For me that gender was female. I was born male but my brain, gestures, features and carriage functioned as that of a female. Growing up and not knowing what was happening to my body made me confused and lost. I couldn't discuss it with my family because my femininity was frowned upon due to religion and I could not talk to my friends because they would not understand what I was going through. I found solace in music and dreams. I dreamt of being free to be myself, free of insults, free of judgment and free from harassments. Her experience with the Nigerian police made her to seek [...] in London, United Kingdom.|$|E

6000|$|Suddenly {{from the}} top of the cliff a bright light flashed. He looked at it {{sideways}} as he fought his way on, and saw the light rise and fall and flicker as the flames leaped. High over him he saw fantastic figures which seemed to dance on the edge of the high cliff. They had evidently noticed him, and were making signals of some sort; but what the motions were he could not see or understand, for they were but dark silhouettes, edged with light, against the background of fire. The only thing he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> that they meant to encourage him, and so he urged himself to further effort. It might be that help was at hand! ...|$|E

5000|$|Green Man is a persona {{assumed by}} Charlie wearing a green spandex suit in several episodes. The persona has spawned imitators, most notably at {{sporting}} events. Rob McElhenney adapted the idea {{after watching the}} Philadelphia Eagles defeat the Dallas Cowboys at Lincoln Financial Field. Without warning, {{in the parking lot}} after the game, a friend of McElhenney's stripped off his clothes and donned a full-body green spandex suit. McElhenney said: [...] "Everyone started chanting, 'Green Man! Green Man!' It went on for several hours, and all I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>was,</b> 'My God, {{there has to be a}} way I can take advantage of this on the show.' ...|$|E
60|$|Catherine <b>could</b> <b>think</b> {{of nothing}} of the kind, and Morris's {{luminosity}} seemed almost pitiless.

50|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} when released in 1973. Pauline Kael, the film critic for The New Yorker, {{suggested that if}} the best subject that Nichols and Henry <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of <b>was</b> talking dolphins, then they should quit making movies altogether.|$|R
5000|$|Tomar Tu's finale {{mission was}} the {{interception}} of Hal Jordan {{as he made}} his way to Oa. Tomar received transmissions as Hal Jordan paved a way to Oa by defeating Ke'Haan of Varva, General Kreon, Boodikka, Graf Toren, honor bound Laira and even rebellious Jack T. Chance. With each passing minute Tomar knew that the worst had happened; the greatest Green Lantern had turned renegade and was destroying the very corps he helped create. Tomar was no match for the more skilled Jordan and fell to his rage and might. He was then stripped of his ring and left for dead. As he drifted into what seemed to be oblivion all he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> [...] "kill Hal Jordan".|$|E
5000|$|The {{sessions}} at Monnow Valley were costing £800 a day. As the sessions proved increasingly fruitless, the group began to panic. Arthurs said, [...] "Noel was frantically {{on the phone}} to the management, going, 'This ain't working.' For it not to be happening was a bit frightening." [...] Batchelor was relieved of his duties, and Gallagher tried {{to make use of the}} music already recorded by taking the tapes to a number of London studios. Tim Abbot of Creation Records said while visiting the band in Chiswick, [...] "McGee, Noel, me and various people had a great sesh, and we listened to it over and over again. And all I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>was,</b> 'It ain't got the attack.' There was no immediacy." ...|$|E
5000|$|And {{then there}} was John Howard, and all I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> [...] "This is how it's done."

The songs have a slight glam, show-tunes touch, but they don’t feel dated or twee — instead, it's mood-enhancing music with a story to tell, songs that you feel you've known your whole life.|$|E
6000|$|Mr Thompson looked equally thoughtful. 'The {{circumstances}} are certainly very suspicious,' he said, echoing the Head's own words. 'I wish I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> he <b>was</b> innocent, but I am bound to say I do not. I regard the evidence as conclusive.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> it <b>were</b> not so. I {{have thought}} {{sometimes}} {{that it was}} this very pride, turning suddenly to madness, which drove him to it. You have heard how he returned the money which we had lost?" ...|$|R

5000|$|At {{one point}} during the pattabhisheka, the {{ceremony}} during which Baba Muktananda passed on to me {{the power of his}} lineage, he whispered soham and aham Brahmasmi in my ear. I experienced the mantra as an immensely powerful force which rocketed at lightning speed throughout my bloodstream and created an upheaval in my entire system. I instantly transcended body-consciousness and became aware that all distinctions such as inner and outer were false and artificial. Everything was the same; what was within me was also without. My mind became completely blank. There was only the pulsating awareness 'I am That,' accompanied by great bliss and light. When my mind again began to function, all I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>was,</b> 'What is Baba? Who is this being who looks so ordinary, yet has the capacity to transmit such an experience at will?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Joe Roth {{knew about}} John Grisham's Skipping Christmas {{before it was}} even {{published}} in 2001. He was asked by Grisham {{to read the book}} in galley form, assuming he could direct a movie based on it. Roth recalls: [...] "It turns out he was right. Even while I was reading it, all I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> that this would make a great Christmas movie. It had humor, it had wonderful characters and it had heart." [...] It was a huge change for him as he, who previously directed thrillers, would now do work for a film lighter in tone and style. With the rights of the book received and the May 2000 founding of Revolution Studios, he stated that [...] "as a start-up company, {{there was a great deal}} of work to do in order to get up and running." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "It was {{so fresh}} at the beginning... The public was more carried away. Obviously, I had the stage fright {{because of all}} those people, and this band was at the start.

5000|$|Film {{reporter}} David Chen {{shares a}} real-life twist related to Marc Schiller (portrayed onscreen as Victor Kershaw) that was {{excluded from the}} film: [...] "The Schiller Twist - Reading through Pete Collins’ Pain & Gain story, I thought I {{had a pretty good}} handle on the direction it was going in. I was shocked to discover that at the end, in an M. Night Shyamalan-like twist, the Kershaw character is arrested immediately after he testifies against the Sun Gym gang and charged with a fraudulent Medicare scheme that generated $14 million. It’s stunning and a little bit heartbreaking. As Collins writes, 'All he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> that State Attorney General had sold him out. For three years she had used him, forced him to relive every excruciating detail of his confinement: the starvation, the burns and electric shocks, the beatings, the abject terror, the absolute physical and psychological mortification. She had extracted everything she could, and then she had disposed of him.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Wicker was {{a witness}} to the Stonewall riots in June, 1969, which are {{recognized}} as the start of the modern gay liberation movement. He later recalled seeing rioters set bonfires and throw garbage barrels through the windows of Greenwich Village businesses. [...] "All I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>was,</b> Oh my God, they're going to burn up a little old Italian lady or some child is going to be killed and we're going to be the bogey-man of the seventies." [...] Despite his early activism, Wicker denounced the riots at a community organizational meeting a week later, saying that [...] "throwing rocks through windows doesn't open doors" [...] and dismissing [...] "disorderly" [...] behaviour as a means to social tolerance. He temporarily distanced himself from the gay movement, but returned in 1972 to co-author The Gay Crusaders, a compilation of profiles of early movement leaders, with Kay Lahusen (writing under the name [...] "Kay Tobin").|$|E

5000|$|The {{concept of}} agency has existed since the Enlightenment. René Descartes' phrase Cogito ergo sum stated {{that anyone who}} <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> an agent , and any agent capable of knowing that it can <b>think</b> <b>was</b> a subject. Immanuel Kant {{expanded}} on this theory by stating {{that the only way}} to truly become self-aware is to engage with the outside world. These definitions of agency remained mostly unquestioned until the nineteenth century, when philosophers began arguing that the choices humans make are dictated by forces beyond their control. For example, Karl Marx argued that in modern society, people were controlled by the ideologies of the bourgeoisie, and Friedrich Nietzsche argued that man made choices based on his own selfish desires, or the [...] "Will to Power." ...|$|R
