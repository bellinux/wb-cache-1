He is the brains behind managing to get the militant alien races such as the Vampires, the Lycanthropes, and the Banshee, to come together and form a coalition against the Alliance. He commands the flagship of the alien fleet that means to attack the bunker. He halts the attack right before they reach the Alliance when he sees that Walter Logan is alive.

5000|$|Shadoen: The Shadoen Multitude is {{a highly}} {{advanced}} hostile species that devote themselves to the enslavement and/or destruction of other races. They are an insectile/crustanean race divided into various castes and are led by an Elder Council on their homeworld. They are also known to be treacherous to both others and {{members of their own}} species as seen with Wraith's betrayal of Commander Keel. They also appear to be only able to inhabit planets with specific criteria such as Earth and are known to have an aversion to oxygen (a reason why they are responsible for instigating the deforestation of the Amazon), as stated in Episode 10 - Chupacabra. A common tactic that they use to subjugate a newly discovered planet is to use a combined fleet to fragment its moon with a laser while letting the fall out devastate the local species. Contrary to races such as the Lycanthropes - who have an innate mimetic system - or the Vampires - who use holographic technology - the Shadoen are not shapeshifters. In order to acquire the target race appearance, the Shadoen imprint their DNA and memories on a human clone, in so becoming an exact replica of the victim (which is also why Logan's eyes can't detect them). After the assimilation, the Shadoen can not freely morph to its former original shape, having to maintain the target guise or forfeit it by triggering a Shadoen DNA bomb. Once activated, the DNA bomb restores the agent to its full-fledged Shadoen form, permanently destroying the previous target guise in the process. This ability has permitted the Shadoen to successfully infiltrate human race. The Shadoen are by far more powerful and resilient than the other alien races seen on the show: they also possess a mild ability of regeneration, and their blood has a poisonous effect if ingested, as witnessed in Episode 10 - Chupacabra. They attempted to conquer Earth during the 15th century BC but their fleet was repulsed by a long range beam cannon sent to Earth by the Titani. Their second invasion is thwarted by the efforts of the new alien-human Alliance {{with the use of the}} Lycanthrope EMP bomb. First appearance: Episode 14 - The <b>Conduit</b> (<b>Part</b> 2).|$|E

40|$|Chronic hypoxia {{results in}} {{pulmonary}} hypertension due to vasoconstriction and structural remodelling of peripheral lung blood vessels. We hypothesize that vascular remodelling is initiated {{in the walls}} of prealveolar pulmonary arteries by collagenolytic metalloproteinases (MMP) released from activated mast cells. Distribution of mast cells and their expression of interstitial collagenase, MMP- 13, in lung conduit, small muscular, and prealveolar arteries was determined quantitatively in rats exposed for 4 and 20 days to hypoxia as well as after 7 -day recovery from 20 -day hypoxia (10 % O 2). Mast cells were identified using Toluidine Blue staining, and MMP- 13 expression was detected using monoclonal antibody. After 4, but not after 20 days of hypoxia, {{a significant increase in}} the number of mast cells and their MMP- 13 expression was found within walls of prealveolar arteries. In rats exposed for 20 days, MMP- 13 positive mast cells accumulated within the walls of conduit arteries and subpleurally. In recovered rats, MMP- 13 positive mast cells gathered at the prealveolar arterial level as well as in the walls of small muscular arteries; these mast cells stayed also in the <b>conduit</b> <b>part</b> of the pulmonary vasculature. These data support the hypothesis that perivascular pulmonary mast cells contribute to the vascular remodelling in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension in rats by releasing interstitial collagenase...|$|E
40|$|The first {{references}} to the Olisipo (Roman Lisbon) aqueduct date from the 16 th century and regard the Água Livre springs and the Belas roman dam. During the 17 th and 18 th centuries, whenever architects and engineers examined the way to supply Lisbon with water, they reported the existence of remains of an old <b>conduit,</b> <b>part</b> of which has lately been studied and presented in publications as the “Amadora roman aqueduct”. Despite such evidences, the lack of archeological proofs in Lisbon urban area has set back the discussion on the issue, so that some researchers consider the Olisipo aqueduct an utopia. With the support of known literary accounts, in particular the 17 th. century description of the roman aqueduct remains by the Italian architect Leonardo Turriano, and of the functional interpretation of archeological roman structures related to water, tests {{to find out the}} aqueduct route were developed through an innovative geographic modelling approach, applying various criteria such as an the spatial definition of an equipotential average slope gradient, common in the roman world, aiming to create a viable route for the water to be conveyed to both termini of the ancient town –Porta de Santo André and São Roque – referred to by Leonardo Turriano. Through these tests, the authors have shown the theoretical viability of the Olisipo water supply by the means of an aqueduct connected with the Amadora roman conduit remains. The potential aqueduct route runs close to Palhavã area, which matches the fact that aqueduct structures in this area are referred to in the 1758 Lisbon Parish Reports (Memórias Paroquiais de Lisboa). However, as it does not correspond to the route described by Turriano, the authors have developed new tests taking into account this architect’s topographical references in order to see if the Belas water could reach Porta de Santo André and São Roque. The modelling approach was based on the application of different terrain interpolation methods, with variable detail topographic input data and variable output resolution scales. As a development of previous work, new surfaces of topographic conditioning were generated, namely following an optimal abstract terrain elevation potential and a new conditioned terrain based in historical references and available archaeological evidence. The novel method integrates through a multi scale/resolution approach, a raster optimal path algorithm and a corridor viability scenario. For validation of the methods, several statistical indicators were calculated for the logistical probability functions implemented. Results demonstrate very high levels of significance and inherent adherence from archaeological evidence and generated potential paths to terrain based spatial variables.

40|$|A {{regional}} {{correlation of}} Neogene stratigraphy has been attempted along {{and across the}} NW European Atlantic continental margin, between Mid-Norway and SW Ireland. Two unconformity-bounded successions are recognised. These {{are referred to as}} the lower and upper Neogene successions, and have been dated as Miocene–early Pliocene and early Pliocene–Holocene, respectively, in age. Their development is interpreted to reflect plate-wide, tectonically driven changes in the sedimentary, oceanographic and latterly climatic evolution of the NE Atlantic region. The lower Neogene succession mainly preserves a record of deep-water sedimentation that indicates an expansion of contourite sediment drifts above submarine unconformities, within this succession, {{on both sides of the}} eastern Greenland–Scotland Ridge from the mid-Miocene. This is interpreted to record enhanced deep-water exchange through the Faroe <b>Conduit</b> (deepest <b>part</b> of the Southern Gateway), and can be linked to compressive inversion of the Wyville–Thomson Ridge Complex. Thus, a pervasive, interconnected Arctic–North Atlantic deep-water circulation system is a Neogene phenomenon. The upper Neogene succession records a regional change, at about 4 Ma, in the patterns of contourite sedimentation (submarine erosion, new depocentres) coeval with the onset of rapid seaward-progradation of the continental margin by up to 100 km. This build-out of the shelf and slope is inferred to record a marked increase in sediment supply in response to uplift and tilting of the continental margin. Associated changes in deep-water circulation may be part of an Atlantic-wide reorganisation of ocean bottom currents. Glacial sediments form a major component of the prograding shelf margin (shelf-slope) sediment wedges, but stratigraphic data indicate that the onset of progradation pre-dates significant high-latitude glaciation by at least 1 Ma, and expansive Northern Hemisphere glaciation by at least 3 Ma...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, it was {{proposed}} {{to convert the}} Conduit Boulevard route between Linden Boulevard and Laurelton Boulevard/Brookville Boulevard into a state parkway, with North and South Conduit Avenues created as service roads for the parkway. The purpose {{of the project was}} to create express highway links between Brooklyn and Long Island, via Linden Boulevard, Sunrise Highway, and the Southern State Parkway. The original 1931 plans, known as the Southern State Parkway extension, called for an arterial road adjacent to the existing narrow Sunrise Highway. Later plans called for a parkway. As early as July 1934, land was acquired via eminent domain to widen Conduit Boulevard and build the new parkway. The project would become the Southern Parkway section of the Belt Parkway, which would connect to the Belt system's Laurelton Parkway at Brookville Bouelvard and feed into the Southern State Parkway. In justifying the conversion of the <b>Conduit</b> route into <b>part</b> of the Belt system, NYC Parks commissioner Robert Moses cited the [...] "approximately 10,00,000 cars" [...] traveling the route on an annual basis, and the need for a highway link between Brooklyn and Long Island to create [...] "the ultimate cirumferential boulevard." ...|$|R
40|$|The Maynardville Limestone in Oak Ridge, Tennessee {{underlies}} the southern portion of Bear Creek Valley (BCV), {{and is considered}} to be the primary pathway for groundwater leaving the Y- 12 Plant boundaries. Sixty-seven percent of all wells drilled into the Maynardville Limestone have intersected at least one cavity, suggesting karst features may be encountered throughout the shallow (< 200 ft) portions of the Limestone. Because waste facilities at the Y- 12 Plant are located adjacent to the Maynardville Limestone, contaminants could enter the karst aquifer and be transported in the <b>conduit</b> system. As <b>part</b> of an overall hydrologic characterization effort of this karst aquifer, 41 wells in the Maynardville Limestone were instrumented with pressure transducers to monitor water level changes (hydrographs) associated with rain events. Wells at depths between approximately 20 and 750 ft were monitored over the course of at least two storms in order that variations with depth could be identified. The wells selected were not exclusively completed in cavities but were selected to include the broad range of hydrologic conditions present in the Maynardville Limestone. Cavities, fractures and diffuse flow zones were measured at a variety of depths. The water level data from the storms are used to identify areas of quickflow versus slower flowing water zones. The data are also used to estimate specific yields and continuum transmissitives in different portions of the aquifer...|$|R
40|$|Infrastructures {{constructed}} on unstable geologic formations {{are prone to}} subsidence. Data have been collected {{in the context of}} an upgrading project for a highway located beside a river dam {{constructed on}} gypsum-bearing formations. Surface water infiltrates upstream of the dam, circulates through the gravel deposits and into the weathered bedrock around and beneath the dam, and exfiltrates downstream into the river. As a result, an extended weathering zone within the bedrock and preferential flow paths within voids and <b>conduits</b> developed as <b>part</b> of a rapidly evolving karst system. Enhanced karstification in the soluble units of the gypsum-bearing formations resulted in subsidence of the dam and the highway. Since 2006, changes in the groundwater flow regime have been investigated by different methods that allowed the evaluation of the long-term performance of the infrastructures. Geological (outcrops, lithostratigraphic information from boreholes), hydrometrical (extensive groundwater monitoring, dye tracer tests) and hydrogeophysical (Electrical Resistivity Tomography, ERT) data were integrated into high-resolution 3 -D hydrogeological and 2 -D karst evolution models. The applied methods are validated and the sensitivity of relevant parameters governing the processes determined.

40|$|The {{emigration}} of the Scots {{from the}} 18 th to the 20 th century {{has produced a}} diaspora. The thesis outlines how many diasporas {{are involved in the}} nationalist projects of their homeland. However, over the chronology of this study and beyond, whilst there were active movements to amend or end the Union of 1707, it has been found that the Scots were not. The thesis then proposes some explanations for this. Chapters one and two introduce methods, research material and context; they describe the Union, the emigrations and diasporas. The study uses for comparison purposes the Irish and Norwegian diasporas. Lines of enquiry such as nationalism, the use of soft power and gatekeeping behaviour are presented, with a discussion of Scottish nationalism. The study examines the approach to involving the diaspora of five groups; both SHRAs, the International Scots Home Rule League, the National Convention and the NPS/SNP. The response of Scottish MPs in the diaspora in England to the many attempts to legislate for home rule is also examined. The approach to the diaspora was found to be badly executed and targeted. Few visits were made, and only to the US and Canada. Communication was unfocussed and spasmodic. The Scottish associational clubs were frequently used as a <b>conduit.</b> A small <b>part</b> of the whole diaspora, these acted as gatekeepers, selectively mobilising for themselves as an elite which had no need of nationalism as they could succeed without it. Comparing the Irish, whose diaspora successfully supported its nationalist causes at home, is instructive. The study concludes that the spasmodic and amateurish nature of contact, the nature of the Associations and that of the diaspora itself were the main culprits in this case of a diaspora indifferent to the fate of nationalism in its home land...|$|R
