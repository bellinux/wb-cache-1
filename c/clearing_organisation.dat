40|$|M. Comm. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether a strategic control tool, such as the Balanced Scorecard, could be used within a leading international forwarding and <b>clearing</b> <b>organisation</b> operating in the South African and international logistics markets. The name of the organisation has been concealed, for confidentiality purposes, and therefore in this study the organisation is referred to as SA Logistics. A literature review was conducted where firstly the elements of strategic control were examined. This was followed by a review of certain strategic control tools such as benchmarking and Economic Value Added models. Then the literature regarding the Balanced Scoreacard was analysed in detail. The research was conducted in two phases. In the first phase a self-administered questionnaire was sent out to a group of respondents from middle management, within SA Logistics. The questionnaire required respondents to rank on a semantic differential scale their preferences from a proposed set of key performance indicators. These Key performance indicators could potentially be used to exercise strategic control within SA Logistics. The proposed measures obtained from phase one was then verified with a group of executive members of SA Logistics during phase two of the study. Phase two was conducted by means of personal interviews with selected executive members. This verification process helped to determine the business sense of these proposed key performance indicators and allowed executive members to propose changes to these key performance indicators. The study found that the Balanced Scorecard could be used as a strategic control tool within a clearing and forwarding logistics organisation. The study established that all four of the perspectives of finance, customer, internal and learning/growth measures of the Balanced Scorecard can be tied into key business areas and related measures within SA Logistics. However, in order for this Balanced Scorecard to be widely accepted throughout the organisation, a more centralised approach is required. This study also allowed for a proposed Balanced Scorecard to be compiled for SA Logistics...|$|E

PagalmuRenesanse (Courtyard Renascence) and LabasVietasTalka (Nice Place Clean-up) were launched {{within the framework of}} Riga - European Capital of Culture 2014. In turn, Free Rigawas jointly launched by the artists and the entrepreneurs. The projects resultedin the revitalisation of the disused or low-quality urban spaces via the low-budget interventions. Instead of municipal agencies, these projects were initiated by the non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the urban revival activists. Free Riga is still running. Therefore, the main research methods employed were the semi-structured interviews, the participant observations and the field observations. The projects differed from each other in terms of organisation, influence on the urban environment and resident engagement. PagalmuRenesanse and LabasVietasTalka had the <b>clear</b> <b>organisation</b> structures and the action plans, whereas Free Riga began its activity with any structure or plan. Overall, the projects succeeded in changing the local built environment. The resident engagement was evaluated according to the contemporary adaptation of Arnstein's (1969) classical work.

40|$|This study {{sets out}} to {{discover}} how behaviour in school can be improved, in particular, for pupils with autistic spectrum condition at playtimes. It was prompted by the recognition {{that there had been}} little scholarly attention paid to playground behaviour for some years. The lack of written evidence on the subject was noted by Blatchford and other researchers in 1989; and 16 years later in 2005 Pellegrini made a similar observation. In the Primary National Strategy for playtimes and lunchtimes, DfES (2005 a) it was suggested that without <b>clear</b> <b>organisation</b> structures and caring supervision, playgrounds can become unruly places where symptoms of unease can aggravate and grow. These concerns were also recognised in the school where this study took place and was a catalyst for the research. Through an action research approach of planning, implementing and then reviewing the cycles of research, some conclusions have been reached. The school where the study was conducted has since closed. It was a mixed community special school in South Yorkshire. The study was conducted by a class teacher at the school and concludes with a discussion of a topology of behaviours which could affect conduct on the playground for children with autistic spectrum condition...|$|R

First, however, the purpose of the book: it sets out to challenge assumptions by some biblical scholars concerning economics in the Hebrew Bible. Land and its usage, the functions of debt and credit, and the nature of crisis constitute the main topics of Guillaume’s text. In each case, he feels he is making a provocative proposal: that the primary concern with land was usufruct and labour, rather than any notion of private property in land; that debt kept farmers on the land (due to labour shortage) rather than remove them from it; that there was no economic crisis in the early Second Temple period. Only on the first point are there more gems than pieces of junk. The opening discussion of land tenure is generally good, occasionally great. Guillaume debunks the idea that there was widespread private property in Second Temple Yehud. Rather loosely defining private property in the modern sense (why not say capitalist, since that is crucial?) as th...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Amazon Fan {{is one of}} {{the largest}} river-fed {{submarine}} fan systems in the world. It is located in the Western Equatorial Atlantic and extends 1100 km northward from the Amazon canyon head located at the shelf break off northern Brazil. Numerous previous investigations on the Amazon Fan mostly focused on the upper and middle parts of the fan. Two recent cruises have provided a new dataset based on bathymetric, acoustic imagery and 3. 5 kHz sub-bottom profiler data. It is the first detailed exploration of the youngest Amazon channel-mouth lobe complex that remained the “missing piece” of one of the best studied modern deep-sea fans. The stratigraphic framework of the surveyed channel-mouth lobe complex of the Amazon Fan consists of eight channel-levee systems and their associated channel-mouth lobe systems (from Brown to Amazon). These depositional systems record a complex depositional history in a short time period between the Last Glacial Maximum (not, vert, similar 20, 000 cal yr BP) and the rise in sea-level until 10, 100 cal yr BP, when sediment supply to the fan ceased. The main body of the lobes is characterised by a general low to average backscatter facies (from white to light grey) scattered with higher backscatter fingers (dark grey). Two types of lobes are distinguished based on the planform shape of their backscatter facies: (1) elongated and narrow lobes with branching patterns like the veins of a leaf and (2) radial lobes with crescent-shaped features opened in the downstream direction, that do not have a <b>clear</b> <b>organisation</b> within the lobe. The eight channel-levee systems and associated lobes were built in a time span of not, vert, similar 10 ka and with an average time between successive avulsions of 1250 years. The life span of lobes in the Amazon system is around 600 years which is very short compared to the life span of the fan as a whole. The observed wide range in channel lengths and lobe sizes suggests that each system had a variable time duration and/or sediment supply rate. The variability of the channel lengths could be controlled by internal and/or external forcings linked to processes occurring at different stages in the system in the Amazon drainage basin, on the Amazon shelf, at the canyon head or at the channels bifurcation point. Numerous channel-levee systems and lobes are concentrated in a relatively narrow area. Locally, the pre-existing morphology of the distal depositional area influences the shape and the location of lobes, providing an argument for strong topographical control where local gradient and degree of topographic confinement are key control parameters...|$|R

2500|$|The {{conflict}} {{has been a}} controversial area of study by historians, even characterised as among [...] Australia's history wars. [...] Keith Windschuttle in his 2002 work, The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One: Van Diemen's Land 1803–1847, questioned the historical evidence used to identify the number of Aboriginal people killed {{and the extent of}} conflict. [...] He stated his belief that it had been exaggerated and he challenged what is labelled the [...] "Black armband view of history" [...] of Tasmanian colonisation. Windschuttle argued that there were only 2000 Aboriginal people in Tasmania at the moment of colonisation, that they had an internally dysfunctional society with no <b>clear</b> tribal <b>organisation</b> or connection to the land and were politically incapable of conducting a guerrilla war with the settlers. He argued they were more like [...] "black bushrangers" [...] who attacked settlers' huts for plunder and were led by [...] "educated black terrorists" [...] disaffected from white society. He concluded that two colonists had been killed for every Aboriginal person and there was only one massacre of Aboriginal people. He also claimed that the Aboriginal Tasmanians, by prostituting their women to sealers and stock-keepers, by catching European diseases, and through intertribal warfare, were responsible for their own demise. His argument in turn has been challenged by a number of authors, including S.G. Foster in Quadrant, Lyndall Ryan and Nicholas Clements.|$|R
