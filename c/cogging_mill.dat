50|$|No1 Mill was a 30 in {{reversing}} <b>cogging</b> <b>mill</b> {{driven by}} a several hundred horsepower electric motor through a Krupp gearbox. The cogging stand reduced the 12 in section ingot to either slab or bar of 9 in section. All hot material was moved at ground level on live roller paths. The second and third stands reduced material to either square or round bar of 4 in section, or plate of 2 in section.|$|E
50|$|When {{building}} a new plant such as Brinsworth {{it was necessary to}} ensure {{that there would be a}} good supply of raw material. The ingots produced were rolled to blooms and then slabs in the Templeborough <b>Cogging</b> <b>Mill.</b> The slabs were then delivered to Brinsworth by train on one of the six rail tracks laid. The majority of these tracks have been lifted although there is still evidence on the plant of the old railway system.|$|E
50|$|The {{steel making}} plant was changed in 1897 when the Bessemer {{converters}} {{were replaced by}} three open hearth furnaces and the processing plant increased {{with the addition of}} <b>cogging</b> <b>mills,</b> rail mills and specialist plant for the manufacture of steel springs and railway axles. In 1914, following the outbreak of the First World War many iron and steel companies began producing munitions. In this case the work was added to the normal production, which included many component orders for the military. The Ickles site was proving too small to handle the production, and with steel in such demand, the company extended their works towards the Sheffield boundary, to occupy a site between the main Sheffield to Rotherham road and the Great Central Railway line. The new Melting Shop and Rolling Mills were built over the site of the old Roman fort at Templeborough. The Templeborough Melting Shop, when opened, was the largest melting shop of its type in Europe and contained 14 open hearth furnaces where steel scrap was melted down.|$|R
50|$|The 10 ft {{diameter}} wooden Brake Wheel is of clasp arm construction, {{converted from}} compass arm. It has 72 cogs and {{is carried on}} a cast iron windshaft which formerly carried four double Patent sails. The brake wheel drove a wooden Wallower carried on a 31 ft long wooden Upright Shaft. The 9 ft diameter wooden Great Spur Wheel is of compass arm construction with 84 <b>cogs.</b> The <b>mill</b> latterly drove three pairs of millstones.|$|R
50|$|Blooming, <b>cogging</b> and {{slabbing}} <b>mills,</b> {{being the}} preparatory mills to rolling finished rails, shapes or plates, respectively. If reversing, {{they are from}} 34 to 48 inches in diameter, and if three-high, from 28 to 42 inches in diameter.|$|R
2500|$|The Brake Wheel {{has been}} {{converted}} from Compass arm construction to clasp arm construction, it is [...] diameter with 63 <b>cogs.</b> The <b>mill</b> was originally built with {{a single pair of}} millstones in the breast, but now has two pairs. The Upright Shaft is cast iron, and carries three wheels. There is a [...] cast iron mortice wheel with 66 cogs drives a flour dresser. The Wallower is an iron mortice gear with 24 cogs, and the Spur Wheel is also an iron mortice gear, with 63 cogs. The stone nuts have 20 cogs each.|$|R
50|$|The Ouddeelsmolen is {{what the}} Dutch {{describe}} as a Grondzeiler. It is a one storey smock mill on a single storey base. There is no stage, the sails reaching almost to ground level. The mill is winded by tailpole and winch. The smock and cap are thatched. The sails are Common sails. They have a span of 16.42 m. The sails are carried on a cast iron windshaft, which was cast by J M de Muinck Keizer, Martenshoek. Groningen in 1898. The windshaft carries the brake wheel which has 44 <b>cogs.</b> The <b>mill</b> formerly drove an Archimedes' screw.|$|R
40|$|The {{essence of}} the applied {{technology}} of rolling by slitting-process in four legs of reinforcing steel No 10 of j strength class AtSOOC, A 500 C and AtSOO with longitudinal separation of <b>cogged</b> ingot in <b>mill</b> flow “ 320 ” RUP “BMZ” is expounded.

50|$|The wooden {{brake wheel}} is of clasp arm construction. It has 77 cogs of 4 in pitch, driving a wooden wallower with 21 cogs. The {{cast-iron}} spur wheel is 3 ft diameter with 66 cogs. It drives the {{two pairs of}} millstones underdrift via two 22 in diameter stone nuts with 32 <b>cogs</b> each. The <b>mill</b> was assisted in its later years by a portable steam engine, which had been built by Wedlake & Dendy Ltd., Engineers of Hornchurch and carried their works number 74.|$|R
5000|$|Goemon's Great Adventure {{sold over}} 160,000 copies {{worldwide}} and received favorable reviews, earning an 8 out of 10 at IGN, an A at 1UP.com, a 3.5 out of 5 at GamePro, and a metascore of 80% at GameRankings. Critics enjoyed the [...] "simple, yet enjoyable platform gameplay", specifically citing Castlevania overtones and fresh, varied level design as strongpoints. The 2.5D system received much fanfare; GamePro {{stated that it}} made the game [...] "more exciting than any old 2D scrollers." [...] Nintendo noted that the game looks [...] "more realistic than any 16-bit platformer, but...plays just like one." [...] The presence of a cooperative mode for two players was considered a huge improvement over the game's predecessor, and brought back memories of [...] "classic Nintendo and Konami sidescrollers." [...] David Canter of The San Diego Union-Tribune felt the [...] "ability to control four diverse characters gives the game a nice touch of variety." [...] The camera issues found in Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon were solved by the switch to the sidescrolling genre. Peer Schneider of IGN celebrated the game's non-linear puzzle elements and quests, which made the game require {{more than a day}} to complete. GamePro noted that these quests still took place in completed stages, lending little added appeal. While Nintendo Power applauded the precise play control, GamePro argued {{that it could have been}} slackened somewhat. Canter countered, [...] "control is responsive. A good thing, too, as Goemon's Great Adventure quickly becomes challenging... The only problem with control occurs when playing as the mermaid...maneuvering a beached whale might be easier." [...] Great Adventures graphics impressed critics—Schneider wrote that they seemed [...] "right out of a Kurosawa movie, complete with both Buddhist and Shinto architecture, temples, shrines, tombstones, <b>cogs,</b> <b>mills,</b> giant frogs, statues and more," [...] while Nintendo lauded the special effects, including [...] "artfully composed cinema sequences...backdrops of glimmering water...and...translucent spirits." [...] Canter agreed that while they [...] "don't set a new standard, but there are some nice visual touches." [...] GamePro and IGN agreed that enemy design was generally less impressive, excepting the boss characters and Impact robots. David Canter disagreed, citing [...] "castle bosses, such as the screen-filling skeleton" [...] as [...] "especially eye-pleasing".|$|R
50|$|Windmill Hill Mill is a {{post mill}} on a two-storey roundhouse. She has four patent sails {{carried on a}} {{cast-iron}} windshaft and was winded by a tailpole. Winding is now computer-controlled, with an automatic turning device installed that receives information about the wind direction from sensors mounted on the mill. The wooden brake-wheel is of clasp-arm construction, with oak arms and an elm rim. It has 104 cogs and drives a stone nut with twelve cogs. The tail wheel is of cast iron, with 130 <b>cogs.</b> The <b>mill</b> drove two pairs of millstones, arranged head and tail. The headstones are Peak stones and the tailstones are French Burrs. The body of the mill is 21 ft long and 12 ft wide, the largest surviving post mill by floor plan in the United Kingdom. It is 50 ft high to the roof, the second tallest post mill in England. The roundhouse is 22 ft in diameter and has a single-storey lean-to extension of part of its circumference. When originally built, the mill {{may have had a}} single-storey roundhouse needing to be raised by a storey in the 1870s when Hammond's Sweep Governor was fitted.|$|R
50|$|Outwood Smock Mill, {{also known}} as High Mill, was a tall smock mill of five storeys, with a stage at first-floor level. It was built on a low brick base less than 2 ft high. The cant posts were 48 ft long, and the mill stood 62 ft high {{to the top of}} the cap. This made it the tallest smock ever built, {{although}} not the tallest smock mill (Union Mill, Cranbrook takes that honour). Unusually, the ground floor was above ground level, at a height of about 3 ft. The smock was 26 ft across the flats at the base, and 13 ft at the curb. The cap was 13 ft by 11 ft in plan, and winded by a five bladed fantail. The four sails were Spring Patents, spanning 80 ft, carried in a cast iron Windshaft. The Brake Wheel was 9 ft diameter, driving a 4 ft diameter cast-iron Wallower. This had replaced an earlier Wallower of 4 ft diameter which bore a date of 1864, indicating that the mill had three wallowers in a working life of 117 years. The wooden Upright shaft was sixteen-sided, 20 in across the flats, with a dog clutch allowing the windmill to be disconnected when the mill was being driven by the portable engine. The wooden Great Spur Wheel was 8 ft diameter, with 120 <b>cogs.</b> The <b>mill</b> drove four pairs of overdrift millstones, one pair bearing a date of 1859.|$|R
50|$|Restoration of Framsden Windmill {{commenced}} in June 1966. A stock {{had broken}} {{and half a}} sail had fallen shortly before, so the remaining half sail and its partner were removed, along with the stock. The roof was made watertight and the left side bottom side rail was strengthened. This work {{was carried out by}} Frank Farrow, Stanley Freese, Christopher Hullcoop, Vincent Pargeter and Peter Stenning. In 1967, the main post was strengthened with iron bars and steel hoops as it was badly split. The mill was at that time head-sick, and leant to the right. This was attended to, and the mill put back on an even keel. The right hand side girt was found to have broken at the joint with the crown tree. It was reinforced with a heavy angle iron bolted on top. In 1968, the two remaining sails were lowered for repair and the stock was reinforced by fitting a pair of clamps. In 1969, the Brake Wheel was repaired, with two new elm segments being made and fitted. The repaired sails were refitted in March and July. The striking gear was repaired, with the cross from Victoria Mill, Eye replacing that broken when the sail fell. On 7 February 1970, the mill turned by wind again. A lightning conductor was fitted and the Brake Wheel was re-cogged with hornbeam. The Brake Wheel originally had 61 cogs, and was refitted with 78 <b>cogs</b> when the <b>mill</b> was modernised. In 1971, work was done to get the left-hand pair of millstones into working order and repair the fantail carriage. In May 1972, the mill ground wheat {{for the first time in}} preservation. The rear steps were repaired and the fantail carriage fitted in 1973.|$|R
