50|$|The second {{protagonist of}} the series, Rikuo is Kazahayas current co-worker and roommate, {{as well as}} the one who found Kazahaya lying nearly dead in the snow. Similarly to Kazahaya, his mysterious past is also {{centered}} on a woman, this one named Tsukiko. It appears that they lived together at some point, though at present the exact nature of their relationship remains unknown. Rikuo often comes across as being cold and insensitive, sometimes even sarcastic, and takes great pleasure in teasing Kazahaya. However, in spite of his nature, he is always the one who comes to Kazahayas rescue when certain jobs go wrong. He has powers similar to telekinesis, as he can break things like <b>cups,</b> <b>locks</b> and branches.|$|R

40|$|Hip hemiarthroplasty (HA) is a {{conservative}} treatment for hip diseases (e. g. osteoporosis, femoral head necrosis) and injuries (e. g. femoral neck fractures) compared to total hip replacement (THR). HA is commonly used in elder patients who have low activity requirements and can be delivered with reduced blood loss, shorter operation time, and hospital stay. HA has been developed to unipolar and bipolar prostheses, {{and the range of}} motion has been improved with new designs of the bipolar prostheses. However, satisfaction of HA is not always positive due to the erosion, degradation of the acetabular cartilage, and the dislocation of femoral head which have reported in clinical studies. Hence, the mechanical factors which affect the tribological properties of articular cartilage in HA have been investigated experimentally in an in- vitro simulation of HA. In a simple geometry HA model, the articular cartilage coefficient of friction, deformation, and wear have been examined in a cartilage pin on metal plate model. The loading time, contact stress levels, contact areas, stroke lengths and sliding velocities were set as the input variables, and it was found that: 1) coefficient of friction was time- and load- dependent in short-term (1 hour) testing; 2) wear was load- dependent in long-term (24 hours) testing; 3) contact area only affected the coefficient of friction when both fluid and solid phase of cartilage supported the load due to the different aspect ratio; 4) the stroke length and sliding velocity affected the coefficient of friction only under low level of contact stress (: 52 MPa), but affected the cartilage wear under all levels of contact stresses. In an entire simulation of HA, the acetabular cartilage coefficient of friction, surface roughness, wear, and deformation have been studied with metal or ceramic heads articulating against acetabular cartilage in a pendulum friction simulator. The clearance between the head and acetabulum, loading types, and prosthesis design were set as the input variables, and it was demonstrated that: 1) a trend of decrease of the coefficient of friction was shown with increasing clearances under both constant and dynamic loading; 2) severe cartilage severe damage was observed when radial clearance was > 1. 8 mm under constant loading; 3) ceramic heads decreased the cartilage wear, and change of surface roughness compared to metal heads; 4) a novel bipolar design with a thin metal cup and metal head failed to reduce the coefficient of friction due to the <b>cup</b> <b>locking</b> in the acetabulum. The methodologies and findings in this research can currently adopted for related future studies, additionally the anatomic pendulum friction natural joint simulation can be used for the pre-clinical studies in less invasive procedures in the future.

40|$|Backside wear due to {{micromotion}} {{and poor}} conformity between the liner and its titanium alloy shell {{may contribute to}} the high rates of retroacetabular osteolysis and consequent aseptic loosening. The purpose of our study was to understand the wear process on the backside of polyethylene liners from two acetabular <b>cup</b> systems, whose <b>locking</b> mechanism is based on a press-fit cone in combination with a rough titanium conical inner surface on the fixation area. A direct comparison between in vitro wear simulator tests (equivalent to 3 years of use) and retrieved liners (average 13. 1 months in situ) was done in order to evaluate the backside wear characteristics and behavior of these systems. Similar wear scores between in vitro tested and retrieved liners were observed. The results showed that this locking mechanism did not significantly produce wear marks at the backside of the polyethylene liners due to micromotion. In all the analyzed liners, the most common wear modes observed were small scratches at the cranial fixation zone directly below the rough titanium inner surface of the shell. It was concluded that most of the wear marks were produced during the insertion and removal of the liner, rather than during its time in situ...|$|R
50|$|A new Wile Cup {{champion}} {{would be}} crowned in Croqsoc's second season, as Gelinas had graduated {{and would not}} be able to defend his title (documents show that Gelinas actually graduated in December 2003, and in effect, his student status should have ended. Although enrolled in student housing through the spring, some dispute his eligibility in winning the Wile Cup. Opposition to his status has dissipated over time). President Wile had also graduated, allowing Fischer to step up from Vice-President and lead the club. The new season may have brought in a crop of hopefuls to mix in with the sophomore players, but it opened identically as the previous campaign, with Van Kleeck again taking the Autumn Classic tournament. After he was victorious at November Reign II, it looked like the Wile <b>Cup</b> was a <b>lock</b> for Van Kleeck. However, by the time the Masters of the University came around, it was a three-horse race to the finish. Jacob E. Cruise led in the points standings with 23, followed by Erica Drake (22) and Van Kleeck (21). Incredibly, first-round collapses by Drake and Van Kleeck kept them out of vying for the Cup in the final, automatically awarding Cruise the victory even before the final round. By finishing in 4th, Cruise also became the first player to win the Wile Cup without having won a single tournament.|$|R
40|$|AIM: The {{evolution}} of cup designs have indeed contributed to better long term results in hip arthroplasty. This article aims {{to address the}} {{evolution of}} the modern day cups, pros and cons,literature review with regards to outcome and survivorship of monoblock and modular cementless cups in primary total hip arthroplasty. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search on Pubmed,Medline and Cochrane database and enlisted Randomised Controlled trials (Level 1 /II evidence) /Retrospective comparative study, (level III evidence) and case series (Level IV evidence) of Modular and Monoblock cups over the past 15 years from Jan 1998 to May 2013. Details with reference to cup revision, aseptic loosening, osteolysis, migration, liner wear and survivorship were enlisted. Results: Modular acetabular cups have shown excellent long term results in majority of the studies. Issues of liner breakage and liner dissociation have largely been resolved by the evolution of third generation <b>cups</b> with improved <b>locking</b> mechanism. Concerns of aseptic loosening and retroacetabular osteolysis prevail especially in the second decade. Monoblock cups have shown excellent results in most of the studies largely in the midterm followup. Conclusion: Both Modular and monoblock cups have shown consistent good results. Literature review has shown a paucity of Level 1 studies in this regard and more Randomised controlled trials are to be called for. As of this day {{there is no evidence to}} demonstrate a clear advantage of use of one over the other...|$|R
50|$|Kippax Welfare rugby {{league has}} been a part of Kippax village for many years. The first ever team was formed in 1948 by Jack Kielty based at the 'Old Tree inn'.In 1958 Kippax went on to win the Yorkshire <b>Cup</b> beating Castleford <b>Lock</b> Lane. By the late 1960s through to the 70s, Kippax were now playing from 'the White Swan'. Kippax were now at their best, famous for playing a no {{nonsense}} style of rugby and were amongst the elite of amateur rugby clubs. Kipaax has played in the Challenge Cup on numerous occasions, but 1973/74 was the first time Kippax played in the proper first round of the Challenge Cup coming up against Leigh Centurions which Kippax fell just short of winning. In the early 1980s, Kippax moved to the Longdike Lane facilities. This also saw the introduction of youth and junior teams, producing some of super league's finest players such as Matt Crowther, Paul Darley, Gavin Swinson and as well as two England and Great Britain internationals, Danny Orr and Andy Lynch. During the early 2000s, Kippax Welfare were now playing in the Pennine Leagues under ex Hunslet star Andrew Atha. Ex pros in Gateshead Thunder legend Andy Walker and Featherstone Rovers duo Kieran Hickman and Dean Ripley helped the aging team become Division Three Champions in 2002/03, Division Two Champions in 2004/05 and Division One Champions in 2008/09 as well as Castleford Cup Champions the same year meaning this was a double winning season, Atha was eventually replaced by a coaching team of David Jessey and Kippax Welfare and ex Super League star Gavin Swinson. While the Kippax 'A' (second) team won Pennine Division Six (Undefeated) coached by legend Neil Collins.|$|R
