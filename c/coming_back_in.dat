5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} more {{concerning}} in pregnancy {{due to the}} increased risk of kidney infections. During pregnancy, high progesterone levels elevate the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder, {{which leads to a}} greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys. While pregnant women do not have an increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, if bacteriuria is present they do have a 25–40% risk of a kidney infection. Thus if urine testing shows signs of an infection—even in the absence of symptoms—treatment is recommended. Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy. A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state of high blood pressure and kidney dysfunction during pregnancy that can lead to seizures). Some women have UTIs that keep <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> pregnancy and currently there is not enough research on how to best treat these infections.|$|E

After {{leaving the}} Presidential office, Sarkozy vowed {{to retire from}} public life before <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> September 2014, being subsequently reelected as UMP leader (renamed The Republicans in 2015). On 2 July 2014, Sarkozy was charged with corruption by French prosecutors. In 2016, he ran in the Republican presidential primary, and was eliminated {{in the first round}} of voting.|$|E

Concertus Manila, a Philippine based company, provides the possibility of giving metro Manila {{a chance to see}} high-end productions. In 2016, they did a production of Les Miserables, in 2014 they did , and Wicked which is <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> 2017.

25|$|Players on {{the return}} team will once again be allowed to block {{oncoming}} tacklers from the sides. This was the rule until 2006, when the CFL outlawed blocks {{on the back of}} the side, leading to the temporary demise of the kick return touchdown. In 2006, there were only three touchdowns from kick returns, compared to eighteen in 2005. In addition to fewer touchdowns being scored, shorter kick returns lead to offences having to cover a larger portion of the field to score a touchdown, leading to more field goals and fewer touchdowns. With the long kick returns <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> 2007, it was expected that games would be higher scoring and more exciting.|$|E
25|$|The Americans then {{struggled}} {{to make the playoffs}} only making it in 1936. Under the ownership of Red Dutton, the Americans made the playoffs in 1938 with a 19–18–11 record. Facing the Rangers for the second and final time, the Americans defeated the Rangers in three games with the help of veterans Ching Johnson and Hap Day. Once the United States joined World War II, both teams started to fade in terms of players; most American-born players went to fight in the war. The Americans folded in 1942 with the hope of <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> 1946 after the war ended. However, the League reneged the promises made to the Amerks and cancelled the franchise. Owner Red Dutton was so furious at Madison Square Garden for not reinstating his team that he swore the Rangers would never win another Stanley Cup during his lifetime. This became true as the Rangers did not win the Stanley Cup again until 1994; Dutton died in 1987.|$|E
25|$|During {{the climb}} of the Col de Marie-Blanque, Dessel and Mercado again {{proved to be}} the strongest with Dessel coming through first as he had done on the two earlier climbs already: the polka dot jersey was his. Landaluze came closest to coming back as he was about 50 meters behind {{at some point during the}} descent, but the two leaders worked {{together}} not to let that happen. However, about 15 kilometres before the finish line, Mercado was hoping to make a deal with Dessel: since Dessel was going to be winning the yellow and polka dot jersey, he was hoping to be getting the stage win from Dessel in return for helping him. However Dessel wanted it all, so Mercado stopped helping and Dessel had to maintain the lead by himself to prevent Landaluze from <b>coming</b> <b>back.</b> <b>In</b> the end, Mercado sprinted past Dessel about 300 metres from the finish and won the stage. Landaluze finished third about a minute behind. Moreni, Rinero, Isasi and Vasseur also managed to stay in front of the pelont, the others were caught.|$|E

500|$|Songs {{from this}} album were {{performed}} regularly by the Mk. I line-up.

II formation performed [...] "Kentucky Woman" [...] in their first shows, but dropped it from the set list together with the few other songs from the first three albums, in favour of new material.

500|$|Dylan's {{relationship}} with Rotolo also provided an important emotional dynamic {{in the composition}} of the Freewheelin album. After six months of living with Dylan, Rotolo agreed to her mother's proposal that she travel to Italy to study art. Dylan missed her and wrote long letters to her conveying his hope that she would return soon to New York. She postponed her return several times, finally <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> January 1963. Critics have connected the intense love songs expressing longing and loss on Freewheelin to Dylan's fraught {{relationship with}} Rotolo. In her autobiography, Rotolo explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as [...] "chicks", and she resented being regarded as [...] "a possession of Bob, who was the center of attention".|$|E

As she felt the song was different for the band, Lee knew that they didn't want to [...] "go the classic, sort of fantastic, epic [...]" [...] Lee asked her sister Carrie to help her around {{the concept of the}} video. Her sister said that they should film the video for the song in New York and Lee agreed with her idea, [...] "She just started saying things that were right on. She was like, 'This should be in New York. You guys need to do something different, this song feels different.' And she started talking about running across the Brooklyn Bridge, and it being where I live, and I was like, 'Oh my God, this is great.'" [...] However, the final shot of the video filmed at Coney Island was Lee's own idea. The shot represented the band <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the world and [...] "heading into the unknown, coming into a new world".|$|E

500|$|Overmars {{made his}} debut for Barcelona against Arsenal in the Amsterdam Tournament in August 2000. He lasted 45 minutes and was {{substituted}} after sustaining an ankle injury.

He scored his first goal for the club at home to Racing de Santander on 23 September 2000; it involved him dribbling the ball around the goalkeeper. Barcelona made an indifferent start to the 2000–01 season and by February 2001, journalist Sid Lowe commented it looked improbable that Lorenzo Serra Ferrer would remain as manager of the club. Wenger was touted as his replacement after reportedly meeting with Gaspart. Overmars believed his former manager {{was going to leave}} Arsenal and revealed that, [...] "Barcelona have asked for lots of information about Wenger. I think something could happen soon." [...] In La Liga, Overmars scored the team's seventh goal in their 7–0 win against Athletic Bilbao in March 2001; his performance was rated four stars out of five by El Mundo Deportivo.|$|E
