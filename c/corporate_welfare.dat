2500|$|Writing for Reason {{magazine}} in February 2011, Damon Root expressed {{the opinion that}} Barbour supports farm subsidies, <b>corporate</b> <b>welfare,</b> and eminent domain. When he took office, the state of Mississippi had run a $709million budget deficit for the 2004 fiscal year. With bipartisan support, and without raising taxes, Barbour implemented a plan called [...] to cut the budget deficit in half. He accomplished this largely by reducing spending on social services, most notably Medicaid; the 2005 budget drastically reduced coverage for 65,000 individuals classified as Poverty-Level Aged and Disabled (PLAD), most of whom qualified for the federal Medicare program, and also significantly limited prescription drug coverage. However, the same budget increased the percentage of Medicaid prescriptions that are for generic drugs. In 2005, the state was budgeted to spend a total of $130million less on Medicaid {{than in the previous}} year. This trend continued in the state budget for the 2006 fiscal year. After a long special session, the legislature approved a budget that featured more social service cuts but also increased educational spending. With tax revenues higher than expected during the 2006 fiscal year, {{due in large part to}} increased sales tax revenues in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the state achieved its first balanced budget in years. In the 2008 fiscal year budget, for the first time since its enactment in 1997, the state fully funded the Mississippi Adequate Education Program.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{relationships}} between observed processes of post-acquisition activities within four cross-border horizontal acquisitions {{that occurred in the}} telecommunications equipment manufacturing sector between 1988 and 1992. We discuss the desirability of such acquisitions from a <b>corporate</b> and social <b>welfare</b> standpoint. We report a detailed survey of the context, post-acquisition activities and outcomes of the four acquisitions. The acquisition context includes industry characteristics, target characteristics, target strengths and acquisition motives. Post-acquisition activities include several dimensions of business restructuring, resource redeployment and creation of integration mechanisms. Acquisition outcomes include impact on business capabilities, financial performance and judgments of overall success. We conclude that the results provide stronger support for strategic reconfiguration and productive efficiency explanations for horizontal acquisitions than they do for market power, target mismanagement or resource appropriation explanations. 1...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{developed}} a simple two-period {{general equilibrium model}} to analyze the macroeconomic impact of tax policies in Pakistan. They analyze two scenarios. In scenario 1, the investment tax credit rate is increased from 15 percent to 30 percent. The new fiscal regime increases investment but also significantly increases inflation. In scenario 2, the original investment tax credit rate is retained but the statutory corporate tax rate is reduced. Welfare improves more than under scenario 1. The authors conclude that in Pakistan, at least, changes in corporate tax rates are probably better instruments for promoting capital formation than are increased investment tax credits. In particular, cuts in <b>corporate</b> taxes improve <b>welfare</b> more than do increases in investment tax credits. Increasing the investment tax credit stimulates more capital formation than does decreasing corporate taxes, but the tax credits also have significant macroeconomic consequences.

This paper assesses {{the effects of the}} carbon tax using a model that addresses these interactions. The model is unique in integrating a detailed treatment of taxes and attention to nonrenewable resource supply dynamics within a disaggregated general equilibrium framework. We find that the GNP and welfare costs of the carbon tax are significantly lower than what would be predicted if tax interactions were disregarded. When the revenues are used to finance reductions in marginal taxes at the personal or <b>corporate</b> level, the <b>welfare</b> costs are 25 - 32 percent lower than when the revenues finance lump-sum reductions in taxes. Pre-existing distortions [...] specifically, the relatively light taxation of fossil-fuel-producing industries in comparison with other industries [...] imply that the gross efficiency costs of carbon taxes are about 15 percent lower than would be the case if fossil-fuel-producing industries were not initially tax-favored. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Macroeconomic {{analysis}} of tax reform in dynamic general equilibrium usually assumes that reforms hit the economy unexpectedly and last forever. Here, we explore how previous results change when we allow tax reforms to be pre-announced and of finite duration and these facts are anticipated by households and firms. Interestingly, {{we find that}} the welfare gain of the representative consumer changes only little when pre-announcment is taken into account. This result, however, hides the fact that (possibly large) welfare differentials before and after enactment of a policy change are balancing each other. It implies that the anticipation of tax reforms entails important intergenerational distribution effects. This is even the more true when the termination of a tax cut is anticipated. As a (non-generalizable) rule {{we find that the}} generation that becomes economically active when a temporary tax cut is terminated benefits most. These benefits are at the expense of older generations already active when a temporarily lower tax rates apply.
