40|$|Pulse intensities {{greater than}} 10 (17) Watt/cm(2) were reached at the FLASH soft X-ray laser in Hamburg, Germany, using an {{off-axis}} parabolic mirror to focus 15 fs pulses of 5 - 70 mu J energy at 13. 5 nm wavelength to a micron-sized spot. We describe {{the interaction of}} such pulses with niobium and vanadium targets and their deuterides. The beam produced craters in the solid targets, and we measured the kinetic energy of ions ejected from these craters. Ions with several keV kinetic energy were observed from craters approaching 5 mu m in depth when the sample was at best focus. We also observed the onset of saturation in both ion acceleration and ablation with pulse intensities exceeding 10 (16) W/cm(2), when the highest detected ion energies and the crater depths tend to saturate with increasing intensity. A general difficulty in working with micron and sub-micron focusing optics is finding the exact focus of the beam inside a vacuum chamber. Here we propose a direct method to measure the focal position to a resolution better than the Rayleigh length. The method {{is based on the}} correlation between the energies of ejected ions and the physical dimensions of the craters. We find that the focus position can be quickly determined from the ion time-of-flight (TOF) data as the target is scanned through the expected focal region. The method does not require external access to the sample or venting the vacuum <b>chamber.</b> <b>Profile</b> fitting employed to analyze the TOF data can extend resolution beyond the actual scanning step size.

40|$|Recently, {{logistics}} and haulage {{companies are}} considering using CNG for their existing compression ignition (C. I.) engines. In {{an effort to}} address this challenge, a parametric study on a medium duty C. I. engine (naturally aspirated, 4. 3 L, 4 -cylinder) operated using retrofitted Monogas concept is presented. Extensive simulation (GTPower software) and experimental works using an engine test bed had been carried out to characterize the Monogas engine. Generally, successful retrofitting demands modifications in combustion chamber profiles, compression ratio, fuelling, ignition timing, intake, and exhaust systems. The optimum re-entrance (RE) and toroidal radius (TR) ratio for retrofitting must be between 0. 16 and 0. 60, for a compression ratio (CR) of 11 : 1. From the various combustion <b>chamber</b> <b>profile</b> designs, the design with lower central projection and RE to TR ratio of 0. 16 was considered as the optimum combustion chamber geometry profile. Using this design, the 4. 3 L C. I. engine was successfully converted and tested at steady state engine conditions and selected set-points driving cycle. The findings from the simulation showed that the tested Monogas engine exhibited lower brake torque (BT) and brake power (BP) {{in the range of}} 13 % - 19 %. It also produced lower CO 2 (59 %), CO (85 %) and NOX (85 %) emissions, with the penalties of HC emissions and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC); increase of 85 % and 13 % respectively. Comparisons with experimental works using C. I. engine had concluded that the Monogas engine was operating with high BSFC with an improved volumetric efficiency () in the range of 40 % to 58 %. It also released lower CO (68 %) and HC (48 %) emissions, and high CO 2 emissions, indicating high combustion efficiency. However, NOX emissions were higher in both experimental settings, whereas HC emissions were observed to be higher during the driving cycle set-point tests. Therefore, the methodology developed offers a successful C. I. engine converted to Monogas engine system via retrofit technology and an opening for future development and characterization into comprehensive support for implementation of energy efficient and environmental friendly vehicles...|$|E

40|$|This report {{provides}} an Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) chronology for the construction, occupation and abandonment {{sequence of the}} Baile Sear Wheelhouse structure in North Uist. The structure was exposed following coastal erosion in 2005, and was excavated by SCAPE with community support in 2009 and 2010. The site was visited by David Sanderson in September 2010 to collect OSL samples. The sediments associated with the monument and its immediate environment were reviewed, and luminescence profiling was undertaken to evaluate the sequence, and to identify sampling positions for OSL dating. Luminescence profiling, using portable field equipment, was used to guide sampling and interpretation. Field gamma spectrometry was used to record the environmental dose rates in {{the positions of the}} OSL dating tube samples. Luminescence profiling was undertaken in 7 sections. Profiles 1 and 2 examined substrates below the wheelhouse structure, and an underlying burnt earth surface which represents an earlier structure. The dating questions associated with this material, relate to the age of the earlier structure and the construction of the wheelhouse. Profiles 3 and 4 examined the stratigraphy of sediments immediately outside the southern wheelhouse wall, which record a collapse of the southern wall, and subsequent repacking. The dating questions here relate to the timing of the collapse and repacking events relative to wheelhouse construction and the occupation evidence within the southern <b>chamber.</b> <b>Profile</b> 5 examined the infill of the southern interior area, including materials associated with part of the occupation period and deliberate abandonment of this part of the wheelhouse. The chronology of this abandonment relative to the wall collapse is of interest. Profiles 6 and 7 examined the infill of the central and northern interior areas, including occupation evidence, a hearth sequence, and aeolian sands associated with the final abandonment. In total 58 profiling samples and 11 tube samples with associated field dosimetry were collected, from these 7 profiles, which together represent all of the key phases of activity associated with the construction, use and abandonment of the Baile Sear wheelhouse. The wheelhouse itself is located within a broader sequence of mounds in the vicinity, and which may, together with the other monuments in the surrounding landscape have also contributed to the archaeological materials in proximity to the site. OSL analyses of the profiling samples, both in the field, and in the laboratory have been reported elsewhere. This report concerns the OSL dating measurements conducted using the Single Aliquot Regenerative (SAR) method from 10 of the OSL dating samples, and there use to determine a chronology for the site. Sample preparation and analysis was undertaken at the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC). OSL SAR dating utilises extracted quartz from the samples to determine the radiation dose experienced by the sediments since their last zeroing event, assumed to be by exposure to light prior to final deposition. This is combined with dose rate analysis based on field and laboratory measurements of environmental radioactivity. The age is determined as the ratio of dose divided by dose rate. In this work, dose rates for the bulk sediment were quantified using high resolution gamma spectrometry and thick source beta counting in the laboratory, coupled with water content analysis and in-situ gamma dose rate measurements. Quartz was extracted using standard laboratory procedures, and purity checked with scanning electron microscopy. Equivalent doses were determined, initially, on 16 aliquots of quartz per sample using the quartz single-aliquot regenerative (SAR) procedure, with additional investigation of further sets of 16 to build statistical power for selected pre-heating groups. Radial plotting methods were used to appraise sample homogeneity, and robust statistics were used, for aliquots satisfying SAR acceptance criteria, to estimate equivalent doses. The quartz OSL SAR age estimates have been assessed relative to the stratigraphy of the wheelhouse, in combination with profiling data using both conventional assimilation methods and also a Bayesian approach. Both approaches lead to similar conclusions concerning the overall chronology of site construction, occupation and abandonment as summarised here. (i) 	OSL profiling verifies that material associated with the earliest Iron Age occupation of the wheelhouse and preceding structure(s) in the vicinity can be found, outside the wheelhouse, in midden deposits which surround and overlie the surviving structures. This material goes back to approximately 400 BC, and some of it predates the wheelhouse construction. (ii) 	The preceding burnt surface represents a structure of short-lived duration, which spanned the period first/second century BC to the first century AD. Material associated within this structure and its use may be present in the midden deposits around the wheelhouse. (iii) 	The most probable period for construction of the wheelhouse is in the first/second century AD. (iv) 	In the monument, material dating to the earliest occupation of the wheelhouse is preserved in the northern chamber, and its associated pits. OSL profiling indicates that the northern chamber was in use during all period of occupation, from the Iron Age construction of the wheelhouse (c AD 150) through to the first millennium AD abandonment of the site (c AD 900 - 1000). (v) 	In the southern chamber, the earliest occupation phases are poorly represented in surviving debris. The collapse of the southern wall (c AD 600 - 750), the rebuild (c AD 750), the last occupation the southern chamber (c AD 750), and abandonment of the southern chamber (c AD 750) all occur in the later part of the first millennium AD, significantly after the wheelhouse construction and earlier phases of occupation. (vi) 	After the southern chamber was abandoned, the central and northern chambers remained in use. The central chamber contains a hearth sequence, which indicates occupation of this chamber through a later phase of occupation (700 AD) until the Norse period (AD 940). OSL profiles provide some evidence of earlier occupation in the central area. (vii) 	Final abandonment of the site is registered by clean abandonment sands starting from the tenth century AD, consistent with abandonment in the Norse period, and with the upper occupation in the northern and central chambers. Later evidence of aeolian activity through the Little Ice Age (up to 16 th century AD) is also recorded in the upper sand fills of the central and northern chambers. The combination of field and laboratory luminescence profiling techniques, and quartz OSL SAR dating, has provided a chronological framework to interpret the complete sequence of construction, occupation and phased abandonment of the wheelhouse structure. To our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that field and laboratory luminescence profiling techniques coupled to quantitative OSL SAR analysis and Bayesian assimilation methods have been applied to define the complete sequence of construction, occupation and abandonment of a site of this type. A further review of other artefact, environmental and dating evidence, would be useful as the rest of the post-excavation work advances...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} the {{electronic}} portal imaging device (EPID) to acquire a large two-dimensional array of digitized x-ray data in real time is extremely attractive for dosimetric measurements. To evaluate the potential use of an EPID for portal dose measurement in Wellington Blood and Cancer Centre, some dosimetric characteristics of the Varian's PortalVisionTM aS 500 were investigated. PortalVisionTM incorporates an amorphous silicon detector (aSi). Some potential applications of EPID in linac QA were also explored. The EPID's performance for linearity with MU and dose rate was verified and it {{was found to be}} proportional over the entire measured range. Short term repeatability was found to be excellent. An investigation of calibration method to improve dosimetric accuracy demonstrated two methods of avoiding detector saturation. Firstly, acquiring flood field with the use of additional buildup and secondly, increasing the source to detector distance for calibration. A study of EPIDs behaviour under conditions of varying dose rate which commonly arise in EDW treatment techniques was carried out. The EPID exhibited a field size dependence in addition to a 8 % discrepancy on the `hot edge' of EDW profiles. Further investigation into the field size dependence and the discrepancy at hot edge is required. EPIDs ability to acquire asymmetric field profile was also investigated.

40|$|Source {{partitioning}} of eddy covariance measurements {{is routinely}} {{used for a}} better understanding of the exchange of greenhouse gases, especially between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. Quantifications of CO 2 and H 2 O fluxes, their dynamics, variabilities and feedbacks with environmental drivers give a better insight of the biosphere’s sensitivity towards global change. The BMBF-funded project “Instrumental and Data-driven Approaches to Source-Partitioning of Greenhouse Gas Fluxes: Comparison, Combination, Advancement” (IDAS-GHG) aims at comparing and improving existing methods for partitioning of CO 2 and H 2 O fluxes into their respective raw components. Data-driven approaches use existing (raw or processed) data of typical eddy covariance stations. Instrumental approaches of source partitioning require additional measurements at different parts of ecosystems and different methods, e. g. soil-flux <b>chamber</b> measurements, <b>profile</b> measurements or tracer measurements (isotopes). This present study is part of the data-driven approaches, using some results from additional profile measurements to gain further insights. SCANLON and SAHU (2008), and SCANLON and KUSTAS (2010) proposed an interesting method to estimate the contributions of photosynthesis, soil respiration (autotrophic and heterotrophic sources), transpiration and evaporation using measured high-frequency time series of CO 2 and H 2 O fluxes - no extra instrumentation necessary. This method (SK 10 in the following) is based on the dissimilarities of sources and sinks of CO 2 and water vapor among the sub-canopy, canopy and atmosphere, which lead to unique “signals” in the eddy covariance measurements for air transported from differing locations. Thus, the flux-variance similarity theory is separately applied to the stomatal and non-stomatal components of the regarded fluxes. In this study we apply the SK 10 analysis to observations of several agroecosystems, and compare the results to outcomes of other well-known source partitioning methods as well as to <b>chamber</b> and <b>profile</b> measurements. For example, state variables measured in the canopy air are used to test the profile assumption required by SK 10 analysis. Scanlon, T. M., Kustas, W. P., 2010.

In this flow, the oscillations result from an acoustic resonance, and have amplitudes of up to 5 times the mean velocity. Oscillation frequencies were varied from 67 to 101 Hz. Spatially resolved temperature measurements were made to within 400 [mu]m of the wall, providing cycle-resolved profiles of the temperature and the random temperature fluctuations. The combustor-cycle phase relationships among the gas temperature, random-temperature-fluctuation intensity, velocity, and combustion chamber pressure, are compared. Velocity field effects dominated the cyclic {{behavior of}} the gas temperature, over the effects of isentropic compressive heating and the convection of hot pockets of gas from the combustion <b>chamber.</b> Cycle-resolved <b>profiles</b> show the gas temperature to be constant across the tail pipe, except for a boundary layer region, at all times during the cycle. Although cyclic temperature oscillations of more than 200 K were observed, the thermal boundary layer was well developed at all times during the cycle. The gas temperature was greater than the wall temperature at all cycle times, unlike the reversing velocity field, indicating that Reynolds analogy between momentum and thermal transport is not valid in this flow. Time-resolved wall heat flux was also measured and its fundamental oscillation {{is found to be}} in phase with that of the gas temperature...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{parameters}} influenced on the heat transfer in the circulating fluidized bed boiler is distribution of bed’s solids concentration within the contour of boiler’s combustion chamber. In this paper analysis of influence of fluidized bed’s solids concentration on the vertical temperature profile in the combustion chamber of SC-OTU CFB boiler is carried out. Investigations were conducted with different loads of generator’s nominal power i. e. 100 %, 80 %, 60 % and 40 %. Solids concentration was specified {{on the base of}} pressure measurement within boiler’s combustion chamber using pressure sensors.

40|$|Purpose: A {{major problem}} {{associated}} with amorphous silicon (a-Si) electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) for transit dosimetry {{is the presence}} of a phosphor layer, which can introduce large deviations from water-equivalent behavior due to energy-dependent response and visible light scattering. In this study, an amorphous silicon EPID was modified to a direct detection configuration by removing the phosphor layer, and the accuracy of using it for transit dosimetry measurements was investigated for 6 and 18 MV treatment beams by comparison to ion-chamber in water measurements. Methods: Solid water and copper were both evaluated as buildup materials. Using the optimum buildup thickness in each case, effects of changes in radiation field size, source to detector distance, and patient/phantom thickness were investigated by comparison to reference measurements made by an ionization chamber on the central axis. The off-axis response of the imager was also investigated by comparison of EPID image profiles to dose profiles obtained by a scanning ionization chamber in a water tank with various thicknesses of slab phantoms, and an anthropomorphic phantom in the beam using Gamma evaluation (3 %, 3 mm criteria). The imaging characteristics of the direct EPID were investigated by comparison to a commercial EPID using QC 3 V phantom, and by taking images of an anthropomorphic pelvic phantom containing fiducial gold markers. Results: Either 30 mm of solid water or 3. 3 mm of copper were found to be the most suitable buildup thicknesses with solid water providing more accurate results. Using solid water buildup, the EPID response compared to the reference dosimeter within 2 % for all conditions except phantom thicknesses larger than 25 cm in 6 MV beams, which was up to 6. 5 %. Gamma evaluation results comparing EPID profiles and reference ionization <b>chamber</b> <b>profiles</b> showed that for 6 and 18 MV beams, at least 91. 8 % and 90. 9 % of points had a Gamma< 1 for all phantoms, respectively. But using copper buildup, the EPID response had more discrepancies from the ionization chamber reference measurements, including: More than 2 % difference for small air gaps using 6 MV beams, up to 8 % difference for phantom thicknesses larger than 25 cm in 6 MV beams, and large differences (up to 9. 3 %) for increasing phantom thicknesses in 18 MV beams. The percentage of points with Gamma< 1 with copper buildup were at least 96. 6 % and 99. 8 % in 6 and 18 MV beams, respectively. Conclusions: The direct EPID performs as an ion-chamber detector for transit dosimetry applications in all geometries studied except for small discrepancies at 6 MV for thick phantoms. This can be ameliorated by the calibration of the EPID to dose at an intermediate phantom thickness. The major current limitation of the direct EPID is poor quality of images compared with the clinical configuration, which could be overcome by a method to interchange between imaging and dosimetry setups...|$|R
40|$|Objectives:  The {{present study}} focused on the {{development}} of a optic fiber sensor for carbon dioxide (CO 2), the measuring of variations of the refractive index of a CO 2 medium undergoing controlled changes of temperature and pressure, and comparing this experimental refractive index with a calculated theoretical refractive index. Materials and methods: For the making of the optical sensor, we used samples of 48 to 56 micrometers inner diameter micro-structured optic fiber with a solid silica covered hollow center; and we selected dimethilformamide as the light conductor fluid. The fiber was filled with pressure; the connectrorization of the fiber was made with the fussion, the high-temperature afhesive, and the mechanical processes. We use a refractometer for measuring the refractive index during the temperature and pressure change processes in the CO 2 <b>chamber.</b> Results: <b>Profiles</b> of the refractive index vs. temperature in cooling and heating cycles were obtained, as well as the punctual measures of the refractive index in five fixed thermodynamic points tested; the calculation for the theoretical refractive index for these points was obtained, and was compared with the experimental ones. The percentage of error of the experimental refractive index was estimated between 0. 016 % and 0. 03 %. Conclussions: We achieved the measuring of transmission of white light through a fluid in different phases, and we registered significant changes in the refractive index in each phase change using the fabricated optic sensor...|$|R

Chamber technique has been approved to be a potential way, while the configuration and change of the environmental condition in headspace of the <b>chamber,</b> wind <b>profile</b> in particular, may result in a systematic error and is not clearly specified yet. Three unvented cylindrical non-steady state flow-through chambers with different configurations were made and tested by using SF 6 as a tracer gas, and impact of the chamber size and wind profile in the headspace was evaluated in this study. Results showed that the chamber measured and referred SF 6 fluxes had a significant linear relationship. Footprint area of the chamber didnâ€™t affect the measurement, while the height had a significant influence on its performance. It might because that the higher chamber reduced the effect of additional air-fill volume in emitting source below the chamber and hence increased the measuring accuracy. Wind speed and positive pressure generated by the mixing fan in the headspace had no significant impact on the measurement performance of the chamber. It may be explained by the offset effect between wind speed and positive pressure generated by the mixing fan inside the chamber, which could be verified in further studies...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} {{the characteristics of a}} commercial ion chamber array and its performance in the verification of radiotherapy plans. The device was the 2 D Array Seven 29 ™ model (PTW, Freiburg, Germany). This is a two-dimensional detector array with 729 ionization chambers uniformly arranged in a 27 × 27 matrix with an active area of 27 × 27 cm 2. The detector short-, medium- and long-term reproducibility have been tested through an extensive set of repeated measurements. Short-term reproducibility was well within 0. 2 %. Medium- and long-term reproducibility were within 1 %, including set-up reproducibility errors and linac output fluctuations. Dose linearity was also assessed. The system response to dose was verified to be linear within the range 2 – 500 MU. Output factors matched very well pinpoint chamber measurements performed in the same experimental conditions with a maximum local percentage difference of 0. 4 %. Furthermore, the 2 D Array sensitivity to millimetric collimator positional changes and to perturbation effect of irradiated area was tested. The comparison with ion chamber data carried out in water was very satisfying. Finally, measurements of wedge-modulated fields and IMRT beam sequence matched very well ion <b>chamber</b> dose <b>profiles</b> acquired in a water tank. The extensive tests performed in this investigation show that the 2 D Array Seven 29 is a reliable and accurate dosimeter and that it could be a useful tool for the quality assurance and the verification of radiotherapy plans...|$|R

The {{characteristics of the}} commercial SCDD model 60019 (PTW) with 6 - and 15 -MV photon beams, and 208 -MeV proton beams, were investigated and compared with the pre-characterized detectors: Semiflex (model 31010) and PinPoint (model 31006) ionization chambers (PTW), the EDGE diode detector (Sun Nuclear Corp) and the SFD Stereotactic Dosimetry Diode Detector (IBA). To evaluate {{the effects of the}} pre-irradiation, the diamond detector, which had not been irradiated on the day, was set up in the water tank, and the response to 100 MU was measured every 20 s. The depth–dose and profiles data were collected for various field sizes and depths. For all radiation types and field sizes, the depth–dose data of the diamond chamber showed identical curves to those of the ionization <b>chambers.</b> The <b>profile</b> of the diamond detector was very {{similar to those of the}} EDGE and SFD detectors, although the Semiflex and PinPoint chambers showed volume-averaging effects in the penumbrae region. The temperature dependency was within 0. 7 % in the range of 4 – 41 °C. A dose of 900 cGy and 1200 cGy was needed to stabilize the chamber to the level within 0. 5 % and 0. 2 %, respectively. The PTW type 60019 SCDD detector showed suitable characteristics for radiation dosimetry, for relative dose, depth–dose and profile measurements for a wide range of field sizes.

40|$|An {{overview}} of edge and divertor physics research on ASDEX Upgrade of relevance for next-step fusion devices like ITER is presented. The results described were primarily obtained in lower single-null divertor configurations with three consecutive bottom divertor designs, starting from an initial open divertor (Div I) over the closed LYRA configuration (Div II), optimized for low-triangularity single-null equilibria, to the presently operational variant Div IIb, fitting a large variety of plasma shapes. The upper, geometrically open divertor structure remained essentially unchanged. A dedicated diagnostics system {{in combination with}} advanced plasma control scenarios and extensive numerical modeling allowed for {{a detailed analysis of}} edge and divertor physics mechanisms. Main <b>chamber</b> edge <b>profiles</b> exhibit a double structure, especially pronounced in high-performance H-mode plasmas. While radial transport inside and across the separatrix is governed by critical gradients, the cold scrape-off layer wing shows rapid diffusion or even outward drift, probably related to intermittent crossfield transport. The divertor behavior has been studied for the different divertor geometries and for all operational regimes of interest. Closed divertor operation enhances divertor recycling and pumping, reduces the power load on target plates by increased upstream losses, and facilitates onset of plasma detachment. The transient power load during type I ELMs, however, remains high and problematic, while the small type III ELMs, appearing, for example, in radiative discharge scenarios, and especially the type II ELMs are nearly invisible on the target heat flux. Despite this strong effect of divertor geometry on the divertor behavior, its direct effect on core confinement remains small...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an approximate method for estimating effects of turbulence on the unsteady flowfield {{and on the}} stability of wave motions in a solid propellant rocket chamber. Recent work has illuminated the laminar features of this problem. The objective of the present work is to determine in a simplified way some {{of the effects of}} turbulence on these processes. A fundamental question to be answered {{is whether or not the}} presence of fully developed turbulence modifies the linearized stability integrals (e. g. flow-turning) that arise naturally in the laminar analysis. The problem is treated by combining realistic numerical solutions for the turbulent field with detailed analytical solutions for the organized oscillatory gas motions. The main influence of turbulence is modification of the transport properties and the mean <b>chamber</b> velocity <b>profile.</b> The results show that the organized vorticity waves that fill the entire chamber in the laminar case reduce to a thin acoustic boundary layer in the presence of strong turbulence. From the standpoint of vorticity production, this can be viewed as a transition from organized vorticity associated with the periodic wave structure to the wideband vorticity distribution of the turbulent field. This process is similar in many respects to the turbulent transition process in a flow without organized oscillations. In that case organized oscillations (e. g. Tollmein-Schlichting waves) appear naturally as an intermediate stage in the transition to a fully turbulent field. Despite the major impact of turbulence on the flow geometry, there is little change in linear acoustic stability gain/loss terms related to vorticity propagation. This reinforces the concept that the flow-turning interaction is not the result of viscous losses at the chamber boundaries. However, it is clear that stochastic fluctuations can have a major influence on the flame zone dynamic behavior especially in the nozzle end of a long motor burning port where the flow becomes fully turbulent...|$|R
