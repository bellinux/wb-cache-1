Using evidence from Italy we suggest that tackling demographic, educational, and income inequalities is necessary, even in low cost areas, to support further broadband penetration. We estimate logistic regressions of Internet and broadband use at home, and show that a substantial increase of broadband penetration is possible in Italy only if specific platforms and applications are made available to older and less educated households.

40|$|Free {{choice and}} <b>competitive</b> <b>neutrality</b> are often {{assigned}} particular importance for suc-cessful market reform of public service. The {{aim of this}} article is to illuminate the practi-cal work that goes into regulating free choice and <b>competitive</b> <b>neutrality</b> in a primary care market in a Swedish county council. The article asks: How is regulation of free choice and <b>competitive</b> <b>neutrality</b> in the primary care market carried out? Are there any particular challenges in working with this? If so, why? The article presents a qualitative case study and approaches the research questions with a market practice perspective. By studying how the work with a rulebook for authorization of care centers is carried out, detailed knowledge of the market regulatory process is gained. The result illustrates how purchas-er officials frame the market with the rulebook. However, the ways free choice and com-petitive neutrality plays out it practice overflows the market frame. Overflows are caused by multiple, and conflicting, modes of calculations enacted by the rulebook. Therefore, free choice and <b>competitive</b> <b>neutrality</b> does not create the effects that policy-makers have expected in the primary care market...|$|E
40|$|This {{working paper}} {{provides}} a comprehensive {{overview of the}} <b>competitive</b> <b>neutrality</b> framework of the Australian Commonwealth {{as well as individual}} States. It reviews the history behind the framework and provides examples of cases brought before the respective complaints handling offices. Finally, the paper draws conclusions regarding the successes and failures of the Australian framework and its applicability to other jurisdictions. The working paper argues that Australia. s <b>competitive</b> <b>neutrality</b> framework can be viewed as highly successful overall. However, the success can probably only be copied by other countries if these are willing to undertake similarly profound reforms as were engendered as part of the Australian competition reforms in the 1990 s with the active participation of the Productivity Commission. The factors behind Australia. s apparent success include: a reform program that applied both to SOEs and to specific industries; the flexibility to apply the framework differently in different geographic contexts; anchoring the commitment to <b>competitive</b> <b>neutrality</b> in strong administrative processes; regular reviews and reporting by individual jurisdictions on the progress of their reforms; clarity in communication to enhance a nationwide understanding of the goals and mechanisms to achieve those goals; transparent public benefit tests to establish the boundaries between commercial and non-commercial public activities; and transparent and politically independent review processes. state-owned enterprises, competitive advantages, sectoral reforms, competition policy, <b>competitive</b> <b>neutrality,</b> corporate governance...|$|E
40|$|<b>Competitive</b> <b>neutrality</b> {{implies that}} no {{business}} entity is advantaged (or disadvantaged) {{solely because of}} its ownership. The Paper argues that far from all SOEs have the opportunity or the incentives to act in an anti-competitive way, and a trend in recent decades toward more fully corporatised and commercially operating SOEs has no doubt improved overall efficiency. However, problems remain, not least in the network industries where many remaining SOEs are market incumbents that continue to enjoy monopolies in part of their value chains or government subsidies, purportedly in compensation for public service obligations. Renewed concerns about <b>competitive</b> <b>neutrality</b> have also arisen from the market entry of SOEs domiciled in countries where the process of corporatisation has yet to run its full course. To counter these problems some OECD countries {{as well as the}} European Union have established specific <b>competitive</b> <b>neutrality</b> frameworks. These frameworks go beyond addressing the anti-competitive behaviour of SOEs, to also establish mechanisms to identify and eliminate such competitive advantages as they may have, including with respect to taxation, financing costs and regulatory neutrality. The experience so far with such formal arrangements is generally encouraging. Jurisdictions that have them have generally been successful in rolling back state subsidies and, on the evidence to date, have obtained significant economic efficiency gains. The Working Paper concludes that a full implementation of the OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises {{would go a long way}} in ensuring <b>competitive</b> <b>neutrality.</b> The business activities of currently unincorporated segments of the government sector would become much more competitive and accountable if they were made subject to the Guidelines. For incorporated SOEs the Guidelines also include a portmanteau recommendation of a “level playing field”. However, they offer only limited concrete recommendations on how governments are expected to obtain this outcome in practice. The Guidelines are moreover weakly implemented in a number of countries. state-owned enterprises, competitive advantages, <b>competitive</b> <b>neutrality,</b> corporate governance, corporate neutrality...|$|E

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{responds to}} Income Tax Discrimination: Still Stuck in a Labyrinth of Impossibility by Professors Michael Graetz and Alvin Warren (121 Yale L. J. 1118). In that article, Professors Graetz and Warren challenge {{many of the}} arguments we made in our own article entitled, “What is Tax Discrimination?” (121 Yale L. J. 1014). In our earlier article, {{we set out to}} accomplish two goals. First, we sought to identify the principle behind the doctrine of tax discrimination as that doctrine is applied by the U. S. Supreme Court and the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) and to translate that principle into economic terms. Second, we sought to describe how courts can advance that principle through case law. Part I of this article defends our argument that the courts interpret the tax nondiscrimination principle to require “competitive neutrality,” a concept closely related both to the colloquial notion of a “level playing field” between domestic and cross-border economic actors and to the formal economic concept of capital ownership neutrality (CON). Among other topics covered in Part I, we defend our focus on efficiency as the principal decision-making criterion used by courts for deciding tax discrimination cases, explain how we translated the concept of CON into the labor context, defend our focus on cross-border workers as the only group of workers who are legally relevant to the tax nondiscrimination question, provide some preliminary thoughts on the differences between “restriction” cases and tax “discrimination” cases, and provide further discussion of our interpretive sources. Part II fleshes out our argument that in the absence of cross-border harmonization of tax rates and bases <b>competitive</b> <b>neutrality</b> requires two conditions. The first condition is that all states must agree on one of two methods of avoiding double taxation on interstate commerce. The two alternative methods are worldwide taxation with unlimited foreign tax credits and what we call “ideal deduction”, which includes territorial taxation as one instantiation. The second condition is that all taxes must be uniform on either a source or residence basis. A source tax is uniform if it applies in the same manner to all income from the same source state without regard to the residence of the taxpayer who earns that income; a residence tax is uniform if it applies in the same manner to all income earned by a resident regardless of source. In our original article, we noted that both the ECJ and the U. S. Supreme Court disclaim authority to force states to agree on a method of avoiding double taxation. Accordingly, because it would not be possible for courts to enforce both conditions required to achieve <b>competitive</b> <b>neutrality,</b> we argued that if, as it appears, the courts desire to promote <b>competitive</b> <b>neutrality</b> through the doctrine of tax discrimination, they can do so by enforcing the uniformity requirement. Among other topics covered in Part II, we provide responses to specific questions and challenges raised by Graetz and Warren, including how ideal deduction would work with graduated tax rates and variations in national tax bases and whether ideal deduction could achieve <b>competitive</b> <b>neutrality</b> in the absence of fixed residence In Part II, we also provide resolutions for three factual scenarios that Graetz and Warren posed and for which they claim that a <b>competitive</b> <b>neutrality</b> interpretation of tax discrimination provides no resolution...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to analyze the {{implementation}} process of Basel II so to understand whether {{and to what extent}} national discrepancies might cause problems of <b>competitive</b> <b>neutrality</b> and thus invalidate the significant level of harmonization in capital adequacy regulation which was successfully achieved by Basel I. To achieve this result, this work looks at three different issues. The first paper looks at the negotiation process of an international soft law agreement and tries to understand whether it is able to explain its implementation results in terms of the actual degree of compliance across different countries. A game theory coordination model is suggested as a theoretical answer to this question, while the two Basel Accord cases are used to test the model empirically. The appreciation of the circumstances that led to the two Accords is proved as indicative of the reasons behind the widespread adoption of the Basel I Accord as opposed to the piecemeal implementation of Basel II. The {{aim of the}} second paper is then focus on the actual implementation of Basel II and to analyze how its second Pillar is likely to impact the banking industry in Europe. It finds evidence of a piecemeal implementation of Pillar II rules across Member States (MSs) which, in turn, is able to cause an alteration of the level playing field among banks depending on the country they are incorporated in,. It concludes that there is a clear case for further harmonization not only by reducing the extent of national discretions at the regulatory level, but more importantly in building up further arrangements for supervisory convergence and coordination. With the third paper the attention is finally drawn to possible problems of <b>competitive</b> <b>neutrality</b> arising from the fact that under Basel II "standardized" banks' level of capital is indirectly determined by rating agencies. Being their predictions often inconsistent one with the other, banks can in principle enact regulatory arbitrage strategies. And despite minimum standards are required by means of a common recognition process, the consistency of national authorities' assessment is still not guaranteed and banks might thus be provided with undue regulatory capital relief. A more institutional answer is needed if Europe wants in real fact to ensure <b>competitive</b> <b>neutrality</b> across MSs...|$|E

Synergies arise from combining high-powered incentives for quality provision (emanating from private firms) with low rents (public firms).
