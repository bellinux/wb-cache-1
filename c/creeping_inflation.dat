500|$|As James's reign progressed, his {{government}} faced growing financial pressures, due partly to <b>creeping</b> <b>inflation</b> {{but also to}} the profligacy and financial incompetence of James's court. In February 1610, Salisbury proposed a scheme, known as the Great Contract, whereby Parliament, in return for ten royal concessions, would grant a lump sum of £600,000 to pay off the king's debts plus an annual grant of £200,000. The ensuing prickly negotiations became so protracted that James eventually lost patience and dismissed Parliament on 31 December 1610. [...] "Your greatest error", he told Salisbury, [...] "hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall". The same pattern was repeated with the so-called [...] "Addled Parliament" [...] of 1614, which James dissolved after a mere nine weeks when the Commons hesitated to grant him the money he required. James then ruled without parliament until 1621, employing officials such as the merchant Lionel Cranfield, who were astute at raising and saving money for the crown, and sold baronetcies and other dignities, many created for the purpose, as an alternative source of income.|$|E
5000|$|The {{distribution}} of funds [...] among the parties that elect federal MPs has stayed {{more or less}} stable for many years. Just one change is noteworthy: whereas {{at the turn of}} the century the financial means of the major parties were more balanced, recently the governing CDU/CSU has re-established its traditional lead in financial terms. The total outlay for up to 30 other parties that are not represented federally is less than 10 percent of the overall party expenses (as well as revenue). During the years 1984 to 1989, all German parties together spent a total of €5 to 7 per German citizen (person entitled to vote, voter on list). For 1991 to 2009, the annual aggregate per capita spending amounted to some €5 to 10. Taking the rate of <b>creeping</b> <b>inflation</b> into account, German parties have had a hard time to keep up their previous spending levels.|$|E
5000|$|The {{campaign}} focused {{mainly on}} issues {{arising from the}} general election, which had brought the Conservatives to power {{after six years of}} Labour government. For the Conservatives the focus was on the cost of living: [...] "we are applying the brakes to arrest the disastrous fall in the buying power of the pound ... we are determined {{to put a stop to}} the <b>creeping</b> <b>inflation</b> which is not only eating into our social services, pensions and savings, but destroying our capacity to import the food and raw materials by which we live". Labour insisted that the Conservatives had won the general election by blaming the party for all the difficulties of the post war period: [...] "They now admit ... that they were caused by circumstances outside the control of any Government" [...] and warned that cuts in social services [...] "might foreshadow more serious attacks on the welfare State in the Budget".|$|E
25|$|The Tax Reform Act of 1986 and {{its impact}} on the {{alternative}} minimum tax (AMT) reduced nominal rates on the wealthy and eliminated tax deductions, while raising tax rates on lower-income individuals. The across the board tax system reduced marginal rates and further reduced bracket <b>creep</b> from <b>inflation.</b> The highest income earners (with incomes exceeding $1,000,000) received a tax break, restoring a flatter tax system. In 2006, the IRS's National Taxpayer Advocate's report characterized the effective rise in the AMT for individuals as a problem with the tax code. Through 2007, the revised AMT had brought in more tax revenue than the former tax code, which has made it difficult for Congress to reform.|$|R
50|$|Credentialism and {{educational}} inflation {{are any of}} a number of related processes involving increased demands for formal educational qualifications, and the devaluation of these qualifications. In Western society, there have been increasing requirements for formal qualifications or certification for jobs, a process called credentialism that is not easily differentiated from valid professionalization. This process has, in turn, led to credential inflation (also known as credential <b>creep,</b> academic <b>inflation</b> or degree inflation), the process of inflation of the minimum credentials required for a given job and the simultaneous devaluation of the value of diplomas and degrees. These trends are also associated with grade inflation, a tendency to award progressively higher academic grades for work that would have received lower grades in the past. In countries in the Middle East, where the rulers have traditionally used public sector jobs as a form of political appeasement for the middle classes, this has resulted in many youth seeking university degrees that are only suited for work in public sector roles, making them unqualified for private sector roles.|$|R
40|$|No {{doubt that}} the {{persistent}} rise in the price levels of commodities and services adversely affects the economic performance. The goal {{of each and every}} Government is to maintain low and relatively stable levels of <b>inflation.</b> <b>Creeping</b> or mild <b>inflation</b> can be viewed as having favorable impacts on the economy; on the other hand zero inflation is harmful to other sectors in the economy. The right level of inflation, is somewhere in the middle. The study analyzed the major determinants of inflation in India extracting 54 time series quarterly observations. The study employed Johansen-juselius cointegration methodology to test for the existence of a long run relationship between the variables. The cointegrating regression so far considers only the long-run property of the model, and does not deal with the short-run dynamics explicitly. For this, the error correction from the long run determinants of inflation is then used as a dynamic model to estimate the short run determinants of inflation. The study concluded that the GDP and broad money {{have a positive effect on}} the inflation in long run. On the other hand, interest rate and exchange rate has a negative effect. The income coefficient is 0. 37 and showing significant, implying that in India, a one percent increase in income while others keep constant contributes 0. 37 % increase in inflation. Similarly the money coefficient is 0. 047 and showing significant, implying that in India, one percent increase in money supply leads to a 5 % increase in price level...|$|R

5000|$|As James's reign progressed, his {{government}} faced growing financial pressures. Some of those resulted from <b>creeping</b> <b>inflation</b> and the decreasing {{purchasing power of}} the royal income, but James's profligacy and financial incompetence substantially contributed to the mounting debt. Salisbury took over the reins as Lord Treasurer himself in 1608 and, {{with the backing of}} the Privy Council, introduced a programme of economic reforms which steadily drove down the deficit. In an attempt to convince James to curb his extravagance, he wrote a series of frank tracts on the matter, and he tried to induce the king to grant limited pensions to his courtiers, rather than showering them with random gifts. A believer in the necessity of parliamentary contribution to government, Salisbury proposed to the Commons, in February 1610, an ambitious financial scheme, known as The Great Contract, whereby Parliament would grant a lump sum of £600,000 to pay off the king's debts in return for ten royal concessions, plus an annual grant of £200,000. Though the Commons agreed to the annual grant, the negotiations over the lump sum became so protracted and difficult that James eventually lost patience and dismissed the parliament on 31 December 1610. [...] "Your greatest error," [...] he told Salisbury, [...] "hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall". Salisbury, however, made it clear that without parliamentary subsidies, he could do no more to manage the Crown's financial crisis. The subsequent downfall of the Howards left George Villiers, now earl of Buckingham, unchallenged as the supreme figure in the government by 1618. [...] James had been attempting to rule without Parliament since the [...] "Addled Parliament" [...] of 1614, which he had dissolved after eight weeks when it proved reluctant to grant him money.Buckingham addressed the search for alternative revenues, employing officials, such as the businessman Lionel Cranfield, who were astute in raising and saving money for the Crown. Cash was also raised by selling earldoms and other dignities, many created by James himself.|$|E
30|$|Inflation is the unremitting and unrepressed {{increasing}} in price level {{of goods and}} services that subsequently decrease the purchasing power of currency and economic growth of any economy. Demand pull theory stated that inflation increases when demand {{of goods and services}} increase as compared to aggregate demand for goods and services. Namjour et al. (2014) categorized inflation into three different types. <b>Creeping</b> <b>Inflation</b> is that type of inflation, which increase within the range of 1 to 6 % or 4 to 8 % in 1 year. The other type of inflation is severe inflation in this type of Inflation, the price level increases rapidly as compared to <b>Creeping</b> <b>Inflation,</b> it ranges within 15 to 25 % per year. The last type of inflation is very severe Inflation also known as hyperinflation is the most dangerous type of inflation; in this type of inflation the prices of goods and services increases up to 50 % every six months. Inflation is very essential.|$|E
40|$|Committee (FOMC) {{described}} {{its policy}} stance {{as one of}} “watchful waiting. ” In {{the second half of}} that year, especially, the FOMC stood poised to counter the emergence of any inflationary imbalances that would threaten the ongoing economic expansion. No policy tightening was actually implemented in 1996, so the only action was a slight policy ease on January 31 in response to concerns about a slowing economy. In this article, we analyze the FOMC’s 1996 policy stance and argue that the Committee’s immediate objective was to maximize the horizon for which a healthy economic expansion would be expected to continue. For its part, the FOMC has indicated that the prevention of any upward <b>creep</b> in <b>inflation</b> is vital to the continued health of the expansion, but that near-term decreases in the trend rate of inflation are not. Support for this interpretation is found in published summaries of the 1996 FOMC meetings and public statements by Committee members. We also describe widely-discussed pieces of research that figured in the 1996 monetary policy debate. 1 On balance, we conclude that the most influential academic research lent the FOMC caution in considering the immediate implementation of actions aimed at realizing its long-run goal of price stability. Moreover, even if FOMC members are skeptical of the validity of a given study’s policy implications, they must consider that study’s impact on opinion in broader policy circles. We begin this article with a positive description of the FOMC’s actions in 1996 vis-a-vis two estimates of the policy-implied inflation rate. We then discuss the implications of several pieces of recent academic research and their impact on the monetary policy debate...|$|R
40|$|Using German income {{distribution}} in 2009, this paper studies the redistributive and revenue effects of bracket <b>creep</b> under various <b>inflation</b> scenarios. We develop a tax micro-simulation {{model for the}} newly available Panel on Household Finance (PHF) data. The simulation yields an inverted U-shaped overall redistributive effect of the income tax and social insurance contribution system {{with respect to the}} inflation rate, which contrasts with Immervoll (2005) who finds that fiscal drag always enhances the equalising effect. The nominal income growth as well as the deterioration of tax progression at the middle and top of the {{income distribution}} between 1998 and 2009 can be the impetus for this change. This result implies that delaying adjustment might reduce redistribution. We also suggest that these results might not be restricted solely to Germany. Additionally, when we introduce the empirical evidence that capital income grows faster than non-capital income &#x 10074 e; > &#x 100743;, the dual tax system with a flat capital income tax implemented in 2009 further disequalises the after-tax income substantially. Allowing inflation compensation to lean towards the poor by boosting their share of capital income may not be favourable to redistribution...|$|R

40|$|A simple {{framework}} is constructed and extended {{to consider the}} theory of investment. It shows that there exists in industrialized economies a certain structure that determines the balance curve, which relates the rates of inflation and capital accumulation if demand and productive capacity are to be balanced as a whole at the initial stage of the next period. The balance curve, together with the modified short-period Phillips curve, governs the behavior of industrialized economies. In other words, they {{make it possible to}} recognize coherently the mechanism of chief economic phenomena such as growth, business cycles, <b>creeping</b> <b>inflation</b> and stagflation, and accordingly to prescribe for "diseases.

40|$|This article {{provides}} information on economist Lucien Albert Hahn 2 ̆ 7 s influence on economics, and highlights similarity between Hahn and A. W. Phillips. Hahn 2 ̆ 7 s work was, in some important circles, fairly central to what Gottfried Haberler called the last great debate on inflation in the 1950 s. The great debate in the 1970 s was over the Phillips curve trade-off; in the 1950 s, economist Sumner H. Slichter advocated the proposition that <b>creeping</b> <b>inflation</b> could be permanently tolerated. The context was the Delphic Oracular quality of the 1946 U. S. Employment Act, and the apparent incompatibility of the pursuit of full employment with price stability. Hahn was said to believe that reductions in demand that occur as the economy rids itself of maladjustments can lead to disequilibrating declines in income by causing the demand for speculative money balances to increase. He called this a deflationary depression. But the monetarist mechanism is an equilibrating story whereby the macrosystem can only move along an S-shaped trajectory, in inflation-unemployment space. Along {{the top half of}} the S, a Keynesian fall in the price of money can be temporary. Along the bottom half of the S, a monetarist rise in the price of money will dissipate itself by inducing self-destructing delusions about inflationary expectations...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{experience}} of the Latin – American countries, and more recently, {{of the countries in}} the Eastern Europe, has proved that the periods of huge economic instability are associated to inflationary phenomena (that can degenerate into hyper – or mega inflation). Despite some attempts to weaken the negative effects of the inflation, the history of the last century stands as a living proof that the financial vulnerability of an economy, manifested through inflation, generally leads to strong imbalances both at a social level as well as at an economic one. Most of the economic agents become aware rather late of the inflationist shocks and do not become accustomed to them, and therefore such differences as those between business companies and the members of a society will come out. As expected, some governments can control the economic process during times of <b>creeping</b> <b>inflation,</b> but the price of the success is usually paid by the large mass of the private consumers. Since all the economic measures are expressed through monetary unities, any change of prices will make its presence felt in the financial structure of the economic activit y, in the budget of the incomes and of the costs, and last but not least, in their economic - monetary equilibrium. Inflation touches directly upon the monetary – bookkeeping information used by the leading team in the decision activity, thus bringing about the decrease of its credibility as well as the possibility, in many cases, to wrongly tackle the developing strategies of the companies. At the same time, laying taxes upon the positive nominal incomes {{as well as on the}} real - valued negative incomes will result in the decapitalization of the business companies, phenomena also known under the name of ‘the run off of the capital...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{positioning of}} the German Hyperinflation within {{the history of the}} so-called Weimar Republic (Deutsches Reich) is to declare this devastating event as one of the stepping stones to establish Hitler’s Nazi Regime. However, there is little in law and economics literature to explain the colossal acceleration of the <b>creeping</b> <b>inflation</b> in the very short time from July to November 1923 to a massive hyperinflation. This research rejects the standard argument that the sole cause of the German Hyperinflation was neither the lack of sufficient taxation, the high amount of war bonds issued during WWI, the reparation payments which had to be made after the war by the new German Government, nor the social unrest in addition to the political instability at that time. The termination of the German Hyperinflation was accomplished by legal measures through German Supreme Court judgements as well as through the Parliamentarian calculation of the conversion rate Mark to Reichsmark on the basis of valorism and not nominalism, which was not completely fair enough to everyone but an optimal solution under current socio-economic conditions. In addition monetary measures such as those which were instigated by the German Reserve Bank through the implementation of the Rentenmark, a new currency backed by state land properties to re-establish trust, may be an example of how to deal with future hyperinflations in developed and developing countries. Nevertheless the immense acceleration process in hyperinflations still remains unclear and unpredictable. The transformation of an inflationary development into the hyperinflation as a very complex phenomenon, which was undertaken to some extent in this research, could be a further advanced research avenue of the complexity economics in conjunction with research areas like mass hysteria, bandwagon effect, social brain and mirror neurons...|$|E
