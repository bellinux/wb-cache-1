A water extraction test in 2016 by Honeybee Robotics used asteroid regolith simulant developed by Deep Space Industries and the University of Central Florida {{to match the}} bulk mineralogy of a particular <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>meteorite.</b> Although the simulant was physically dry (i.e., it contained no water molecules adsorbed in the matrix of the rocky material), heating to about 510 °C released hydroxyl, which came out as substantial amounts of water vapor from the molecular structure of phyllosilicate clays and sulphur compounds. The vapor was condensed into liquid water filling the collection containers, demonstrating the feasibility of mining water from certain classes of physically dry asteroids.|$|E

A <b>Carbonaceous</b> <b>Meteorite</b> {{which was}} found in Hungary in 1857, which was examined by Friedrich Wöhler {{was found to have}} organic compounds which he believed were Extraterrestrial in origin. The book moves on to Marcellin Berthelot who in 1864 claimed to have found [...] "petroleum-like hydrocarbons" [...] in a meteorite found near Orgueil. Louis Pasteur also ran experiments on this meteor and concluded it was sterile and not capable of generating life. The discovery of the Murchison meteorite also led to the finding of 70 amino acids most of which are not native to earth's biosphere. The authors look into the work done on samples brought back from the Apollo program missions. Geoffrey Eglinton one of the authors had been given a sample and although he knew there had never been life on the moon they had hoped to find organic compounds. None were found within those samples, which led to disappointment. These findings led the authors to speculate on the possibility of answering the question of whether there has ever been life on Mars and if future missions will bring back viable samples for testing.|$|E

Both comets and <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>meteorites</b> are implicated as sources for the earth's atmophilic and organogenic elements. A mass balance argument involving the estimated ratios of hydrogen to carbon in <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>meteorites,</b> comets, and the crust and upper mantle suggests that comets supplied the earth with a large fraction of its volatiles. The probability that comets {{contributed significantly to the}} earth's volatile inventory suggests a chemical evolutionary link between comets, prebiotic organic synthesis, and the origin of life...|$|R

In the fines from the sampling site, the contribution of material similar to type 1 <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>meteorites</b> is insignificant, either because it never existed, or because it was evaporated or comminuted by impact or was diluted by indigenous material.

The 'missing carbon' in comets is explained as residing predominantly in the approximately 20 percent fraction of the comets consisting of the complex organic component of interstellar dust.

50|$|As a young {{professor}} at UC Davis, Deamer {{continued to work}} with electron microscopy, revealing {{for the first time}} particles related to functional ATPase enzymes within the membranes of sarcoplasmic reticulum. After spending sabbaticals in England at the University of Bristol in 1971 and with Alec Bangham in 1975, Deamer became interested in liposomes. Conversations with Bangham inspired his research on the role of membranes in the origin of life, and in 1985 Deamer demonstrated that the Murchison <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>meteorite</b> contained lipid-like compounds that could assemble into membranous vesicles. Deamer described he significance of self-assembly processes in his 2011 book First Life. In collaborative work with Mark Akeson, a post-doctoral student at the time, the two established methods for monitoring proton permeation through ion channels such as gramicidin. In 1989, while returning from a scientific meeting in Oregon, Deamer conceived that {{it might be possible to}} sequence single molecules of DNA by using an imposed voltage to pull them individually through a nanoscopic channel. The DNA sequence could be distinguished by the specific modulating effect of the four bases on the ionic current through the channel. In 1993, he and Dan Branton initiated a research collaboration with John Kasianowitz at NIST to explore this possibility with the hemolysin channel, and in 1996 published the first paper demonstrating that nanopore sequencing may be feasible. George Church at Harvard had independently proposed a similar idea, and Church, Branton and Deamer decided to initiate a patent application which was awarded in 1998. Mark Akeson joined the research effort in 1997, and in 1999 published a paper showing that the hemolysin channel, now referred to as a nanopore, could distinguish between purine and pyrimidine bases in single RNA molecules. In 2007, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) licensed the patents describing the technology and in 2014 released the MinION nanopore sequencing device to selected researchers. The first publications appeared in 2015, one of which used the MinION to sequence E. coli DNA with 99.4% accuracy relative to the established 5.4 million base pair genome. Despite earlier skepticism, nanopore sequencing is now accepted as a viable third generation sequencing method. The original 1996 paper has been cited over 2000 times in the scientific literature, and in 2017, twenty one years later, a Google search for nanopore sequencing returned 226,000 results.|$|E

40|$|Meteorites are {{extraterrestrial}} {{objects that}} survive the {{passage through the}} Earth’s atmosphere and impact the Earth's surface. They {{can be divided into}} several classes, the carbonaceous chondrites being one of them. Carbonaceous chondrites are the oldest and best preserved meteorites and contain a record of the birth of the solar system. They are rich in carbon, containing up to 3 wt% of organic carbon. Carbonaceous chondrites have a rich organic inventory that includes, among others, amino acids, carboxylic acids, and nucleobases. Some of the organic compounds present in <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>meteorites</b> are important in terrestrial biochemistry. It is suggested that <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>meteorites</b> may have exogenously delivered extraterrestrial organic molecules to the early Earth, therefore contributing with the first prebiotic building blocks of life. The research described in this thesis focuses on the analysis of extraterrestrial organic compounds present in <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>meteorites.</b> The performed experiments seek to provide an important contribution to understand the formation and evolution of these compounds. Furthermore, the use of complementary analytical techniques allow us to gain information about extraterrestrial delivery processes of organic molecules to Earth, subsequent incorporation into the carbonaceous material available on the young Earth, and their possible importance for the origin and evolution of life on our planet and possibly elsewhere.

40|$|Evidence for {{indigenous}} microfossils in <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>meteorites</b> {{suggests that the}} paradigm of the endogenous origin of life on Earth should be reconsidered. It is now widely accepted that comets and <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>meteorites</b> {{played an important role}} in the delivery of water, organics and life critical biogenic elements to the early Earth and facilitated the origin and evolution of the Earth's Biosphere. However; the detection of embedded microfossils and mats in <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>meteorites</b> implies that comets and meteorites may have played a direct role in the delivery of intact microorganisms and that the Biosphere may extend far into the Cosmos. Recent space observations have found the nuclei of comets to have very low albedos (approx. 0. 03) and. these jet-black surfaces become very hot (T approx. 400 K) near perihelion. This paper reviews recent observational data-on comets and suggests that liquid water pools could exist in cavities and fissures between the internal ices and rocks and the exterior carbonaceous crust. The presence of light and liquid water near the surface of the nucleus enhances the possibility that comets could harbor prokaryotic extremophiles (e. g., cyanobacteria) capable of growth over a wide range of temperatures. The hypothesis that comets are the parent bodies of the CI 1 and the CM 2 <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>meteorites</b> is advanced. Electron microscopy images will be presented showing forms interpreted as indigenous-microfossils embedded' in freshly. fractured interior surfaces of the Orgueil (CI 1) and Murchison (CM 2) meteorites. These forms are consistent in size and morphologies with known morphotypes of all five orders of Cyanobacteriaceae: Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) elemental data shows that the meteoritic forms have anomalous C/O; C/N; and C/S as compared with modern extremophiles and cyanobacteria. These images and spectral data indicate that the clearly biogenic and embedded remains cannot be interpreted as recent biological contaminants and'therefore are indigenous'microfossils in the meteorites...|$|R
40|$|The {{chirality}} {{of organic}} molecules with the asymmetric location of group radicals {{was discovered in}} 1848 by Louis Pasteur during his investigations of {{the rotation of the}} plane of polarization of light by crystals of sodium ammonium paratartrate. It is well established that the amino acids in proteins are exclusively Levorotary (L-aminos) and the sugars in DNA and RNA are Dextrorotary (D-sugars). This phenomenon of homochirality of biological polymers is a fundamental property of all life known on Earth. Furthermore, abiotic production mechanisms typically yield recemic mixtures (i. e. equal amounts of the two enantiomers). When amino acids were first detected in <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>meteorites,</b> it was concluded that they were racemates. This conclusion was taken as evidence that they were extraterrestrial and produced by abiologically. Subsequent studies by numerous researchers have revealed that many of the amino acids in <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>meteorites</b> exhibit a significant L-excess. The observed chirality is much greater than that produced by any currently known abiotic processes (e. g. Linearly polarized light from neutron stars; Circularly polarized ultraviolet light from faint stars; optically active quartz powders; inclusion polymerization in clay minerals; Vester-Ulbricht hypothesis of parity violations, etc.). This paper compares the measured chirality detected in the amino acids of <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>meteorites</b> with the effect of these diverse abiotic processes. IT is concluded that the levels observed are inconsistent with post-arrival biological contamination or with any of the currently known abiotic production mechanisms. However, they are consistent with ancient biological processes on the meteorite parent body. This paper will consider these chiral biomarkers in view of the detection of possible microfossils found in the Orgueil and Murchison <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>meteorites.</b> Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) data obtained on these morphological biomarkers will be presented to show that the elemental compositions of these morphological biomarkers are not consistent with the compositions expected for modern (i. e. post-arrival) biological contaminants...|$|R
