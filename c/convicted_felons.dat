5|$|In July 2010, Minnesota Majority, a {{conservative}} watchdog group, {{conducted a study}} in which they flagged 2,803 voters for examination, including some 1,359 they suspected were ineligible <b>convicted</b> <b>felons</b> in the largely Democratic Minneapolis–St. Paul area who voted illegally in the Senate race. Subsequent investigations of Minnesota Majority's claims by election officials found that many of their allegations were incorrect.|$|E
5|$|To become {{governor}} of Ohio, a candidate {{must be a}} qualified elector in the state. This means that any candidate for governor {{must be at least}} 18 {{years old at the time}} of his/her election, a resident of Ohio for at least 30 days before the election, and a U.S. citizen. <b>Convicted</b> <b>felons</b> and those deemed by the courts as incompetent to vote are not eligible.|$|E
5|$|During the {{petition}} drive, groups supporting Morse accused the firm collecting the signatures of hiring <b>convicted</b> <b>felons</b> and gathering personal information. Recall backers said that Morse's group was misleading the public. In addition, the recall drives brought in support from national groups {{on both sides}} of the issue. The National Rifle Association (NRA) supported the recall effort with mailers and donations. National groups opposing the recall included America Votes, believed to be financially supported by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, as well as California billionaire Eli Broad.|$|E

5|$|Arthur Andersen {{was charged}} with and found guilty of {{obstruction}} of justice for shredding the thousands of documents and deleting e-mails and company files that tied the firm to its audit of Enron. Although {{only a small number of}} Arthur Andersen's employees were involved with the scandal, the firm was effectively put out of business; the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from <b>convicted</b> <b>felons.</b> The company surrendered its CPA license on August 31, 2002, and 85,000 employees lost their jobs. The conviction was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court due to the jury not being properly instructed on the charge against Andersen. The Supreme Court ruling theoretically left Andersen free to resume operations. However, the damage to the Andersen name has been so great that it has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale.|$|E

25|$|In Haynes v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that, because <b>convicted</b> <b>felons</b> are {{prohibited}} from owning firearms, requiring felons to register any firearms they owned constituted a form of self-incrimination and was therefore unconstitutional.|$|E

25|$|On December 15, 2009, Abbate {{was officially}} {{fired from the}} CPD after a {{mandatory}} review by the Chicago Civilian Police Board. The firing was a formality, as the CPD does not allow <b>convicted</b> <b>felons</b> {{to serve on the}} force.|$|E
25|$|Considering Kroupa and Fancher's {{backgrounds}} {{and the fact}} that MindVox employed a motley collection of <b>convicted</b> <b>felons</b> like security expert Len Rose and the infamous Phiber Optik (Mark Abene) who was awaiting a Manhattan grand jury indictment, these were very real issues at the time.|$|E

25|$|In December 2009, a Chicago Tribune story {{reported}} on the problem facing eastern sections of Uptown where several nursing homes clustered in the area house the mentally ill, including felons. Many of these residents have committed a variety of serious crimes including murder, and 11 nursing homes in the area house 318 <b>convicted</b> <b>felons</b> and 1350 mentally ill people.|$|E
25|$|Den forgyldte Krone, {{under the}} Dutchman Arent Henriksen, was sent {{in advance to}} test the waters, but {{returned}} after waiting in vain for Dyppel. Dyppel's vessel Færøe had departed on October 20, 1671 and did not arrive until May 23 the following year. This delay {{was caused by a}} leak incurred in November 1671, and subsequent docking in Bergen for 3 months, during which time Dyppel had quite a task with controlling the crew which consisted partly of indentured servants and partly of <b>convicted</b> <b>felons</b> conscripted for duty.|$|E
25|$|The Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA), Pub. L 90-618 and {{subsequent}} amendments established a detailed Federal scheme governing {{the distribution of}} firearms. The GCA prohibited firearms ownership by certain broad categories of individuals thought to {{pose a threat to}} public safety: <b>convicted</b> <b>felons,</b> convicted misdemeanor domestic violence or stalking offenders, persons with an outstanding felony warrant, fugitives from justice, unlawful aliens, persons with court-mandated protective orders issued against them, persons who have been involuntarily committed to a mental health facility, adjudicated mentally ill by a court, and others.|$|E

25|$|Both Monserrate and Espada faced {{accusations of}} {{unethical}} or criminal conduct. Monserrate was indicted for felony assault in March {{and would have}} automatically lost his seat if convicted. New York, like most states, has a provision in its state constitution which bars <b>convicted</b> <b>felons</b> from holding office. (Monseratte would be acquitted of the felonies, but was convicted on misdemeanors.) Espada {{was the target of}} a state investigation into whether he funded his campaign with money siphoned from a nonprofit health care agency he controls. The Bronx County District Attorney's office was also investigating charges that Espada actually resided in Mamaroneck, Westchester County rather than the north Bronx district he represented.|$|E
25|$|After {{years of}} living {{on the wrong side}} of the law, Simon Templar has been pardoned for past (perceived) crimes and is now working as an agent of Scotland Yard. His first mission is to {{investigate}} a crime ring called the Angels of Doom, which specializes in (among other things) helping <b>convicted</b> <b>felons</b> escape police dragnets and ambushes. The Angels of Doom is run by Jill Trelawney, a young woman who is willing to condone just about any action—including the murder of The Saint, if needs be—in her quest to wreak havoc on Scotland Yard, which she blames for the death of her father. But Templar, in his pursuit of Trelawney, finds within her an unexpected kindred spirit.|$|E
25|$|At that time, NA {{was not yet}} {{recognized}} by society at large as a positive force. The initial group had difficulty finding places {{that would allow them}} to meet, and often had to meet in people's homes. The first meetings of Narcotics Anonymous were held in the basements of churches for the members protection because at that time an old law prohibiting <b>convicted</b> <b>felons</b> from congregating was still being upheld and churches offered their basements as a sanctuary. Addicts would have to cruise around meeting places and check for surveillance, to make sure meetings would not be busted by police. It was many years before NA became recognized as a beneficial organization, although some early press accounts were very positive.|$|E

25|$|In 1922, he {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} come to the United States and work under Adolf Meyer at the Phipps Psychiatric Clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. He became a United States citizen and married the sculptress Florence Hesketh in 1927. He moved to New York City in 1932 to accept a senior staff position at the Bellevue Mental Hygiene Clinic, the psychiatric clinic connected with the New York Court of General Sessions in which all <b>convicted</b> <b>felons</b> received a psychiatric examination that was used in court. In 1935 he testified for the defense in the trial of Albert Fish, declaring him insane. In 1946, Wertham opened the Lafargue Clinic in the basement of St. Philip's Church in Harlem, a low-cost psychiatric clinic specializing in black teenagers. The clinic was financed by voluntary contributions.|$|E

500|$|The second Article of the Constitution {{sets out}} the {{procedures}} and mechanisms for voting, elections and holding office. Pursuant to Section 1, any Virginia resident over age 18 may vote in state elections; the voting age was reduced from 21 by a 1972 {{amendment to the}} federal constitution. [...] However, § 1 denies the vote {{to people who have}} been determined to be mentally incompetent or anyone convicted of a felony. Disfranchising <b>convicted</b> <b>felons</b> {{has been found to be}} consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The General Assembly, pursuant to §4, is given wide power to regulate the time place and manner of all elections.|$|E
