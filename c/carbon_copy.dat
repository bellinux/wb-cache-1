5|$|Reynolds and Reynolds {{was founded}} by Lucius Reynolds and his brother-in-law, James Gardner, in June 1866 in Dayton, Ohio. It was a small {{printing}} shop founded with $500 in capital and originally named Reynolds and Gardner. It made standardized business documents using <b>carbon</b> <b>copy</b> paper. A year after Reynolds was founded, James sold {{his interest in the}} company to co-founder Lucius' father, Ira Reynolds, and the company was renamed to its current namesake, Reynolds and Reynolds. Co-owners Ira and Lucius died in 1880 and 1913 respectively. The youngest of the Reynolds family, Edwin Stanton Reynolds, took over.|$|E
5|$|Arrington {{completed}} much of {{the research}} for Great Basin Kingdom in the LDS Church library archives. Aware of the LDS Church Archives's hostility to academic research at the time, Arrington took John A. Widtsoe's advice and started his research with published materials and theses, working up to unpublished materials. Arrington was able to circumvent A. William Lund's policy of personally approving all notes taken in the archives: Arrington took his notes on a typewriter using <b>carbon</b> <b>copy</b> paper, enabling him to leave a copy with Lund and take his own copy home. In order to rewrite his dissertation into Great Basin Kingdom, Arrington took a sabbatical 1956–1957 and was granted a fellowship at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California.|$|E
5|$|In early April 2009, a <b>carbon</b> <b>copy</b> of {{one version}} of the list was {{discovered}} at the State Library of New South Wales by workers combing through boxes of materials collected by author Thomas Keneally. The 13-page document, yellow and fragile, was filed among research notes and original newspaper clippings. The document was given to Keneally in 1980 by Pfefferberg when he was persuading him to write Schindler's story. This version of the list contains 801 names and is dated 18 April 1945; Pfefferberg is listed as worker number 173. Several authentic versions of the list exist, because the names were re-typed several times as conditions changed in the hectic days {{at the end of}} the war.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>carbon</b> <b>copies</b> {{declined}} {{with the}} advent of photocopying and electronic document creation and distribution (word processing). <b>Carbon</b> <b>copies</b> are still sometimes used in special applications: for example, in manual receipt books which have a multiple-use sheet of carbon paper supplied, so that the user can keep an exact copy of each receipt issued, although even here carbonless copy paper is often used to the same effect.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} typed {{report was}} seven pages long. It was retyped, {{with a number}} of <b>carbon</b> <b>copies</b> being made for distribution. No specimen of the original translation is known, and the German version held by the Imperial War Museum is one of the <b>carbon</b> <b>copies</b> and lacks the sketches that were apparently included in Mayer's original. A typed copy in German can also be found in the Public Record Office, while the report has been published twice in English translation.|$|R
5|$|Denzel Washington is an American {{actor who}} made his feature film debut in <b>Carbon</b> <b>Copy</b> (1981). In 1982, Washington made his first {{appearance}} in the medical drama St. Elsewhere as Dr. Philip Chandler. The role {{proved to be the}} breakthrough in his career. He starred as Private First Class Melvin Peterson in the drama A Soldier's Story (1984). The film was an adaptation of the Off-Broadway play A Soldier's Play (1981–1983) in which Washington had earlier portrayed the same character. In 1987, he played Steve Biko, an anti-apartheid activist in the Richard Attenborough-directed drama Cry Freedom, for which he received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Two years later, Washington won the award for playing Trip, a former slave-turned-soldier in Civil War film Glory (1989). In 1990, he played the title character in the play The Tragedy of Richard III, and starred in Spike Lee's comedy-drama Mo' Better Blues. Washington received the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the Berlin International Film Festival, for playing the eponymous civil rights activist in Lee's Malcolm X (1992).|$|E
5|$|Freedom from Want was {{published}} with an essay by Carlos Bulosan {{as part of}} the Four Freedoms series. Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic socioeconomic hardships rather than sociopolitical hardships abroad, and it thrust him into prominence. As he neared his thirtieth birthday, the Philippine immigrant and labor organizer Bulosan was experiencing a life that was not consistent with the theme Rockwell depicted in his version of Freedom From Want. Unknown as a writer, he was subsisting as a migrant laborer working intermittent jobs. Post editors tracked down the impoverished immigrant to request an essay contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the Commonwealth of the Philippines, a United States territory, was occupied by Japan. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked his introduction, and his name was thereafter well recognized. The essay was lost by The Post, and Bulosan, who had no <b>carbon</b> <b>copy,</b> had to track down the only draft of the essay at a bar in Tacoma.|$|E

25|$|In the past, these medical reports {{consisted}} of very abbreviated handwritten notes that were {{added in the}} patient's file for interpretation by the primary physician responsible for the treatment. Ultimately, this mess of handwritten notes and typed reports were consolidated into a single patient file and physically stored along with thousands of other patient records in a wall of filing cabinets in the medical records department. Whenever the need arose to review the records of a specific patient, the patient's file would be retrieved from the filing cabinet and delivered to the requesting physician. To enhance this manual process, many medical record documents were produced in duplicate or triplicate by means of <b>carbon</b> <b>copy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Castro, a {{qualified}} lawyer, used {{his time in}} prison to prepare a speech entitled History Will Absolve Me, which he learned by heart. A <b>carbon</b> <b>copy</b> of the speech was smuggled page by page out of court by the stenographer, who leaked it to a friend from July 26 attack, Haydée Santamaría, and later published it. Two years later, in 1955, a group of prisoners' mothers launched a campaign to free Castro and the other rebels imprisoned with him. As popular support for the rebels and opposition to Batista's rule mounted, a group of political leaders, editors, and intellectuals signed a public appeal demanding liberty for the political prisoners". That year, the Cuban Congress passed a bill granting general amnesty to political prisoners. After being signed by Batista, the thirty imprisoned rebels were freed. They served 22 months in prison.|$|E
25|$|It was {{announced}} in July 2009 that the Belgian dredging company Jan De Nul, together with a consortium of contractors consisting of the Spanish Sacyr Vallehermoso, the Italian Impregilo, and the Panamanian company Grupo Cusa, had been awarded the contract to build the six new locks for US$3.1 billion, which was one billion less than the next highest competing bid due to having a concrete budget 71% percent smaller {{than that of the}} next bidder and allotted roughly 25% less for steel to reinforce that concrete. The contract resulted in $100 million in dredging works {{over the next few years}} for the Belgian company and a great deal of work for its construction division. The design of the locks is a <b>carbon</b> <b>copy</b> of the Berendrecht Lock, which is 68 m wide and 500 m long, making it the largest lock in the world.

25|$|Afterwards, {{during the}} off-season, Luc Robitaille {{turned down a}} one-year deal with a {{substantial}} pay cut and ended up signing with Detroit, as the Red Wings represented his best chance at winning the Stanley Cup, and like Tomas Sandstrom before him in 1997, Robitaille won the Stanley Cup with Detroit in 2002. The Kings started off {{the season with a}} sluggish October and November, and then found their game again to finish with 95 points. They in fact were tied in points with the second place Phoenix Coyotes, and only finished third in the Pacific Division and seventh in the West due to a goals-for differential—the Coyotes having 228 and the Kings having 214 as a team. In the playoffs they met the Colorado Avalanche once again, this time in the first round. The series would prove to be a <b>carbon</b> <b>copy</b> of their previous meeting, with the Kings behind three games to one and bouncing back to tie the series, only to be dominated in the seventh game and eliminated.
