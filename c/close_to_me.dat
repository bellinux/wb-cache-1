I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E
25|$|I {{believe that}} it is one of my strong collaborations. It already has me worried about the future. This is my best moment now, as far as the match I have musically with Sakis. Without wanting to put down all the people I have collaborated with I adore them like, ex, Giorgos Mazonakis. The people who go to see Sakis musically are very <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> in {{relation}} to those who go to see a laïko artist. The track was recorded sometime in late November at Kontopoulos' studio, coinciding with the artists' busy rehearsal schedule for The S Club. Before its release, Tamta had not heard the final result as Kontopoulos and Rouvas were in the studio up until the song's release working on the finishing touches.|$|E
500|$|It {{is a great}} {{outlet for}} me to go into the studio and write a song like 'Petals', which is one of my most {{personal}} songs and remains one of my favorites. I think [...] honest lyrics I've ever written. The song chronicles a lot of past emotions I've felt to certain people <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and the way I feel towards them and how their actions have impacted me personally. For that reason, I sang in my lower registers, trying to add that breathy effect to go {{hand in hand with the}} song's composition.|$|E

500|$|It surpassed {{anything}} that I ever thought. [...] I didn't {{ever think that}} I {{should be in the}} cathedral with the Queen and all the dignitaries that were there. [...] And the singing, the organ, the Queen, just everything and everybody. [...] It's really been out of this world. [...] Just to hear Zadok the Priest, I think, has lifted me to Cloud Nine, because it's something that I love. [...] And to hear that and to have the Queen pass so <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] And yes, she smiled. [...] She smiled at me.|$|E
500|$|Rivette {{worked with}} scriptwriters Pascal Bonitzer and Christine Laurent using an {{automatic}} writing approach that involved writing the script day by day; {{the actors and}} filmmakers {{did not know the}} direction of the story in advance of each day's filming. Eurimages provided €420,000 of funding in July 2002, and the film was shot that autumn and winter. Rivette immediately thought of Béart, who starred in La Belle Noiseuse, to play the carnal Marie. Béart has said that [...] "Of all the films I've made, this was the one which most disturbed people very <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> They said: 'It's almost as though the Emmanuelle we know was up there on the screen.'." [...] Béart's image in the media at the time was characterised by the near hysteria seen when she appeared naked on the cover of Elle in May 2003 after filming ended.|$|E
500|$|Co-showrunner Wyman {{also served}} as episode director, marking his {{television}} directorial debut. He noted his love of the experience, as it permitted him to grow closer with the series' actors and [...] "actually work with them on a level that [...] before and really get down there with them." [...] Wyman was originally supposed to direct several episodes the previous year and earlier in the season, but found he was too busy. He explained, [...] "Then an episode was coming up that we were thinking about writing and I really felt close to it. [...] The opportunity came up where somebody had fallen out and I felt {{that this is the}} perfect time because everything was completely under control. [...] It allowed me to go and do it. [...] It's an episode that's really <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] It's about love and it's about all the great things that we talk about on Fringe." ...|$|E

2500|$|Babel later recalled, [...] "My journalistic work {{gave me a}} lot, {{especially}} {{in the sense of}} material. I managed to amass an incredible number of facts, which proved to be an invaluable creative tool. I struck up friendships with morgue attendants, criminal investigators, and government clerks. Later, when I began writing fiction, I found myself always returning to these 'subjects', which were so <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> in order to put character types, situations, and everyday life into perspective.

Sun Ce said, [...] "Zhou Gongjin is an extraordinary hero and talent. He's very <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and we're like brothers.

2500|$|Fontcuberta {{wrote about}} this series: [...] "The {{idea was to}} invite friends and people <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to provide a sample of their blood... a piece of {{transparent}} film.... Immediately afterward, I make an enlargement on photographic paper using the blood as a negative...." [...] The photographs {{have been described as}} [...] "exploring identity through blood and its self-expression as abstract art." [...] A review of some photographs from the series stated that they caused the writer to [...] "imagine anonymous blood donors, laboratory procedures, and the possibility of AIDS, or cancer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Uncharted 2 also {{received}} praise from other developers. [...] producer Gordon Van Dyke stated [...] "Uncharted 2 is an amazing-looking game. But we're reaching {{that level of}} quality. It's {{going to be hard}} for any game to be able to make a claim that they look better... to even be <b>close,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> is quite an honour as a developer. The one thing I did was, when I looked at their game I was like, damn them! What have they done to the rest of us?

2500|$|In 2008, {{speaking}} to Kerrang!, Max Cavalera remembered: [...] "This certainly {{got in touch}} with the dark side of Sepultura. [...] "Refuse/Resist" [...] is an anti-police song – a real piece of anarchy. You could call the album riot music. It was full of heavy shit and some of it was risky, but it was just where we were coming from at the time. [...] "Manifest" [...] is also very <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> That's about a massacre of prisoners by police at a jail in São Paulo. One hundred and eleven prisoners were killed, and one of my friends was there and took pictures of it all, one of which we used in the artwork." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 1986, {{the trio}} reconvened to play three concerts for the Amnesty International A Conspiracy of Hope Tour. In July of that year, they reunited {{in the studio}} to record a new album. However, Copeland broke his {{collarbone}} in a fall from a horse {{and was unable to}} play the drums. As a result of the tense and short-lived reunion in the studio, [...] "Don't Stand So <b>Close</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> '86" [...] was released in October 1986 as their final single and made it into the UK Top 25; it also appeared on the 1986 compilation , which reached No. 1 in the UK album charts.

2500|$|Pierre {{has since}} looked back on Go with mixed emotions; he later cited {{it as his}} {{personal}} least favorite album by the band. He remembered the band were [...] "burnt out and miserable" [...] while recording, noting that drummer Thaxton left the band a year later due to depression. He personally was struggling with dark thoughts as well: [...] " [...] I was thinking about death a lot and {{had a lot of}} back pain and was grumpy and it was winter. [...] A {{lot of people who were}} <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> died around that time and I just felt this strange floating sensation like I was sleepwalking through life. It wasn't bad or good, it was just weird and I feel like that somehow translated to that record." ...|$|E

2500|$|August {{would also}} be a tough month for the other Rangers ace Cliff Lee, whose record for the month was 1–6. Lee was also accused by ESPN radio host Colin Cowherd {{claiming}} people close to Lee said he wanted to sign with the Yankees or another elite team, that Lee didn't care about Texas, and Cowherd also accused Lee of mailing it in against Baltimore on August 21, a game in which Lee gave up 8 runs. After the August 22 game Lee told reporters [...] "It's a lie. Write that. Are you writing? Write that it's a lie. I did not say that and nobody <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> would say that. Either say who the source is or shut up because I am saying it is not true." [...] Following the events in Baltimore Lee would lose his next two games before reporting that he was having muscle pain in his back and would receive an injection.|$|E
2500|$|On March 22, 2007 La Russa {{was arrested}} in Jupiter, Florida for {{suspicion}} of {{driving under the influence}} of alcohol. He was found asleep at the wheel of his running SUV with the car in park at a stop sign.

2500|$|Failures in {{both the}} East and the West began a tide of events that was to {{overwhelm}} Asquith's Liberal Government. Strategic setbacks combined with a shattering personal blow when, on 12 May 1915, Venetia Stanley announced her engagement to Edwin Montagu. Asquith's reply was immediate and brief, [...] "As you know well, this breaks my heart. I couldn't bear {{to come and see}} you. I can only pray God to bless you—and help me." [...] Venetia's importance to him is illustrated by a letter written in mid-1914; [...] "Keep <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> beloved in this most critical time of my life. I know you will not fail." [...] Her engagement; [...] "a very treacherous return after all the joy you've given me", left him devastated. Significant though the loss was personally, its impact on Asquith politically can be overstated. The historian Stephen Koss notes that Asquith [...] "was always able to divide his public and private lives into separate compartments (and) soon found new confidantes to whom he was writing with no less frequency, ardour and indiscretion." ...|$|E
