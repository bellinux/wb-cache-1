40|$|Currency option traders usually use the Black-Scholes {{model in}} which the {{exchange}} rate follows a lognormal process. However, {{it is found that}} exchange rates may follow a mean-reverting process instead, for example, certain currencies are constrained to move inside target zones or under a managed-floating regime. Different dynamical processes of exchange rates raise uncertainty on the choice of a pricing model for currency options. Such model risk would worsen the market condition when there is an adverse shock on the underlying <b>currency.</b> Financial <b>instability</b> could thus result, if pricing models are not chosen and used properly in the foreign exchange market. Barrier options have emerged as significant products for hedging and investment in the foreign exchange market since the late 1980 s, largely in the over-the-counter markets and for structuring financial products (e. g., currency-linked notes). The existence of a barrier option depends upon whether the underlying exchange rate has crossed a predetermined barrier prior to the exercise time. The estimated daily turnover of currency barrier option trading is about US$ 12 billion. This paper develops a barrier-option pricing {{model in which}} the exchange rate follows a mean-reverting lognormal process. The corresponding closed-form solutions for the barrier options with time-dependent barriers are derived. The mean-reverting lognormal process keeps the exchange rate in a range around the mean level. The numerical results show that the parameters of the mean-reverting lognormal process make the valuation of currency barrier options and their hedge parameters different from those obtained from the conventional Black-Scholes model. ...|$|R

The paper identifies episodes of financial turmoil using a financial stress index (FSI), and proposes an analytical framework {{to assess the}} impact of financial stress-in particular banking distress-on the real economy.

It argues that state managers have to manage the contradictions between the imperatives of accumulation and legitimation, and can do so through the politics of depoliticisation.

Considering Ukraine’s economic and political situation, the main causes of macroeconomic instability are systematized. Government-implemented approaches for overcoming the macroeconomic instability have been suggested. The article introduces an approach for minimizing the negative effects on businesses, based on the timely identification of macroeconomic risks in terms of internal and external management. The possible negative impacts in case the timely decisions are not implemented have been assessed...|$|E
40|$|Restrictions on {{international}} capital transactions and other payments are usually designed to limit volatile short-term capital flows (“hot money”) and stabilize the exchange rate. Their imposition, however, {{may have the}} opposite effect by inadvertently signaling the continuation of macroeconomic imbalances and inconsistent (“bad”) future policy (Bartolini and Drazen, 1997 a,b). This paper investigates these alternative hypotheses by testing the impact of restrictions {{on international}} capital flows and other payments controls on the likelihood of currency crises. We employ a comprehensive sample of 90 developing and emerging-market economies over the 1975 - 1997 period, identifying 160 currency crises. Restrictions on international capital flows, current accounts, and international payments {{are associated with a}} higher probability of the onset of a speculative attack on the currency. This finding is robust to alternative measures of liberalization on international payments and the exchange rate regime, controlling for macroeconomic determinants of <b>currency</b> <b>instability,</b> and taking into account instability emanating from the banking sector. There may be some individual exceptions but the weight of the evidence suggests that countries imposing capital restrictions are sending a “bad signal” to markets, in turn increasing the likelihood of a net capital outflow and a currency crisis. ...|$|E
40|$|The US dollar {{has been}} {{volatile}} and falling {{again and again}} in recent decades as well as recent years, and for many observers, {{it is going to be}} broken sooner or later. The central importance of the dollar is due to the fact that it is not just a currency for the US. Over half of all dollar bills in circulation are held outside of the US borders, and almost half of the US Treasury bonds are held as reserves by foreign central banks. The US dollar is supposed to be the anchor that stabilizes the global currency market. Instead, today it is a major source of instability. In the back ground, the US fiscal deficits have been running high again under Bush administration, once up to almost 3 % of US GDP. And current account deficit is set to about 7 % in 2005 and more volatility is widely expected. The situation is very challenging for the central banks of Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan and Singapore which collectively hold about US$ 2. 8 trillion worth of US Treasury bonds as part of their reserves. The moment that they reduce their purchases, the value of the dollar slips. Yet, the more they buy, the more they are exposed to a potential free fall of the US dollar. China has been blamed, not only by US congressmen who are understandably not very familiar with either the complicated currency issues or the domestic politics in any other country, but also many economists or business strategists. It was said that it was all because RMB did not reevaluate, as the source of this "global imbalance" and <b>currency</b> <b>instability.</b> How much revaluation of RMB would remove the US deficits of $ 700 billions, or at least the US-China trade deficits $ 200 billions (including Hong Kong) ? 500 % or 1000 %? Of cause no body asked for that kind of magnitude now. Normally smart people say 30 - 50 %, with the unsaid intention to blame-then-suggest again another 30 - 50 % after some initial moves, then the third, the fourth. This seems not really new phenomena at all. It has been all so familiar before and since the Nixon shock in early 70 s', and in 80 s' when there was the Plaza Accord. The convenient targets to blame were the gold standard, the Dutch Mark, the Japanese Yen. Now it is turn for Chinese reminbi. So the question is what are the real causes of the global imbalance and <b>currency</b> <b>instability?</b> In this short paper, we first take a look at what is really going on with the Chinese economy and trade balance, and then try to identify sources of the current imbalance, and then, as a concluding remark, think again the possibilities to reform the global currency system...|$|E
40|$|Researchers {{and economists}} clarify {{that the problem}} of {{inflation}} and the <b>currency</b> <b>instability</b> occurs today is due to the implementation of monetary system which is not based on valuable commodity or gold as the gold standard of the previous system. As a sequence to this, there has been a proposal to create a Bretton Woods II system by the World Bank President, Robert Zoelick, recently in 2010. The question is whether the return to gold currency is justifiable in order to ensure world economic stability. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the historical data of the inflation rate and world gold price in order to identify a more stable financial system. The study will provide evidence that the gold standard era is the most stable era thus justifies the return to gold currency. This study uses time series data for a key economic indicator i. e. inflation rate starting from year 1880 to 2008, divided into three phases of gold standard system; i. e. the full gold standard system (1880 - 1914) and the gold exchange standard system (1925 - 1931); the Bretton Woods system (1946 - 1972) and the fiat currency system (1973 - 2008), using regression model and CUSUM test. The results show that the rate of inflation and the value of world gold are much lower and more stable during the gold standard phases than the fiat money. This indicates that the move to return to gold currency is more apt in the bid to ensure global economic stability. However, mor...|$|E
