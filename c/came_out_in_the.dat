25|$|Whoever he was, Abu Muslim built {{a secret}} network of pro-Abbasid {{sentiment}} based among the mixed Arab and Iranian military officers along the Silk Road garrison cities.

These networks proved essential, as the officers garrisoned along the Silk Road had spent years fighting the ferocious Turkic tribes of Central Asia and were experienced and respected tacticians and warriors.|$|E

Makbula Manjoor started in the late years of the sixties, but most of her novels <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eighties and nineties. Kaler Mondira is one of her most notable work. Rahat Khan wrote novels about middle class city people, their joys and sorrows, love and separation.

25|$|Whatever is good, bad or {{indifferent}} about Streets of Fire, {{it had a}} {{huge impact}} on other filmmakers. The two movies that <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> years after that are completely saturated in the iconography of Streets of Fire are RoboCop and Se7en. Se7en’s taking place in another world. It’s not New York. It’s not Chicago. A world where it’s raining all the time. Always dark. Always night, just about. Those are two very successful movies that figured out how to do the stylization with the appropriate amount of gore that they hooked the audience. And I think that if we’d done more gore, our chances of hooking the audience would be greater.|$|E

25|$|In their Premier League {{return to}} St Mary's, Southampton hosted Wigan Athletic on 25 August. Despite boasting a few clear goalscoring {{opportunities}} in the first half, including an Adam Lallana shot which hit the crossbar, the Saints were unable to break the deadlock {{in the first period}} and the teams went into half time level. It was the visitors who <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second half firing however, as Franco Di Santo broke the deadlock six minutes after the break with a powerful shot from inside the area. With chances opening for both sides, Athletic put the game beyond the hosts in the last minute, when a defensive error gave Ivorian Arouna Koné the chance to end the game, leaving Southampton in the relegation zone.|$|E
25|$|Many British {{scholars}} {{were slow}} to accept the truth. Some of the routes mentioned by the work had {{seemed to have been}} subsequently borne out and excuses were made for the known errors. Further evidence of the falsity of The Description of Britain <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following years, however, until no serious effort could be made in defense of the document. Bertram had on several occasions adopted variant readings and hypotheses unknown before Camden. The final confirmation that the Description was spurious came in the 1860s. Over four articles in 1866 and 1867, B.B.Woodward thoroughly debunked the work and, in 1869, J.E.B. Mayor complimented this by thoroughly comparing the Description with the Historial Mirror written by the real Richard of Cirencester (his only surviving work), which he had been reviewing and editing for the Rolls Series. Blame fell hardest on the reputation of William Stukeley, although it also impugned Gibbon, Roy, and other scholars who had accepted it.|$|E
25|$|LSU scored first {{early in}} the first quarter on a two-yard run by Brodnax, which was {{followed}} by a Kentucky touchdown late in the same quarter. Dietzel sent in the Chinese Bandits to start the second quarter. The Bandits wore down the Wildcats offense and did not allow a score {{for the rest of the}} half. On offense, Billy Hendrix scored on a 19-yard pass from Rabb to give LSU a 13–0 halftime lead. LSU <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second half determined to put the game away. Cannon ran for a 19-yard touchdown and kicked the extra point to start the third quarter, followed by a five-yard touchdown pass from Matherne to Norwood. The only score in the fourth quarter was Cannon's second touchdown on a two-yard run up the middle. LSU dominated the game statistically. The Tigers converted 18 first downs and had 364 offensive yards, compared to the Wildcats' eight and 136. Kentucky was focused on stopping the LSU passing game, which had picked up steam over the last few games. Because of this, led by Cannon, the Tigers had a big night in the running game. The team gained 243 yards on the ground, with Cannon rushing for 108 of those on twelve carries. The win moved LSU up to third in the Coaches' Poll and Associated Press Poll.|$|E

25|$|Going {{into the}} new year, the rivalry widened on the January 1 episode of SmackDown. LayCool {{interfered}} in a match between James and Beth Phoenix and attacked James after; Phoenix responded by chasing away LayCool but giving the Glam Slam to James as well. The following week Phoenix defeated Layla but afterward LayCool assaulted her together until James saved Phoenix. On January 22's SmackDown, in an unusually long segment for the Divas, LayCool held a leaving party for James complete with a pig-shaped cake. Originally Maria came out to defend champion James, but James also appeared to answer LayCool. After a brawl broke out, Phoenix {{arrived on the scene}} appearing to come to their aid only to assist LayCool in attacking James and Maria. McCool hit James with the cake and poured punch over her. LayCool continued to deride James, with Layla dressing up in a fatsuit with a pig mask and losing to McCool in a faux match for the Women's Championship as Piggie James. LayCool's boasting would be their downfall at the Royal Rumble, however, when Layla <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Piggie James outfit. James used this to her advantage, when she attacked Layla which distracted McCool allowing her to be pinned in under a minute, losing the Women's Championship. On the February 12 episode of SmackDown, LayCool defeated James in a non-title handicap match made by SmackDown Consultant Vickie Guerrero, who had been accidentally humiliated by James backstage.|$|E
