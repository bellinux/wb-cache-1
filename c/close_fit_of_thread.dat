40|$|A variational four-dimensional {{analysis}} technique using quasi-geostrophic {{models as}} constraints is examined using gridded fields as data. The analysis method uses a standard iterative nonlinear minimization technique {{to find the}} solution to the constraining forecast model which best fits the data as measured by a predefined functional.

Verification by comparisons to a few subjectively selected data sets is no longer justifiable because comput-ers have made statistical comparisons to the complete existing data bank easy. However, statistics based on the data bank are insufficient. There are three fur-ther criteria: (1) After optimizing its coefficients, the model should be capable <b>of</b> providing <b>close</b> <b>fits</b> <b>of</b> the individual test data covering {{a broad range of}} times, ages, humidities, thicknesses, etc.; (2) the model should have a rational, physi-cally justified theoretical basis, and (3) should allow good and easy extrapolation of the short-time tests into long times, high ages, large thicknesses etc. The last criterion is very important because good long-time predictions can be achieved only through updating based on short-time data for the given particular concrete. Various aspects of the B 3 and GZ models recently considered by ACI Committee 209, as well as some aspects of the CEF-FIP model, are briefly analyzed in the light of these criteria, clarifying the way to move ahead. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With a {{ray-tracing}} {{procedure and}} variational data assimilation techniques, {{it is now}} possible to make direct use of radio occultation bending angles, rather than their derived temperature and moisture retrievals, in atmospheric data analysis and assimilation. This paper describes results obtained from including more than 800 GPS/MET bending angle profiles, available over an 11 -day period, 20 – 30 June 1995, into the National Centers for Environmental Prediction spectral statistical interpolation analyses. The methodology for assimilating the bending angles (including an impact parameter offset correction) is briefly summarized. Verified with 56 collocated radiosonde profiles, the assimilation of only GPS/MET bending angles improves the temperature and specific humidity analysis above 850 mbar. Even though the number of GPS/MET soundings is still far less than conventional data and operational satellite soundings, our results from two continuous 11 -day data assimilation cycles demonstrate a <b>closer</b> <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> both GPS/MET and conventional observations to the analyses between 850 and 200 hPa when the bending angles are incorporated.

40|$|Abstract: Recent {{studies of}} {{excessive}} multidecade deflections of prestressed segmentally erected box girders revealed that more accurate pre-dictions of the prestress loss due to steel relaxation {{are needed for}} the design of large-span creep-sensitive structures. In particular, the loss needs to be calculated as part of creep structural analysis, during which the strain of concrete to which the prestressing steel is bonded varies in each time step. The existing empirical formulas used in the EuropeanModel Code andAmerican practice, which are valid only for constant strain and constant temperature, are here generalized to arbitrarily variable strain and temperature, heeding obvious asymptotic restrictions and the fact that steel is a viscoplastic material whose constitutive principles are well known. The resulting formula is a memoryless nonlinear equation for the viscoplastic strain rate of steel {{as a function of the}} current stress, strain, and temperature. <b>Close</b> <b>fits</b> <b>of</b> all themain test data from the literature, including the available data on the effects of strain and temperature changes, are achieved.

First, {{configuration of the}} instruction set permits a much <b>closer</b> <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> the processor to the target applications, {{reducing the number of}} execution cycles required. Second, configuring the processor removes unneeded features, reducing power and area overhead.

The first improvement has been well-studied. Analysis of the second and third improvements requires detailed circuit and layout experiments, which is the primary focus of this paper. Starting from a range of existing available power saving options, this work explores the tradeoff and analyzes the results: the design priority tradeoff, the process technology impact, and implementing low-power configurable processor using commercial scaled-VDD cell libraries compatible with mainstream SOC practices. These real processor designs can achieve power dissipation approaching 20 µW/MHz at 0. 8 V and close to 10 µW/MHz at 0. 6 V, using production 0. 13 um libraries.

40|$|The {{search for}} a {{fundamental}} mechano-chemical process that results in net cell motion has led investigators to fit neutrophil tracking data to well described physical models in hopes of understanding the functional form of the driving force. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) equation for mean square displacement describes a locally persistent and globally random process and is often used {{as a starting point}} for analysis of neutrophil displacements. Based upon the apparently <b>close</b> <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> neutrophil tracking data to this equation and the nature of its derivation, biologists have inferred that the motor of the neutrophil is best represented as a random process.

These correlations reflect a bimodal rather than a uniform distribution of subpath correlations in the two variables, and are strongly sampling rate-dependent. Significant periodic components of neutrophil shape change are also detected at the same time scale using either Fourier or elliptical Fourier transform-based descriptors of the neutrophil perimeter. Oscillations in neutrophil velocity have the same period. Taken together, these data suggest a nonstochastic, and perhaps periodic, component to the process driving neutrophil movement...|$|R

The Child Abuse Potential Inventory: Manual (2 nd ed.). DeKalb, IL: Psytec. Inc. ] can be confirmed with data from a group of Chinese mothers in Hong Kong. Method: Eight hundred and ninety-seven mothers from 13 child care centers in Hong Kong successfully completed a set of structured questionnaires consisting, among others, of the 77 -item Abuse Scale of the CAP Inventory. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to determine whether the data fits the factorial structure of the CAP Inventory identified by Milner (1986). Results: The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) of the model (εa) is 0. 031, indicating a <b>close</b> <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> the model in relation to the degrees of freedom. On testing the <b>close</b> <b>fit</b> against the null hypothesis that Ho: εa ≤ 0. 05, the associated p-value is almost one. This suggests that the probability that Ho is true is extremely high. The estimated expected value of the cross-validation index (ECVI) is 6. 185, which is less than the ECVIsat (6. 703), giving another indication on the fitness of the model. Other fit indices also provide support for the model fitness. Conclusion: The original six-factor structure of the CAP Inventory tested by CFA is acceptable.

This relation coincides with the prediction of chronometric cosmology, which estimates R as 160 +/- 40 Mpc (1 parsec = 3. 09 x 10 (16) m) from the proper motion to redshift relation of superluminal sources. Tangential aspects, including statistical methodology, fundamental physical theory, bright cluster galaxy samples, and proposed luminosity evolution, are briefly considered...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- Polynomial {{functions}} of age of different orders were evaluated in the modeling {{of the average}} growth trajectory in Santa Ines sheep in random regression models. Initially, the analyses were performed not considering the animal effect. Subsequently, the random regression analyses were performed including the random effects of the animal and its mother (genetic and permanent environment). The linear fit was lower, and the other orders were similar until near 100 days of age. The cubic function provided the <b>closest</b> <b>fit</b> <b>of</b> the observed averages, mainly {{at the end of}} the curve. Orders superior to this one tended to present incoherent behavior with the observed weights. The estimated direct heritabilities, considering the linear fit, were higher to those estimated by considering other functions. The changes in animal ranking based on predicted breeding values using linear fit and superior orders were small; however, the difference in magnitude of the predicted breeding values was higher, reaching values 77 % higher than those obtained with the cubic function. The cubic polynomial function is efficient in describing the average growth curve.
