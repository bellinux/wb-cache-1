25|$|Russian writer Yakov I. Perelman {{pointed out}} in Physics <b>Can</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Fun</b> (1913) that from a {{scientific}} point of view, a man made invisible by Griffin's method should have been blind, since a human eye works by absorbing incoming light, not letting it through completely. Wells seems to show some awareness of this problem in Chapter 20, where the eyes of an otherwise invisible cat retain visible retinas. Nonetheless, this would be insufficient, since the retina would be flooded with light (from all directions) that ordinarily is blocked by the opaque sclera of the eyeball. Also, any image would be badly blurred if the eye had an invisible cornea and lens.|$|E
500|$|... "Market Forces" [...] {{originally}} {{broadcast on}} March 26, 2008, on the Kids WB! block for the CW Network, at 10:00 a.m. It received generally positive reviews from television critics. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8.5 out of 10 and wrote [...] "Sometimes change <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun,</b> and this episode {{was a great}} example of that." [...] Goldman enjoyed the design of Shocker which he felt stayed true to his original design and was [...] "intrigued" [...] by changing his secret identity. He praised the usage of CGI, the portrayal of Peter's life, and the [...] "cool" [...] ending.|$|E

The Simlish version {{was used in}} the Sims expansion pack [...] soundtrack, and Allen also had her own character in the game. She declared: [...] "Recording 'Smile' was a great experience for me. Sometimes revenge <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun.</b> But getting to sing it again [...] came very naturally and it was hilarious to practice! The silly language and whimsy of The Sims games are a perfect fit for the song. I was laughing the entire time!" [...] Also, an animated music video was made for the Simlish version.|$|E

[...] What they really need is {{for someone to come}} along and prove that heart transplants <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun.</b> It's a job for comedy cardiac specialist Percy Durant (guest star Ade Edmondson), who we last saw working out in Ghana with consultant Ric. You could easily imagine Percy driving around in a van with a big, red, plastic heart on top of it, or cracking open someone's chest and pulling out a bunch of flowers. And when it comes to Lisa (Luisa Bradshaw-White), he magically comes up with the answer to all her problems.|$|E

Later, Liz's assistant Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden) announces that her wedding is back on and that Liz and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) need to plan a bachelorette party for her. Liz decides to have the party at her apartment and prove to her employees—who are invited—that she <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> to be with.

Liz gets upset about this, calls them out for not inviting her {{to hang out with}} them and demands that they apologize to her.|$|E
500|$|The game {{received}} generally negative reviews at release, garnering {{scores of}} 50% and 49/100 by aggregate sites GameRankings and Metacritic respectively. Computer and Video Games said [...] "Eorzea {{is a beautiful}} world with huge potential for vast adventures, but it's just a shame that this first voyage into {{it is such a}} mis-step". 1UP.com said that [...] "playing [...] is like playing with a toy stuck in a plastic bag: it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> for a while and you can get the general idea, but you can't appreciate the full experience", stating that future updates would likely rectify this issue. IGN said that [...] "Much of the promise of the combat system and depth of the crafting mechanics are drowned, unfortunately, under a sea of interface and performance issues that hinder the experience at nearly every step", further stating that while patches might improve the experience, its state {{at the time of the}} review made it [...] "not a world worth visiting". GameSpot, in addition to warning players away from the game, said that [...] "Final Fantasy XIV is a notable entry to the genre but only for what it lacks".|$|E

2500|$|Reception was {{not universally}} negative. Chris Carter of Destructoid gave a mediocre review. Although he criticized the waiting times and microtransactions, he commented that raiding other dungeons <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun.</b> Harry Slater of Pocket Gamer {{described}} {{the game as}} a [...] "well polished Clash of Clans clone", although he criticized the waiting times. Nathan Meunier of MacLife lauded the [...] "addictive" [...] construction and [...] "wacky" [...] humour, but criticized the frequency of in-app purchases. Slide to Play described the game as [...] "not too bad" [...] for a freemium game employing in-app purchases. Stephen Yuen of AndroidSPIN stated that the game needs patience, but praised the graphics and sound.|$|E
2500|$|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} critics. GameSpot awarded the game 5 out of 10 and said [...] "While the third-person shooter aspect of Harry's latest adventure <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun,</b> the game's story elements fail {{to live up}} to those of its literary namesake." [...] IGN gave the PS3 and Wii versions of the game an even lower score of 2 and the Xbox 360 version a 2.5, citing various gameplay issues, as well as the storyline being loosely related to the film and novel. Official Nintendo Magazine awarded the Wii version of the game 60% and called it [...] "An engaging attempt to apparate Harry into action gaming, but also a flawed one." [...] Game Informer awarded it 5.5 out of 10 and said [...] "Like a Quidditch player falling from a broomstick mid-match, this installment loses all forward momentum and goes plummeting toward a faceplant at top speed". VideoGamer.com awarded it 5 out of ten and said [...] "It's a impressively dark film tie-in, and an ambitious one at that, but don't expect anything more." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{characters}} of Fairy Tail have received both praise and criticism from publications dedicated to anime, manga, and other media. Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network describes the characters' styles {{as having a}} [...] "strong 'bite me' vibe" [...] and compared the visual style to that of One Piece author Eiichiro Oda. In his review of the second volume, Kimlinger said that Cancer's fighting style [...] "is a kick". In reviewing the first DVD/Blu-ray volume of Fairy Tail, Carlo Santos of Anime News Network says [...] "with a lead character as pumped-up as Natsu, it's hard not {{to get caught up}} in his energy". Santos also praises Happy, citing his character as an [...] "entertaining diversion, proving that animal sidekicks <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> to listen to and not just a necessary annoyance". In his reviews of the Blu-ray/DVDs, Neil Lumbard of DVD Talk mentions the [...] "strong likeability factor of each of the main characters". Anime News Network writer Rebecca Silverman, in her review of the 20th volume, said, [...] "Mashima still manages to get some action and laughs in as well, including one especially funny subplot involving Gajeel. Wendy takes over from Lucy as the primary female of the series for most of this volume, and how you feel about that will probably depend upon which character you prefer." [...] Silverman also thought that readers [...] "may have had mixed feelings about Jellal's return earlier in this arc, but the bond between him and Erza has been underlying their scenes for most of their page time together [...]" [...] However, she said that [...] "for the romantics in the audience, Jellal is still a criminal, and the government wants him. And so they come for him," [...] and pointed out that [...] "Erza fans and detractors will find it deepens her character a little while still finding it sad." ...|$|E
5000|$|It {{was just}} {{a sort of a}} summer vacation. It <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> to do in the sense there were some 'old pals' and it was {{possible}} to do because we didn't have to give rise to any new music. So in as much as the band was just playing repertoire material, there was kind of a 'ticket buy' in the idea of all those, you know, the entire cast of Dallas on stage at once, kind of thing. And {{there was some kind of}} attraction to that. But that was really all it was, I think. And I think I was probably an unnecessary spare part. So I didn't enjoy it terribly. But those gigs <b>can</b> <b>be</b> quite <b>fun</b> as performing in huge stadiums <b>can</b> <b>be</b> quite <b>fun</b> on a kind of purely visceral level. Just kind of being there and enjoying it. I don't venture, however, you'd want to give up your day job to do it.|$|R
