5|$|The Prussian War Ministry was interested, {{but some}} initial {{skepticism}} {{could only be}} overcome {{through a series of}} successful demonstrations. The pigeons proved relatively indifferent to explosions, but during battle a dovecote may need to be moved, and pigeons <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> time to orient to their new position. The problem of making carrier pigeons accept a displaced dovecote with only a minimum of retraining had been tackled with some success by the Italian army around 1880; the French artillery captain Reynaud solved it by raising the pigeons in an itinerant dovecote. There is no indication that Neubronner was aware of this work, but he knew there must be a solution as he had heard of an itinerant fairground worker who was also a pigeon fancier with a dovecote in his trailer. At the 1909 exhibitions in Dresden and Frankfurt he presented a small carriage that combined a darkroom with a mobile dovecote in flashy colors. In months of laborious work he trained young pigeons to return to the dovecote even after it was displaced.|$|E

25|$|An {{offer of}} {{accession}} is given once consensus is reached among members. The process takes about five years, on average, but it <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> countries {{almost a decade}} if the country is less than fully committed to the process, or if political issues interfere. The shortest accession negotiation was that of Kyrgyzstan, lasting 2 years and 10 months. The longest were that of Russia, lasting 19 years and 2 months, Vanuatu, lasting 17 years and 1 month, and China, lasting 15 years and 5 months.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the book}} industry, {{printers}} often fly some {{copies of the}} finished book to publishers as sample copies to aid sales or to be sent out for pre-release reviews. The remaining books often travel from the printing facility via sea freight. Accordingly, the delay between {{the approval of the}} pre-press proof and the arrival of books in a warehouse, much less in a retail store, <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> months. For books that tie into movie release-dates (particularly for children's films), publishers will arrange books to arrive in store up to two months prior to the movie release to build interest in the movie.|$|E
25|$|In cryptic crosswords, {{the clues}} are puzzles in themselves. A typical clue {{contains}} both a definition {{at the beginning}} or end of the clue and wordplay, which provides a way to manufacture the word indicated by the definition, and which may not parse logically. Cryptics usually give the length of their answers in parentheses after the clue, which is especially useful with multi-word answers. Certain signs indicate different forms of wordplay. Cryptics have a steeper learning curve than standard crosswords, as learning to interpret {{the different types of}} cryptic clues <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> practice. In Great Britain and throughout much of the Commonwealth, cryptics of varying degrees of difficulty are featured in many newspapers.|$|E

2500|$|In {{some poor}} {{countries}} the rising price of vegetable oil is causing problems. [...] There {{are those that}} say using a food crop for fuel sets up competition between food in poor countries and fuel in rich countries. [...] Some propose that fuel only be made from non-edible vegetable oils like jatropha oil. Others argue {{that the problem is}} more fundamental. The law of supply and demand predicts that if fewer farmers are producing food the price of food will rise. [...] It may take some time, as farmers <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> time to change which things they are growing, but increasing demand for biofuels is likely to result in price increases for many kinds of food. [...] Some have pointed out that there are poor farmers and poor countries making more money because of the higher price of vegetable oil.|$|E
