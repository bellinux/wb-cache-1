Si {{nanowires}} (NWs) {{have been}} converted to silicon-silicon carbide (Si-SiC) core-shell NWs at different conditions of substrate temperature in an ultra-high vacuum using a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) set-up. In-situ auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) allowed a control of the growth process. To evaluate structure and chemical modifications of their shape, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is used. Evidence of Si-carburization is shown by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and {{selected area electron diffraction}} (SAED) related investigation. Facet dependence of the carbon diffusion is shown with a maximum <b>carburization</b> <b>depth</b> of 20 nm on the 331 and 131 facet of the NWs. Si-SiC core-shell NWs free of planar defects have been obtained for conversion temperatures lower than 800 ºC...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{economic}} significance, industry demands on mathematical models, which {{allow for the}} prediction of realistic <b>carburization</b> and decarburization <b>depth</b> profiles. Analytical solutions of Fick’s law, however, are of limited aptitude, as the concentration dependence of the diffusion coefficient of carbon in steel cannot be considered. Thus, the present paper presents a numerical simulation tool based on the finite element method (FEM). A widespread commercially available program system was used to ensure industrial applicability {{and to make a}} contribution to the standardizing of operation control...|$|R
