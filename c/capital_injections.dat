40|$|This paper {{considers}} the optimal dividend problem with proportional reinsurance and <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> {{for a large}} insurance portfolio. In particular, the reinsurance premium {{is assumed to be}} calculated via the variance principle instead of the expected value principle. Our objective is to maximize the expectation of the discounted dividend payments minus the discounted costs of <b>capital</b> <b>injection.</b> This optimization problem is studied in four cases depending on whether <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> is allowed and whether there exist restrictions on dividend policies. In all cases, closed-form expressions for the value function and optimal dividend and reinsurance policies are obtained. From the results, we see that the optimal dividend distribution policy is of threshold type with a constant barrier, and that the optimal ceded proportion of risk exponentially decreases with the initial surplus and remains constant when the initial surplus exceeds the dividend barrier. Furthermore, we show that the optimization problem without <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> is the limiting case of the one with <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> when the proportional transaction cost goes to infinity. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the portfolio selection and <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> {{problem for a}} diffusion risk model within the classical Black–Scholes financial market. It is assumed that the original surplus process of an insurance portfolio is described by a drifted Brownian motion, and that the surplus can be invested in a risky asset and a risk-free asset. When the surplus hits zero, the company can inject capital to keep the surplus positive. In addition, {{it is assumed that}} both fixed and proportional costs are incurred upon each <b>capital</b> <b>injection.</b> Our objective is to minimize the expected value of the discounted <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> costs by controlling the investment policy and the <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> policy. We first prove the continuity of the value function and a verification theorem for the corresponding Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation. We then show that the optimal investment policy is a solution to a terminal value problem of an ordinary differential equation. In particular, explicit solutions are derived in some special cases and a series solution is obtained for the general case. Also, we propose a numerical method to solve the optimal investment and <b>capital</b> <b>injection</b> policies. Finally, a numerical study is carried out to illustrate the effect of the model parameters on the optimal policies...|$|R
