25|$|Starting in June 2006, Senior Vice President Richard M. Bowen III, the <b>chief</b> <b>underwriter</b> of Citigroup's Consumer Lending Group, began {{warning the}} board of {{directors}} about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses. The group bought and sold $90 billion of residential mortgages annually. Bowen's responsibility was essentially to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the unit's creditworthiness. When Bowen first blew the whistle in 2006, 60% of the mortgages were defective. The amount of bad mortgages began increasing throughout 2007 and eventually exceeded 80% of the volume. Many of the mortgages were not only defective, but were fraudulent. Bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications. On November 3, 2007, Bowen emailed Citigroup Chairman Robert Rubin and the bank's chief financial officer, head auditor and the chief risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses, claiming that the group's internal controls had broken down and requesting an outside investigation of his business unit. The subsequent investigation revealed that at the Consumer Lending Group had suffered a breakdown of internal controls since 2005. Regardless of the findings of the investigation, Bowen's charges were ignored, despite the fact that withholding such information from shareholders violated the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX), which he had pointed out. Citigroup CEO Charles Prince signed a certification that the bank was in compliance with SOX despite Bowen revealing this wasn't so. Citigroup eventually stripped Bowen of most of his responsibilities and informing him that his physical presence was no longer required at the bank. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission asked him to testify about Citigroup's role in the mortgage crisis, and he did so, appearing {{as one of the first}} witnesses before the Commission in April 2010.|$|E

5000|$|The Chicago Opera Association was {{a company}} that {{produced}} seven seasons of grand opera in Chicago’s Auditorium Theater from 1915 to 1921. The founding artistic director and principal conductor was Cleofonte Campanini, while the general manager and <b>chief</b> <b>underwriter</b> was Harold F. McCormick. When Campanini died in December 1919 he {{was replaced by the}} composer Gino Marinuzzi, who staged his own [...] "Jacquerie" [...] as the opening production of the 1920/21 season.|$|E
50|$|A sudden {{economic}} and population boom led the new President of Argentina, Julio Roca, to commission the development in 1881 of an ambitious port {{to supplement the}} recently developed facilities at La Boca, in Buenos Aires's southside. Approved by the Argentine Congress in 1882 and financed by the prominent London-based Barings Bank (the <b>chief</b> <b>underwriter</b> of Argentine bonds and investment, at the time), the project required the reclaiming of over 200 hectares (500 acres) of underwater land and was accompanied by the widening of the promenade into what became Leandro Alem Avenue.|$|E

These improvements were capped by the installation of a decorative fountain on the median, for which an Argentine student of Auguste Rodin's, Lola Mora, was commissioned. Unveiled in 1903, the Font of the Nereids sparked moralist outrage over its nude Venus, and the masterpiece was relocated to its present Puerto Madero site in 1918.|$|E
50|$|Madero twice {{proposed}} {{the construction of}} a port facing the Plaza de Mayo, in 1861 and 1869; but the proposals, the second of which obtained the Interior Ministry's endorsement, were ultimately passed over for a design by local engineer Luis Huergo, whose plans called for a dock on the mouth of the Riachuelo (a river flowing along the city's industrial southside). Following the construction of the Port of La Boca, in the 1870s, a sudden economic and population boom led the new President of Argentina, Julio Roca, to commission the development in 1881 of a new, much larger port. The Director of Riachuelo Works, Luis Huergo, presented plans of his own design for a port of staggered docks, rather like the bittings on a key. The seasoned Madero, however, treveled to London, where he obtained both the services of renowned British engineer Sir John Hawkshaw and financing for the project from Barings Bank (the <b>chief</b> <b>underwriter</b> of Argentine bonds and investment, at the time).|$|E
5000|$|However, {{even without}} the {{too big to fail}} syndrome, the {{short-term}} structure of compensation packages creates perverse incentives for executives to maximize the short-term performance of their companies {{at the expense of the}} long term. William K. Black developed the concept of control fraud to describe executives who pervert good business rules to transfer substantial wealth to themselves from shareholders and customers. Their companies may report phenomenal profits in the short term only to lose substantial amounts of money when their Ponzi schemes finally collapse. Some of the individuals Black described were prosecuted for fraud, but many are allowed to keep their wealth with little more than a public rebuke that seems to have little impact on their future. [...] Eileen Foster was fired as a Vice President of Bank of America for trying too hard to inform her managers of systematic fraud in their home loans unit. Richard Bowen, <b>chief</b> <b>underwriter</b> of Citigroup's consumer division, was demoted with 218 of his 220 employees reassigned allegedly for attempting to inform several senior executives that over 80 percent of their mortgages violated Citigroup's own standards.|$|E
5000|$|Subprime lending {{standards}} {{declined in the}} USA: in early 2000, a subprime borrower had a FICO score of 660 or less. By 2005, many lenders dropped the required FICO score to 620, making {{it much easier to}} qualify for prime loans and making subprime lending a riskier business. Proof of income and assets were de-emphasized. Loans moved from full documentation to low documentation to no documentation. One subprime mortgage product that gained wide acceptance was the no income, no job, no asset verification required (NINJA) mortgage. Informally, these loans were aptly referred to as [...] "liar loans" [...] because they encouraged borrowers to be less than honest in the loan application process. [...] Testimony given to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission by Richard M. Bowen III on events during his tenure as the Business <b>Chief</b> <b>Underwriter</b> for Correspondent Lending in the Consumer Lending Group for Citigroup (where he was responsible for over 220 professional underwriters) suggests that by the final years of the US housing bubble (2006-2007), the collapse of mortgage underwriting standards was endemic. His testimony stated that by 2006, 60% of mortgages purchased by Citi from some 1,600 mortgage companies were [...] "defective" [...] (were not underwritten to policy, or did not contain all policy-required documents)—this, despite the fact that each of these 1,600 originators was contractually responsible (certified via representations and warrantees) that its mortgage originations met Citi's standards. Moreover, during 2007, [...] "defective mortgages (from mortgage originators contractually bound to perform underwriting to Citi's standards) increased ... to over 80% of production".|$|E
