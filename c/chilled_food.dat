5|$|When the U.S. entered World War I in 1917, the American ice trade {{received}} a temporary boost to production. Shipments of <b>chilled</b> <b>food</b> to Europe surged during the war, placing significant {{demands on the}} country's existing refrigeration capabilities, while the need to produce munitions for the war effort meant that ammonia and coal for refrigeration plants were in short supply. The U.S. government worked together with the plant and natural ice industries to promote the use of natural ice to relieve the burden and maintain adequate supplies. For Britain and Norway, however, the war impacted badly on the natural ice trade; the German attempt to blockade the North Sea with U-boats made shipments difficult and Britain relied increasingly more heavily on its limited number of ice plants for supplies instead.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Along {{with the}} rapid {{development}} of national economy and the increasing of life level day by day, people have a new understanding on frozen and <b>chilled</b> <b>foods.</b> At the same time food safety problems have also been paid attention. RFID is a new type automatic identification technology with good function characteristic, which can satisfy efficiency requirements of commodity processing, and it has many advantages compared with the bar code and can strictly control food quality in cold-chain logistics to promote healthy development of cold chain logistics...|$|R
