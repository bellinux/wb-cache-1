40|$|The magnetocrystalline {{anisotropy}} constants of {{high quality}} single crystals of gadolinium have been measured using torque magnetometry. The redetermination of the anisotropy constants was necessary due to the poor agreement between the previous measurements which had been made on uncharacterized material of varying quality. The easy direction of magnetization was determined from the anisotropy constants {{and it is in}} good agreement with the direct measurements of Corner and Tanner (1976), made on the same crystal, and the neutron diffraction results of Cable and Wollan (1968). It is suggested that the lack of agreement in the previous determinations of the constants was due {{to the quality of the}} crystals used, particularly with respect to their oxygen content. A treatment of the magnetostatic energy of nonmagnetic inclusions in gadolinium and their contribution to the total anisotropy is given which can explain the discrepancies between the results of the various previous investigations of the easy direction and anisotropy. The magnetic domain structure of gadolinium was investigated using the Bitter wet <b>colloid</b> <b>technique</b> and a dry <b>colloid</b> <b>technique</b> suitable for low temperature work (90 K to 291 K). The formation of domains at the Curie temperature (291 K) and also the disappearance of a clear domain structure at about 230 K, below which there is an easy cone of magnetization, was observed. No magnetic domains were observed below 230 K. Around 230 K it was expected that there would not be a clear domain structure due to the low value of the anisotropy but the reasons for the non-appearance of domains below about 150 K. where the anisotropy is large again, are not clear as Corner and Saad (19 77 a) have observed clear domain patterns on gadolinium at 77 K...|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} forces between {{bovine serum}} albumin (BSA) layers adsorbed on silica surfaces have been measured using an {{atomic force microscope}} (AFM) {{in conjunction with the}} <b>colloid</b> probe <b>technique.</b> Measurements of force-distance curves were made at different pH values and electrolyte concentrations (NaCl and CaCl 2). The interaction at long range is dominated by electrical double-layer forces, while at short surface separations an additional repulsion due to the compression of the adsorbed protein layers appears. However, prior to this steric interaction, when the pH is above the isoelectric point of the protein and at high salt concentration, a non-DLVO repulsive interaction is observed. This behavior is explained if the presence of hydration forces in the system is assumed. Theoretical predictions including a hydration term in the DLVO theory fit the experimental results satisfactorily.

40|$|The {{magnetostriction}} and magnetization {{process of}} a twin-free Tb 0. 27 Dy 0. 73 Fe 2 single crystal along the direction {{has been studied}} by strain gauge, vibrating sample magnetometer, and domain observation techniques. It was observed that the magnetostriction of the sample remained unchanged with increasing magnetic fields when H≪ 1 kOe and quickly increased in the range 1 ≪H≪ 7. 5 kOe. No "jump" effect was observed during the magnetization process and the magnetostrictive hysteresis was large when H≪ 2. 5 kOe. Observations by the Bitter <b>colloid</b> <b>technique</b> at room temperature revealed curved domain walls which became straight at higher and lower temperatures in { 100 } and { 111 }, respectively, indicating the transition to different 180 ° walls for H≪ 1 kOe. The domain patterns were clearest on a { 100 } surface. Above the spin reorientation temperature, 109 ° and 71 ° wall motions dominated the magnetization process in the range 1. 5 kOe≪H≪ 4 kOe, but below it, clear 90 ° wall motions were observed. Little change in the magnetized domain pattern was observed at different temperatures suggesting that many domain walls occupy the same planes.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Nucleolar {{organizer}} Regions (NORs) {{are situated}} within the nucleolus of a cell. The proteins are selectively stained by the silver <b>colloid</b> <b>technique</b> {{that is known}} as the AgNOR technique. AgNOR stain can be visualized as a black dot under the optical microscope. The present study aimed to evaluate the cases for quantitative estimation of AgNORs in the epithelial cells in various grades of gingival overgrowth to that of normal gingival tissues. Materials and Methods: Only preadolescent and adolescent groups aged up to 14 years were selected. Twenty normal and 31 disease cases of gingival overgrowth were selected. The tissue sections were stained by the hematoxylin and eosin (HandE) technique for the routine histological evaluation, while the AgNOR counts were performed through the improved one-step method of Ploton et al. Results: HandE staining revealed five different types of gingival overgrowth. The plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), and AgNOR count were not significantly (P&# 62; 0. 05) higher than that of control cases in pyogenic granuloma, puberty gingivitis, and in drug-induced gingival overgrowth cases. In gingival fibromatosis cases, for comparison of different indices t-tests were done.

This study was designed to evaluate NORs as determinants of precancerous and squamous cell carcinoma. Materials and methods. A silver <b>colloid</b> <b>technique</b> was applied on paraffin sections of 40 cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma and 25 cases of precancerous lesions; 15 specimens of normal epithelium were selected for the control group. After staining with silver nitrate, argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs) were counted in 100 epithelial cells in three groups with the use of an oil immersion and × 1000 objective lens. One-way ANOVA and a post hoc Tukey test were used for statistical analysis. Results. The mean numbers and standard deviations of AgNORs were 1. 58 ± 0. 76 in normal epithelium, 2. 1 ± 1. 05 in precancerous lesions and 2. 43 ± 1. 33 in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). There were statistically significant differences in AgNORs numbers between the groups (P< 0. 001) and significant differences in precancerous lesions between dysplastic and non-dysplastic epithelia (P< 0. 001).

SLN identification is achieved using the blue-dye and radioactive <b>colloids</b> <b>techniques,</b> which are sometimes combined with lymphoscintigraphy. Furthermore, intra-operative gamma acoustic probes, as well as gamma imaging probes are used during surgery. The {{purpose of this study}} is the construction of a gamma probe for sentinel lymph node imaging and its optimization in terms of sensitivity with respect to spatial resolution. The reference probe has small field of view (2. 5 x 2. 5 cm(2)) and is based on a position sensitive photomultiplier tube (PSPMT) coupled to a pixellated CsI(Tl) scintillator.

40|$|Using <b>colloid</b> <b>techniques</b> domain {{structure}} {{has been studied}} in several overlay components used in contemporary bubble devices. In isolated elements the demagnetized state is generally simple, containing {{a small number of}} domains. The influence of anisotropy on domain structure is demonstrated. Elements initially respond to applied fields by reversible domain boundary movement but in each case it has been found that partial saturation and hysteresis occur once the applied field exceeds a critical value, H(_s). This causes the formation of remanent states with 'magnetization buckling' similar to that found in larger samples of thin-film permalloy. The relationship between and element geometry and thickness and the formation of buckled states by a rotating field were investigated. Such states may adversely affect the operation of a bubble device. The approach to partial saturation in a simple bar has been modelled {{on the basis of a}} curved domain wall and approximate values for the saturation field calculated. The external field profile of the bar has also been obtained. Domain structure in various connected chevron columns (bubble detectors) was also studied. In contrast to isolated elements the initial 'zero-field' state in these components is generally one of saturation. This state can be broken by components of applied field parallel or perpendicular to the column and again magnetization buckling is involved. Magnetoresistance changes related to the buckled state were measured and found to be consistent with the colloid observations. These observations can be used to explain the characteristic magnetoresistance signal of a chevron column in a rotating field...|$|R

The thesis is especially concerned with the rare earth element terbium which exhibits ferromagnetism at temperatures below ~ 222 K. The exchange interaction associated with ferromagnetic ordering is discussed in CHAPTER TWO, while CHAPTER THREE, which deals specifically with the rare earth elements, includes a section on the RKKY exchange interaction and its relevance to the magnetic properties of some of the rare earth metals. The magnetic properties of terbium are also included. In particular, the thesis deals with magnetic domains and their observation. The energy minimizing process of domain formation is discussed in detail and various types of domain configurations are shown for cubic and hexagonal symmetry. CHAPTER FIVE represents a review of some of the methods of domain observation. Ferromagnetic domains have been observed in a single crystal of 99. 99 % pure terbium.

METHODS: A silver <b>colloid</b> <b>technique</b> that shows interphase nucleolar organiser regions (AgNORs) {{has been applied to}} representative paraffin sections from 138 cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the bronchus treated by surgical resection of the primary tumour at East Birmingham Hospital in 1977. Of the 138 patients, 23 (17 %) were alive 10 years after their operation. RESULTS: The mean (SD) AgNOR count per cell was significantly higher for all grades of malignancy (well differentiated 10. 5 (2. 6), moderately differentiated 10. 7 (3. 2), and poorly differentiated 12. 7 (4. 5)) than for normal pseudostratified columnar epithelium from non-affected areas (2. 3 (0. 78)). There was a trend for AgNOR counts to be higher in poorly differentiated tumours, but a wide range of AgNOR counts was observed in all histological grades. AgNOR counts did not predict clinical outcome, irrespective of the stage of the disease, and did not relate to DNA ploidy or the percentage of cells in the proliferation phase of the cell cycle. Nine of 47 patients (19 %) with tumours classified as DNA diploid and eight of 63 patients (13 %) with DNA aneuploid tumours were alive 10 years after operation. Principal component analysis identified the clinicopathological stage of disease as the variable best related to survival. The percentage of patients surviving 10 years was 30 % for stage I, 20 % for stage II, 10 % for stage IIIa, 9 % for stage IIIb, and none for stage IV.

For hard squares our predictions feature at intermediate packing fraction a smectic phase, which is however expected to be unstable due to thermal fluctuations. This implies that for hard squares the theory predicts either a vacancy-rich second-order transition or a vacancy-poor weakly first-order phase transition at higher density.

40|$|The {{investigations}} {{described in}} this thesis deal with the influence of substrates and seedlayers on the structural and magnetic properties of Co- Cr films. The increased importance of the substrates and seedlayers lies in the tendency that in Co-Cr thin film production for recording applications the medium thickness has decreased to about 0. 1 ~m; therefore, {{in order to obtain}} Co-Cr films suitable for recording, the structural and magnetic properties should preferably be as homogeneous as possible. Every inhomogeneity at the substrate material / Co-Cr film interface should be avoided by tailoring the deposition conditions and by choosing the optimal substrate material. In chapter 2 a de scription is given of the methods that are used for characterization of the Co-Cr films and for electron microscopy sample preparation. The Bitter <b>colloid</b> <b>technique</b> that is used as a magnetic contrast observation technique is considered in detail and is compared to other domain observation techniques such as modified differential phase contrast microscopy (MDPC), magnetic force microscopy (MFM), scanning electron microscopy with polarization analysis (SEMPA) and Kerr microscopy. It is shown (chapter 3) that depending on the deposition conditions of the Co-Cr films two growth mechanisms can be discerned: from AES depth profiling measurements it was concluded that using germanium seedlayers an interdiffusive re action layer develops, containing Co, Ge and to a lesser degree Cr. The interdiffusive re action layer acts as a homogeneous nucleation layer, leading to hcp c-axis textured nucleation of Co-Cr crystallites from the first stage of growth and also as a relaxation layer {{in the case of a}} lattice misfit. Application of silicon nitride seedlayers results in a much more distinctive interface between the seedlayer and the Co-Cr film. No c-axis textured nucleation from the first stage of growth was found in this case, but with increasing thickness the Co-Cr film became increasingly textured in the (00. 1] direction. The c-axis dispersion from the normal ofthe film at 0. 1 ~m thickness was found to be determined by the dispersion of the first about 5 nm Co-Cr. The calculated strain in the fIlms was found to decrease an order of magnitude within the thickness range 5 - 200 nm for Co-Cr films on a germanium seedlayer. Vibrating sample magnetometer and anomalous Hall effect measurements showed (chapter 4) that Co-Cr films of 5 nm thickness can exhibit a perpendicular anisotropy, depending on the choice of substrate materialor deposition conditions. By monitoring the in-plane remanence ratio (Mr!Ms) //, it was shown that well-textured Co-Cr films exhibit a perpendicular anisotropy at small (t 50 nm) thicknesses, but have a large in-plane remence ratio at intermediate thicknesses. This behaviour could be qualitatively explained by considering the presence / absence of the initial layer, the in-plane magnetization contributions in the domain walls and the developments of magneoelastic and magnetocrystalline anisotropy contributions with increasing thickness. Non-optimized deposition conditions or substrate materials result in Co-Cr fi 1 ms with inferior magnetic properties. In chapter 5 domain observations are given of well-textured low and high coercive Co-Cr fi 1 ms, obtained by Bitter colloid technique: bubbles and stripe domains were observed, in confirmation with earlier reports. MDPC observations show the existence of a small scale (1 ~m) domains. The ripple period seems to vary with its magnetic history. Written bits could reproduced using the Bitter <b>colloid</b> <b>technique</b> down to a Co-Cr fi 1 m thickness of about 25 nm, for fi 1 ms with a quality factor Q>l. Investigations in the depth direction of well-textured 0. 1 ~m Co-Cr fi 1 ms by ion beam etching experiments revealed that the written magnetization penetrates the fi 1 m down to a fi 1 m thickness of at least 40 nm. The transition region between the written bits did not change in regularity on top and inside the fi 1 m. It was concluded (chapter 6) that Co-Cr f 1 lms of 0. 1 ~m thickness with suitable properties for recording can be prepared with the right choice of deposition conditions and substrate materials; the preparation of the first 30 nm is of crucial importance in order to achieve this. Improved experimental magnetic contrast observation techniques wi 1 l lead to a better understanding of micromagnetic processes in Co-Cr fi 1 ms. Awaiting the developments in the fields of head design and tribology, Co-Cr fi 1 ms can establish themselves in high density magnetic storage applications...|$|E
40|$|The domains {{structure}} of cobalt, gadolinium and terbium have been investigated; single crystals of gadolinium and terbium, were obtained {{in which the}} oxide content was considerably reduced by a solid state electrolysis technique. The Bitter technique {{has been used for}} most of the observations with a modified colloid, but a dry <b>colloid</b> <b>technique</b> has been used at temperatures below 240 K or higher than room temperature. Two different pieces of apparatus were designed for use at high or low temperatures. In the case of cobalt single crystals the results obtained at room, temperature are similar to those obtained previously. The pattern at 77 K was as expected from the anisotropy data. The lengths of daggers of reverse magnetization and the widths of their bases were found to be in direct proportion (for simple and complex daggers). The variation of the exchange constant A with temperature was also determined. It was not possible to observe a closure domain structure, however this did not rule out the possibility of a partial structure being present on the basal plane, though the variation of dam in width with temperature agrees best with that of Kittel model. The domain, {{structure of}} gadolinium was much easier to analyse than that of cobalt. At 274 K patterns on planes containing the c-axis shoved parallel l 80 walls, with the development of partial closure structures at the surface near the basal plane and at the oxide inclusions. Basal plane patterns indicate that the l 80 vails are not plane and give more detailed information about the mixed nature of the basal structure. The change in domain structure has been studied as the temperature is reduced to 77 K and under the influence of magnetic fields up to l 400 Oe. Unexpected results were obtained when the normal field produced by a permanent magnet was applied to the basal plane. Such arrangements produced the well known honeycomb structure which was observed on other materials after an applied field of few K. Oe. was applied parallel or perpendicular to the c-axis. This was believed {{to be the result of}} a closure structure with magnetisation laid freely in basal plane. The non-uniformity of' the lines of force produced by such magnet will re-orient the direction of the magnetic moment within the closure region. The domain structure in a cube shaped terbium single crystal was observed at 210 K and different possibilities for the internal configuration were given. Agreement between experimental observation and the proposed model which consists of plate type domains magnetized along the b(_ 1) and b(_ 2) axis but not along the third axis b(_ 3) -axis, which is perpendicular to one surface.

METHODS: In the ALMANAC multicentre trial validation phase, we took SNB samples from 842 patients with node negative, invasive breast cancer with use of a blue dye and radiolabelled <b>colloid</b> mapping <b>technique</b> at the peritumoural injection site. All patients underwent standard axillary treatment after SNB. Seventy-five of the 842 patients had multifocal lesions on final histopathologic examination. The following analysis is focused on patients with multifocal lesions. RESULTS: A mean number of 2. 4 SNs were identified in 71 of 75 patients (identification rate: 94. 7...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this study, a {{new type}} of a double-layer ceramic {{membrane}} was used for the filtration of wastewater. The synthesized membrane consists of a macroporous substrate (with pore size of about 0. 1 μm) prepared following the <b>colloid</b> filtration <b>technique</b> and a thin film functional layer (with pore size of about 10 nm) carried out according to the sol–gel preparation method. The ceramic membranes were tested for the removal of cadmium, zinc, Methylene Blue and Malachite Green from water under a pressure of 5 bar and a treatment time of 2 h. Liquid filtration and flow tests through these membranes resulted in a rejection rate of 100 % for Methylene Blue and Malachite Green. This paper also presents the ability of the tubular membrane prepared to separate heavy metals (cadmium and zinc) from their synthetic aqueous solutions. The influence of the applied pressure, feed solute concentration, feed pH on the rejection of cadmium and zinc ions was studied. Retention rates of cadmium and zinc ions of 100 % were observed for an initial feed concentration of 10 − 4 mol/L...|$|R
40|$|Development {{of novel}} and {{effective}} drug delivery systems for controlled release of bioactive molecules is {{of critical importance}} in the ﬁeld of regenerative medicine. Here, oppositely charged gelatin nanospheres are incorporated into silk ﬁbroin nanoﬁbers through a <b>colloid</b> electrospinning <b>technique.</b> A novel ﬁbrous nano-in-nano drug delivery system is fabricated {{without the use of}} any organic solvent. The distribution of ﬂuorescently labeled gelatin A and B nanospheres inside the nanoﬁbers can be ﬁne-tuned by simple adjustment of the weight ratio between the nanospheres and the relative feeding rate of core and shell solutions containing nanospheres by using single and coaxial nozzle electrospinning, respectively. Incorporation of vancomycin-loaded gelatin B nanospheres into the silk ﬁbroin nanoﬁbrous membranes results into a more sustained release of vancomycin, compared to the gelatin nanospheres free membranes. In addition, these membranes exhibit excellent and prolonged antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, these membranes support the attachment, spreading, and proliferation of periodontal ligament cells. These results suggest that the beneﬁcial properties of gelatin nanospheres can be exploited to improve the biological functionality of electrospun nanoﬁbrous silk ﬁbroin membranes. status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|The {{challenge}} of the 21 st Century is to produce catalysts {{that are capable of}} 100 % selectivity for the desired reactions, often called “green chemistry”. This provides us with means to produce chemicals and fuels without byproducts and waste. The molecular ingredients of catalytic selectivity of metals include the control of surface structure, the mobility of adsorbates on the catalytically active surface, oxide-metal interface sites, selective site blocking, and the presence of hydrogen. Metal nanoparticles are produced by lithographic techniques as well as by <b>colloid</b> science <b>techniques</b> in solutions in the range of 1 - 12 nm in size with the desired surface structures. These nanoparticle arrays are supported on 2 dimensional oxide supports or encapsulated in 3 -dimensional mesoporous high surface area oxides, and their catalytic selectivities for hydrocarbon conversion reactions and partial oxidation reactions are being explored. Techniques of characterization are different for 2 -dimensional and 3 -dimensional nanoparticle catalysts, and these will also be described in the lecture. The polymer capping over these growing metal nanoparticles protect them from aggregation but doe...|$|R
40|$|The atomic force {{microscope}} (AFM) <b>colloid</b> probe <b>technique</b> {{was utilized}} to measure cohesion forces (separation energy) between three drug systems {{as a function of}} relative humidity (RH). The subsequent data was correlated with in vitro aerosolization data collected over the same RH range. Three drug-only systems were chosen for study; salbutaniol sulphate (SS), triamcinolone acetonide (TAA), and di-sodium cromoglycate (DSCG). Analysis of the AFM and in vitro data suggested good correlations, with the separation energy being related inversely to the aerosolization performance (measured as fine particle fraction, FPFLD). In addition, the relationship between, cohesion, RH, and aerosolization performance was drug specific. For example, an increase in RH between 15 % and 75 % resulted in increased cohesion and decreased FPFLD for SS and DSCG. In comparison, for TAA, a decrease in cohesion and increased FPFLD was observed when RH was increased (15 - 75 %). Linear regression analysis comparing AFM with in vitro data indicated R- 2 values > 0. 80, for all data sets, suggesting the AFM could be used to indicate in vitro aerosolization performance.

40|$|The {{development}} of materials that combine the excellent mechanical strength of cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) with the lubricating properties of hyaluronic acid (HA) is a new, promising approach to cartilage implants not explored so far. A simple, solvent-free method {{to produce a}} very lubricating, strong cellulosic material by covalently attaching HA {{to the surface of}} CNF films is described in this work. A detailed analysis of the tribological properties of the CNF films with and without HA is also presented. Surface and friction forces at micro/nanoscale between model hard surfaces (glass microspheres) and the CNF thin films were measured using an atomic force microscope and the <b>colloid</b> probe <b>technique.</b> The effect of HA attachment, the pH and the ionic strength of the aqueous medium on the forces was examined. Excellent lubrication was observed for CNF films with HA attached in conditions where the HA layer was highly hydrated. These results pave the way for the {{development of}} new nanocellulose-based materials with good lubrication properties {{that could be used in}} biomedical applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

25|$|Colloidal {{lithography}} is {{inexpensive and}} can be used to create surfaces with controlled heights and diameters. Nanocolliods are used as an etch mask by spreading them along the material surface, and then ion beam bombardment or film evaporation is used to etch away around the nanocolliods, creating nanocolumns and nanopits, respectively. The final surface structure can be controlled by varying the area covered by colloids and the colloid size. The area covered by the colloids can be changed by modifying the ionic strength of the <b>colloid</b> solution. This <b>technique</b> is able to create large patterned surface areas, which is necessary for tissue engineering applications.|$|R
40|$|Colloidal {{suspensions}} are {{an experimental}} model system for studying structural and mechanical properties of soft materials. These properties are manifested differently in colloidal solid-like phases such as crystals, glasses and gels. To further understand relations between structural and mechanical properties, {{it is necessary}} to develop well-defined <b>colloids</b> and employ <b>techniques</b> such as microscopy and rheology to study the structure and mechanics of their suspensions. This thesis presents five experimental chapters dealing with the synthesis and characterization of colloids and their suspensions.

40|$|We report here, for {{the first}} time, the surface-enhanced Raman {{scattering}} (SERS) spectra of resveratrol using KNO 3 -aggregated citrate-reduced silver (Ag) <b>colloids.</b> The <b>technique</b> provided a substantial spectral enhancement and therefore good quality spectra of resveratrol at parts per million (ppm) concentrations. The detection limit {{was found to be}} < 1 μM, equivalent to < 0. 2 ppm. The SERS profile additionally closely resembled its normal solid-state Raman spectrum with some changes in relative intensity. These intensity changes, together with a precise band assignment aided by density functional theory calculations at the B 3 LYP/ 6 – 31 G(d) level, allowed the determination of the structural orientation of the adsorbed resveratrol {{on the surface of the}} metal nanoparticles. In particular, the SERS spectra obtained at different resveratrol concentrations exhibited concentration-dependent features, suggesting an influence of surface coverage on the orientation of the adsorbed molecules. At a high concentration, an adoption of close-to-upright orientation of resveratrol adsorbed on the metal surface through the p-OH phenyl ring is favoured. The binding structure is, however, altered at lower surface coverage when the concentration decreases to a tilted orientation with the trans-olefin C=C bond aligning closer to parallel to the surface of the Ag nanoparticles. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Drug {{delivery}} via the eye, nose, {{gastrointestinal tract}} and lung {{is of great}} interest as they represent patient-compliant and facile methods to administer drugs. However, for a drug to reach the systemic circulation it must penetrate the “mucus barrier”. An understanding {{of the characteristics of}} the mucus barrier is therefore important in the design of mucus penetrating drug delivery vehicles e. g. nanoparticles. Here, a range of nanoparticles – silica, aluminium coated silica, poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and PEGylated PLGA – each with known but different physicochemical characteristics were examined in the presence of mucin to identify those characteristics that engender nanoparticle/mucin interactions and thus, to define “design rules” for mucus penetrating (nano) particles (MPP), {{at least in terms of}} the surface characteristics of charge and hydrophilicity. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and rheology have been used to assess the interaction between such nanoparticles and mucin. It was found that negatively charged and hydrophilic nanoparticles do not exhibit an interaction with mucin whereas positively charged and hydrophobic nanoparticles show a strong interaction. Surface grafted poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains significantly reduced this interaction. This study clearly demonstrates that the established <b>colloid</b> science <b>techniques</b> of DLS and rheology are very powerful screening tools to probe nanoparticle/mucin interactions...|$|R

The cell adhesion force of the HAp/PLLA microspheres was 1. 4 -fold stronger {{than that of the}} bare PLLA microspheres. When the microspheres were pretreated with a culture medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum, the cell adhesion force of the HAp/PLLA microspheres was increased by a factor of 2. 1; in contrast, no change was observed in the cell adhesion force of the bare PLLA microspheres before/after the pretreatment. Indeed, the cell adhesion force of the HAp/PLLA was 2. 8 -fold larger than that of the bare PLLA after the pretreatment. Additionally, we have investigated the effect of interfacial serum proteins on the zeta potentials of these microspheres. On the basis of the obtained results, possible mechanism of cell adhesion to the HAp/PLLA and bare PLLA microspheres in the presence/absence of the interfacial serum proteins is discussed...|$|R
