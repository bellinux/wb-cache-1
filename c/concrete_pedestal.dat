5|$|Even {{with the}} success of the fund drive, the {{pedestal}} was not completed until April 1886. Immediately thereafter, reassembly of the statue began. Eiffel's iron framework was anchored to steel I-beams within the <b>concrete</b> <b>pedestal</b> and assembled. Once this was done, the sections of skin were carefully attached. Due to the width of the pedestal, {{it was not possible to}} erect scaffolding, and workers dangled from ropes while installing the skin sections. Nevertheless, no one died during the construction. Bartholdi had planned to put floodlights on the torch's balcony to illuminate it; a week before the dedication, the Army Corps of Engineers vetoed the proposal, fearing that ships' pilots passing the statue would be blinded. Instead, Bartholdi cut portholes in the torch—which was covered with gold leaf—and placed the lights inside them. A power plant was installed on the island to light the torch and for other electrical needs. After the skin was completed, renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, co-designer of New York's Central Park and Brooklyn's Prospect Park, supervised a cleanup of Bedloe's Island in anticipation of the dedication.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{was soon}} {{revealed}} that the cannon had been appropriated by MIT {{in retaliation for the}} previous year's pranks, and relocated to Cambridge. The MIT team consisted of about 30 hackers, of which two flew to Pasadena and five drove cross-country. While acquiring the cannon disguised as construction contractors, the hackers had run-ins with a Caltech security guard and physical plant worker, to whom they explained that they were moving the cannon in preparation for the pouring of a <b>concrete</b> <b>pedestal.</b> Once off Caltech's campus, a local resident called in a noise complaint, and the Pasadena police arrived but did not recognize the then-disguised cannon. On the way to the shipping company, the trailer's hitch cracked, necessitating a slow trip on surface roads, and on arrival they were unable to physically remove the cannon from the trailer, causing them to spend an extra $1000 for the services of a company that specialized in moving large film props.|$|E
25|$|King Taksin statue was {{unveiled}} {{in the middle}} of Wongwian Yai (the Big Traffic Circle) in Thonburi, at the intersection of Prajadhipok/Inthara Phithak/Lat Ya/Somdet Phra Chao Taksin Roads. The king is portrayed with his right hand holding a sword, measuring approximately 9 metres in height from his horse's feet to the spire of his hat, rests on a reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>pedestal</b> of 8.90 × 1.80 × 3.90 metres. There are four frames of stucco relief on {{the two sides of the}} pedestal. The opening ceremony of this monument was held on April 17, 1954 and the royal homage-paying fair takes place annually on December 28. The king today officially comes to pay respect to King Taksin statue.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explains}} on {{the numerical}} study of localized damage mechanism in <b>concrete</b> <b>pedestals</b> supporting bridge girder bearings. It examined the structural response of <b>concrete</b> <b>pedestals</b> dealing with complex contact interaction behaviour between steel bearing plate and concrete. Three dimensional nonlinear explicit finite element micro models of <b>concrete</b> <b>pedestals</b> were analyzed with various pedestal heights, edge clearance distances, loading geometries, confinement reinforcements and loading eccentricities. Also included are few mitigation strategies had been proposed {{to minimize the}} effect of localized failure and therefore which can then improve the structural performance of <b>concrete</b> <b>pedestals...</b>|$|R

500|$|The routing of M-107 {{had been}} largely {{unchanged}} since designation. The designation was created in 1935 {{as a tribute to}} the 107th Engineer Combat Battalion. The highway was dedicated on June 13, 1954 to the battalion at a ceremony by Highway Commissioner Charles M. Ziegler. This ceremony was attended by approximately 1,200 people at a highway turnout located along the roadway [...] west of Silver City.

40|$|Bridge girder {{bearings}} rest on pedestals {{to transfer}} the loading safely to the pier headstock. In spite {{of the existence of}} industry guidelines, due to construction complexities, such guidelines are often overlooked. Further, there is paucity of research on the performance of pedestals, although their failure could cause exorbitant maintenance costs. Although reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>pedestals</b> are recommended in the industry design guidelines, unreinforced concrete and/ or epoxy glue pedestals are provided due to construction issues; such pedestals fail within {{a very short period of}} service. With a view to understanding the response of pedestals subject to monotonic loading, a three-dimensional nonlinear explicit finite element micro-model of unreinforced and reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>pedestals</b> has been developed. Contact and material nonlinearity have been accounted for in the model. It is shown that the unreinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>pedestals</b> suffer from localised edge stress singularities, the failure of which was comparable to those in the field. The reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>pedestals,</b> on the other hand, distribute the loading without edge stress singularity, again conforming to the field experience...|$|R

50|$|This garden, {{featuring}} {{an array}} of 22 blue porcelain Fu Dog statues in front of white fir trees, was originally commissioned in 1932 to display Allerton's collection of the ceramic statues. The {{focal point of the}} garden is these 22 statues mounted on <b>concrete</b> <b>pedestals.</b> Standing behind the pedestals are opposing rows of fir trees that form the garden's outer border. To allow enough sunlight to reach the garden, the surrounding woods were cut back approximately 100 feet. North of this garden stands the House of the Golden Buddhas, a folly which permits an aerial view of the garden.|$|R
