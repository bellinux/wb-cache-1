This article describes {{the case of the}} development and introduction of electronic data exchange in the Dutch <b>Criminal</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>chain.</b> Basic theories on the introduction of IT in justice organizations are tested by means of qualitative empirical research. Case flow management automation is technically feasible in the <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>chain</b> but presupposes willingness of different organizations attached to that chain to adapt working processes for that purpose. The Dutch case shows a relative failure of {{the development and implementation of}} an integrated case flow management system for the entire chain (from the police via the public prosecutions office and the courts up to the prison service). It also shows a relative success of connecting xml-based data files to different reference indexes using intelligent agent software. Compared to the intended integrated case flow management system this solution for inter-organizational data exchange is much more simple and flexible because it does not demand a far reaching adaptation of internal organizational routines. It avoids the complexities of justice organizations and simplifies tasks related to data exchange. The data therefore are more accurate and are faster available. The most important advantage however is that risks of failure of development and implementation are reduced. </p...|$|E
40|$|Since 2005, the Belgian human {{exploitation}} law explicitly {{includes the}} exploitation of labour force. In the revised law, an act is considered exploitative {{when a person is}} employed in conditions which are against human dignity. What this means in practice, is however unclear. Neither the law, nor the explanatory memorandum provide sufficient clarification. The law thus allows scope for discretion, which implies certain risks. This was studied in two qualitative research projects. The findings show that police officers’ and public prosecutors’ interpretations of the law depend on the relationship between actors in the <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>chain,</b> personal motivation, case load and the division of tasks between public prosecutors. These aspects lead to different investigation and prosecution practices in different judicial districts, which implies the risk of inequality of justice and the relocation of crime. Possible solutions are the provision of legal clarity and binding guidelines imposed by the College of Public Prosecutors-General...|$|E
40|$|This book {{focuses on}} {{one part of}} the {{judicial}} system: the <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>chain.</b> This involves all the activities and actors dealing with policing, prosecution, judgment, and sanctioning of crimes. In the last decades, reforms have been implemented in several European countries. In Belgium for example, there was the so-called Octopus reform in 1998. The police was restructured leading to an integration of the police forces on a national and local level. New steering instruments were introduced, such as regional security plans. With regard to the sanctioning of crimes, a new institution was installed, called the sentence implementation court. This book evaluates these reforms and discusses the current reform on the reorganisation of the judicial landscape. In addition, it examines the relation between trust and distrust and the application to the judicial system. It discusses the human capital aspect of the system, by means of a study on the proposography of the Belgian magistrates that analyses the Magistracy as socio-professional group, and focuses on situations of system building, transformations under constraint (occupation) and transfers (colonial experience). Lastly, the book presents a comparative study of Belgium and France regarding the new techniques and instruments that are needed to accelerate the judicial response time and to ensure that the judicial system delivers its services on time. nrpages: XVIII, 275 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Qualitative-comparative {{analysis}} of four cases of inter-organisational information sharing in <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>chains</b> demonstrates the causal asymmetry between successful and unsuccessful inter-organisational information sharing.

By triggering the radical restructuring of information-sharing workflows, good project management and compatible technologies set in motion underlying mechanisms that generate successful inter-organisational information sharing.

The research suggests that students choose <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> careers in part because their personal philosophies mirror the conflicting objectives of the <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> system. <b>Criminal</b> <b>justice</b> education seems to influence <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> student views of the <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> system, but {{in a direction that}} may make the transition to employment in <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> agencies a more difficult process.

40|$|Two {{trends are}} present in both {{the private and public}} domain: {{increasing}} interorganisational co-operation and increasing digitisation. More and more processes within and between organisations take place electronically, on local, national and European scale. The technological and organisational issues related to this prove to be difficult on a local scale and barely manageable on national and European scales. We introduce the theoretical framework of Chain-computerisation, which explains large-scale chain co-operation as an answer to a dominant chain problem. Identity fraud proves to be the dominant chain problem in many chain co-operation situations. Therefore, our main research question is: how to arrive at a successful information strategy to combat identity fraud in the large-scale processes that constitute the public domain? We demonstrate the problem of identity fraud on the basis of two Dutch cases, from the <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>chain</b> and the healthcare sector. These cases are taken from our chain research programme in which we test empirical findings against the theoretical framework of Chain-computerisation to derive a successful chain-specific information strategy. In both cases, the problem of identity fraud presents a threat to the chain co-operation. Identity fraud has to be tackled with an approach focused on large-scale processes and with specific person-oriented security procedures and instruments preventing identity fraud from happening undetected. This study forms an important contribution to information science and to the security realm that still pivots only on traditional authentication frameworks that cannot cope with ‘wrong person’ identity fraud. In large-scale situations, therefore, additional safeguards will be necessary. Taking into account that the problem of identity fraud rises in many other domains and countries as well, we conclude that it is a major threat to the European society. Finally, we argue that chain-specific information systems with random identity verification enable combating identity fraud...|$|E
40|$|Two {{trends are}} present in both {{the private and public}} domain: {{increasing}} interorganisational co-operation and increasing digitisation. Nowadays, more and more processes within and between organisations take place electronically. These developments are visible on local, national and European scale. Research, strategy and policy often focus on the technological issues, whereas the organisational issues are complex and important as well. These issues prove to be difficult on a local scale and barely manageable on national and European scales, because the number of parties increases greatly and because of differences in culture, legislation and IT infrastructure. We introduce the theoretical framework of Chain-computerisation that explains large-scale chain co-operation as an answer to a dominant chain problem. Identity fraud proves to be the dominant chain problem in many chain co-operation situations. Therefore, our main research question is: what is a successful information strategy to combat identity fraud in the large-scale processes that constitute the public domain? Next, we demonstrate the problem of identity fraud using the example of the Dutch <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>chain,</b> showing that a certain chain communication system enables to stop identity fraud using forensic biometrics. The second example is about healthcare. In the Netherlands, the government is introducing a national system of medical information exchange based on the national personal number as the sole identifier for recognition and linking. We show that people sometimes have interest in using somebody else’s number, to be treated in cases (s) he is not insured. This identity fraud can contaminate medical records on a national scale. We ponder about infrastructural elements that enable international exchange of medical information on a European scale and ask ourselves which additional safeguards will be necessary on this enormous scale. The examples are taken from our chain analysis programme that has an exploratory, empirical character. A chain analysis tests empirical findings against the theoretical framework of Chain-computerisation, to derive a suitable chain-specific information strategy. We use this novel approach which is specifically tailored to the peculiarities of large-scale situations, as opposed to the small-scale approach usually employed in these cases. The traditional authentication procedures do not take into account ‘wrong person’ identity fraud that causes fraud surreptitiously spreading from chain to chain. Therefore, in both cases, the problem of identity fraud presents a threat to the chain co-operation that has to be tackled with a large-scale approach and with person-oriented security procedures and instruments that are indeed able to prevent identity fraud from happening undetected. It is precisely this approach and this type of procedures and instruments that are explained here. This is a novel contribution to information science and to the security realm that still pivots only on traditional authentication frameworks. Taking into account that it is probable that the problem of identity fraud rises in many other domains and countries as well, we conclude that identity fraud is a major threat to the European society. Finally, we argue that an information strategy using basic, but chain-specific information systems, combined with random identity verification procedures enable combating identity fraud...|$|E
