5|$|The Banglapedia project {{originated}} {{when the}} Asiatic Society of Bangladesh {{was working on}} a three-volume study titled History of Bangladesh, 1704-1971 in 1991. The editors felt the need for a standard desk reference, as that project progressed laboriously, culling facts from various libraries. The idea finally led to a <b>concept</b> <b>paper</b> prepared by Sirajul Islam and his colleagues and submitted to the Asiatic Society of Bangladesh in early 1994. The Banglapedia project was formally adopted on 19 February 1997, and Islam was appointed project director and chief editor. As the head of the Project Implementation Committee, his task was to plan and manage the project funding. In 1996, some three dozen committees were formed with three to four people in each committee to recommend the entries. Twenty-seven thousand entries were proposed, requiring a 20 volume compendium. Because of financial constraints, the number of entries was cut down to around 6,000. The project officially took off in 1998.|$|E

The proposed contingency force {{was approved by}} NATO in December 1967 and activated in January 1968 as Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT).|$|E
25|$|The Development <b>Concept</b> <b>Paper</b> {{examined}} performance, schedule, cost estimates, {{and technical}} risks {{to provide a}} basis for determining whether to begin or continue a research and development program. But in practice, what it proved to be was a cost burden that became a barrier to entry for companies attempting to deal with the military. It aided the trend toward a few large non-competitive defense contractors serving the military. Rather than serving any useful purpose, the overhead necessary to generate information that was often in practice ignored resulted in increased costs throughout the system.|$|E

25|$|Among the {{management}} tools developed to implement PPBS were the Five Year Defense Plan (FYDP), the Draft Presidential Memorandum (DPM), the Readiness, Information and Control Tables, and the Development <b>Concept</b> <b>Paper</b> (DCP). The annual FYDP {{was a series}} of tables projecting forces for eight years and costs and manpower for five years in mission-oriented, rather than individual service, programs. By 1968, the FYDP covered ten military areas: strategic forces, general purpose forces, intelligence and communications, airlift and sealift, guard and reserve forces, research and development, central supply and maintenance, training and medical services, administration and related activities, and support of other nations.|$|E
2500|$|Cass's last {{published}} {{paper was}} [...] "Compatible beliefs and equilibrium" [...] (2008, J. Math. Econ. 44, 625-640) [...] Cass describes this paper as a <b>concept</b> <b>paper,</b> {{in which he}} goes back to the primitives of economic theory and asks what beliefs economic agents must hold in order to justify the conventional assumption of competitive equilibrium. [...] Cass's last paper, [...] "Utility-based utility" [...] was under revision {{at the time of his}} death. [...] This paper is also conceptual in nature in showing that sunspot equilibria could exist under weaker specifications of preferences than the standard von Neumann-Morgenstern specification.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1984, he {{and several}} CSIRO senior staff members, {{and a senior}} {{engineering}} manager from BHP, met to discuss a <b>concept</b> <b>paper.</b> On the day before Good Friday, they agreed on the components and who would write them. They all had commitments and agreed it would take six weeks to put a draft together. [...] However, such was their private enthusiasm that each of them worked right through the four-day break, virtually finishing their drafts. In July 1984 the completed work was published as A Proposal for a Fast Railway between Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne. It turned the high-speed train from a broad concept to a tangible proposal, remarkably predicting the main issues that {{would be involved in}} the development of an Australian high-speed railway.|$|E

[...] As a term defined by the Bahá'í International Community in a <b>concept</b> <b>paper</b> shared at the 1st session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development, New York, U.S.A. on 14–25 June 1993. [...] "World citizenship begins with an acceptance of the oneness of the human family and the interconnectedness of the nations of 'the earth, our home.' While it encourages a sane and legitimate patriotism, it also insists upon a wider loyalty, a love of humanity as a whole. It does not, however, imply abandonment of legitimate loyalties, the suppression of cultural diversity, the abolition of national autonomy, nor the imposition of uniformity. Its hallmark is 'unity in diversity.' World citizenship encompasses the principles {{of social and economic}} justice, both within and between nations; non-adversarial decision making at all levels of society; equality of the sexes; racial, ethnic, national and religious harmony; and the willingness to sacrifice for the common good. Other facets of world citizenship—including the promotion of human honour and dignity, understanding, amity, co-operation, trustworthiness, compassion and the desire to serve—can be deduced from those already mentioned." ...|$|E

5000|$|Many of the [...] "criteria" [...] {{used by the}} Review Committee are imprecise and {{how they}} might be {{consistently}} applied across all concept papers is unclear. It is not known if {{all members of the}} Review Committee collaborate on scoring each <b>Concept</b> <b>Paper,</b> or if each reviewer scores several papers on his or her own. The latter case could result in increased disparity in the application of the criteria. The answers to most questions appear to simply be taken from the applicant's statements in the <b>Concept</b> <b>Paper</b> being evaluated, with no verification of accuracy. Further, the answers to some criteria seem like they should result in the disqualification of a <b>Concept</b> <b>Paper,</b> rather than just being part of its overall score.|$|E
