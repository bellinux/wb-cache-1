50|$|A geared <b>continuous</b> <b>hinge</b> {{is a type}} of <b>continuous</b> <b>hinge</b> used {{mostly on}} doors in {{high-traffic}} entrances and features gear teeth that mesh together under a cap that runs the length of the hinge. The hinges use a number of fasteners to attach the door to the frame from top to bottom to distribute a door’s weight more evenly along the frame to stop doors from sagging. They are often used in schools, hospitals, hotels, offices, airports, stadiums, storefronts and many other commercial and industrial buildings.|$|E
40|$|Supported through {{technological}} advances, {{the concept}} of kinetic architecture is internationally increasingly acknowledged in the past years {{in the development of}} adaptable buildings as to differing functional requirements, or external loading conditions. Most decisive factor is the structure in terms of materials and geometrical configurations, and the control system integrated within. Based on general principles of tensegrity structures, a hybrid system has been developed that consists of <b>continuous</b> <b>hinge</b> connected compression members, strengthened by an internal system of struts and continuous cable diagonals with closed loop. The kinetic mechanism is achieved through alteration of the cables length and the respective relative inclination of any adjacent compression members. In this way the transformability of the system arises primarily from the inherent integrative composition and dual capabilities of its members. Following the construction design of the prototype structure, the interactive development, as regards geometric properties and structural configurations, is presented analytically, as based on a parametric-associative design approach applied. Along this line, the specific syntax of structural development and simulation through parametric design is suggested to support in real terms the control design of the innovative structure in an integrated interactive context...|$|E

50|$|Folding Boat Equipment was {{developed}} in 1928 and went through several versions until it was used in WW2 to compliment the Bailey Pontoon. It had a <b>continuous</b> canvas <b>hinge</b> and could fold flat for storage and transportation. When assembled it could carry 15 men and with two boats and some additional toppings it could transport a 3-ton truck. Further upgrades during WW2 resulted in it moving to a Class 9 bridge.|$|R
25|$|Engineers in {{the nineteenth}} century {{understood}} that a bridge that was continuous across multiple supports would distribute the loads among them. This would result in lower stresses in the girder or truss and meant that longer spans could be built. Several nineteenth century engineers patented <b>continuous</b> bridges with <b>hinge</b> points mid-span. The use of a hinge in the multi-span system presented the advantages of a statically determinate system and of a bridge that could handle differential settlement of the foundations. Engineers could more easily calculate the forces and stresses with a hinge in the girder.|$|R
40|$|Health {{analysis}} {{often involves}} prediction of multiple outcomes of mixed-type. Existing work is restrictive {{to either a}} limited number or specific outcome types. We propose a framework for mixed-type multi-outcome prediction. Our proposed framework proposes a cumulative loss function composed of a specific loss function for each outcome type - as an example, least square (<b>continuous</b> outcome), <b>hinge</b> (binary outcome), poisson (count outcome) and exponential (non-negative outcome). Tomodel these outcomes jointly, we impose a commonality across the prediction parameters through a common matrix-Normal prior. The framework is formulated as iterative optimization problems and solved using an efficient Block coordinate descent method (BCD). We empirically demonstrate both scalability and convergence. We apply the proposed model to a synthetic dataset and then on two real-world cohorts: a Cancer cohort and an Acute Myocardial Infarction cohort collected over a two year period. We predict multiple emergency related outcomes - as example, future emergency presentations (binary), emergency admissions (count), emergency length-of-stay-days (non-negative) and emergency time-to-next-admission-day (non-negative). Weshow that the predictive performance of the proposed model is better than several state-of-the-art baselines...|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} is a ply shell, ovoid {{in cross}} section and built around a series of frames and stringers. The tandem seats are enclosed ahead of the wing leading edge under a starboard <b>hinged,</b> <b>continuous</b> canopy. The Bonaventura has no wheeled undercarriage, but took off from a wheeled, drop-off dolly and landed on a simple, rubber sprung skid extending from nose to mid chord, aided by a sprung tail skid. The fuselage becomes slim towards the tail, where the double straight tapered horizontal tail is mounted on top of it, far enough forward that its trailing edge is at the rudder hinge. The elevators are fabric covered and the starboard one carries a trim tab. Fin and rudder are also straight tapered and the tall, fabric covered, unbalanced rudder reaches down to the keel.|$|R
40|$|General Practitioners {{and mental}} health clinicians {{recognise}} and acknowledge the expertise of psychologists in the diagnosis {{and management of the}} full range of mental health problems. This presentation highlights the challenges of recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of psychologists by a particular service provider, while also outlining a particularly effective strategy implemented over the past decade. Continuing difficulties are identified with some options suggested as part solutions. Data is presented illustrating the scope of the challenges faced: nature and extent of mental health problems; scale of demand and geographic are covered; comparative research involving other service providers. The organisation has been recruiting and employing qualified and experienced psychologists for South West Queensland region for the past 13 years. The challenge to the organisation to offer effective and <b>continuous</b> services <b>hinges</b> on the difficulties of recruitment and retention of staff in these areas. The practice of sponsoring psychologists from abroad, who meet the standards of the Australian Psychological Society as well as the Queensland Board of Psychology, has proven to be an effective strategy. This has allowed for effective service delivery in this region as described by the community, GPs and consumers in a recent survey. Service delivery remains a challenge due to numerous reasons to be explored. Of particular note is the challenge of managing a situation in which overseastrained psychologists with a particular cultural orientation are required to serve an ever changing multi-cultural population in the South West Queensland region. A future based exploration of ways to support these psychologists—personally and professionally — whilst delivering an effective service within this multicultural environment is outlined...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{important}} challenges in real time process management is the implementation of intelligent systems that can assist human operators in making control decisions. Modern technological advances have resulted in increasingly complicated processes that present considerable challenges in their design, analysis and management for successful operation. Given the size, scope, and complexity of these modern engineered systems and their interactions, {{it is becoming increasingly}} difficult for people to anticipate, diagnose and control serious abnormal events in a timely manner. Failure of the operator to exercise the appropriate mitigation actions often has an adverse effect on the product quality, process safety, occupational health and environment. Hence, there exist considerable incentives to develop intelligent systems for automating fault diagnosis and mitigation. The difficulties associated with implementing intelligent control and the opportunities for improvements are even greater in the pharmaceutical manufacturing domain due to processing challenges. Most pharmaceutical manufacturing involves particulate matter and the behaviors of particles are not well defined. ^ Traditionally the pharmaceutical industry has employed batch manufacturing, but the recent encouragement of the industry by the FDA to modernize manufacturing, has provided the impetus to move towards continuous manufacturing. However, the paradigm shift to <b>continuous</b> processing <b>hinges</b> critically on real time online measurement of Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) and hence on the development of rational approaches for sensor network design. Moreover, the industry is pushing for real time release of the drug products and it is of critical importance that the quality attributes can be monitored online. In addition, the number of process variable that are measured determines the strength of the diagnostic framework. Hence, various sensing schemes has been developed to monitor the process online. NIR spectroscopy along with Microwave sensing is used to monitor content uniformity of the blend and ribbon density and moisture content of the ribbons. However, the use of intensive online measurement schemes is new to the pharmaceutical industry and thus both the industry and the FDA are on a learning curve on how to deploy this technology effectively. Since, product quality is the main issue in pharmaceutical manufacturing, one way to build confidence in on-line measurement of CQA 2 ̆ 7 s is to use multiple sensors across the process train even for monitoring the same CQA at a given point in the train. However, cost considerations dictate that sensor network design strategies need {{to strike a balance between}} benefit and cost. At present, there has been no clear cut approach on sensor network design in the pharma manufacturing setting, which includes sensor placement and number of sensors to be used for the measurement of any given quality attribute. ^ In this work, an approach to sensor network design for continuous tablet production is studied along with development and application of Intelligent Alarm System (IAS) framework to the manufacturing process. The designed control system consists of: i) low-level or regulatory control and ii) Exceptional Event Management (EEM) module. The regulatory control tries to keep the controlled process variable at a specified value. Limitations to regulatory control were found in dealing with certain exceptional events where it exacerbates the situation instead of controlling it. The EEM module forms the top layer and helps to mitigate exceptional events that are missed by regulatory control. The control layers along with the knowledge management system forms the complete package of IAS. ^ Numerous abnormal events were studied by simulating the situation in the lab and faults signatures and trends were stored in the knowledge database along with the corresponding mitigation strategy. The framework developed was able to detect and diagnose various common abnormal events, including those involving a single process unit, multiple units, and controller and material faults. The study includes consideration of sensor placement for the on-line measurement of various quality attributes on the continuous manufacturing line and the benefit associated with redundant sensors. A value of information analysis is presented to calculate the additional benefit associated with multiple sensors on a given node of the sensor network. The methodology developed is general, includes identical and non-identical sensors on the network, and calculates the value for all sensor combination across the node. A data-driven model is derived to relate various quality parameters across multiple nodes. The analysis is expanded to include values from multiple nodes to provide the system wide value gained by having redundant sensors at different nodes. The results from the study are used to determine the optimal number of sensors on a node and can be used to carry out the economic and performance analysis. ...|$|R
