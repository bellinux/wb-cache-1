40|$|Is {{business}} ethics relevant to business? How can studying {{business ethics}} change behaviour in business? What’s {{the connection between}} business ethics (or applied ethics generally) and ethical theory? <b>Case</b> <b>Histories</b> in Business Ethics reflects upon, illustrates and extends the role of <b>case</b> <b>histories</b> (summaries of real cases) and case studies (which may be wholly or partly imaginary stories) in the teaching and studying of busi-ness ethics. This volume features contributions from Lord Borrie, Sir Adrian Cadbury, Jon Entine and John Edmonds. It explores the role of <b>case</b> <b>histories</b> in developing and generating argument in business ethics, and shows that both better understanding and better practice in business ethics require attention to ethical theory {{as well as to}} <b>case</b> <b>histories.</b> Also addressed is the use of <b>case</b> <b>histories</b> in engaging the widest range of student capacities, affective as well as cognitive, which directly affect the development of character. The connections between virtue theory and possible uses for <b>case</b> <b>histories</b> are also explained, as well as the potential use of new ways of developing case studies, such as through the use of information technologies, in the acquisition of virtues and transferable skills...|$|R

25|$|Some {{characteristics}} of stuttered speech {{are not as}} easy for listeners to detect. As a result, diagnosing stuttering requires the skills of a certified speech-language pathologist (SLP). Diagnosis of stuttering employs information both from direct observation {{of the individual and}} information about the individual’s background, through a <b>case</b> <b>history.</b> Information from both sources should span multiple, various settings and times. The SLP may collect a <b>case</b> <b>history</b> on the individual through a detailed interview or conversation with the parents (if client is a child). They may also observe parent-child interactions and observe the speech patterns of the child's parents. The overall goal of assessment for the SLP will be (1) to determine whether a speech disfluency exists, and (2) assess if its severity warrants concern for further treatment.|$|E

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to develop {{a measure of the}} {{referral}} behaviour of general practitioners, 21 simulated <b>case</b> <b>histories</b> were constructed which presented between three and six stages at which a decision was required whether or not refer a 'patient' to hospital. Twenty general practitioners completed the <b>case</b> <b>histories</b> and their responses were compared with their referral rates to outpatient departments. No significant correlations were found between the doctors' responses to the vignettes and their actual referral rates, and the repeatability of the vignettes was disappointing. The fact that the <b>case</b> <b>histories</b> appeared realistic to the doctors who completed them was not reflected in objective measures of their validity. Simulated <b>case</b> <b>histories</b> should not be used as a method of measuring doctors' behaviour without establishing their validity and reliability...|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{three key}} areas of visual communication we address in user interfaces (UIs) :. Information access and navigation. Icon recognition. Visual appeal or "look-and-feel" The article uses five <b>case</b> <b>histories</b> {{to demonstrate how}} usability research has helped the authors evaluate the quality of visual communication in navigation, icon recognition, and look-and-feel. It describes {{some of the research}} methodology the authors use, with examples from the <b>case</b> <b>histories.</b> For each of the three topic areas, we discuss the lessons we learned from the <b>case</b> <b>histories</b> about both usability testing methodology and visual communication guidelines. We mention, but do not concentrate on, related topics such as visual clutter. The <b>case</b> <b>histories</b> are all from laboratory-based usability testing with representatives of the target audiences.

25|$|Initial {{psychiatric}} {{assessment of}} a person typically begins with a <b>case</b> <b>history</b> and mental status examination. Physical examinations and psychological tests may be conducted. On occasion, neuroimaging or other neurophysiological techniques are used. Mental disorders are often diagnosed in accordance with criteria listed in diagnostic manuals such as the widely used Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), edited and used by the World Health Organization (WHO). The fifth edition of the DSM (DSM-5) was published in 2013, and its development {{was expected to be}} of significant interest to many medical fields.|$|E
25|$|During direct {{observation}} of the client, the SLP will observe {{various aspects of the}} individual’s speech behaviors. In particular, the therapist might test for factors including the types of disfluencies present (using a test such as the Dysfluency Type Index (DTI)), their frequency and duration (number of iterations, percentage of syllables stuttered (%SS)), and speaking rate (syllables per minute (SPM), words per minute (WPM)). They may also test for naturalness and fluency in speaking (naturalness rating scale (NAT), test of childhood stuttering (TOCS)) and physical concomitants during speech (Riley’s Stuttering Severity Instrument Fourth Edition (SSI-4)). They might also employ a test to evaluate the severity of the stuttering and predictions for its course. One such test includes the stuttering prediction instrument for young children (SPI), which analyzes the child’s <b>case</b> <b>history,</b> part-word repetitions and prolongations, and stuttering frequency {{in order to determine the}} severity of the disfluency and its prognosis for chronicity for the future.|$|E
25|$|In Germany, a {{relatively}} new law, which {{has been established in}} 2013, strengthens the rights of patients. It states, amongst other things, the statutory duty of medical personnel to document the treatment of the patient in either hard copy or within the electronic patient record (EPR). This documentation must happen in a timely manner and encompass each and every form of treatment the patient receives, as well as other necessary information, such as the patient’s <b>case</b> <b>history,</b> diagnoses, findings, treatment results, therapies and their effects, surgical interventions and their effects, as well as informed consents. The information must include virtually everything that is of functional importance for the actual, but also for future treatment. This documentation must also include the medical report and must be archived by the attending physician for at least 10 years. The law clearly states that these records are not only memory aids for the physicians, but also should be kept for the patient and must be presented on request.|$|E

500|$|The Hippocratic School gave {{importance}} to the clinical doctrines of observation and documentation. These doctrines dictate that physicians record their findings and their medicinal methods in a very clear and objective manner, so that these records may be passed down and employed by other physicians. Hippocrates made careful, regular note of many symptoms including complexion, pulse, fever, pains, movement, and excretions. He {{is said to have}} measured a patient's pulse when taking a <b>case</b> <b>history</b> to discover whether the patient was lying. Hippocrates extended clinical observations into family history and environment. [...] "To him medicine owes the art of clinical inspection and observation." [...] For this reason, he may more properly be termed as the [...] "Father of Medicine".|$|E
500|$|Marshall then {{addressed}} the Commerce Clause issues, {{and the argument}} of the Solicitor General that {{the section of the}} Commerce Clause that dealt directly with Indians applied rather than the argument of the oil companies that the section dealing with interstate commerce applied. [...] First, Marshall noted that the <b>case</b> <b>history</b> of the Indian Commerce Clause was to protect the tribes from state infringement, not to approve of Indian trade without constitutional restraint. [...] He saw of no reason to begin now, especially since he did not find that the tribe's severance tax did not have negative implications on interstate commerce. [...] In a 6-3 decision, Marshall found that the tribe had the right to impose such a tax on non-Indians.|$|E
500|$|Thomas's {{work and}} stature {{as a poet}} have been much debated by critics and biographers since his death. Critical studies have been clouded by Thomas's {{personality}} and mythology, especially his drunken persona and death in New York. When Seamus Heaney gave an Oxford lecture on the poet he opened by addressing the assembly, [...] "Dylan Thomas is now as much a <b>case</b> <b>history</b> as a chapter {{in the history of}} poetry", querying how 'Thomas the Poet' is one of his forgotten attributes. David Holbrook, who has written three books about Thomas, stated in his 1962 publication Llareggub Revisited, [...] "the strangest feature of Dylan Thomas's notoriety-not that he is bogus, but that attitudes to poetry attached themselves to him which not only threaten the prestige, effectiveness and accessibility to English poetry, but also destroyed his true voice and, at last, him." [...] The Poetry Archive notes that [...] "Dylan Thomas's detractors accuse him of being drunk on language as well as whiskey, but whilst there's no doubt that the sound of language is central to his style, he was also a disciplined writer who re-drafted obsessively".|$|E
