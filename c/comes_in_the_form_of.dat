5|$|Related to weapon {{dances and}} war dances is {{the dance of}} the hunt. A very early {{reference}} to a weapon dance of the hunt <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a rock engraving at Çatal Höyük, the large neolithic settlement in south-central Anatolia. It depicts a hunting ritual involving dancers holding their bows; one figure has a bow in each hand, two perform artistic leaps and another holds a horn-shaped stick and is striking a frame drum.|$|E
5|$|Combat <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> both avoidable random {{encounters}} and scripted fights {{where the}} camera is fixed within the fighting area: enemies and bosses are primarily drawn from Japanese folklore and mythology. Battles are triggered only when enemies are near, with the player character otherwise keeping their weapons sheathed. In combat, characters attack and guard using a single-button prompt, while another button accesses items such as healing potions. Continuously attacking triggers combos. Different moves include sword slashes combined with directional buttons, which have different effects such as throwing an enemy into the air with an upward slash. Additional offensive items such as smoke bombs are acquired {{during the course of}} the game. At the end of each battle, experience points are awarded to the player character depending on how fast the battle was finished: leveling up increases a character's health, stats, and the amount of damage inflicted upon enemies.|$|E
5|$|His parents imbue {{him with}} a strong moral compass during his {{formative}} years and warn him never to use his great strength in anger. However, during kindergarten, Danner nearly kills the school's bully in a one-sided fight after being assaulted by the child. This event brands him as an outsider {{in the eyes of}} the other children. Because they treat him with such abhorrence, his only solace <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> unleashing his powers within the Colorado wilderness (uprooting trees, throwing huge boulders, leaping to the mountain tops, etc.). This stigma eventually wears off, though, and is forgotten by the time Danner enters high school.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} acids {{containing}} chalcogens, including sulfuric acid, sulfurous acid, selenic acid, and telluric acid. All hydrogen chalcogenides are toxic except for water. Oxygen ions often <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> of oxide ions (...) , peroxide ions (...) , and hydroxide ions (...) [...] Sulfur ions generally <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> of sulfides (...) , sulfites (...) , sulfates (...) , and thiosulfates (...)

5|$|Some parasites feed on giraffes. They {{are often}} hosts for ticks, {{especially}} {{in the area around}} the genitals, which has thinner skin than other areas. Tick species that commonly feed on giraffes are those of genera Hyalomma, Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus. Giraffes may rely on red-billed and yellow-billed oxpeckers to clean them of ticks and alert them to danger. Giraffes host numerous species of internal parasite and are susceptible to various diseases. They were victims of the (now eradicated) viral illness rinderpest. Giraffes can also suffer from a skin disorder, which <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> wrinkles, lesions or raw fissures. It appears to be caused by a nematode and may be further effected by fungal infections. As much as 79% of giraffes show signs of the disease in Ruaha National Park.|$|E

25|$|Today, to {{meet the}} demands of modern {{business}} and to compete with road transportation, operations continue to be enhanced, and much traffic <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> bulk cargo from large customers. Although passenger services no longer exist, the future of long-distance bulk freight on the line appears secure and the Main South Line is an important link in New Zealand's transport infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|Turbulence {{models can}} be {{classified}} based on computational expense, which corresponds to the range of scales that are modeled versus resolved (the more turbulent scales that are resolved, the finer {{the resolution of the}} simulation, and therefore the higher the computational cost). If a majority or all of the turbulent scales are not modeled, the computational cost is very low, but the tradeoff <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> decreased accuracy.|$|E

25|$|Since the twin-turbo V6 engine {{occupies}} {{almost as}} much space as their 3-cylinder engines, the fuel tank had to be relocated to {{the nose of the}} car, where a luggage compartment used to be.

The bigger engine also forced a change from separate coil springs and dampers to concentric units to support the de Dion rear suspension.|$|E
25|$|Although timber barons orchestrate {{the illicit}} operations, {{including}} export, their operations are financed by international sources. This financing <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> down payments {{of up to}} half the total sale from foreign buyers and loans from international banks that have branches in Antananarivo. The loans are critical, even in such a profitable industry, because without full payment, most of the capital gets {{tied up in the}} stockpiles of logs waiting to be exported.|$|E
25|$|The game {{contains}} many hidden collectable items. Some are entries from the player's diary, revealing {{more about his}} backstory.

25|$|Another {{possible}} {{design for}} the roof {{is suggested by the}} slightly earlier Trajan's Column, where watchtowers are shown with hipped (or pyramidal) roofs. In this design, a balcony is shown below the roof, acting as the observation platform. To maintain the equivalent viewing height as the flat roofed design, this design would necessitate a slightly higher tower. Physical evidence supporting this design <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> both roof tiles fragments in a few turrets, and slates in some others.|$|E
25|$|The team wore {{a uniform}} which was {{inspired}} by their 1957–58 jersey for the 2015 NHL Winter Classic. This uniform is nearly identical to the road uniform that the Blackhawks currently wear. The main differences between this design and the current road design <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> the lace up collar, the name/number block font (which is serifed), and the C-Tomahawk logo, which is mostly red, black, and white (with a tad bit of yellow) instead of being mostly red, yellow, green black and white.|$|E
25|$|Aid <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> {{the demon}} Neron; Luthor is offered full health in {{exchange}} for services and his soul.

Convincing Cukata he has no wish to come between them, Cuff persuades him to help him escape instead. Accordingly, Cukata spirits Cuff out and provides him transportation {{in the form of}} Soga, one of a herd of mutated crocodiles the tribe retains as mounts. He also tells him where he can find Hickey's machine.|$|E
25|$|The Kingdom of Jerusalem {{lasted until}} 1291; however, Jerusalem itself was recaptured by Saladin in 1187 (see Siege of Jerusalem (1187)), who {{permitted}} worship of all religions. According to Rabbi Elijah of Chelm, German Jews lived in Jerusalem during the 11th century. The {{story is told}} that a German-speaking Jew saved {{the life of a}} young German man surnamed Dolberger. Thus when the knights of the First Crusade came to besiege Jerusalem, one of Dolberger's family members rescued Jews in Palestine and carried them back to the German city of Worms to repay the favor. Further evidence of German communities in the holy city <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> halakic questions sent from Germany to Jerusalem {{during the second half of}} the 11th century.|$|E
25|$|Although Skins {{aired in}} the United States on BBC America (only series 1–3 aired {{and the rights}} cleared only for those series for {{purchase}} of DVDs or online viewing in the US), albeit in an edited form (strong language bleeped out and some more graphic scenes of violence and sex cut out), MTV announced {{that they would be}} adapting the show into an American version set in Baltimore, Maryland. With Bryan Elsley as executive producer, the series began filming in February 2010 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The first episode of the US series is almost a shot-for-shot copy of the first episode of the UK series, but it deviates from the original plot in following episodes such that there are significant differences between the US and UK versions. Characters are also similar, and some names have been changed; Sid has been renamed Stanley, Cassie renamed Cadie and Jal renamed Daisy. In addition, Tony's younger sister Effy, who becomes a main character in Generation Two of UK Skins, was renamed Eura. However, the biggest change <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> Tea, a lesbian cheerleader who replaces the UK gay character Maxxie who was a professional dancer.|$|E
