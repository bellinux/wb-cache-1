5000|$|One {{theory on}} the origin of Mima mounds is that they were created by small {{burrowing}} rodents such as pocket gophers (Thomomys talpoides) of the endemic North American family Geomyidae. Researchers in the 1940s found that Mima mounds tend to form in areas with poorly draining soils, so the [...] "Fossorial Rodent Hypothesis" [...] proposed that gophers build mounds as an evolutionary response to low water tables. It could be argued that gophers live in the mounds opportunistically but did not build them. Metal tracers implanted in a Mima mound field in San Diego demonstrated that gophers unexpectedly pushed soil upwards towards the center of the mounds instead of pushing the soil downward. This uphill soil transport contrasts with the typical gopher behavior of pushing soil downhill but can be overridden when soil is saturated. Consequently, gophers in mima mound fields seem to be aware of randomly distributed topographic highs and orient their burrowing accordingly in early mound creation stages. However, the mounds were already fully formed and the gophers may have just been maintaining them. Nevertheless, the fact that the surface area of a typical Mima mound is similar to the size of an individual gopher's home range is consistent with the theory they were constructed by the rodents. Results from the tracer study were incorporated into a numerical model that simulated the burrowing behavior of gophers. The advantage of modelling in this case is that (1) an initially flat surface can be specified, and (2) time can be sped up. In the computer simulations, mounds naturally emerged from randomly distributed topographic highs, and reached topographic steady state after several centuries of gopher activity, which could explain why nobody has ever witnessed the growth of one. Once the mound field reaches topographic maturity, the mounds feature more uniform spacing and hexagonal tessellation. Results indicated that formation of these mound fields are largely contributed by positive feedback loops which amplify small features to create large scale patterns, a <b>common</b> <b>facet</b> of self-organization. The slow modeled mound growth rates and their spatial distribution agreed with field observations. Although occupation of mounds by gophers does not by itself prove that gophers built the mounds since they could be living there opportunistically, to date, this is the strongest evidence for the origin of these enigmatic features.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. <b>Common</b> <b>facets</b> of {{religion}} are those aspects {{of religion}} that can be shared by people from any racial group. In contrast, unique facets of religion are available only to people in specific racial groups. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the interface among <b>common</b> <b>facets</b> of religion, unique facets of religion, and life satisfaction in a nationwide sample of older Black people. Methods. Interviews were conducted with a nationally representative sample of older African Americans. Survey items were administered to assess common religious factors (e. g., the frequency of church attendance) and unique religious factors (i. e., the belief that religion sustains Black people in the face of racial adversity). Subjective well-being was measured with a life satisfaction index. Results. The findings reveal that both the common and the unique aspects of religion contribute to life satisfaction among older African Americans. Discussion. Most studies on race differences in religion focus solely on common religious factors that may enhance the subjective well-being of older Whites as well as older Blacks. The findings from this study are important because they call attention to the insight that can be obtained by also taking the unique facets of religion for older Black people into consideration. R ESEARCH indicates that involvement in religion may beassociated with better physical health and enhanced feelings of subjective well-being across the life course (Koenig, McCullough, & Larson, 2001). Moreover, this literature further reveals that older African Americans may be more likely than older Whites to enjoy these health-related benefits (Krause, 2002 a). Some investigators attribute these findings to the fact that older Blacks are more religious than older Whites (Levin, Taylor, & Chatters, 1994). So, for example, a number of studies reveal that older Blacks are more likely to go to church services, read the Bible, and pray than older Whites (Krause, 2003; Levin et al., 1994). This research also indicates that older Blacks are more likely than older Whites to receive informal social support from church members, and they are more likely to feel they have a closer relationship with God (Krause...|$|R

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Rapid {{progress}} in genetics {{has meant that}} there are now five genes identified for 'Parkinson's disease'. The detailed phenotypes vary, but generally the dominant genes cause a Lewy body disease spectrum whereas recessive genes cause a milder parkinsonism with variable inclusion body pathology. The subject of this review is to highlight these discoveries and to discuss their relationships to idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Recent findings In January 2004, mutations in PINK 1, coding for a mitochondrial kinase, were found to be causal for recessive parkinsonism. Subsequently, several studies have found additional mutations associated with early onset parkinsonism. Some cases have been described with a phenotype much closer to idiopathic Parkinson's disease, but it does not appear that PINK 1 is a major risk factor for the sporadic disease. Later in the same year, the LRRK 2 gene was shown to cause a dominant disease with a broader phenotype. The protein product was named dardarin and contains GTPase and kinase domains. Lewy bodies have been reported in LRRK 2 cases, potentially linking this gene with sporadic Parkinson's disease. One mutation, G 2019 S, is found in a significant percentage of cases, including sporadic Parkinson's disease. Summary Mutations in these two genes, along with previously described Mendelian variants, are beginning to yield important information about loss of specific neuronal groups or to protein inclusion pathology. How this relates to sporadic Parkinson's disease, however, is not yet fully defined. There are clear phenotypic overlaps with genetic and sporadic Parkinson's disease, especially for the dominant genes, suggesting that <b>common</b> <b>facets</b> of pathogenesis may exist...|$|R

40|$|Successful natural {{resource}} management {{is dependent on}} effective knowledge exchange and utilization. Local/traditional/indigenous knowledge derived from place-based experience and scientific knowledge generated by systematic inquiry are the most commonly recognized knowledge domains. However, we propose that many {{natural resource}} decisions are not based on local or scientific knowledge, but rather on a little recognized domain that we term professional ecological knowledge (PEK). Professional ecological knowledge is founded upon codification of broad ecological principles, but not necessarily scientific evidence, to legitimize agency programs, support operational efficiency, and encourage user compliance. However, {{in spite of these}} benefits, PEK may reduce program effectiveness by inhibiting the exchange of local and scientific knowledge and minimizing the development of evidence-based conservation. We describe what we consider to be <b>common</b> <b>facets</b> of PEK through case studies examining the sources of knowledge utilized by forestry agencies in India and by rangeland conservation programs of the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service. Three propositions are presented regarding the origins and continued existence of PEK: (1) minimal information feedbacks regarding the efficacy of agency programs contributes to development of PEK; (2) a narrow scientific agenda and a perception that most scientific knowledge is not relevant to management decisions encourages a divide between scientists and managers; and (3) political interests often benefit from existing applications of PEK. By calling attention to the existence of PEK as a distinctive knowledge domain, we aim to encourage more explicit and critical consideration of the origins of knowledge used in environmental decision making. Explicit recognition of PEK may provide greater understanding of the dynamics of knowledge exchange and decision making in natural resource management...|$|R
