5|$|Blast {{furnaces}} {{existed in}} China from about 1st century AD {{and in the}} West from the High Middle Ages. They spread from the region around Namur in Wallonia (Belgium) in the late 15th century, being introduced to England in 1491. The fuel used in these was invariably charcoal. The successful substitution of coke for charcoal is widely attributed to Abraham Darby in 1709. The efficiency of the process was further enhanced by the practice of preheating the <b>combustion</b> <b>air</b> (hot blast), patented by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828.|$|E

25|$|This is {{the main}} <b>combustion</b> <b>air.</b> It is highly {{compressed}} air from the high-pressure compressor (often decelerated via the diffuser) that is fed through the main channels in {{the dome of the}} combustor and the first set of liner holes.

40|$|Broad Funding Opportunity Announcement Project: MSU is {{developing}} a new engine for use in hybrid automobiles that could significantly reduce fuel waste and improve engine efficiency. In a traditional internal <b>combustion</b> engine, <b>air</b> and fuel are ignited, creating high-temperature and high-pressure gases which expand rapidly. This expansion of gases forces the engine’s pistons to pump and powers the car. MSU’s engine has no pistons. It uses the <b>combustion</b> of <b>air</b> and fuel to build up pressure within the engine, generating a shockwave that blasts hot gas exhaust into the blades of the engine’s rotors causing them to turn, which generates electricity.

40|$|Sour gas is an {{unconventional}} fuel consisting mainly of methane (CH₄), carbon dioxide (CO₂), and hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) that constitutes a considerable, currently untapped energy source. However, {{little is known}} about its combustion characteristics. In this work, we used our recently assembled and validated detailed chemical reaction mechanism to examine some of the combustion properties of sour gas with different compositions in both conventional <b>air</b> <b>combustion</b> and oxy-fuel combustion, the latter being motivated by application in carbon capture and storage. The calculations suggest that raising the H₂S content in the fuel leads to relatively small changes in the flame temperature and laminar burning velocity, but a considerable reduction in the ignition delay time. At elevated pressures, H₂O diluted oxy-fuel combustion leads to higher burning velocities than CO₂ diluted oxy-fuel <b>combustion</b> or <b>air</b> <b>combustion.</b> Mixed CH₄/H₂S flames exhibit a two-zone structure in which H₂S is oxidized completely to sulfur dioxide (SO₂) while CH₄ is converted to carbon monoxide (CO).

2500|$|Production {{of steel}} and other metals was {{hampered}} by the difficulty in producing sufficiently high temperatures for melting. [...] An understanding of thermodynamic principles such as recapturing heat from flue gas by preheating <b>combustion</b> <b>air,</b> known as hot blast, resulted in much higher energy efficiency and higher temperatures. [...] Preheated <b>combustion</b> <b>air</b> was used in iron production and in the open hearth furnace. [...] In 1780, before the introduction of hot blast in 1829, it required seven times as much coke as {{the weight of the}} product pig iron. [...] The hundredweight of coke per short ton of pig iron was 35 in 1900, falling to 13 in 1950. [...] By 1970 the most efficient blast furnaces used 10 hundredweight of coke per short ton of pig iron.|$|E
2500|$|This {{is because}} coal stoves are {{fitted with a}} grate so {{allowing}} part of the <b>combustion</b> <b>air</b> to be admitted below the fire. The proportion of air admitted above/below the fire depends {{on the type of}} coal. Brown coal and lignites [...] evolve more combustible gases than say anthracite and so need more air above the fire. The ratio of air above/below the fire must be carefully adjusted to enable complete combustion.|$|E
2500|$|In {{plants that}} burn {{pulverized}} coal, silos feed coal to pulverizers (coal mills) {{that take the}} larger [...] pieces, grind them to the consistency of talcum powder, sort them, and mix them with primary <b>combustion</b> <b>air</b> which transports the coal to the boiler furnace and preheats the coal in order to drive off excess moisture content.

Hexagonal single crystals are formed by <b>combustion</b> in <b>air</b> in a homogeneous magnetic field, and in case of aninhomogeneous magnetic field faceted elongated crystals of micron sizeare generated. The formation of elongated structure products is due to the mass transfer of the combustion products in the direction of thermal flows.

2500|$|The {{combustion}} flue gases {{inside the}} chimneys or stacks are much hotter than the ambient outside air and therefore less dense than the ambient air. That causes {{the bottom of}} the vertical column of hot flue gas to have a lower pressure than the pressure {{at the bottom of a}} corresponding column of outside air. That higher pressure outside the chimney is the driving force that moves the required <b>combustion</b> <b>air</b> into the combustion zone and also moves the flue gas up and out of the chimney. That movement or flow of <b>combustion</b> <b>air</b> and flue gas is called [...] "natural draught/draft", [...] "natural ventilation", [...] "chimney effect", or [...] "stack effect". The taller the stack, the more draught or draft is created. There can be cases of diminishing returns: if a stack is overly tall in relation to the heat being sent out of the stack, the flue gases may cool before reaching the top of the chimney. [...] This condition can result in poor drafting, and in the case of wood burning appliances, the cooling of the gases before emission can cause creosote to condense near the top of the chimney. The creosote can restrict the exit of flue gases and may pose a fire hazard.|$|E
2500|$|The {{efficiency}} of CCGT and GT can be boosted by pre-cooling <b>combustion</b> <b>air.</b> [...] This is practised in hot climates {{and also has}} the effect of increasing power output. This is achieved by evaporative cooling of water using a moist matrix placed in front of the turbine, or by using Ice storage air conditioning. [...] The latter has the advantage of greater improvements due to the lower temperatures available. [...] Furthermore, ice storage {{can be used as a}} means of load control or load shifting since ice can be made during periods of low power demand and, potentially in the future the anticipated high availability of other resources such as renewables during certain periods.|$|E
2500|$|Hot blast, {{patented}} by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828, {{was the most}} important development of the 19th century for saving energy in making pig iron. [...] By using waste exhaust heat to preheat <b>combustion</b> <b>air,</b> the amount of fuel to make a unit of pig iron was reduced at first by between one-third using coal or two-thirds using coke; however, the efficiency gains continued as the technology improved. [...] Hot blast also raised the operating temperature of furnaces, increasing their capacity. [...] Using less coal or coke meant introducing fewer impurities into the pig iron. [...] This meant that lower quality coal or anthracite could be used in areas where coking coal was unavailable or too expensive; however, {{by the end of the}} 19th century transportation costs fell considerably.|$|E
