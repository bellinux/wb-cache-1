5|$|In more derived {{orders of}} insects, such as Diptera (flies) and Hymenoptera (wasp), the {{indirect}} muscles occupy the greatest {{volume of the}} pterothorax and function as {{the primary source of}} power for the wingstroke. <b>Contraction</b> <b>of</b> the dorsolongitudinal muscles causes the severe arching of the notum which depresses the wing while <b>contraction</b> <b>of</b> the dorsoventral muscles causes opposite motion of notum. Other more primitive insects, such as Orthoptera (locusts), Coleoptera (beetles), and Odonata (dragonflies) use direct muscles that are responsible for developing the needed power for the up and down strokes.|$|E
5|$|Bats seem to {{make use}} of {{particularly}} strong venomotion, a rhythmic <b>contraction</b> <b>of</b> venous wall muscles. In most mammals, the walls of the veins provide mainly passive resistance, maintaining their shape as deoxygenated blood flows through them, but in bats they appear to actively support blood flow back to the heart with this pumping action. Due to their relatively small and lightweight bodies, bats are not at risk of blood flow rushing to their heads when roosting.|$|E
5|$|Central to this discussion, it was {{announced}} in 2009, that the radius of Betelgeuse had shrunk from 1993 to 2009 by 15%, with the 2008 angular measurement equal to 47.0mas, {{not too far from}} Perrin's estimate. Unlike most earlier papers, this study encompassed a 15-year period at one specific wavelength. Earlier studies have typically lasted one to two years by comparison and have explored multiple wavelengths, often yielding vastly different results. The diminution in Betelgeuse's apparent size equates to a range of values between 56.0±0.1mas seen in 1993 to 47.0±0.1mas seen in 2008—a <b>contraction</b> <b>of</b> almost 0.9AU in 15years. What is not fully known is whether this observation is evidence of a rhythmic expansion and <b>contraction</b> <b>of</b> the star's photosphere as astronomers have theorized, and if so, what the periodic cycle might be, although Townes suggested that if a cycle does exist, it is probably a few decades long. Other possible explanations are photospheric protrusions due to convection or a star that is not spherical but asymmetric causing the appearance of expansion and contraction as the star rotates on its axis.|$|E

5|$|A {{promethium}} atom has 61 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 4f56s2.

It is the only exception to the general trend of the <b>contraction</b> <b>of</b> the atoms with increase of atomic radius (caused by the lanthanide contraction) that is not caused by the filled (or half-filled) 4f-subshell.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} {{concept in}} Hippocratic medicine {{was that of}} a crisis, a point in the progression of disease at which either the illness would begin to triumph and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite would occur and natural processes would make the patient recover. After a crisis, a relapse might follow, and then another deciding crisis. According to this doctrine, crises tend to occur on critical days, which were supposed to be a fixed time after the <b>contraction</b> <b>of</b> a disease. If a crisis occurred on a day far from a critical day, a relapse might be expected. Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him.|$|E

Meanwhile, he and Geraci moved out of their crowded apartment into a new flat in Middle Village. Despite same-sex marriage not being legally recognised at the time, they undertook a private wedding ceremony to marry one another, although were non-monogamous, and would go together to gay bath houses to partake in sexual activity with other patrons, resulting in Buczynski's <b>contraction</b> <b>of</b> several sexually transmitted infections.|$|E
5|$|Calcium is an {{essential}} element needed in large quantities. The Ca2+ ion acts as an electrolyte and {{is vital to the}} health of the muscular, circulatory, and digestive systems; is indispensable to the building of bone; and supports synthesis and function of blood cells. For example, it regulates the <b>contraction</b> <b>of</b> muscles, nerve conduction, and the clotting of blood. As a result, intra- and extracellular calcium levels are tightly regulated by the body. Calcium can play this role because the Ca2+ ion forms stable coordination complexes with many organic compounds, especially proteins; it also forms compounds with a wide range of solubilities, enabling the formation of skeletons.|$|E
