40|$|Background. Reinfusion of shed blood after {{coronary}} artery bypass grafting might increase the levels <b>of</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>enzymes</b> with consequent difficulties in the diagnosis of perioperative myocardial infarction. Methods. Thirty consecutive patients undergoing {{coronary artery}} bypass grafting who bled at least 400 mL within the first 4 hours after operation underwent reinfusion of shed blood. Thirty consecutive patients who were not autotransfused served as control. All patients underwent enzyme determination (total creatine kinase, MB fraction, lactate dehydrogenase, and troponin I) in the shed blood and in circulating blood preoperatively, at arrival {{in the intensive care}} unit, and 6, 24, and 48 hours after operation. Results. The shed blood contained significantly higher concentration <b>of</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>enzymes</b> than the circulating blood at all time intervals (p = 0. 0001).

50|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI) {{refers to}} tissue death (infarction) {{of the heart}} muscle (myocardium). It {{is a type of}} acute coronary syndrome, which describes a sudden or short-term change in symptoms related to blood flow to the heart.

40|$|In valve {{replacement}} surgery, human superoxide dismutase (h-SOD) was administered just before reperfusion, {{and the effect}} of h-SOD on reperfusion injury was studied.

The release of the enzymes during 60 minutes after reperfusion in the group receiving h-SOD (3 mg/kg) was less than that of the control (without h-SOD) group (p< 0. 01).

40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} if <b>cardiac</b> <b>enzymes</b> measured at necropsy {{could be used}} to predict early myocardial infarction. METHODS: <b>Cardiac</b> <b>enzyme</b> activities were measured in body fluids at necropsy. Coroners' necropsies were grouped by gross and microscopic findings into cases of definite myocardial infarction, cases with occlusive coronary artery atheroma but no identifiable myocardial infarction, and non-cardiac cases. Pericardial fluid, peripheral venous blood, and blood from the right atrium were collected. Total creatine phosphokinase, creatine phosphokinase isoenzymes, aspartate aminotransferase and hydroxybutarate dehydrogenase activities were measured and the results analysed by logistic regression. RESULTS: The values of creatine phosphokinase and its isoenzymes were raised in those who had died <b>of</b> <b>cardiac</b> disease and were most discriminatory. Cases of early myocardial infarction without evidence of infarction on routine histological examination could be identified from enzyme activities.

Among other adverse health effects, khat chewing {{has been associated}} with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in heavy consumers. This study was carried out to examine the direct effects of Catha edulis extract on contractility of spontaneously contracting, isolated rabbit heart and to investigate its mechanism of action. Isolated six rabbit’s hearts attached to a Langendorff apparatus were perfused with extract at a constant flow rate and continuously bubbled with a 95 % O 2 / 5 % CO 2 gas mixture. Each heart served as its own control, as responses were recorded before and after administration of C. edulis extract. Varying concentrations of extract (50, 100 and 250 mg/ml) were loaded in the perfusate, their effects recorded and effluent fluid collected for assay <b>of</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>enzymes.</b> Histological examination <b>of</b> the <b>cardiac</b> tissue was performed at the end of perfusion with 250 mg/ml extract.

Histological examination of hearts perfused with 250 mg/ml C. edulis extract revealed the presence of histological changes unique to myocardial infarction, a finding consistent with observed increased levels <b>of</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>enzymes</b> in perfusates.
