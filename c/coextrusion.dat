50|$|<b>Co{{extrusion}}</b> is the extrusion {{of multiple}} layers of material simultaneously. This type of extrusion utilizes two or more extruders to melt and deliver a steady volumetric throughput of different viscous plastics to a single extrusion head (die) which will extrude the materials in the desired form.

40|$|International audienceThe role of {{interphase}} triggered from {{interdiffusion process}} at neighboring layers on controlling the interfacial flow instability of multilayer <b>coextrusion</b> have been highlighted {{in this study}} using a compatible bilayer system. The polymers used are based on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). The interdiffusion kinetics and the rheological and geometrical properties of the generated interphase have been modelized in real experimental conditions of the <b>coextrusion</b> process. Polymer chain orientation in <b>coextrusion</b> process was demonstrated to decelerate the interdiffusion coefficient. Furthermore, the interfacial shear stress was able to promote mixing and homogenizing process at {{the vicinity of the}} interface, which favors the development of the interphase. The convective mixing was evidenced by performing a pre-shear mode on PMMA/PVDF multilayer structures. The rheological and morphological properties of the interphase are related to a lot of parameters like contact time, processing temperature, interfacial shear stress and compatibility of the polymers, etc. Some key classical decisive parameters concerning the interfacial instability phenomena such as viscosity ratio, thickness ratio and elasticity ratio, etc. were highlighted during the <b>coextrusion</b> process. These key factors which are significant for the interfacial stability of <b>coextrusion</b> of incompatible multilayered polymers seem not that important for the studied compatible systems. The <b>coextrusion</b> of PMMA/PVDF compatible bilayers appears to be more stable. This would be attributable to the presence of the interphase generated from interdiffusion and favored from convective mixing. The interfacial flow instability of <b>coextrusion</b> can be reduced (or even eliminated) despite of the very high viscosity ratio and elasticity ratio of PMMA versus PVDF, especially at low temperatures. Overall, apart from the classical mechanical parameters, we have demonstrated that the creation of diffuse interphase that favors the homogenization should be taken into consideration as an important factor to remove the interfacial instability properties...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As final {{component}} of <b>coextrusion</b> system in polymer industry to produce product with multi-layer different materials, the coextrusion-die {{can be regarded}} as the most important determinant that can influence product quality directly.

40|$|Interfacial instabilities {{occurring}} in the <b>coextrusion</b> process of molten polymers have been widely studied. The theoretical work based on the stability of 2 D Poiseuille multilayer flows (invariant along the flow motion) have pointed out the convective nature of this instability (it is either amplified or damped in the flow direction). This behaviour has been confirmed by experimental observations. As this instability is purely elastic (the Reynold number in <b>coextrusion</b> process is very small), {{it is necessary to}} introduce a viscoelastic constitutive equation forthepolymers.

40|$|Polymer melts {{experience}} complex, time variant, {{stress and}} deformation fields on their passage through fixed geometries in many conversion operations. Flow complexity is further increased in operations involving the co-joining {{of two or}} more melt streams where one confining boundary is moving and viscoelastic. Such a complex situation arises in <b>coextrusion</b> processes. This work covers experimental studies on polyethylene melt flows in complex <b>coextrusion</b> geometries with a view to understanding the stress fields involved and their effects on flow stability. A 30 ° 1 <b>coextrusion</b> geometry is studied using two extrusion arrangements. In one arrangement a single extruder is used to feed a 'bifurcated' die design wherein the melt stream is split prior to, and rejoined after, a divider plate in the die. In the other design melt streams are delivered to, and converged at 30 °, using two independent extruders. In a second die melt streams are brought together at 90 °. In each die arrangement melt flow in the confluent region and die land to the die exit was observed through side windows of a visualisation cell. Velocity ratios of the two melt streams were varied and layer thickness ratios producing instability are determined for each melt for a variety of flow conditions. Stress and velocity fields in the <b>coextrusion</b> arrangements were quantified using stress birefringence and particle image velocimetry techniques. The study demonstrates conclusively that wave type interfacial instability occurred in the <b>coextrusion</b> geometries when the same low density polyethylene melt is used in each stream. This observation occurred at specific, repeatable, stream layer ratios in each die arrangement. The complex flows were numerical modelled using a modified Leonov model and Flow 2000 P software. There was reasonable agreement between modelled at experimentally determined stress fields. Modelling however provided far more detailed stress gradient information than could be resolved from the optical techniques. A total normal stress difference (TNSD) sign criterion was used to predict the critical layer ratio for the onset of the interfacial instability in one die arrangement and good agreement between theory and experiment has been obtained. The study conclusively demonstrates wave type interfacial instability in the <b>coextrusion</b> process is not caused by process perturbations potentially introduced by extruder screw rotation but is associated with process-history dependant differences in melt elasticity. © 2009 American Institute of Physics...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTSeveral {{polymers}} can {{be combined}} in one multilayer structure by reactive <b>coextrusion.</b> Tie-layers are often used to compatibilize adjacent layers and may reduce or suppress interfacialinstabilities and defects in multilayer <b>coextrusion</b> flow. However, a new additional defect defined as“grainy” defect can be observed. In our best of knowledge, no study in literature has been dedicatedto understand its origin.

The aim of this work is to understand therelationship between the instabilities and defects encountered in multilayer coextruded films and therole of the copolymer formed in-situ between tie and barrier layers. Polyamide 6 (PA 6) andethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) were used as barrier layers sandwiched in polypropylene(PP) with or without tie-layer based on polypropylene grafted maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA). Influence of process parameters and nature of the polymer pair on the generation of “grainy” defecthas been assessed and related to the rheological and the physico-chemical properties of layers. These experiments showed that this defect appeared mainly in the compatibilized EVOH systemand could be distinguished from the usual <b>coextrusion</b> instabilities. Interfacial properties between tieand barrier layers have been investigated. Shear stress relaxation experiments have been carried outon reactive tie/barrier bilayers. Due to the interphase generated in-situ, the relaxation behavior wasaltered by extending the relaxation time.
