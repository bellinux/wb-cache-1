50|$|Elsinoë mangiferae, <b>common</b> name Mango <b>Scab,</b> is {{also known}} Denticularia mangiferae or Sphaceloma mangiferae (anamorph). It is an ascomycete plant {{pathogen}} native to tropical regions and specific for survival on only one host, the mango. Originally described in 1943 from Florida and Cuba specimens, this pathogen has since spread worldwide and is becoming a pathogen of great concern for the mango industries in Australia and India. E. mangiferae is an obligate parasite of mango, and therefore cannot be grown outside of living plant tissue. The species was first described formally in 1946.|$|R

40|$|<b>Common</b> potato <b>scab</b> affects potato farmers {{worldwide}} and costs the Tasmanian potato farming industry approximately 5 {{million dollars a}} year. The disease is caused in white potatoes by the common soil bacterium streptomyces scabies, from which several secondary metabolites have been isolated; these are known as the thaxtomin class of phytotoxins. These compounds {{have been shown to}} cause scabs in potatoes in sterile conditions and are phytotoxic to cellulose based plants. Several approaches to the total synthesis of the thaxtomins have been investigated. The most successful proceeds via the synthesis of 4 -nitrotryptophan, followed by peptide coupling and cyclisation to give two of the three dehydroxy-thaxtomins. Other routes starting from glycine anhydride using condensation chemistry to build the three ring system have provided a series of analogues for structure activity testing. Toxicity of the analogues and synthetic thaxtomins has been analysed using Arabidopsis thaliana. Two analogues showed activity approaching thaxtomin A and show promise as potential new herbicides. Non-toxic analogues have been tested for their ability to ameliorate or negate the effects of thaxtomin A using a variety of models. These compounds provide a possible solution to the scab problem. Current methods for the synthesis of the pyrrolidine antibiotic anisomycin are complicated and rely on the preparation of a 3 -pyrroline intermediate. Two novel methods to target this advanced intermediate are discussed, firstly use of a Zn/HCI reduction of a a-ketopyrrole, and secondly the reduction of N-tosyl pyrroles with TFA/NaCNBH 3. The use of N-toysl protected 3 -pyrrolines as building blocks towards hydroxyl substituted pyrrolidines is also explored. Synthesis of gram quantities of the C 19 and C 21 triene sex pheromones of the autumn gum moth (Mnesampe/a private) has proved difficult because of the tendency of the trienes to decompose through auto oxidation. We present an approach to the synthesis of these compounds by spiking the starting material with the antioxidant BHT and carrying it through the reaction scheme. This enables a significant improvement in the overall yield of the desired product, which increased from 20...|$|R
40|$|For {{a number}} of years the writer has made some {{observations}} on a disease of the plum and cherry which has received the <b>common</b> name of <b>Scab.</b> (Cladosporium carpophilum Von Thuemen). My attention was first attracted to this disease in the fall of 1889 when many varieties of Prunus americana suffered severely. It has been noted on this species every year since, with the exception of 1892 when the plum crop on the college grounds was a failure. In 1891 and 1892 it occured on such varieties of Prunus cerasus as Cerise d’Ostheim, Spate Amarelle, Shadow Amarelle and Wagner. The assistant Mr. F. O. Stewart was detailed in 1892 to make observations, on different varieties {{and as a result of}} his work he reports that Schatten Amarelle, Shadow Amarelle, Spate Amarelle and Lutovka are affected. This list as is known consists chiefly of Russian varieties. As the orchards on the college consist entirely of this class of fruit it is hard to conjecture what other varieties would have done when grown in similar situations. I may state, however, that the Early Richmond growing not far from the college grounds has escaped this trouble entirely. Late and Early Richmond grown in the village of Ames as well as some Russian varieties were also exempt...|$|R
30|$|Apple {{proliferation}} symptoms {{have also}} been frequently observed {{in the last decade}} in apple orchards in Asturias, in the North coast of Spain. This region has long tradition in cider-making, and most of the 10, 000  ha of apple orchards are cultivated almost exclusively to produce cider-apples. The majority of the surface devoted to apple production is occupied by traditional extensive orchards with big trees grown on seedling rootstocks. Since the early 1990 s, an increasing percentage of these old orchards have been substituted by new semi-intensive ones with trees growing on semi-dwarfing rootstocks (Dapena et al. 2005). Those orchards are planted with selected local cultivars tolerant to several <b>common</b> apple diseases (<b>scab,</b> canker, powdery mildew). The use of pesticide in both situations is very low, even null. Sprays are mainly made with narrow-spectrum insecticides against the codling moth (Cydia pomonella L.) or the rosy apple aphid (Dysaphis plantaginea Passerini). Such situation of low pressure of pesticide use potentially allows high abundance and diversity of insects in orchards (Miñarro et al. 2005, 2009). The immersion of those orchards in an agricultural landscape characterized by a mosaic of small and different-land-use plots separated by hedgerows, as well as the occurrence of a permanent rich floral groundcover, also favour insect abundance and richness (Miñarro and Prida 2013; Rosa García and Miñarro 2014).|$|R

40|$|The genomic {{relatedness}} {{was evaluated}} by DNA-DNA hybridization for 23 strains (21 were pathogenic {{and two were}} saprophytic strains) isolated from lesions of <b>common</b> and netted <b>scab</b> in France and 19 strains from other countries, including type strains of Streptomyces species. Three genomospecies were defined within the conventional species of Streptomyces scabies, and these genomospecies were different from other pathogenic described species (Streptomyces acidiscabies, Streptomyces caviscabies) based on previously published phenotypic data. Two of these genomospecies (1 and 3) correspond to new species, for which the names Streptomyces europaeiscabiei sp. nov. (with type strain CFBP 4497 (T)) and Streptomyces stelliscabiei sp. nov. (with type strain CFBP 4521 (T)) are proposed. Genomospecies 2 corresponds to S. scabies (with type strain CFBP 4517 (T) = ATCC 49173 (T)), and includes only one French strain. The pathogenic strains associated with netted scab lesions constituted a new species that was named Streptomyces reticuliscabiei sp. nov. (with type strain CFBP 4531 (T)). The G+C content of DNA from the three strains CFBP 4497 (T) (S. europaeiscabiei), CFBP 4521 (T) (S. stelliscabiei), CFBP 4531 (T) (S. reticuliscabiei) was 71. 3, 71. 0 and 69. 8 mol%, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16 S rRNA gene sequences showed that the type strain CFBP 4497 (T) was {{very similar to the}} type strain of S. scabies, whereas, the type strain of S. stelliscabiei, CFBP 4521 (T), was very similar to the type strain of Streptomyces bottropensis.

50|$|The {{first known}} {{reference}} to <b>common</b> <b>scab</b> {{dates back to}} 1825 when it was included in John Claudius Loudon Encyclopaedia of Agriculture. It was not known what caused it then, it was not thought to have a biological cause, but was noted {{to be associated with}} soils treated with alkaline materials. In 1884, Worthington George Smith suggested that it was caused by grit in soil irritating potato tubers as they grew. The theory gained much support, as it was known to be more common on light gritty soils. In 1890 however, Roland Thaxter isolated a microbe that could cause <b>common</b> <b>scab</b> lesions, naming it Oospora scabies. Over the years, this species was renamed several times, now being known as Streptomyces scabies.
