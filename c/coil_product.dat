40|$|MBA, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004 The steel {{industry}} is characterised by heavy fluctuations in product demand and fierce competition from players across the globe. It {{is for this}} reason, important for Highveld Steel {{to ensure that their}} strategic decisions are both effective {{and that there is a}} good fit between market conditions and strategies. In this report, the product diversity strategy of Highveld Steel regarding <b>coiled</b> <b>products</b> is evaluated against its efficiency in generating positive contribution margins towards company profitability. This was done by developing a model to quantify the real contribution margin of all <b>coil</b> <b>products</b> produced. In this model, processing time, product downgrading costs and the cost of production downtime due to production delays were quantified and a formula was derived to calculate the cumulative effect of all these variables on product cost. This formula was applied to historical yield information available for the past four years of production. From this, the real contribution of different product categories were calculated and used to identify products with negative or small contribution margins on the one side, as well as products with large contribution margins on the other. It was found that 15 % of all products produced by strip mill at present, have a negative contribution margin and should for that reason, not be produced. The information gathered from the application of the model was used to furnish recommendations on how Highveld's marketing and production departments should go about improving the contribution of <b>coiled</b> <b>products</b> to company profitability. It was proven empirically that Highveld could, in applying the recommendations furnished in this report, generate extra annual contribution on <b>coil</b> <b>products</b> of between 14 and 37 %. The strategy developed was recommended as an interim strategy and it was further recommended that the model developed should be continuously applied and used on a monthly basis to evaluate order acceptance strategies to ensure a good fit between these strategies and prevailing market conditions.

The MAPS investigators and sponsor should be congratu-lated on their willingness to test the efficacy ofMatrix. TheMAPS trial in no way negates the premise that the modification of coil surfaces or composition could potentially enhance coil perfor-mance and/or the long-term durability of coil embolization.

40|$|In {{order to}} find {{correlations}} between skin gland morphology and specific ethological features, the cutaneous glands of the foot pads of Procavia capensis were studied by histological and various histochemical methods and by electron microscopy. In the foot pads, abundant specific eccrine skin glands occur, which consist of coiled tubular secretory portions and coiled ducts. The wall of the secretory part is composed of cuboidal glandular cells and myoepithelial cells. Among the glandular cells two types occur: clear and dark cells. Clear cells have numerous mitochondria and form a basal labyrinth, indicating fluid transport. Dark cells, which stain strongly with periodic acid-Schiff, contain a highly developed perinuclear Golgi apparatus, large amounts of rough endoplasmic reticulum and many secretory granules indicating production of glycoproteins. Cytokeratin (CK) 19 was found in secretory compartments and ducts, CK 14 only in duct cells. Single cells of the secretory coils and ducts may be stained with antibodies against antimicrobial peptides. Some glandular cells contain proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive nuclei especially in the ducts indicating an increased cell proliferation. Terminal transferase (TdT) -mediated d-UTP nick-end labeling-positive nuclei can be detected predominantly in the secretory coils and rarely in the transitional portions between ducts and end pieces.

The scope is limited to mid-range coils – <b>coils</b> where the <b>product</b> (fd) of the frequency f and the coil diameter d is in the range of 2 - 30 MHz-m. Common applications include mouse brain and body coils from 125 MHz to 750 MHz, rat body coils up to 500 MHz, and small surface coils at all fields. In this regime, all the sources of loss (coil, capacitor, sample, shield, and transmission lines) are important.

Additional 29 aneurysms were treated with standard (n= 22) or with degradable polymer-covered (n= 7) platinum coils.  After 4 to 52 weeks, the retrieved aneurysms were methylmethacrylate embedded, and ground sections were surface-stained with Rapid Bone Stain and Giemsa solution. Cartilage and/or bone tissue was assessed by light microscopy; respective tissue areas in the aneurysms were determined by computerized histomorphometry. Cartilage neoformation was observed from 26 to 52 weeks. Single chondrocytes to hyaline or fibrous cartilage areas, occupying up to 29 % of the aneurysm cavity, were found in 6 aneurysms, treated with HydroCoil (n= 4), Hydrogel-only (n= 1), and resorbable polymer (n= 1) devices. Chondral ossification associated cartilage neoformation in 2 of these 4 HydroCoil-treated aneurysms.

40|$|Pyrethroid {{resistance}} is envisioned to {{be a major}} problem for the vector control program since, at present, there are no suitable chemical substitutes for pyrethroids. Cross-resistance to knockdown agents, which are mainly used in mosquito <b>coils</b> and related <b>products</b> as spatial repellents, is the most serious concern. Since cross-{{resistance is}} a global phenomenon, we have started to monitor the distribution of mosquito resistance to pyrethroids. The first pilot study was carried out in Vietnam. We periodically drove along the national road from the north end to the Mekong Delta in Vietnam and collected mosquito larvae from used tires. Simplified susceptibility tests were performed using the fourth instar larvae of Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, and Culex quinquefasciatus. Compared with the other species, Ae. aegypti demonstrated the most prominent reduction in susceptibility. For Ae. aegypti, significant increases in the susceptibility indices with a decrease in the latitude of collection points were observed, indicating that the susceptibility of Ae. aegypti against d-allethrin was lower in the southern part, including mountainous areas, as compared to that {{in the northern part of}} Vietnam. There was a significant correlation between the susceptibility indices in Ae. aegypti and the sum of annual pyrethroid use for malaria control (1998 – 2002). This might explain that the use of pyrethroids as residual treatment inside houses and pyrethroid-impregnated bed nets for malaria control is attributable to low pyrethroid susceptibility in Ae. aegypti. Such insecticide treatment appeared to have been intensively administered in the interior and along the periphery of human habitatio...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this dissertation was to investigate how cold rolling process parameters could be optimised to improve surface quality of the AA 3003 H 22 treadbright <b>coils.</b> This treadbright <b>product</b> is one of Hulett Aluminium’s main products and is exported mainly to the North American market. One of its critical requirements is a defect-free bright surface. The literature review was conducted with particular focus {{on the effects of}} selected parameters or settings with respect to surface quality and a chapter outlining these aspects has been included. It was clear from the literature review that selected parameters do affect the surface quality and if adjusted accordingly can improve surface quality on treadbright coils. Subsequent chapters after the literature review outline how the tests were conducted, procedures followed and equipments used from the cold rolling machine to laboratories. Surface appearance results after each parameter was adjusted, showed that the surface quality did improve and even got better when other parameters like the colouring roll angle and percentage reduction were adjusted. Correct working limits within which each parameter would yield acceptable surface quality were also established. All experiments conducted had no influence on the microstructure of the metal as it remained the same throughout each experiment. The same has been found with the mechanical properties as percentage reductions experiments led to no change in tensile strength, proof strength and percentage elongation. In conclusion, this research has proved that cold rolling process parameters selected did affect the product surface quality. If controlled they can be used to optimise the surface quality on the treadbright product as required by Hulett Aluminium and its customers...|$|R
40|$|Summary: A new, coated {{bioactive}} coil {{has been}} developed to improve the long-term results of endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. The purpose of this preliminary study {{was to assess the}} feasibility and safety of selective embolization of intracranial aneurysms with Matrix coils in 20 consecutive patients. Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms by endosaccular coil placement has become an accepted alternative to surgical clip placement (1); however, the main disadvantage of this technique compared with surgery is aneurysm recurrence (2), especially for large aneurysmal sacs or wide-necked aneurysms. To circumvent this potential limitation, many investiga-tions are currently evaluating new coils, including biologically active coils (3), radioactive coils (4), and coated coils with a swelling hydrogel (5). The aim of these innovations is to promote intra-aneurysmal clot organization and fibrosis (3, 4) or to increase packing density (5), which is associated with a higher long-term occlusion rate (6). The complete Matrix coils (Target Therapeutics, Fremont, CA) product line has recently become available, but no study has yet eval-uated the feasibility of endovascular treatment with these coils. We report our experience of selective embolization with Matrix coils in 20 consecutive pa-tients with an intracranial aneurysm. Technique Matrix detachable coils are platinum coils covered with a bioabsorbable polymer (90 % polyglycolide, 10 % polyactide) and attached to a stainless steel delivery wire. The coil consists of 70 % polymer and 30 % platinum. The details of coil charac-teristics were described elsewhere (7), and the detachment system is the same as that used with Guglielmi detachable <b>coils</b> (GDCs).

40|$|Micro- or {{nanometer}} sized magnetic particles (beads) {{currently have}} a vast range of life science applications in, for example, bioseparation techniques, cancer therapy, development of contrast agents and biosensing techniques. In the latter field, magnetic beads offer several unique advantages, including minimal background signals, {{physical and chemical}} stability and low manufacturing costs. Because of these properties, magnetic biosensing techniques are potential candidates for low-cost, easy-to-use molecular diagnostic devices. This doctoral thesis focuses mainly on the proof of principle and further {{development of a new}} magnetic biosensor platform for detection of DNA targets, a potential candidate {{for a new generation of}} low-cost, easy-to-use diagnostic devices: the Volume-Amplified Magnetic Nanobead Detection Assay (VAM-NDA). The VAM-NDA principle combines target recognition by padlock probe ligation followed by rolling circle amplification (RCA) of the reacted probes with changes in Brownian relaxation behaviour of magnetic nanobeads (typically ~ 100 nm in diameter) induced by a change in hydrodynamic bead volume. More specifically, the RCA <b>products</b> (<b>coils,</b> typically ~ 1 μm in diameter) are detected magnetically by adding magnetic beads tagged with detection probes complementary to part of the repeating RCA-coil sequence. Thus, depending on the target concentration, a certain quantity of beads binds to the coils by base-pair hybridisation (bead immobilisation), resulting in a dramatic bead volume increase, which is then detected by measuring the complex magnetisation spectrum. Use of a commercial SQUID magnetometer for measuring complex magnetisation resulted in a detection limit in the low pM range for DNA targets with excellent quantification accuracy. Simultaneous multiplexing was also evaluated. The stability and aging of typical commercial ferrofluids (suspensions of magnetic beads) were investigated by measuring the complex magnetisation of and interbead interactions in oligonucleotide-functionalised ferrofluids. In summary, the bead surface characteristics were found to have a strong impact on the measured dynamic magnetic properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{family of}} human {{proteins}} containing a potassium channel tetramerization domain (KCTD) includes 21 members whose function is largely unknown. Recent reports have however suggested that these proteins are implicated in very important biological processes. KCTD 11 /REN, the best-characterized {{member of the}} family to date, plays {{a crucial role in the}} ubiquitination of HDAC 1 by acting, in complex with Cullin 3, as an E 3 ubiquitin ligase. By combining bioinformatics and mutagenesis analyses, here we show that the protein is expressed in two alternative variants: a short previously characterized form (sKCTD 11) composed by 232 amino acids and a longer variant (IKCTD 11) which contains an N-terminal extension of 39 residues. Interestingly, we demonstrate that IKCTD 11 starts with a non-canonical AUU codon. Although both sKCTD 11 and IKCTD 11 bear a POZ/BTB domain in their N-terminal region, this domain is complete only in the long form. Indeed, sKCTD 11 presents an incomplete POZ/BTB domain. Nonetheless, sKCTD 11 is still able to bind Cul 3, although to much lesser extent than IKCTD 11, and to perform its biological activity. The heterologous expression of sKCTD 11 and IKCTD 11 and their individual domains in Escherichia <b>coil</b> yielded soluble <b>products</b> as fusion proteins only for the longer form. In contrast to the closely related KCTD 5 which is pentameric, the characterization of both IKCTD 11 and its POZ/BTB domain by gel filtration and light scattering indicates that the protein likely forms stable tetramers. In line with this result, experiments conducted in cells show that the active protein is not monomeric. Based on these findings, homology-based models were built for IKCTD 11 BIB and for its complex with Cul 3. These analyses indicate that a stable IKCTD 11 BTB-Cul 3 three-dimensional model with a 4 : 4 stoichiometry can be generated. Moreover, these models provide insights into the determinants of the tetramer stability and into the regions involved in IKCTD 11 -Cul 3 recognition. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

40|$|Traditional <b>coil</b> {{coated steel}} <b>product</b> {{consists}} of two layers of coating, which are applied {{on top of a}} pretreated hot-dip-galvanized steel coil. In other fields of industry the TOC coating method is quite widely used and it has attracted attentions also in the coil coating industry. The economically and environmentally sound alternative designed to replace the traditional pretreatment and the base coating layer has increased research and development of the TOC method. 	Thin organic coatings in coil coating applications have been studied quite scarcely in SSAB. This thesis {{is a part of the}} HYBRIDS – Hybrid Materials program, which studies among other subjects the potential of the TOC-method. In this thesis the goal was to optimize a coating layer on top of two separate TOC-substrates. The objective of the thesis was to find the most suitable binder, film thickness and curing cycle combination for the first coating layer of the TOC based product. The chemistry of the studied binders was mainly based on polyester and PVdF chemistry. With isocyanate crosslinked binder system, a polyurethane-chemistry based binder was also introduced to the studies. With all of the previously mentioned binder systems, the film thicknesses and curing cycles were varied to test a wide variety of property combinations. 	The optimization started with the results of the accelerated environment exposure testing, with which the first elimination of binders was based. The mechanical testing data was analyzed with statistical method ANOVA. With the statistical analyzing method the most potential binder, film thickness and curing cycle for each TOC was selected from both of the binder categories. The final products were compared to reference samples, which were treated with the same paint process. The samples used for the references were traditionally pretreated and untreated HDG-steels. The final conclusions on the optimized products were done based on accelerated environment exposure testing and mechanical testing. 	With the optimization process a clear indication was observed, that the film thickness variations and binder selection affects the properties of the product significantly. The thickest dry films performed with best results. A significant difference was not observed with the curing cycles, but marginally better results were observed with double curing with the TOC 2 substrate. 70 % PVdF / 30 % PMMA ratio binders performed with best results with both of the TOC substrates. TOC 2 had significant difficulties with polyester-chemistry, which led to a series of separate studies. Isocyanate (instead of melamine) crosslinked binder worked perfectly with the said substrate. 	Accelerated humidity exposure testing results and mechanical resistance testing results reveal a significant importance of the pretreatment or TOC-layer. HDG steel with any sort of binder suffers a significant amount of damage and deterioration during exposure to humidity in elevated temperatures. Mechanical resistance results show a similar trend. The traditionally pretreated samples and TOC based samples, when compared against each other, showed notable but not significant differences on behalf of the TOC based samples. A conclusion from the testing in this thesis is that the TOC based product can perform at least as well as the traditionally pretreated product. Although the results are quite encouraging and positive for the TOC based products, the results are not unequivocal and can only be considered as a guideline towards future studies and research projects...|$|R
