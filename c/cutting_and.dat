40|$|Abstract. The Cutting force <b>and</b> <b>cutting</b> {{temperature}} are {{the important}} factors which {{can affect the}} quality and accuracy of the aluminum alloy work-pieces. Based on the theoretical analysis of the <b>cutting</b> force <b>and</b> <b>cutting</b> temperature, the three-dimensional Finite Element Model (FEM) with the overall tool is established. The corresponding results of the digital simulation were researched, <b>and</b> the <b>cutting</b> force <b>and</b> <b>cutting</b> temperature were analyzed. The <b>cutting</b> temperature <b>and</b> <b>cutting</b> force changes were compared by altering the axial depth of cut and the feed rate...|$|R

5|$|Diamonds {{have been}} treasured as gemstones since their use as {{religious}} icons in ancient India. Their usage in engraving tools also dates to early human history.

5|$|In the arts, {{silicon carbide}} {{is a popular}} {{abrasive}} in modern lapidary due to the durability and low cost of the material. In manufacturing, it is used for its hardness in abrasive machining processes such as grinding, honing, water-jet <b>cutting</b> <b>and</b> sandblasting. Particles of silicon carbide are laminated to paper to create sandpapers and the grip tape on skateboards.|$|E

5|$|A concave line of {{abrasion}} {{and polishing}} {{can be found}} on both one of the central kerb-stones on the western end of the monument and a kerb-stone on the south-east of the monument. These have been attributed to the sharpening of flint and other stone axe-blades on these sarsens. It is possible that these tools were sharpened for use in <b>cutting</b> <b>and</b> carving the timber levers and struts which would have been used in erecting the stones and constructing the tomb. Similar evidence for the sharpening of tools has been found at West Kennet Long Barrow, as well as later prehistoric monuments such as Stonehenge.|$|E

5|$|Disturbance {{has been}} implicated in the {{formation}} of vegetation dominated by large Attalea species. In seasonally dry Amazonian forests the density of large adult A.maripa palms was correlated with canopy openness; the species also dominates savannas formed by repeated forest fires in Trinidad and Tobago. Attalea speciosa forms pure stands in many parts of Brazil where natural forest vegetation has been cleared. Similarly, stands of A.funifera in Bahia, Brazil (which are cultivated for piassava fibre) are managed using fire—the seedlings survive <b>cutting</b> <b>and</b> burning, and are able to dominate burned forest patches.|$|E
5|$|Female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM), {{also known as}} female genital <b>cutting</b> <b>and</b> female circumcision, is the ritual cutting or removal of {{some or all of}} the external female genitalia.

5|$|Outside of breed-specific shows, the Saddlebred is also {{promoted}} as suitable for competitive trail riding, endurance riding, dressage, combined driving, eventing, and show jumping. Some Saddlebreds are also suitable for fox hunting, <b>cutting</b> <b>and</b> roping. Because {{they are so}} closely affiliated with their traditional show ring competition, they are sometimes mistaken for warmbloods or Thoroughbred crosses when participating in other equine events. They are also suitable family horses used for trail and pleasure riding and ranch work.|$|E
5|$|The Morgan breed {{is known}} for its versatility, and is used for a number of English and Western events.

Morgans were the first American breed to compete in the World Pairs Driving competition, representing the US. They can be seen as mounts for 4-H and Pony Club participants and therapeutic riding programs, due to their gentle disposition and steady movement.|$|E

5|$|The castle was {{primarily}} built from bricks, with stone {{used for the}} detailing, such as doorways. The brickwork was decorated with patterns of darker bricks, called diapering, which was used to show symbols associated with Lord Hastings, as well as objects such as a jug and a ship. This style of decorative brickwork and stonework was popular across England at this time, but particularly so at Eton College, where John Cowper, the master mason on the project, had been an apprentice. Although the castle was not extensively decorated, the brickwork at Kirby Muxloe was skillfully executed, with the bricklayers <b>cutting</b> <b>and</b> shaping the kiln-fired bricks to produce spiral and domed vaulting.|$|E
