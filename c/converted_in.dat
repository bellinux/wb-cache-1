5|$|Although every {{university}} in Australia accepts the IB diploma, entry criteria differ from university to university. Some universities accept students on their IB point count, whereas others require the points to be <b>converted.</b> <b>In</b> most states, this {{is based on}} the Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR). In Queensland, IBDP scores are converted to a QTAC scale to determine selection rank.|$|E
5|$|Although the XCG-17 {{failed to}} lead to any {{production}} of a C-47 derived glider type, a single C-47 was <b>converted</b> <b>in</b> the field to glider configuration by the Fifth Air Service Area Command, located at Nichols Field on Luzon in the Philippines, during January 1946. Carried out {{in much the same}} manner as the XCG-17, the conversion included octagonally shaped fairings over the engine mountings, with an auxiliary power unit from a B-24 Liberator bomber being installed.|$|E
5|$|Early Dutch missionaries faced strong {{opposition}} among Torajans, {{especially among the}} elite, because the abolition of their profitable slave trade had angered them. Some Torajans were forcibly relocated to the lowlands by the Dutch, {{where they could be}} more easily controlled. Taxes were kept high, undermining the wealth of the elites. Ultimately, the Dutch influence did not subdue Torajan culture, and only a few Torajans were <b>converted.</b> <b>In</b> 1950, only 10% of the population had converted to Christianity.|$|E

5|$|Parseghian's {{candidacy}} {{for the head}} coaching job at Notre Dame was unusual {{because he was not}} a Notre Dame graduate, as every head coach since Knute Rockne had been. Parseghian was also an Armenian Presbyterian, making him the first non-Catholic coach since Rockne, who <b>converted</b> <b>in</b> 1925. Joyce made it clear before his hiring that he did not care about Parseghian's religion, but simply wanted someone who could lead the football team to success.|$|E
5|$|The Douglas XCG-17 was an American assault glider, {{developed}} by the conversion of a C-47 Skytrain twin-engine transport during World War II. Although the XCG-17 was successful in testing, the requirement for such a large glider had passed, and no further examples of the type were built; one additional C-47, however, was <b>converted</b> <b>in</b> the field to glider configuration briefly during 1946 for evaluation, but was quickly reconverted to powered configuration.|$|E
5|$|The Vicars Choral {{currently}} number twelve men, of whom {{three are}} choral scholars.

5|$|The first ballast {{motor cars}} were former trailer cars {{built for the}} Central London Railway in 1900, which were {{converted}} to motor cars for trials of the first multiple system {{to be used in}} Britain, and were retained for departmental use after 1903. These were followed by French and Hungarian Gate stock cars, built in 1906, which were <b>converted</b> <b>in</b> the 1920s and 1930s. The next batch consisted on 14 standard stock cars <b>converted</b> <b>in</b> 1953. Rolling stock reorganisation and replacement in the 1970s on the District and Metropolitan lines resulted in a number of surface stock cars being used for pilot motor duties. Subsequently motor cars of 1938 stock and 1960 stock were used for this purpose, and complete 4-car units of 1962 stock.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{had only}} {{recently}} arrived {{in some of these}} kingdoms. Some had been converted by the Gregorian mission, a group of Roman missionaries who arrived in Kent in 597 and who mainly influenced southern Britain. Others had been converted by the Hiberno-Scottish mission, chiefly Irish missionaries working in Northumbria and neighbouring kingdoms. A few kingdoms, such as Dál Riata, became Christian but how they did so is unknown. The native Picts, according to the medieval writer Bede, were <b>converted</b> <b>in</b> two stages, initially by native Britons under Ninian, and subsequently by Irish missionaries.|$|E
5|$|First {{designated}} by 1919, M-76 initially terminated at Roscommon. It was later extended north through Grayling and west to Kalkaska in the 1920s. A second, disconnected, segment {{was added to}} the highway in the 1930s. By the early 1940s, both the disconnected section and the Kalkaska–Grayling were added to M-72. M-76 was <b>converted</b> <b>in</b> stages into a freeway in the late 1960s and early 1970s. When the last segment was completed, the number was removed from the highway, and the freeway was added to I-75.|$|E

5|$|For the regiment, {{expansion}} {{was on a}} {{more modest}} scale {{than that of the}} Great War. Ten battalions (see List of battalions of the King's Regiment (Liverpool)) were formed between 1939 and 1940, including the reconstituted 8th (Liverpool Irish) Battalion. Two of the battalions converted to armour and anti-air roles in 1941: the 11th became the 152nd Regiment in the Royal Armoured Corps, but continued to wear their King's Regiment cap badge on the black beret of the RAC, as did all infantry units <b>converted</b> <b>in</b> this way, while the 12th transferred to the Royal Artillery as 101st Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment.|$|E
5|$|He {{played in}} {{all three of the}} group games in the 1990 World Cup in Italy, and England topped Group F, Gascoigne {{providing}} the assist for Mark Wright's winner against Egypt. In the first knockout game against Belgium he made another assist after chipping a free-kick into the penalty area, where David Platt volleyed the ball into the net. Gascoigne was at the centre of the action again in the quarter-final clash with Cameroon when he gave away a penalty, which Cameroon <b>converted.</b> <b>In</b> extra-time he made a successful through-ball pass from which Gary Lineker won, and subsequently scored a penalty, which proved to be the winning goal.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Boisselier {{converted}} to Raëlism, a UFO religion {{founded by the}} French journalist Claude Vorilhon, usually known as Raël, in 1973. After attending a meeting at which Raël spoke, she felt strongly that he was completely honest and joined his movement. She had left her husband, alleging violent behavior, shortly before her conversion; afterwards, owing to her involvement with Raëlism, he gained sole custody of their youngest child. Boisselier believed that religious intolerance motivated a court to transfer the child's custody. Although her faith led to tension with her parents, her eldest child <b>converted.</b> <b>In</b> the 1990s, Raëlism was seen as dangerous and viewed with disdain in France, resulting in loss of employment for prominent members. The hostility was fueled in part by public concerns about new religious movements after deaths caused by the Order of the Solar Temple in Europe during the mid-1990s.|$|E

5|$|In 604, another bishopric was founded, {{this time}} at Rochester, where Justus was consecrated as bishop. The king of Essex was <b>converted</b> <b>in</b> the same year, {{allowing}} another see to be established at London, with Mellitus as bishop. Rædwald, {{the king of the}} East Angles, also was converted, but no see was established in his territory. Rædwald had been converted while visiting Æthelberht in Kent, but when he returned to his own court he worshiped pagan gods as well as the Christian god. Bede relates that Rædwald's backsliding was because of his still-pagan wife, but the historian S. D. Church sees political implications of overlordship behind the vacillation about conversion. When Augustine died in 604, Laurence, another missionary, succeeded him as archbishop.|$|E
5|$|In late November 2011, {{the site}} of a former BJ's Wholesale Club in Norcross, Georgia was <b>converted</b> <b>in</b> {{appearance}} to a Costco for shooting. On January 23, 2012, Hill announced that filming had concluded. Multiple scene takes were made, allowing the cast to follow the script as written and inject their own improvisations. Special effects company Legacy Effects provided creature designs and effects for the aliens. The alien costume featured an animatronic head, remotely controlled by three people. The suit was hot even in cold areas, and had to be unzipped to let Doug Jones cool off between takes. The costume was enhanced with CGI in a number of ways, including replacing arms and dilating pupils (which Schaffer thought made the creature seem more alive).|$|E
5|$|It {{had been}} {{decided that the}} Bergen Line, unlike the Voss Line, was to be built with {{standard}} gauge. So the newly laid line from Bergen to Voss had to be <b>converted</b> <b>in</b> time {{for the opening of}} the Bergen Line. This was especially challenging because of the continuous traffic on the line, with 36 departures per day to Nesttun, six to Garnes and four to Voss. In preparation a few curves had to be straightened, the tunnels widened and the bridges strengthened. On the night of 10/11 August 1904 all the track was changed and in the morning the trains could operate on standard gauge to Voss.|$|E
