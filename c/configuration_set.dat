But many users have used one <b>configuration</b> <b>setting</b> across different workloads, leaving untapped the performance potential of systems. A good <b>configuration</b> <b>setting</b> can greatly improve {{the performance of a}} deployed system under certain workloads. But with tens or hundreds of parameters, it becomes a highly costly task to decide which <b>configuration</b> <b>setting</b> leads to the best performance. While such task requires the strong expertise in both the system and the application, users commonly lack such expertise. To help users tap the performance potential of systems, we present BestConfig, a system for automatically finding a best <b>configuration</b> <b>setting</b> within a resource limit for a deployed system under a given application workload. BestConfig is designed with an extensible architecture to automate the configuration tuning for general systems. To tune system configurations within a resource limit, we propose the divide-and-diverge sampling method and the recursive bound-and-search algorithm. BestConfig can improve the throughput of Tomcat by 75 %, that of Cassandra by 63 %, that of MySQL by 430 %, and reduce the running time of Hive join job by about 50 % and that of Spark join job by about 80 %, solely by configuration adjustment...|$|R

Codes defined over higher order of Galois field, have increased computation complexity and thereby it put forth the challenges in efficient hardware realization of the decoder. In this paper, modifications in the Non-binary LDPC decoder to obtain reduced <b>configuration</b> <b>sets,</b> aimed to reduce the decoding complexity is proposed. <b>Configuration</b> <b>sets</b> are the possible combinations of the message sets {{that are involved in}} the parity check equation of LDPC decoder. Min-sum algorithm based decoder is modelled with the specification of IEEE 802. 11 n standard, with the codelength of 648, rate for GF (4) Galois field, over the AWGN channel. The mathematical formulation of the proposed complexity reduction methodology is presented. The decoding performance of reduced <b>configuration</b> <b>sets</b> is analyzed and it is found that the complexity is reduced by an average of 83 %, with negligible degradation in performance in terms of bit error rate...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} considers stimulus-based {{influences on}} consumer decision-making. Context effects, {{referred to as}} <b>set</b> <b>configuration</b> effects in this dissertation, have repeatedly been shown to influence choices consumers make. For example, the choice probability of an alternative increases when a similar, but inferior alternative is added to a set originally containing two alternatives. Studies examining <b>set</b> <b>configuration</b> effects have generally been conducted using simple choice tasks; that is choice sets with few attributes and alternatives. Some authors have argued that {{increasing the number of}} alternatives and attributes, a more complex task, should reduce the probability of <b>set</b> <b>configuration</b> effects. Very few studies have utilized complex tasks to empirically test this assumption. Hence, the extent to which choice <b>set</b> <b>configurations</b> influence choice in complex tasks (i. e. more alternatives and attributes) has not been sufficiently examined. This thesis considers choice <b>set</b> <b>configuration</b> effects among consumers presented with complex choice tasks. Five experiments were created to test the influence of <b>set</b> <b>configurations</b> on choice in more complex choice tasks than typically researched. Across these experiments, two <b>set</b> <b>configurations</b> were examined; uniqueness and asymmetric dominance. Uniqueness denotes a <b>set</b> <b>configuration</b> in which a single alternative is unique on an important attribute among heterogeneous competitor alternatives. Asymmetric dominance is a <b>set</b> <b>configuration</b> in which an alternative that is similar, but inferior, to another alternative is added to the set. Findings from several experiments indicate that these <b>set</b> <b>configurations,</b> uniqueness and asymmetric dominance, can increase choice of a target alternative in complex tasks. A second key finding from this study is that asymmetric dominance can influence choice directly, as just discussed, and at a secondary level, or step. That is, an asymmetric dominance relationship among non-considered alternatives can influence choice among considered alternatives. To my knowledge, this type of secondary level <b>set</b> <b>configuration</b> effect has not been observed in the literature. Secondary level <b>set</b> <b>configuration</b> effects were moderated by task complexity (simple vs. complex) and product involvement (high vs. low) : secondary level effects were observed in higher involving, complex tasks. I argue that salience of an asymmetric dominance relationship leads to a comparison of considered alternatives to a non-considered, yet good alternative. This comparison can help consumers discriminate among the considered alternatives. Findings lend support to this suggested mechanism for secondary level <b>set</b> <b>configuration</b> effects. nhhph...|$|R
