40|$|This paper {{deals with}} leisure and non-schooling time, meant as {{informal}} {{educational opportunities for}} Italian young adolescents, more specifically with respect to identification and individuation processes which are {{at the base of}} it. Moreover, it is argued that leisure time, meant as time for the self might act as enhancing and increasing factor of cultural family capital, while under different conditions, on the contrary, it becomes a process of choice that spoils rather than it erodes the patrimony of ascribed cultural family resources, as similarly happens to formal educational choices. The paper aims to focus on the value attributed to leisure non schooling time by exploring to what extent and from what kind of contextual factors – in continuity or discontinuity with the meaning value attributed to school time – it might increase/erode/spoil the initial cultural patrimony. Such objective will move from the results of a recent national investigation “Life Chances and significant adults in the educational and professional choices of adolescents” (<b>ccord.</b> Prof. ssa Besozzi Elena, Catholic University of Milan). ...|$|R

40|$|Twenty-five Ss {{were shown}} 10 lists of words, each list {{followed}} by a free-recall test. Overt rehearsal of the word lists was required uring study and was tape-recorded. Three weeks later Ss returned for a recognition test on these words. Initial recall and three-week delayed recognition were increasing functions of amount of rehearsal <b>ccorded</b> the item. The prob-ability of delayed recognition decreased asa function of the initial serial study position, and appeared to increase {{as a function of}} its output position on initial recall. Further analysis of this latter esult suggested that delayed recognition first rises and then falls as a function of output position in initial recall. In a recent study by Craik (1970) Ss were presented with 10 lists of words with a single immediate free-recall test following each list. At the end of this series of trials a final test was given in which Ss were asked to recall as many words as possible from all of the preced-ing lists. Two interesting results emerged from the study. First there was a marked difference between the shapes of the serial position curves for immediate and final recall. The recency effect, which had been quite strong in immediate recall, was absent from final recall; in fact, final recall was found to decrease over serial input positions. The second result con-cerned the relationship between the prob-ability of recall on the final test and the posi-t ion of that item in S's initial output protocol: the later an item appeared in S's initial recall, the higher was its probabil ity of recall on the final test.

The risk of developing {{one or more of}} these obesity-related conditions is based on body mass index (BMI), with 25 – 30 kg/m 2 being low risk and 40 kg/m 2 being very high risk (2).

40|$|A <b>ccording</b> to the Alliance for Excellent Education (2005), {{one-third of}} {{entering}} ninth-grade students will {{drop out of}} high school before attaining a diploma, and another third will graduate unprepared for college or a good job. About half of the high schools in the nation’s 35 largest cities have severe dropout rates—often as high as 50 percent. Only about 30 percent of high school students read profi-ciently, and more than a quarter read significantly below grade level. To make matters worse, elementary and secondary teachers, critical for the success of these students, are themselves “dropping out ” of our nation’s schools. The National Commis-sion on Teaching and America’s Future estimates that a third of all new teachers leave after three years, and 46 percent leave within five years. The commission estimates that the teacher dropout rate has grown by 50 percent during the past 15 years at a cost of roughly $ 7 billion a year, as districts and states re-cruit, hire, and try to retain new teachers (Kopkowski, 2008). Teachers who leave the profession identify the following chal-lenges as precipitating factors: lack of planning time (65 per-cent), too heavy a workload (60 percent), and problematic stu-dent behavior (53 percent) (Alliance for Excellent Education...|$|E
40|$|A <b>ccording</b> to the American Cancer Society (ACS), {{lung cancer}} {{is the second most}} common {{diagnosis}} in the world and {{is the leading cause of}} death from malignancy in both men and women (ACS, 2014). Lung cancer accounts for 13 % of new diag-noses and 27 % of deaths from malig-nancy. The ACS (2014) estimated that in 2014, there were 224, 210 new cases of lung cancer and 159, 260 deaths. The death estimate is higher in lung cancer than in colon, prostate, and breast cancers combined (ACS, 2014). Lung cancer is divided into two types: small cell and non–small cell. Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common, accounting for 85 % to 90 % of all lung cancers (Gold-enberg, 2014). There are three primary histo-logic subtypes of NSCLC: squamous cell, adenocarcinoma, and large cell (ACS, 2014). Adenocarcinoma is the most common subtype. Research on adenocarcinomas has revealed sev-eral genetic mutations that have con-tributed to treatment response. One mutation in particular is the rearrangement of the anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) gene. The rearrangement forms a fusion gene between ALK and the echinoderm microtubule-as-sociated protein-like 4 (EML 4). The 5 ’ region of EML 4 fuses to the 3 ’ re-gion of ALK, creating the oncogen...|$|E
