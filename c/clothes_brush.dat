25|$|Lint on {{clothing}} {{is generally considered}} unattractive and unprofessional. Furthermore, lint may be abrasive and may damage the clothing itself. For this reason, visible lint is often removed with a lint remover or <b>clothes</b> <b>brush.</b> The accumulation of lint during clothes cleaning can be reduced {{with the use of}} a fabric softener, which reduces the amount of static electricity on clothing surfaces and therefore prevents the lint from sticking to the clothes.|$|E

60|$|Easton strolled {{quietly in}} {{and took his}} place, looking annoyingly fresh and clean {{by the side of}} those who had {{accompanied}} Skinner on his walk, and who, in spite of vigorous use of <b>clothes</b> <b>brushes,</b> showed signs of cross-country running.|$|R

60|$|Nikasti appeared, a {{few moments}} later. He was {{carrying}} a dress coat on his arm, and he held a <b>clothes</b> <b>brush</b> in his hand. It was obvious that he had studied with nice care {{the details of his}} new part.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shouldn't have blamed you either, you know. Most men after a bump {{like that}} might have been spiteful. The least I can do is to stand you a needle and thread. And a <b>clothes</b> <b>brush.</b> It isn't {{everyone}} who'd have taken it like you.|$|E

[...] "Now fetch a <b>clothes</b> <b>brush</b> and {{let me give you a}} good brushing, and you can take me out to lunch--that is to say, if you can find something decent to wear on your head," [...] she went on, pointing to a somewhat disreputable looking hat which hung behind the door. [...] "I won't go out with you in that." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was always}} busy; kept the rooms tidied up, the boots polished, the <b>clothes</b> <b>brushed,</b> the wash-basin full of clean water, my dress clothes laid out {{and ready for}} the lecture-hall an hour ahead of time; and he dressed me from head to heel {{in spite of my}} {{determination}} to do it myself, according to my lifelong custom.|$|R
50|$|In the mid 1970s, Wallachs held {{classes to}} {{instruct}} {{on how to}} tie a scarf. At one time Wallachs' customers and passersby were asked to come inside to have loose buttons sewn on or missing buttons replaced at no cost. Shoe laces, collar stays, hat bags, and feathers for hats were provided to shoppers who requested them. Additional free extras given out at retail counters included <b>clothes</b> <b>brushes</b> and identification tags which buttoned inside raincoats.|$|R

60|$|There were title {{deeds of}} the Piccadilly {{house in a}} great bundle, deeds of the {{purchase}} of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey, notepaper, envelopes, and pens and ink. All were covered up in thin wrapping paper to keep them from the dust. There were also a <b>clothes</b> <b>brush,</b> a brush and comb, and a jug and basin. The latter containing dirty water which was reddened as if with blood. Last of all was a little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to the other houses.|$|E
6000|$|She goes {{across to}} the bedroom on the Right, and soon returns with a [...] suit of pyjamas, a toothbrush, a pair of {{slippers}} and a case of [...] razors, which she puts on the table, and disappears into the [...] kitchen. She reappears with a bread pan, which she deposits in the [...] centre of the room; then crosses again to the bedroom, and once more [...] reappears with a <b>clothes</b> <b>brush,</b> two hair brushes, and a Norfolk [...] jacket. As she stuffs all these into the bread pan and bears it [...] back into the kitchen, there {{is the sound of}} a car driving up and [...] stopping. ANNIE reappears at the kitchen door just as the knocker [...] sounds.|$|E
6000|$|Him {{she must}} have wedded under {{considerable}} delusions. I do not think he deceived her, indeed, nor do I suspect him of mercenariness in their union; but no doubt he played up to her requirements in the half ingenuous way that {{was and still is}} the quality of most wooing, and presented himself as a very brisk and orthodox young man. I wonder why nearly all love-making has to be fraudulent. Afterwards he must have disappointed her cruelly by letting one aspect after another of his careless, sceptical, experimental temperament appear. Her mind was fixed and definite, she embodied all that confidence in church and decorum and the assurances of the pulpit which was characteristic of the large mass of the English people--for after all, the rather low-Church section WAS the largest single mass--in early Victorian times. She had dreams, I suspect, of going to church with him side by side; she in a little poke bonnet and a large flounced crinoline, all mauve and magenta and starched under a little lace-trimmed parasol, and he in a tall silk hat and peg-top trousers and a roll-collar coat, and looking rather like the Prince Consort,--white angels almost visibly raining benedictions on their amiable progress. Perhaps she dreamt gently of much-belaced babies and an interestingly pious (but not too dissenting or fanatical) little girl or boy or so, also angel-haunted. And I think, too, {{she must have}} seen herself ruling a seemly [...] "home of taste," [...] with a vivarium in the conservatory that opened out of the drawing-room, or again, making preserves in the kitchen. My father's science-teaching, his diagrams of disembowelled humanity, his pictures of prehistoric beasts that contradicted the Flood, his disposition towards soft shirts and loose tweed suits, his inability to use a <b>clothes</b> <b>brush,</b> his spasmodic reading fits and his bulldog pipes, must have jarred cruelly with her rather unintelligent anticipations. His wild moments of violent temper when he would swear and smash things, absurd almost lovable storms that passed like summer thunder, must have been starkly dreadful to her. She was constitutionally inadaptable, and certainly made no attempt to understand or tolerate these outbreaks. She tried them by her standards, and by her standards they were wrong. Her standards hid him from her. The blazing things he said rankled in her mind unforgettably.|$|E
60|$|The glass-blower, {{although}} miserably poor, hard-working and homely of feature, {{was a man}} of ideas. He suddenly recollected {{his precious}} medicine, and determined to use it to better advantage than relieving his own ills. He dressed himself in his best <b>clothes,</b> <b>brushed</b> his hair and combed his whiskers, washed his hands and tied his necktie, blackened his hoes and sponged his vest, and then put the vial of magic cure-all in his pocket. Next he locked his door, went downstairs and walked through the streets to the grand mansion where the wealthy Miss Mydas resided.|$|R
50|$|John Luke's {{painting}} {{technique was}} painstakingly slow, his manner precise. 'I'm afraid I'm {{very much a}} one job man,' he once wrote to John Hewitt, continuing: 'my strength lies in {{making the most of}} one job at a time, in sustained thought and effort, to bring it to the highest level of organisation and completeness I desire: the other way I lead to disintegrate in looseness and frustration with its inevitable weakness.' The precision characteristic of his work was manifested, too, in his appearance and personal manner. Dark haired, in stature he was erect and spare of build. Always tidy, his <b>clothes</b> <b>brushed,</b> his hair short, he was, in Hewitt's words, 'not at all close to the romantic stereotype of the artist'.|$|R
60|$|Ashurst {{contemplated}} his visage in a looking-glass. After his farmhouse bedroom, {{the comb}} and one spare shirt regime {{of the last}} fortnight, this room littered with <b>clothes</b> and <b>brushes</b> {{was a sort of}} Capua; and he thought: 'Queer--one doesn't realise But what--he did not quite know.|$|R

50|$|He was {{inadvertently}} {{caught up}} in a controversial incident, when Sid Barnes made way in the side for Flockton for a match at the Adelaide Oval. Barnes then acted as twelfth man, and appeared in a suit (rather than 'whites'), carrying unnecessary items such as cigars, iced towels, a mirror and comb, a radio and a <b>clothes</b> <b>brush.</b>|$|E
60|$|Cecil de la Borne was {{standing}} {{at the end of the}} drive when she appeared, a telescope in his hand. He came hastily down the road to meet her, a very slim and elegant figure in his well-cut flannel <b>clothes,</b> smoothly <b>brushed</b> hair, and irreproachable tie.|$|R
60|$|Quest, {{notwithstanding}} the unusual {{nature of his}} surroundings, slept that night as only a tired and healthy man can. He was awakened the next morning by the quiet movements of a man-servant who had brought back his <b>clothes</b> carefully <b>brushed</b> and pressed. He {{sat up in bed}} and discovered a small china tea equipage by his side.|$|R
60|$|I {{scarcely}} recognized Mr. Cullen when {{he first}} accosted me {{in the courtyard of}} the Milan. At no time of distinguished appearance, a certain carelessness of dress and gait had brought him now almost on a level with the loafer in the street. His <b>clothes</b> needed <b>brushing,</b> he was unshaved, and he looked altogether very much in need of a bath and a new outfit.|$|R

50|$|Cabinets were in {{the rear}} {{quarters}} beside the two rear seats; one held cocktail equipment, including cut glass decanters, glasses and thermos jugs, while the other held picnic equipment, including Perspex sandwich boxes, cups, saucers, and linen. A folding table was fitted in {{the centre of the}} front seat, a manicure set in the passenger door recess, and an ivory-handled nylon umbrella in {{the lower part of the}} passenger door. A sliding tray under the passenger side of the dashboard held a folding mirror, a <b>clothes</b> <b>brush,</b> a comb, a powder compact, a cigarette case, and a cream jar. The boot held rawhide suitcases with gilt Bramah locks.|$|E
5000|$|The space {{behind the}} seats had two red {{crocodile}} leather suitcases strapped down with matching straps {{attached to the}} floor. A shallow vanity drawer under the dashboard contained silver accessories, including a hinge-over mirror, a powder compact, a cigarette case, a lighter, and a <b>clothes</b> <b>brush.</b> The car had a radio, a heating and ventilating unit, an internal shutter to block the glass roof panel, detachable rear wheel spats, a washer system for the one-piece curved windscreen, a demister, and a speedometer marked to 120 mph. The headlights and pass lights were faired into the front wings {{in the same manner}} as Blue Clover or the Gold Car.|$|E
60|$|The saloon was now fast {{filling up}} {{by the arrival of}} other {{remarkable}} characters, among whom were noticed Davy Jones, the distinguished nautical personage, and a rude, carelessly dressed, harum-scarum sort of elderly fellow, known by the nickname of Old Harry. The latter, however, after being shown to a dressing-room, reappeared with his gray hair nicely combed, his <b>clothes</b> <b>brushed,</b> a clean dicky on his neck, and altogether so changed in aspect as to merit the more respectful appellation of Venerable Henry. Joel Doe and Richard Roe came arm in arm, accompanied by a Man of Straw, a fictitious indorser, and several persons who had no existence except as voters in closely contested elections. The celebrated Seatsfield, who now entered, was at first supposed to belong to the same brotherhood, until he made it apparent that he was a real man of flesh and blood and had his earthly domicile in Germany. Among the latest comers, as might reasonably be expected, arrived a guest from the far future.|$|R
60|$|He sprang out of bed, dressed quickly, hurried {{over his}} coffee and rolls, boarded a {{cross-town}} car, and arrived at the Monmouth House flats {{just in time to}} meet Martha Grimes issuing into the street. She was not at all the same Martha. She was very neatly dressed, her shoes were nicely polished, her <b>clothes</b> well <b>brushed,</b> her gloves new, and she wore a bunch of fresh-looking violets in her waistband. She started in surprise as Philip accosted her.|$|R
60|$|The {{stranger}} {{had taken}} from his valise of paper a comb, which he calmly proceeded to use, {{the water in the}} basin serving as a mirror; and then, to the surprise and disdain of the spectators, he gave his <b>clothes</b> a vigorous <b>brushing</b> with a whisk-broom.|$|R
5000|$|The secret radio {{transmitter}} {{disguised as a}} <b>clothes</b> <b>brush,</b> used by Kellman, is the very same prop that appears in the 1973 James Bond film Live and Let Die. The prop was handed over by Bond actor Roger Moore himself when he visited the BBC in 1973. He later told the Radio Times that the props master, not recognising Moore, had paid him two shillings and sixpence for the item: [...] "I'd popped into the Beeb BBC {{for a cup of}} tea and spotted a notice about an upcoming [...] "Doctor Who", so I thought the darlings would be so cash-strapped they'd need anything they could get their hands on. It wasn't MGM, after all. But I didn't expect to walk out with two and six!" ...|$|E
50|$|The seating {{was similar}} to that of Green Goddess, with a three-passenger front bench and two rear {{armchairs}} with folding backs to extend luggage space when not in use. The seats were upholstered in lavender blue leather with dark blue piping. Instead of wooden veneers, the interior was finished with grey-blue lizard skins. These skins covered the steering wheels, the inside door panels, the cabinets {{on either side of the}} rear armchairs, and the manicure set fitted into the left door. The cabinets in the back contained a flask and glasses made of cut glass, a silver Thermos flask, sandwich boxes, cups, saucers, and linen, while recesses above the rear seat held an 8 mm motion picture camera and a pair of field glasses. A tray under the instrument panel held a mirror, a comb, a <b>clothes</b> <b>brush,</b> two silver-topped jars, and a powder compact. The floor was covered with Nylon carpets.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this work, {{the use of}} a nanocrystallization surface {{treatment}} is considered on a cobalt based alloy. Since the Co 28 Cr 6 Mo is widely used as an articular bearing surface for artificial joints like hip and knee prostheses, the improvement of its tribological properties is a matter of concern to extend the lifespan of implants. By means of SMA (Surface Mechanical Attrition) treatment, a nanostructured layer is formed at the surface of a CoCrMo alloy establishing an optimized hardness gradient down to a depth of a few hundred of microns. Different treatment times (5, 15 and 25 minutes) are assessed comparatively and several surface polishing methods are studied: with <b>clothes,</b> <b>brushes</b> and a liquid filled with abrasive particles. The influence of processing parameters is discussed regarding hardness and topography. Moreover, the impact of surface modification is examined in terms of wear strengthening through scratch testing. The use of increasing loads mode gives some evidence of the benefit of SMAT. A significant decrease of penetration depth is noticed, from 30 % to 60 % on average. A straight correlation is also noticed depending on the surface finish method. This study illustrates both the ability of micro scratch testing to assess comparatively treated surface layer and to highlight the benefit of SMAT for wear strengthening in an abrasive wear mode...|$|R
60|$|When {{at length}} I did wake up, {{the first thing}} I saw was Anscombe already dressed, engaged in {{cleaning}} my <b>clothes</b> with a <b>brush</b> from his toilet case. I remember thinking how smart and incongruous that dressing-bag, made appropriately enough of crocodile hide, looked in this Kaffir hut with its silver-topped bottles and its ivory-handled razors.|$|R
6000|$|The {{staircase}} and passage {{seemed to have}} grown shabbier and meaner as Paul, slowly and hesitatingly, descended to the street. At {{the foot of the}} stairs he paused irresolutely, and loitered with a vague idea of turning back on some pretense, only that he might relieve himself of the sense of desertion. He had already determined upon making that inquiry into the colonel's personal and pecuniary affairs which he had not dared to offer personally, and had a half-formed plan of testing his own power and popularity in a certain line of relief that at once satisfied his sympathies and ambitions. Nevertheless, after reaching the street, he lingered a moment, when an odd idea of temporizing with his inclinations struck him. At the farther end of the hotel--one of the parasites living on its decayed fortunes--was a small barber's shop. By having his hair trimmed and his <b>clothes</b> <b>brushed</b> he could linger a little longer beneath the same roof with the helpless solitary, and perhaps come to some conclusion. He entered the clean but scantily furnished shop, and threw himself into one of the nearest chairs, hardly noting that there were no other customers, and that a single assistant, stropping a razor behind a glass door, was the only occupant. But there was a familiar note of exaggerated politeness about the voice of this man as he opened the door and came towards the back of the chair with the formula:-- ...|$|R
