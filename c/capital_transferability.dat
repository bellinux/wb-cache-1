30|$|The {{explanations}} for such mismatches are multifold. The overqualification of these migrants might derive from poor {{recognition of their}} skills in the German labor market, from German-specific human capital that these migrants lack, from imperfect human <b>capital</b> <b>transferability</b> across borders, or from the lower quality of the degrees obtained.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{transferability}} of human capital across {{countries and the}} contribution of imperfect human capital portability to the explanation of the immigrant-native wage gap. Using data for West Germany, our results reveal that, overall, education and in particular labor market experience accumulated in the home countries of the immigrants receive signifiantly lower returns than human capital obtained in Germany. We further find evidence for heterogeneity in the returns to human capital of immigrants across countries. Finally, imperfect human <b>capital</b> <b>transferability</b> {{appears to be a}} major factor in explaining the wage differential between natives and immigrants...|$|E
40|$|Using two Dutch {{labour force}} surveys, we compare {{employment}} assimilation of immigrants by source country, after ranking countries by presumed social-cultural distance to The Netherlands. We test this ranking of human <b>capital</b> <b>transferability</b> on the ranking by initial performance dip at entry as an immigrant {{and speed of}} assimilation {{as measured by the}} slope on years-since-migration. We also test the predicted association between entry gap and speed of assimilation (faster assimilation if the initial dip is larger). Both hypotheses are largely supported. Most immigrant groups never reach parity with native Dutch, neither in (un-) employment probability nor in job quality, and certainly not within 25 years after arrival...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} model to analyze the {{determinants}} and effects of an endogenous imperfect <b>transferability</b> of human <b>capital</b> on natives and immigrants. The model reveals that high migration flows and high skill-transferability are mutually interdependent. Moreover, we show that high mobility within a Federation is necessary to attract highly skilled immigrants into the Federation. We study in how far and in what way the European public policy behind the Bologna and the Lisbon Process can contribute to higher mobility in Europe. human <b>capital,</b> migration, <b>transferability,</b> public policy...|$|R
30|$|This paper adopts the {{framework}} used by several {{studies in the}} migration literature. The migration literature is vast, and many studies analyze the preferences of “actual” migrants over alternative destination choices. The majority of the papers analyze migration flows across countries and combine these data with country-level information on both the home and host countries (Mayda [2010] and De Giorgi and Pellizzari [2009]). Most papers find that human <b>capital</b> and its <b>transferability</b> are the main explanatory factors for {{the choice of a}} particular destination location.|$|R
40|$|Human {{capital is}} a key {{resource}} for which firms compete intensely. Human capital theory suggests that firms value both transferable and specific human <b>capital.</b> Yet as <b>transferability</b> increases, specificity decreases. This article examines the value firms place on acquiring executives’ human capital {{as a function of}} its transferability versus specificity. Using longitudinal data from more than 9, 000 executives, this article shows that executives moving to more similar firms receive greater increases to pay than nonmovers and those moving to less similar firms. This article suggests these increases reflect the differential value associated with various types of human capital...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} the complex relationship between migration and {{education in the}} context of recent intra-European labour mobility. It considers how this mobility impacts the education and life chances of migrant students attending schools in Scotland, UK. By examining the experiences of Polish migrant children and youth at schools in Scotland, the article engages with the issues of language, cultural <b>capital</b> <b>transferability</b> and social positioning. Drawing on qualitative data from 65 in-depth interviews with school children aged 5 – 17 [*]years, their parents and teachers, as well as observations in the contexts of school and home, the article points to a range of factors affecting the transition of migrant pupils to new schools and social environments...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} impact of job entry {{restrictions}} on the economic integration of recent ethnic German immigrants, using twelve waves of the German Socio-Economic Panel. The German labor market closely ties job accessibility to vocational education which likely hampers the transferability of foreign human capital. To assess this effect, we compare the job mismatch probabilities of ethnic German immigrants and German natives and the employment probability in jobs that vary by the qualifications they require. Our results suggest that ethnic Germans are disadvantaged upon arrival, yet almost completely assimilate to comparable natives considering these two job quality measures. Furthermore, controlling for these factors explains a considerable share of the earnings gap between ethnic and native Germans.

40|$|Do {{apprenticeships}} convey mainly {{general or}} also firm- and occupation-specific human capital? Specific human capital may allow for specialization gains, {{but may also}} lead to allocative inefficiency due to mobility barriers. We analyse the case of Switzerland, which combines a comprehensive, high-quality apprenticeship system with a lightly regulated labour market. To assess human <b>capital</b> <b>transferability</b> after standardized firm-based apprenticeship training, we analyse inter-firm and occupational mobility and their effects on post-training wages. Using a longitudinal data set based on the PISA 2000 survey, we find high inter-firm and low occupational mobility within one year after graduation. Accounting for endogenous changes, we find a negative effect of occupation changes on wages, but no significant wage effect for firm changes. This indicates that occupation-specific human capital {{is an important component}} of apprenticeship training and that skills are highly transferable within an occupational fiel...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} a {{comparison}} between a private company limited by shares governed by English law and a limited liability company governed by Czech law. The aim of the thesis is to identify their main distinguishable features and compare them between the companies. The methodology behind this paper is therefore mainly comparative analysis. The paper {{is divided into two}} main parts. The first section discusses the regulation of the private company limited by shares and its main features distinguishing the company from other companies existing in English law. The company is also compared with the limited liability company in Czech law. The main features of the company are considered: a) the company is "private" b) it is a limited company c) the company is limited by shares. There is also a chapter concerning a separate legal personality of the company. The second part adresses the limited liability company governing by Czech law. There are several features of the company separated into chapters. The first two chapters are concerned with the historical background and general characteristics of the company. The following chapters discuss the main features which individualize the company in the Czech company law. These are focused on share capital, contributed <b>capital,</b> a <b>transferability</b> of shares, [...] ...|$|R
30|$|Becker’s {{main purpose}} in the {{development}} of the book evolved from an empirical one to an increasingly theoretical one. Becker became increasingly focused on developing a general theory of human capital investment and not merely on assessing the profitability of those investments. That included an explanatory framework for the shape of age-earning profiles, the concentration of human capital investment at earlier ages, and the personal distribution of income, on the basis of the process of accumulation of human capital, and extending Mincer’s work on personal distribution of earnings by relating the distribution of earnings explicitly to rates of return and investment costs (see Mincer [1957], [1962]). As indicated in his 1962 paper, Becker started his analysis by focusing on the hitherto largely overlooked on-the-job training. The emphasis on this type of capital was justified for its importance among types of human <b>capital</b> and the <b>transferability</b> of the analysis for other types of human capital. He therefore tried to investigate the economic decision-making process regulating the quantity of and time spent in training, which was an important link with the work being developed by Mincer (Teixeira [2007], [2011]).|$|R
30|$|While {{not without}} limitation, the {{findings}} in this paper still significantly enhance {{our understanding of the}} importance of occupational human <b>capital,</b> particularly skills <b>transferability</b> in earnings losses determination. This paper’s findings on earnings losses due to job displacement have important implications for researchers, policy makers, and the public. For future research, it sheds light on the role of occupational human capital in determining earnings losses after job displacement. In fact, the results show that displaced workers also receive compensation that is not completely general or specific to a particular firm, but rather specific to occupation. The findings from this paper highlight the importance of occupational specific human capital in the employment relationship; losing these types of skills might result in substantial losses to the displaced worker’s earnings. In addition, previous research on this topic used a dummy variable indicating whether displaced workers remained in the same occupation as their pre-displacement job and ignored the fact that occupational skills could be (partially) transferable across occupations. However, using the continuous variable of skills transferability, the results from this paper indicate that if displaced workers could find occupations that are very similar, if not exactly the same, as their old jobs, they could transfer most of their previous occupational skills to the new job and their earnings losses would be reduced. Moreover, the findings present that the measure of skills transferability is a better measure of occupational human capital than the dummy variable of switching occupations. Thus, those performing future research regarding occupational human capital should consider applying this measure to other outcome variables as well. For example, this paper only examines the effect of occupational skill transferability on the loss of earnings between pre- and post-displacement occupations and does not consider the effect on other types of benefits. Thus, it might be interesting for future research to investigate the effect of occupational human capital, especially the skills transferability, on total compensation, which also includes other benefits such as health insurance and pension (Podgursky and Swaim 1987).|$|R
40|$|Despite {{having one}} of the most celebrated labor market {{integration}} policies, the native immigrant employment gap in Sweden {{is one of the largest}} among the OECD countries. In this study, we use unique Swedish register data to try to explain the employment gap between male immigrants and natives. The results show that the traditional human capital theory only explains a small share of the immigrant-native gap. After controlling for human capital, demographic and contextual factors, large unexplained employment gaps still persists between immigrants and natives and between migrant categories. Our analysis indicates that admission category is an important determinant of employment integration, and that humanitarian and family migrants suffer from low transferability of their country specific human capital. The article highlights the need to consider migrant categories in integration research, and take into account international human <b>capital</b> <b>transferability</b> when explaining employment outcomes for immigrants...|$|E
40|$|In {{the paper}} {{we use a}} unique new data set which has been {{collected}} in late 2006 in Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine to investigate the determinants for short term migration and its destination and duration patterns. Special {{attention is paid to}} the role played by personal networks to Eastern and Western destinations as well as investments into the transferability of human capital made by migrants prior to their stay abroad. We find that many determinants and migration patterns are quite similar across the CIS countries under consideration but exhibit some surprising differences to standard results from the migration literature, e. g. the prevalence of older migrants and the low importance of children in the migration decision process. Networks and human <b>capital</b> <b>transferability</b> are the main explaining factors for the migration and destination decision, a result proofing robust after correcting for endogeneity. We expect that migration is likely to grow in importance for some countries at the European Borderlands, as networks develop and the costs of migration decrease. However, our analysis reveals that fears of brain drain have little substance as the educational background of migrants is rather low. As a considerable number of migrants have invested into destination country specific human capital prior to migration, this improved human capital endowment can benefit both, migrants and the society of sending countries, alike.

30|$|These {{models have}} been {{extended}} to consider the mismatch of immigrants compared to those of natives 6. All studies show that immigrants {{are much more likely}} to be mismatched (generally over-educated) than their native counterparts. There are several arguments put forward for that. For instance, Chiswick and Miller ([2008]); [2009], for analyses of Australia and the US, argue that the main reason for immigrant education mismatch is the less than perfect human <b>capital</b> <b>transferability</b> across borders, especially for those who migrate from less developed countries and/or those who have low host country language skills. Similarly, Green et al. ([2007]) use the LSIA to show that immigrants in Australia {{are much more likely to}} be over-educated than the natives and the difference is more pronounced for those coming from non-English speaking backgrounds. One other explanation put forward by Battu and Sloane ([2004]) is the possible discrimination against non-whites in the UK labour market, where they compare mismatch for ethnic minorities with those for white natives 7. They argue that ethnic minorities possibly find it difficult to acquire jobs and therefore are likely to work in an occupation that is not fully commensurate with their qualification. Hence, on average more non-whites end up being over-educated. In other words, one can argue that to be able to send a stronger signal of ability, immigrants acquire more education, compared to natives, for the same job. Finally, some unobservable factors like motivation and innate abilities might be the reasons behind the results obtained in all studies analysing the labour market mismatch for immigrants (see Chiswick and Miller [2009]).|$|E
