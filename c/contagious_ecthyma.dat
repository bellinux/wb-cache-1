40|$|Abstract Background Two {{outbreaks}} {{of the disease}} <b>contagious</b> <b>ecthyma</b> were reported in 1999 and 2000 in Norwegian semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus). <b>Contagious</b> <b>ecthyma</b> is an epidermal disease of sheep and goats worldwide, which {{is caused by the}} zoonotic parapoxvirus orf virus. Characterisation of clinical samples from the two outbreaks in semi-domesticated reindeer in Norway by electron microscopy and PCR (B 2 L) revealed typical parapoxvirus particles and partial gene sequences corresponding to parapoxvirus, respectively. If <b>contagious</b> <b>ecthyma</b> in reindeer is caused by orf virus, the virus may be transferred from sheep and goats, via people, equipment and common use of pastures and corrals, to reindeer. Another possibility is that <b>contagious</b> <b>ecthyma</b> in reindeer is caused by a hitherto unclassified member of the parapoxvirus genus that circulates among reindeer herds and remains endemic in Norway. Results Genomic comparisons of one standard orf strain (orf NZ 2) and the reindeer isolates, employing restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, demonstrated high similarity between the reindeer viruses and known orf virus strains. Partial DNA sequences of two different viral genes were determined for the different isolates and compared with corresponding parapoxvirus genebank sequences. The comparison/alignment and construction of phylogenetic trees also point to an affiliation of the reindeer viruses to the species orf virus. Conclusion The results of this work imply that the parapoxvirus causing <b>contagious</b> <b>ecthyma</b> in Norwegian semi-domesticated reindeer belongs to the species orf virus and that the orf virus crosses the host species barrier from sheep and goat to semi-domesticated reindeer. </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Contagious</b> <b>ecthyma</b> is {{a highly}} contagious, zoonotic, viral skin disease that affects sheep, goats and some other domesticated and wild ruminants. The skin lesions are painful and often occur on the mouth and muzzle, where they can cause {{anorexia}} or starvation. Lesions on the udder may result in the abandonment of offspring, and foot lesions can cause transient lameness. Secondary bacterial infections can occur and, in rare cases, the lesions may extend into the internal organs. Severe generalized infections have been described in Boer and Boer cross goats. Although <b>contagious</b> <b>ecthyma</b> usually resolves spontaneously and the mortality rate is generally low, fatality rates up to 10 % have been reported. Most infections in humans are localized and heal spontaneously; however, large, poorly healing lesions can occur in people who are immunosuppressed. Etiology <b>Contagious</b> <b>ecthyma</b> results from infection by the orf virus, {{a member of the}} genus Parapoxvirus in the family Poxviridae. Geographic Distribution <b>Contagious</b> <b>ecthyma</b> has been found worldwide in all countries that raise sheep. In the U. S., this disease is seen most often in the Western states. Transmission The orf virus, which is found in skin lesions and scabs, is thought to enter the skin through cuts and abrasions. This virus can be carried by clinically normal sheep as well as sick animals. It can be transmitted by direct contact or on fomites. The orf virus remains viable on the wool and hides for approximately one month after the lesions have healed. It is very resistant to inactivation in the environment and has been recovered from dried crusts after 12 years. <b>Contagious</b> <b>ecthyma</b> vaccines contain live virus and can infect humans. Recently vaccinated animals can also transmit infections to humans. Disinfection The best disinfectants for the poxviruses are detergents, hypochlorite, alkalis, Virkon ® and glutaraldehyde...|$|E

30|$|Orf, {{also known}} as <b>contagious</b> <b>ecthyma</b> or scabby mouth, is a non-systemic, {{ubiquitous}} disease of sheep and goats caused by the orf virus (ORFV).

The disease is characterized by pustular lesions around the mouth and nostrils. Although the mortality rate is low in adult animals, the morbidity rate is high.

A live attenuated vaccine was produced by the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise ‘G. Caporale’. Quality control was performed in accordance with the European Pharmacopoeia. A wild virus strain was attenuated through serial passages on primary chicken embryo fibroblast tissue cultures. The virus suspension was treated according to standard procedures and freeze dried. The immunising dose was 1 ml containing 104, 5 TCID 50, administered intramuscularly. The safety of the vaccine was successfully tested by intramuscular inoculation of 20 susceptible sheep and 20 lambs with the routine dose, 10 times the immunising dose and two normal doses administered at seven-day intervals. The efficacy of the vaccine was tested using three groups of susceptible animals. The first group included 10 lambs and the second 10 adult sheep; the animals were immunised intramuscularly with 1 ml of the reconstituted vaccine.

40|$|Abstract Background ORFV {{attenuated}} live vaccines {{have been}} the main prophylactic measure against <b>contagious</b> <b>ecthyma</b> in sheep and goats in the last decades, which {{play an important role}} in preventing the outbreak of the disease. However, the available vaccines do not induce lasting immunity in sheep and goats. On the other hand, variation in the terminal genome of Orf virus vaccine strains during cell culture adaptation may affect the efficacy of a vaccine. Currently, there are no more effective antiviral treatments available for <b>contagious</b> <b>ecthyma.</b> Results We constructed three eukaryotic expression vectors pcDNA 3. 1 -ORFV 011, pcDNA 3. 1 -ORFV 059 and pcDNA 3. 1 -ORFV 011 /ORFV 059 and tested their immunogenicity in mouse model. High level expression of the recombinant proteins ORFV 011, ORFV 059 and ORFV 011 /ORFV 059 was confirmed by western blotting analysis and indirect fluorescence antibody (IFA) tests. The ORFV-specific antibody titers and serum IgG 1 /IgG 2 a titers, the proliferation of lymphocytes and ORFV-specific cytokines (IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α) were examined to evaluate the immune responses of the vaccinated mice. We found that mice inoculated with pcDNA 3. 1 -ORFV 011 /ORFV 059 had significantly stronger immunological responses than those inoculated with pcDNA 3. 1 -ORFV 011, pcDNA 3. 1 -ORFV 059, or pcDNA 3. 1 -ORFV 011 plus pcDNA 3. 1 -ORFV 059. Compared to other vaccine plasmids immunized groups, pcDNA 3. 1 -ORFV 011 /ORFV 059 immunized group enhances immunogenicity. Conclusions We concluded that DNA vaccine pcDNA 3. 1 -ORFV 011 /ORFV 059 expressing ORFV 011 and ORFV 059 chemeric-proteins can significantly improve the potency of DNA vaccination and could be served as more effective and safe approach for new vaccines against ORFV. </p...|$|E

Methods and Results The OPV/PPV nested-multiplex PCR was developed based on the evaluation and combination of published primer sets, and was applied to the detection of the target pathogens. The method showed high sensitivity, and the specificity was confirmed by amplicon sequencing. Exanthematic lesion samples collected during bovine vaccinia or <b>contagious</b> <b>ecthyma</b> outbreaks were submitted to OPV/PPV nested-multiplex PCR and confirmed its applicability. Conclusion These results suggest that the presented multiplex PCR provides a highly robust and sensitive method to detect OPV and PPV directly from clinical samples. The method can be used for viral identification and monitoring, especially in areas where OPV and PPV co-circulate. </p...|$|E
