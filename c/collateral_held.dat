40|$|The authors build a {{theoretical}} model that generates demand for collateral by Large Value Transfer System (LVTS) participants {{under the assumption}} that they minimize the cost of holding and managing collateral for LVTS purposes. The model predicts that the optimal amount of <b>collateral</b> <b>held</b> by each LVTS participant depends on the opportunity cost of collateral, the transactions costs of acquiring assets used as collateral and transferring them {{in and out of the}} LVTS, and the distribution of an LVTS participant's payment flows in the LVTS. The authors conclude that the aggregate amount of collateral pledged to the LVTS is quite close to that predicted by the model, when benchmark values are used for opportunity and transactions costs that are based on anecdotal evidence, despite the fact that these costs are likely to vary among participants. If one LVTS participant that appears to face a lower opportunity cost of collateral is excluded from the analysis, the model predicts an aggregate level of collateral that is within 5 per cent of the amount actually held by LVTS participants, on average, between February 1999 and May 2003. The authors also apply panel-data regressions to the level of <b>collateral</b> <b>held</b> in the LVTS. They find that the results are broadly supportive of the theoretical model. Sensitivity analysis of this model indicates that, when the opportunity cost of collateral increases, the amount of collateral that participants hold could be greatly reduced. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} why credit constraints {{for domestic}} and exporting firms arise {{in a setting}} where banks do not observe firms' productivities. To maintain incentive-compatibility, banks lend below the amount needed for first-best production. The longer time needed for export shipments induces a tighter credit constraint on exporters than on purely domestic firms, even in the exporters' home market. Greater risk faced by exporters also affects the credit extended by banks. Extra fixed costs reduce exports on the extensive margin, but can be offset by <b>collateral</b> <b>held</b> by exporting firms. The empirical application to Chinese firms strongly supports these theoretical results, and we find a sizable impact {{of the financial crisis}} in reducing exports. ...|$|E

We specifically allow for debtor opportunism vis-à-vis a non-co-ordinated group of creditors, in form of repeated strategic renegotiation offers and default threats. We show that the creditors initial entitlement to non-collateralized assets will be expropriated through exchange offers. Exchange offers successively increase the level of collateral until all assets are fully collateralised. The ex ante optimal debt contract is neither fully collateralised nor without any <b>collateral.</b> Diffusely <b>held</b> debt allows for a larger debt capacity and bears lower credit risk premia than privately held debt.

We derive distinct liquidity, collateral, and asset liquidation constraints, which determine whether a run can occur as a result of changing market expectations. We show that the extent to which borrowers can ward off an individual run depends on whether it has sufficient liquidity, collateral, and asset liquidation capacity. These determinants are endogenous and depend on the borrower's balance sheet, in terms of asset market exposure and leverage, and on fundamentals, such as productivity and size. Moreover, systemic runs are possible if shocks to the valuation of <b>collateral</b> <b>held</b> by outside investors are sufficiently strong and uniform, and if the system as a whole is exposed to high short-term funding risk...|$|E

40|$|Several {{government}} {{programs have been}} introduced in the United States {{in response to the}} financial crisis. We examine the impact of responses involving Treasury debt on short-term money markets to provide an understanding of cross-policydynamics. Specifically, we study the Term Securities Liquidity Facility (TSLF) [...] designed to address dislocations in repurchase (repo) rates by exchanging Treasury securities for poorer quality <b>collateral</b> <b>held</b> by market participants; the Supplemental Financing Program (SFP) [...] designed to help the Federal Reserve drain bank reserves through the issuance of special Treasury debt, with proceeds held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; Open Market Operations (OMOs) involving Treasury debt; and Treasury issuance which increased in response to cyclical fiscal policy, and due to programs such as the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and Treasury’s Agency mortgage-backed security (MBS) purchase program. Our contribution is to consider each policy in light of the others, both to help guide policy response to future crises and to emphasize policy interactions as only the TSLF was designed to directly address stresses in short-term money markets.

40|$|Banks often rely on {{collateralised}} {{intraday liquidity}} {{from the central}} bank {{in order to be}} able to effect payments in a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) payment system. If a bank is holding insufficient eligible collateral in a particular country, and therefore cannot obtain credit from the local central bank, it may have to delay payments. This constitutes a liquidity risk to the system. Furthermore, a bank operating in multiple systems may face a mismatch between the location of its collateral holdings and liquidity needs. In this paper, we examine the extent to which the liquidity risk arising from such a mismatch may be mitigated by allowing cross-border use of collateral. We develop a two-country, two-bank model in which risk-neutral banks minimise expected costs with respect to their collateral choice in each country. In our baseline model, in which each bank faces a liquidity need in only one country, we find that liquidity risk is indeed reduced by cross-border use of collateral. This result holds despite the fact that banks may find it optimal to economise on their total holdings of collateral. However, when we extend the model to allow for the possibility that a bank faces liquidity needs in both countries simultaneously, the total quantum of <b>collateral</b> <b>held</b> is important. Indeed, when a bank finds it optimal to reduce its total holdings, there may be an increase in liquidity risk in at least one country when simultaneous liquidity demands are realised. ...|$|E

40|$|Default risk is an {{important}} concern for lenders and is a main reason they require borrowers to pledge collateral. There are two reasons for this. The 8 ̆ 5 rst is that collateral provides some incentive for the borrower to not strategically default. The second is that, {{in the event of}} default, the lender can liquidate the collateral and salvage some value from the failed credit relationship. This paper provides a model to study properties of allocations that arise when collateral is part of an optimal lending contract that looks much like a repurchase agreement. In particular, a lack of commitment to future actions implies that collateral must be used to alleviate strategic default. Moreover, because <b>collateral</b> is <b>held</b> by lenders during the credit relationship, there is also a potential incentive for lenders to default on returning collateralized assets.

40|$|Under section 9 - 201 of the Uniform Commercial Code, a {{security}} interest in inventory is effective {{between the parties}} to {{a security}} agreement against purchasers of the collateral and creditors. However, under the massive exception to this general provision contained in section 9 - 307 (1), a buyer in the ordinary course of the seller 2 ̆ 7 s business takes the goods free of the security interest even if perfected and 2 ̆ 2 even though the buyer knows of its existence. 2 ̆ 2 The protections afforded the buyer in ordinary course under section 9 - 307 (1) are based on notions of fairness and commercial utility. Where an innocent buyer has relied on his seller 2 ̆ 7 s apparent authority to sell the goods, {{it is thought that}} such a purchaser has the right to avoid being harassed by his seller 2 ̆ 7 s inventory financer. Furthermore, where goods serving as loan <b>collateral</b> are <b>held</b> for sale, the seller must be given the power to sell if he is to meet the obligations imposed under the financing agreement. The question of whether goods have been sold to a buyer in ordinary course is critical to a determination of the rights in the collateral of the buyer and the secured party. Where goods have been sold to a buyer in ordinary course, the secured party cannot exercise foreclosure and sale remedies against the defaulting seller 2 ̆ 7 s inventory to satisfy the seller 2 ̆ 7 s debt. On the other hand, if goods are sold to one who does not qualify as a buyer in ordinary course, the buyer has no claim to the seller 2 ̆ 7 s inventory and will be forced to recover any prior payments of the purchase price on the same basis as the seller 2 ̆ 7 s general creditors. The most often applied alternatives for determining the point at which a buyer achieves ordinary course status include: (1) the initial contract date, (2) the identification date, or (3) the title date; however, other possibilities include: (4) the delivery date, and (5) the acceptance date as provided in section 2 - 606. This Note examines the decisions adopting the various alternatives for determining when a sale has progressed sufficiently to establish buyer in ordinary course status. An interpretational test under the present Code, and a Code amendment is proposed for the determination of when a buyer becomes a buyer in ordinary course...|$|R
5000|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature of a tri-party repo {{is that a}} custodian bank or international clearing organization, the tri-party agent, acts as an intermediary {{between the two parties}} to the repo. The tri-party agent is responsible for the administration of the transaction including collateral allocation, marking to market, and substitution of collateral. In the US, the two principal tri-party agents are The Bank of New York Mellon and JP Morgan Chase, whilst in Europe the principal tri-party agents are Euroclear and Clearstream with SIX offering services in the Swiss market. The size of the US tri-party repo market peaked in 2008 before the worst effects of the crisis at approximately $2.8 trillion and by mid-2010 was about $1.6 trillion.As tri-party agents administer the equivalent of hundreds of billions of USD of global collateral, they have the scale to subscribe to multiple data feeds to maximise the universe of coverage. As part of a tri-party agreement the three parties to the agreement, the tri-party agent, the repo buyer (the Collateral Taker/Cash Provider, [...] "CAP") and the repo seller (Cash Borrower/Collateral Provider, [...] "COP") agree to a collateral management service agreement which includes an [...] "eligible collateral profile". It is this [...] "eligible collateral profile" [...] that enables the repo buyer to define their risk appetite in respect of the collateral that they are prepared to hold against their cash. For example, a more risk averse repo buyer may wish to only hold [...] "on-the-run" [...] government bonds as collateral. In the event of a liquidation event of the repo seller the collateral is highly liquid thus enabling the repo buyer to sell the collateral quickly. A less risk averse repo buyer may be prepared to take non investment grade bonds or equities as collateral, which may be less liquid and may suffer a higher price volatility {{in the event of a}} repo seller default, making it more difficult for the repo buyer to sell the collateral and recover their cash. The tri-party agents are able to offer sophisticated collateral eligibility filters which allow the repo buyer to create these [...] "eligible collateral profiles" [...] which can systemically generate collateral pools which reflect the buyers risk appetite. Collateral eligibility criteria could include asset type, issuer, currency, domicile, credit rating, maturity, index, issue size, average daily traded volume, etc. Both the lender (repo buyer) and borrower (repo seller) of cash enter into these transactions to avoid the administrative burden of bi-lateral repos. In addition, because the <b>collateral</b> is being <b>held</b> by an agent, counterparty risk is reduced. A tri-party repo may be seen as the outgrowth of the due bill repo. A due bill repo is a repo in which the collateral is retained by the Cash borrower and not delivered to the cash provider. There is an increased element of risk when compared to the tri-party repo as collateral on a due bill repo is held within a client custody account at the Cash Borrower rather than a collateral account at a neutral third party.|$|R
