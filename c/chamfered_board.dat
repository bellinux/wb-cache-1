5000|$|Lonsdale House {{is located}} in Boundary Street, Spring Hill, close to the {{intersection}} with St Paul's Terrace, on a small elevated block overlooking central Brisbane. It is a two-storeyed timber house with attic rooms, with double-storey verandahs to front (south) and back (north) elevations, and single-storey extensions to the rear. The exterior is clad with 12" [...] deep pine <b>chamfer</b> <b>boards.</b> Built on a slope running west-east, the house is partly high-set on timber stumps or replacement concrete stumps. Because of {{the slope of the}} land, there are stairs on the western side leading from the street to the [...] "ground" [...] level front verandah.|$|R
50|$|The toilet block, {{located about}} 7m {{to the north}} of the kitchen, is a narrow {{rectangle}} in plan. Its roof is hipped and clad in corrugated iron. The fascias are simply scalloped timber. The building sits on low timber stumps and its interior can be accessed, on one long side, via a short flight of timber steps. On the other long side, the ground is essentially level with the floor of the building. The wall framing is exposed, and <b>chamfer</b> <b>boards</b> line the interior. There are a number of small timber-framed windows, one of which has a single awning sash. A concrete encased sewerage line attaches to one short end of the structure.|$|R
50|$|The {{administration}} {{building is a}} timber; six room former residential building with a pyramidal corrugated iron roof. The building is constructed on brick piers. <b>Chamfer</b> <b>boards</b> clad the external walls and verandah roof. The structure is exposed wooden stud framing to the verandah side with beaded lining boards facing the rooms. The building has an encircling verandah, which has been sheeted in with fibre cement sheet, timber trellis work and windows, and doors, which have been added at a relatively recent date. The verandah has a curved corrugated iron roof. The former service block {{at the rear of}} the building, which adjoins the south-west portion of the verandah, is a timber framed fibre cement sheet slatted timber structure with a corrugated iron skillion roof.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{section of}} the building is constructed from adze cut, unpainted vertical timber slabs housed in painted timber bearers at the base and top of the walls. The building has a corrugated iron clad gabled roof, steeply pitched over the rooms and changing to a more gradual pitch over {{the front and rear}} verandah. At the south eastern end of this section, projecting from the original dining room which was at this end, is another fireplace formed from bricks clad with corrugated iron sheeting projecting {{from the end of the}} building. Adjoining the dining room on the north eastern side is a skillion roofed and timber framed extension clad with horizontal <b>chamfered</b> <b>boards.</b> Most of this {{section of the}} residence is elevated only very slightly from the ground level, although a gentle tapering downwards to the north west necessitates open tread timber steps providing access to the south western verandah.|$|R
50|$|There are sixteen timber {{buildings}} {{within the}} heritage register boundary, {{some of which}} were constructed at West Point and later moved and re-assembled at Cape Pallarenda. The buildings are set within a green rainforest setting which contributes to the tropical ambience of the site. The buildings are timber framed and clad with vertical <b>chamfered</b> timber <b>boards.</b> The buildings are supported on concrete stumps.|$|R
50|$|The present {{house is}} {{essentially}} rectangular in plan. Its sits {{low to the}} ground and has a hipped roof clad in corrugated iron. Its long facades are oriented east and west. The walls are clad in <b>chamfer</b> <b>boards.</b> A long verandah extending approximately three quarters of the length of the house opens to the east. Its edge is defined by square timber columns, between which are fitted canvas blinds and low timber benches. Two sets of casements windows open off this facade; one has four sashes, and the other three. All sashes have four lights. Three sets of French doors open onto the verandah, each door having five lights. There is a bank of awning windows on the western facade. Each column has three awning sashes in it. The covered walkway leading to the kitchen building connects to the house on this facade. To the north of this point are a series of large timber-framed double-hung sash windows.|$|R
50|$|The west {{verandah}} is {{approached by}} a central set of timber stairs. The corners of the verandah have been enclosed to the north for toilets and to the south for a small kitchen. Both enclosed areas open to the verandah. There are four timber casement windows to {{the west in the}} south corner and three timber casements windows to the west in the north corner. The open middle portion of the verandah has a timber handrail and two horizontal midrails and a single stop chamfered verandah post {{at the top of the}} stair. The west verandah has exposed stud framing and is lined with <b>chamfer</b> <b>boards.</b> There are three sets of triple sash windows to the centre with timber doors to each side and an additional timber door near the north enclosure.

5000|$|The North Queensland Herald {{described}} the Hotel as a symmetrical two-storied structure {{on the main}} thoroughfare from the railway. On the ground floor there was a bar with four parlours, hall entrances from both streets, an office, billiard room and dining room. It was framed with hardwood and silky oak <b>chamfer</b> <b>boards</b> and beneath the bar there was an extensive cellar with street access. The first storey contained 11 double bedrooms and four single rooms. A large sitting room featured a discreet private sitting room for ladies at {{the eastern end of}} the balcony. Guest amenities were provided by the three upstairs bathrooms. French lights, ornamental bracket scroll louvres and coloured glass panels with ornamental margin lights featured {{at the end of each}} hall. The Hotel was lighted throughout by aerogen gas; a pressurised mixture of air and petrol vapour. This method was described as being a [...] "novel system" [...] of lighting in the west.|$|R
50|$|Minor {{alterations}} {{have been}} made to the St. David's Church over time. In 1888, a rainwater tank was installed {{on the south side of}} the church to keep water away from the foundations. The thrust of the shingle roof was causing the side walls to shore and in 1892 tie rods were introduced to reduce the outward thrust. In 1897, the exterior was sheathed in horizontal pine <b>chamfer</b> <b>boards</b> and painted, at a cost of £108. A memorial altar and altar rails were added to the church after World War One and the original altar and rails were then donated to St Andrew's Church at Glengallan. To celebrate the golden jubilee of the church in 1938, the shingled roof was replaced with diamond laid, fibrous cement tiles. This cladding was replaced in 1978 with corrugated metal sheeting and the church was painted at the same time. Sixteen stained glass windows - nine in the chancel, two in the lower western wall and five in the north wall - were installed in the early 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The 1890 {{section of}} the homestead, {{elevated}} on round timber posts, comprises five rooms of varying sizes all opening onto a wide verandah which surrounds the section. This section has a low pitched hipped roof clad with corrugated iron sheets, extending over the verandahs where it is lined with fibrous cement lining sheets with timber cover strips concealing edges. The verandah is supported on slender square planned posts which have partially chamfered corners {{and sit on the}} hand rail of the <b>chamfer</b> <b>board</b> cladded balustrade. Infilling some of the verandah openings are a series of early timber louvres. The building is constructed from wide, horizontal hardwood slabs housed in dressed vertical studs. Doors and windows in this section are housed frames between the studs. The windows are vertical sash with two sheets of glass per pane. The doors in this {{section of the}} building are four panelled with bolection mouldings on the horizontal edges of the panels and chamfered vertical edges. Above most of the doors but separated by two sections of timber slab, are operable transom windows, aligned with the ceiling line.|$|R
50|$|The Southport Drill Hall is a timber {{building}} {{situated on}} the southern side of Owen Park, Southport, {{among a number of}} other timber buildings. The building is of single skinned construction, timber framed and clad externally with <b>chamfered</b> <b>boards</b> and elevated on concrete stumps. The corrugated iron clad roof comprises a curved section over the main hall abutting a skillion roof over a row of offices. The curved section is supported on curved wrought iron trusses and the curved sections of the end walls have high level fixed louvre ventilation panels (now clad internally with sheeting) above with is vertical boarding. The northern face of the building houses the principal entrance through a large double timber boarded door. Flanking the door are two large double unglazed window openings which are protected with timber boarded shutters. Centrally located on the two ends of the building is a similar double window opening protected with timber shutters. The southern face of the building, where the offices are located, has four small vertical sash windows regularly spaced along the face of the building.|$|R
50|$|This {{central core}} is abutted {{on the north}} and south ends by added wings also with hipped roofs and with {{overhanging}} verandah awnings all clad with slate grey decromastic tiles. The verandahs of the wings have been infilled; the base of the infilled wall being formed by squared rubble sandstone walls, the sandstone for which was got from a stone cottage on the site. Above these walls are aluminium framed glazing. The wings are constructed from horizontal <b>chamfered</b> timber <b>boarding,</b> and several full length vertical sash windows and French doors open onto the verandah from the various internal rooms.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is almost square in plan, with verandahs on four sides, partially enclosed {{on the southern}} and western sides. The corrugated iron gabled roof is punctuated with three dormer windows each on the tapering northern and southern sides. The gable ends of the buildings feature narrow timber balconies, with hipped awnings, flanked by multi pane casement windows. Overhanging eaves and the decorative barge boards of the gables are supported on paired timber fretwork brackets. The single skinned external walls of the principal {{floor of the house}} are cross braced. Gable ends are clad with <b>chamfered</b> timber <b>boards,</b> and the underneath of the {{building is}} clad with tongue and grooved boarding.|$|R
50|$|The former {{residence}} at 50 Guy Street is a one storeyed timber building with simple rectangular plan and encircled by verandahs on three sides. The building, which is slightly elevated {{from the ground}} level on short timber posts, is timber framed and clad externally with horizontal <b>chamfered</b> timber <b>boards.</b> The hipped roof of the building is clad with sheets of corrugated iron. The verandahs, on the principal facade {{to the east and}} on the northern and southern facades of the building have a bull nose curved corrugated iron awning supported on paired timber columns with decorative cast iron brackets. The verandahs are lined with cast iron balustrading.|$|R
5000|$|This {{addition}} {{is built}} in the interwar [...] "Queensland Bungalow" [...] style. Rectangular in plan also, its ridge line runs {{at right angles to}} that of the late 19th century house. Again the roof shape is hipped but not at so steep a pitch. An open front verandah runs along the south- western elevation terminated by an enclosed room which runs the full width of the south-eastern elevation. A similar verandah runs along the north-western elevation but this verandah is enclosed with mesh fixed to a timber frame. Both verandahs have separate skillion roofs of galvanised corrugated iron along the full length of the long axis of this extension. A bay window extension fully fenestrated with casement windows is located centrally in the south-eastern elevation. Further sets of casement windows are set one on each side of this bay extension and are shaded by separate sunhoods. The external cladding to this house is <b>chamfer</b> <b>boards.</b> The stumps under are now concrete with decorative scalloped battened sections infilling between the perimeter stumps. Typical of this style of house, gardens are set {{around the perimeter of the}} house under the edge of the floor and are partially shaded from the worst of the heat of the sun by the decorative battening between the posts. The vines on the trellises of the colonial house merge with a dense cover of creeper along the north-eastern elevation of the extension. An elevated tank stand is positioned at the southern corner of this house, again with a garden underneath it.|$|R
50|$|During {{the time}} of their {{management}} extensive alterations were carried out on the residence. Local Warwick architects, Wallace and Gibson undertook extensions of the house in 1898-1899. The architects, a partnership of William Wallace and Richard Gibson, designed many buildings in and around Warwick including St George's Masonic Hall and the Barnes & Co department store in Palmerin Street. The extensions at Canning Downs comprised the addition of timber wings abutting either side of the principal residence. Both of which were rectangular planned with hipped corrugated iron roofs and discrete verandah awnings on the front and side elevations. The wings were timber framed and clad with <b>chamfered</b> horizontal <b>boarding,</b> with decorative timber features including cross-braced balustrading and fretwork column brackets.|$|R
50|$|The timber {{building}} comprises two intersecting barrel vaults, producing four identical round arched entrances at {{the ends}} of the vaults. Surmounting the point of intersection of the vaults is a tall fleche, {{in the form of a}} tower and dome, which doubles the full height of the building. The vaulted sections of the building are constructed with timber framed walls clad externally with horizontal <b>chamfered</b> timber <b>boards</b> and internally with diagonally laid tongue-and-groove boarding. The curved roofs of the vaults are formed with corrugated iron. The entrances, through the vaulted ends of these sections, have a wide carved timber fascia boards which rest visually on timber piers flanking the entrances. Internally the ceiling space is lined with regularly spaced timber trusses in the vaulted sections, and lined with timber boarding over the intersection.|$|R
5000|$|Kashiki uses various {{painting}} mediums including acrylic, pastel, color pencil, and others. In {{some recent}} works she has painted directly onto wooden panel. Since her graduate training, Kashiki began following a complex, ritualized process of her own. First sketched in pencil, her works are painted in acrylic, layer by layer onto a linen cloth mounted on large <b>Chamfered</b> wooden <b>boards.</b> Compositions are structured with overlapping, receding facets as she paints, sands and carves {{the surface of}} the panel, then repaints and pounces, layer over layer. This multi-step process has been seen as a physical articulation of Kashiki's own fleeting impressions - the [...] "flickering", fleeting landscapes of emotions and memories in her mind. In this way, Kashiki's paintings have been considered [...] "a manifestation of her inner landscape".|$|R
5000|$|The Isaac Goodale House {{is set on}} {{a remote}} lot {{at the end of}} a private lane that runs to the rear of Russell Orchards on the south side of Argilla Road. It is {{situated}} facing east toward salt marshes of a small tidal river. It is a 2-1/2 story timber framed structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. It has many surviving interior First Period elements, including <b>chamfered</b> beams and <b>board</b> and batten doors. The windows are reproductions; according to architectural historian Anne Grady, [...] "old leading and glass found in the cellar formed the model for the new leaded glass windows" [...] as part of a 1929 restoration.|$|R
