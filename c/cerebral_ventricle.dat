50|$|Ventriculostomy is a neurosurgical {{procedure}} that involves creating a hole ("stomy") within a <b>cerebral</b> <b>ventricle</b> for drainage. It {{is done by}} surgically penetrating the skull, dura mater, and brain such that the ventricle of the brain is accessed. When catheter drainage is temporary, it is {{commonly referred to as}} an external ventricular drain, or EVD. When catheter drainage is permanent, it is usually referred to as a shunt. There are many catheter-based ventricular shunts that are named for where they terminate, for example, a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt terminates in the peritoneal cavity, a ventriculoatrial shunt terminates within the atrium of the heart, etc. The most common entry point on the skull is called Kocher's point, which is measured 11 cm posterior to the nasion and 3 cm lateral to midline. EVD ventriculostomy is done primarily to monitor the intracranial pressure as well as to drain cerebrospinal fluid ("CSF"), primarily, or blood to relieve pressure from the central nervous system (CNS).|$|E

To achieve this, we was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease patients (PD-MCI group: 34 patients; Parkinson's disease with normal cognition, PD-NC group: 34 patients) to perform the SNSB test for the attention, language, memory, visuospatial, and frontal/executive functions and the brain MRI.

The experiments were carried out on rats under chloralose anesthesia.

After basal mean arterial pressure and heart rate recordings, the cardiopulmonary reflex was tested with a dose of phenylbiguanide (PBG, 8 &# 956;g/kg, bolus).

The ECoG effects were continuously analysed and quantified {{by means of a}} Berg-Fourier analyser as total power and as power in preselected bands of frequency. Clonidine (9. 4 to 75 nmol) given into the third <b>cerebral</b> <b>ventricle</b> produced behavioural sedation and sleep and a dose-dependent increase in ECoG total voltage power {{as well as in the}} lower frequency bands. Much lower doses were required to produce similar behavioural and ECoG spectrum power effects after either unilateral or bilateral microinfusion of clonidine into the locus coeruleus. Doses of clonidine equimolar to those given into the third <b>cerebral</b> <b>ventricle,</b> were almost ineffective in inducing behavioural and ECoG sleep after their microinfusion into the dorsal hippocampus. In addition, a dose (0. 56 nmol) of clonidine which, given into the locus coeruleus, produced marked behavioural sleep and ECoG synchronization, lacked effects when given into the ventral or anterior thalamus, into the amygdaloid complex or onto the frontal and sensimotor cortex. The behavioural and ECoG spectrum power effects of clonidine given into the third <b>cerebral</b> <b>ventricle</b> or into the locus coeruleus were prevented by antagonists of alpha 2 -adrenoceptors but not by alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonists. Intraventricular microinjection, or microinfusion into the locus coeruleus, of yohimbine, a selective alpha 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist, produced behavioural arousal, increase in locomotor and exploratory activity, tachypnoea and ECoG desynchronization with a significant reduction in total voltage power.

The study objectives were realized using the method allowing to record the amplitude of evoked tongue jerks (ETJ) in response to noxious tooth pulp stimulation during the perfusion of the <b>cerebral</b> <b>ventricles</b> with solutions containing tested compounds. Perfusion of the <b>cerebral</b> <b>ventricles</b> with GAL concentration-dependently inhibited the ETJ amplitude. The antinociceptive effect of GAL was blocked by a galanin receptor antagonist, galantide (GLT) and by opioid antagonists: non-selective naloxone (Nal) and μ-selective β-funaltrexamine (β-FNA). In contrast, a δ-opioid receptor antagonist, naltrindole (NTI) or the κ-opioid receptor antagonist, nor-binaltrophimine (nor-BNI) did not inhibit the effect of GAL.

Dose-response curves were obtained for intravenous or fourth cerebroventricular injections of ANG II, lysyl-vasopressin (LVP), bradykinin (BK), or endothelin- 1 (ET- 1). the ED 50 ratios for intracerebroventricular/intraveneous injections were 110 for ANG II, 109 for LVP, 0. 01 for BK, and approximately 0. 4 for ET- 1. in cross-circulation preparations, pressor responses occurred in the donor rat following injection into the fourth <b>cerebral</b> <b>ventricle</b> of the recipient animal, showing that effective doses of ANG II, administered to the fourth cerebral, reach the systemic circulation. the same results were obtained for the microinjection of 4 nmol of LVP into the fourth <b>cerebral</b> <b>ventricle</b> of recipient animals. High-performance reverse-phase liquid chromatography analyses of arterial blood showed that approximately 1 % of the [I- 125]ANG II injected into the fourth <b>cerebral</b> <b>ventricle</b> may be recovered from the systemic circulation a few seconds after the microinjection. the systemic administration of the ANG II receptor antagonist losartan blocked the response to ANG II injected into the fourth ventricle whereas antagonist administration in the same ventricle did not.
