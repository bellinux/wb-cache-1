25|$|The {{next step}} of {{gathering}} data surveys of over 12,500 expert contributors (lawyers, accountants etc.) in 190 countries {{who deal with}} business regulations in their day-to-day work. These individuals interact with the Doing Business team in conference calls, written correspondence and visits by the global team. For the 2017 report, team members visited 34 economies to verify data and to recruit respondents. Data from the survey is subjected to several rounds of verification. The surveys are not a statistical sample, {{and the results are}} interpreted and cross-checked for consistency before being included in the report. Results are also validated with the relevant government before publication. Respondents fill out written surveys and provide references to the relevant laws, regulations and fees, based on standardized <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> with specific assumptions, such as the business being located in the largest business city of the economy.|$|E
500|$|Rater {{intended}} {{the theme of}} the episode to be [...] "paranoia", elaborating: [...] "After Richard dropped the bomb that the hospital would be merging with Mercy West, we knew that this episode would have to deal with people's paranoia. Because merger means change. And change means fear. And the worst kind of fear is the kind that lives in your head. The dark thoughts. The paranoia. The worst <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> that you play out that usually don't come true. And with Richard holing himself up inside his office, it's just a breeding ground for rumor, fear and paranoia. So, when we started talking about this episode, the theme of paranoia emerged pretty quickly." [...] All storylines in the episode were inspired by Rater's friend base, including the story on schizophrenia. She offered her insight: ...|$|E
40|$|As it is {{possible}} for students of education universities who can enter into actual teaching practice from an early stage in their training, it may seem that {{there is no need to}} use the <b>case</b> <b>scenario.</b> In recent years, however, many serious problems have arisen with newly appointed teachers, as the actual school experience is too difficult for them to handle. They must therefore be trained through virtual experiences, using interactive cenarios. There in lies the necessity for increased virtual training. When creating an interactive <b>case</b> <b>scenario</b> of a problem that may occur in the educational field, it becomes especially difficult to assume a clear objective and to imagine the processes leading to the problem's resolution. It is required that we should follow up a clue to solve the problem viewing from various angles. In response to this problem, we propose an interactive <b>case</b> <b>scenario,</b> in lieu of a conventional <b>case</b> <b>scenario.</b> When using the interactive <b>case</b> <b>scenario,</b> learners can approach the essence of the event (where the problem is) through dialog with others. In such case, it is very important to display guiding questions, so as to clarify the functions and structures. We therefore elaborated an interactive <b>case</b> <b>scenario</b> and tried it many times. We here report the analytical results of those endeavors...|$|R
