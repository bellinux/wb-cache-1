50|$|Weedon, in {{collaboration}} with L. M. Jackman, {{was the first to}} use nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study the structures of carotenoids. He also worked on the synthesis of carotenoids and in 1953 described the synthesis of methylbixin which was produced by exposing bixin from Bixa orellana to iodine, later he successfully synthesised bixin using the Wittig reaction. During the 1960s and 1970s, Weedon's research group elucidated the structures of and synthesised a wide range of naturally occurring carotenoids. These included, canthaxanthin (responsible for the pink colour of flamingos), astaxanthin (responsible for the colour of lobsters), capsanthin and <b>capsorubin</b> (found in red peppers), renieratene (from Japanese sea sponges) and fucoxanthin (the most abundant carotenoid found in seaweed). Other compounds whose structures were discovered include alloxanthin, mytiloxanthin, decaprenoxanthin and violerythrin.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Capsicum species produce fruits that {{synthesize}} and accumulate carotenoid pigments, {{which are}} responsible for the fruits ’ yellow, orange and red colors. Chili peppers have been used as an experimental model for studying the biochemical and molecular aspects of carotenoid biosynthesis. Most reports refer to the characterization of carotenoids and content determination in chili pepper fruits from different species, cultivars, varieties or genotypes. The types and levels of carotenoids differ between different chili pepper fruits, and they are also influenced by environmental conditions. Yellow-orange colors of chili pepper fruits are mainly due to the accumulation of α- and β-carotene, zeaxanthin, lutein and β-cryptoxanthin. Carotenoids such as capsanthin, <b>capsorubin</b> and capsanthin- 5, 6 -epoxide confer the red colors. Chromoplasts are the sites of carotenoid pigment synthesis and storage. According to the most accepted theory, the synthesis of carotenoids in chili peppers is controlled by three loci: c 1, c 2 and y. Several enzymes participating in carotenoid biosynthesis in chili pepper fruits have been isolated and characterized, and the corresponding gene sequences have been reported.

40|$|Carotenoids {{can play}} {{multiple}} roles in biological photoreceptors {{thanks to their}} rich photophysics. In the present work, we have investigated six {{of the most common}} carbonyl containing carotenoids: echinenone, canthaxanthin, astaxanthin, fucoxanthin, capsanthin and <b>capsorubin.</b> Their excitation properties are investigated by means of a hybrid density functional theory (DFT) and multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) approach to elucidate the role of the carbonyl group: the bright transition is of Ï 8 ̆ 0 Ï 8 ̆ 0 â 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 7 character, as expected, but the presence of a CO moiety reduces the energy of nÏ 8 ̆ 0 â 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 7 transitions which may become closer to the Ï 8 ̆ 0 Ï 8 ̆ 0 â 8 ̆ 89 ̆ 7 transition, in particular as the conjugation chain decreases. This can be related to the presence of a low-lying charge transfer state typical of short carbonyl-containing carotenoids.

40|$|A {{study is}} {{conducted}} {{to optimize the}} supercritical fluid extraction of spice paprika oil (oleoresin) using supercritical (SF) CO 2 and subcritical propane as the solvents. The main focus is on carotenoid and tocopherol composition as the quality attributes of technological and nutritional interest. The maximum oil yield is 7. 2 and 8. 8 g per 100 g paprika with SF-CO 2 and subcritical propane, respectively. For the implementation of complete extraction at the given conditions, the ratio of solvent to solid {{is found to be}} 6. 0 and 1. 0 using SF-CO 2 and propane, respectively.

40|$|Tomato flowers (Solanum lycopersicum) {{were used}} as a model system to {{investigate}} flower color modification by alteration of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, due to their ease of transformation and short time from seed to flowering. Tomato flowers are naturally bright yellow, primarily due to the accumulation of violaxanthin. Violaxanthin is a precursor of capsanthin-capsorubin synthase (ccs), which catalyzes the conversion of antheraxanthin and violaxanthin, two yellow xanthophylls, into capsanthin and <b>capsorubin,</b> two red κ-xanthophylls, respectively. A capsanthin-capsorubin synthase gene cloned from tiger lily (Lilium lancifolium) was expressed in tomatoes {{under the control of}} the promoter from a petunia chalcone synthase gene, fused to an enhancer sequence of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter. All transgenic lines produced flowers with a light orange pigmentation, as opposed to the natural yellow coloration. UHPLC analysis confirmed that the color change coincided with the accumulation of two novel carotenoids, capsanthin and a capsanthin-like carotenoid. A more pronounced color change likely could have been achieved using a stronger promoter or by down-regulating competing pathways. Nevertheless, these results indicate that alteration of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway with a gene for capsanthin-capsorubin synthase is a possible strategy for producing novel red and orange hues in certain ornamental crops...|$|E

A study of methyl f 3 -apo carotenoates is consistant withthis result. Spectra of derivatives of 13 -carotene, such as zeaxanthin, isozeaxanthin, violaxanthin and alloxanthin, have been analysed. The stereochemistry of lutein is deduced from its spectrum to be trans between the 3 '-hydroxyl group and the polyene chain at C- 6 '. {{it is suggested that}} isomytiloxanthin has the alkyl groups at C- 5 and C- 6 of the cyclohexanone ring trans.

40|$|The {{pericarp}} of Capsicum {{fruit is}} a rich dietary source of carotenoids. Accumulation of these compounds may be controlled, in part, by gene transcription of biosynthetic enzymes. The carotenoid composition {{in a number of}} orange-coloured C. annuum cultivars was determined using HPLC and compared with transcript abundances for four carotenogenic enzymes, Psy, LcyB, CrtZ- 2, and Ccs determined by qRT-PCR. There were unique carotenoid profiles as well as distinct patterns of transcription of carotenogenic enzymes within the seven orange-coloured cultivars. In one cultivar, ‘Fogo’, carrying the mutant ccs- 3 allele, transcripts were detected for this gene, but no CCS protein accumulated. The premature stop termination in ccs- 3 prevented expression of the biosynthetic activity to synthesize the capsanthin and <b>capsorubin</b> forms of carotenoids. In two other orange-coloured cultivars, ‘Orange Grande ’ and ‘Oriole’, both with wild-type versions of all four carotenogenic enzymes, no transcripts for Ccs were detected and no red pigments accumulated.

Chillies are widely used as spice, condiment, culinary, supplement, medicine, vegetable and are ornamental plants too. It is an important food flavouring ingredient for flavouring many vegetarian and non-vegetarian food products. In view of its multifarious uses, the demand for chillies has been on the increase world over. In India it is an important cash crop, which is grown for the domestic market and for export.

40|$|The later {{steps of}} {{carotenoid}} biosynthesis involve {{the formation of}} cyclic carotenoids. The reaction is catalyzed by lycopene β-cyclase (LCY-B), which converts lycopene into β-carotene, and by capsanthin-capsorubin synthase (CCS), which is mainly dedicated to the synthesis of κ-cyclic carotenoids (capsanthin and <b>capsorubin)</b> but also has LCY-B activity. Although the peptide sequences of plant LCY-Bs and CCS contain a putative dinucleotide-binding motif, {{it is believed that}} these two carotenoid cyclases proceed via protic activation and stabilization of resulting carbocation intermediates. Using pepper (Capsicum annuum) CCS as a prototypic carotenoid cyclase, we show that the monomeric protein contains one noncovalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) that is essential for enzyme activity only in the presence of NADPH, which functions as the FAD reductant. The reaction proceeds without transfer of hydrogen from the dinucleotide cofactors to β-carotene or capsanthin. Using site-directed mutagenesis, amino acids potentially involved in the protic activation were identified. Substitutions of alanine, lysine, and arginine for glutamate- 295 in the conserved 293 -FLEET- 297 motif of pepper CCS or LCY-B abolish the formation of β-carotene and κ-cyclic carotenoids. We also found that mutations of the equivalent glutamate- 196 located in the 194 -LIEDT- 198 domain of structurally divergent bacterial LCY-B abolish the formation of β-carotene. The data herein reveal plant carotenoid cyclases to be novel enzymes that combine characteristics of non-metal-assisted terpene cyclases with those attributes typically found in flavoenzymes that catalyze reactions, with no net redox, such as type 2 isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase.

Evolution of microbial flora was followed to analyse their possible contribution, as an exogenous source, to enzymatic polygalacturonase (PG) activity. Our results indicated that the mild temperature–time regime mediated the selection and proliferation of a microbial flora that contributed to enzymatic PG activity modifying the pectic fraction. The enzymatic activity generated rises in the calcium pectate (CaP) fraction, which favoured the drying of fruit with an initial low content of soluble pectins (SP) and CaP. Thus, the changes in texture helped during the transfer of moisture, facilitating the dehydration process, and therefore, a milder temperature–time regime was required. Consequently, bioactive compounds of the fruit, such as <b>capsorubin,</b> capsanthin and provitamin A carotenoids, remained almost unaltered. On the other hand, when the SP fraction increased during dehydration, the process was delayed, and this was also correlated with a higher content in SP and CaP in fresh fruit, indicating that the fruits were harvested at a later stage of ripeness. In this case a more intense temperature–time regime was needed, negatively affecting the carotenoid content by decreasing it significantly.

40|$|Changes in the {{biosynthesis}} {{of individual}} carotenoid pigments {{have been investigated}} during fruit ripening of five cultivars of red pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) : Mana, Numex, Belrubi, Delfin, and Negral (a chlorophyll-retaining mutant when ripe). The study was carried out throughout the ripening process, and with special emphasis on the ripe stage, to discover possible differences between cultivars and to characterize these by their carotenoid pattern and content for selecting the best varieties for breeding programs. Ripening fruit of the five cultivars showed the typical and characteristic pattern of carotenoid biosynthesis for the Capsicum genus. In the five cultivars, lutein and neoxanthin, both characteristic chloroplast pigments, decreased in concentration with ripening and eventually disappeared. â-Carotene, antheraxanthin, and violaxanthin increased in concentration, and other pigments were biosynthesized de novo: zeaxanthin, â-cryptoxanthin, capsanthin, <b>capsorubin,</b> capsanthin- 5, 6 -epoxide, and cucurbitaxanthin A. A pool of zeaxanthin stands out {{of the rest of}} pigment during ripening, which reveals the importance of this pigment as a branching point in the carotenoid biosynthesis in Capsicum. Quantitatively, Negral cultivar showed the highest increase in total carotenoid content (48. 39 -fold), followed by Mana and Delfin with 38. 03 - and 36. 8 - fold, respectively, and by Belrubi and Numex with 28. 03 - and 23. 48 -fold, respectively. In all the red varieties, there was an inverse relationship between total carotenoid content and the red to yellow isochromic pigment fraction ratio (R/Y) and the capsanthin-to-zeaxanthin ratio (Caps/Zeax). This seems {{to be related to the}} carotenogenic capacity of the cultivar, and thus selection and breeding should not only seek a higher total carotenoid content but also attempt to increase these ratios. In the present study, the cultivar Mana had the highest total carotenoid content (13 208 mg/kg dwt), but the lowest R/Y (1. 25) and Caps/Zeax (3. 38) ratios, which are therefore the parameters to improve. The cultivar Negral had a high carotenoid content (8797 mg/kg dwt) and high R/Y and Caps/Zeax ratios and could be used for transfer of these characters in direct crosses with the cultivar Mana.

Among 14 amino acids, the extracts of Thr/monosaccharide/creatinine model system shows the highest mutagenicity examined with S. typhimurium TA 98 {{in the presence of}} S 9 mix. Five major mutagenic IQ compounds in the extracts of Thr/Rib/creatinine model system were purified through 3 HPLC columns and the mutagenicity of 1 -min fraction eluted from each HPLC purified step was monitores with TA 98 strains. Three mutagenic fraction corresponding to the peaks of the standard mutagens IQx, MeIQx, and 4, 8 -DiMeIQx were confirmed by the comparison of UV and mass spectra. To clarify which MRPs involved the formation of IQ in three model systems, MRPs in dichloromethane extracts of Thr/monosaccharide/creatinine model systems were determined by GC-MS. The pyrazines in the extracts of three model sy stems have the greatest amounts among 8 kinds of MRPs. Moreover, the production amounts of pyrazines in three model systems correlated well with their mutagenicity and IQ mutagen contents. In addition, four pyrazines separately added into the three model systems to study the effects of pyrazines on the mutagenicity. The result showed that 2 -methylpyrazine and 2, 3 -dimethylpyrazine were important for the mutagenicity production than 2, 6 -dimethylpyrazine and trimethylpyrazine. Therefore, we proposed that 2 -methylpyrazine and 2, 3 -dimethylpyrazine might participated in imidazoquinoxaline-type mutagen formation in Thr/monosaccharide/creatinine model systems. Part II In order to elucidate the role of MRPs on the IQ-type mutagen formation, the mutagenicity of extracts of eight kinds of MRPs including forteen MRPs/ acetylformaldehyde/creatinine model systems were examined with Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 in the presence of S 9 mix. After nitrite treatment experiment, data showing three kinds of MRPs, pyrazines,pyridines, and thiazoles in model systems contributed to the IQ-type mutagen formation were important than other kinds of MRPs. In addition, p yrazines were produced in acetylformaldehyde/creatinine and acetylformaldehyde/thiazole model systems which were comfirmed by mass spectrometry. We therefore suggested that pyrazines may play an important role on the IQ-type mutagen formation. Furtherly, the IQ-type mutagens were purified from different four kinds of pyrazines/ acetylformaldehyde/creatinine model systems by a seris of HPLC column. Five major mutagen compounds were found to be IQx, MeIQx, 7, 8 -DiMeIQx, IQ, and MeIQ. Among these formers were identified by mass spectrometry. From the IQ-type mutagen yielded, we suggested that 2 -methylpyrazine, 2, 3 -dimethylpyrazine 2, 6 -dimethylpyrazine, and trimethylpyrazine were important for the IQx, MeIQx, and 7, 8 -DiMeIQx rpoduction, respectively. Part III Three heterocyclic aromatic amines, 2 -amino- 3 -methylimidazo[4, 5 -f] quinoline(IQ), 2 -amino- 3, 4 -dimethylimidazo[4, 5 -f] quinoline(MeIQ), 2 -amino- 3 -methylimidazo[4, 5 -f] quinoxaline(MeIQx) have been found in boiled pork juice. We have investigated the effect of naturally occurring organosulfur compounds, which are present in garlic and onion, on the mutagen formation in boiled pork juice. Six organosulfur compounds were added separately to the pork juice before reflux boiling and then the mutagenicity of each sample was examined with Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 in the presence of S 9 mix. All of six organosulfur compounds including diallyl disulfide(DADS), diallyl sulfide(DAS), dipropyl disulfide (DPDS), dipropyl sulfide(DPS), allyl methyl sulfide(AMS) and allyl mercaptan(AM) inhibited the mutagenicity of boiled pork juice. The greastest inhibitory effect was observed with DADS and DPDS and this was 111 -fold higher than that of the lowest cysteine. To elucidate the inhibitory effect of DADS on mutagen formation in boiled pork juice, the major mutagenic fraction were monitored after HPLC separation by their mutagenicity with S. typhimurium TA 98. By comparison of the retention time of authentic IQ compounds from boiled pork juice with those following the addition of DADS, we showed that the mutagenicity of three major fraction was significantly inhibited compared to those same fraction in boiled pork juice alone. Moreover, the Maillard reaction products(MRPs) in the boiled pork juice with and without the addition of DADS were quantified and identified by capillary gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results show that the reduction in the total amounts of MRPs(pyridines,pyrazines, thiophenes, and thiazoles) in boiled pork juice after boiling 12 hr was correlated with their mutagenicity. Among the MRPs, tetrahydrothiophene- 3 -one(THT) exhibited the strongest correlation. These data suggest that the inhibition of IQ mutagen formation by DADS is mediated through the reduction of MRPs production. Furthermore, 7 pyrazines were separately added into th boiled pork juice to study the influence on the mutagenicity of BPE. The greastest enhancement was observed with the addion of 2, 3 -dimethylpyrazine in the boiled pork juice model systems. On the other hands, we studied the inhibitory effects of addition of BHA and flavone on the mutagenicity and IQ-mutagen formation of glucose/ glycine/creatinine model system. The reduction capability of flavone on the mutagenicity and IQ-mutagen formation in the model system was higher than that of BHA. To elucidate the mechanism, the correlation between the changed amounts of MRPs in the model system during heating periods and their mutagenicity was also investigated. Except 2, 3 -dimethylpyrazine in the model system with the addition of BHA, significant correlation was observed between the amounts of each of five pyrazines produced in both model system. (with the addition of BHA and flavone) and the mutagenicity. These suggest that 2, 3 -dimethylpyrazine might play an important role on the formation of imidazoquinoxaline in boiled pork juice and glucose/glycine/creatinine model system. Part IV The antimutagenicity of dichloromethane extracts from eight amino acid/monosarrcharide model systems was determined using Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 against 2 - amino - 3 - methyl imidazo[4, 5 -f]quinoline (IQ) in the presence of Aroclor 1254 -induced rat hepatic S 9. The Maillard reaction products(MRPs) in the dichloromethane extracts were then quantified and qualified by capillary gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry，respectively‧ Pyrazines and furans were found to be the major MRPs yielded in the extracts. Furans showed the antimutagenicity in several investigator reports. Moreover, the antimutagenicity of dichloromethane extracts correlated positively with the total amounts of pyrazines (r= 0. 762, P< 0. 01). Thus we concluded that pyrazines in dichloromethane extracts from eight amino acid/monosarrcharide model systems {{play an important role in}} the antimutagenicity of IQ. To elucidate the mechanism of dichloromethane extracts, the inhibitory effect of pyrazines on ethoxylcoumarin deethylase activity in aroclor 1254 -induced hepatic microsomes was examined. We also studied the effects of pyrazines on IQ metabolism by Aroclor 1254 -induced microsomes using high-performance liquid chromatography. The antimutagenicity of pyrazines correlated positively with the inhibition of cytochrome P- 450 IA 2 -linked ethoxylcoumarin deethylase in hepatic microsomes and the inhibition of N-hydroxy-IQ formation from IQ metabolism by hepatic microsomes. Moreover, we concluded that the modifying effect of pyrazines on the mutagenicity of IQ is mediated through interaction with microsomal activating enzymes to inhibit the major active metbolite in N-hydroxy-IQ formation. Part V The inhibitory effects of chili (Capsicum annum L.) oleoresins extracted with eight solvents on the mutagenicity of IQ were examined with Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 with the presence of S 9 mix. The highest antimutagenicity was observed on n-hexane oleoresin followed by diether ether, dichloromethane, acetone, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol and water olepresins in decreasing order. To determine the major antimutagenic compound in chili oleoresin, carotenoids in n-hexane oleoresin were purifie d and analyzed by TLC and HPLC. The result showed that ten carotenoids were isolated and identified such as β-carotene,β-cryptoxanthin, cryptocapsin, zeaxanthin, capsolutin, cis-capsanthin, alteraxanthin, capsanthin, violaxanthin, <b>capsorubin.</b> The remaining four unknown compounds presented in n-hexane oleoresin need further investigation. Interestingly, the antimutagenicity of egiht chili oleoresins correlated positively with their total amounts of carotenoids(r= 0. 85,P< 0. 01). To elucidate the mechanism of antimutagenicity of chili oleoresins, the inhibitory effect of carotenoids on ECD activity in Aroclor 1254 -induced hepatic microsomes was examined. We also studied the effects of carotenoids on the direct mutagenicity of N-hydroxy-IQ using TA 98 strains. Thus we concluded that carotenoids in chili oleoresins may play an important role in the antimutagenicity of IQ. Moreover, the modifying effects of carotenoids on the mutagenicity of IQ is mediated through direct interaction with N-hydroxy-IQ, but not by alter the metabolic activation of IQ. Part VI Cryptocapsin is one of naturally occurring oxgenated carotenoids in chili fruit. The effect of cryptocapsin on the formation of DNA adducts of N-hydroxyamino- 3 -methylimidazo[4, 5 -f]quinoline(N-OH-IQ), in Sprague Dawley rat liver primary cultured cells was examined by 32 P-postlabeling assay. The N-OH-IQ-DNA adducts formed in rat primary hepatocytes was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by cryptocapsin. The interaction between cryptocapsin and N-OH-IQ was monitored by UV spectroscopic study to ascertain the mechanism. The absorption maxinum shifts toward longer wavelength resulted from the interaction between cryptocapsin and N-OH-IQ. Furthermore, the N-OH-IQ-cryptocapsin adducts has been identified by mass spectrometry. These results indicate that cryptocapsin inhibited the mutagenicity and DNA adduct of N-OH-IQ was mediated through the formation of a novel molecule. The mechanism of action against the mutagenicity of N-OH-IQ is discussed. 封面 目錄 第一章 文獻綜論 第二章 以胺基酸/單醣/肌酸酐模式系探討形成IQ型致突變物之可能前驅物 2. 1 中文摘要 2. 2 前言 2. 3 材料與方法 2. 3. 1 實驗流程 2. 3. 2 材料藥品 2. 3. 3 毒性試驗與代謝活化系統製備 2. 3. 4 胺基酸/單醣/肌酸酐模式系中MRPs之分析 2. 3. 5 胺基酸/單醣/肌酸酐模式戲中IQ型致突變物之萃取、純化與鑑定 2. 3. 6 添加各種pyrazines於胺基酸/單醣/肌酸酐模式系中探討其對IQ型致突變物形成之影響 2. 3. 7 致突變性之測定 2. 3. 8 數據統計分析 2. 4 結果 2. 4. l各胺基酸/單醣/肌酸酐模式系鹼層萃取物之致突變性 2. 4. 2 各模式系所形成之MRPS之鑑定與定量 2. 4. 3 添加各種pyrazines於Thr/單醣/肌酸酐模式系中對致突變物形成之影響 2. 4. 4 各模式系所形成之lQ型致突變物之鑑定與定量 2. 5 討論 2. 6 圖與表 2. 7 英文摘要 第三章 以梅納反應產物/醛類/肌酸酐模式系探討IQ型致突變物之形成路徑 3. 1 中文摘要 3. 2 前言 3. 3 材料與方法 3. 3. 1 實驗流程 3. 3. 2 藥品與材料 3. 3. 3 毒性試驗與代謝活化系統製備 3. 3. 4 MRPs/醛類/肌 酸酐模式系之建立 3. 3. 5 各模式系所形成之致突燮物之萃取、純化與鑑定 3. 3. 6 致突變性的測定 3. 3. 7 統計分析 3. 4 結果 3. 4. 1 MRPs種類在模式系中對IQ型致突變物形成之影響 3. 4. 2 Thiazoles於模式系中形成IQ型致突變物之角色 3. 4. 3 肌酸酐於模式系中形成IQ型致突變物之角色 3. 5 討論 3. 6 圖與表 3. 7 英文摘要 第四章 蔥屬植物含硫化合物在豬肉汁模式系與抗氧化劑在甘胺酸/葡萄糖/肌酸酐模式系中影響IQ型致突變物形成之研究 4. 1 中文摘要 4. 2 前 言 4. 3 材料與方法 4. 3. 1 實驗流程 4. 3. 2 藥品與料料 4. 3. 3 毒性試驗與代謝活化系統製備 4. 3. 4 豬肉汁模式系之建立 4. 3. 5 甘胺酸/葡萄糖/肌酸酐模式系之建立 4. 3. 6 豬肉汁與甘胺酸/葡萄糖/肌酸酐模式系之褐變程度測定 4. 3. 7 豬肉汁與甘胺酸/葡萄糖/肌酸酐模式系中梅納反應產物之鑑定與定量 4. 3. 8 豬肉汁與甘胺酸/葡萄糖/肌酸酐模式系中致突變物之萃取,純化和鑑定 4. 3. 9 致突變性之測定 4. 4. 10 蔥屬植物含硫化合物還原能力 第五章 胺基酸/單糖模式系梅納反應產物對IQ之抗突變性 :比阱(pyrazineS) 之角色 5. 1 摘要 5. 2 前言 5. 3 材料與方法 5. 3. 1 實驗流程與藥品 5. 3. 2 胺基酸/單醣/基酸酐模式系建立及樣品之萃取 5. 3. 3 樣品以氣相層析並配合質譜儀鑑定 5. 3. 4 毒氣試驗與代謝活化系統製備 5. 3. 5 致突變性與抗致突變性之測定 5. 3. 6 去致突變性與生物抗致突變性之測定 5. 3. 7 Pyrazines對肝臟微粒體酵素系統活化IQ之影響 5. 3. 8 Pyrazines對ethoxycoumarin deethyase(ECD) 活性之影響 5. 3. 9 Pyrazincs對鼠肝微粒體活化lQ之影響 5. 3. 10 統計分析 5. 4 結果 5. 4. 1 胺基酸/單醣模式系反應液與二氮甲烷萃取物對IQ之抗突變性 5. 4. 2 Pyrazines對 1 Q抗突變機制之初步分析 5. 4. 3 Pyrazines對鼠肝微粒體活化IQ之影響 5. 5 討論 5. 6 圖與表 5. 7 英文摘要 第六章 辣椒抗突變性成分之研究 6. 1 中文摘要 6. 2 前言 6. 3 材料與方法 6. 3. 1 材料與藥品 6. 3. 2 試驗材料之製備與實驗流程 6. 3. 3 辣椒中類胡蘿蔔素之萃取、純化與鑑定 6. 3. 4 毒性測試與代謝活化系統之製備 6. 3. 5 致突變性試驗方法及步驟 6. 3. 6 抗突變性試驗方法及步驟 6. 3. 7 辣椒精油樹脂及其類胡蘿蔔素對肝臟S 9 -mix活化IQ之影響 6. 3. 8 辣椒精油樹脂及其類胡蘿蔔素對IQ及其活化物作用之試驗方法及步驟 6. 3. 9 ECD酵素活性之測定 6. 3. 10 N- 0 H-IQ之化學合成 6. 3. 11 辣椒精油樹脂與類胡蘿蔔素對N- 0 H-IQ之抗突變性分析 6. 3. 12 統計分析 6. 4 結果 6. 4. 1 辣椒精油樹脂之抗致突變性 6. 4. 2 正己烷萃取之辣椒精油樹脂之主要化學成分 6. 4. 3 辣椒精油樹脂及其類胡蘿蔔素對 1 Q抗突變性之可能機制 6. 4. 4 辣椒精油樹脂及其類胡蘿蔔素對肝臟微粒體酵素代謝活化 1 Q之影響 6. 4. 5 辣椒類胡蘿蔔素對N- 0 H-IQ之抗突變性 氧化性 6. 5 討論 6. 6 圖與表 6. 7 英文摘要 第七章 辣椒類胡蘿蔔素-Cryptocasin對IQ抗突變機制之研究 7. 1 摘要 7. 2 前言 7. 3 材料方法 7. 3. 1 材料與藥品 7. 3. 2 毒性試驗與代謝活化系統之製備 7. 3. 3 N- 0 H-IQ之化學合成 7. 3. 4 以紫外線光譜儀分析N- 0 H-IQ與cryptocapsin之作用 7. 3. 5 以質譜儀鑑定N- 0 H-IQ與cryptocapsin之鍵結物 7. 3. 6 類胡蘿葡素對N- 0 H-IQ-DNA鍵結物形成之影響 7. 3. 7 Cryptocapsin於初代鼠肝細胞中對IQ遺傳毒性之影響 7. 3. 8 數據之統計分析 7. 4 結果 7. 4. 1 類胡蘿蔔素對N- 0 H-IQ-DNA鍵結物形成之影響 7. 4. 2 Cryptocapsin與IQ之細胞毒性 7. 4. 3 Cryptocapsin在初代鼠肝細胞中對IQ-DNA鍵結物形成之影響 7. 4. 4 Cryptocapsin與N- 0 H-IQ之作用 7. 5 討論 7. 6 圖與表 7. 7 英文摘要 參考文...|$|E
