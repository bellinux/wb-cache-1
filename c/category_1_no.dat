30|$|Akita et al. (Akita et al. 2009) {{reported}} that no malignancy {{was found in}} <b>category</b> <b>1</b> (<b>no</b> abnormal enhancement in both breasts) and category 2 (bilateral symmetrical enhancement), which {{may have contributed to}} the high specificity (100 %) in their study. However, there was one false-negative case belonging to category 2 in our study. DCIS sometimes shows indistinct enhancement on MR imaging because of relatively poor or absent angiogenesis (Ghai et al. 2005). Moreover, the one false-negative lesion (high-grade DCIS) was less than 1.0  mm in size and thus were very small. Therefore, it should be remembered that very small calcified lesions (less than 1.0  mm) may be false negative on MR imaging.|$|E
40|$|Background—Hospitalized {{patients}} with heart failure {{are at risk}} for cardiac arrest. The ability to predict who may survive such an event with or without neurological deficit would enhance the information on which patients and providers establish resuscitative preferences. Methods and Results—We identified 13 063 adult {{patients with}} acute heart failure who had cardiac arrest at 457 hospitals participating in the National Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2007. Neurological status was determined on admission and discharge by cerebral performance category with neurologically intact survival (NIS) cerebral performance <b>category</b> <b>1</b> (<b>no)</b> or 2 (moderate dysfunction) and non-NIScerebral performance category 3 (severe dysfunction), 4 (coma), or 5 (brain death). Factors available prearrest (demographics, preexisting conditions, and interventions in-place) were assessed for association with NIS using multivariable logistic regression, initially without then with adjustment for arrest-related variables and hospital characteristics. NIS occurred in 2307 patients (17. 7 %) and was associated by adjusted odds ratio with 18 prearrest factors; 4 positively and 14 negatively. The association (odds ratio; 95 % CI) was strongest for 4 specific variables: acute stroke (0. 38; 0. 25 to 0. 58), history of malignancy (0. 49; 0. 39 to 0. 63), vasopressor use (0. 50; 0. 43 to 0. 59), and assisted or mechanical ventilation (0. 53; 0. 45 to 0. 61). Conclusions—A number of prearrest factors seem to be associated with NIS, the majority inversely. Consideration of these before cardiac arrest could enhance the resuscitative decision-making process for patients with acute heart failure. (Cir...|$|E

Yet globally, palliative care development appears patchy and comparative data about the distribution of services are generally unavailable. Our purpose is to categorize hospice-palliative care development, country by country, throughout the world, and then depict this development in a series of world and regional maps.

MethodsDeaths and person-years of follow-up were stratified in a time-dependent fashion into <b>categories</b> of (<b>1)</b> <b>no</b> proteinuria and normal serum creatinine (SCr); (2) proteinuria and normal SCr; (3) high SCr [SCr ≥ 133 μmol/L (1. 5 mg/dL) in men, ≥ 124 μmol/L (1. 4 mg/dL) in women] but not on renal replacement therapy (RRT); or (4) RRT. ResultsAmong 1993 subjects, 55. 8 % had type 2 diabetes at baseline. Overall death rates increased with declining kidney function in both the nondiabetic and diabetic subjects (P < 0. 0001). Death rates were similar in nondiabetic and diabetic subjects with comparable levels of kidney function, {{although the number of}} deaths among nondiabetic subjects with advanced KD was small. Infections and malignancy were the leading causes of death in nondiabetic subjects with KD. Among diabetic subjects, overall mortality increased with diabetes duration (P = 0. 0001) and was highest in those on RRT (P < 0. 0001). High SCr was associated with higher death rates from cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetic nephropathy (DN), infections, and malignancy. ConclusionDeath rates increased comparably with worsening kidney function in both nondiabetic and diabetic subjects and were similar in nondiabetic and diabetic subjects without KD.

40|$|AbstractObjective: The aims of {{this study}} were as follows: (1) to {{evaluate}} Doppler ultrasonography in assessing hand collateral circulation; (2) to define the criteria for an abnormal Doppler ultrasonography dynamic test result; and (3) to validate the modified Allen test. Methods: The hand circulation of 71 patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting was assessed by means of the Allen test and Doppler ultrasonography. The flow in the superficial palmar branch of the radial artery, the ulnar artery, and the dorsal digital thumb artery with and without radial artery compression were recorded. Flow patterns in the superficial palmar branch of the radial artery, the ulnar artery, and the dorsal digital thumb artery with radial artery compression were categorized into 4 groups: (<b>1)</b> <b>no</b> flow; (2) decreased flow; (3) reversed flow; and (4) increased flow. Results: Among the 71 hands, 4 (5. 6 %) had an abnormal Allen test result (> 10 seconds). Seven (10. 6 %) of 66 superficial palmar branches of the radial artery, 3 (4. 2 %) of 71 ulnar arteries, and 2 (2. 8 %) of 71 dorsal digital thumb arteries showed no flow with radial artery compression, as measured by Doppler ultrasonography. There were significant differences among the 4 groups (superficial palmar branch of the radial artery: F = 7. 0, P <. 001; ulnar artery: F = 13. 1, P <. 001; and dorsal digital thumb artery: F = 8. 4, P <. 001) for the Allen test. Pairwise comparisons showed that when subjected to an Allen test, <b>category</b> <b>1</b> patients (<b>no</b> flow) had significantly longer recovery times compared with the other groups (P <. 02 in all cases) for the superficial palmar branch of the radial artery, the ulnar artery, and the dorsal digital thumb artery. Conclusion: Absence of flow in the dorsal digital thumb artery with radial artery compression is considered an absolute contraindication to radial artery harvesting. An increased recovery time with the modified Allen test predicts absence of flow in the dorsal digital thumb artery in Doppler ultrasonographic flow patterns. This demonstrates the validity of the modified Allen test for primary screening. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2001; 121 : 526 - 31...|$|R

The availability of cerebral protection systems has expanded the area of application of this procedure. Objective: To assess the feasibility, safety, and immediate and late clinical outcome in patients under-going percutaneous carotid interventions. Methods: Between January 1999 and December 2000, 100 consecutive patients with 102 carotid artery stenoses were treated (71 men, 29 women, mean (SD) age 67 (8) years) : 49 had coronary artery disease, 28 had previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). On the basis of the Mayo Clinic carotid endarterectomy risk scale, 73 patients were grade III–IV and 13 grade VI. Results: Baseline diameter stenosis was 78. 8 (10) %, with a mean lesion length of 12. 6 (5. 8) mm. Angiographic success was obtained in 99 lesions (97. 0 %) with a final diameter stenosis of 2. 4 (3. 5) %. Procedural success was obtained in 96 patients (96 %). Selective cannulation of three carotid arteries was impossible owing to severe vessel tortuosity.
