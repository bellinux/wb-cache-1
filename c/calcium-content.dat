40|$|Previously, we {{observed}} the inhibitory effect of phosphorylated oligosaccharides (PO) from potato-starch on {{the formation of}} calcium phosphate precipitate. PO were composed of PO- 1 fraction and PO- 2 fraction. The former was maltooligosaccharide bound to one phosphate molecule, the latter was maltooligosaccharide bound to at least more than two phosphate molecules. PO- 2 had the stronger inhibitory effect. In the present study, we investigated the effect of PO- 2 feeding on calcium utilization in rats. Five-week-old rats were fed calcium diet (0. 52 % of calcium) containing 5 % PO- 2 for two weeks. Apparent calcium absorption ratio and apparent retention ratio during periods (day 3 ～ 6, day 10 ～ 14) were significantly lower in rats fed the PO- 2 diet than in the control diet. Results of the test on breaking-force and <b>calcium-content</b> of the femurs were not different between two groups. Whole cecal weight was significantly elevated in rats fed the PO- 2 diet and the amounts of short chain fatty acid in the cecum content were significantly increased. Cecal pH was not changed. We could not observed {{the relationship of the}} stronger inhibitory effect of phosphorylated oligosaccharide PO- 2 to utilization of calcium...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background TPN infusions {{are usually}} {{administered}} during a treatment period of 10 – 24 {{hours per day}} due to the metabolic capacity of the liver. During this time interval physicochemically stable TPN solution (emulsion) is needed for the treatment. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine how the kinetic stability features of ready-made total parenteral nutrition admixtures containing olive oil and soybean oil will change under the usage-modeling 24 -hour application with and without overdose Ca 2 +. Methods Particle size analysis and zeta potential measurements were carried out to evaluate the possible changes in the kinetic stability of the emulsions. Results Our results indicate that in two of the four mixtures bimodal droplet-size distribution figures were detected and appearance of fat particles over 5 [*]μm can not be disclosed. The tendency for separation of large diameter droplets in the two types of oil-based emulsion systems was different. In case of soybean containing emulsion second peak of droplets appeared in the bottom of the container in contrast to the olive oil containing emulsions where the second peak appeared in the surface layer. Interestingly this phenomenon is independent of <b>calcium-content.</b> Conclusions From therapeutic point the emulsions of the bigger droplets containing upper layer are safer because the potentially dangerous big droplets could remain in the infusion bag after the administration. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aims Our {{objective}} was to analyze the calcium absorption and distribution characteristics of pteridophyte species, and to determine their adaptation to high calcium. Methods Eleven pteridophytes were collected from Maolan National Nature Reserve and the surrounding area. We analyzed their calcium absorption and distribution behavior by comparing the calcium content in each organ and the rhizosphere. Important findings In acidic soil, calcium availability in the rhizosphere of Nephrolepis auriculata was much {{higher than that of}} other species. Because of low calcium content in acidic soil, the calcium content of calcifuge was significantly lower than that of exclusive calciphytes. Except for N. auriculata and Parathelypteris glanduligera, the calcium content in various organs of plants that lived in acidic soil were mature leaf > roots > young leaf, and the calcium content in various organs of plants that lived in calcareous soil were roots > mature leaf > young leaf. In addition, calcium content in various organs of Pteris cretica var. nervosa had differences between calcareous and acidic soils. Calcium content of exclusive calciphytes had significant interspecific differences. Results suggested that N. auriculata could meet its calcium needs by enriching and activating calcium in the rhizosphere. The calcium content in plants could be reflected by the calcium supply in the soil. In different soils, the <b>calcium-content</b> differences in various organs might be related to their adaptive behavior towards changes ofsoil calcium content. The demands for calcium of the five exclusive calciphytes species were disparate. When they encountered high calcium stress, their primary adaptation behaviors differed. Cyrtogonellum fraxinellum, Cyrtomium fortune and Pteris vittata had calciphilious features, but Adiantum capillus-veneris was a low calcium species...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} nitrogen concentrations in a submerge medium {{to the development}} of biofilms have been evaluated. Nitrogen was added in eight several concentrations. The inoculation was done with a natural mix population. A special biofilm-reactor arrangement and a synthetic medium has been developed to create the biofilms reproducible. Multiple parameters were monitored to characterize changes in bacterial biofilm (water- oxygen- hydrogen- nitrogen- carbon- carbohydrate- protein- colonized forming units (cfu) - calcium- phosphate- matters) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The results showed increased significance of different nitrogen availableness in synthetic media to the composition of produced biofilms and EPS. The water- nitrogen- carbohydrate- protein- cfu- and <b>calcium-contents</b> in biofilms are depended from the available nitrogen. The contents of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon and phosphate are not influenced by the available nitrogen...|$|R
