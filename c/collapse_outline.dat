The seismic collapse capacity of SDOF systems is evaluated via an incremental dynamic analysis, based on which the collapse capacity spectrum is developed. The computational procedure and engineering significance of the collapse capacity spectrum are elaborated in some detail.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to critically evaluate the clinical results of emerging aortic endovascular therapies and then to utilize dynamic imaging modalities [EKG gated dynamic computerized tomographic angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) ] to understand the limitations of these technologies and potential source of any complications. The first published mid-term results of aneurysm repair with fenestrated and branched endografts from a European center of excellence is described in Chapter 2. The use of fenestrated and branched devices for difficult re-operative aortic surgery as a salvage procedure was examined in Chapter 3. These two clinical trials revealed new complications specific to fenestrated and branched devices. For example, fractured or bent side-branches and occluded renal branch vessels were observed. The potential of repeated dynamic stresses related to the cardiac cycle was postulated {{as a source of}} the problems. The dynamic effect of placing a relatively stiff endograft into a compliant, pulsatile aorta was examined in Chapter 4 through EKG-gated cine CTA. The cardiac based dynamics of the aorta was confirmed in a separate cohort of patients in Chapter 5 using the different modality of EKG-gated cine MRA. Furthermore, stent-graft design specific differences in compliance of the aorta and endograft were noted following EVAR. The renal arteries are the most commonly preserved aortic branch vessels using a fenestrated or branched technique. Furthermore, the complications identified in the fenestrated and branched clinical papers were typically related to the renal arteries. Therefore, we focused our attention on the effects of EVAR on renal artery motion in Chapter 6. Based on earlier work noting differences in stent-graft design on aortic dynamics, we evaluated the effect of three stent-graft designs (infra-re-nal fixation, supra-renal fixation, and branched) on renal artery motion in Chapter 7. Clinicians are increasingly placing thoracic endografts for 'off-label' indications such as traumatic aortic rupture in an effort to provide a less invasive and more effective treatment for these seriously injured poly-trauma patients. Chapter 8 is a systematic analysis of anatomic factors which may predict the rare, potentially devastating complication of thoracic endoprosthesis collapse. Based in part on dynamic CT imaging of thoracic endoprosthesis <b>collapse</b> <b>outlined</b> in Chapter 8, an examination of normal descending aortic pulsatility was undertaken. The results are presented in Chapter 9 and provide insight into the local environment into which these thoracic stent-grafts are being placed.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{progenitor}} evolution of high mass black hole binaries with black hole of mass ∼> 10 M⊙, like Cyg X- 1. From the observed large space velocity of Cyg X- 1, which we interpret as {{coming from a}} Blaauw-Boersma kick, {{we find that the}} helium envelope of the black hole progenitor must have been at least 16 M⊙. Using new and improved wind mass loss rates for Wolf-Rayet stars, we are unable to evolve such massive helium envelopes unless the black hole progenitor evolves through a substantial hydrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet (WNL) phase. Such evolution, which has been proposed by Langer (1987) for the most massive stars, keeps the helium core covered by hydrogen during most of the post-main sequence evolution, with the effect that it grows in mass instead of suffering extensive mass loss as hydrogen-free Wolf-Rayet star. We then discuss the important role of convective carbon burning, and its dependence on the C/O ratio resulting from core helium burning, for the iron core mass at the time of core <b>collapse.</b> We <b>outline</b> that the mass loss in hydrogen-free Wolf-Rayet stars leads to very high C/O ratios at core helium depletion. We argue that a hig...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Concrete, both precast and in situ, is {{frequently}} the first choice, {{and sometimes the}} only choice, for the designers of civil engineering projects. In the residential sector however, concrete experiences stronger competition from other materials such as masonry, steel and timber. Although precast concrete is a mature and developed industry, in the residential sector in particular it is frequently categorised as a MMC, or Modern Method of Construction. This categorisation has {{both positive and negative}} effects for precast as a construction technique for the residential sector. Historical events have also shaped the image and perception of reinforced concrete for housing amongst the public as well as the design fraternity. This paper discusses the relative position and image of precast concrete in the residential sector amongst clients (including the public), designers, producers, contractors and other stakeholders in the construction supply chain. Historical events such as the Ronan Point <b>collapse</b> are <b>outlined.</b> The results of a recent market survey by Loughborough University 1 on the views of the supply chain regarding offsite applications (including precast concrete) are compared and contrasted with a similar study undertaken by Robert Gordon University 2.

40|$|This is {{the text}} of an {{introduction}} to a workshop on asymmetric explosions held in Austin in June, 2003. The great progress in supernova research over thirty-odd years is briefly reviewed. The {{context in which the}} meeting was called is then summarized. The theoretical success of the intrinsically multidimensional delayed detonation paradigm in explaining the nature of Type Ia supernovae coupled with new techniques of observations in the near IR and with spectropolarimetry promise great advances in understanding binary progenitors, the explosion physics, and the ever more accurate application to cosmology. Spectropolarimetry has also revealed the strongly asymmetric nature of core collapse and given valuable perspectives on the supernova - gamma-ray burst connection. The capability of the magneto-rotational instability to rapidly create strong toroidal magnetic fields in the core <b>collapse</b> ambiance is <b>outlined.</b> This physics may be the precursor to driving MHD jets that play a role in asymmetric supernovae.

40|$|THESIS 8606 Calderas are 1 - 100 km diameter, {{volcanic}} depressions {{that form}} primarily through m-scale to km?scale subsidence of a magma reservoir roof into an underlying magma reservoir. This study addresses several fundamental geometric and kinematic {{aspects of the}} structure of caldera volcanoes via a series of scaled physical (or analogue) modelling experiments. Results of these models are combined in detail with observations from natural calderas recorded in the literature, in order to provide as strong an element of ?ground-truthing? for the experimental results as possible. The basic experimental materials and methods are common to all the results chapters (2 - 6), and so for convenience are summarised together in Chapter 1. An exception to some extent is the experiment set described is Chapter 5; these were made with different materials and apparatus, the particulars of which are described in that chapter. Each of the results chapters is otherwise self-contained, with its own specific introduction to the problems addressed, summary of data, discussion, and conclusions. The contents of Chapters 1, 5, and 6 have been published in two peer-reviewed articles. The remaining chapters are presently unpublished, although Chapter 3 and part of Chapter 4 have been submitted for peer review, whilst the rest of Chapter 4 and a part of Chapter 2 will be submitted for publication at a later date. Given the assistance of co-authors in the preparation of manuscripts now integrated into the thesis, my contribution to the individual chapters as presented here may be summarised as: Chapter 1 : 85 %, Chapter 2 : 90 %, Chapter 3 : 75 %, Chapter 4 : 80 %, Chapter 5 : 50 %, Chapter 5 : 75 %. The structure of the thesis, the major aspects of caldera evolution investigated, and the main results are as follows: Chapter 1 : Introduction and Methodology - outlines the current understanding of caldera structure as achieved to date by previous authors and supplies the rationale for using physical models to help unravel caldera evolution. This section also summarises the insights for how these. Details of the experimental methodology employed in this study, as well as scaling considerations for the application of small-scale models to the study of large-scale deformation associated with caldera subsidence in nature, are also provided. Chapter 2 : The Geometry and Evolution of Circular Caldera Collapse Structures - details the results of experimental subsidence of mechanically isotropic reservoir roofs that are circular in plan view. This baseline experiment set illustrates the generalised kinematic evolution of caldera subsidence. Structures resolving radial and concentric strains are documented, the latter for the first time. The control of the roof?s thickness/diameter ratio upon these structures? development is also highlighted. The kinematics of caldera ring faults, the generation of polygonal caldera outlines and the development of piecemeal-type subsidence are also discussed in light of the evidence from experiment and nature. Chapter 3 : The Caldera Collapse Continuum - systematically integrates results of simple circular collapses in Chapter 2 with those from past experimental, numerical and field studies to produce a ?state-of-the-art? synthesis of the mechanics and kinematics of caldera collapse. This synthesis sheds new light on the long-standing but poorly-defined continuum between end-member caldera collapse styles. Structural elements characteristic of each end-member are shown to reflect progressively overlapping structural sub-processes in a single collapse event. The continuum between end-member collapse styles is thus defined primarily as a progressive evolution related to increasing subsidence, although the regulatory role of roof thickness/diameter and caldera subsidence/diameter ratios in the development of structural elements of each collapse end-member is also highlighted. Chapter 4 : The Role of Magma Chamber Ellipticity in Caldera Collapse ? documents the results of experimental collapse of mechanically isotropic reservoir roofs that are varyingly elliptical in plan view. Physical models demonstrate that an elliptical reservoir roof predictably fails first at the ends of its shorter principal axis, and show that lateral propagation (?unzipping?) patterns vary systematically with ellipticity. The models also highlight a characteristic geometric arrangement of elliptical ring structures and provide a first comprehensive view of the elliptical caldera structural architecture in 3 D. Chapters 5 & 6 : Regional tectonic influences on the evolution of caldera <b>collapse</b> ? <b>outlines</b> the results of experimental collapse of reservoir roofs that contain pre-existing mechanical anisotropies in the form of regional-tectonic faults and collapse under regional tectonic stress. Although disregarded in most previous physical and numerical models of calderas, regional faults have long been thought {{to play a major role}} in caldera development, principally through their reactivation during collapse. In Chapter 5, caldera formation in areas of orthogonal regional deformation is examined; in Chapter 6, caldera collapse in strike-slip regimes is investigated. In physical models, regional faults reactivated during collapse where they coincided with and ran parallel to the magma reservoir margins. Here, where syn-collapse strain usually tends to localise, pre-collapse faults are optimally orientated for reactivation. Contrary to inferences from some previous field studies, differential movement on pre-collapse faults was not observed in central parts of the subsiding reservoir roof. Physical models thus confirm that regional fault reactivation is an important process, and help clarify conditions favouring it. Chapter 7 : Summary of Main Conclusions and Outlook - provides a brief overview of the main findings of this thesis, notes their general implications for our understanding of calderas, and outlines some potential avenues for future work. An electronic appendix (DVD) is attached to the back of the thesis. This appendix contains photos of all experiments (in jpeg format), animations of the experiments (in MS PowerPoint files), and copies of the two published articles (in PDF format) ...|$|R
