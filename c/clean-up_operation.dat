5|$|Danish workers {{involved}} in the <b>clean-up</b> <b>operation</b> claimed long-term health problems resulted from their exposure to the radiation. Although they did not work at Camp Hunziker, the Danes worked at the Tank Farm where the contaminated ice was collected, in the port where the contaminated debris was shipped from, and they also serviced the vehicles used in the clean-up. It {{is also possible that}} they were exposed to radiation in the local atmosphere. Many of the workers surveyed in the years following Project Crested Ice reported health problems. A 1995 survey found 410 deaths by cancers out of a sample of 1,500 workers.|$|E
5|$|Melvin's {{first problem}} {{was that there was}} no {{forensic}} evidence. Senior officers had not allowed the estate to be sealed off immediately after the attack, which meant that the crime scene had not been secured. Witnesses and those directly involved were able to leave without giving their names. Objects that might have held fingerprints were not collected. Police were not allowed into the estate in great numbers until 4am, by which time much of the evidence had disappeared. Whatever remained was removed during Haringey Council's <b>clean-up</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Tephra falls {{can cause}} a range of impacts to {{communities}} by disrupting, contaminating and damaging buildings and infrastructure systems, as well as posing a potential health hazard. Coordinated <b>clean-up</b> <b>operations</b> minimise the impacts of tephra on social and economic activities. However, global experience suggests <b>clean-up</b> <b>operations</b> {{are one of the}} most challenging aspects of responding to and recovering from tephra falls in urban environments. Here, we present a method for modelling coordinated municipal-led (town/district level authorities) tephra <b>clean-up</b> <b>operations</b> to support pre-event response and recovery planning. The model estimates the volume of tephra to be removed, clean-up duration, and direct costs. The underpinning component of the model is a scalable clean-up response framework, which identifies and progressively includes more urban surfaces (e. g., roofs, and roads) requiring clean-up with increasing tephra thickness. To demonstrate model applicability, we present four clean-up scenarios for the city of Auckland, New Zealand: 10 mm and 100 mm distal tephra fall across the city, along with two local 2 ̆ 018 wet 2 ̆ 019 eruption scenarios (low and high volume tephra deposition) from within the Auckland Volcanic Field. Depending on the modelled scenario, outputs suggest that coordinated <b>clean-up</b> <b>operations</b> in Auckland could require the removal of tens of thousands to millions of cubic metres of tephra. The cost of these operations are estimated to be NZ 0. 62 ̆ 0131. 1 million (US 0. 42 ̆ 0130. 7 million) for the 10 mm distal tephra scenario and NZ 13. 42 ̆ 01325. 6 million (US 92 ̆ 01317 million) for the 100 mm distal tephra scenario. Estimated clean-up costs of local eruptions range from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars. All eruption scenarios indicate <b>clean-up</b> <b>operations</b> lasting weeks to months, but clean-up in some areas impacted by local eruptions could last for years. The model outputs are consistent with documented historic tephra <b>clean-up</b> <b>operations.</b> Although we use Auckland as a proof-of-concept example, the method may be adapted for any city exposed to a tephra hazard...|$|R

25|$|The {{issue of}} risk was again {{highlighted}} {{in an attack}} by the IRA in January 1979 on a storage tank at the island's Texaco oil terminal. A bomb was detonated at a tank containing aviation fuel, but failed to ignite with the fuel escaping into a safety moat. The Occidental site was abandoned in 1975 leaving a half-built oil refinery, storage tanks, and an unused mile long jetty which cost around £10 million of the approximate total of £60 million spent on the project. However, in the following years the disused and undisturbed site flourished as a haven for wildlife, and in 2003, the final storage tanks were removed in a <b>clean-up</b> <b>operation,</b> and the site was renamed as Canvey Wick and opened as a nature reserve.|$|E
