One {{major difference between}} 2002 and 2016 thinning effects was the radical increase of surface fuel (FWD and CWD) in unthinned units, which likely {{would not have happened}} without the MPB outbreak. These surface fuels are directly tied to increased surface fire behavior and potential for torching. Although thinning was a statistically significant predictor of PT in both 2002 and 2016, 2016 probabilities were higher in unthinned (50 %) than thinned units and therefore more significant, and undesirable, in practical terms. This condition is typical of unmanaged second-growth ponderosa pine−Douglas fir forests impacted by beetles throughout the Interior West and reflects that torching and <b>crowning</b> <b>fire</b> behavior may be commonplace in many unmaintained, post-outbreak units (Jain et al. 2012).|$|E

Area of study: The Sierra Morena mountains (Coordinates ETRS 89 30 N: X: 284793 - 285038; Y: 4218650 - 4218766), southern Spain, and the outdoor facilities of the Lourizán Forest Research Centre, northwestern Spain. Material and methods: The full-scale <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> experiment was conducted in a young Pinus pinea stand. Field data were compared with data predicted using the most used <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> spread models. A small-scale experiment was developed with Pinus pinaster trees to evaluate the role of convection in <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> initiation. Mass loss calorimeter tests were conducted with P. pinea needles to estimate residence time of the flame, which was used to validate the <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> spread model. Main results: The commonly used <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> models underestimated the <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> spread rate observed in the full-scale experiment, but the proposed new integrated approach yielded better fits. Without wind-forced convection, tree crowns did not ignite until flames from an intense surface fire contacted tree foliage.

Regression equations that predict the canopy fuel load by diameter class were developed for Aleppo pine in northern Evia, Greece. The log/log transformation of the allometric model y=axb gave the best fit for all crown fuel components except the branches with diameter > 7. 5 cm. The R 2 values were between 0. 82 and 0. 88 and SEE were small. Forty Aleppo pine trees were classified into groups according to their expected available canopy fuel load, by applying multivariate statistical methods (Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and Canonical Discriminant Analysis) on the values of their most significant dendrometric characteristics (diameter at breast height, total height, live crown length, crown width). Inventory of the critical canopy fuel characteristics that influence the initiation and spread of <b>crown</b> <b>fires</b> was conducted in representative Aleppo pine stands in the Kassandra peninsula, Greece. Vertical profiles of available canopy fuel load, canopy base height and canopy bulk density are presented. Aleppo pine crown fuel complexes are characterized by low canopy base height, while available canopy fuel load and canopy bulk density values are similar with other conifer fuel types worldwide. <b>Crown</b> <b>fire</b> behavior (probability of <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> initiation, <b>fire</b> type, <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> rate of spread, fireline intensity and flame length) in Aleppo pine stands with various surface fuel types and under various meteorological conditions, was simulated with modern and field-tested models of <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> prediction. The simulation results indicated that <b>crown</b> <b>fires</b> in Aleppo pines forests cover a wide range of expected fire behavior. The probability of <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> initiation was found high and passive <b>crown</b> <b>fires</b> and high intensity active <b>crown</b> <b>fires</b> were observed in uneven aged and even aged stands, respectively. Assessment of potential <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> behavior is required in regional fire management planning and suppression tactics. Nomographs for the calculation of the pyric parameters (probability of <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> initiation, active <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> rate of spread, fireline intensity and flame length) of <b>crown</b> <b>fires</b> burning in the Aleppo pines stands in Greece were created. Fuel complexes typical of Aleppo pine forests were comprised and used as inputs to recent models of <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> prediction, in order to calculate the pyric parameters under a wide range of environmental conditions. The results are considered as realistic, based on common experience of <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> behavior in conifer forests, worldwide. Such nomographs are presented for the first time in Greece and are expected to offer substantial help to fire management practice. Fuel treatments that affect <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> behavior in Aleppo pine stands were simulated under extreme and normal fuel moisture conditions.

30|$|We used three {{variables}} {{to assess the}} potential for <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> initiation and spread: CBD based on allometric equations (CBD-allometric), CBD based on stand-level calculations developed by Cruz et al. (2003) (CBD-stand), and the twentieth percentile CBH (CBH- 20). Using the <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> behavior model Nexus (Systems for Environmental Management, Missoula, Montana, USA) we determined what type of <b>fire</b> (surface, passive <b>crown</b> <b>fire,</b> active <b>crown</b> <b>fire,</b> or independent <b>crown</b> <b>fire)</b> would be predicted under average estimations of canopy fuel characteristics for each fire management strategy. Typical fuels and forest management objectives are to prevent <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> spread under very dry conditions, which are represented by the ninetieth percentile weather. For this exercise, we assumed ninetieth percentile conditions for fuel moisture content (FMC) and windspeed measured at the Luna weather station in the Gila NF: 1 hr FMC = 3 %, 10 hr FMC = 3 %, 100 hr FMC = 9 %, woody FMC = 81 %, open windspeed = 17 mph.|$|R

Overall, thinned then MPB-attacked units had less fuel and lower <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> potential than unthinned attacked units. Burned then beetle-attacked units had less canopy fuel and also had lower <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> potential than unburned attacked units.

40|$|Fire {{managers}} are increasingly {{concerned about the}} threat of <b>crown</b> <b>fires,</b> yet only now are quantitative methods for assessing <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> hazard being developed. Links among existing mathematical models of fire behavior are used to develop two indices of <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> hazard—the Torching Index and Crowning Index.

The coupled model was used to simulate the wide range of fire behavior possible in a forest stand, from a low-intensity surface fire to a high-intensity active <b>crown</b> <b>fire,</b> for the purpose of comparing potential fire behavior. The hazard indices and behavior simulations incorporate the effects of surface fuel characteristics, dead and live fuel moistures (surface and crown), slope steepness, canopy base height, canopy bulk density, and wind reduction by the canopy.

30|$|<b>Crown</b> <b>fire</b> hazard {{is often}} cited as a {{justification}} for stand treatment, particularly the need to thin in dry forests. Yet until recently, quantitative analysis of <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> hazard was difficult. Models that link surface and <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> behavior are now being applied widely (Scott and Reinhardt 2001 a). Using variants of earlier models (e.g., Van Wagner 1977, Rothermel 1991), assessments of <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> risk can be produced that are based either on stand characteristics (canopy bulk density, canopy base height) or weather conditions needed to initiate or sustain <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> behavior (torching index and crowning index, both defined in windspeed units). Although the models are empirical, they provide a standard for comparison of risk. In this study, there was little risk of active <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> before or after treatment with canopy bulk density values below 0.070 kg m− 3 (Tables 1 and 3) and crowning indices well above expected windspeeds in the area (Tables 5 and 6). Thinning increased crowning index and therefore reduced <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> hazard. But whatever the crowning index, it must be compared to expected windspeeds {{in the area in}} order to identify real risk. Arbitrary thresholds that define low, moderate, and high crowning potential across a state or region (e.g., Fiedler et al. 2004) need to have a more site-specific interpretation based on local wind data. Given our worst case windspeeds of 36 km hr− 1, and the crowning index average across all units under 97 percentile weather (Table 6), thinning to reduce active <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> potential is an unnecessary action for these conditions. However, thinning may be effective in reducing torching potential, and the potential for bark beetle attack, which would have its own fuel accretion implications over time.|$|R
40|$|To {{control and}} use {{wildland}} fires safely and effectively depends on creditable assessments of fire potential, including the propensity for crowning in conifer forests. Simulation studies that use certain fire modelling systems (i. e. NEXUS, FlamMap, FARSITE, FFE-FVS (Fire and Fuels Extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator), Fuel Manage- ment Analyst (FMAPlus!), BehavePlus) based on separate implementations or direct integration of Rothermel’s surface and <b>crown</b> rate of <b>fire</b> spread models with Van Wagner’s <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> transition and propagation models are {{shown to have}} a significant underprediction bias when used in assessing potential <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> behaviour in conifer forests of western North America. The principal sources of this underprediction bias are shown to include: (i) incompatible model linkages; (ii) use of surface and <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> rate of spread models that have an inherent underprediction bias; and (iii) reduction in <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> rate of spread based on the use of unsubstantiated crown fraction burned functions. The use of uncalibrated custom fuel models to represent surface fuelbeds is a fourth potential source of bias. These sources are described and documented in detail based on comparisons with experimental fire and wildfire observations and on separate analyses of model components. The manner in which the two primary canopy fuel inputs influencing <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> initiation (i. e. foliar moisture content and canopy base height) is handled in these simulation studies and the meaning of Scott and Reinhardt’s two <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> hazard indices are also critically examined...|$|R

40|$|In Colorado and {{southern}} Wyoming, mountain pine beetle (MPB) has affected over 1. 6 million ha of predominantly lodgepole pine forests, raising concerns about effects of MPB-caused mortality on subsequent wildfire risk and behavior. Using empirical data we modeled potential fire behavior across a gradient of wind speeds and moisture scenarios in Green stands compared three stages since MPB attack (Red [1 – 3 yrs], Grey [4 – 10 yrs], and Old-MPB [, 30 yrs]). MPB killed 50 % {{of the trees}} and 70 % of the basal area in Red and Grey stages. Across moisture scenarios, canopy fuel moisture was one-third lower in Red and Grey stages compared to the Green stage, making active <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> possible at lower wind speeds and less extreme moisture conditions. More-open canopies and high loads of large surface fuels due to treefall in Grey and Old-MPB stages significantly increased surface fireline intensities, facilitating active <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> at lower wind speeds (. 30 – 55 km/hr) across all moisture scenarios. Not accounting for low foliar moistures in Red and Grey stages, and large surface fuels in Grey and Old-MPB stages, underestimates the occurrence of active <b>crown</b> <b>fire.</b> Under extreme burning conditions, minimum wind speeds for active <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> were 25 – 35 km/hr lower for Red, Grey and Old-MPB stands compared to Green.

30|$|Fuel {{treatments}} in {{forests are}} often designed to decrease <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> behavior (i.e., propensity for <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> ignition or spread) by reducing canopy and surface fuels, and increase {{resistance to fire}} (i.e, overstory survival) by favoring fire-tolerant species and removing competition. Fire exclusion and canopy ingrowth {{over the past century}} have elevated surface and canopy fuel loading in the western US (Parsons and DeBenedetti 1979, Covington and Moore 1994, Keeling et al. 2006). Increased surface and canopy fuel loading in conjunction with a warmer and drier climate have caused wildfires to increase in size and frequency, resulting in greater suppression costs to protect resources (Westerling et al. 2006, Flannigan et al. 2009, Miller et al. 2009). <b>Crown</b> <b>fires</b> threaten human safety and property, and, in forest types where <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> is uncharacteristic, it also threatens ecological resilience (Savage and Nystrom Mast 2005). Fuel reduction is a proactive silvicultural treatment that alters potential fire behavior by removing and modifying fuels to encourage low-severity (low overstory mortality) surface fire instead of high-severity (high overstory mortality) <b>crown</b> <b>fire.</b> Fuel treatments are typically designed to reduce surface fuel loading and canopy densities; increase heights to canopy base; and retain large, fire resistant trees (Agee and Skinner 2005, Hessburg et al. 2015).

40|$|The article discuss {{one of the}} {{priority}} security problems in Russia, which is elaboration of the strategic system of the forest and society safeguards from catastrophic forest <b>crown</b> <b>fires</b> in connection with rapid climate warming. It is postulated, that a most effective and reliable barrier for the dispersal of the intensive <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> in a coniferous forest massive can be a sufficiently wide strip of deciduous tree species – «deciduous forest barrier», which has phytomass capable of absorbing <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> energy and transforming them to surface fire, which may be extinguished by technical means. The actuality of the natural study of the transition parameters from the <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> to surface fire has been noted, depending on climate, fire intensity and the deciduous barrier structure. The results of the quantitative natural investigation {{of the consequences of}} catastrophic <b>crown</b> <b>fires</b> of 2004 in the island pine forests of forest-steppe zone in Kurgan Oblast, which passed through the belt of 50 – 70 year-old birch stands of middle density, has been cited and formalized mathematically. It has been shown, that 150 m width of deciduous forest barrier is necessary as a minimum for the reliable transition of the high intensive front <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> to surface fire in the forest-steppe conditions of the Western Siberia, but this width reduces with a decreasing heating effect. It has been proposed to create the complex fire-prevention forest belts of different construction for the protection of forests, industrial objects and settlements. Besides a basic deciduous barrier, their structure should include technologically necessary buffer zones and zones for the localization and extinguishing surface fire, which stop a <b>crown</b> <b>fire.</b> It has been recommended to use natural regeneration of deciduous tree species, as a most effective and non-deficient method for the creation of deciduous forest barriers in the predominant forest types, except the lichen pine forests, where creating deciduous belts is necessary...|$|R
30|$|Mechanical {{treatments}} {{had mixed}} effects on fire type. With 90 th percentile windspeed, {{two of the}} three forest types were predicted to have surface fire pre- and post-treatment, and the third experienced a reduction in potential passive <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> as a result of treatment. With gusty winds, all three forest types were predicted to experience some passive or conditional <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> pre-treatment, and {{two of the three}} sites maintained some <b>crown</b> <b>fire</b> post-treatment, although the proportion was reduced. The mixed results found in this study are likely due to the relatively low number of replicates and the variety of mechanical treatments implemented. Some of the mechanical treatments targeted overstory fuels (i.e., whole tree removal and thinning) and others ladder and surface fuels (i.e., hand cutting and piling, thinning followed by chipping, and mastication). For example, RF-MT had the highest post-treatment canopy bulk density out of all five forest-treatment combinations, resulting in the highest proportion of post-treatment conditional <b>crown</b> <b>fire.</b> The LN-MT treatments had elevated levels of 1 h, 10 h and 100 h fuels post-treatment, resulting in the only post-treatment forest-combination to retain some passive <b>crown</b> <b>fire.</b> The variety of treatments completed and the fact that no fuel treatment will uniformly alter forest and fuel structure due to the inherent variability in natural ecosystems explains part of the resulting modeled fire type.|$|R

40|$|<b>Crown</b> <b>fires</b> are {{extremely}} dangerous, {{very difficult to}} fight and often have a rate of spread over 100 times more than a surface fire. Therefore, {{it is important to}} determine the type of forest fire in the early detection based on wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to adopt the proper strategy to fight the fire. It is shown that this could be done analyzing the noise power spectrum of forest fires: surface fires noise spectrum can be modeled as the red noise (gradual increase of trend line amplitude toward lower frequencies), while for <b>crown</b> <b>fires</b> noise spectrum trend line has an almost bell-shaped (Gaussian) type. The noise frequency range is relatively narrow for <b>crown</b> <b>fires</b> and ranged from 250 to 450 Hz. The intermediate type of fires (strong surface <b>fire</b> and incipient <b>crown</b> <b>fire)</b> has a transient noise spectrum from broadband red to narrowband Gaussian. The article presents the spectrums of 9 different forest fires. The different trend line of the forest fire noise power spectrum is the parameter {{that can be used to}} determine the type of forest fire in WSNs...|$|R

Scattering the solid agent from explosion is greatly influenced by external environmental and airflow in fire, which results in the low efficiency of extinguishing agent. Dispersion area of grenade scattering extinguishing agent can be calculated through the combination of numerical simulation and experimental determination. On the base of high extinguishing concentration, the structure of grenade is optimized and the efficiency of extinguishing agent is improved. For monoclonal <b>crown</b> <b>fire,</b> specific central explosive about 1. 5 % and the ratio of height to diameter is 3. 5, the extinguishing agent the dispersion uniformity, use reduced by more than 20 %...|$|R
