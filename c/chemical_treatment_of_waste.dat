The factors involved were amounts lime (i. e. pH) and filter aid added the OWE on clarification and filtration rates. At pH> 10, the clarification rate was increased and the final volume of the concentrated suspension (sludge) was reduced, while filter aid affected negatively the clarification rate. The filtration rate was also increased when the coagulation was carried out at pH> 10. The floculated particle suspension should be concentrated before filtration in order to decrease the filtration duration.

In the present paper the effect of collagen hydrolysate (CH) and glycerol on PVA water sensitivity has been investigated. CH content affects water penetration into the prepared blown films, affecting therefore their solubility. An increasing content of CH in PVA based blends shortens the time to the first disruption of the film after immersing in water, restraining the negative effect of glycerol on solubility. Pure PVA film presented limited biodegradation at low temperature (5 oC). The CH addition in the blend significantly increases biodegradation rate at that temperature.

40|$|During the {{production}} of ferrochrome in electric arc furnaces, a dust is captured in baghouse filters {{as a means of}} air pollution control. This dust contains various metals such as chromium, zinc, iron, aluminium and magnesium. Due to the presence of hexavalent chromium in the dust, which is both toxic and carcinogenic, it requires disposal at a hazardous waste disposal site, entailing high cost. The possibility exists that these costs could be reduced if metals such as zinc can be recovered from the dust through, inter alia, leaching. Experiments were performed to determine suitable conditions for the leaching of zinc from such a baghouse dust. A two step leaching procedure was followed which prevented the formation of silica gel. The most favourable conditions for zinc extraction was with a sulphuric acid concentration of 336 g/l and an acid to dust ratio of 0, 56. Under these conditions zinc was selectively leached with regard to iron and aluminium. The percentage recovery for zinc was 71, 2 %, aluminium 1, 8 % and iron 0, 1 %. It was concluded that the second step (dilution) of leaching did not have a significant influence on the percentage extraction of metals from the dust. Consideration <b>of</b> the <b>chemical</b> <b>treatment</b> cost <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> streams produced led to the conclusion that zinc recovery from baghouse dust is not an economically feasible project viewed in isolation.

40|$|The {{effect of}} sewage sludge (SS) {{flocculation}} with FeCl 3 on biological availability of Zn, Ni, Cd and Cu in oilseed rape (Brassica napus) plants grown on a acid and a neutral soil were studied during a greenhouse incubation experiment. The experiment included the following treatments: (i) unamended control soil, (ii) sewage sludge amended soils kept bare throughout the experiment and (iii) sewage sludge amended soil planted with oilseed rape. Amended soils received untreated or FeCl 3 treated SS at a rate equivalent to 75 t d. w. ha- 1 y- 1. Plant growth was enhanced by addition of both untreated and FeCl 3 treated SS, but sludge treated with FeCl 3 produced a lower shoot dry matter than untreated SS, particularly in the acid soil. Evaluation of biological availability of potentially toxic elements (PTE) was performed by three different methods: plant shoot analysis, single DTPA-extraction and sequential fractionation procedure (SEP). After 50 days, accumulation of PTE was considerably larger in plant shoots grown on the acid soil and amended with FeCl 3 treated sludge. Conversely, the FeCl 3 treated SS reduced Cd, Ni and Zn accumulation in shoots in the neutral soil. Copper was generally unaffected by SS treatment in both soils. Plants decreased significantly the DTPA-extractability of Cd, Ni and Zn in both soils that received Fe-SS, {{but they did not}} change it in soils that received untreated SS. These different behaviours may be explained by the different mechanism involved in metals stabilization in the two soils: adsorption on Fe and Mn oxides in the neutral soil, precipitation and organic complexation in the acid soil. The <b>chemical</b> flocculation <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> water with FeCl 3 reduces PTE availability in neutral soils amended with SS, but markedly increases their solubility and bio-availability in acid soils. Therefore, the application of SS obtained from flocculation with FeCl 3 should be restricted to neutral or calcareous soils...|$|R

However, the spent pot-liner waste produced by the aluminium smelters accumulates with time into a considerable amount threatening the Canadian environment, especially that of Quebec. A new-engineered material, known as glass fit (GF) has been developed through the <b>chemical</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> such <b>waste.</b> GF shows potential hydraulic and pozzolanic properties. GF has been studied as a binder itself and as a supplementary cementitious material (SCM). The activation of industrial by-products into clinkerless binders is a novel trend that has {{attracted the attention of}} many researchers. The activation of GF into binder to produce paste, mortar and concrete was the first aim of this study. Potential activation of GF using different types and combinations of inorganic activators and temperatures of activation was successfully achieved and high strength concretes were obtained. Moreover, mortars with high compressive strength were obtained with well-formulated activators at ambient temperature. On the other hand, the utilization of industrial by-products as a partial replacement for cement in concrete is a widespread practice. As GF contains a high concentration of sodium in its structure, there is a concern as to the effect of sodium content on the development of alkali-silica reaction (ASR) expansion of concrete. Therefore, this study also aimed to investigate the effect of GF sodium content in the enhancement of ASR expansion and to find new synergistic mixtures that can effectively mitigate ASR expansion in the long term. We observed that ASR expansion decreases with the replacement level of GF. Different synergistic diagrams containing known SCM (silica fume, fly ash, and slag) were achieved from which different effective mixtures can effectively alleviate ASR expansion. In conclusion, the use of GF in the manufacture of concrete has great benefits. Economically, it could save millions of Canadian dollars needed for the <b>treatment</b> and landfilling <b>of</b> spent pot-liner <b>waste.</b> Ecologically, it could reduce GHG emissions associated with the production of cement clinkers.

40|$|Glycerol is {{the main}} {{byproduct}} from biodiesel production and {{expected to be a}} cheap feedstock for the production of useful substances. Furthermore, waste glycerol (WG) which is released from biodiesel production has a high pH level as well as contains toxic <b>chemicals.</b> <b>Treatment</b> <b>of</b> this <b>waste</b> requires a high cost, in turns raising cost to the biodiesel industry. Therefore, glycerol and WG should be either utilized or treated properly to make the biodiesel industry to be more competitive as well as to reduce the environmental burden. Here, in the framework of this thesis two approaches were taken: (1) Utilize glycerol as a feedstock for producing hydrogen via metabolic engineering in Escherichia coli; and (2) Bioremediation <b>of</b> WG and <b>waste</b> activated sludge (WAS) to produce biofuels (hydrogen and methane) and to reduce sludge. E. coli is a potential microorganism for hydrogen production because it can sustain a high growth rate, requires simple technology and could achieve a high hydrogen yield and production. However, hydrogen production from glycerol by E. coli is still not effective because of slow cell growth and low hydrogen production. Thus, we aimed to enhance hydrogen production from glycerol by using E. coli which can be easily manipulated. We took to sub-approaches: (i) improvement of glycerol metabolism toward hydrogen production by metabolic engineering; and (ii) random transposon mutagenesis to find beneficial knockouts for hydrogen production. In the first approach, a novel engineered strain with seven knockouts, BW 25113 frdC ldhA fdnG ppc narG mgsA hycA was constructed and it shows 5 -fold higher hydrogen productivity (μmol H 2 / mg protein) than the parent strain. In the other approach, four genes, aroM, gatZ, ycgR, and yfgI were found by transposon mutagenesis and these knockouts showed better growth rate and hydrogen production. In the second approach, WAS which is released from the waste water treatment plant (WWTP), and is an environmental burden. Conventional treatment methods such as heating or dumping of WAS often require either high cost or large landfill, respectively. In practice, it is estimated that WAS treatment accounts for a half of the operating cost of the WWTP. By utilizing WAS as a microbial source to degrade glycerol and alkaline pH characteristic of WG to reduce WAS quantity, the anaerobic digestion was conduced with different WAS and WG ratios to figure out the optimal condition for sludge reduction and biofuel production. It is found that WAS was reduced by 62 % under the condition of 25 % WAS and 50 % WG. Moreover, anaerobic digestion of 10 % WAS and 1 % WG was the optimal condition for producing hydrogen and methane. At this mode, hydrogen and methane production was increased by 24 and 8 fold in comparison to those of without supplementation of WG, respectively. Finally, codigestion of WAS and WG is economically viable for the WWTP, and this technique is more beneficial for the biodiesel fuels production manufactures. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号:生工博甲第 232 号 学位授与年月日:平成 27 年 3 月 25 日 1.

40|$|Colombo City is the {{commercial}} capital of Sri Lanka {{with an estimated}} resident population of over 750, 000 spread over 3741 hectares (ha) and has a population density over 1188 per ha. It {{is located in the}} western coast of Sri Lanka and is in wet zone. The topography is of flat terrain with a mix of land and water. Considering the population and the limited undeveloped land available, the disposal <b>of</b> Municipal Solid <b>Waste</b> (MSW) and Sewer is a major environmental problem in Colombo. The major object of this thesis is to identify and evaluate a productive waste management system that is not only environmental friendly but also sustainable and cost effective. In this context, as a sustainable technology, applicability of anaerobic digestion is investigated and methane generation potential <b>of</b> the <b>waste</b> is evaluated. In order to identify a sustainable waste management system, the quantity <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> generated within the city of Colombo is identified. The current practices of disposal <b>of</b> these <b>wastes</b> are then reviewed to identify any issues regarding its sustainability. The majority of the MSW is currently disposed as open landfill that is causing pollution of waterways, with its leachate, as well as the polluting the atmosphere around it with its bad odour. The sewer is discharged to sea or disposed via a self-contained soakage pit. Except for few small-scale anaerobic digestion plants that use solid <b>waste</b> for generation <b>of</b> biogas for localized use, there is no large-scale waste to energy projects in operation in Sri Lanka. The sewer is not used productively at all. Having identified the quantity <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> and the disposal methods practiced, the priority is to identify sustainable and productive methods <b>of</b> disposal <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> that suits best the local conditions. With this in view research hitherto carried out are studied and available literature is reviewed. The objective is to ascertain the processes that productively harness the energy potential of MSW and Sewer, individually or in combination. There are many physical and <b>chemical</b> methods for <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes.</b> However bioconversion <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> provides the best options for tapping the energy <b>of</b> the <b>wastes.</b> <b>Of</b> the two main bioconversion methods aanaerobic processes exhibit many advantages over aerobic digestion with its ability of handling high organic loading rates and low sludge production. However, the reason for the increase in applications of anaerobic processes, is, its potential for production of energy using the biogas generated. The methane so produced can replace fossil fuel and therefore has a direct positive effect on greenhouse gas reduction. Therefore, compared with other bioconversion technologies for <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> MSW and sewer/wastewater, the energy and environment benefits make anaerobic digestion an attractive option. Anaerobic <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> in an engineered landfill bioreactor is found to be the best option for <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> MSW. Whilst providing a decrease in long term environmental risks and low operational and closure costs it provides with valuable energy source in generation of methane. As for sewer generation of methane in anaerobic processes can be enhanced with co-digestion of different types <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> suitably selected. In this regard co-digestion of sewer and wastewater with food waste is found to be productive and is applied in this study. Literature review is carried out to determine suitable models to predict the methane generation potential. The "First Order Decay Model" is identified as the appropriate model for prediction of methane from MSW in landfills. The "Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 " is applied for prediction of methane from sewer and waste water. Chemical composition of MSW is the primary parameter which affects the methane generation. The chemical composition is computed applying the ultimate analysis and using a stoichiometric based approach. For sewer and waste water the basic parameters of BOD and COD concentrations are available from data gathered. Apart from these two parameters the other parameters relevant to local conditions are not available. Therefore values that closely fit the local conditions are taken from the literature. The study determines the methane generation potential of MSW approximately 2. 1 x 106 m 3 per annum and anaerobic co-digestion of sewer and food substrates generate 9. 1 x 106 m 3 per annum. If parameters could be determined for the wastes generated locally the accuracy of the methane generation potential could be further enhanced. In this context, further studies, should be directed from the conventional landfills to "Anaerobic Bioreactor Controlled" landfill, where circulation of liquids including leachate is carried out to increase the biogas yield. For sewer the focus should be on the most economical foot print of parallel banks of number of continuous-flow stirred-tank reactors (CSTR) operating in series to accommodate the total flow rate of sewer...|$|R
