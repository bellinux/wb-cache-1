We study how to hide attributes in an optimal way. We show that it is NP-hard to compute the optimal attribute hiding scheme. We then derive a polynomial-time solvable upper bound on the optimal revenue. Finally, we propose two heuristicbased attribute hiding schemes. Experiments show that revenue achieved by these schemes is close to the upper bound. ...|$|E

To do this we collect new data on the decentralization of investment, hiring, production, and sales decisions from Corporate Headquarters to local plant managers in almost 4, 000 firms in the United States, Europe, and Asia. We find that firms headquartered in high trust regions {{are more likely to}} decentralize, with trust accounting for about half of the variation in decentralization in our data. To help identify causal effects, we look within multinational firms, and show that higher levels of bilateral trust between the multinational's country of origin and subsidiary's <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> increases decentralization, even after instrumenting trust using religious and ethnic similarities between the countries. Trust raises aggregate productivity through two channels: (1) trust facilitates reallocation between firms by allowing more efficient firms to grow as CEOs can decentralize more decisions and (2) trust complements the adoption of new technologies, thereby increasing productivity within firms during times of rapid technological change. decentralization, trust, Rule of Law, social capital, theory of the firm...|$|E

We focus on firms that switch from being a purely domestic firm to being a multinational firm. Our identification strategy of switching firms, i. e. Japanese firms investing for the first time abroad between 1995 and 2003, relies on the confrontation of information coming from two different data sets: the basic survey on Overseas Business Activities conducted annually by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and the basic survey of Japanese Business Structure and Activities (BSBSA).

Despite strict laws prohibiting adult offenders from exploiting youth, these individuals aggressively pursue minors to commit crimes {{associated with the}} support of terrorist organizations. This quasi-experimental, cross-sectional study used resource dependency theory to explore the likelihood that adult criminal offenders in the U.

Data were collected from a crime database maintained by the United States Sentencing Commission for 2012. Logistic regression was conducted to assess if crime typology, <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin, and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> crime predicted the use of minors for crime by adult offenders in support of terrorist organizations. Results of the analysis were significant: Ï? 2 (7, N= 485) = 180. 18, p 3 ̆c. 001, suggesting that crime typology, <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin, and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> crime were significant predictors of the use of minors in crimes that are associated with the support of terrorist organizations.

Positive social change implications stemming from this study include a recommendation to Congress to increase federal funding for law enforcement agencies and social programs, thereby improving the lives of minors that otherwise may become victims of adult criminal offenders who seek to use them to commit crimes in support of terrorist organizations...|$|R

Using data collected by means of a survey, the paper examines the question of the existence of different sequences followed by companies to innovate their operations. A sample of 125 U.

On the basis of the initiative start-up year, four different sequences have been found.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper we analyze the effects of {{investing}} abroad using firm-level data for Japan for the period 1994 - 2004. We adopt propensity score matching techniques in combination with a difference-in-differences (DID) estimator to evaluate the causal effect of establishing a foreign affiliate {{on a set of}} domestic outcome variables of interest. We rely on a new dataset that combines parents’ and subsidiaries ’ characteristics to uncover how the effect of investing abroad on employment, investment, productivity and trade performance varies considerably across firms and depends on a variety of conditions related to the FDI motives and their affiliates ’ characteristics. Preliminary results suggest that Japanese outward FDI has limited effects on domestic employment and performance of internationalizing firms on average. However results differ significantly depending on the sector (manufacturing versus non manufacturing), <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> and the FDI type (vertical or horizontal). We find horizontal FDI more likely to spur productivity growth but at the expenses of export performance. Fears of job losses associated with production relocation are rejected on average but results strongly vary depending on the country of destination. Japanese manufacturers that established a foreign affiliate in rich countries (especially North America) enjoyed significant white collar employment creation. Although horizontal FDI seems to create TFP gains on average, increase in productivity for vertical FDI is only witnessed in low income countries. Fears of “Hollowing out ” effects seem to be justified in the case of relocation to low income countries, for which a contraction of employment and investment is observed...|$|E

The orchards were newly planted or established, had widely varying apple leaf midge populations and {{were subjected to}} different pesticide management regimes. The Julian date of the peak catch of midges in the sex pheromone traps increased approximately linearly with increasing generation number. There was also a strong increasing relationship between the Julian date of peak catch and increasing absolute value of latitude. A linear relationship was fitted {{within the range of}} 41 - 51 degrees latitude included. Strong linear relationships on log-log transformed scales were found between the total and peak numbers of midges caught per generation and the populations of galls that developed subsequently. The best fit of log 10 (total galls/ha)  =  2. 138  + log 10 (total no. midges caught/generation) was obtained for the first and second generations. The relationship indicates that each male midge caught in a trap for a particular generation corresponds to approximately 137 galls being formed per hectare subsequently for that generation, providing that there are sufficient shoots and tender young leaves present to accommodate them. Clearly the proportion of shoots and leaves galled per hectare will depend on the numbers of shoots and leaves present in the particular orchard but knowledge of these parameters should allow simple estimates to be made. The regressions were significantly weakened when the third and especially the fourth generations were included, largely because of gall saturation or because tree growth had ceased. The relationships were not significantly affected by pesticide management regime, orchard age or <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>location.</b> In a further study, a good correspondence was found between pheromone trap catches and the percentage of shoots infested with eggs of D. mali for the first and second generation in an experimental orchard in Kent during 2006. The results indicate that the sex pheromone traps are effective for monitoring the flight activity of successive generations of D. mali, can be used to predict the severity of galling attacks to shoots and are likely to be useful for timing insecticide sprays...|$|E
