40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} prototyping of a low-cost portable mechanical ventilator for use in mass casualty cases and resource-poor environments. The ventilator delivers breaths by compressing a conventional bag-valve mask (BVM) with a pivoting <b>cam</b> <b>arm,</b> {{eliminating the need for}} a human operator for the BVM. An initial prototype was built out of acrylic, measuring 11. 25 x 6. 7 x 8 inches (285 x 170 x 200 mm) and weighing 9 lbs (4. 1 kg). It is driven by a stepper motor powered by a 14. 8 VDC battery and features an adjustable tidal volume of up to 900 mL, adjustable breaths per minute (bpm) of 5 - 30, and inhalation to exhalation time ratio (i:e ratio) options of 1 : 2, 1 : 3 and 1 : 4. Tidal volume, breaths per minute and i:e ratio are set via user-friendly knobs, and the settings are displayed on an LCD screen. The prototype also features an assist-control mode and an alarm to indicate over-pressurization of the system. Future iterations of the device will be fully calibrated to medical standards and include all desired ventilator features. Future iterations will be further optimised for low power-consumption and will be designed for manufacture and assembly. With a prototyping cost of only $ 420, the bulk-manufacturing price for the ventilator is estimated to be less than $ 100. Through this prototype, the strategy of cam-actuated BVM compression is proven to be a viable option to achieve low-cost, low-power portable ventilator technology that provides essential ventilator features {{at a fraction of the}} cost of existing technology.

40|$|The {{construction}} of a machine called CANIBAL which is capable of simulating {{the actions of the}} human mandible during chewing is reported. Powered by an electric motor, a <b>cam</b> activated rocker <b>arm</b> assembly transmits force by means of wires to each point on the mandible where muscles would be attached. A separately adjustable <b>cam,</b> rocker <b>arm,</b> directional pulley and wire represents each muscle. Models of dental arches cast in dental stone or other materials can be mounted and subjected to extended wear. With different cam settings, wear patterns can be produced which resemble those seen on various fossil and living human dental arches...|$|R
50|$|Two {{distinct}} cam profiles {{are used}} to provide two engine modes: a low-speed mode, consisting of low-lift cam profiles; and a high-speed mode. The low-lift <b>cams</b> and rocker <b>arms</b> - which drive separate intake valves - are positioned {{on either side of}} a centrally located high-lift cam. Each of the intake valves is operated by a low-lift <b>cam</b> and rocker <b>arm,</b> while placing a T-lever between them allows the valves to follow the action of the high-lift cam.|$|R

40|$|A {{variable}} pitch fan actuation system was designed which incorporates a remote nacelle-mounted blade angle regulator. The regulator drives a rotating fan-mounted mechanical actuator through a flexible shaft and differential gear train. The actuator incorporates a high ratio harmonic drive attached to a multitrack spherical cam which changes blade pitch through individual <b>cam</b> follower <b>arms</b> attached to each blade trunnion. Detail design parameters of the actuation system are presented. These include the following: design philosophies, operating limits, mechanical, hydraulic and thermal characteristics, mechanical efficiencies, materials, weights, lubrication, stress analyses, reliability and failure analyses...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the successful {{application of a}} constraint-based modelling to improve the performance of an overwrapping packaging machine. The constraint-based modelling was employed to manipulate the geometry of the individual components and their assemblies until conditions of minimum misalignment forces were achieved. The designs arising from this approach moved the ground points away from their original positions and modified the geometry of the <b>cam</b> follower <b>arms.</b> It also allowed a single camshaft to be used, which enabled {{a reduction in the}} number of parts. A prototype of the new design was constructed, installed in the complete machine, and evaluated. All the performance requirements were met...|$|R
50|$|Early {{versions}} of the cam systems used a Gibbs-style type 1 ascender placed in an inverted position attached to a soloer's sit harness opposite to the manufacturer's intended use. The combination of a climber's body position in a fall and friction between the ascender frame and the rope provides the activating leverage for the cam to grab the rope. Fall forces generated using this device and the cam profile can be enough to damage a rope due to the high clamp loads induced by the <b>cam</b> lever <b>arm.</b> The main drawback to this system {{is that it is}} like the prussik knot system where the soloer also has to feed out an estimate amount of rope in order to reach a stance point.|$|R

These were cargo ships equipped with a catapult for launching an aircraft, but without facilities to recover them. Thus, if the aircraft were not in range of a land base, pilots were forced to bail out and {{be picked up by}} the ship. They were informally known as [...] "Hurricats".|$|R

The {{dimensions of the}} radiometer are 0. 9 meter square by 0. 1 meter, and its weighs 32 kilograms. Rigidly secured to the spacecraft during launch, the radiometer is deployed when the spacecraft reaches orbit. Deployment is achieved without permitting any portion of the radiometer to intersect {{the field of view}} of the infrared horizon scanner. This accomplishment necessitated a nonlinear deployment profile, which was accomplished by using a four-bar linkage composed of <b>arms,</b> <b>cams,</b> pivots, and steel tapes...|$|R
40|$|Camshaft can {{be defined}} as a machine element having the curve {{outlined}} or a curved grooved, gives the predetermined specified motion to another element called the follower. In automotive field, Camshaft and its follower take importance roles to run the engine. Nowadays the car maker have developed the vary schemes of cam profile to match with the engine performance. Since the system deals with high load and high speed and many analyses have been carried out on the failure of the components. The analysis is done either by experimental or finite element analysis. The result from the finite element analysis is an approximate of the component failure. In the mean time, the software development is improving in this few decades. Problems with the components such as <b>cam</b> and rocker <b>arm</b> are wears while the valve bends. This project aim determines the stress concentration on the cam and followers during normal operation. More over, this project used the <b>cam,</b> rocker <b>arms,</b> valve lifter, exhaust valve and accessories used in 4 G 13 engine in type. Solidworks, Cosmosmotion and Algor software are used for determination of stress concentration on the components. The finite element analysis are done for determination of stress concentration during 30 degree of cam where the roller fully climbing the cam and during maximum exhaust valve lift. Cam is rotated at 2000 rpm, 3000 rpm and 6000 rpm of crank rotation. In the analysis, the typical values for coefficient of friction, materials, and spring rate are used. The result from finite element analysis showed that the maximum stress concentration occurred at rocker arm that leads to the failure of the component. Value for maximum stress is over the allowable stress for rocker arm material. Other components are approximately safe where the maximum stress is not over the allowable stress for components...|$|R
50|$|The M30 was {{originally}} {{developed in the}} late 1960s, loosely based on the straight-four BMW M10 engine first used in the 'Neue Klasse' BMW 1500. Several features, including a profile lowering 30-degree slant to the right, a crossflow head (a gas flow head in later designs) and a chain-driven single overhead <b>cam</b> with rocker <b>arm</b> valve actuation are common between the M10 and the M30. Further similarities include a cast-iron block with an aluminium head and a forged crankshaft. The first two engines introduced were the 2.8 and the 2.5 litre option, both short-stroke engines sharing a common bore.|$|R
5000|$|The {{desmodromic}} system avoids this problem, {{because it}} does not have to overcome the static energy of the spring. It must work against the momentum of the valve opening and closing, and that force still depends on the effective mass of the moving parts. The effective mass of a traditional valve with spring includes one-half of the valve spring mass and all of the valve spring retainer mass. However, a desmodromic system must deal with the inertia of the two rocker arms per valve, so this advantage depends greatly on the skill of the designer. Another disadvantage is the contact point between the <b>cams</b> and rocker <b>arms.</b> It is relatively easy to use roller tappets in conventional valvetrains, although it does add considerable moving mass. In a desmodromic system the roller would be needed {{at one end of the}} rocker arm, which would greatly increase its moment-of-inertia and negate its [...] "effective mass" [...] advantage. Thus, desmo systems have generally needed to deal with sliding friction between the <b>cam</b> and rocker <b>arm</b> and therefore may have greater wear. The contact points on most Ducati rocker arms are hard-chromed to reduce this wear. Another possible disadvantage is that it would be very difficult to incorporate hydraulic valve lash adjusters in a desmodromic system, so the valves must be periodically adjusted, but this is true of typical performance oriented motorcycles as valve lash is typically set using a shim under a cam follower.|$|R

Created the 3 D Model in PRO/E and imported it into the Kinematics simulation software ADAMS, analyzing Groove-cam’s offset angle, Connecting-rod’s length {{and its impact on}} the Plant-arm’s kinematics locus. The effect laws of the structural parameters on the Plant-arm’s locus were obtained through analyzing the Plant-arm’s locus, which got by changing the groove cam’s horizontal offset angle ranging from 0 ° to 20 °, the sum of Connecting-rod’s length ranging from 130 mm to 150 mm, and the subtract of Connecting-rod’s length ranging from 15 mm to 25 mm.

50|$|Document cameras, {{also known}} as visual presenters, visualisers (in the United Kingdom), digital overheads, or docucams, are {{real-time}} image capture devices for displaying an object to a large audience. Like an opaque projector, a document camera is able to magnify and project the images of actual, three-dimensional objects, as well as transparencies. They are, in essence, high resolution web <b>cams,</b> mounted on <b>arms</b> so as to facilitate their placement over a page. This allows a teacher, lecturer or presenter to write {{on a sheet of}} paper or to display a two or three-dimensional object while the audience watches. Theoretically, all objects can be displayed by a document camera. Most objects are simply placed under the camera. The camera takes the picture which in turn produces a live picture using a projector or monitor. Different types of document camera/visualizer allow great flexibility in terms of placement of objects. Larger objects, for example, can simply be placed {{in front of the camera}} and the camera rotated as necessary,or a ceiling mounted document camera can also be used to allow a larger working area to be used.|$|R
5000|$|Replacing the 2.7-litre 'biturbo' V6 {{engine of}} the {{previous}} generation B5 S4, the new B6 S4 powertrain gained an all-aluminium alloy 4.2-litre, 40 valve (five valves per cylinder) V8 engine (parts code prefix: 079.C, identification code: BBK), with chain-driven double overhead camshafts, roller-finger rocker <b>arm</b> <b>cam</b> followers, and included variable inlet camshaft timing. It also utilised a strengthened alloy crankshaft bedplate for the five main bearings, and a two-part baffled oil sump, and a light-alloy variable intake manifold (VIM), containing the fractionally sequentially actuated fuel injectors. This petrol engine, based on the unit from the Audi A8, displaces , and it produces a motive power output of [...] at 7,000 revolutions per minute (rpm), and generates torque of 410 Nm at 3,500 rpm, making it more potent than the RS2 Avant, and nearly as powerful as the B5 RS4. Engine management was {{by way of a}} Bosch Motronic ME 7.1.1 electronic engine control unit (ECU), utilising a Bosch 'E-Gas' drive by wire electronic throttle, and powering eight individual spark coils with longlife quad-electrode Bosch spark plugs. Ignition timing is a mapped direct ignition, with cylinder-selective knock control with the aid of four knock sensors. The exhaust system includes vacuum-operated valves in the twin rear silencers (mufflers), finished with chrome plated tail-pipes.|$|R
40|$|It is {{the object}} of the {{presented}} paper to provide an electromechanical rotary valve actuating system for opening and closing valves of an internal combustion engine capable of separately controlling both the inlet and exhaust valve operations of each individual cylinder in a multi-cylinder engine. This indicates that only one valve will be required for each cylinder of the engine. Previously published versions of this concept require a separate valve for intake and exhaust in each cylinder. The system provides an alternative to the camshaft assembly in an attempt to overcome the limitations and inadequacies inevitably posed by a fully mechanical system. The prototype development is approached in a theoretical manner beginning with the conceptualization and design of a rotating disk with a notches and corresponding closure surfaces to open and close the flow path. The actuated disk and notch design is then refined and followed by the design of an inlet and exhaust manifold to correspond to the valve design and the theorizing and design of a sealing gasket. The rotating speed of the valve is determined by a general idling speed and can be varied to provide variable valve timing with the motor. The final assembly eliminates a majority of the moving parts currently used in camshaft systems like the <b>cam</b> camshaft rocker <b>arm</b> push rod and springs and results in a significantly lighter valve actuation system. By eliminating the translatory motion of valves the problem of valves slamming on the valve seats at high velocities is eliminated thus greatly reducing engine wear...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the design and {{manufacturing}} of a mechanical variable valve actuation system, developed {{as part of the}} MUR financed research project concerning the realization of a high performance motorcycle engine, through a partnership of Moto Morini S. P. A. (BO), Dell’Orto S. P. A. (MI), Istituto Motori - CNR (NA), and DIME - Università di Napoli Federico II. After a synthetic description of the main variable valve actuation methods currently employed (timing, duration and lift variation, cyclic cylinder deactivation), the paper presents the results of our mechanical variable valve actuation system, consisting of three main elements: <b>cam,</b> main rocker <b>arm</b> with fixed fulcrum and secondary rocker arm with mobile fulcrum. It enables valve lift variation through a simple translation of the intermediate element (system 1). The study has been conducted implementing a numerical procedure specifically designed to determine cam profile and the kinematic and dynamic characteristics of the whole system, starting from the following input data: rocker arm geometry, relative positions and inertial data of elements, spring stiffness and preloading, camshaft speed and valve lift law. The model has been validated against the conventional timing system using kinematic simulations. Results of the numerical procedure verify the validity of the variable valve actuation system, capable of a valve lift variation from 30 % to 100 % of the maximum lift, with a limited acceleration (lower than maximum values). Based on the numerical results, we are developing a new mechanical variable valve actuation system. The new system consists of the same three elements used previously, but they are connected in a different way (system 2). The newer system enables more general lift profile distributions with a similar geometric complexity. A maximum closing limited to 30 % does not enable cyclic deactivation of some cylinders (strategy feasible on multicylinder engines) or exclusion of one or more valves (strategy feasible on multivalve engines). The activity was extended to research for a new solution (always a mechanical system), capable to allow inlet valves complete closing and timing and duration variation (system 3). This paper reports results reachable with the simplest system 1. This new system gives better perspectives of use for a new two-wheel vehicle engine...|$|R
