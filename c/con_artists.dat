500|$|After the World War, {{according}} to Beldie, actor Iancovescu introduced impressions of Bogdan-Pitești to his cabaret routine. It showed the convicted Garmanophile and an unnamed German official, who {{looked into the}} mislanding of propaganda funds on supporting petty [...] "henchmen". To this charge, the fictional Bogdan-Pitești replies: [...] "I have consumed your money, this much is true, but I did not pull one on you! For {{how is it that}} you could imagine me, a traitor of my country, not also being a con artist?" [...] According to Beldie, the account has a grain of truth: instead of using money to revive the Germanophile cause, Bogdan-Pitești directed them into his art collection. A somewhat similar version of this urban legend is included in the memoirs of a National Liberal adversary, I. G. Duca, who sees Bogdan-Pitești's retort as a paradoxical sign of injured patriotism: [...] "Did you perhaps think that you might buy off some of Romania's honest people? You would be dead wrong, in this land one can only buy off the <b>con</b> <b>artists,</b> only <b>con</b> <b>artists</b> such as myself." [...] Duca concludes: [...] "this reply, with its admirable and atavistic national dignity, tempts me to forget, though not to forgive, the utter turpitude that we call Bogdan-Pitești's life." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Exposé" [...] was {{the fourteenth}} {{episode of the}} series {{directed}} by Stephen Williams, and the ninth written by the screenwriting duo Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. Kitsis and Horowitz intended to make the episode an homage to film noir, with two <b>con</b> <b>artists</b> who did the [...] "perfect crime", that eventually goes wrong due to them getting stranded on the island. A reference to the genre was added by having Sawyer read Agatha Christie's Evil Under the Sun. A recurring theme is Nikki and Paulo's selfishness, which eventually leads to their deaths due to them being greedy and [...] "too focused on their own petty needs to really care about anyone else".|$|E

500|$|As the PCR, {{which was}} growing more {{influential}} (with {{the backing of}} Soviet occupation) while generally lacking popular appeal, sought to form alliances with various forces {{in order to increase}} its backing, Tătărescu declared his group to be left-wing and Social liberal, while attempting to preserve a middle course in the new political setting, by pleading for close relations to be maintained with both the Soviet Union and the Western Allies. N. D. Cocea, a prominent socialist who had joined the PNL, represented the faction in talks for an alliance with the Communists. The agreement, favored by Ana Pauker, was vehemently opposed by another member of the Communist leadership, Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu, who argued in favor of [...] "making a distinction inside the bourgeoisie", and collaborating with the main PNL, while calling Tătărescu's faction [...] "a gang of <b>con</b> <b>artists,</b> blackmailers, and well-known bribers".|$|E
500|$|Bogdan-Pitești's renewed his {{attacks on}} the Orthodox Church. Paul Cernat sees them as efforts to {{fabricate}} a religious alternative to the Orthodox mainstream, included in the larger phenomenon that was Symbolist cosmopolitanism. However, Galaction, who was to end his life as an Orthodox priest, recorded that the Știrbey-Vodă circle accommodated people of very diverse backgrounds. At one time, they included, alongside Galaction himself, the Roman Catholic priest Carol Auner, the Protestant sculptor Storck, and the anarchist activist Panait Mușoiu. According to Cernat, Bogdan-Pitești's bohemian society also grouped people believed associated with the illegal activities, and was noted for its [...] "libertine" [...] atmosphere. Galaction backed such interpretations, writing that the salon was also home to [...] "a dozen <b>con</b> <b>artists</b> and prostitutes." [...] The atmosphere was colloquial and free-spirited, {{to the point of}} being demeaning: story goes that the artists and writers were sometimes told licentious jokes, or had to endure grotesque farces.|$|E
500|$|Written as a frame story, Sub pecetea tainei {{comprises}} the recollections of Teodor [...] "Rache" [...] Ruse, a retired Police officer. Punctuated by willing omissions, for which rows of ellipses are employed, {{the text is}} structured into accounts of three unsolved cases: that of a missing person, the clerk Gogu Nicolau, {{who may or may}} not have been murdered by his wife; that of an epileptic minister whom Ruse is supposed to guard and who, after going missing and returning, presents his resignation and dies, leaving the general public clueless as to his fate; finally, that of a Viennese couple of <b>con</b> <b>artists</b> and presumed murderers (one of whom may be a transvestite woman) whose arrival in Bucharest poses a threat on the life of their female host, Lena Ceptureanu. Ruse's accounts, which oblique references in the text seem to place in 1930, form part of his conversations with the unnamed narrator, which are set in Caru cu bere restaurant and in the narrator's Bucharest home; this, Manolescu notes, echoes scenes in Craii.... A recurring element in the plot is the role played by secretive women, who may be directly or indirectly responsible for the deaths of male characters. Commentators have since attempted to match several of the protagonists with real people in Caragiale's life. Such theories identify Rache Ruse himself with Cantuniari, a policeman whom Caragiale had befriended, the minister with the leading Conservative Party member Alexandru Lahovary, and the female character Arethy with Miller Verghy.|$|E
