The current curing membrane evaluation method ASTM C 156, however, is incapable of distinguishing the <b>curing</b> <b>compound</b> quality and guiding the curing practice in the field. A new laboratory curing membrane evaluation protocol is developed in this study. It {{has the ability to}} rank the quality of <b>curing</b> <b>compound</b> and guide <b>curing</b> practice in the field according to the field ambient weather conditions and the type of <b>curing</b> <b>compound.</b> A series of field tests were conducted to investigate the key factors that affect the curing effectiveness in the field conditions. A finite element program, temperature and moisture analysis for curing concrete (TMAC 2), is updated to solve the coupled and nonlinear heat transfer and moisture transport problems in early-age concrete. Moisture capacity is induced into the TMAC 2, which makes it unique to characterize the self-desiccation. A full scale concrete pavement test study was conducted at the FAA National Airport Pavement Test Facility (NAPTF) near Atlantic City, New Jersey. In this study, the material properties, i. e. thermal conductivity and moisture diffusivity, were backcalculated from field data. Thereafter, backcalculated material properties were used to forward-calculate the temperature and moisture histories of all other sections. High order shear deformable theory is used to model the concrete slab curling and warping behavior because of highly nonlinear temperature and moisture gradients. The maximum shear strain is obtained a couple of inches below the concrete slab. This might account for the occurrence of delamination...|$|R
30|$|Besides the <b>curing</b> <b>compound,</b> {{also the}} storage and curing {{conditions}} of the concrete play a role, although {{to a lesser extent}} compared to the former. The effect is most pronounced in the case of absence of a <b>curing</b> <b>compound,</b> where {{it can be seen that}} more humid conditions have an adverse effect on the photocatalytic efficiency. This is related to the relative humidity conditions at the surface of the concrete and the competition effect between water and pollutants as described above. Moreover, the hardening process of the concrete will slightly differ depending on the curing conditions which could in turn affect the porosity of the surface and hence, also the photocatalytic action. This could be important in practice, because it is obviously hard to control these hardening conditions in situ.|$|R

Application of a liquid membrane-forming curing compound is among the most widely used curing methods for concrete pavements and bridge decks. <b>Curing</b> <b>compounds</b> are economical, easy to apply, and maintenance free. However, limited research has been done to investigate the effectiveness of different <b>curing</b> <b>compounds</b> and their application technologies. No reliable standard testing method is available {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} curing, especially of the field concrete curing. The present research investigates the effects of curing compound materials and application technologies on concrete properties, especially on the properties of surface concrete. This report presents a literature review of curing technology, with an emphasis on <b>curing</b> <b>compounds,</b> and the experimental results from the first part of this research—lab investigation. In the lab investigation, three <b>curing</b> <b>compounds</b> were selected and applied to mortar specimens at three different times after casting. Two application methods, single- and double-layer applications, were employed. Moisture content, conductivity, sorptivity, and degree of hydration were measured at different depths of the specimens. Flexural and compressive strength of the specimens were also tested. Statistical analysis was conducted to examine the relationships between these material properties. The research results indicate that application of a curing compound significantly increased moisture content and degree of cement hydration and reduced sorptivity of the near-surface-area concrete. For given concrete materials and mix proportions, optimal application time of <b>curing</b> <b>compounds</b> depended primarily upon the weather condition. If a sufficient amount of a high-efficiency-index curing compound was uniformly applied, no double-layer application was necessary. Among all test methods applied, the sorptivity test is the most sensitive one to provide good indication for the subtle changes in microstructure of the near-surface-area concrete caused by different curing materials and application methods. Sorptivity measurement has a close relation with moisture content and degree of hydration.

40|$|Curing is {{the process}} of {{controlling}} the rate and extent of moisture loss from the surface of cement based materials. It is the final stage in the production of cement-based materials and it is the essential part for achieving continuous hydration of cement, while avoiding cracking due to drying shrinkage.

Thus, a properly cured cement-based material is prepared for a long service life. Using environmentally friendly, water based bio-polymers could help to achieve more durable cement-based materials, and, therefore preventing a premature end of service life of building materials.

40|$|Abstract: Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) {{is highly}} {{workable}} concrete with high strength and high performance that can flow {{under its own}} weight through restricted sections without segregation and bleeding. SCC is achieved by reducing the volume ratio of aggregate to cementitious materials, increasing the paste volume and using various viscosity enhancing admixtures and superplasticizers. It is observed that the behaviour of the design concrete mix is significantly affected by variation in humidity and temperature both in fresh and hardened state. In this paper effect of three non-water-based curing techniques on mechanical properties such as compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength and shear strength of M 30 grade self-compacting concrete (SCC) is discussed. For compressive strength {{it is observed that}} immersion method for curing gives maximum compressive strength while the lowest compressive strength is for no curing. Polyethylene film curing gives second highest strength at 28 days. Similarly for split tensile strength, flexural strength & shear strength, the maximum strength is also with immersion method of curing. For split tensile strength <b>curing</b> <b>compound</b> gives almost at par with immersion method while no curing has least strength. Polyethylene film curing gives good results for flexural strength. For shear strength Polyethylene film gives about 82 % of immersion strength.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringKyle RidingConcrete is {{the most}} widely used {{construction}} material. Concrete strength and durability develop from a series of exothermic reactions involving water called hydration. Long-term durability and performance of concrete is very much dependent on the early hydration behavior of cementitious materials. This study examined the effects of curing temperature and access to moisture on the early age reaction rate of cementitious materials, and methods for quantifying these effects. Apparent activation energy (Ea) relates the effects of temperature on the cement hydration reaction. There are various methods and calculation techniques for estimating Ea that result in greatly varying values. Cement paste and mortar are often used to calculate Ea and used later for concrete. Ea values were calculated using cement mortar and paste by isothermal calorimetry and showed excellent correlation. This validates the use of Ea based on cement paste in modeling concrete behavior. Ea values were also calculated by chemical shrinkage and it showed potential for use in calculating Ea. Cementitious materials need free water to be available for hydration to continue. Curing with either waxy <b>curing</b> <b>compounds</b> or ponded water are common practices. The thickness of distilled water, lime-saturated water, and cement pore water used as a curing method affects the rate of hydration. Water-cementitious material ratio (w/cm) and sample depth affect the performance of water curing, with low w/cm being the most significant. Partial replacement of sand by fine lightweight aggregate also improves the hydration of cementitious material much more than conventional water ponding. <b>Curing</b> <b>compounds</b> showed improvements in cement hydration compared to uncured samples...|$|E
40|$|Concrete curing is of {{paramount}} importance in order for concrete to meet performance requirements. Conventionally, curing has been conducted by means of water sparkling, wet burlap or a <b>curing</b> <b>compound.</b> For performance and environmental reasons, internal curing has been gaining increased attention. However, more data is needed for the effectiveness of this curing technique when used in various concrete mixtures. This investigation addresses potential utilization of internal curing in high performance concrete (HPC). Internal curing was introduced by means of three aggregates: perlite, pumice and recycled aggregates; all of which were incorporated into HPC mixtures. Conventional mixtures were prepared and were thoroughly cured either by water or by a <b>curing</b> <b>compound</b> or left non-cured. Fresh concrete and Hardened concrete properties were assessed including slump, unit weight, compressive and flexural strength, and durability tests such as shrinkage assessment, rapid chloride permeability test (RCPT) and abrasion resistance. Experimental work is backed up with a simplified feasibility analysis with case study, incorporating initial and future costs to better judge potential of this technique. The outcome of this study uncovers that the addition of pre-wetted lightweight aggregates can prompt an enhancement in concrete workability and durability accompanied by a reduced shrinkage.

However, the present standard test, ASTM C 156 - 98, ?Standard Test Method of Water Retention by Concrete Curing Materials? has some inherent limitations in assessing the curing effectiveness of concrete. To better apply curing practices and qualify the curing compound, a new evaluation protocol is introduced in this study. The new protocol consists of using measured relative humidity and temperature to calculate an effectiveness index (EI) which serves as an indicator of the effectiveness of curing. Moistures loss and surface abrasion resistance measurements were made on concrete specimen, and were found to have significant correlation with EI, where higher EI were associated with lower moisture loss and higher surface abrasion resistance. EI was also found to be sensitive to ambient wind condition, types of curing compound and the application rate of the curing compound. Dielectric constant (DC) measurements were also made on concrete specimens indicating the free moisture content on the surface concrete.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{deterioration}} of concrete in South Africa is becoming of major {{concern to the}} construction industry. The maintenance of reinforced concrete structures is an extremely expensive exercise and is a continuing necessity. Concrete curing is a practice that is understood to be a necessity within industry, but is often overlooked {{as a result of}} time and/or economic constraints. The objective of the study is to ascertain whether or not the implementation of better quality and alternative curing techniques will improve the durability properties of the concrete. Curing is defined as the maintenance of appropriate moisture and temperature conditions to permit the continuation of the hydration or pozzolanic reaction. The objective of curing is to ensure the progress of hydration reactions causing the filling and discontinuity of capillary voids by hydrated compounds in newly placed concrete. Modern curing methods are generally classified as wet or sealing. Wet methods include fogging, sprinkling, ponding, immersion and wet coverings. Sealing methods include plastic coverings and membrane forming <b>curing</b> <b>compounds.</b> Crystallising permeability reducing admixtures may be included in the concrete mix design in order to decrease the penetrability of concrete by decreasing the interconnectivity of the pore structure. Curing methods need to be employed in order to assure specified durability limits are acquired, as durability constraints are implemented in industry. Various methods of curing were tested in order to establish the effect of the techniques on the durability properties of concrete. Samples were placed in water and in winter (Western Cape, South Africa) and simulated summer environments. Various curing techniques were then employed within each of the exposure environments. The curing methods were damp hessian, cling wrap, two <b>curing</b> <b>compounds</b> and two crystallising permeability reducers (PRA's). Samples were also left untreated in each environment as reference samples. Compressive strength, oxygen permeability, water sorptivity, chloride conductivity, bulk diffusion and accelerated carbonation tests were conducted. The results obtained in the study concur with those presented in literature. Prolonged periods of moist curing are significantly beneficial to the compressive strength and durability properties of concrete, however, full water immersion is not a feasible alternative for large or insitu-cast concrete elements. Results of the study show that d amp hessian was the best method to ensure superior durability properties. The sealing of samples with <b>curing</b> <b>compounds</b> in a cool and wet environment (winter) is not recommended, whereas it is marginally beneficial, as was clingwrap, in a hot and dry environment (summer).

Curing water amount, curing water ionic concentration, and sample thickness were varied. Finally, curing application timing was studied by comparing strength development of concrete cylinders sealed, placed in a moist room after 24 hours sealed, and immersed in a water bath immediately after finishing. Increasing the height of curing water decreased the height of heat of hydration rate peaks. Curing water ionic concentration affected the setting time and heat of hydration rate peak heights. Strength results show delayed curing can result in significant strength loss {{because of the difficulty}} for water to penetrate the already-hardened concrete...|$|R
30|$|The {{translation}} {{from the}} laboratory {{results to the}} “real” site efficiency is still a difficult factor, because of the great number of parameters involved. Hence, {{there is still a}} need for large scale projects to demonstrate the effectiveness of photocatalytic materials on site, including also other positive effects (O 3, VOC’s, PM…). To this purpose, two recent applications have also been started up in Belgium, which show already some very promising results. Here, the influence of several parameters (<b>curing</b> <b>compound,</b> surface finish, weathering conditions) affecting the photocatalytic activity in a practical case of road construction has been assessed to guarantee an optimal implementation. Furthermore, the best results will be achieved by modeling the environment, validating the model by measurements and implementing the different parameters to asses the real life effect (e.g. [18]). One must bear in mind that photocatalytic applications are only effective in case of good contact between pollutants and the active surface. Parameters as wind, street configuration and pollution source play an important role.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} the synthesis and characterization of epoxy resins based on (hexafluoroisopropylidene) diphenol (EFN) and p,p&# 8217;-isopropylidenebisphenol (EBN), respectively and 4, 4 &# 8217;- (hexafluoroisopropylidene) dipthalic-imideamine (IMAM), a curing agent. The synthesized epoxy resins and IMAM curing agent {{were characterized by}} Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and 1 H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. 13 C NMR technique was also used to characterize IMAM. Study of curing behavior of EFN and EBN with stoichiometric amount of aromatic 4, 4 &# 8217;-diaminodiphenylmethane (DDM), 4, 4 &# 8217;-diaminodiphenylsulfone (DDS) and IMAM by using Differential Scanning Calorimetery (DSC) indicated that IMAM was least reactive curing agent towards both epoxy resins as compared to DDS and DDM. The investigation of thermal decomposition of the <b>cured</b> <b>compounds</b> by thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) indicated the higher thermal stability of EFN and EBN resins initially with DDS and at elevated temperatures with IMAM. It was also observed that EFN resins were thermally more stable than EBN resins cured with corresponding curing agents...|$|R
