40|$|Rinderpest, {{also known}} as cattle plague, is a {{contagious}} viral disease affecting <b>clovenhoofed</b> animals mainly cattle and buffalo. Rinderpest {{is caused by a}} virus of the family Paramyxoviridae, genus Morbillivirus. Many species of wild and domestic cloven-hoofed animals including sheep and goats, show milder symptoms of the disease when infected, but the mortality rate can reach up to 100 per cent in highly susceptible cattle or buffalo herds. The OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code contains detailed recommendations on prevention and control of rinderpest. Rinderpest was one of the diseases for which the OIE established procedures of official recognition of the sanitary status of countries and zones. Rinderpest is a listed disease in the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Terrestrial Animal Health Code and must be reported to the OIE (OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code). 1 General Disease Information Sheets Where is the disease found?

40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{contagious}} animal viruses, causing a devastating disease in <b>clovenhoofed</b> animals with enormous economic consequences. Identification of the different parameters involved in the immune response elicited against FMDV remains unclear, and it is fundamental the understanding of such parameters before effective control measures can be put in place. In the present study, we show that interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) production by dendritic cells (DCs) is drastically increased during acute infection with FMDV in swine. In vitro blockade of IL- 10 with a neutralizing antibody against porcine IL- 10 restores T cell activation by DCs. Additionally, we describe that FMDV infects DC precursors and interferes with DC maturation and antigen presentation capacity. Thus, we propose a new mechanism of virus immunity in which a non-persistent virus, FMDV, induces immunosuppression by an increment in the production of IL- 10, which in turn, reduces T cell function. This reduction of T cell activity may result in a more potent induction of neutralizing antibody responses, clearing the viral infection.
