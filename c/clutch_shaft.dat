In the 1912 Indianapolis 500 {{he served as a}} relief driver for Joe Dawson from lap 108 to 144. Afterwards, Dawson {{returned}} to the car and drove on to victory. Unlike the 1924 race where both the starting and relief driver are listed as co-winners, Herr is not credited as an Indianapolis 500 winner because Dawson both started and finished the race. Herr drove his own car in the 1913 Indianapolis 500 and started fifth and completed only seven laps before being knocked out by a broken <b>clutch</b> <b>shaft,</b> driving a Wisconsin powered Stutz. It would be his last Championship Car start.|$|E
5000|$|A revised 15 hp {{model was}} {{introduced}} in 1911 dropping the monobloc engine and reverting to Austin's usual individually cast cylinders side-valve T-head engine design but an increased stroke of 4.5 in gave a capacity of 2838 cc [...] With the same bore it remained rated at 19.6 hp. Austin manufactured 688 of these more powerful cars. It had a four-speed gearbox with cone <b>clutch,</b> <b>shaft</b> and bevel-drive back axle. Suspension was provided by semi-elliptic leaf springs at the front and Austin-patent full-elliptic leaf springs at the rear. Brakes were by rear wheel drum and transmission brakes. The wheels were wooden artillery style wheels with Michelin detachable rims, 815 x 105 beaded-edge tyres. In 1913, a powered chassis with tyres was available for £350.|$|E

40|$|The present Master´s thesis {{deals with}} the concept of press drive of Blanking press LKDS 800 used for {{blanking}} in automatic blanking line. The first part of the thesis is dedicated to the individual arrangements of press drives and servo press drives and to the description of main components.

From these solutions, the option with the lowest drive height is selected. This option, offers the computation of the main drive, flywheel, spur gearing and clutch/brake combination.

40|$|Dynamic {{simulations}} {{and experimental}} validation tests {{were performed on}} a two-stage, two-speed gearbox {{as part of the}} drive system research activities of the NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Subsonics Rotary Wing Project. The gearbox was driven by two electromagnetic motors and had two electromagnetic, multi-disk clutches to control output speed. A dynamic model of the system was created which included a direct current electric motor with proportional-integral-derivative (PID) speed control, a two-speed gearbox with dual electromagnetically actuated clutches, and an eddy current dynamometer. A six degree-of-freedom model of the gearbox accounted for the system torsional dynamics and included gear, <b>clutch,</b> <b>shaft,</b> and load inertias as well as shaft flexibilities and a dry clutch stick-slip friction model. Experimental validation tests were performed on the gearbox in the NASA Glenn gear noise test facility. Gearbox output speed and torque as well as drive motor speed and current were compared to those from the analytical predictions. The experiments correlate very well with the predictions, thus validating the dynamic simulation methodologies...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{innovative}} multi-gap magnetorheological clutch is described. It {{is inspired by}} a device previously developed by the author’s research group and contains a novel solution based on electrodynamic effects, capable to considerably improve the transmissible torque during the engagement phase. Since this (transient) phase {{is characterized by a}} non-zero angular speed between the two <b>clutch</b> <b>shafts,</b> the rotation of a permanent magnets system, used to excite the fluid, induces eddy currents on some conductive material strategically positioned in the device. As a consequence, an electromagnetic torque is produced which is added to the torque transmitted by the magnetorheological fluid only. Once the clutch is completely engaged and the relative speed between the two shafts is zero, the electrodynamic effects vanish and the device operates like a conventional magnetorheological clutch. The system is investigated and designed by means a 3 D FEM model and the performance of the device is experimentally validated on a prototype...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an electrodynamic/ magnetorheological fluid-based clutch activated using permanent magnets attached to one shaft. During the electromechanical transient phase, {{when the two}} <b>clutch</b> <b>shafts</b> rotate at different speed, the Permanent Magnets (PMs) induce eddy currents on some conductive materials strategically placed in the system. The interaction between these currents and the magnetic induction produces an electromagnetic torque which is added {{to that of the}} Magneto-Rheological Fluid (MRF), helping the clutch engagement in the start up phase when an extra torque is necessary to overcome possible static frictions. Once the two shafts have reached the same speed, the eddy currents (and consequently the electromagnetic torque) vanish and the torque transmission is assured by the MRF only. The conductive material is arranged as a copper sheet and the performance of the device is investigated. The proposed clutch is analyzed using a 3 -D finite-element code which takes into account the B-H curve of the nonlinear materials (e. g. MRF, Permanent Magnets and ferromagnetic materials) and the movement of the different parts. Finally, in order to verify the FEM model, some experimental measurements are performed on a prototype...|$|R
