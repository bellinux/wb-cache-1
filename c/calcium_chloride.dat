5|$|Sodium is now {{produced}} commercially {{through the}} electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, {{based on a}} process patented in 1924. This is done in a Downs cell in which the NaCl is mixed with <b>calcium</b> <b>chloride</b> to lower the melting point below 700°C. As calcium is less electropositive than sodium, no calcium will be deposited at the cathode. This method is less expensive than the previous Castner process (the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide).|$|E

5|$|Exposure may not {{be evident}} for eight hours for 50% HF, rising to 24 hours for lower concentrations, and a burn may {{initially}} be painless as hydrogen fluoride affects nerve function. If skin has been exposed to HF, damage can be reduced by rinsing it under a jet of water for 10–15 minutes and removing contaminated clothing. Calcium gluconate is often applied next, providing calcium ions to bind with fluoride; skin burns can be treated with 2.5% calcium gluconate gel or special rinsing solutions. Hydrofluoric acid absorption requires further medical treatment; calcium gluconate may be injected or administered intravenously. Using <b>calcium</b> <b>chloride</b> – a common laboratory reagent – in lieu of calcium gluconate is contraindicated, and may lead to severe complications. Excision or amputation of affected parts may be required.|$|E
5|$|The major {{producers}} of calcium are China (about 10000 to 12000 tonnes per year), Russia (about 6000 to 8000 tonnes per year), and the United States (about 2000 to 4000 tonnes per year). Canada and France are {{also among the}} minor producers. In 2005, about 24000 tonnes of calcium were produced; {{about half of the}} world's extracted calcium is used by the United States, with about 80% of the output used each year. In Russia and China, Davy's method of electrolysis is still used, but is instead applied to molten <b>calcium</b> <b>chloride.</b> Since calcium is less reactive than strontium or barium, the oxide–nitride coating that results in air is stable and lathe machining and other standard metallurgical techniques are suitable for calcium. In the United States and Canada, calcium is instead produced by reducing lime with aluminium metal at high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of pure alkali metals is somewhat complicated {{due to their}} extreme reactivity with commonly used substances, such as water. From their silicate ores, all the stable alkali metals may be obtained the same way: sulfuric acid is first used to dissolve the desired alkali metal ion and aluminium(III) ions from the ore (leaching), whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture by precipitating it as the hydroxide. The remaining insoluble alkali metal carbonate is then precipitated selectively; the salt is then dissolved in hydrochloric acid to produce the chloride. The result is then left to evaporate and the alkali metal can then be isolated. Lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides, with <b>calcium</b> <b>chloride</b> typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture. The heavier alkali metals, however, is more typically isolated in a different way, where a reducing agent (typically sodium for potassium and magnesium or calcium for the heaviest alkali metals) is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride. The liquid or gaseous product (the alkali metal) then undergoes fractional distillation for purification.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWet {{pretreatment}} {{is widely}} employed {{as the most}} economic method to treat {{municipal solid waste incineration}} (MSWI) fly ash. Meanwhile, much wastewater containing high concentration of chlorides generated during the wet process if the liquid-solid weight ratio was not appropriate. So measures were taken to control the dissolving amounts of <b>calcium</b> <b>chlorides</b> which contribute to the further reuse as basis with cement kiln and remove more chlorides like sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl) and so on which produce negative impact. In laboratory experiments, the water-washing process was applied to study the typical MSWI fly ash and investigate the optimal parameters. First, multi-step water-washing process was carried out and key parameters influencing the removal rate of chlorides were determined. Then, cyclic water-washing process was conducted to overcome defects {{on the basis of the}} former. In this experiment, calcium hydroxide as a cheap and easily got chemical was added to affect the ionic equilibrium and solubility equilibrium associated with calcium. When compared with the original fly ash, <b>calcium</b> <b>chlorides</b> remained in the treated fly ash won’t be a huge loss while other chlorides are greatly reduced. Combined with the demand for raw materials of low chlorine in cement production, it's potential for MSWI fly ash after wet treatment to be applied in cement kiln when this ash in the cement kiln is at a lower rate of substitution...|$|R

5|$|Samarium is {{not found}} free in nature, but, like other rare earth elements, is {{contained}} in many minerals, including monazite, bastnäsite, cerite, gadolinite and samarskite; monazite (in which samarium occurs at concentrations of up to 2.8%) and bastnäsite are mostly used as commercial sources. World resources of samarium are estimated at two million tonnes; they are mostly located in China, US, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia, and the annual production is about 700 tonnes. Country production reports are usually given for all rare-earth metals combined. By far, China has the largest production with 120,000 tonnes mined per year; it {{is followed by the}} US (about 5,000tonnes) and India (2,700tonnes). Samarium is usually sold as oxide, which at the price of about 30USD/kg is one of the cheapest lanthanide oxides. Whereas mischmetal – a mixture of rare earth metals containing about 1% of samarium – has long been used, relatively pure samarium has been isolated only recently, through ion exchange processes, solvent extraction techniques, and electrochemical deposition. The metal is often prepared by electrolysis of a molten mixture of samarium(III) chloride with sodium chloride or <b>calcium</b> <b>chloride.</b> Samarium can also be obtained by reducing its oxide with lanthanum.

40|$|Chewing slicks or Meswaks {{are used}} for teeth {{cleaning}} {{in many parts of}} the world. They contain substances that may reduce caries and periodontal disease. The present study consisted of 2 parts. In a short-term experiment, volunteers chewed on an inert eliciting agent (pyrogen-free rubber) and then a piece of Meswak, each for 5 min. For the medium-term experiment, votunreers brushed with either Meswak or a conventional toothbrush 5 x a day for 2 weeks. Saliva produced immediately after chewing Meswak showed statistically significant increases in <b>calcium</b> and <b>chloride,</b> but decreases in phosphate and pH as compared with controls. In the medium-term experiment, saliva samples collected 4 h after the last use of Meswak or toothbrush showed no significant differences in any of the components examined (<b>calcium,</b> magnesium, <b>chloride,</b> phosphate, IgA, IgG, lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate transaminase). Gingival and plaque indices, however, were significantly lower after brushing with Meswak. Salivary calcium promotes mineralization of tooth enamel and chloride inhibits calculus formation.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of an {{experimental}} study of aqueous corrosion of Fe-phosphide under conditions relevant to the early Earth. The results strongly suggest that iron meteorites were an important source of reactive phosphorus (P), a requirement for the formation of P-based life. We further demonstrate that iron meteorites were an abundant source of phosphide minerals early in Earth history. Phosphide corrosion was studied in five different solutions: deionized water, deionized water buffered with sodium bicarbonate, deionized water with dissolved magnesium and <b>calcium</b> <b>chlorides,</b> deionized water containing ethanol and acetic acid, and deionized water containing the chlorides, ethanol, and acetic acid. Experiments were performed in the presence of both air and pure Ar gas to evaluate the effect of atmospheric chemistry. Phosphide corrosion in deionized water results in a metastable mixture of mixed-valence, P-bearing ions including pyrophosphate and triphosphate, key components for metabolism in modern life. In a pH-buffered solution of NaHCO 3, the condensed and reduced species diphosphonate is an abundant corrosion product. Corrosion in ethanol- and acetic acid-containing solutions yields additional P-bearing organic molecules, including acetyl phosphonate and a cyclic triphosphorus molecule. Phosphonate is a major corrosion product of all experiments and is the only P-bearing molecule that persists in solutions with high concentrations of magnesium and <b>calcium</b> <b>chlorides,</b> which suggests that phosphonate may have been a primitive oceanic source of P. The stability and reactivity of phosphonate and hypophosphite in solution were investigated to elucidate reaction mechanisms and the role of mineral catalysts on P-solution chemistry.
