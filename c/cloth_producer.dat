50|$|The Industrial Revolution brought huge {{changes to}} cloth manufacturing. The rise of European {{colonialism}} {{at the same}} time helped support the rapid growth of cloth production by creating many cheap sources of raw materials. British cloth manufacturers would import raw cotton from America and the British West Indies to Ireland, where it would be spun into yarn. The yarn would be imported into England, where mechanized factories employed thousands of workers, who would weave cloth on industrial looms. In 1781, a <b>cloth</b> <b>producer</b> from Manchester testified about his business to a committee of the House of Commons in the British Parliament. He stated that he employed 6000 workers, who would print and stamp 60,000 yards of cotton and linen fabric a year. Cotton gradually replaced linen for most uses in clothing, but remained preferred for bedsheets and tablecloths. Other European countries manufactured and traded their own types of household linens as well, and mass manufacturing techniques and trade competition gradually made affordable household linens common.|$|E
50|$|Born in Dresden {{as the son}} of Christian Gottlob Fiedler, Adolf was one of {{the most}} {{important}} <b>cloth</b> <b>producers</b> of Saxony in the beginning of the 19th century. The operational seat of the company was in Oederan in Saxony. He also had factories in Kalisz and Opatówek (both in Poland), Wegefarth, Wingendorf, Falkenau and Berthelsdorf (all in Saxony). He followed other <b>cloth</b> <b>producers</b> to eastern regions at the time of the German industrial revolution because of lower salaries and large loans offered by the Polish government. The German investments in Poland were followed by experienced Saxon and Bohemian specialists to run the factories. An additional reason was local water power.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, {{the market for}} natural dyes in the fashion {{industry}} is experiencing a resurgence. Western consumers have become {{more concerned about the}} health and environmental impact of synthetic dyes in manufacturing and there is a growing demand for products that use natural dyes. The European Union, for example, has encouraged Indonesian batik <b>cloth</b> <b>producers</b> to switch to natural dyes to improve their export market in Europe.|$|R
50|$|This type {{of cloth}} came {{to being in}} the late 1960s and early 1970s and remains popular with {{tourists}} and urban Ivorians today. Eager to sustain Senufo traditions and help expand the local market, American Peace Corps volunteers encouraged the people to explore new means of clothing production. Fila cloth consisted of six stripes of cotton cloth that had been sewn together and served as the prototype for which korhogo was built upon. Fila is mostly decorated with hand painted stripes as its primary motif and zig-zag designs symbolic of the leopard. To preserve fila's traditional characteristics, Korhogo <b>cloth</b> <b>producers</b> continued to use hand spun cotton strips woven by their Dyula neighbors. However, unlike fila, Korhogo cloth quickly became the canvas onto which <b>cloth</b> <b>producers</b> painted a large variety of imagery derived from the local society and culture. The earliest examples of Korhogo cloth have fila strips which were used as the grid where visual motifs would be painted. When the Grahams had coveted the cloth by the early 1980s, the Senufo cloth makers had abandoned the strips and used the entire cloth to frame the painted motifs.|$|R
50|$|With the {{foundation}} of the big weaving mill by Adolf Gottlieb Fiedler, a Saxon industrialist, Opatówek started booming. Fiedler established one of the biggest weaving mills in the Kingdom of Poland in 1824-26. The government of Polish Kingdom created very good conditions for the development of industry. Adolf Gottlieb Fiedler received a big loan from the polish government to build the factory in Opatowek. Also in spite of lower salaries he followed other <b>cloth</b> <b>producers</b> to eastern regions {{at the time of the}} German industrial revolution. The German investments in Poland were followed by Saxon and bohemian specialists to run the factories. There they found cheap workers, water power and they brought in their knowhow. The factory of Opatówek employed 600 workers and the company won several international prizes with their products. The Opatówek factory was the cash cow of Fiedler's company. The town grew with great speed.|$|R

One of the most distinguished foreigners in Dubrovnik was the pharmacist Monaldo Viganti whose activity, based on published and unpublished materials in the Dubrovnik Archives, shown in this -paper from 30 - 80 s of the 15 th century. In addition to running pharmacy, he especially excelled in managing loan services by financing -Dubrovnik <b>cloth</b> <b>producers</b> and merchants. Viganti was a full citizen of Dubrovnik and afterwards Antunini, he intensively traded on the Apenine Peninsula and inside the Balkans. He often did business associated with other merchants. After his arrival in Dubrovnik his closest collaborator was Paolo Tomazi, pharmacist married to Viganti's sister. Later he became a member of numerous trade associations. He started his family in Dubrovnik and his heirs kept on his tradition and became prominent pharmacists in Dubrovnik. Monaldo was a link, which contributed, the prosperity of Dubrovnik and through trade activities connected Apenine and Balkan Peninsula...|$|R
50|$|He {{inherited}} only 10 villages {{after his}} father, but {{near the end}} of his life he was the owner of 114 villages, 6 towns and partial owner of another 21 villages and 3 towns. A member of Czech Brethren, he converted to Roman Catholicism {{near the end of}} his life, and in order to attract settlers to his lands he was a strong believer in religious tolerance. This is visible on the example of the town he founded, Swarzędz (early known as 'Grzymałowo'). In 1621 he invited Jews from large city of Poznań to the village of Swarzedz, guaranteeing them many religious freedoms, and sponsored the construction of 32 houses in the city for various craftsman. In 1638 he issued another set of guarantees, this time for Protestant settlers, invited Germans, and it was also the time that Swarzędz received city rights. Two years later the new town already had a wooden city hall. Early industries of the city, supported by Zygmunt, included a brewery, cloth manufacture, gunsmiths ('bractwo kurkowe') and shoemakers guilds, the latter received its own statue in 1644. By that time the town has already become one of the most important <b>cloth</b> <b>producers</b> in Wielkopolska region of the Commonwealth.|$|R
40|$|This paper, a much {{revised version}} of an earlier paper (with {{different}} tables), seeks to explain why Spanish merino wools arrived so late in the Low Countries, only from the 1420 s, why initially only those <b>cloth</b> <b>producers</b> known as the nouvelles draperies chose to use them, and why their resort to such merino wools allowed {{at least some of}} them to escape the current crisis afflicting the traditional 'old draperies', and indeed to expand to become the chief <b>producers</b> of woollen <b>cloths</b> in the southern Low Countries during the later fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Although the merino have been by far the world’s finest wools, since at least the seventeenth century, English wools had enjoyed that supremacy in the medieval era. The Spanish sheep breeds that produced the first merino wools did not emerge until or after the 1340 s; and it took many decades of experimental breeding and improved flock management to produce better quality wools in sufficient quantities for export (first to Italy). Before the introduction of merinos, the indigenous Spanish sheep had produced some of the worst wools in Europe. In the thirteenth century, they were used only in making very cheap, coarse, light cloths, when north-west Europe was producing a wide range of textiles, from such coarse light generally worsted-style fabrics to the most luxurious woollens. For reasons that I have elaborated elsewhere, the onset of a spreading stain of chronic and debilitating wars, from the 1290 s, throughout the Mediterranean basin and north-west Europe, resulted in a sharp rise in transaction costs that made long-distance trade in cheaper textiles unprofitable. Consequently, by the 1330 s, most north-west European draperies had abandoned export-oriented production of cheaper line textiles to concentrate on very high priced luxury woollens, those that could so much better 'bear the freight'. Furthermore, in Flanders, a considerable number of small-town and village producers engaged in precisely the same industrial re-orientation; but in producing genuine heavy weight woollens, they sought to imitate those of the large Flemish towns; and, in selling their cloths at lower prices, came to be known as the nouvelles draperies. This industrial reorientation meant that <b>cloth</b> <b>producers</b> in the Low Countries became all the more reliant on English wools, above all the traditional urban draperies (who came to use such wools exclusively). The English crown was quick to exploit this dependency by sharply raising export taxes, which, by the 1390 s, constituted half of the sales price; and that in turn accounted for up to 70 percent of production costs in the Low Countries' urban draperies. Meanwhile, English cloth exports, very lightly taxed, gained an enormous cost and thus price advantage, but one not fully exploited until the fifteenth century. The catalyst for the final economic crisis, one that brought about the irredeemable decline of most of the urban draperies in the Low Countries, and the expansion of the nouvelles draperies, took place from 1429 to 1473, when the English crown sought to exploit the wool trade even further, in pursuing ill-advised bullionist policies: by requiring that the Calais Staple wool cartel sharply raise prices, that it seel all wools only for 'ready English money' without credit, and that it deliver one third of the sales receipts to the mint in gold bullion. Not until the 1470 s did the Burgundians succeed in having these bullionist ordinances revoked. Meanwhile the traditional Flemish and Brabantine draperies, in continuing to use such high-cost English wools exclusively, for fear of losing customers, ensured their own rapid decline, indeed losing markets to both the English cloth trade and the nouvelles draperies, who also acquired considerable capital and labour from the declining draperies. Their success, as less quality-conscious imitators, lay in their willingness to use the far cheaper but now improved Spanish wools. An historic prejudice against pre-merino Spanish wools probably explains whey even they had not used these wools before the onset of this crisis. Having displaced the traditional draperies, the nouvelles draperies reached their apogee in the 1540 s, when they were superseded by the sayetteries, after international market conditions had once more favoured longdistance trade in truly cheaper, light textiles. wool, cloth, woollen, worsteds, sheep-breeding and management, the Nouvelles Draperies, sayetteries, Old Draperies, industrial organization, taxation, fiscal policies, monetary policies, transaction costs, cartels, Calais Staple, England, Spain, Flanders, the Low Countries, the Mediterranean, the Hanseatic League. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} Africa's {{place in the}} world is negotiated in different forms of material engagement with Dutch Wax cloth [...] designing, advertising, selling, buying, and tailoring-along the cloth's trajectory between the Netherlands and Togo. Derived from a manual Javanese textile printing technique, Dutch Wax cloth has been machine-printed in the Netherlands since the late 19 th century, and was introduced to West Africa in the early 20 th century. Lomé, Togo was a hub for its distribution throughout West and Central Africa for much of the 20 th century. The cloth's visual and material attributes were historically developed through exchanges between West African consumers and European manufacturers and Dutch Wax has since been integrated into both dress practices and processes of social reproduction in Togo, as in much of West Africa. Further, in recent years, the <b>cloth's</b> <b>producer</b> has been rebranding itself from a textile manufacturer for Africa into a global luxury design and fashion brand. As such, Dutch Wax cloth has and continues to not only mediate but also embody West African participation in the global. By examining how Dutch Wax is "done" in various sites of practice along its path-how it is given form, and what is produced alongside these forms-this multi-sited ethnography brings to light how Africa's relationship to and place in the global is negotiated in the practices of designers, advertisers, sellers, buyers, and tailors across the Netherlands, Togo, and "the global. " I argue that the view of Africa-in-the-world (Ferguson 2006) that emerges in each of these sites of practice and across all five is one that is characterized by a tenuous play between absence and presence, visibility and invisibility, inclusion and exclusion. Even as it offers a seductive alternative to past discourses about a "hopeless," "crisis-ridden," "old Africa," the "New Africa" remains decidedly layered and multiple. by Amah Melissa Edoh.
