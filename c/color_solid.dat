2500|$|A {{description}} of color systems {{leading up to}} Munsell’s, and a biographical explanation of Munsell’s changing ideas about color and development of his <b>color</b> <b>solid,</b> {{leading up to the}} publication of A Color Notation in 1905.|$|E
2500|$|In the HSL [...] "bi-hexcone" [...] model, {{lightness}} {{is defined}} as the average of the largest and smallest color components (...) [...] This definition also puts the primary and secondary colors into a plane, but a plane passing halfway between white and black. The resulting <b>color</b> <b>solid</b> is a double-cone similar to Ostwald’s, shown above.|$|E
2500|$|Several earlier color order systems {{had placed}} colors into a {{three-dimensional}} <b>color</b> <b>solid</b> of {{one form or}} another, but Munsell {{was the first to}} separate hue, value, and chroma into perceptually uniform and independent dimensions, and {{he was the first to}} systematically illustrate the colors in three-dimensional space. [...] Munsell’s system, particularly the later renotations, is based on rigorous measurements of human subjects’ visual responses to color, putting it on a firm experimental scientific basis. [...] Because of this basis in human visual perception, Munsell’s system has outlasted its contemporary color models, and though it has been superseded for some uses by models such as CIELAB (L*a*b*) and CIECAM02, it is still in wide use today.|$|E

2500|$|The idea {{of using}} a {{three-dimensional}} <b>color</b> <b>solid</b> to represent all colors was developed during the 18th and 19th centuries. [...] Several different shapes for such a solid were proposed, including: a double triangular pyramid by Tobias Mayer in 1758, a single triangular pyramid by Johann Heinrich Lambert in 1772, a sphere by Philipp Otto Runge in 1810, a hemisphere by Michel Eugène Chevreul in 1839, a cone by Hermann von Helmholtz in 1860, a tilted cube by William Benson in 1868, and a slanted double cone by August Kirschmann in 1895. [...] These systems became progressively more sophisticated, with Kirschmann’s even recognizing the difference in value between bright colors of different hues. [...] But all of them remained either purely theoretical or encountered practical problems in accommodating all colors. [...] Furthermore, none was based on any rigorous scientific measurement of human vision; before Munsell, the relationship between hue, value, and chroma was not understood.|$|E
5000|$|Associated {{with each}} type of {{spectral}} power distribution, one and only one <b>color</b> <b>solid</b> can be constructed in a uniform color space. It has been proved that this <b>color</b> <b>solid</b> comprises all the object colors producible under illumination of that spectral power distribution with one unit luminous flux, and {{the volume of the}} <b>color</b> <b>solid</b> determines the upper limit for the number of the object colors producible under the given spectral power distribution with one unit luminous flux. This volume of the <b>color</b> <b>solid</b> associated with the spectral power distribution is called the color rendering capacity. It may be expressed as a proportion of the volume of the <b>color</b> <b>solid</b> associated with the equal energy spectrum, and is output in this form from computer software known as [...] "CRC99".|$|E
50|$|A <b>color</b> <b>solid</b> is the {{three-dimensional}} {{representation of a}} color model, an analog of the two-dimensional color wheel. The added spatial dimension allows a <b>color</b> <b>solid</b> to depict an added dimension of color variation. Whereas a two-dimensional color wheel typically depicts the variables of hue (red, green, blue, etc.) and brightness (gradations of light and dark), a <b>color</b> <b>solid</b> adds the variable of saturation, allowing the sphere to depict all conceivable colors in an organized three-dimensional structure.|$|E
