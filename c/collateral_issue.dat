I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the stem of the Usher race, all time-honoured as it was, had put forth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain. It was this deficiency, I considered, while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people, and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one, in the long lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other--it was this deficiency, perhaps, of <b>collateral</b> <b>issue,</b> and the consequent undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the [...] "House of Usher"--an appellation which seemed to include, {{in the minds of the}} peasantry who used it, both the family and the family mansion.|$|E

However, farmers in many countries are credit constrained, e. g. due to collateral reasons, which {{is the case in}} Central Europe and East Africa, among others.

However, current financial markets do not offer wage growth-linked securities and borrowing against labor income without collateral is difficult.

Steady state turning of a wheeled vehi-cle on natural terrain with slow but capable locomotors char-acteristic of planetary robotic vehicles is the scope of this research. Two tire designs were developed, implemented and evalu-ated aboard the Nomad robot, enabling a comparative study of their effect on mobility and steering.
