5|$|The American Red Cross set up {{operations}} at the Crum drugstore and {{took the lead in}} providing aid and <b>comfort</b> <b>to</b> the victims. The Lansing Red Cross headquarters stayed open until 11:30 that night to answer telephone calls, update the list of dead and injured, and provide information and planning services for the following day.|$|E
5|$|Time {{would prove}} Reid correct {{in most of}} his criticisms of Aberhart: he did lack a {{specific}} economic agenda, much of his legislation was struck down by the courts, and the depression did continue for several more years in Alberta. This was of cold <b>comfort</b> <b>to</b> Reid, whose defeat was total: at 408 days, his time as Premier was the shortest in the province's history to that point.|$|E
5|$|Alexios had {{anticipated}} {{help in the}} form of mercenary forces from the West, but he was totally unprepared for the immense and undisciplined force that soon arrived in Byzantine territory. It was no <b>comfort</b> <b>to</b> Alexios to learn that four of the eight leaders of {{the main body of the}} Crusade were Normans, among them Bohemund. Since the crusade had to pass through Constantinople, however, the Emperor had some control over it. He required its leaders to swear to restore to the empire any towns or territories they might reconquer from the Turks on their way to the Holy Land. In return, he gave them guides and a military escort.|$|E

5|$|The Empire of Nicaea, {{founded by}} the Laskarid dynasty, managed to reclaim Constantinople from the Latins in 1261 and defeat Epirus. This led to a {{short-lived}} revival of Byzantine fortunes under Michael VIII Palaiologos, but the war-ravaged Empire was ill-equipped {{to deal with the}} enemies that now surrounded it. To maintain his campaigns against the Latins, Michael pulled troops from Asia Minor and levied crippling taxes on the peasantry, causing much resentment. Massive construction projects were completed in Constantinople to repair the damage of the Fourth Crusade, but none of these initiatives was of any <b>comfort</b> <b>to</b> the farmers in Asia Minor suffering raids from Muslim ghazis.|$|E
5|$|The script {{calls for}} one actor to play both male {{characters}}Jason and the pimp. Jason and Number 18 are haunted by four voices. As poetic and prophetic voices, these characters serve {{much the same}} purpose as a chorus in Greek tragedies, according to reviewer Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate. Variously considered angels or ghosts, the voices are written in the script to be played by the female actors who portray Number 18, Marta, Ali, and Mama. While these voices sometimes emphasize {{the horrors of the}} sex industry, at other times, they offer <b>comfort</b> <b>to</b> Number 18. It is only revealed at the play's conclusion that the chorus is made up of dead child prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|The storyline {{continued}} to play out over the following months as Ruth had her mastectomy operation, began a slow process of recovery and came to terms with her new appearance. When Ruth's chemotherapy treatment began during the Autumn months, David, Heather and close friend Usha (Souad Faress) were {{a constant source of}} support and <b>comfort</b> <b>to</b> her. Following her last course of chemotherapy, Ruth returned to work on the farm and was later given the all clear. In 2002, Ruth became pregnant and gave birth to her third child, Ben (Thomas Lester).|$|E

5|$|Alexandra {{spent the}} spring of 1877 in Greece recuperating from a period of ill health and visiting her brother King George of Greece. During the Russo-Turkish War, Alexandra was clearly partial against Turkey and towards Russia, where her sister was married to the Tsarevitch, and she lobbied for a {{revision}} of the border between Greece and Turkey in favour of the Greeks. Alexandra and her two sons spent {{the next three years}} largely parted from each other's company as the boys were sent on a worldwide cruise as part of their naval and general education. The farewell was very tearful and, as shown by her regular letters, she missed them dreadfully. In 1881, Alexandra and Albert Edward travelled to Saint Petersburg after the assassination of Alexander II of Russia, both to represent Britain and so that Alexandra could provide <b>comfort</b> <b>to</b> her sister, who was now the Tsarina.|$|E
5|$|As World War II neared its conclusion, Kimball {{and other}} LDS Church leaders {{constantly}} {{responded to the}} needs of the friends and families of LDS war casualties. Kimball's eldest son, Spence, was nearly killed in 1945 while serving aboard the aircraft carrier USS Franklin, when bombs dropped from Japanese airplanes damaged the ship and ignited its tanks of aviation fuel. In an attempt to give <b>comfort</b> <b>to</b> families of those killed in combat, Kimball drafted a well-known letter in which he wrote that sin, not premature death, was the only true tragedy in life. Kimball compared the death of young servicemen to the early death of Jesus Christ and stated that although such death is heartbreaking, from an eternal perspective, God's all-knowing purposes would be seen in their circumstances.|$|E
5|$|My lords, the law {{of nature}} moves me to sorrow for my sister; the burden that is fallen upon me makes me amazed, and yet, {{considering}} I am God's creature, ordained to obey His appointment, I will thereto yield, desiring {{from the bottom of}} my heart that I may have assistance of His grace to be the minister of His heavenly will in this office now committed to me. And as I am but one body naturally considered, though by His permission a body politic to govern, so shall I desire you all... to be assistant to me, that I with my ruling and you with your service may make a good account to Almighty God and leave some <b>comfort</b> <b>to</b> our posterity on earth. I mean to direct all my actions by good advice and counsel.|$|E

5|$|Other {{members of}} the royal family were {{similarly}} involved. Prince Albert, Duke of York (later George VI), was commissioned in the Royal Navy and saw action as a turret officer aboard HMS Collingwood at the battle of Jutland but saw no further action in the war, largely because of ill health. Princess Mary, the King's only daughter, visited hospitals and welfare organisations with her mother, assisting with projects to give <b>comfort</b> <b>to</b> British servicemen and assistance to their families. One of these projects was Princess Mary's Christmas Gift Fund, through which £162,000 worth of gifts was sent to all British soldiers and sailors for Christmas 1914. She took an active role in promoting the Girl Guide movement, the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD), the Land Girls and in 1918, she took a nursing course and went to work at Great Ormond Street Hospital.|$|E
5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great <b>comfort</b> <b>to</b> me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me {{from time to time in}} my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E
5|$|The convoys {{of wounded}} were met {{a few miles}} from El Arish by {{infantry}} with sandcarts lent by the 52nd (Lowland) Division, so the wounded who had endured the cacolets travelled in <b>comfort</b> <b>to</b> the receiving station, arriving at 04:00 on 25 December. The 52nd (Lowland) Division supplied medical stores and personnel to assist, but although arrangements were made for evacuation to the railhead two days later, evacuation by sea was planned. This had to be postponed due to a gale with rain and hail on 27 December and it was not until 29 December that the largest single ambulance convoy organised in the campaign, 77 sandcarts, nine sledges and a number of cacolet camels, moved out in three lines along the beach with 150 wounded. A few serious cases, who had not been ready to be moved, were evacuated the following day to begin their journey to Kantara on the Suez Canal.|$|E

5|$|The limited {{scope of}} the Instruments of Accession {{and the promise of}} a wide-ranging {{autonomy}} and the other guarantees they offered, gave sufficient <b>comfort</b> <b>to</b> many rulers, who saw this as the best deal they could strike given the lack of support from the British, and popular internal pressures. Between May 1947 and the transfer of power on 15 August 1947, the vast majority of states signed Instruments of Accession. A few, however, held out. Some simply delayed signing the Instrument of Accession. Piploda, a small state in central India, did not accede until March 1948. The biggest problems, however, arose with a few border states, such as Jodhpur, which tried to negotiate better deals with Pakistan, with Junagadh, which actually did accede to Pakistan, and with Hyderabad and Kashmir, which declared that they intended to remain independent.|$|E

25|$|These fashion changes {{coincided with}} health {{professionals}} beginning to link breast care and <b>comfort</b> <b>to</b> motherhood and lactation, and campaigned against breast flattening.

25|$|His {{far more}} ample prose writings, {{peppered}} with many aphorisms and bons mots, reveal a conservative and skeptical outlook on human nature, verging on the cynical.
