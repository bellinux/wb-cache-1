40|$|Most {{members of}} the {{development}} community, and especially those in multilateral and bilateral organizations, agree that politicians are centrally important to development. Fewer agree, however, on how to ensure effective political engagement in development programs and reforms. It is questionable whether many practitioners <b>or</b> <b>theoreticians</b> even have clear ideas about what effective political engagement looks like. Terms like political will and political commitment lack clarity and operational import; {{it is unclear what}} they are and even more unclear how to foster them. This chapter attempts to shed light on why such a key issue is poorly understood and to suggest ideas for thinking about it. ...|$|R

40|$|Language-teaching {{methods such as}} audio-lingualism or task-based {{instruction}} {{have been}} promoted at different times as the ‘best’ way to teach a foreign language. Each such method prescribes a set of learning procedures rooted in a particular theoretical conceptualization {{of the nature of}} language and language acquisition, based on linguistic and applied linguistics research. It is suggested in this article that the principles guiding teachers in selecting procedures should not be dictated by any particular method recommended by researchers <b>or</b> <b>theoreticians,</b> but should be rather defined as a pedagogy of language teaching, shaped by various general pedagogical – not only language-learning – considerations, as well as by local factors, and determined by the teacher her- or himself...|$|R

40|$|Urban {{planning}} in general, and discursively motivated practices attaching to urban form in particular, are beholden {{in many ways}} to notions of a âpublicâ. In fact, {{it would not be}} an exaggeration to say that urban planners continue to grapple with the idea and reality of the âpublicâ in many relevant contexts. It is also one of those terms that are customarily invoked when urban planning makes headlines in different media: from concerns over âpublicâ access to public consultation processes, from normative practices embedded in a âpublic sphereâ to public relations, from âpublic sectorâ involvement through âpublicâ policy to the everyday concerns of âpublicâ housing and âpublicâ transportâthe notion of something âpublicâ marks a dimension we as planning practitioners <b>or</b> <b>theoreticians</b> (<b>or</b> both) ignore at our individual and collective peril. This brief intervention aims to illuminate the outer contours of this âgrapplingâ in an attempt to open up future productive conversations in the pages of Urban Planning. There are at least three aspects of âthe publicâ that concern us here...|$|R

A child that has been screened with the GSEGC and displays significant developmental delay will then proceed to this step. In this process, a single <b>clinician</b> <b>or</b> <b>clinicians</b> of multiple disciplines (i.e. pediatrics, speech therapy, occupational therapy, psychology, etc.) must spend {{a significant amount of}} time observing a child. Specifically, the clinician(s) must be able to characterize how {{the degree to which a}} child is able to interact with others as it relates to developmental level.|$|R

50|$|As {{in other}} aspects of applied ethics, {{different}} approaches {{may be used to}} understand these problems; they may be seen in terms of the rights and duties involved in medical practice, or how to maximise the good through the work <b>clinicians</b> do, <b>or</b> in terms of the virtues needed to flourish as a <b>clinician</b> <b>or</b> a patient. Deciding which moral framework to apply brings primary care ethics into contact with meta-ethics and epistemology. There is increasing interest in the empirical study of primary care ethics, often using qualitative research methods, which raises important metaethical and methodological questions about the relationship between facts and values.|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{comprehensive}} review of structured family support programs in children’s mental health was con-ducted in collaboration with leadership from key national family organizations. The goals were to identify typologies of family support services for which evaluation data exis-ted and identify research gaps. Over 200 programs were examined; 50 met criteria for inclusion. Programs were categorized by whether they were delivered by peer family members, <b>clinicians,</b> <b>or</b> teams. Five salient components of family support were identified: (a) informational, (b) instructional, (c) emotional, (d) instrumental, and (e) advocacy. Clinician-led programs were heavily represented (n = 33, 66 %), followed by family-led (n = 11, 22 %), and team-delivered (n = 6, 12 %) programs. Key differences between programs delivered by <b>clinicians</b> <b>or</b> by peer family members {{were found in the}} degree of emphasis, research methodology, and outcomes. However, the content of the components was similar across all three program types. There are both important differences in emphasis across typologies of family support provided by <b>clinicians,</b> family members, <b>or</b> teams as well as important similarities in content. Family-delivered support may be an important adjunct to existing services for parents, although the research base remains thin. A research agenda to promote more rigorous evaluations of these services especially those delivered by peer family members is critical...|$|R
30|$|It is {{important}} for multisite collaborations that involve simultaneous collation of assessments to have efficient procedures for data capture that do not overburden <b>clinicians</b> <b>or</b> researchers but that maximise the likelihood of complete and accurate data entry.

This paper defines focused ethnographies, locates them within the ethnographic genre, justifies their use in healthcare research, and outlines the methodological processes...|$|R
50|$|The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is {{a rating}} scale which a <b>clinician</b> <b>or</b> {{researcher}} may use to measure psychiatric {{symptoms such as}} depression, anxiety, hallucinations and unusual behaviour.

30|$|A {{wealth of}} {{information}} on genomics is rapidly being acquired {{with the potential for}} a major impact on human health. However, these data are scattered through multiple scientific journals, reviews and state-sponsored reports and bulletins. A <b>clinician</b> <b>or</b> health professional often has difficulty in accessing and assimilating this information for application in medical and public health practice. More importantly, an inability to assimilate and interpret leads to frustration and avoidance of potentially useful information.|$|R
50|$|The <b>clinician</b> <b>or</b> {{researcher}} {{should be}} present in the room with the test-taker to prevent the subject from asking others how they should answer the question. Additionally, the administrator should only answer questions regarding the test in a non-committal fashion, reiterating that the subject may complete the stem however he or she wishes. This may even include fragmentary or non-responses, which Loevinger asserts are still of importance and must be rated as any other response.|$|R
