25|$|Significant gamma-ray {{emission}} {{from our}} galaxy was first detected in 1967 by the detector aboard the OSO-3 satellite. It detected 621 events attributable to <b>cosmic</b> <b>gamma</b> <b>rays.</b> However, {{the field of}} gamma-ray astronomy took great leaps forward with the SAS-2 (1972) and the COS-B (1975–1982) satellites. These two satellites provided an exciting view into the high-energy universe (sometimes called the 'violent' universe, because the kinds of events in space that produce gamma rays tend to be high-speed collisions and similar processes). They confirmed the earlier findings of the gamma-ray background, produced the first detailed map of the sky at gamma-ray wavelengths, and detected a number of point sources. However {{the resolution of the}} instruments was insufficient to identify most of these point sources with specific visible stars or stellar systems.|$|E

5000|$|The {{striking}} {{feature of}} split supersymmetry {{is that the}} gluino becomes a quasi-stable particle with a lifetime that could be up to 100 seconds long. A gluino that lived longer than this would disrupt Big Bang nucleosynthesis or would have been observed as an additional source of <b>cosmic</b> <b>gamma</b> <b>rays.</b> The gluino is long lived because it can only decay into a squark and a quark and because the squarks are so heavy and these decays are highly suppressed. Thus the decay rate of the gluino can roughly be estimated, in natural units, as [...] where [...] is the gluino rest mass and [...] the squark rest mass. For gluino mass {{of the order of}} 1 TeV, the cosmological bound mentioned above sets an upper bound of about [...] GeV on squarks masses.|$|E
