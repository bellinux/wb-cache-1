Timbaland said the song is [...] "very {{interesting}} — [...] this new artist on my label called SoShy from Paris. We're both rapping. The song, I can't describe it, it's so different. It's not different for me, but I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> — it fits everything {{going on with the}} vampire theme. It fits everything with Twilight". When asked about why he picked the song as the first single he said: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1940, {{while still}} {{serving in the}} army, Profumo {{was elected to the}} House of Commons as a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Kettering in Northamptonshire at a {{by-election}} on 3 March. Shortly afterwards he voted against the Chamberlain government in the debate following the British defeat at Narvik in Norway. This defiance on Profumo's part enraged the Government Whip, David Margesson, who said to him, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this,</b> you utterly contemptible little shit. On every morning that you wake up {{for the rest of your}} life you will be ashamed of what you did last night." [...] Profumo later remarked that Margesson [...] "couldn't have been more wrong." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{teamster}} laughed. [...] "It {{should come}} from me, {{but the fact is}} I was worrying about that wagon and forgot," [...] he said. [...] "Now, if there is anything I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about <b>this</b> country." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{commenting on}} the event later, Shea remarked, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that <b>this</b> {{incident}} actually strengthens my resolve to support the seal hunt.

6000|$|... "No, my friend. I {{have certain}} little ideas {{of my own}} about that will. But I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> much--it was not in Miss Howard's favour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You may see {{something}} very comical in this information, Sir--but I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this,</b> Mr. Jinks, {{that you have}} very little to laugh at,' said the magistrate.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> {{much about}} it, at all events," [...] said Will, with a laugh, [...] "that it is a Republic, and a celebrated country for gold mines." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am doing}} more," [...] he said. [...] "I {{destroyed}} my own identity, and the Douglas Guest of Feldwick is an accounted murderer by others besides Joan. I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> only <b>this,</b> Cissy. I {{did it because}} {{it seemed to me}} the best and the most merciful thing to be done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] he said cheerily, [...] "that is, wench, where I {{proclaim}} thee wrong! I do {{not know}} when thy father {{will be able to}} move, but I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> at <b>this</b> very moment where and how thou canst earn fifty guilders which should take thee quite a long way toward Spain." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Do {{you take}} his part? I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> If I {{drank too much}} of that {{poisonous}} French stuff, Mountjoy set me the example. He was tipsy--as you call it--shamefully tipsy, I give you my word of honour. What's the matter now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not? Nobody {{will hurt}} him. I don't mind {{a bit about}} having him with me now. But I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> When he went away from us once it made me very unhappy. Would Aunt Stanbury be glad to see me, Martha?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{your own}} sake," [...] he continued, [...] "there are certain facts in {{connection}} with this matter which I must withhold. All I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> is <b>this.</b> There are people who have acquired a hold upon Lucille so great that she is forced to obey their bidding. Lady Carey is one, the Duchess of Dorset is another. They are no friends of mine, and apparently Lucille has been taken away from me by them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't {{beg your}} pardon for {{speaking}} the truth," [...] said Eustace, hotly: [...] "the fact is that here you never hear the truth; all these poor devils creep and crawl about you, and daren't call their souls their own. I shall be devilish glad {{to get out of}} <b>this</b> place, I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> All <b>this</b> chickery and pokery makes me sick.

6000|$|... "Senor," [...] {{said the}} old man, [...] "that is a {{question}} which you must excuse my child from answering. Not, sir, from want of will, for she is docile and obedient, though I say it, {{but there is no}} answer beyond what I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> And <b>this</b> is, sir, that all creatures, whether man or bird, have the voice that God has given them; and in some the voice is musical and in others not so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They're engaged," [...] said Frank, [...] "and {{the best}} thing {{they can do is}} to marry each other.

5000|$|The exact set {{of rules}} divulged to new players varies between groups of players: some groups will say [...] "the only rule I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> is <b>this</b> one", others will reveal the goal of {{eliminating}} cards, and some might outline the basic rules and, in most cases, no rules are revealed at all. However much information is revealed, the players will explain {{that they are not}} allowed to reveal any more, and that the new player must deduce the full rules during play.|$|R
5000|$|After leaving Georgia, Richt {{became the}} {{head coach of the}} Miami Hurricanes at the University of Miami, his alma mater. Richt made the {{announcement}} on December 4, 2015.

3000|$|Mr. Bei: I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that <b>this</b> {{method is}} pretty simple. Look at the state’s laws, and then {{compare them with}} the {{administrative}} rules of City B. Another hint: the administrative agencies are executors. They should execute “laws.” … In other words, local authorities should enforce laws without adding their own stuff. The stuff they added, like administrative rules and regulations, must conform to laws, otherwise they are invalid. Local governments cannot invent something by themselves and set them as laws, saying you should have everything done accordingly. That’s not how it works. The local rules contradict the laws, so they are invalid. (Field interview Nov. 23, 2005) [...]...|$|R

In some cases, government employees we once checked in with regularly will no longer speak to us by phone. Others are reluctant to meet in person... And I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> that <b>this</b> chilling effect on newsgathering is not just limited to AP.

6000|$|... "That's {{not for me}} to say," [...] replied Mocker modestly. [...] "But I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this,</b> Peter, they {{do think}} a lot of me down there. There are many birds down there who are very {{beautiful}}ly dressed, birds who don't come up here at all. But not one of them is loved as I am, and it is all on account of my voice. I would rather have a beautiful voice than a fine coat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's not philanthropy," [...] the sub-editor answered. [...] "If {{you asked}} me to put into L. s. d. what those {{articles}} were worth to us, I couldn't tell you. But I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> We've paid thousands down more than once, for an advertisement which wasn't worth half so much as those few sheets of manuscript.

[...] "It's {{all very}} well for you to joke about it, and laugh at me, but I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that <b>this</b> account won't balance; there is a two-and-sixpence wrong somewhere, {{and you know it}} has to be all copied out and sent off by the evening post to-morrow. I really can't {{understand}} why we are called upon to make so many copies of all the accounts and papers for that ridiculous Board of Trade; I'm sure they have plenty of idle clerks of their own, without requiring us to slave as we do--for such a wretched salary, too!" ...|$|R
