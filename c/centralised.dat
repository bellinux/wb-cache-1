A 380MHz digital trunked TETRA radio communication system from Motorola is used on all lines to carry both voice and data information. For Blue Line Siemens Transportation Systems has supplied the electronic interlocking Sicas, the operation control system Vicos OC 500 and the automation control system LZB 700 M. An integrated system comprising optical fibre cable, on-train radio, CCTV, and a <b>centralised</b> clock and public address system is used for telecommunication during train operations as well as emergencies. For Red and Yellow lines ALSTOM has supplied signalling system and for Green and Violet lines Bombardier Transportation has supplied CITYFLO 350 signalling system.|$|E
5|$|The early European {{settlers}} divided New Zealand into provinces, {{which had}} a degree of autonomy. Because of financial pressures {{and the desire to}} consolidate railways, education, land sales and other policies, government was <b>centralised</b> and the provinces were abolished in 1876. The provinces are remembered in regional public holidays and sporting rivalries.|$|E

5|$|Above all, however, Joseph {{attempted}} {{to break up}} the structure of autonomous states which provided the framework for the Austrian Netherlands. He introduced two reforms in early 1787 instituting new administrative and judicial reform to create a much more <b>centralised</b> system. The first decree abolished many of the administrative structures which had existed since the rule of Emperor Charles V (1500–58) were replaced by a single General Council of Government under a minister-plenipotentiary. In addition, nine administrative circles (cercles), each controlled by an Intendant, were created to which much {{of the power of the}} states was devolved. A second decree abolished the ad hoc semi-feudal or ecclesiastical courts operated by the states and replaced them with a <b>centralised</b> system similar to that already in place in Austria. A single Sovereign Council of Justice was established in Brussels, with two appeal courts in Brussels and Luxembourg, and around 40 local district courts.|$|E

In August he met with the Governor of Kenya, Patrick Muir Renison, at Kiambu, and he was interviewed by the BBC's Face to Face program. In August he also attended a KANU-KADU meeting, where the two parties disagreed on the question of federalism: KANU wanted a <b>centralised</b> state while KADU feared that this would result in Kikuyu dominance of an independent Kenya.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, Usman dan Fodio directed a successful jihad and created and led the <b>centralised</b> Fulani Empire (also known as the Sokoto Caliphate). The territory controlled by the resultant state included much of modern-day northern and central Nigeria; it lasted until the 1903 break-up of the Empire into various European colonies.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} <b>centralising</b> algebra {{of a natural}} action of the hyperoctahedral group (i. e., a finite Weyl group of type B r) on the r -th tensor power of a 2 n -dimensional space.

5|$|Citizens in {{the south}} were opposed to a <b>centralised</b> government, and to the decrees of its rule, which {{resulted}} in rebellion. Prior to the revolution France had been divided into provinces with local governments. In 1790 the government, the National Constituent Assembly, reorganised France into administrative departments in order to rebalance the uneven distribution of French wealth, which had been subject to feudalism under the monarchical Ancien Régime.|$|E
5|$|Constitutionally, Turkey is a {{parliamentary}} representative democracy. Since its foundation as a republic in 1923, Turkey {{has developed a}} strong tradition of secularism. Turkey's constitution governs the legal framework of the country. It sets out the main principles of government and establishes Turkey as a unitary <b>centralised</b> state. The President of the Republic {{is the head of}} state and has a largely ceremonial role. The president is elected for a five-year term by direct elections and Tayyip Erdoğan is the first president elected by direct voting.|$|E
