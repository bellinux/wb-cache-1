40|$|The {{technical}} {{importance of}} variable amplitude (spectrum) loading {{is not only}} given by obtaining much longer fatigue lives compared with those determined under <b>constant</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>loading</b> with the maximum value of the spectrum. It also enables the lightweight potential resulting from proper consideration of the exceeding of the Woehler-lines (<b>constant</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>loading)</b> by the Gassner-lines (variable amplitude loading) for a required duration. The degree of exceeding at the required service duration allows higher design stresses than under <b>constant</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>loading</b> and is decisive in determining to what extent cross sections and hence weights can be reduced. However, the experimental determination of Gassner-lines is time and cost consuming, while their estimation by cumulative damage, i. e. fatigue life, calculations, is subject to underlying large uncertainties.

A hybrid-displacement finite element procedure is used to properly treat the stress and strain singularities near the crack-tip; and crack-growth under cyclic loading is simulated by the translation of certain 'core' elements, near the crack-tip, in which proper stress and strain singularities were embedded. Both pure mode I and mode II types of cyclic loading are considered.
