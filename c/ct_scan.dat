40|$|Objective: To {{quantify}} the radiation dose in the thyroid attributable to different <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> and {{to estimate the}} thyroid cancer risk in pediatric patients. Methods: The information about pediatric patients who underwent <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> was abstracted from the radiology information system in one general hospital between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2012. The radiation doses were calculated using the ImPACT Patient Dosimetry Calculator and the lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of thyroid cancer incidence was estimated based on the National Academies Biologic Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII model. Results: The subjects comprised 922 children, 68 % were males, and received 971 <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> The range of typical radiation dose to the thyroid {{was estimated to be}} 0. 61 – 0. 92 mGy for paranasal sinus <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> 1. 10 – 2. 45 mGy for head <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> and 2. 63 – 5. 76 mGy for chest <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> The LAR of thyroid cancer were as follows: for head CT, 1. 1 per 100, 000 for boys and 8. 7 per 100, 000 for girls; for paranasal sinus <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> 0. 4 per 100, 000 for boys and 2. 7 per 100, 000 for girls; for chest <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> 2. 2 per 100, 000 for boys and 14. 2 per 100, 000 for girls. The risk of thyroid cancer was substantially higher for girls than for the boys, and from chest <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> was higher than that from head or paransal sinus <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> Conclusions: Chest <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> caused higher thyroid dose and the LAR of thyroid cancer incidence, compared with paransal sinus or head <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> Therefore, physicians should pay more attention to protect the thyroid when children underwent <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> especially chest <b>CT</b> <b>scans...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{performance}} of computed tomography (<b>CT)</b> <b>scanning</b> for ascertaining sacroiliitis in patients with suspected spondylarthritis (SpA). METHODS: The Echography in Spondylarthritis French cohort consists of 489 patients with suspected SpA. At baseline, all patients underwent clinical examination, HLA-B typing, and pelvic radiography. Pelvic <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> was performed if sacroiliitis on radiography was considered uncertain or if patients presented with buttock pain duration of > 6 months. A set of 100 paired radiographs and <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> was read in a blinded manner by 2 radiologists, and the kappa coefficient {{was used to assess}} their interreader reliability. One of the radiologists read the 173 available pairs of radiographs and <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> performed at baseline. RESULTS: After training, interreader reliability was moderate for sacroiliitis grading on radiographs (κ = 0. 59), excellent on <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> (κ = 0. 91), and excellent for ascertaining sacroiliitis on both radiographs (κ = 1) and <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> (κ = 0. 96). The first and second readers considered the quality of imaging to be excellent in 66 % and 67 %, respectively, of the radiographs (κ = 0. 88) and in 93 % and 92 %, respectively, of the <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> (κ = 0. 93). Concordance between radiographs and <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> was low for sacroiliitis grading (κ = 0. 08) or ascertainment (κ = 0. 16). Definite sacroiliitis was ascertained on radiographs in 6 patients (3. 5 %) (confirmed by <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> in 4 patients) and on <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> in 32 patients (18. 5 %). A history of uveitis was associated with definite sacroiliitis on radiographs (P = 0. 04) and <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> (P < 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: Definite sacroiliitis was underestimated by radiography, as compared to <b>CT</b> <b>scanning.</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> should facilitate the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis in patients with suspected SpA...|$|R

40|$|Background: Computed {{tomography}} (<b>CT)</b> <b>scanning</b> is {{a relatively}} high radiation dose diagnostic imaging modality with increasing concerns about radiation exposure burden at the population level in scientific literature. This study examined the epidemiology of adult CT utilisation in Western Australia (WA) in both the public hospital and private practice settings, and the policy implications. Methods: Retrospective cohort design using aggregate adult CT data from WA public hospitals and Medical Benefits Schedule (MBS) (mid- 2006 to mid- 2012). <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> trends by sex, age, provider setting and anatomical areas were explored using crude <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> rates, age-standardised <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> rates and Poisson regression modelling. Results: From mid- 2006 to mid- 2012 the WA adult <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> rate was 129 scans per 1, 000 person-years (PY). Females were consistently scanned {{at a higher rate}} than males. Patients over 65 years presented the highest scanning rates (over 300 scans per 1, 000 PY). Private practice accounted for 73 % of adult <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> comprising the majority in every anatomical area. In the private setting females predominately held higher age-standardised <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> rates than males. This trend reversed in the public hospital setting. Patients over 85 years in the public hospital setting were the most likely age group <b>CT</b> <b>scanned</b> in nine of ten anatomical areas. Patients in the private practice setting aged 85 + years were relatively less prominent across every anatomical area, and the least likely age group scanned in facial bones and multiple areas <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> Conclusion: In comparison to the public hospital setting, the MBS subsidised private sector tended to service females and relatively younger patients with a more diverse range of anatomical areas, constituting the majority of <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> performed in WA. Patient risk and subsequent burden is greater for females, lower ages and some anatomical areas. In the context of a national health system, Australia has various avenues to monitor radiation exposure levels, improve physician training and modify funding mechanisms to ensure individual and population medical radiation exposure is as low as reasonably achievable...|$|R
