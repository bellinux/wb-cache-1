25|$|Accelerator-based light-ion fusion is a {{technique}} using particle accelerators to achieve particle kinetic energies sufficient to induce light-ion fusion reactions. Accelerating light ions is relatively easy, and {{can be done in}} an efficient manner—requiring only a vacuum tube, a pair of electrodes, and a high-voltage transformer; fusion can be observed with as little as 10 kV between the electrodes. The key problem with accelerator-based fusion (and with cold targets in general) is that fusion cross sections are many orders of magnitude lower than <b>Coulomb</b> <b>interaction</b> cross sections. Therefore, the vast majority of ions expend their energy emitting bremsstrahlung radiation and the ionization of atoms of the target. Devices referred to as sealed-tube neutron generators are particularly relevant to this discussion. These small devices are miniature particle accelerators filled with deuterium and tritium gas in an arrangement that allows ions of those nuclei to be accelerated against hydride targets, also containing deuterium and tritium, where fusion takes place, releasing a flux of neutrons. Hundreds of neutron generators are produced annually for use in the petroleum industry where they are used in measurement equipment for locating and mapping oil reserves.|$|E
500|$|The metal is {{hard and}} brittle at most {{temperatures}} but becomes malleable between 100 and 150°C. Above 210°C, the metal becomes brittle again {{and can be}} pulverized by beating. Zinc is a fair conductor of electricity. For a metal, zinc has relatively low melting (419.5°C, 787.1F) and boiling points (907°C). Cadmium is similar in many respects to zinc but forms complex compounds. Unlike other metals, cadmium is resistant to corrosion {{and as a result}} it is used as a protective layer when deposited on other metals. As a bulk metal, cadmium is insoluble in water and is not [...] flammable; however, in its powdered form it may burn and release toxic fumes. Mercury has an exceptionally low melting temperature for a d-block metal. A complete explanation of this fact requires a deep excursion into quantum physics, but it can be summarized as follows: mercury has a unique electronic configuration where electrons fill up all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d and 6s subshells. As such configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves similarly to noble gas elements, which form weak bonds and thus easily melting solids. The stability of the 6s shell is due to the presence of a filled 4f shell. An f shell poorly screens the nuclear charge that increases the attractive <b>Coulomb</b> <b>interaction</b> of the 6s shell and the nucleus (see lanthanide contraction). The absence of a filled inner f shell is the reason for the somewhat higher melting temperature of cadmium and zinc, although both these metals still melt easily and, in addition, have unusually low boiling points. Gold has atoms with one less 6s electron than mercury. Those electrons are more easily removed and are shared between the gold atoms forming relatively strong metallic bonds.|$|E

Most of these strongly correlated materials consist of valence bands derived from electronic d shells where intra- and inter-orbital <b>Coulomb</b> <b>interactions</b> are equally important and where the crystal structure splits the valence bands into narrow and wide subbands. A fundamental question is whether these systems exhibit a common Mott transition, implying all subbands to be either metallic or insulating, or successive orbital dependent transitions, implying a coexistence region with metallic and insulating behavior present in different subbands. Using the dynamical mean field theory we show that inter-orbital <b>Coulomb</b> <b>interactions</b> lead to a single Mott transition.
