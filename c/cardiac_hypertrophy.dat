40|$|Inhibition of {{glycogen}} synthase kinase 3 β (GSK 3 β) {{as a consequence}} of its phosphorylation by protein kinase B/Akt (PKB/Akt) has been implicated in <b>cardiac</b> myocyte <b>hypertrophy</b> in response to endothelin- 1 or phenylephrine. We examined the regulation of GSK 3 α (which we show to constitute a significant proportion of the myocyte GSK 3 pool) and GSK 3 β in cardiac myocytes. Although endothelin increases phosphorylation of GSK 3 and decreases its activity, the response is less than that induced by insulin (which does not promote <b>cardiac</b> myocyte <b>hypertrophy).</b> GSK 3 phosphorylation induced by endothelin requires signalling through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 (ERK 1 / 2) cascade and not the PKB/Akt pathway, whereas the reverse is true for insulin. <b>Cardiac</b> myocyte <b>hypertrophy</b> involves changes in morphology, and in gene and protein expression. The potent GSK 3 inhibitor 1 -azakenpaullone increases myocyte area {{as a consequence of}} increased cell length whereas phenylephrine increases both length and width. Azakenpaullone or insulin promotes AP 1 transcription factor binding to an AP 1 consensus oligonucleotide, but this was significantly less than that induced by endothelin and derived principally from increased binding of JunB protein, the expression of which was increased. Azakenpaullone promotes significant changes in gene expression (assessed by Affymetrix microarrays), but the overall response is less than with endothelin and there is little overlap between the genes identified. Thus, although GSK 3 may contribute to <b>cardiac</b> myocyte <b>hypertrophy</b> in some respects (and presumably {{plays an important role in}} myocyte metabolism), it does not appear to contribute as significantly to the response induced by endothelin as has been maintained...|$|R

PKG- 1 activity is associated with the regression of <b>cardiac</b> myocyte <b>hypertrophy.</b> The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that VEGFR- 1 is associated with PKG- 1 and their association is involved in Cu induced regression of cardiomyocyte <b>hypertrophy.</b> Human <b>cardiac</b> myocytes (HCM) in cultures were exposed to phenylephrine (PE) at a final concentration of 100 µM for 48 hours to induce cell hypertrophy.

Both hypertrophic and hypertrophic-reversed HCM cells underwent immunoprecipitation using anti-VEGFR- 1 antibody or anti-PKG- 1 antibody. The immune complex underwent gel-electrophoresis separation and Western blotting and LC-MSIMS analysis. Proteomic analysis identified Vimentin in the immune complexes that immunoprecipitated with VEGFR- 1 and PKG- 1.

25|$|In animal {{models of}} cardiac disease, {{functions}} of beta-catenin have been unveiled. In a guinea pig model of aortic stenosis and left ventricular hypertrophy, beta-catenin {{was shown to}} change subcellular localization from intercalated discs to the cytosol, despite {{no change in the}} overall cellular abundance of beta-catenin. vinculin showed a similar profile of change. N-cadherin showed no change, and there was no compensatory upregulation of plakoglobin at intercalated discs in the absence of beta-catenin. In a hamster model of cardiomyopathy and heart failure, cell-cell adhesions were irregular and disorganized, and expression levels of adherens junction/intercalated disc and nuclear pools of beta-catenin were decreased. These data suggest that a loss of beta-catenin {{may play a role in}} the diseased intercalated discs that have been associated with cardiac muscle hypertrophy and heart failure. In a rat model of myocardial infarction, adenoviral gene transfer of nonphosphorylatable, constitutively-active beta-catenin decreased MI size, activated the cell cycle, and reduced the amount of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes and cardiac myofibroblasts. This finding was coordinate with enhanced expression of pro-survival proteins, survivin and Bcl-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor while promoting the differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. These findings suggest that beta-catenin can promote the regeneration and healing process following myocardial infarction. In a spontaneously-hypertensive heart failure rat model, investigators detected a shuttling of beta-catenin from the intercalated disc/sarcolemma to the nucleus, evidenced by a reduction of beta-catenin expression in the membrane protein fraction and an increase in the nuclear fraction. Additionally, they found a weakening in the association between glycogen synthase kinase-3β and beta-catenin, which may indicate altered protein stability. Overall, results suggest that an enhanced nuclear localization of beta-catenin may be important in the progression of <b>cardiac</b> <b>hypertrophy.</b>|$|E

Wistar STZ-induced diabetic rats received garlic oil (0, 10, 50 or 100 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 body weight) by gastric gavage every 2 days for 16 days. Normal rats without diabetes were used as control. Cardiac contractile dysfunction and <b>cardiac</b> pathologic <b>hypertrophy</b> responses were observed in diabetic rat hearts. Cardiac function was examined using echocardiography. In addition to cardiac hypertrophy-related mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathways (e. g., p 38, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and extracellularly responsive kinase (ERK 1 / 2)), the IL- 6 /MEK 5 /ERK 5 signaling pathway was greatly activated in the diabetic rat hearts, which contributes to the up-regulation of <b>cardiac</b> pathologic <b>hypertrophy</b> markers including atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and leads to cardiac contractile dysfunction. Garlic oil treatment significantly inhibited the up-regulation in MAPK (e. g., p 38, JNK and ERK 1 / 2) and IL- 6 /MEK 5 /ERK 5 signaling pathways in the diabetic rat hearts, reducing the levels of <b>cardiac</b> pathologic <b>hypertrophy</b> markers such as ANP and BNP, and improving the cardiac contractile function.

2500|$|Regarding the {{mechanistic}} role of beta-catenin in <b>cardiac</b> <b>hypertrophy,</b> {{transgenic mouse}} {{studies have shown}} somewhat conflicting results regarding whether upregulation of beta-catenin is beneficial or detrimental. A recent study using a conditional knockout mouse that either lacked beta-catenin altogether or expressed a non-degradable form of beta-catenin in cardiomyocytes reconciled a potential reason for these discrepancies. There appears to be strict control over the subcellular localization of beta-catenin in cardiac muscle. Mice lacking beta-catenin had no overt phenotype in the left ventricular myocardium; however, mice harboring a stabilized form of beta-catenin developed dilated cardiomyopathy, suggesting that the temporal regulation of beta-catenin by protein degradation mechanisms is critical for normal functioning of beta-catenin in cardiac cells. In a mouse model harboring knockout of a desmosomal protein, plakoglobin, implicated in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, the stabilization of beta-catenin was also enhanced, presumably {{to compensate for the}} loss of its plakogloblin homolog. These changes were coordinate with Akt activation and glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibition, suggesting once again that the abnormal stabilization of beta-catenin may be involved in the development of cardiomyopathy. [...] Further studies employing a double knockout of plakoglobin and beta-catenin showed that the double knockout developed cardiomyopathy, fibrosis and arrhythmias resulting in sudden cardiac death. Intercalated disc architecture was severely impaired and connexin 43-resident gap junctions were markedly reduced. Electrocardiogram measurements captured spontaneous lethal ventricular arrhythmias in the double transgenic animals, suggesting that the two catenins—beta-catenin and plakoglobin are critical and idispensible for mechanoelectrical coupling in cardiomyocytes.|$|E

All three HDACs work to repress the myogenic transcription factor MEF2 which {{an essential role in}} muscle differentiation as a DNA binding transcription factor. Binding of HDACs to MEF2 inhibits muscle differentiation, which can be reversed by action of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMK) which works to dissociate the HDAC/MEF2 complex by phosphorylating the HDAC portion. They have been seen to be involved in cellular hypertrophy in muscle control differentiation as well as cellular hypertrophy in muscle and cartilage tissues. HDACs 5 and 7 have been shown to work in opposition to HDAC4 during muscle differentiation regulation so as to keep a proper level of expression. There has been evidence that these HDACs also interact with HDAC3 as a co-recruitment factor to the SMRT/N-CoR factors in the nucleus. Absence of the HDAC3 enzyme has shown to lead to inactivity which makes researchers believe that HDACs 4, 5 and 7 [...] help the incorporation of DNA-binding recruiters for the HDAC3-containing HDAC complexes located in the nucleus. When HDAC4 is knocked out in mice, they suffer from a pronounced chondrocyte hypertrophy and die due to extreme ossification. HDAC7 has been shown to suppress Nur77-dependent apoptosis.

40|$|Sodium ion {{transporters}} in sarcolemma {{are involved}} in numerous vital cell functions, such as excitability, excitation-contraction coupling, energy metabolism, pH and volume regulation, development and growth. In a number of cardiac pathologies, the intracellular sodium concentration ([Na+]i) is elevated. Since [Na+]i and intracellular Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i are coupled through the Na+/Ca(2 +) -exchanger, these cardiac pathologies display disturbed calcium handling. For instance, [Na+]i is increased in heart failure (HF) leading to Na+/Ca(2 +) -exchanger mediated increase in [Ca 2 +]i, reduced contractility and increased propensity to arrhythmias. Several studies support the contention that an increase in [Na+]i and [Ca 2 +]i transduces a signal the nucleus, that triggers development of <b>cardiac</b> remodelling and <b>hypertrophy.</b> Pharmacological intervention, which favourably interferes with [Na+]i and [Ca 2 +]i homeostasis, might prevent <b>hypertrophy,</b> <b>cardiac</b> remodelling, arrhythmias and HF. The most important sodium transport mechanisms that may underlie increased [Na+]i are: Na+/H(+) -exchanger (NHE- 1), Na+-HCO(3) (-) co-transporter (NBC), Na(+) -K(+) -Cl(-) co-transporter (NKCC), Na(+) -channel, Na+/K(+) -ATPase and Na+/Ca(2 +) -exchanger (NCX). Preclinical studies showed that pharmacological interventions, targeted against sarcolemmal sodium ion transporters, proved effective in ameliorating heart failure. In this respect: 1) NHE- 1 inhibition reduces <b>cardiac</b> remodelling, <b>hypertrophy</b> and HF, although, in the patients following {{coronary artery bypass graft}} surgery, it was associated with an increase of stroke. 2) The activity of NBC is up-regulated, during the development of hypertrophy and may be a therapeutic strategy to prevent the development of hypertrophy and HF. 3) NKCC is increased in post-infarction HF, and the inhibition of NKCC attenuated post-infarction remodelling. 4) Inactivation of sodium channels is impaired in HF, which may result, in increased Na+ influx and prolongation of the action potential. 5) Blockade of NCX may be useful {{as a part of a}} combined therapeutic approach.
