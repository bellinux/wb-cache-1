Many foods are deep-fried and cultures surrounding deep frying have developed, most notably in the Southern United States, where many events dedicated to deep frying food and non-edible items are held.|$|E
5|$|Most onion cultivars {{are about}} 89% water, 9% {{carbohydrates}} (including 4% sugar and 2% dietary fibre), 1% protein, and negligible fat (table). Onions contain low amounts of essential nutrients {{and have an}} energy value of 166 kJ (40 Calories) in a 100g (3.5oz) amount. Onions contribute savoury flavour to dishes without contributing significant <b>caloric</b> content.|$|E
5|$|This {{thesis of}} a {{maritime}} foundation was {{contrary to the}} general scholarly consensus that the rise of civilization was based on intensive agriculture, particularly {{of at least one}} cereal. The production of agricultural surpluses had long been seen as essential in promoting population density and the emergence of complex society. Moseley's ideas would be debated and challenged (that maritime remains and their <b>caloric</b> contribution were overestimated, for example) but have been treated as plausible as late as Mann's summary of the literature in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Triglycerides, {{stored in}} adipose tissue, {{are a major}} form of energy storage both in animals and plants. The adipocyte, or fat cell, is {{designed}} for continuous synthesis and breakdown of triglycerides in animals, with breakdown controlled mainly by the activation of hormone-sensitive enzyme lipase. The complete oxidation of fatty acids provides high <b>caloric</b> content, about 9kcal/g, compared with 4kcal/g for the breakdown of carbohydrates and proteins. Migratory birds that must fly long distances without eating use stored energy of triglycerides to fuel their flights.|$|E
5|$|Carrion, fungi, fruits such as chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), {{and seeds}} are also eaten. Two grey jays were seen eating slime mold (Fuligo septica) near Kennedy Hot Springs in the Glacier Peak Wilderness, Washington. This {{was the first}} report of any bird {{consuming}} slime mold in the field. Risk and energy expenditure are factors in food selection for the grey jay, which selects food {{on the basis of}} profitability to maximize <b>caloric</b> intake. Increased handling, searching, or recognition times for a preferred food item lowers its profitability. Grey jays wrench, twist, and tug food apart, unlike other birds known as jays (such as the blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata), which grasp and hammer their food. Grey jays commonly carry large food items to nearby trees to eat or process for storage, possibly as defense against large scavengers.|$|E
5|$|Bliege Bird et al. {{observed}} turtle {{hunting and}} spear fishing patterns in a Meriam {{community in the}} Torres Strait of Australia, publishing their findings in 2001. Here, only some Meriam men were able to accumulate high <b>caloric</b> gains {{for the amount of}} time spent turtle hunting or spear fishing (reaching a threshold measured in kcal/h). Since a daily catch of fish is carried home by hand and turtles are frequently served at large feasts, members of the community know which men most reliably brought them turtle meat and fish. Thus, turtle hunting qualifies as a costly signal. Furthermore, turtle hunting and spear fishing are actually less productive (in kcal/h) than foraging for shellfish, where success depends only on the amount of time dedicated to searching, so shellfish foraging is a poor signal of skill or strength. This suggests that energetic gains are not the primary reason men take part in turtle hunting and spear fishing. A follow-up study found that successful Meriam hunters do experience greater social benefits and reproductive success than less skilled hunters.|$|E
5|$|Koalas {{typically}} inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and {{the leaves}} of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and <b>caloric</b> content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers' pouches, where they stay {{for the first six}} to seven months of their lives. These young koalas, known as joeys, are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala retrovirus, as well as by bushfires and droughts.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the men of}} Ifaluk atoll, costly {{signalling}} {{theory can}} also explain why men torch fish. Torch fishing is a ritualized method of fishing on Ifaluk whereby men use torches made from dried coconut fronds to catch large dog-toothed tuna. Preparation for torch fishing requires significant time investments and involves {{a great deal of}} organization. Due to the time and energetic costs of preparation, torch fishing results in net <b>caloric</b> losses for fishers. Therefore, torch fishing is a handicap that serves to signal men’s productivity. Torch fishing is the most advertised fishing occupation on Ifaluk. Women and others usually spend time observing the canoes as they sail beyond the reef. Also, local rituals help to broadcast information about which fishers are successful and enhance fishers’ reputations during the torch fishing season. Several ritual behavioural and dietary constraints clearly distinguish torch fishers from other men. First, males are only permitted to torch fish if they participated {{on the first day of}} the fishing season. The community is well informed as to who participates on this day, and can easily identify the torch fishers. Second, torch fishers receive all of their meals at the canoe house and are prohibited from eating certain foods. People frequently discuss the qualities of torch fishermen. On Ifaluk, women claim that they are looking for hard-working mates. With the distinct sexual division of labor on Ifaluk, industriousness is a highly valued characteristic in males. Torch fishing thus provides women with reliable information on the work ethic of prospective mates, which makes it an honest costly signal.|$|E
25|$|Although {{it may be}} hard {{today to}} {{understand}} the allure of the <b>caloric</b> theory, at the time it seemed to have some clear advantages. Carnot's successful theory of heat engines had also been based on the <b>caloric</b> assumption, and only later was it proved by Lord Kelvin that Carnot's mathematics were equally valid without assuming a <b>caloric</b> fluid.|$|E
25|$|In rodents, <b>caloric</b> {{restriction}} slows {{aging and}} extends lifespan. At least 4 {{studies have shown}} that <b>caloric</b> restriction reduces 8-OHdG damages in various organs of rodents. One of these studies showed that <b>caloric</b> restriction reduced accumulation of 8-OHdG with age in rat brain, heart and skeletal muscle, and in mouse brain, heart, kidney and liver. More recently, Wolf et al. showed that dietary restriction reduced accumulation of 8-OHdG with age in rat brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and liver. Thus reduction of oxidative DNA damage is associated with a slower rate of aging and increased lifespan.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of the eighteenth century, Mikhail Lomonosov, a Russian scientist, {{postulated}} his corpusculo-kinetic theory of heat, which rejected the idea of a <b>caloric.</b> Through the results of empirical studies, Lomonosov {{came to the conclusion that}} heat was not transferred through the particles of the <b>caloric</b> fluid.|$|E
25|$|However, Joule's {{interest}} {{diverted from}} the narrow financial question {{to that of}} how much work could be extracted from a given source, leading him to speculate about the convertibility of energy. In 1843 he published results of experiments showing that the heating effect he had quantified in 1841 was due to generation of heat in the conductor and not its transfer from {{another part of the}} equipment. This was a direct challenge to the <b>caloric</b> theory which held that heat could neither be created or destroyed. <b>Caloric</b> theory had dominated thinking in the science of heat since introduced by Antoine Lavoisier in 1783. Lavoisier's prestige and the practical success of Sadi Carnot's <b>caloric</b> theory of the heat engine since 1824 ensured that the young Joule, working outside either academia or the engineering profession, had a difficult road ahead. Supporters of the <b>caloric</b> theory readily pointed to the symmetry of the Peltier–Seebeck effect to claim that heat and current were convertible in an, at least approximately, reversible process.|$|E

25|$|The first {{substantial}} experimental {{challenges to}} <b>caloric</b> theory arose in Rumford's 1798 work, {{when he showed}} that boring cast iron cannons produced great amounts of heat which he ascribed to friction, and his work {{was among the first}} to undermine the <b>caloric</b> theory. The development of the steam engine also focused attention on calorimetry and the amount of heat produced from different types of coal. The first quantitative research on the heat changes during chemical reactions was initiated by Lavoisier using an ice calorimeter following research by Joseph Black on the latent heat of water.|$|E
25|$|More {{quantitative}} {{studies by}} James Prescott Joule in 1843 onwards provided soundly reproducible phenomena, {{and helped to}} place the subject of thermodynamics on a solid footing. William Thomson, for example, {{was still trying to}} explain Joule's observations within a <b>caloric</b> framework as late as 1850. The utility and explanatory power of kinetic theory, however, soon started to displace <b>caloric</b> and it was largely obsolete {{by the end of the}} 19th century. Joseph Black and Lavoisier made important contributions in the precise measurement of heat changes using the calorimeter, a subject which became known as thermochemistry.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though he}} was working with the <b>caloric</b> theory, Sadi Carnot in 1824 {{suggested}} that some of the <b>caloric</b> available for generating useful work is lost in any real process. In March 1851, while grappling {{to come to terms with}} the work of James Prescott Joule, Lord Kelvin started to speculate that there was an inevitable loss of useful heat in all processes. The idea was framed even more dramatically by Hermann von Helmholtz in 1854, giving birth to the spectre of the heat death of the universe.|$|E

25|$|One {{prominent}} and very popular theory states that lifespan can be lengthened by a tight budget for food energy called <b>caloric</b> restriction. <b>Caloric</b> restriction observed in many animals (most notably mice and rats) shows a near doubling of life span {{from a very}} limited calorific intake. Support for the theory has been bolstered by several new studies linking lower basal metabolic rate to increased life expectancy. That {{is the key to}} why animals like giant tortoises can live so long. Studies of humans with life spans of at least 100 have shown a link to decreased thyroid activity, resulting in their lowered metabolic rate.|$|E
25|$|In 1798, Count Rumford (Benjamin Thompson) {{performed}} {{measurements of}} the frictional heat generated in boring cannons, and developed the idea that heat {{is a form of}} kinetic energy; his measurements refuted <b>caloric</b> theory, but were imprecise enough to leave room for doubt.|$|E
25|$|A brain-dead {{individual}} has no clinical evidence of brain function upon physical examination. This includes no response to pain and no cranial nerve reflexes.

25|$|A key {{stage in}} the {{development}} of the modern conservation principle was the demonstration of the mechanical equivalent of heat. The <b>caloric</b> theory maintained that heat could neither be created nor destroyed, whereas conservation of energy entails the contrary principle that heat and mechanical work are interchangeable.|$|E
25|$|The website also criticizes some practices, such as <b>caloric</b> {{restriction}} and the Dean Ornish program, {{because they}} {{are considered to be}} too difficult for many people to follow, not {{because they are}} ineffective; It also argues against resveratrol, which it deems to have inadequate research backing.|$|E
25|$|The USDA's {{recommended}} daily intake (RDI) of added sugars {{is less than}} 10 teaspoons per day for a 2,000-calorie diet.

25|$|In {{some studies}} calorie {{restriction}} {{has been shown}} to extend the life of mice, yeast, and rhesus monkeys.
