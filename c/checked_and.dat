30|$|Theoretical {{opinions}} differ {{regarding the}} evaluation of the relationship between <b>check</b> <b>and</b> control mechanisms and trust. On the one hand, it is assumed that <b>check</b> <b>and</b> control mechanisms are interlaced with trust and thus are not mutually exclusive. Möllering [48], however, believes in the duality rather than the dualism of <b>check</b> <b>and</b> control mechanisms and trust. According to him, the <b>check</b> <b>and</b> control mechanism of a system may be the prerequisite of trust and, in turn, the trust in the system may encourage the trust in its <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> control. Indeed, a system is trusted because it provides mechanisms of <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> control. By extension, the control mechanisms are also trusted [see also 49, 50]. Nooteboom [36] arranges trust <b>and</b> <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> control in a time sequence by assuming that trust becomes necessary when <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> control end [ibid.: 4]. Luhmann [1], in contrast, expresses a more radical view by saying that the transparency created through <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> control does not require trust at all. If, on the other hand, <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> control are taken as statements of mistrust, they gain, according to Luhmann [ibid.: 113], a system-stabilising function: “Whether systems are trusted … may … decisively depend on whether trust is suspended at critical points and mistrust is applied”. 3 With regard to trust towards institutions, Shapiro [50] argues that the <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> control of these institutions might set off a spiral of mistrust [ibid.: 652]. On the other hand, trust <b>and</b> <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> control are regarded as compatible with each other. Hartmann [37], for example, assumes that those who have trust do not need monitoring and control and will do without. Luhmann [1 : 26] says that it is contradictory “to the function and style of trust to demand or offer detailed factual information and expert proof” [see also 4].|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: One {{expression}} of the core psychopathology of eating disorders is the repeated <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> avoidance of shape or weight. Two studies are reported. The {{primary purpose of the}} first was to describe the phenomenology of such body <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> avoidance. The aim of the second was to compare body <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> avoidance in women with and without a clinical eating disorder. METHOD: In Study 1, 64 female patients with clinical eating disorders participated in a semistructured interview assessing the features of body <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> avoidance. In the second study, a self-report questionnaire was used to compare body <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> avoidance in women with and without a clinical eating disorder (n = 110). RESULTS: The majority (92 %) of the patients in Study 1 checked their bodies to assess their shape or weight and this was associated significantly with eating disorder symptoms. In Study 2, the clinical group had significantly more body <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> avoidance than the comparison group, and there was a strong association between eating disorder psychopathology <b>and</b> body <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> avoidance.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances and democracy, focusing on Turkey in comparative perspective. In a large-N setting, the effects of <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances {{on the quality of}} democracy are examined. The findings reinforce the essential relationship between democracy <b>and</b> <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances. The article then discusses the implications of the the findings for Turkey. It stresses the need for horizontal accountability via <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances vested in different state agencies. In addition to state-level <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances, the importance of societal actors as sources of accountability is also elaborated. The study identifies the need for vertical accountability, not only through free elections but also by creating a political setting in which pluralistic media and civil society can thrive. In light of findings, the article stresses the need for a new constitutional framework that can embrace both state- <b>and</b> societal-level <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances. © 2015 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
5|$|Hyde Park {{was created}} for hunting by Henry Vlll in 1536 after he {{acquired}} the manor of Hyde from the Abbey. It was enclosed as a deer park and remained a private hunting ground until James I permitted limited access to gentlefolk, appointing a ranger to take charge. Charles I created the Ring (north of the present Serpentine boathouses), and in 1637 he opened the park to the general public. It quickly became a popular gathering place, particularly for May Day celebrations. At {{the start of the}} English Civil War in 1642, a series of fortifications were built along {{the east side of the}} park, including forts at what is now Marble Arch, Mount Street and Hyde Park Corner.

5|$|The first Celtic people {{arrived in}} Poland, coming from Bohemia and Moravia, around or after 400 BC, {{just a few}} decades after their La Tène culture was born. They formed several {{enclaves}} mostly {{in the southern part}} of the country, within the Pomeranian or Lusatian populations or in areas abandoned by those people. The cultures or groups that were Celtic, or had a Celtic element in them (mixed Celtic and autochthonous), lasted at their furthest extent to 170 AD (the Púchov culture). After the Celts moved in, and during their tenure (they had always remained only a small minority), the bulk of the population had begun acquiring the traits of archaeological cultures with a dominant Proto-Germanic or Germanic component. In Europe the expansion of Rome and the Germanic pressure <b>checked</b> <b>and</b> reversed the Celtic expansion.|$|E

40|$|Voters often {{dismantle}} constitutional <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances on the executive. If such <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances limit presidential {{abuses of}} power and rents, why do voters support their removal? We argue that by reducing politician rents, <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances also make it cheaper to bribe or in‡uence politicians through non-electoral means. In weakly-institutionalized polities where such non-electoral in‡uences, particularly by the better organized elite, are a major concern, voters may prefer a political system without <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances {{as a way of}} insulating politicians from these in‡uences. When they do so, they are e¤ectively accepting a certain amount of politician (presidential) rents in return for redistribution. We show that <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances are less likely to emerge when (equilibrium) politician rents are low; when the elite are better organized {{and are more likely to}} be able to in‡uence or bribe politicians; and when inequality and potential taxes are high (which makes redistribution more valuable to the majority). We show that the main intuition, that <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances, by making politicians “cheaper to bribe, ” are potentially costly to the majority, is valid under di¤erent ways of modeling the form of <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances...|$|R

5|$|In 1032, Barbolano {{himself was}} deposed {{by those who}} wished to restore power to Otto Orseolo, but the former Doge lay dying in Constantinople {{and was unable to}} return from exile. Domenico Orseolo, a younger brother of Otto and a rather unpopular figure in Venice, {{attempted}} to seize the throne without waiting for the formality of an election, but as soon as he tried this, his many enemies, including those who pushed for the reinstatement of Otto, grew outraged that an Orseolo would assume the throne simply because {{he was the son of}} Pietro II. The power of the Doge was severely <b>checked,</b> <b>and</b> Domenico Flabanico, a successful merchant, was called by the people to the position of Doge. During his 11-year reign Flabanico enacted several key reforms that would restrict the power of future Doges, including a law forbidding the election of a son of a Doge.|$|E
5|$|It was not {{possible}} to simply drive through the gap in the fence that existed at crossing points, as the East Germans installed high-impact vehicle barriers and mobile rolling barriers that could (and did) kill drivers that attempted to ram them. Vehicles were subjected to rigorous checks to uncover fugitives. Inspection pits and mirrors allowed the undersides of vehicles to be scrutinised. Probes were used to investigate the chassis and even the fuel tank, where a fugitive might be concealed, and vehicles could be partially dismantled in on-site garages. At Marienborn there was even a mortuary garage where coffins could be checked to confirm that the occupants really were dead. Passengers were <b>checked</b> <b>and</b> often interrogated about their travel plans and reasons for travelling. The system used simple technology and was slow, relying largely on vast card indexes recording travellers' details, but it was effective nonetheless; during the 28years of operation of the Marienborn complex, no successful escapes were recorded.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Napoleon had {{launched}} {{an attack on}} the main army at the Austrian center. Klenau's force stood on the immediate right flank of the center, opposite the attacking force of Lannes. The French cavalry, in reserve, prepared to move at either flank, or to the center, depending on where the Austrian line broke first. The French nearly broke through at the center but, at the last minute, Charles arrived with his last reserve, leading his soldiers with a color in his hand. Lannes was <b>checked,</b> <b>and</b> the impetus of the attack died out all along the line. In the final hours of the battle, Lannes himself was cut down by a cannonball from Klenau's artillery. Aspern was lost to the French. The Danube bridges upon which the French relied had been cut again by heavy barges, which the Austrians had released on the river. When he lost his route across the river, Napoleon at once suspended the attack. For his leadership at Essling, Klenau received the Commander's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa.|$|E

They were herded into a makeshift detention centre at a former rolling-stock factory. Once there, their papers were <b>checked</b> <b>and</b> their names entered into a ledger. When the camp was full, the Wehrmacht ordered groups of 100 prisoners to march to pre-dug mass graves, where they were executed with heavy machine guns. The bodies were then examined for any signs of life; victims that had survived the initial volley were dealt a single bullet to the head. Once the first group had been liquidated, the soldiers returned to the factory and collected the next 100 victims. This process continued until all the men that were rounded up had been killed.|$|E

5|$|Once the Act of Parliament was obtained, Edwards {{became the}} {{engineer}} for the project, and drew up the detailed plans, which Grundy and Smeaton <b>checked</b> <b>and</b> altered slightly, {{after which they}} had no further involvement with the scheme. Construction was started in April 1763, and the drainage element of the project, which included the sluice, was finished in 1768, having cost £42,000. Work on three locks and other work connected with navigation cost £6,000 and continued until 1771. The locks were located at Stamp End, Kirkstead and Barlings. The Grand Sluice was a major construction which maintained the height of water above Boston to near normal high tide level and had massive flood gates to cope with any tides above this. It was completed in 1766 and was effective in scouring the Haven below it and increasing silting of the river above it.|$|E
5|$|The killings were methodical. After the {{condemned}} individual's personal information was <b>checked</b> <b>and</b> approved, he was handcuffed {{and led to}} a cell insulated with stacks of sandbags along the walls, and a heavy, felt-lined door. The victim was told to kneel {{in the middle of the}} cell, and was then approached from behind by the executioner and immediately shot in the back of the head or neck. The body was carried out through the opposite door and laid in one of the five or six waiting trucks, whereupon the next condemned was taken inside and subjected to the same fate. In addition to muffling by the rough insulation in the execution cell, the pistol gunshots were also masked by the operation of loud machines (perhaps fans) throughout the night. Some post-1991 revelations suggest that prisoners were also executed in the same manner at the NKVD headquarters in Smolensk, though judging by the way that the corpses were stacked, some captives may have been shot while standing on the edge of the mass graves. This procedure went on every night, except for the public May Day holiday.|$|E
5|$|By 02:00 the Chinese attack {{had been}} <b>checked</b> <b>and</b> 3 RAR had redeployed to new {{positions}} in the paddy fields around the railway crossing north of Maenjung-dong. However, amid the confusion the exact dispositions of the companies remained unclear {{for the remainder of}} the night. Australian losses were 12 killed and 64 wounded, the same number as those suffered during their entire advance into North Korea. A number of officers of the battalion were later critical of the decision to withdraw while still engaged, believing that it had been both dangerous and unnecessary, while the lack of detailed planning, reconnaissance and orders were also seen as a factor in the disorganisation that ensued. While A Company had immediately withdrawn as ordered and had suffered a number of casualties in doing so, both B and D Companies, which were commanded by experienced veterans of the 2nd Australian Imperial Force, had delayed doing so until more favourable circumstances prevailed and fared better as a consequence. Yet the following morning a patrol from D Company cleared the abandoned A and B Company positions unopposed. The area was found littered with Chinese dead and equipment. Among the casualties were both Chinese and North Koreans, and it became clear that the Australians had been attacked by a mixed force, estimated at around 1,500 men. Many of those killed were also found to have been carrying demolition charges.|$|E
