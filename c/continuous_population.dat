5|$|The {{radiocarbon}} dating of the skeletal remains from 56 Beringian wolves showed a <b>continuous</b> <b>population</b> from over 50,800 YBP until 12,500YBP, followed by one wolf dated at 7,600YBP. This indicates that their population was in decline after 12,500YBP, although megafauna was still available {{in this region}} until 10,500YBP. The timing of this latter specimen {{is supported by the}} recovery of mammoth and horse DNA from sediments dated 10,500 YBP–7,600 YBP from the interior of Alaska. The timing for the extinction of horses in North America and the minimum population size for North American bison coincide with the extinction of an entire wolf haplogroup in North America, indicating that the disappearance of their prey caused the extinction of this wolf ecomorph. This resulted in a significant loss of phenotypic and genetic diversity within the species.|$|E

40|$|While habitat {{fragmentation}} is {{a central}} issue in forest conservation studies {{in the face of}} broad-scale anthropogenic changes to the environment, its effects on contemporary mating patterns remain controversial. This is partly because of the inherent variation in mating patterns which may exist within species and the fact that few studies have replication at the landscape level. To study the effect of forest fragmentation on contemporary mating patterns, including effective pollen dispersal, we compared four native populations of the Australian forest tree, Eucalyptus globulus. We used six microsatellite markers to genotype 1289 open-pollinated offspring from paired fragmented and <b>continuous</b> <b>populations</b> on the island of Tasmania and in Victoria on mainland Australia. The mating patterns in the two <b>continuous</b> <b>populations</b> were similar, despite large differences in population density. In contrast, the two fragmented populations were variable and idiosyncratic in their mating patterns, particularly in their pollen dispersal kernels. The <b>continuous</b> <b>populations</b> showed relatively high outcrossing rates (86 – 89...|$|R
40|$|Biogeographic models {{predict that}} {{marginal}} populations {{should be more}} geographically isolated and smaller than central populations, linked to more stressful conditions and likely also {{to a reduction in}} density of individuals, individual growth, survival and reproductive output. This variation in population features could have important consequences for different aspects of plant ecology such as individual reproductive success, population genetic structure or plant-animal interactions. In this study, we analyze if individuals of the evergreen shrub Daphne laureola at disjunt populations in a local border of its distribution area in southern Iberian Peninsula differ in individual size, shoot growth, reproductive output and the pollination environment from central <b>continuous</b> <b>populations</b> within the area. Plants of central <b>continuous</b> <b>populations</b> were larger and produced more ﬂowers and fruits than plants of marginal disjunct populations suggesting more optimal conditions, although they had lower annual shoot growth. In contrast, fruit set was higher in plants at the local border, suggesting a more efﬁcient pollinator service in these populations where the main pollinator in central <b>continuous</b> <b>populations,</b> the pollen beetle Meligethes elongatus, was not present. Our results do not support strong differences in the ecological stress between marginal disjunct and central <b>continuous</b> <b>populations</b> of D. laureola in the south of the Iberian Peninsula but indicate some changes in plant-pollinator interactions that could be relevant for the sexual polymorphism in this gynodioecious species.

500|$|Once it was {{discovered}} that gravid female Ormia depleta flies are attracted to the song of Neoscapteriscus males in South America, a path to trap these flies at synthetic mole cricket song was opened. Experimentation then led to a rearing method. Laborious rearing [...] of over 10,000 flies on mole cricket hosts allowed releases of living fly pupae at many sites in Florida from the far northwest to the far south, mainly on golf courses, and mainly in 1989-1991. Populations [...] were established, began to spread, and were monitored by use of synthetic mole cricket song. Eventually it {{was discovered}} that the flies had a <b>continuous</b> <b>population</b> from about 29 degrees North all the way south to Miami, but that the flies failed to survive the winter north of about 29 degrees. Shipment and release of the flies to states north of Florida was thus a wasted effort. As the flies had been imported from 23 degrees South in Brazil and could not overwinter north of 29 degrees North in Florida, it was investigated in 1999 whether flies from 30 degrees South in Brazil might survive better in northern Florida, but they did not.|$|E
500|$|This {{species was}} {{described}} by Linnaeus in 1758 {{and placed in the}} genus Ardea that included the larger herons. Edward Blyth published a monograph on the cranes in 1881 in which he considered the [...] "sarus crane" [...] of India to be made up of two species, Grus collaris and Grus antigone. Most modern authors recognize one species with three disjunct populations that were previously treated as subspecies, although the status of one extinct population from the Philippines is uncertain. The sarus cranes in India (previously of the sub-species antigone) are the largest, and in the east from Myanmar is replaced by a population that extends into Southeast Asia (previously of the sub-species sharpii). The sarus cranes from the Indian subcontinent are well marked and differentiated from the south-eastern population by having a white collar below the bare head and upper neck, and white tertiary remiges. The population in Australia (initially placed in sharpii (sometimes spelt sharpei but amended to conform to the rules of Latin grammar) was separated and named as the race gilliae, sometimes spelt gillae or even gilli), prior to a genetic analysis. Recent genetic analyses shows these three populations as representatives of a formerly <b>continuous</b> <b>population</b> that varies clinally. The Australian race was designated only in 1988, with the species itself first noticed in Australia in 1969 and regarded as a recent immigrant. Native Australians, however, differentiated the sarus and the brolga and called the sarus [...] "the crane that dips its head in blood". Sarus of the Australian population are similar to those in south-east Asia in having no white on the neck and tertiary remiges, but are distinguished by a larger grey patch of ear coverts. This population shows the most recent divergence from the ancestral form with an estimated 3000 generations of breeding within Australia. An additional subspecies luzonica was suggested for the population once found, but now extinct, in the Philippines. No distinctive character is known of this population.|$|E

40|$|Gene-flow {{has been}} studied in this {{research}} from an analytical, theoretical, and practical angle. While simple models of restricted gene-flow are tractable analytically and can produce very accurate predictions {{when compared with the}} results of computer simulations, models of discrete populations with geographical structure and models of <b>continuous</b> <b>populations</b> need further research. In particular, models of isolation by distance in a continuum are very difficult to relate to concepts familiar to the population geneticist since the basic concept linking <b>continuous</b> <b>populations</b> to discrete ones, the neighbourhood size, is shown to be flawed. Inferring gene-flow from indirect methods implies obtaining unbiased estimators of quantities such as F-statistics. The framework for estimation presented in this research can be used to derive unbiased estimators in different situations, and can also help to clarify the underlying assumptions made when making these estimates. In particular the conditions are specified under which Nei and Chesser's (1983) and Weir and Cockerham's (1984) estimators are most appropriate. While analytical treatment of geographically structured populations is difficult, F-statistics can be used to unravel levels of genetic structuring in these populations. Methods are presented which yield ways of discriminating between samples taken within and among breeding units, a necessary distinction if levels of gene-flow are to be inferred. Calculations of pairwise Fat, even in <b>continuous</b> <b>populations,</b> provide a picture of the geography of gene-flow in the population investigated.

40|$|International audienceThe local {{density of}} {{individuals}} is seldom uniform {{in space and}} time within natural populations. Yet, formal approaches to the process of isolation by distance in <b>continuous</b> <b>populations</b> have encountered analytical difficulties in describing genetic structuring with demographic heterogeneities, usually disregarding local correlations in the movement and reproduction of genes. We formulate exact recursions for probabilities of identity in <b>continuous</b> <b>populations,</b> from which we deduce definitions of effective dispersal (sigma(2) (e)) and effective density (D-e) that generalize results relating spatial genetic structure, dispersal and density in lattice models. The latter claim is checked in simulations where estimates of effective parameters obtained from demographic information are compared with estimates derived from spatial genetic patterns in a plant population evolving in a heterogeneous and dynamic habitat. The simulations further suggest that increasing spatio-temporal correlations in local density reduce sigma(2) (e) and generally decrease the product D-e sigma(2) (e), with dispersal kurtosis influencing their sensitivity to density fluctuations. As in the lattice model, the expected relationship between the product D-e sigma(2) (e) and the genetic structure statistic a(r) holds under fluctuating density, irrespective of dispersal kurtosis. The product D sigma(2) between observed census density and the observed dispersal rate over one generation will generally be an upwardly biased (up to 400 % in simulations) estimator of D-e sigma(2) (e) in populations distributed in spatially aggregated habitats...|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} a small {{isolated}} population of black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) in the Netherlands {{to examine the}} impact of isolation and reduction in numbers on genetic diversity. We compared the genetic diversity in the last extant Dutch population with Dutch museum samples and three other black grouse populations (from England, Austria and Norway, respectively) representing isolated and <b>continuous</b> <b>populations.</b> We found significantly lower allelic richness, observed and expected heterozygosities in the present Dutch population compared to the <b>continuous</b> <b>populations</b> (Austria and Norway) and also to the historical Dutch population. However, using a bottleneck test on each population, signs of heterozygosity excess were only found in the likewise isolated English population despite that strong genetic drift was evident in the present Dutch population in comparison to the reference populations, as assessed both in pairwise FST and structure analyses. Simulating the effect of a population reduction on the Dutch population from 1948 onwards, using census data and with the Dutch museum samples {{as a model for the}} genetic diversity in the initial population, revealed that the loss in number of alleles and observed heterozygosity was according to genetic drift expectations and within the standard error range of the present Dutch population. Thus, the effect of the strong decline in the number of grouse on genetic diversity was only detectable when using a reference from the past. The lack of evidence for a population reduction in the present Dutch population by using the program bottleneck was attributed to a rapidly found new equilibrium as a consequence of a very small effective population siz...|$|R
