It has been designed to work well with bounded model checking. It takes as inputs a Boolean circuit (e. g., the model unrolled k times) and an optional set of additional constraints (for instance, requesting that a solution correspond to a simple path) in the form of CNF clauses or BDDs. The algorithms in <b>CirCUs</b> take advantage of the mixed representation by applying powerful BDD-based implication algorithms, and decision heuristics that are objective-driven. <b>CirCUs</b> supports incremental SAT solving, early termination checks, and other analyses of the model that translate into SAT.

40|$|Abstract. <b>CirCUs</b> is a satisfiability solver {{that works}} on a {{combination}} of an And-Inverter-Graph (AIG), Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) clauses, and Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs). We show how BDDs are used by <b>CirCUs</b> to help in the solution of SAT instances given in CNF. Specifically, the clauses are sorted by solving a hypergraph linear arrangement problem. Then they are clustered by an algorithm that strives to avoid explosion in the resulting BDD sizes. If clustering results in a single diagram, the SAT instance is solved directly. Otherwise, search for a satisfying assignment is conducted on the original clauses, enhanced with information extracted from the BDDs. We also describe a new decision variable selection heuristic that is based on recognizing that the variables involved in a conflict clause are often best treated as a related group. We present experimental results that demonstrate Cir-CUs’s efficiency especially for medium-size SAT instances that are hard to solve by traditional solvers based on DPLL. ...|$|R
40|$|Sateen is a satisability solver that {{combines}} a propositional reasoning engine with theory-specic procedures. It uses the lazy approach {{that relies on}} incremental rene-ments of a propositional abstraction of the given formula during the enumeration of its solutions. Sateen deals with Integer Difference Logic (IDL), in which arithmetic atomic for-mulae constrain {{the difference between the}} values of pairs of integer variables. It is sufcient to rewrite each equality constraint (of the form x y = n) as the conjunction of two inequalities. However, if an equality constraint is negated, then the conjunction turns into a disjunction, which requires case splitting in the enumeration of the propo-sitional solutions. In contrast, Sateen is based on the approach of [3], which does not decompose equalities and their negations; rather, it converts the problem of checking satisability of a conjunction of arithmetic atomic formulae into a set of propositional satisability checkswhose cardinality is bounded by the number of strongly con-nected components (SCC) of a suitable constraint graph. Sateen has been upgraded to the new version of the propositional solver, <b>CirCUs</b> [2]. Sateen generates solutions to the Boolean variables and the numerical variables in the original formula if the problem is satisable. Sateen incrementally checks infeasibility of IDL constraints. If the partial assignments from propositional solver are satisable, Sateen nds implied atomic variables through theory propagation. In contrast to other solvers, Sateen performs equality theory propagation that searchs for implied atomic variabls from zero-slack SCCs. To check the feasibility of IDL constraints that contain disequality constraints, it generates a maximal clique with bounds for each variable. In the nal step, nite instantiation is performed for complete assignments. UNSAT Core is returned as a proof of infeasibility if the encoded SAT instance is unsatisable...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn Bounded Model Checking (BMC), {{the search}} for counterexamples of {{increasing}} lengths is translated into a sequence of satisfiability (SAT) checks. It is natural to try to exploit the similarity of these SAT instances by forwarding clauses learned during conflict analysis from one instance to the next. The methods proposed to identify clauses that remain valid fall into two categories: Those that are oblivious to the mechanism that generates the sequence of SAT instances and those that rely on it. In {{the case of a}} BMC run, it was observed by Strichman [O. Shtrichman. Pruning techniques for the SAT-based bounded model checking problem. In Correct Hardware Design and Verification Methods (CHARME 2001), pages 58 – 70, Livingston, Scotland, Sept. 2001. Springer. LNCS 2144] that those clauses learned during one SAT check that only depend on the structure of the model remain valid when checking for longer counterexamples. Eén and Sörensson [N. Eén and N. Sörensson. Temporal induction by incremental SAT solving. Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science, 89 (4), 2003. First International Workshop on Bounded Model Checking. [URL] pointed out that all learned clauses can be forwarded if the translation into SAT obeys commonly followed rules. Many clauses that are forwarded this way, however, are of little usefulness and may degrade performance. This paper presents an extension to Strichman's approach {{in the form of a}} more general criterion to filter conflict clauses that can be profitably forwarded to successive instances. This criterion, in particular, is still syntactic and quite efficient, but accounts for the presence of both primary and auxiliary objectives in the SAT instance. This paper also introduces a technique to distill clauses to be forwarded even though they fail the syntactic check. Distillation is a semantic approach that can be applied in general to incremental SAT, and often produces clauses that are independent of the primary objective, and hence remain valid for the remainder of the sequence of instances. In addition, distillation often improves the quality of the clauses, that is, their ability to prevent the examination of large regions of the search space. Experimental results obtained with the <b>CirCUs</b> SAT solver confirm the efficacy of the proposed techniques, especially for large, hard problems...|$|R
