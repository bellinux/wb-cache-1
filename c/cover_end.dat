50|$|A remake for the PlayStation 3, subtitled Majo to Suiri no Rondo (lit. The Rondo of the Witch and Deduction), was {{released}} by Alchemist on December 16, 2010. The release covers the original four games, and its features include a full HD rendition, all of the original soundtracks from the PC games, and full voice acting. Umineko no Naku Koro ni Chiru was similarly remade for the PlayStation 3, subtitled Shinjitsu to Gensō no Nocturne (lit. The Nocturne of the Truth and Illusions) and released by Alchemist on December 15, 2011. Both remakes were to be ported to the PlayStation Portable under the title Umineko no Naku Koro ni Portable (うみねこのなく頃にPortable), each to be released as two separate games. Rondo was split into Portable 1 (which covers Legend and Turn) and Portable 2 (which covers Banquet and Alliance), released on October 20 and November 17, 2011, respectively. Nocturne was to be split into Portable 3 (which was to <b>cover</b> <b>End</b> and Dawn), and Portable 4 (which was to cover Requiem and Twilight), but both games never came out.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented {{of changes in}} the parameters of ice phenomena on selected Polish lakes over the years 1961 – 2010 against the background of variations in the intensity of the North Atlantic Oscillation. The following features were analysed: the start and end of ice phenomena and ice cover, their duration, and the stability of ice cover at observation sites of the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management on lakes located in various physical-geographic regions. Multi-year tendencies of change in the ice parameters under study were identified. The most statistically significant negative trends were observed for the ending dates of ice phenomena and their duration. Changes in the ice characteristics in the different NAODJFM stages were determined {{on the basis of their}} deviations: between years with high (> 1. 7) and low (< – 1. 09) values of the winter NAO index, and from average values from the years 1961 – 2010. Changes in the intensity of the North Atlantic Oscillation affect all the parameters of ice phenomena except their starting dates.

40|$|Daily snow {{observation}} {{data from}} 672 stations in China, particularly the 296 stations with over 10 mean snow cover days (SCDs) {{in a year}} {{during the period of}} 1952 – 2010, are used in this study. We first examine spatiotemporal variations and trends of SCDs, snow cover onset date (SCOD), and snow <b>cover</b> <b>end</b> date (SCED). We then investigate the relationships of SCDs with number of days with temperature below 0  °C (TBZD), mean air temperature (MAT), and Arctic Oscillation (AO) index. The results indicate that years with a positive anomaly of SCDs for the entire country include 1955, 1957, 1964, and 2010, and  years with a negative anomaly of SCDs include 1953, 1965, 1999, 2002, and 2009. The reduced TBZD and increased MAT are the main reasons for the overall late SCOD and early SCED since 1952. This explains why only 12 % of the stations show significant shortening of SCDs, while 75 % of the stations show no significant change in the SCDs trends. Our analyses indicate that the distribution pattern and trends of SCDs in China are very complex and are not controlled by any single climate variable examined (i. e. TBZD, MAT, or AO), but a combination of multiple variables. It is found that the AO has the maximum impact on the shortening trends of SCDs in the Shandong peninsula, Changbai Mountains, Xiaoxingganling, and north Xinjiang, while the combined TBZD and MAT have the maximum impact on the shortening trends of SCDs in the Loess Plateau, Tibetan Plateau, and Northeast Plain...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the serious}} tasks in the {{construction}} planning was the site layout planning as it had a considerable effect on construction sites. However, in practice site layout planning was often ignored or overlooked due to its complexity. Project Managers often performed a site layout planning based on experience, ad-hoc rules and first-come-first-serve approach which may lead to inefficient site layouts that had {{a negative effect on}} construction projects. Therefore, the automated systems can be considered as the most effective methods to develop an efficient site layout as they fully covered all concerns that cannot be taken into account by manual methods. Although, a lot of automated site layout planning systems had been developed to support this serious planning task. However, they remained having serious limitations and drawbacks such as a single objective, integrating with regular facilities and site areas only, 2 D site layouts representation, inefficient approaches to reflect the dynamic nature of construction sites, ignoring space reuse and facilities relocation, equal area space search, generating static layout, did not <b>cover</b> <b>end</b> users’ requirements, highly complex for users, ignoring the user interaction and lacking of flexibility in the system design. This revealed the need to develop new automated systems to cover the limitations and drawbacks of the existing automated systems and offer the end users’ requirements. Furtherer more, the quantitative study of survey returned by twelve participations from the Egyptian sites guided this research to list the end users’ requirements. These results led to identifying MATrix LABoratory (MATLAB) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) as the suitable tool and technique to overcome the site layout planning limitations and shortcomings as well as offer the end users’ requirements. Therefore, this research had developed an automated dynamic site layout planning system (ASLS) which had positive impacts on the construction industry in terms of: (1) improving the site layout and space planning (2) maintaining the construction projects cost and time; (3) improving the overall safety of construction sites; and (4) protecting the surrounding environment. The automated system subjected to a validation process through two construction projects based in Egypt to examine its accuracy and effectiveness. The validation process results proved its accuracy and effectiveness in developing optimal site layouts for construction projects. In addition, an evaluation process was used to examine its functionality, completeness, performance, usability and user acceptance through functional (black-box) test, structural (white-box) test and users’ trial. The functional (black-box) and structural (white-box) tests results verified its completeness and performance. The users’ trial results indicated its usability in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction and revealed that it was acceptable to use and efficient as it saved time. This research concluded that the developed automated system (ASLS) was effective and outperformed existing automated systems in generating global site layouts while satisfying the layout constraints by offering a number of new capabilities. Furthermore, this research contributed to knowledge by creating an innovative dynamic space search method and formulation of a novel objective function that minimized the harmful effect of construction activity on the surrounding neighboring. Recommendation emerged from the research findings were used to suggest the integrating of the automated system with the Computer Aided Drafting (CAD) and Building Information Modelling (BIM) to facilitate the data exchange and provide the project stakeholder with different scenarios of site layout...|$|E
