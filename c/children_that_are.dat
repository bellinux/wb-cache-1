5|$|In the United States, {{only about}} 4% of {{patients}} with photosensitive disorders are reported to {{have been diagnosed with}} solar urticaria. Internationally, the number is slightly larger at 5.3%. Solar urticaria may occur in all races but studies monitoring 135 African Americans and 110 Caucasians with photodermatoses found that 2.2% of the African Americans had SU and 8% of the Caucasians had the disease showing that Caucasians {{have a better chance of}} getting the disease. Globably 3.1 per 100,000 people are affected and females are more likely to be affected than males. The age ranges anywhere from 5–70 years old, but the average age is 35 and cases have been reported with <b>children</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> still in infancy. Solar urticaria accounts for less than one percent of the many documented urticaria cases. To put that into a better perspective, since its first documented case in Japan in 1916, over one hundred other instances of the disease have been reported.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of <b>children</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> born {{to parents who}} are illegal immigrants fail {{to graduate from high}} school, averaging two fewer years of school than children of legal immigrants. Reasons for this under-performance are thought to include stress, pressure to work at a younger age, and not having the economic resources needed for higher education.|$|E
25|$|Vaccination offers {{ethical issues}} beyond the normal issues {{of a parent}} {{deciding}} on medical care for their children, as unvaccinated individuals may spread disease to people (especially children and the elderly) with weaker immune systems, and to individuals in whom the vaccine has not been effective. For this reason, even where not required by law some schools and doctors' surgeries have prohibited parents with unvaccinated children from enrolling. A further complication arises in emergency room and urgent care facilities, particularly those geared towards treating children as an unvaccinated child is often brought to these facilities after acquiring the disease and showing symptoms. Other <b>children</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> in the facility with compromised immune systems are then exposed. Mandatory vaccination also raises ethical issues regarding parental rights and informed consent.|$|E

500|$|The {{story is}} told {{from the point of}} view of Sov Thade Tage em Ereb, a {{teenager}} who lives in a large communal home in the Karhidish city of Rer. The 140 people in the house are all a single family. None of its members form long-lasting marital bonds (known on Gethen as [...] "keeping kemmer"); instead, individuals go to a communal [...] "kemmerhouse" [...] when they are sexually receptive, and any <b>children</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> conceived are raised in the [...] "hearth", or communal home. As a result, Sov grows up among a number of cousins and siblings, none of whom know who their sire is.|$|E
500|$|Children {{are also}} trafficked out of Haiti by {{organizations}} {{claiming to be}} adoption agencies, into countries including the US—but some are actually kidnapped from their families. [...] This practice was particularly widespread in the chaos following the 2010 earthquake. While women migrants were vulnerable during this time, the situation of children was underscored because of the phenomenon of irregular adoptions (one facet of human trafficking) of supposed “orphans” through the Dominican Republic. [...] International outcry arose when on January 29, 2010, ten members of the American New Life Children's Refuge were arrested trying to take 33 Haitian children {{out of the country}} to an orphanage—but the children were not orphans. Traffickers pretending to be workers from legitimate charitable organizations have been known to trick refugee families, convincing them that their children would be taken to safety and cared for. [...] In some cases, traffickers run [...] "orphanages" [...] or [...] "care facilities" [...] for <b>children</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> difficult to distinguish from legitimate organizations. [...] Children may be smuggled across the border by paid traffickers claiming to be their parents and subsequently forced into laboring for begging rings or as servants. [...] Child trafficking spurred Unicef to fund the Brigade de Protection des Mineurs, a branch of the national police that exists to monitor cases of child trafficking, to watch borders and refugee camps for such activity. [...] Children in refugee camps are in particular danger of other kinds of trafficking as well, including sexual exploitation.|$|E

2500|$|From an {{evolutionary}} perspective, men are theorized {{to maximize their}} fitness by investing {{as little as possible}} in their offspring and producing as many offspring as possible, due to the risk of males investing in <b>children</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not theirs. Women, who do not face the risk of cuckoldry, are theorized to maximize their fitness by investing as much as possible in their offspring because they invest at least nine months of resources towards their offspring in pregnancy. Maximizing female fitness is theorized to require males in the relationship to invest all their resources in the offspring. These conflicting strategies are theorized to have resulted in selection of different jealousy mechanisms that are designed to enhance the fitness of the respective gender.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{article titled}} [...] "The Hillary Doctrine", {{published}} in The Atlantic in January 2013 by journalist David Rohde, {{talks about the}} terms of exchanges between Clinton and other American politicians within discussions of dilemmas concerning the United States and certain African countries. This time, Clinton explicitly called out actions taken by the United States abroad, and argued that, contrary to popular belief, [...] "a lot of the challenges we face are not immediately – or sustainably – solved by military action alone." [...] Further, while the aforementioned doctrine focuses on populations, such as women and <b>children,</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> typically ignored within discussions of national security, Clinton also makes an effort to push for including places that have historically been ignored within national security discussions, as well. However, Rohde never mentions the phrase [...] "Hillary Doctrine" [...] in the piece, {{and it could have}} been the creation of the magazine's headline writer.|$|E
2500|$|War rape {{can have}} an equally strong and {{long-term}} effect on the <b>children</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> born {{as a result of}} rape. On the one hand, these children may not be immediately identified and might find out about their origins only at a later point in their lives. In turn, if the children themselves but even more their environment knows about the 'war babies', they risk being regarded as 'other' by the communities they are born into. Recurring patterns in countries including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Uganda, Sierra Leone and Rwanda show how children born of war rape and to mothers who don't want them have to face struggles with regard to issues related to identity - both in an administrative as well as in a personal sense - and are sometimes restricted in their rights to education, non-discrimination and even physical security. [...] Unwanted children born of rape are potentially more vulnerable in a psychological as well as in a physical way and cases of abandoned children are reported from various contemporary conflict and post-conflict societies.|$|E
2500|$|One of Piaget's {{most famous}} studies focused purely on the discriminative {{abilities}} of {{children between the}} ages of two and a half years old, and four and a half years old. He began the study by taking children of different ages and placing two lines of sweets, one with the sweets in a line spread further apart, and one with the same number of sweets in a line placed more closely together. He found that, [...] "Children between 2 years, 6 months old and 3 years, 2 months old correctly discriminate the relative number of objects in two rows; between 3 years, 2 months and 4 years, 6 months they indicate a longer row with fewer objects to have [...] "more"; after 4 years, 6 months they again discriminate correctly" [...] (Cognitive Capacity of Very Young Children, p.141). Initially younger children were not studied, because if at four years old a child could not conserve quantity, then a younger child presumably could not either. The results show however that <b>children</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> younger than three years and two months have quantity conservation, but as they get older they lose this quality, and do not recover it until four and a half years old. This attribute may be lost due to a temporary inability to solve because of an overdependence on perceptual strategies, which correlates more candy with a longer line of candy, or due to the inability for a four-year-old to reverse situations.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2010, Sanger wrote {{a letter}} to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, {{outlining}} his concerns that two categories of images on Wikimedia Commons contained child pornography, and were in violation of US federal obscenity law. Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to pedophilia and one about lolicon, were not of real children, but said that they constituted [...] "obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children", under the PROTECT Act of 2003. That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of <b>children</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> obscene under American law. Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools. Wikimedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation, saying that Wikipedia did not have [...] "material we would deem to be illegal. If we did, we would remove it." [...] Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community. After some editors who volunteer to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status. He wrote in a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list that this action was [...] "in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted". Critics, including Wikipediocracy, noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared.|$|E
