500|$|The {{play has}} {{received}} modest reviews. Julian Hall of The Independent criticized {{it for a}} lack of inside stories about The Simpsons, writing that [...] "Cartwright never allows you to become bored but that means some issues are skirted over faster than American closing credits on television. You never really get a feel what it is like recording the show." [...] Brian Logan of The Guardian described Cartwright as [...] "a lively host [...] eager to please", but found the play to be [...] "an overweeningly upbeat collection of Simpsons chitchat." [...] David Chatterton of British Theatre Guide described it as [...] "interesting and entertaining, but not really a 'must see' even for Simpsons fans." [...] Clive Davis of The Times wrote that [...] "In contrast to The Simpsons itself, where not a line, not a syllable, goes to waste, Cartwright has a habit of losing herself in anecdotes that stumble into dead-ends. [...] The half-hearted trivia quiz involving volunteers from the audience soon dies a death too. The performance really <b>cries</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a hard-headed director. The video clips of Cartwright at large are fun, however." ...|$|E
500|$|Santiago Fouz-Hernández {{wrote in}} his book, Madonna's Drowned Worlds, that the Black woman who catches Madonna when she is falling through heaven in her dream, is a symbol for the divinity, as she helps Madonna {{throughout}} the video {{to come to the}} correct decision. Fouz-Hernández explained how the physical similarity between Madonna and woman indicated that it was actually Madonna's inner divinity which was rescuing her. When the singer accidentally cuts her hand on the dagger, it was described as receiving stigmata by scholar Robert McQueen Grant, who believed that the scene marked Madonna as having an important role to play in the narrative. This was evident when the crime scene is shown in detail, and an identification is established between Madonna and the victim. Freya Jarman-Ivens, coauthor with Fouz-Hernández, noted that the woman <b>cries</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> help when Madonna sings the line [...] "When you call my name, It's like a little prayer". However, Madonna could not do anything thus portraying failure of divinity to save. Jarman-Ivens also noted the look between the gang member and Madonna, which she thought was a complicity of [...] "White men rape/kill women, white men blame it on Black men; Women are raped/killed for being on the streets at night, Black men are nevertheless thrown in jail." ...|$|E

Sir Roderic duly appears, recognises his former love and, angered that his former fiancée has been abducted, dismisses Robin. [...] Left alone, he and Dame Hannah enjoy a brief reunion.

He quibbles that, {{under the terms}} of the curse, a Baronet of Ruddigore can die only by refusing to commit a daily crime.

Her description in the poem is also related to Isis of Apuleius's Metamorphoses, but Isis was a figure of redemption and the Abyssinian maid <b>cries</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> her demon-lover.

The young Prince of Tartary is overjoyed at seeing Timur alive, but still urges Timur to not speak his name because he is afraid that the Chinese rulers, who have conquered Tartary, may kill or harm them. Timur then tells his son that, of all his servants, only Liù has remained faithful to him. When the Prince asks her why, she tells him that once, long ago in the palace, the Prince had smiled at her (Trio with chorus – The crowd, Liù, Prince of Tartary, Timur: Indietro, cani! – [...] "Back, dogs!").|$|E

2500|$|What {{follows is}} a series of musical numbers {{performed}} by the principal characters, each exploring their biggest desires. The two younger couples sing in counterpoint of their hopes for the future ("You're Gonna Love Tomorrow/Love Will See Us Through"). Buddy then appears, dressed in [...] "plaid baggy pants, garish jacket and a shiny derby hat", and performs a high-energy vaudeville routine depicting how he is caught between his love for Sally and Margie's love for him. ("The God-Why-Don't-You-Love-Me Blues"). Sally appears next, dressed as a torch singer, singing of her passion for Ben from the past- and her obsession with him now ("Losing My Mind"). In a jazzy dance number, accompanied by a squadron of chorus boys, Phyllis reflects on the two sides of her personality, one naive and passionate and the other jaded and sophisticated and her desire to combine them ("The Story of Lucy and Jessie"). [...] Resplendent in top hat and tails, Ben begins to offer his devil-may-care philosophy ("Live, Laugh, Love"), but stumbles and anxiously calls to the conductor for the lyrics, as he frantically tries to keep going. Ben becomes frenzied, while the dancing ensemble continues as if nothing was wrong. Amidst a deafening discord, Ben screams at all the figures from his past and collapses as he <b>cries</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> Phyllis.|$|E
2500|$|Wagner {{uses the}} metaphor of Day and Night in the second act to {{designate}} the realms inhabited by Tristan and Isolde. The world of Day {{is one in which}} the lovers are bound by the dictates of King Marke's court and in which the lovers must smother their mutual love and pretend as if they do not care for each other: it is a realm of falsehood and unreality. Under the dictates of the realm of Day, Tristan was forced to remove Isolde from Ireland and to marry her to his Uncle Marke – actions against Tristan's secret desires. The realm of Night, in contrast, is the representation of intrinsic reality, in which the lovers can be together and their desires can be openly expressed and reach fulfilment: it is the realm of oneness, truth and reality and can only be achieved fully upon the deaths of the lovers. The realm of Night, therefore, becomes also the realm of death: the only world in which Tristan and Isolde can be as one forever, and it is this realm that Tristan speaks of at the end of act 2 ("Dem Land das Tristan meint, der Sonne Licht nicht scheint"). In act 3, Tristan rages against the daylight and frequently <b>cries</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> release from his desires (Sehnen). In this way, Wagner implicitly equates the realm of Day with Schopenhauer's concept of Phenomenon and the realm of Night with Schopenhauer's concept of Noumenon. While none of this is explicitly stated in the libretto, Tristan's comments on Day and Night in acts 2 and 3, as well as musical allusions to Tristan in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg and Parsifal make it very clear that this was, in fact, Wagner's intention.|$|E
2500|$|In Nature and Human Nature (Houghton Mifflin, 1892), [...] "Emerson {{treats the}} efforts {{that men have}} made to {{interpret}} the world through art. She discusses first the ideals in men's minds, then the various forms {{in which they have}} sought to embody these, – in music, painting, sculpture, and architecture. A specially interesting interpretation is given of landscape painting and Gothic architecture, with reference to the spiritual qualities which give significance to pictures and buildings. The Dial was less complimentary in its review of Nature and Human Nature stating: A desire to cover too large a field is apparent in Mrs. Ellen Russell Emerson’s “Nature and Human Nature” (Houghton). Literature, language, and art, including music, also come in for discussion. In her treatment of art, and symbolism in art, the author shows herself most at home, despite an occasional fanciful idea or far-fetched analogy. Her interpretation of the Laocoön as suggesting, in the serpents’ undulating folds, “the gliding stanchless waves of the sea, against whose onward movement there is no barrier,” is new to us. Were Poseidon the offended divinity in the case, this reading of the symbol would be more plausible. But the temptation to subtilize on art, as Lessing says in his “Laokoon,” sometimes leads one into whimsical theories. As an interpreter of nature, Mrs. Emerson is helpful. Passing to letters, she asserts that when a poet willingly becomes a translator of another's verse, he thereby stands confessed as a minor poet. Hence she refuses to recognize Longfellow and Bryant as great poets. Leaving Pope out of the account, does she forget that Goethe and Schiller and Browning also tried their hand at translating ? Or would she deny greatness to them as well? Evidently not; for she afterwards speaks of Browning in the same breath with Shakespeare, ascribing to both the “balance of heart and brain.” that marks the true poet. The writer's thought, it must be said in conclusion, suffers for lack of terseness and incisiveness in its presentation. We choose, almost at random, a sentence that <b>cries</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the pruning-knife, – “Interpretation of the sublimity of an uplift of rock, forest, and tableland is product of a vision dependent on the soul's sight, and sublimity is not more intrinsic to mountainous scenery than is color to a garden of flowers.” The Gallicism in the following is so harsh, and so unnecessary, as to merit censure, – “Scientific discovery, indeed, has laid its axe to the root of many errors, and among which the error of self-importance is not the least conspicuous.” May linguistic discovery soon lay its axe to the root of this error of speech ! A number of new or little-used words, as “sculptuary” (i.g. sculpture), “bolide,” “landscapist,” are encountered in Mrs. Emerson's pleasant pages." ...|$|E
