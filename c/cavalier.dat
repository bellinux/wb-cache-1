5|$|The {{history of}} the breed in America is {{relatively}} recent. The first recorded <b>Cavalier</b> living in the United States was brought from the United Kingdom in 1956 by W. Lyon Brown, together with Elizabeth Spalding and other enthusiasts, she founded the <b>Cavalier</b> King Charles Club USA which continues to the present day. In 1994, the American <b>Cavalier</b> King Charles Spaniel Club was created {{by a group of}} breeders to apply for recognition by the American Kennel Club.

5|$|As {{many as half}} of all <b>Cavalier</b> King Charles Spaniels {{may have}} a {{congenital}} blood disorder called idiopathic asymptomatic thrombocytopenia, an abnormally low number of platelets in the blood, according to recent studies in Denmark and the United States. Platelets, or thrombocytes, are disk-shaped blood elements which aid in blood clotting. Excessively low numbers {{are the most common}} cause of bleeding disorders in dogs. The platelets in the blood of many <b>Cavalier</b> King Charles Spaniels are a combination of those of normal size for dogs and others that are abnormally oversized, or macrothrombocytes. Macrothrombocytosis also is a congenital abnormality found in at least a third of CKCSs. These large platelets function normally, and the typical <b>Cavalier</b> does not appear to experience any health problems due to either the size or fewer numbers of its platelets.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Cavalier</b> King Charles changed inordinately in {{the late}} 17th century, when it was interbred with flat-nosed breeds.

5|$|The King Charles Spaniel is {{less popular}} than the <b>Cavalier</b> {{in both the}} UK and the US.

Due to the low number of registrations, the King Charles was identified as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club in 2003 in an effort to help promote the breed.|$|E

5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} (HD) is {{a common}} genetic disease that affects <b>Cavalier</b> King Charles Spaniels. It is not present at birth but develops with age.

In a series of evaluations by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, the <b>Cavalier</b> was ranked 78th worst out of 157 breeds. The worst affected breeds were the Bulldog, Pug and Dogue de Bordeaux.|$|E

5|$|The King Charles Spaniel and {{the other}} types of toy spaniels were {{crossbred}} with the Pug in the early 19th century {{to reduce the size}} of the nose, as was the style of the day. The 20th century saw attempts to restore lines of King Charles Spaniels to the breed of Charles II's time. These included the unsuccessful Toy Trawler Spaniel and the now popular <b>Cavalier</b> King Charles Spaniel. The <b>Cavalier</b> is slightly larger, with a flat head and a longer nose, while the King Charles is smaller, with a domed head and a flat face.|$|E

5|$|The Second World War {{caused a}} drastic setback to the {{emerging}} breed, with {{the vast majority of}} breeding stock destroyed because of wartime hardship and food shortages. For instance, in the Ttiweh <b>Cavalier</b> Kennel, the population of sixty dogs dropped to three during the 1940s. Following the war, just six dogs would survive as the new beginning from which all present-day Cavaliers descend. These dogs were Ann's Son, his litter brother Wizbang Timothy, Carlo of Ttiweh, Duce of Braemore, Kobba of Kuranda and Aristide of Ttiweh. The numbers increased gradually, and in 1945 the Kennel Club first recognised the breed in its own right as the <b>Cavalier</b> King Charles Spaniel.|$|E
