To pacify the revolt, Prime minister Emilio Colombo offered to build the Fifth Steelwork Centre in Reggio including a railroad stump and the port in Gioia Tauro, an investment of 3 billion lire which would create 10,000 jobs, which softened the people of Reggio Calabria. This so-called [...] "Colombo package" [...] was developed as a <b>compensatory</b> <b>measure</b> for Reggio Calabria's failure to be designated as the regional capital.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to compare {{different}} maintenance costs of ecosystem service arising from a hypothetical case of environmental damage in order to help to understand how the different ecosystem services are considered in decision making processes. <b>Compensatory</b> <b>measures</b> are aimed precisely at maintaining the level of supply of ecosystem services. According to the literature, <b>compensatory</b> <b>measures</b> like restoration are usually applied to specific ecosystem services. We used the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) categories of ecosystem service. For each MEA category, several ecological indicators are selected, and the cost of the <b>compensatory</b> <b>measures</b> required to fulfill the goal of no net loss is assessed using the Habitat Equivalency Analysis (HEA). The results of this analysis highlight differences between <b>compensatory</b> <b>measures</b> and their associated costs depending on the category of ecosystem services targeted. Maintenance costs are high for regulating services, low for provisioning services, and more difficult to determine for cultural services (high or low depending on the indicator selected). We discuss the implications of this result, noting that it is more rational for project developers to focus their attention on provisioning services if the legal regulation of compensation is lax or if indicators relative to cultural and regulating services are not precise enough...|$|R

In an attempt to elucidate its response to cerebrospinal fluid leakage, male young adult Wistar rats were subjected to lumbar spinal transection under intraperitoneal Nembutal anaesthesia. Control animals received a sham operation, involving opening up the cerebrospinal fluid space and its closure. A scanning electron microscopical study of the third ventricular ependyma on the seventh postoperative day revealed pronounced surface modifications in the experimental animal which included (i) bulbous dilatations in the ciliary shafts with frequent apical blebbing, and an overall turgid appearance of most cilia; (ii) a profusion of tall and stout microvilli in the non-ciliated zones; (iii) {{an increase in the}} size and number of blebs; and (iv) a greater number of supraependymal cells especially on the ventricular floor.

40|$|Maternal hormones are an {{excellent}} pathway for the mother to influence offspring development, and birds provide exceptional opportunities to study these hormone-mediated maternal effects. Two dominant hypotheses about the function of yolk androgens in avian eggs concern maternal manipulation of sibling competition and post hatching paternal care. In megapodes, however, neither sibling competition nor post hatching parental care exists. Eggs are incubated by external heat sources, and chicks dig themselves out of their underground nest and live independently of their parents and their siblings. In this first study on egg androgens of such a megapode, the Australian Brush-turkey Alectura lathami, we found nevertheless substantial amounts of maternal androgens. Since size of the incubation mound, incubation temperature, egg size and laying date greatly vary in this species, we analysed variation in testosterone (T), androstenedione (A 4) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in relation to these factors. T concentrations were significantly higher in eggs from bigger mounds and laid at greater depth, which may compensate via anabolic effects for the longer duration and higher energetic requirements of chicks when digging themselves out. T concentrations were higher in smaller eggs, and both yolk A 4 and T concentrations increased with laying date, perhaps as a <b>compensatory</b> <b>measure,</b> while DHT concentrations only varied across different mounds. These results indicate that maternal androgens may influence offspring development outside the contexts of sibling competition or parental care. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

We investigated the relationship between RNA integrity and array quality on the commonly used Affymetrix Gene 1. 0 ST array platform using reliable within-array and between-array quality assessment measures. The possibility of a transcript specific bias in the apparent effect of RNA degradation on the measured gene expression signal was evaluated after either excluding quality-flagged arrays or compensation for RNA degradation at different steps in the analysis. Results: Using probe-level and inter-array quality metrics to assess 34 Gene 1. 0 ST array datasets derived from historical, paired tumour and normal primary colorectal cancer samples, 7 arrays (20. 6 %), with a mean sample RIN of 3. 2 (SD = 0. 42), were flagged during array quality assessment while 10 arrays from samples with RINs < 7 passed quality assessment, including one sample with a RIN < 3.

40|$|This thesis proposes and {{implements}} {{methods for}} the autonomous identification and classification of disturbances that have {{negative effects on}} a robot’s performance (self-diagnosis), and the autonomous selection of suitable compensatory actions (self-compensation). The proposed methods have been implemented in a walking hexapod robot provided {{with a number of}} sensors. Both, the robot’s sensorial information and a quantitative measure of the robot’s performance are obtained. This information is used for detecting, identifying and classifying obstructive conditions that have a strong impact on the robot’s performance. Once the cause of a lack of progress in the robot’s mission has been identified, suitable compensatory actions are found, executed and recorded. Then, when previously experienced detrimental situations arise, the associated <b>compensatory</b> <b>measures</b> are immediately taken without involving a searching process. As a result, the recovery from abnormal conditions is accelerated and the robot can promptly continue with its mission. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, different sets of experiments addressing the robot’s hardware faults, abnormal situations generated in the robot’s environment and a combination of both, were conducted. Results were evaluated by means of two indicators: the number of attempts before a correct identification of the robot’s hardware fault was achieved, and a discrepancy measure. The latter indicates the Euclidean distance between the centroid of an abnormal situation experienced by the robot and the centroid of abnormal situations incorporated into the robot’s database of anomalies. Results showed a good identification rate inside the repertoire of considered abnormal situations. Among the <b>compensatory</b> <b>measures</b> addressed in this thesis, an adaptable gait generation algorithm which allows legged robots to walk in a stable fashion after they have shed a variable number of legs, and a compact leg release mechanism that provides legged robots with a method for the autonomous physical ejection of damaged legs without requiring extra motors, are proposed. Two self-compensating methods (Autonomous Generated <b>Compensatory</b> <b>Measures</b> and Learned Compensating Measures) not implemented into the experimental robot are proposed in this thesis. In theory, these methods will allow robots to autonomously generate <b>compensatory</b> <b>measures</b> and learn from previously encountered abnormal situations. The methods developed in this research are fundamental for the autonomous detection of a robot’s failures and adaptability to unforeseen features of the robot’s environment. By using these techniques, it is expected to increase resilience to damage, extend lifespan and improve autonomy in robotic missions where human intervention is difficult or impossible, such as in extra-terrestrial exploration or other remote hostile environments...|$|R
