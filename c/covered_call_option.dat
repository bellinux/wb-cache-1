40|$|MBA - WBSInvestors {{need to be}} {{informed}} about the return characteristics of various option strategies in order to benefit from additional investment opportunities provided by options. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine, from a historical perspective, the return, and associated risk, of using fully <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> <b>option</b> and protective put option strategies with the underlying portfolio of selected shares from the JSE Securities Exchange, South Africa (JSE). The objective of this study is to consider two option strategies - the covered call strategy and the protective put strategy. The former strategy involves writing a call option and buying the underlying stock, while the latter involves buying a put whilst holding underlying stock. The study compares the performance of the two strategies in a global investment strategy which combines diversification and hedging to the performance of a stock portfolio without options. The results from this study provide investment options and strategies across various levels of risk aversion while still maintaining a diversified portfolio. The stocks chosen were the top 40 listed shares on the JSE, measured by market capitalisation, and hypothesis testing was used to illustrate the differences in performance between portfolios. Results from this study showed that the combination of the underlying stocks with a fully <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> <b>option</b> strategy leads to returns similar to those of a portfolio of underlying stocks only, but the risk, as measured by standard deviation, is lower on a portfolio with fully covered call options when compared to a portfolio of underlying stocks only. Combining the underlying portfolio with a protective put options strategy lowers the returns compared to those of a portfolio of the underlying stocks only...|$|E
40|$|Various {{explanations}} for the popularity of <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> <b>option</b> strategies have been explored in the literature. According to Shefrin and Statman [1993], framing and risk aversion can help justify its attractiveness to investors. Applying prospect theory and hedonic framing, these authors predict that {{in a world of}} frame dependence an investor that is sufficiently risk averse in the domain of gains will prefer a covered call position over a stock only position and that certain covered call designs will be preferred despite identical cash flows. To date, the relationship among framing, risk aversion, and covered call writing has not been empirically tested. We gather empirical evidence to complete this gap in the literature. We find highly significant empirical evidence for a pronounced framing effect with respect to different covered call designs with equal net cash flows as well as covered calls in general. We find only scarce empirical evidence for a relationship between risk aversion in the domain of gains and a preference for covered calls. In order to observe a positive relationship between risk aversion and covered call writing, investors with above average risk aversion seem to be required. Arvid O. I. Hoffmann and E. Tobias S.

5000|$|Investors {{have used}} exchange-listed options {{to engage in}} buy-write {{strategies}} since the 1970s, and descriptive articles {{were published in the}} The Journal of Portfolio Management in 1978 by Henry Pounds and in 1980 by Yates and Kopprasch (see references section below). However, prior to 2002 there was no major benchmark for buy-write strategies. To help {{in the development of the}} CBOE S&P 500 BuyWrite Index (ticker BXM), the Chicago Board Options Exchange commissioned Professor Robert Whaley of Vanderbilt University to compile and analyze relevant data from the time period from June 1988 through December 2001.

40|$|A <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> {{is a long}} {{position}} in a security and a short position in a <b>call</b> <b>option</b> on that security. Equity index <b>covered</b> <b>calls</b> are an attractive strategy to many investors because they have realized returns not much {{lower than those of}} the equity market but with much lower volatility. However, a number of myths about the strategy—from why it works to why an investor should or should not invest—have surfaced, {{and many of them are}} erroneously considered “common knowledge. ” The authors review the underlying risk and returns of <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> strategies and dispel eight common myths about them. A <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> is a combination of a long posi-tion in a security and a short position in a <b>call</b> <b>option</b> on the same security.

40|$|Writing <b>call</b> <b>options</b> against long {{positions}} in the underlying equities {{is the most popular}} options strategy. Since the variance is an inadequate measure of risk for options strategies, this paper uses a range of dominance criteria and four utility functions to compare the performance of partly and fully <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> strategies with that of the underlying equity portfolio. It is found that the dominance criteria are ineffective in choosing between strategies. However, all four utility functions (representing different combinations of absolute and relative risk aversion) find that the <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> strategy is preferable for the data period studied, supporting the widespread use of this strategy. <b>Call</b> <b>Options,</b> <b>Covered</b> <b>Calls,</b> Buy-writes, Overwrites,...|$|R
40|$|The {{empirical}} {{performance of}} <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> writing is quite puzzling {{in the traditional}} finance framework. <b>Covered</b> <b>call</b> writing is typically a risk reducing strategy so its expected return should be less than the expected return on the underlying in an efficient market. However, recent empirical evidence suggests (covering a period from 1988 onwards) that the <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> writing has nearly the same return as the underlying whereas the standard deviation of returns is considerably less. Market professionals consider a <b>call</b> <b>option</b> to be a surrogate for the underlying. Such mental accounting of a <b>call</b> <b>option</b> with the underlying has strong support in laboratory experiments.

40|$|This study {{examines}} QQQ <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> strategies from January 2002 through January 2012 and finds that downside risk-adjusted returns are attractive both on an absolute basis and relative {{to those of}} long QQQ positions. The study then presents a framework that partitions <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> positions into delta-neutral short call and long equity positions, which highlights the separability of decisions about delta-neutral short option and long equity exposure within a broader class of short call strategies that includes <b>covered</b> <b>calls.</b> The study then demonstrates that selling QQQ <b>call</b> <b>options</b> and buying QQQ shares on a delta-neutral basis, both without and with delta rebalancing, offers attractive risk–reward tradeoffs. The study then constructs out-of-sample implied volatility fitted values and examines the performance of <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> and delta-neutral short call strategies when estimates indicate that implied volatility is more overpriced than usual.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} a strawman {{proposal for}} ensuring electricity supply adequacy {{by means of}} contracting obligations imposed on load serving entities (LSE). The mandatory contracts {{take the form of}} physically <b>covered</b> back stop <b>call</b> <b>options</b> with a high strike price so as not to interfere with normal risk management practices. These <b>call</b> <b>options</b> which can be covered by existing capacity, new investment in generation, or curtailable load contracts are of one year duration and a two year lead time so as to enable new entrant participation. The obligation, which is based on forecasted peak load plus adequate planning reserves, can be met with any forward or option contract that meets the physical cover requirement, has the same delivery period, and has a strike or forward price at or below the backstop strike price. The proposed mechanisms is intended to facilitate smooth transition to an energy only market where voluntary bilateral contracting and spot prices provide the needed incentives for adequate investment in generation capacity. We also describe a central procurement alternative that alleviates the credit problems associated with carrying long term option contracts.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} performance of the fully <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> strategy both theoretically and empirically. In the first essay, using standard Black-Scholes assumptions, we show that the expected return and standard deviation of the <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> strategy are smaller than those of the underlying equity, either in instantaneous case or over a finite time horizon. Next, we show theoretically that the <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> for a set of out of the money strike prices could outperform a buy and hold strategy if Sharpe ratio is used as the measure to rank and choose portfolios. This seemingly contradictory result to the finance theory comes from the inappropriate use of Sharpe ratio when the return is non-normally distributed. The <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> strategy does not dominate the buy and hold strategy any more when using alternative performance measure that accounts for the downside risk. A Monte Carlo study confirms these results. ^ In the second essay, a few empirical tests are conducted. The first study uses simulated call prices and the results show that the out-of-the-money <b>covered</b> <b>call</b> strategy outperforms the buy and hold strategy in various market conditions between 1969 and 1999. This surprising result is further confirmed by another empirical analysis that uses actual option price data from 1998 to 2002. The implication is that the <b>call</b> <b>option</b> contracts might be overpriced in the market. ...|$|R

40|$|A trading {{strategy}} is developed {{to evaluate the}} market profitability of four different pricing models in detecting under-priced <b>call</b> <b>options.</b> Included in the evaluation are the Black-Scholes Model and three binomial lattice models implemented on parallel computers.
