50|$|A {{liquid state}} machine (LSM) is a {{particular}} kind of spiking neural network. An LSM consists of a large <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> (called nodes, or neurons). Each node receives time varying input from external sources (the inputs) as well as from other nodes. Nodes are randomly connected to each other. The recurrent nature of the connections turns the time varying input into a spatio-temporal pattern of activations in the network nodes. The spatio-temporal patterns of activation are read out by linear discriminant units.|$|E
50|$|In a {{military}} context, a command is a <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> and formations {{under the control}} of a single officer. Although during the Second World War a Command was also a name given to a battle group in the US Army, in general it is an administrative and executive strategic headquarters which is responsible to the national government or the national military headquarters. It is not uncommon for a nation's services to each consist of their own command (such as Land Component, Air Component, Naval Component, and Medical Component in the Belgian Army), but this does not preclude the existence of commands which are not service-based.|$|E
