The typical sanction is to order the advertiser to stop its illegal acts, or to include disclosure of additional information that serves to avoid the chance of deception. <b>Corrective</b> <b>advertising</b> may be mandated, {{but there are no}} fines or prison time except for the infrequent instances when an advertiser refuses to stop despite being ordered to do so.|$|E

The prospectus, claimed Truth About Motorways, was misleading {{with regard to the}} number of cars that would use the road and sought an order compelling the publication of <b>corrective</b> <b>advertising.</b> Such action they claimed was misleading per the Trade Practises Act.|$|E
5000|$|The Federal Trade Commission made a {{statement}} that Chevron had deceived consumers {{on the effectiveness of}} their gas additive F-310. The FTC was going to conduct a <b>corrective</b> <b>advertising</b> campaign to disclose the information. In response to that, Chevron ran a print campaign to try and combat the anticipated FTC campaign. The double page advertisement read, “If every motorist used Chevron with F-310 for 2000 miles, air pollutants would be reduced by thousands of tons in a single day. The Federal Trade Commission doesn’t think that’s significant.” Hunt used this real-life message as an inoculation treatment in his research. (Lessne and Didow, 1987) ...|$|E
40|$|In US v. Philip Morris USA Inc. (2006), {{six major}} tobacco {{companies}} {{were ordered to}} provide funding for an extremely large <b>corrective</b> <b>advertising</b> and marketing campaign. The Court ruled that consumers may have been misled and deceived about the (1) health effects of smoking, (2) addictiveness of smoking, (3) lack of health benefit from low tar/light cigarettes, (4) companies’ manipulation of nicotine delivery and cigarette design, and (5) health effects of secondhand smoke. Using print advertising copy test procedures, this research focused on the potential effectiveness of test ads submitted to the Court in impacting these target beliefs. In an initial pilot study, reliable multi-item measures {{for each of these}} belief themes were developed and assessed. These multi-item belief measures were then employed in the subsequent main study, in which the effects of two versions of a print advertisement (submitted to the Court in this litigation) were tested using a mixed experimental design. As hypothesized, results show that corrective ads can {{have a positive effect on}} the belief themes (compared to a control group not exposed to such ads), but there is an interaction demonstrating that some belief themes are more strongly affected by the test ads than are others. Results suggested that the beliefs about light/low tar cigarettes may be substantially affected by such a campaign. The addition to the ad copy of graphic visuals, such as those currently used on cigarette packages in Canada and Australia, had mixed results overall. Contributions of the research include the development of reliable multi-item measures for critical smoking-related beliefs, as well as implications of the copy test findings for this specific case and <b>corrective</b> <b>advertising,</b> tobacco counter advertising, and public policy, in general...|$|E
40|$|N {{the absence}} of {{meaningful}} government regulation of the United States food industry, public health advo-cates are turning to litigation {{as a means to}} curb the obesity epidemic. The private right of legal action has {{played a critical role in}} protecting United States con-sumers from harmful products by raising public awareness, increasing self-policing by industry, and ultimately curb-ing practices harmful to consumers. Asbestos litigation curtailed use of the material and compensated thousands of injured consumers. Tobacco litigation, generally ridiculed in its first four decades, helped turn public opinion against the tobacco industry in the mid- 1990 s, forcing manufacturers to stop denying the dangers of smoking, to end the use of cartoon characters, and to discontinue certain other unconscionable marketing practices, as well as contribute hundreds of millions of dol-lars to <b>corrective</b> <b>advertising</b> campaigns.

40|$|In recent years, European {{countries}} have faced an ever increasing levels of activities by consumerists. Much {{of this activity}} is aimed at regulating and controlling advertising. This article examines the views of advertising industry and corporate advertising executives toward this movement in two neighboring European countries: West Germany and Switzerland. Results show that even though these {{countries have}} different levels of advertising regulation, the executives in both countries hold generally similar attitudes toward most advertising issues. Additionally, the Swiss respondents, {{more so than the}} West Germans, feel consumer organizations have more influence on advertising regulation. West German respondents, on the other hand, more strongly favor self-control as a means of advertising regulation. Finally, the Swiss respondents show a more favorable view toward <b>corrective</b> <b>advertising</b> as a method of controlling misleading advertisements. © 1982 JIBS.

40|$|This article {{presents}} two studies that examine {{similarities and differences}} with respect to how adults and adolescents process and respond to information in an antitobacco ad campaign. Study 1 examines (1) the effects of antitobacco advertising campaign measures (e. g., campaign advertisement integration, perceived strength of ad-based messages, attitude toward the ad campaign) on four key adult antismoking beliefs and (2) the influence of these campaign evaluations and beliefs on smokers’ intentions to quit smoking. Hierarchical regression results show that antismoking ad campaign reactions explain substantial additional variance in beliefs about tobacco industry deceptiveness, smoking addictiveness, harmfulness of secondhand smoke, and restrictions on smoking at different public venues. The findings also show that the campaign variables as a whole are positively related to intentions to quit smoking, beyond the variance that is explained by demographics. In Study 2, the authors replicate and extend these findings for the campaign using similar measures and procedures for a sample of more than 900 adolescents. They draw comparisons between these adult and adolescent findings and offer some implications for potential <b>corrective</b> <b>advertising</b> for consumers’ beliefs about smoking that may be required of tobacco companies based on U. S. v. Philip Morris USA, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 144 - 151) This {{study investigated}} {{the possibility of a}} cycle of consumer protection activity operating in the United States during the past century, spaced at approximately thirty-year intervals and followed by legislation to control false advertising. Economic, social, and political conditions were described in the four periods delineated, i. e., post-Civil War, the early 1900 's, the Great Depression years, and the contemporary era dating from 1960. The investigation traced the history of advertising and attempts of the advertising profession at self-regulation, the rise of the consumer movement to its present strength, and significant legislation passed and pending affecting false advertising and consumer protection. Creation of the Federal Trade Commission was described, as well as the ways in which its. authority has been expanded through testing in the courts and recent structural reorganization and policy changes. <b>Corrective</b> <b>advertising,</b> substantiation of advertising claims, and counter-advertising proposals of the Commission from 1970 to mid- 1972 were discussed and the reaction of the advertising profession to them. The conclusion showed that there appeared to be evidence to support an hypothesis of cyclical activity relating to consumer uprisings and legislation, with the possibility of the cycle continuing in the future, Reasons for the unlikelihood of cycles occurring either less, or more, frequently were presented, and similarities and dissimilarities of the four periods were traced. Recommendations for further study concerning advertising, business, government regulation and the consumer movement were given...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE – Sport events {{organizers}} {{have recently}} undertaken to disclose {{to the general}} public instances where firms have conspired to ambush the official sponsors. In doing so, they have sought to sensitise audiences to sponsors' valuable contribution. However, what is the effect of such disclosure on ambush marketers' brands? This study aims to answer this question, using an experimental approach. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH – Two successive experiments were conducted. The first study used a student sample (n= 120) and a fictitious brand. The second study used a before-and-after experiment with control groups (n= 480), using four real brands and print disclosure articles. Data was collected from six French metropolitan areas and analysed using Repeated Measure ANOVA and MANOVA. FINDINGS – Ambush marketing disclosure is associated with lower attitudes towards the ambusher's brand. Two variables moderate this effect: involvement in the event and attitude towards sponsorship, both of which worsen the negative influence of ambush disclosure on audiences' attitudes. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS – While the empirical work reflects one national context and one specific sport event, these findings are the first to empirically support the notion that disclosure of ambush practices adversely impacts ambushers' brand. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS – These results offer official sponsors and event organisers an effective alternative strategy to legal protection, with demonstrated effects on the core target audience of the event. ORIGINALITY/VALUE – The literature has alluded to possible perverse effects of ambush marketing. This study is the first to draw an analogy with <b>corrective</b> <b>advertising</b> to test and demonstrate the impact of ambush disclosure on ambushers' brands.

40|$|A {{competitive}} marketplace for goods, {{services and}} associated credit {{is in no}} small measure dependent upon the existence of adequately informed consumers. Consumers who are ignorant of the full nature, quantity and price of items sold, or credit available, in the market cannot make a rational purchasing decision. Chapter I endeavours to place the topic of consumer information in socio-economic perspective, considers the necessity for government intervention in the marketplace and outlines basic objectives of consumer protection legislation. Chapter II is devoted to business self regulation with emphasis being placed upon the codes of advertising practice. While it is recognised that self regulatory schemes exhibit considerable potential to advance the consumer interest, self regulatory codes of conduct and practice suffer through incomplete subscription to such codes and through inadequate sanctions for enforcement. This dictates that self regulation alone is not enough and that legislative intervention and control is essential. The consumer is accorded a comprehensive and diverse bundle of rights by statute and at common law and Chapter III examines {{the nature and extent of}} the consumer's remedies as against an advertiser, seller, etc. Given the dependence of substantive rights on procedural rights, it is argued that the real measure of benefit conferred lies in the ease of implementation of these rights, or otherwise. Consideration is given to small claims tribunals as important low cost forums for the settlement of disputes and to class and representative actions. Chapter IV discusses statutory control of advertising in New Zealand and liberal reference is made to the regulation of advertising in the United States where considerable development has occured in the fields of <b>corrective</b> <b>advertising</b> and advertisement substantiation. It is suggested that New Zealand could benefit by the promulgation of rules designed to achieve these ends. Furthermore, it is pointed out that control over the genus of unfair advertising is at best partial and it is suggested that the legislature take appropriate steps to remedy deficiencies in this area. The disclosure of information outside the advertising arena is examined in Chapter V and, in particular, attention is focused on the mandatory disclosure regime introduced by the Credit Contracts Act 1981 and on packaging and labelling laws. The valiant efforts of organisations such as the Consumers' Institute who disseminate much useful information relating to goods, services and credit, is discussed. In conclusion it is argued that various measures be implemented to improve the quantity and quality of information available in the New Zealand market and to this end it is proposed that a new Consumer Information Act be enacted. It is also submitted that this legislation, and other consumer protection legislation, be administered under the umbrella of a Consumer Affairs Department...|$|E
