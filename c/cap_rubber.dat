40|$|Multiband mucosectomy (MBM) {{is widely}} used for the {{endoscopic}} resection of early neoplasia in the upper gastrointestinal tract. A new MBM-device may have advantages over the current MBM-device with improved visualization, easier passage of accessories, and higher suction power due to different trip wire and <b>cap.</b> <b>Rubber</b> bands were released one by one for both MBM-devices while endoscopic images were collected. First, free endoscopic view was assessed by computer-assisted measurements (quantitative) and by ranking the images {{by a panel of}} 11 endoscopists (qualitative). Second, using a visual analog scale, three 'blinded' endoscopists assessed introduction and advancement of three types of endoscopic devices through the working channel of a diagnostic endoscope with the MBM-devices assembled. Third, suction power was evaluated by a manometer attached to the cap of the assembled MBM-devices in four endoscopes. Negative pressures were measured after 5 and 10 s of suction and repeated five times. The passage and suction experiments were performed with dry trip wires and repeated after soaking with bloody, mucous fluids. With all bands present, endoscopic views were 90 and 40 % in the new and current MBM-device, respectively. With the release of more bands, differences slowly disappeared. The panel scored a better endoscopic view in the new MBM-device (p = 0. 03). Passage of all accessories was considered significantly easier in the new MBM-device. With the associated snare in the working channel, suction power was significantly better with the new MBM-device. Compared to the currently available MBM-device, the new MBM-device provides improved endoscopic visibility, smoother passage of accessories, and higher suction powe...|$|E

5000|$|Working {{conditions}} were barely tolerable at Barnbow. The workers {{who handled the}} explosives had to strip to their underwear, and wear smocks and <b>caps.</b> <b>Rubber</b> soled shoes were also provided, and cigarettes and matches were completely banned. The hours on site were long, and the staff did not receive holidays at all. The food rationing was also rather severe, but the workers were allowed to drink as much barley water and milk as they liked, {{due to the nature}} of their jobs. Barnbow had its own farm, housing 120 cows which produced 300 gallons of milk per day. The workers often worked with Cordite which was a propellant for the shells, but had the unfortunate side effect on people who came into contact with it of turning their skin yellow. A cure for this ailment was to drink plenty of milk. Due to the [...] "yellow" [...] appearance of many of the women's skin, it earned them the nickname The Barnbow Canaries, which later inspired a play called Barnbow Canaries which premieres at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in the summer of 2016.|$|R

Glass stoppers typically have a matching tapered inner (or male) ground glass joint surface, but often only of stopper quality. Flasks which do not come with such stoppers or caps included may be <b>capped</b> with a <b>rubber</b> bung or cork stopper.|$|R
40|$|CIVINSThis thesis {{develops}} a 3 -degree of freedom submarine drydock blocking system {{computer aided design}} package. Differential equations of motion are developed {{to take into account}} high blocking systems, wale shores, and side block cap angles. The computer program is verified by a case study involving the earthquake sliding failure of the USS Leahy (CG- 16). A parametric study is conducted {{to determine the effects of}} wale shores, isolators, and block stiffness and geometry variations on system survivability. The effects of using earthquake acceleration time histories with differing frequency spectrums on system survivability is studied. None of eleven submarine drydock blocking systems studied survive to dry dock failure (0. 26 g's) or even meet the Navy's current 0. 2 g survival requirement. This shows that current Navy submarine drydock blocking systems are inadequate to survive expected earthquakes. Two design solutions are found that meet the dry dock failure requirements. The low stiffness solution uses dynamic isolators and <b>rubber</b> <b>caps,</b> and the high stiffness solution uses wale shores and <b>rubber</b> <b>caps.</b> The wale shore solution virtually prevents the submarine from moving horizontally relative to the dock floor. The isolator solution allows relatively large horizontal displacements to occur. Using the wale shore solution, the submarine experiences forces which are an order of magnitude higher than these seen by the isolator solution. Both design solutions can be constructed; however, there are cost and production interference concerns. Theses. (edc) [URL]...|$|R

50|$|Endpins {{are usually}} tipped with {{a point to}} stick into the floor, which is {{sometimes}} <b>capped</b> with black <b>rubber</b> to preserve the floor's surface and provide friction. Generally, endpins are parallel to the long axis of the instrument, but some cellists and bassists fit their instruments with a Tortelier-style endpin, which angles more towards the floor, improving mobility {{at the expense of}} stability. Also, some endpins have a secondary extension for tall musicians. The endpin also may have notches cut in it, allowing it to have extra holding strength at these points. This design is particularly common on string basses and beginning-level cellos. The former often require these because of their greater weight.|$|R

Light rapiers consist of commercially manufactured foil and Ã©pÃ©e, though the hilt and guard are sometimes replaced or altered to make them more closely resemble a historical sword. Heavy rapier are full-sized replicas of historical swords, with certain differences for safety reasons: The edges and tip must be blunt, with tips covered with a <b>cap</b> made of <b>rubber,</b> leather or plastic. Heavy rapier blades must pass a minimum flexibility test to be used.|$|R
50|$|A third {{strategy}} is to equip the door itself with a stopping mechanism. In this case, a short metal bar <b>capped</b> with <b>rubber,</b> or another high friction material, {{is attached to a}} hinge {{near the bottom of the}} door opposite the door hinge and on the side of the door which is in the direction that it closes. When the door is to be kept open, the bar is swung down so that the rubber end touches the floor. In this configuration, further movement of the door towards being closed increases the force on the rubber end, thereby increasing the frictional force which opposes the movement. When the door is to be closed, the stop is released by pushing the door slightly more open which releases the stop and allows it to be flipped upwards. A newer version of equipping the door with the stopping mechanism is to attach a magnet to the bottom of the door on the side which opens outward which then latches onto another magnet or magnetic material on the wall or a small hub on the floor. The magnet must be strong enough to hold the weight of the door, but weak enough to be easily detached from the wall or hub.|$|R
