40|$|A new {{algorithm}} is developed to solve models with heterogeneous agents and aggregate uncertainty. Projection methods {{are the main}} building blocks of the algorithm and - {{in contrast to the}} most popular solution procedure - simulations only play a very minor role. The paper also develops a new simulation procedure that not only avoids <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>sampling</b> variation but is 10 (66) times faster than simulating an economy with 10, 000 (100, 000) agents. Because it avoids <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>sampling</b> variation, it can generate an accurate representation of the whole cross-sectional distribution. Finally, the paper outlines a set of accuracy tests. ...|$|R

To prepare the samples for TEM observation, the NRs were dispersed via the ethanol solution. A small droplet of the solution was then dropped onto the copper TEM grid. To prepare the samples for cross-section TEM observation, the saw-like edged NRs were dispersed via ethanol solution onto Ge substrates coated with 30 nm of Au film.

50|$|The German Ageing Survey (DEAS) {{is funded}} by the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (BMFSFJ). The first survey wave was {{conducted}} in 1996. It was designed and {{carried out by the}} research group on ageing and the life course from the Freie Universität Berlin, the research group on psychogerontology of the University of Nijmegen and infas Institute for Applied Social Sciences, Bonn. From 2000 onwards, the German Centre of Gerontology (DZA) was responsible for the implementation and further development of the project. The second survey wave of DEAS followed in 2002, the third was conducted in 2008, the fourth was conducted in 2011 and the fifth was conducted in 2014. The data assessments are furthermore carried out by infas Institute for Applied Social Sciences. Starting from 2008, the DEAS panel is conducted every three years. The most recent survey in 2011 therefore considered panel participants only. A new <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>sample</b> is drawn every six years. This approach enables the investigation of social change as well as individual development over a 18-year span. A book containing the key findings of the fifth wave will be published in 2016.

50|$|In 1983, {{researchers}} Mary Jo Bane and David T. Ellwood {{used the}} Panel Study of Income Dynamics {{to examine the}} duration of spells of poverty (defined as continuous periods spent with income under the poverty line), looking specifically at entry and exit. They found that while three in five people who were just beginning a spell of poverty {{came out of it}} within three years, only one-quarter of people who had already been poor for three years were able to exit poverty within the next two. The probability that a person will be able to exit poverty declines as the spell lengthens. A small but significant group of recipients remained on welfare for much longer, forming the bulk of poverty at any one point in time and requiring the most in government resources. At any one time, if a <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>sample</b> of poor people in the United States was taken, about 60% would be in a spell of poverty that would last at least eight years. Interest thus arose in studying the determinants of long-term receipt of welfare. Bane & Ellwood found that only 37% of poor people in their sample became poor {{as a result of the}} head of household’s wages decreasing, and their average spell of poverty lasted less than four years. On the other hand, entry into poverty that was the result of a woman becoming head of household lasted on average for more than five years. Children born into poverty were particularly likely to remain poor.|$|E

In order to clarify whether a core/shell structure is developed for the particle, various methodologies were tried to prepare a cross-sectional TEM sample. Focused ion beam (FIB) milling was conducted for cold-compacted particles, dispersed particles on silicon wafer, and impregnated particles with epoxy which is compatible with electron beam.

40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} {{of quality of}} life is critical to cost-effectiveness analysis. Never-theless, development of sampling algorithms to maximize the accuracy and efficiency of estimated quality of life has received little consideration to date. This paper presents a method to optimize sampling strategies for estimating quality-adjusted life years. In particular, the authors address the questions of when to sample and how many ob-servations to sample at each sampling time, assuming realistically that the sample variance of {{quality of life is}} not constant over time. The method is particularly useful for the design problems researchers face when time or research budget constraints limit the number of individuals that can be surveyed to estimate quality of life. The article focuses on <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>sampling.</b> The method proposed requires some knowledge of survival in the population of interest, the approximate variances in utilities at various points along the curve, and the general shape of the quality-adjusted survival curve. Such data are frequently available from disease registries, the literature, or previous studies.
