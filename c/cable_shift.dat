5000|$|... 5-speed manual {{transmission}} changed from rod shift to <b>cable</b> <b>shift.</b>|$|E
50|$|Before the 1990s many {{manufacturers}} made derailleurs, including Simplex, Huret, Galli, Mavic, Gipiemme, Zeus, Suntour, and Shimano. However, {{the successful}} introduction {{and promotion of}} indexed shifting by Shimano in 1985 required a compatible system of shift levers, derailleur, sprockets, chainrings, chain, <b>shift</b> <b>cable,</b> and <b>shift</b> housing.|$|R
5000|$|In 1989, the Rallye Golf {{appeared}} as a rallye [...] "homologation special". Distinguishable by its box-flared wheel arches (similar to the Audi quattro, BMW E30 M3 and Lancia Delta Integrale) and rectangular projector headlamps, this model featured Syncro four-wheel drive, a <b>cable</b> <b>shifted</b> transmission and a G-supercharger 1763 cc (less than the typical 1.8L 1781 cc to meet the engine displacement rules) version of the injected 8 valve G60 1.8 litre engine.|$|R
5000|$|For cables {{we provide}} wall/deck {{penetration}} sleeve {{to avoid any}} damage to <b>cable</b> from material <b>shifting</b> on deck.|$|R
25|$|Large devices called saddles, {{which will}} carry the main {{suspension}} cables, are positioned atop the towers. Typically of cast steel, {{they can also be}} manufactured using riveted forms, and are equipped with rollers to allow the main <b>cables</b> to <b>shift</b> under construction and normal loads.|$|R
5000|$|The Shimano {{compatible}} {{family of}} derailleurs is stated {{as having a}} shift ratio of two-to-one (2:1), and since SRAM makes two families of components, the term has been widely adopted to distinguish it from SRAM's own one-to-one (1:1) ratio family of derailleurs. Notice that these family names do not give the exact shift ratios: the 2:1 shift ratio is in fact about 1.7 (Or 1.9 on the Dura Ace series up to 7400) rather than 2, and the native SRAM shift ratio is about 1.1. The family names of these standards are reversed by some in actuation ratio notation as opposed {{to that of the}} more common shift ratio. Thus, in Shimano systems a unit of <b>cable</b> <b>shifted</b> causes about twice as much movement of the derailleur.|$|R
50|$|The company's {{offices and}} {{sleeping}} quarters burned down in 1914. The cable station remained in operation until 1917, when the <b>cable</b> was <b>shifted</b> to Titahi Bay near Wellington {{due to the}} increasing economic importance of the North Island. The place name changed to Cable Bay in 1926.|$|R
50|$|Born {{and raised}} in raised in the small of Mammoth, Arizona, Salazar worked for a while after {{finishing}} high school as a <b>cable</b> technician before <b>shifting</b> his focus to mixed martial arts.|$|R
50|$|In 2014 GM has {{recalled}} the vehicle regarding {{a condition in}} which the transmission <b>shift</b> <b>cable</b> may fracture. The fracture prevents the driver from selecting gears and may cause the vehicle to move in an unintended direction.|$|R
50|$|Different {{versions}} of the transaxle are available depending upon the application. Both <b>cable</b> and rod <b>shift</b> mechanisms are available, as well as application-specific clutch housings. The MU3 and MC2 are differentiated by ratios, with the MC2 available with a lower top-gear ratio.|$|R
40|$|The SPEAR 3 {{synchrotron}} lightsource at SLAC {{relies on}} a sophisticated radio frequency (RF) timing system to maintain current – electrons – in the storage ring. One problem SPEAR 3 operators have dealt with is the thermal expansion {{of one of the}} cables supporting this RF timing system. As the cable expands and contracts with the diurnal {{rise and fall of the}} sun, the phase of the RF in the <b>cable</b> <b>shifts.</b> This shifting phase affects the timing accuracy of electron injections into the storage ring. A common feedback control algorithm PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) has countless applications in engineering. PID feedback can solve this problem of diurnal phase shift nicely. In general, feedback control of a dynamic variable requires the completion of a feedback loop; the variable is fed as input to the controller, which in turn modifies the variable. These principles were used to write a software program that controls a phase modulation box to compensate for the thermal expansion of the RF timing cable. The software was written and compiled with MATLAB, and interfaces with the EPICS control system at SLAC to control the hardware. The system also provides diagnostic tools and software control of the phase in this part of the timing system...|$|R
5000|$|Adweek (or Ad Week) is {{a weekly}} American {{advertising}} trade publication that {{was first published}} in 1978.Adweek covers creativity, client-agency relationships, global advertising, accounts in review, and new campaigns. During this time, it has covered several notable <b>shifts,</b> including <b>cable</b> television, the <b>shift</b> away from commission-based agency fees, and the Internet.|$|R
50|$|In 2016, Fox Sports {{executive}} Jamie Horowitz {{took over}} {{the operations of the}} division's digital properties. Horowitz (who had led the Fox Sports 1 <b>cable</b> channel's <b>shift</b> to opinion-based studio programming rather than general sports news coverage) began to institute new editorial practices at FoxSports.com, proposing that the website's written content be used to promote Fox Sports pundits and their television programs, including Fox Sports 1 hosts Colin Cowherd and Skip Bayless, rather than original reports. During the lead-up to Super Bowl LI, the website piloted an aspect of this content strategy by having articles ghostwritten under the names of FS1 pundits.|$|R
50|$|Silver plus is a two-seater, step-through {{motorcycle}} {{that was}} introduced by Royal Enfield Motors in India in the 1980s. It {{was one of the}} first geared step-through motorcycles in India. It was launched along with Explorer, another mini bike, a two-seater that featured the same engine. While Silver Plus featured a hand operated <b>cable</b> link gear <b>shifts,</b> Explorer used a foot-operated gear shift.|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, extra {{high voltage}} (EHV) {{transmission}} systems consist exclusively of overhead lines (OHL) {{but in the}} recent years the utilization of high voltage AC (HVAC) power cables is increasing due to environmental, political and operational aspects. To study the impact of HVAC power cables on temporary overvoltages and slow front transients, a simulation model of the large-scale network is required. Guidelines concerning the modeling detail for the surrounding network need to be established to ensure sufficient accurate results. Existing guidelines for purely OHL transmission networks may not be adequate since the integration of HVAC power <b>cables</b> <b>shift</b> the harmonic impedance of the network to lower frequencies and that can affect the extent of the needed simulation model. Much effort can be saved from obtaining detailed data for an extensive but proper model, but a less detailed model might not describe the network behavior with sufficient accuracy. In this study, simplification options are considered, for which the time to construct and analyze a simulation model can be reduced. The simplification options are compared with the reference model (full detail), and judged based on three indicators for the level of accuracy: frequency and amplitude of the main resonance, and maximum over-voltage. As a result, guidelines on the extent of the simulated network and in which detail the model has to be built are proposed. The inverse approach, i. e. increasing level of detail until simulation results hardly change leads to similar results, but requires equivalent short-circuit networks {{for the rest of the}} grid. The method is tested for the Dutch 380 kV grid where an underground cable connection of 10. 8 km length is introduced in 2013 and a second connection is planned for 2017...|$|R
5000|$|The design, {{developed}} by Shimano, improves on their earlier Uniglide design (which used beveled gear teeth instead of ramps), and was introduced {{as part of}} a commercially viable index shifting system. The Hyperglide ramps, along with laterally floating derailleur jockey wheels, allows for enough [...] "slop" [...] in the system to make indexed shifting reliable, despite variations in <b>shift</b> <b>cable</b> adjustment and manufacturing or assembly tolerances. A Hyperglide freewheel or cassette on a bike with friction shifters can further improve shifting.|$|R
50|$|Most hub gears are {{operated}} {{in a similar}} manner, with a single twist, trigger or thumb-shifter. An exception is the older style of Sturmey-Archer 5-speed, which used a second <b>shift</b> <b>cable</b> to change between close and wide-range sun gears, effectively giving two 3-speed hubs in one unit. The middle gear in both ranges was direct drive, so there were five distinct gears. They could either be controlled with a special 5-speed shifter which operated both cables, or with a regular 3-speed shifter and a friction shifter.|$|R
50|$|These classic racing handlebars, as used on road or track bicycles. The {{bars are}} {{designed}} with three basic parameters; reach, drop and width. They can be further classified into three categories. Classic typically having a long reach and a deep drop, Compact featuring shorter reach and a shallow drop and ergo/anatomic described below. Drop bars may {{have one or two}} longitudinal indentations so that the brake and <b>shift</b> <b>cables</b> protrude less when they are wrapped under the bar tape. They may also have a flattened top section.|$|R
5000|$|Researcher David Wrone {{dismissed}} {{the theory that}} Kennedy's body was surreptitiously removed from the presidential plane, stating that as is done with all cargo on airplanes for safety precautions, the coffin and lid were held by steel wrapping <b>cables</b> to prevent <b>shifting</b> during takeoff and landing and in case of air disturbances in flight. According to Wrone, {{the side of the}} plane away from the television camera [...] "was bathed in klieg lights, and thousands of persons watched along the fence that bent backward along that side, providing, in effect, a well-lit and very public stage for any would-be body snatchers".|$|R
5000|$|The linear {{movement}} of the inner cable is most often used to transmit a pulling force, although push/pull cables have gained popularity in recent years e.g. as gear <b>shift</b> <b>cables.</b> Many light aircraft use a push/pull bowden cable for the throttle control, {{and here it is}} normal for the inner element to be solid wire, rather than a multi-strand cable. Usually provision is made for adjusting the cable tension using an inline hollow bolt (often called a [...] "barrel adjuster"), which lengthens or shortens the cable housing relative to a fixed anchor point. Lengthening the housing (turning the barrel adjuster out) tightens the cable; shortening the housing (turning the barrel adjuster in) loosens the cable.|$|R
5000|$|The Flightsail is {{a single}} seat open cockpit parasol-winged glider with {{tricycle}} landing gear. The fuselage is constructed of a triangular pyramid-shaped or tetrahedral truss; the pilot was positioned {{in front of the}} triangle-control frame. The framed flexible wing resembles a hang-glider arrangement as used on the kited gliders of Paresev program and by Ryan Aeronautical Company. The glider used weight-shift pendulum control using a stick with <b>cables</b> that <b>shifts</b> the cg of the frame relative to the wing pivoting above it. The wing is constructed with a 50-degree sweep based on NASA technical note D-443 and covered with polyethylene sheet with rip-stop fiberglass tape in a one-foot mesh pattern. The aircraft was tested by NASA test pilots Milton Orville Thompson and Victor Horton [...] to compare against the Rogallo wing being tested for space vehicle recovery. Purcell published that in an early 1962 flight session, Francis M. Rogallo also had a flight in the Flightsail; years later Purcell would have a very different aircraft using the flexible-wing in a modification which was flown by Francis M. Rogallo. Purcell's later Flight Dynamics Flightsail VII used the flexible-wing in a modified format.|$|R
5000|$|Reaction to {{the show}} among critics has been mostly positive, though the week it premiered, Alex Pareene, {{columnist}} for the left-leaning website Salon.com, slammed it as [...] "boring and lame" [...] and [...] "not even worth getting outraged about." [...] Entertainment Weekly TV critic Ken Tucker dubbed the show his [...] "favorite guilty pleasure" [...] and praised its freewheeling style and zany humor, calling it [...] "a delightfully nutty show with an undercurrent of ragin’ crazy." [...] Mediaite's Frances Martel, examining <b>cable</b> news' <b>shift</b> toward more personality-driven commentary, praised The Five for adding an element of entertainment to the news: [...] "Beyond having opinions, {{the new generation of}} cable news talk shows spearheaded by The Five have personalities, characters and character arcs that are worth tuning in for. ... Unlike the previous, host-driven generation of opinion shows, The Five adds a refreshing new element to cable news- a plot." [...] The Daily Show with Jon Stewart would later take that line of thought to strange new places when [...] "correspondent" [...] Samantha Bee debuted her [...] "one-woman show" [...] about the supposed romantic subplot on The Five.|$|R
40|$|Addressing today's {{environmental}} challenges {{is intimately}} linked to understanding and improving natural resource governance institutions. As a result conservation initiatives are increasingly realizing {{the importance of}} integrating local perspectives of land tenure arrangements, natural resource rights, and local beliefs into conservation approaches. However, current work has not sufficiently considered the dynamic nature of natural resource governance institutions over time and the potential implications for current conservation interventions. We therefore explored how and why hunting governance has changed since the precolonial period in two ethnic hunting communities in Gabon, Central Africa, integrating various ethnographic methods with resource-use mapping, and a historic literature review. In both communities, hunting governance has undergone significant changes since the precolonial period. A closed-access, lineage-based system of resource use with strict penalties for trespassing, {{has evolved into a}} more open-access system, in which the influence of customary governance systems, including magico-political aspects, has declined. These changes have occurred mainly in response to policies and governance structures put in place by the colonial government and postindependence, early state laws. This included a policy of merging villages, the introduction of more modern hunting techniques such as guns and wire <b>cables,</b> and a <b>shift</b> from community to government ownership of the land. Current governance structures are thus the product of a complex mixture of customary, colonial and state influences. These findings suggest that a historical perspective of resource governance, gained through in-depth and long-term engagement with local communities, can provide important insights for community-based conservation approaches, such as helping to identify potential causes and perceptions of environmental change and to design more suitable conservation initiatives with local people...|$|R
