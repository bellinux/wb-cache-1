5000|$|Talmessite {{is a rare}} {{secondary}} mineral formed typically in the oxidized zone of some hydrothermal mineral deposits, as an alteration product of realgar, orpiment, or Cu-Ni arsenides. [...] Cobalt-rich varieties {{are found in the}} oxidised zone of <b>cobalt</b> <b>arsenide</b> deposits.

50|$|Skutterudites, a <b>cobalt</b> <b>arsenide</b> mineral with {{variable}} {{amounts of}} nickel and iron, {{can be produced}} artificially, and are candidates for better thermoelectric materials. One advantage of nanostructured skutterudites over normal skutterudites is their reduced thermal conductivity, caused by grain boundary scattering. ZT values of ~0.65 and > 0.4 have been achieved with CoSb3 based samples; the former values were 2.0 for Ni and 0.75 for Te-doped material at 680 K and latter for Au-composite at T > 700 K.|$|E
50|$|Loellingite, also spelled löllingite, is an iron {{arsenide}} mineral with formula FeAs2. It {{is often}} found associated with arsenopyrite (FeAsS) {{from which it}} is hard to distinguish. Cobalt, nickel and sulfur substitute in the structure. The orthorhombic lollingite group includes the nickel iron arsenide rammelsbergite and the <b>cobalt</b> iron <b>arsenide</b> safflorite.

40|$|A {{program of}} geochemical {{prospecting}} {{was carried out}} in the summer of 1952 near Cobalt, Ontario. The area in which this work was done lies in the Precambrian shield of Canada, about 320 nailes north of Toronto. Much of the area is covered by glacial deposits. The known ore bodies are predominantly thin veins of silver, and nickel and <b>cobalt</b> <b>arsenides</b> found as mesothermal fissure fillings in vertical faults and joints of the area. The cobalt concentration in samples of glacial material, collected on a horizontal and vertical grid over an area of proven miner-alization at depth, was determined in order to test the applicability of geochemical prospecting techniques in locating ore bodies in similar situations. A cobalt anomaly in the overburden was located; subsequent drilling proved up mineralization in non-commercial quantities in the bedrock. It is concluded that the present technique is applicable in locat-ing ore bodies where mineralization extends to the bedrock surface in geologic settings imilar to those in the Cobalt, Ontario district...|$|R
5000|$|Safflorite {{is a rare}} <b>cobalt</b> iron <b>arsenide</b> mineral with formula: (Co,Fe)As2. Pure safflorite {{would be}} just CoAs2, but iron is {{virtually}} always present. Safflorite {{is a member of}} the three-way substitution series of arsenides known as the loellingite or loellingite group. More than fifty percent iron makes the mineral loellingite whereas more than fifty percent nickel and the mineral is rammelsbergite. A parallel series of antimonide minerals exist.|$|R
50|$|Named {{after the}} city of Skotterud, Norway, Skutterudite is a <b>cobalt</b> <b>arsenide</b> mineral that has {{variable}} amounts of nickel and iron substituting for cobalt with a general formula: CoAs3. Some references give the arsenic a variable formula subscript of 2-3. High nickel varieties {{are referred to as}} nickel-skutterudite, previously chloanthite. It is a hydrothermal ore mineral found in moderate to high temperature veins with other Ni-Co minerals. Associated minerals are arsenopyrite, native silver, erythrite, annabergite, nickeline, cobaltite, silver sulfosalts, native bismuth, calcite, siderite, barite and quartz. It is mined as an ore of cobalt and nickel with a by-product of arsenic.|$|E
40|$|The leach {{solution}} obtained by leaching of zinc containing ores typically {{has to be}} highly purified {{before it can be}} used as electrolyte for the electrowinning of zinc. Cobalt is a troublesome impurity in the sense that not only has it even at relatively low concentrations a very significant negative impact on the zinc electrowinning process, but that is also difficult to remove by the zinc cementation process typically used for this purpose. The aim with the present work was to better understand the arsenic activated cementation of cobalt using zinc powder to enable the optimization of an industrial purification plant. Thermodynamic based calculations confirmed that the role of arsenic in the process is to allow for the precipitation of the cobalt at more positive potentials as <b>cobalt</b> <b>arsenide</b> and that {{it should be possible to}} remove the cobalt to very low concentrations with zinc cementation. The kinetics of cobalt cementation was studied using batch cementation experiments using different sizes and quantities of zinc dust and by varying the temperature. The nature of the cementation products was characterized using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. It was found that the cobalt cementation could be described by a first order rate equation but with a faster initial stage with an activation energy of 43 kJ/mol followed by a much slower temperature insensitive second stage. Activating species such as copper, cadmium and arsenic cemented faster than the cobalt on the zinc. The rate of cobalt cementation was increased by using the same mass of finer zinc, increasing the temperature and recirculation of some of the cemented cobalt. It was shown that the zinc dust consumption and/or the minimum temperature required to achieve the required cobalt removal could be reduced by recirculation of the cobalt cement from the early stages of a train of backmix reactors or by using zinc dust with a finer size distribution.

40|$|International audienceSkutterudites are a {{class of}} {{compounds}} promising in thermoelectric field. They {{are among the most}} studied thermoelectric materials of the last decade because related to the concept of electron-phonon-glass crystal. In literature there are many studies on Co-based skutterudites filled with Rare Earths (RE) (Ballikaya et al. 2012, Daniel et al. 2015, Zhang et al. 2015, Lili et al. 2015, Bhaskar et al. 2015) and Fe,Co-based (REFe 4 -xCoxSb 12) (Jacobsen et al. 2014, Zhang et al. 2015, Rogl et al. 2010 a), while very few are the studies on Fe,Ni–based skutterudites (REFe 4 -xNixSb 12) (Tan et al. 2013 a, Kaltzoglou et al. 2012, Morimura et al. 2003). The name “Skutterudite” comes from a small mining town, Skutterud, in Norway where it was extracted and classified {{for the first time in}} 1845. The natural Skutterudite is a <b>cobalt</b> <b>arsenide</b> mineral that contains variable amounts of Ni and Fe, substituting for cobalt, having the general formula: (Co,Ni,Fe) As 3. Its orogeny is hydrothermal, in moderate-high temperature; it is often found associated with other minerals such as Arsenopyrite, native Silver, Erythrite, Annabergite, Nickeline, Cobaltite, Silver sulfosalts, native Bismuth, Calcite, Siderite, Barite and Quartz. Its density is about 6. 5 g/cm 3 and the Mohs hardness is 6 but these values strictly depend on the composition. Synthetic skutterudites are now produced in laboratory. They include compounds having the composition MX 3, where M is a transition metal of the VIII, IX, X group and X represents a pnitogen atom belonging to the XV group. Oftedal in 1928 identified CoAs 3 as the first synthetic skutterudites and determined its structure as a cubic body-centered cell and space group. CoAs 3 is now reported as the prototype compound for skutterudites. The modelling of skutterudite properties has been the subject of a large number of publications over the past decades. In this review we will only consider a limited set of results pertaining to Fe- or Ni-based skutterudites. This choice aims at preserving coherence with the experimental section of this chapter that mainly deals with these types of compounds...|$|E
40|$|The {{origin of}} {{transition}} metal vacancies {{and their effects}} on the properties of ThCr 2 Si 2 -type compounds have been less studied and poorly understood. Here we carefully investigate the structure, physical properties, and electronic structure {{for a series of}} lanthanum <b>cobalt</b> <b>arsenides</b> with nominal composition of LaCoxAs 2 (1. 6 < = x < = 2. 1). It is revealed that the occupancy of Co can be tuned between 1. 98 (1) and 1. 61 (1). The structural analyses based on X-ray and neutron diffractions show the existence of Co vacancies results from charge balance due to the formation of bond between As-As. These Co vacancies affect the magnetic and electrical properties greatly, adjusting the Curie temperature from 205 to 47 K and increasing the resistivity by more than 100 %. First principles calculations indicate that the Co vacancies weaken the spin polarization and reduce the density of states at the Fermi level, resulting in decreased Curie temperature and increased resistivity, respectively. Our results address the importance of transition metal vacancies in ThCr 2 Si 2 -type materials and offer a reliable route to tune the magnetism of ThCr 2 Si 2 -type structure.

40|$|Recently, the 1144 iron {{arsenide}} (e. g. CaKFe 4 As 4) {{has been}} discovered and inspired a new tide of search for superconductor (SC). Such far, it has discovered various 1144 iron arsenides (XY Fe 4 As 4) containing alkali metals and alkaline earth. In this work, we propose two directions in searching new 1144 structures: (i) building in tri-valence cations; (ii) Substitute the transition metal, e. g. Fe replaced by Co. Following these ideas, we employ density functional theory (DFT) to study stability and electronic structures of 1144 pnictides over a range of tri-valence cations (La, Y, In, Tl, Sm and Gd). For LaXFe 4 As 4, 1144 phase can be stabilized in three systems: LaKFe 4 As 4, LaRbFe 4 As 4 and LaCsFe 4 As 4, which show two-dimensional semi-metal features similar as the iron-based SC: hole-type Fermi surface (FS) at Γ point and electron-type FS at M point in B. Z. In addition, LaKFe 4 As 4 feature an extra bubble shaped FS sheets, distinct from other two peers. Y does not favor any 1144 phase within our search. For In and Tl, by substituting Fe by Co, two unknown 122 phases are stabilized: InCo 2 As 2 and TlCo 2 As 2. The two <b>cobalt</b> <b>arsenides</b> have FS of similar topology as iron arsenide, but FS are all electron-type, showing a {{potential to be a}} new SC. Stable 1144 phase is also found in InKCo 4 As 4 and InRbCo 4 As 4. For Sm and Gd, most 1144 or 122 iron arsenides are unstable. Comment: 11 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|Four rare-earth <b>cobalt</b> <b>arsenides,</b> RCo_ 2 As_ 2 (R = La, Ce, Pr, Nd), were {{obtained}} by reactions of constituent elements in molten Bi. The use of Bi flux also allowed the growth of representative single crystals. All compounds are isostructural and belong to the ThCr_ 2 Si_ 2 type (space group I 4 /mmm). The formation of Co vacancies is observed in all structures, while the structures of La- and Ce-containing compounds also show incorporation of minor Bi defects next to the R crystallographic site. Correspondingly, the general formula of these materials can be written as R_ 1 –xBi_xCo_ 2 −δAs_ 2, with x/δ = 0. 03 / 0. 1, 0. 05 / 0. 15, 0 / 0. 2, and 0 / 0. 3 for R = La, Ce, Pr, and Nd, respectively. All compounds exhibit high-temperature ferromagnetic ordering of Co magnetic moments in the range 60 – 200 K. Electronic band structure calculations revealed a high peak in the density of states at the Fermi level, thus supporting the itinerant nature of magnetism in the Co sublattice. The magnetic ordering in the lanthanide sublattice takes place at lower temperatures, with the R moments aligning antiparallel to the Co moments to give a ferrimagnetic ground state. The measurements on oriented single crystals demonstrated significant magnetic anisotropy in the ferrimagnetic state, with the preferred moment alignment along the c axis of the tetragonal lattice. Neutron powder diffraction failed to reveal the structure of magnetically ordered states but confirmed the presence of Co vacancies. X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy on Ce_ 1. 95 Bi_ 0. 05 Co_ 1. 85 As_ 2 showed the average oxidation state of Ce to be + 3. 06. Solid state NMR spectroscopy revealed a substantially reduced hyperfine field on the Co atoms {{in the vicinity of}} Bi defects...|$|R
