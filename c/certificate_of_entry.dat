40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the relative performance of students admitted into the Medical Programme through Pre-degree Science with those of students admitted through the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB). The performance indices used were the University 100 level Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) and Physiology examination score during the 200 level Comprehensive Examination. The files of students admitted into the Medical Programme in 1998 / 1999, 1999 / 2000 and 2000 / 2001 Sessions were obtained from the Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences. The following data were extracted from each file-age, sex, school <b>certificate</b> result, mode <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> (JAMB, Pre-degree, Direct at 100 level or transfer at 200 level), 100 level CGPA and Physiology score in the 200 level Comprehensive examinations. The study showed that the students admitted through JAMB performed better in 200 level Physiology examinations but there was no correlation between the University Matriculation Examination (UME) Scores and the O-Level aggregate, 100 level CGPA and 200 level Physiology results. The Pre-degree examination score however showed a strong positive correlation with the O-Level aggregate, 100 level CGPA and the 200 level Physiology examination scores. It is therefore recommended that the Pre-degree examination results be used in admitting students into Medicine, as it is a more reliable predictor of success in Medical School Examinations...|$|R
