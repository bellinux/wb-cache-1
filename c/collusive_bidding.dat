To accomplish this, a new method is developed for estimating the values of bid distribution supports by using the solution to what has become known as the German tank problem. The model is then demonstrated and tested on a sample of real construction bid data and shown to detect cover bids with high accuracy.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2009. Major: Economics. Advisor: Patrick Bajari. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 95 pages, appendices A-B. The dissertation {{consists of two}} essays on FCC spectrum auctions. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has used auctions to allocate radio spectrum frequencies to wireless service providers since 1994. The innovation of the auction design is that it offers many heterogeneous licenses simultaneously in one ascending auction. The first essay studies changes in bidders' bidding behavior in response {{to changes in the}} auction rules that occurred over the past 15 years. It particularly focuses on the introduction of new auction rules intended to mitigate collusive behavior such as click box bidding and anonymous bidding. We examine the frequencies of seemingly <b>collusive</b> <b>bids</b> such as retaliatory bids and non-collusive bids such as straightforward bids using data from 4 auctions: the PCS C Block, the PCS C&F Block Reauction, the Advanced Wireless Service auction and the 700 MHz auction. While this simple descriptive exercise has a number of limitations, the data suggest that these rule changes have limited the ability of firms to tacitly collude. The second essay develops an empirical model and procedure to estimate bidder valuations. Given that the complex nature of the auction does not admit formal modeling in a general setting, I do not explore a particular model of equilibrium bidding. Instead, I propose two revealed preference inequalities which should hold in any reasonable model of these auctions. I employ an estimation strategy that generates a map from the observed bidding behavior to a set of distributions of bidder valuations consistent with these behavioral assumptions. I apply the empirical model to an auction held in 2006. Using the estimated distribution of bidder valuations, I estimate bidder markups in order to gauge the level of competition in this auction. The estimated bidder markups are large: the median for local bidders such as rural telephone companies is 26...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{spectrum}} auction is {{an effective}} solution to provide spectrum on-demand to many small wireless networks. As {{the number of participants}} grows, bidder collusion becomes a serious threat. In this paper, we study bidder collusion in large-scale spectrum auctions, investigating its impact on auction outcomes. We found that the nature of the complex interference constraints among bidders provides a fertile breeding ground for colluders, causing significant damage in auction efficiency and revenue. In particular, collusion group of small size plays a dominant role since it is easy to form and hard to be detected. We propose Athena, a new collusion-resistant auction framework for large-scale dynamic spectrum auction. Athena implements a soft collusion resistance, allowing the auctioneer to exploit the tradeoff between the level of collusion resistance and the cost of achieving such level of resistance. Unlike existing solutions, Athena enables spectrum reuse across bidders, achieves soft collusion resistance against any form of <b>collusive</b> <b>bidding</b> strategy, maintains provable revenue guarantee, and does so with polynomial-time complexity. To provide a comprehensive evaluation, we first analytically prove Athena’s collusion resistance and revenue guarantee (under any bids), and then experimentally verify our analytical conclusions using empirical bid distributions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: I {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} four static sealed-bid package auctions in an exper-imental setting with complementarities. The underlying valuation model comprises two items, and three bidders; two individualbidders demand one item only, while the third bidder wants to win both. The rules being compared include the Vickrey and 8 ̆ 5 rst-price auctions, {{as well as the}} Vickrey Nearest Rule and the Reference Rule. Auction-level tests 8 ̆ 5 nd the 8 ̆ 5 rst-price auction revenue dominant over the other three rules, while the Vickrey auction performs worst, with the other two rules ranking intermediate. Bidder-level tests of the experimental data reject the competitive equilibrium bidding functions that can be derived in this setting, and I 8 ̆ 5 nd that overbidding is widespread in all four auctions, as is aversion to submitting boundary bids. I also observe behaviour consistent with <b>collusive</b> <b>bidding</b> by participants in the Vickrey auction. Contrary to theoretical predictions, the Vickrey auction performs worst on e ¢ ciency, primarily for this reason. In its currents state, the theory of auctions for single items and substitutes is well-developed, providing equilibrium bidding predictions and revenue rankings under a broad variety of assumptions.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the signaling {{that occurred in}} many of the FCC spectrum auctions. The auction design, a simultaneous ascending auction, allowed bidders to bid on numerous communication licenses simultaneously, with bidding remaining open on all licenses until no bidder was willing to raise the bid on any license. Simultaneous open bidding allowed bidders to send messages to their rivals, telling them on which licenses to bid and which to avoid. This "code bidding" occurs when one bidder tags the last few digits of its bid with the market number of a related license. Such bids can help bidders coordinate a division of the licenses, and enforce the proposed division through targeted punishments. Often the meaning of a bid is clear without attaching a market number in the trailing digits. Such a "retaliating bid" need not end in a market number to warn off a rival from a contested market. We examine how extensively bidders signaled each other with retaliating bids and code bids in the DEF-block PCS spectrum auction held from August 1996 through January 1997. We find that {{only a small fraction of}} the bidders commonly used these signals. The price differences between those markets where signaling did and did not occur were negligible. However, bidders that used these <b>collusive</b> <b>bidding</b> strategies won more than 40 % of the spectrum for sale and paid significantly less for their overall winnings, suggesting that the indirect losses from code bidding and retaliation may be large.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Masters in Procurement and Supply Management, 2015. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 54). Procurement is the acquisition of goods, services or works from an outside external source and performance of Services by any contractual means. Public procurement means procurement using public funds. Public sector organizations acquire goods, services and works from third parties. The system or process of public procurement in Bangladesh has been evolved, modified and developed over time. Under the primary legislation PPA 2006, the Public Procurement Rules 2008 was framed and issued, which replaced the Public Procurement Regulations 2003 of purchasing, hiring or obtaining of goods, works or services by any contractual means. Corruption and poor governance are impeding Bangladesh's efforts to reduce its massive poverty by reducing economic growth and lowering the achievement of social objectives. Electronic procurement makes public contracting more accessible, more secure and more efficient. Through the web interface, procurement information becomes accessible and competition and transparency are enhanced - making <b>collusive</b> <b>bidding</b> difficult. Objective {{of this paper is}} to discuss the e-Government Procurement implementation, its prospects and challenges and recommends measures to be adopted in public procurement system in Bangladesh. For this purpose a Questionnaire survey has been conducted in LGED to gather primary data. In addition, Key Informant Interview has been conducted to collect invaluable opinions of some senior officers and concerned contractors; their perception regarding the impact of e-Procurement, the reasons behind and suitable suggestions to overcome the negative impacts. Implementation of e- Government Procurement will supplement the present government's vision for building a Digital Bangladesh by 2021. The idea of a virtual bidding process could save more than 15 % of the government's procurement costs, according to a World Bank study and it becomes easier to eradicate corruptions from the country. As the country marching forward for “Digital Bangladesh”, introducing the system of submitting the tender over internet is a very positive step. Basis on this study, it was found that For e-procurement solutions to be successful, tenderers have to find ways of easing the problems and making the implementation process smoother. This paper addressed both technical and non-technical issues. The main technical issues are infrastructure and skilled manpower. Obtaining the performance result of the e- GP system, the paper-based system can be replaced by e-GP. In Bangladesh, it can be a very effective tool to ensure transparency and accountability in the process of public procurement. Md. Nasir UddinM. Procurement and Supply Managemen...|$|E
