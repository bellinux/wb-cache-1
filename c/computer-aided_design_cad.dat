The paper presents the devices for transfer of a damaged printer part into a digital model by non-contact three-dimensional (3 D) digitization. The paper discusses the 3 D <b>computer-aided</b> <b>designing</b> (<b>CAD)</b> of a model with CAD software based on a digitized real part. The paper presents two proposals for spare part manufacturing: a) manufacturing by computer numerical control (CNC) milling, which is projected and programmed in computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software with regard to production potential of selected CNC machine tools; b) manufacturing by Rapid Prototyping (RP) technology. The article concludes with a comparison of the proposed methods of manufacturing of printer spare part in term of production time...|$|R
40|$|Discussion {{is often}} {{reported}} concerning potential links between <b>computer-aided</b> <b>designing</b> and creativity, {{but there is}} a lack of systematic enquiry to gather empirical evidence concerning such links. This paper reports an indication of findings from other research studies carried out in contexts beyond general education that have sought evidence relating CAD and creativity. It describes the establishment of a framework for gathering empirical evidence to support the analysis of links between CAD and creativity, via the observation of creative behaviours, which was developed from published literature largely relating to the area of cognitive psychology. It notes some initial research findings concerning the use of this framework in analysing the use of <b>CAD</b> in postgraduate <b>design</b> projects completed at Loughborough University. These results demonstrate the occurrence of creative behaviours in association with the use of <b>CAD</b> when <b>designing.</b> Finally the significance of these results is discussed within the wider context of design modelling.

25|$|Drafting or {{technical}} drawing is {{the means by}} which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but <b>computer-aided</b> <b>design</b> (<b>CAD)</b> programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.|$|E
25|$|Gerber {{is used in}} PCB {{fabrication}} data. PCBs {{are designed}} on a specialized electronic design automation (EDA) or a <b>computer-aided</b> <b>design</b> (<b>CAD)</b> system. The CAD systems output PCB fabrication data to allow fabrication of the board. This data typically contains a Gerber file for each image layer (copper layers, solder mask, legend or silk...). Gerber is also the standard image input format for all bare board fabrication equipment needing image data, such as photoplotters, legend printers, direct imagers or automated optical inspection (AOI) machines and for viewing reference images in different departments. For assembly the fabrication data contains the solder paste layers and the central locations of components to create the stencil and place and bond the components.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a preliminary protocol study of the cognitive behaviour of architectural designers during the design process. The aim is to better understand the similarities and differences in cognitive behaviour using Sequential Mixed Media (SMM) and Alternative Mixed Media (AMM) approaches, and how switching between media may impact on design processes. Two participants with at least one-year’s professional design experience and a Bachelor of Design degree, and competence in both sketching and <b>computer-aid</b> <b>design</b> (<b>CAD)</b> modelling participated in the study. Video recordings of participants working on different projects were coded using the Function-Behaviour-Structure (FBS) coding scheme. Participants were also interviewed and their explanations about their switching behaviours were categorised into three types: S→C, S/C↹R and C→S. Preliminary results indicate that switching between media may influence how designers identify problems and develop solutions. In particular, two design issues were identified.   These relate to the FBS coding scheme, where structure (S) and behaviour derived from structure (Bs), change to documentation (D) after switching from sketching to CAD modelling (S→C). These switches make it possible for designers to integrate both approaches into one design medium and facilitate their design processes in AMM design environments...|$|R

50|$|Although {{the process}} of design may be {{considered}} 'creative,' many analytical processes also take place. In fact, many industrial designers often use various design methodologies in their creative process. Some of the processes that are commonly used are user research, sketching, comparative product research, model making, prototyping and testing. These processes are best defined by the industrial designers and/or other team members. Industrial designers often utilize 3D software, <b>computer-aided</b> industrial <b>design</b> and <b>CAD</b> programs to move from concept to production. They may also build a prototype first and then use industrial CT scanning to test for interior defects and generate a CAD model.
