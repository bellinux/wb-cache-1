As it became increasingly clear the United States would not recognize the nascent First Philippine Republic, the Philippine–American War broke out, the First Republic was defeated, and the archipelago was administered under an Insular Government.

The timber for the frames was similarly not definitively determined, although one frame was probably of Amoora or of the Afzelia genus of the Fabaceae family. Afzelia is interesting in that the three main species A. africana, A. bipindensis and A. pachyloba are mostly found in a small part of Africa, stretching from the mid-western coast in a thin band towards the east coast and stopping short of it by a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>hundred</b> miles.|$|E

5|$|Unlike a {{significant}} number of registered breeds today, a horse cannot be registered as a Thoroughbred (with The Jockey Club registry) unless conceived by live cover, the witnessed natural mating of a mare and a stallion. Artificial insemination (AI) and embryo transfer (ET), though commonly used and allowable in many other horse breed registries, cannot be used with Thoroughbreds. One reason is that a greater possibility of error exists in assigning parentage with AI, and although DNA and blood testing eliminate many of those concerns, AI still requires more detailed record keeping. The main reason, however, may be economic; a stallion has a limited number of mares who can be serviced by live cover. Thus the practice prevents an oversupply of Thoroughbreds, although modern management still allows a stallion to live cover more mares in a season than was once thought possible. As an example, in 2008, the Australian stallion Encosta De Lago covered 227 mares. By allowing a stallion to cover only a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>hundred</b> mares a year rather than the couple of thousand possible with AI, it also preserves the high prices paid for horses of the finest or most popular lineages.|$|E

In addition, greater earthquakes may involve tsunami earthquakes (Satake 1994; Dutykh et al. 2012) and seafloor failures due to strong seafloor shaking which can generate additional tsunamis (Kawamura et al. 2014; Løvholt et al. 2015).|$|R

25|$|The {{transition}} to red grape varieties was slow.

In 1760, Louis-Léonard Fontémong, a Libournais négociant, planted what appears to be the first documented instance of Merlot in the region, in a vineyard that is now part of Château Rouget. However, white wine grapes continued to dominate the vineyards of Pomerol until the late 19th century when the higher prices of red clarets and the waning Dutch influence made red wine production more enticing. When the region received its full AOC status in 1936, the AOC regulation specifically outlawed the plantings of any white grape varieties in Pomerol.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a simple Higgs portal model in beyond {{the standard model}} scenario: an extra real gauge singlet scalar that couples to the Higgs. We calculate the higher-loop corrections to the {{cross section of the}} Higgsstrahlung process e^+e^- → Z h, along with the tri-Higgs coupling and the wave-function renormalization. We find noticeable contribution to the total Higgsstrahlung cross section, especially coming from two-loop diagrams. We also find that the correction to the tri-Higgs coupling is complex when this extra scalar is lighter than half of the center of mass energy. It indicates a new source of CP violation. In the region of this extra scalar being lighter than a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> GeVs, we argue that the higher-loop calculation is a more reliable approach than the effective field theory calculation.

With the distance closing and Graylings combat information center still trying to decide on the best way of avoiding a collision, Graylings commanding officer, Commander Richard Self, tried to change course and to surface, but the attempts were thwarted by Graylings momentum. Grayling collided with the upper structure of Novomoskovsk, which suffered a large scratch on her starboard bow. The American submarine limped away also with minor damage. The American submarine was repaired and remained in service until her decommissioning in 1997. Novomoskovsk also returned to service, and after a major upgrade she is expected to stay in the Russian Navy until 2020.|$|E

Specifically, we introduce a constant-propagation technique to simplify the formulas submitted to the CNF SAT solver; we present a new proof-based iterative abstraction technique for bounded model checking; and we show how the two techniques can be combined. The experimental results demonstrate our ability to handle circuit with several thousands state elements reaching bounds nearing 1, 000. I...|$|R
