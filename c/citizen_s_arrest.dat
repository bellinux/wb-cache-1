40|$|Inactivation of Mec 1, {{the budding}} yeast ATR, {{results in a}} {{permanent}} <b>S</b> phase <b>arrest</b> followed by chromosome breakage and cell death during G 2 /M. The <b>S</b> phase <b>arrest</b> is proposed to stem from a defect in Mec 1 -mediated degradation of Sml 1, a conserved inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), causing a severe depletion in cellular dNTP pools. Here, the casual link between the <b>S</b> phase <b>arrest,</b> Sml 1, and dNTP-levels is examined using a temperature sensitive mec 1 mutant. In addition to <b>S</b> phase <b>arrest,</b> thermal inactivation of Mec 1 leads to constitutively high levels of Sml 1 and an <b>S</b> phase <b>arrest.</b> Expression of a novel suppressor, GIS 2, a conserved mRNA binding zinc finger protein, rescues the arrest without down-regulating Sml 1 levels. The dNTP pool in mec 1 is reduced by ∼ 17 % and GIS 2 expression restores it, but only partially, to ∼ 93 % of a control. We infer that the permanent S phase block following Mec 1 inactivation can be uncoupled from its role in Sml 1 down-regulation. Furthermore, unexpectedly modest effects of mec 1 and GIS 2 on dNTP levels suggest that the <b>S</b> phase <b>arrest</b> is unlikely to result from a severe depletion of dNTP pool as assumed, but a heightened sensitivity to small changes in its availability...|$|R

Although current {{studies have focused on}} the cyclin-dependent protein kinase Cdc 2 p that is regulated by these checkpoint kinases, other aspects of their functions at the onset of <b>S</b> phase <b>arrest</b> have not been fully understood. In this study, we use genome-wide DNA microarray analyses to show that HU-induced change of expression profiles in synchronized G 2 cells occurs specifically at the onset of <b>S</b> phase <b>arrest.</b> Induction of many core environmental stress response genes and repression of ribosomal genes happen during <b>S</b> phase <b>arrest.</b> Significantly, peak expression level of the MluI-like cell cycle box (MCB) -cluster (G 1) genes is maintained at the onset of <b>S</b> phase <b>arrest</b> in a Rad 3 p- and Cds 1 p-dependent manner. Expression level maintenance of the MCB-cluster is mediated through the accumulation of Rep 2 p, a putative transcriptional activator of the MBF complex.

Repression of the FKH-cluster genes is mediated through the decreased levels of one of the putative forkhead transcription factors, Sep 1 p, but not Fkh 2 p.

40|$|The {{replication}} checkpoint (or 'S-M checkpoint') control prevents progression into mitosis when DNA replication is incomplete. Caffeine {{has been}} known for some time to have the capacity to override the S-M checkpoint in animal cells. We show here that caffeine also disrupts the S-M checkpoint in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. By contrast, no comparable effects of caffeine on the S. pombe DNA damage checkpoint were seen. <b>S.</b> pombe cells <b>arrested</b> in early <b>S</b> phase and then exposed to caffeine lost viability rapidly as they attempted to enter mitosis, which was accompanied by tyrosine dephosphorylation of Cdc 2. Despite this, the caffeine-induced loss of viability was not blocked in a temperature-sensitive cdc 2 mutant incubated at the restrictive temperature, although catastrophic mitosis was prevented under these conditions. This suggests that, in addition to S-M checkpoint control, a caffeine-sensitive function may be important for maintenance of cell viability during <b>S</b> phase <b>arrest.</b> The lethality of a combination of caffeine with the DNA replication inhibitor hydroxyurea was suppressed by overexpression of Cds 1 or Chk 1, protein kinases previously implicated in S-M checkpoint control and recovery from <b>S</b> phase <b>arrest.</b> In addition, the same combination of drugs was specifically tolerated in cells overexpressing either of two novel S. pombe genes isolated in a cDNA library screen.

40|$|Long-term {{exposure}} to harmful carcinogens like benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) {{are linked to}} lung cancer. Benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE), the ultimate carcinogen produced by BaP bioactivation, is believed {{to play an important}} role in lung carcinogenesis. The tumor suppressor protein is p 53 signals cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis in response to BPDE-induced damage. However, physiological {{exposure to}} BPDE fails to activate p 53. Although the bioactive principle of turmeric spice, curcumin, shows promising effects against BPDE-induced carcinogenesis, its exact mode of action remains unclear. Therefore the aim of this dissertation was to investigate whether curcumin prevents BPDE-induced DNA damage by regulating p 53 -mediated cellular responses in A 549 /LXSN (p 53 +) and A 549 /E 6 (p 53 -) cells. I hypothesize that curcumin may reduce BPDE-induced DNA damage by lowering the threshold of p 53 activation, thereby inducing p 53 -mediated mechanisms. Curcumin pretreatment reduced BPDEDNA adducts in a p 53 -dependent manner. However, p 53 -regulated proteins XPC and DDB 2 did not change with curcumin pretreatment and p 53 -expression. Curcumin pretreatment did not change the overall repair rate in p 53 + cells. Curcumin pretreatment, p 53 -expression, and BPDE exposure did not significantly change glutathione-S-transferase (GST) levels or activity as well as glutathione (GSH) levels. Curcumin increased levels of p 53, phosphorylated p 53 at Ser 15 (P-p 53 S 15), and CDKN 1 A, but decreased phosphorylated retinoblastoma at Ser 807 / 811 (P-pRbS 807 / 811) in p 53 + cells with lower BPDE exposure. Curcumin and BPDE increased and decreased PpRbS 807 / 811, respectively, in p 53 - cells. BPDE induced <b>S</b> phase <b>arrest</b> in both cell lines. P 53 + curcumin pretreated cells escaped <b>S</b> phase <b>arrest</b> earlier with 300 nM BPDE in contrast to BPDE treatment alone. Yet, curcumin did not change <b>S</b> phase <b>arrest</b> in p 53 + cells treated with 50 or 100 nM BPDE. P 53 - cells did not escape <b>S</b> phase <b>arrest</b> 24 h after low (50 and 100 nM) BPDE exposures; p 53 - curcumin pretreated cells entered <b>S</b> phase <b>arrest</b> earlier. Phosphorylated CHK 1 Ser 345 (pCHKS 345) levels, an indicator of <b>S</b> phase <b>arrest,</b> was higher in p 53 - cells than p 53 + cells; curcumin increased pCHK 1 Ser 345. Curcumin also induced apoptosis earlier in p 53 - cells exposed to 300 nM BPDE. Therefore, this dissertation shows that curcumin prevents BPDE-induced DNA damage by activating a host of mechanisms independent of p 53 expression...|$|R

40|$|The United States is in {{the midst}} of {{demographic}} transformation that will continue to diversify the cultural, ethnic, racial, and linguistic landscape of the country. Within the last decade, millions of immigrant families have emigrated to the U. S. to escape tremendous hardships in their native countries. These families are guided by the hope of creating a stable, safe, and comfortable environment for their children. Unfortunately, the pathway to citizenship and authorized entry into the U. S. is convoluted (Kremer, Moccio,& Hammell, 2009) and families are frequently assigned wait times that can last several years (U. S. Department of State, 2013). These very long wait times are an unfortunate reality for several families, which is one of the many reasons some families enter the U. S. without authorization. Upon arrival into the U. S., many immigrant families experience anti-immigrant attitudes, prejudicial law enforcement practices, and feel socially isolated. The U. S. born children of these immigrant families are at risk for being separated from their parents who lack authorized resident status. In this regard, over 100, 000 parents of U. <b>S.</b> <b>citizen</b> children were deported between 1998 and 2007 (U. S. Department of Homeland Security, 2012). However, little is known about how these children cope with the loss of their parents. To date, no research has been conducted that measures the psychosocial impact of parental absence because of aggressive immigration enforcement. Thus, a patent need exists for research on the psychosocial implications of parental absence in a child's life because of deportation. This study addressed the psychosocial impact of parental loss because of aggressive immigration enforcement. All participants of this study completed a demographic questionnaire and two technically adequate standardized psychosocial assessments that measured emotional symptoms. A two-group independent samples design was employed that included a sample of youth who were homeless because their parents were impacted by immigration and customs enforcement and a sample of youth who were homeless for other reasons. The present study sought to answer the following questions: Are there significant differences in emotional symptoms between youth who are living on their own as a result of immigration enforcement in comparison to those youth who are living on their own for other reasons? Are there significant differences in emotional symptoms between U. <b>S.</b> <b>citizen</b> and non-U. <b>S.</b> <b>citizen</b> youth? Do significant differences exist in perceptions of school climate between youth who are living on their own as a result of immigration enforcement in comparison to those youth who are living on their own for other reasons? Is the quality of relationships with parents significantly different between youth who are living on their own as a result of immigration enforcement in comparison to those youth who are living on their own for other reasons? Do significant differences exist in emotional symptoms between youth whose parents have been impacted by immigration and customs enforcement (ICE; Impacted by ICE group) in comparison to youth whose parents have been impacted by immigration enforcement for other reasons (Homeless for Other Reasons group) ? Lastly, are there significant differences in perception of school climate between U. <b>S.</b> <b>citizen</b> and non-U. <b>S.</b> <b>citizen</b> youth? Results of this study did not reveal significant differences in emotional symptoms between the Impacted by ICE group and the Homeless for Other Reasons group. However, in terms of how they perceived their relationships with their parents, the Impacted by Immigration group reported more positive relations with their parents. There were significant differences regarding perceptions of school climate between the Impacted by ICE and Homeless for Other Reasons groups.
