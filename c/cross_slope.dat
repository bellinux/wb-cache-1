25|$|The {{cross section}} of a roadway can be {{considered}} a representation of what one would see if an excavator dug a trench across a roadway, showing the number of lanes, their widths and <b>cross</b> <b>slopes,</b> as well as {{the presence or absence of}} shoulders, curbs, sidewalks, drains, ditches, and other roadway features.|$|R
25|$|<b>Cross</b> <b>slope</b> {{describes}} {{the slope of}} a roadway perpendicular to the centerline. If a road were completely level, water would drain off it very slowly. This would create problems with hydroplaning, and ice accumulation in cold weather.|$|E
25|$|Superelevation {{slopes of}} 4 to 10% are applied {{in order to}} aid motorists in safely {{traversing}} these sections, while maintaining vehicle speed throughout {{the length of the}} curve. An upper bound of 12% was chosen {{to meet the demands of}} construction and maintenance practices, as well as to limit the difficulty of driving a steeply cross-sloped curve at low speeds. In areas that receive significant snow and ice, most agencies use a maximum <b>cross</b> <b>slope</b> of 6 to 8%. While steeper <b>cross</b> <b>slope</b> makes it difficult to traverse the slope at low speed when the surface is icy, and when accelerating from zero with warm tyres on the ice, lower <b>cross</b> <b>slope</b> increases the risk of loss-of-control at high speeds, especially when the surface is icy. Since the consequence of high speed skidding is much worse than that of sliding inward at a low speed, sharp curves have the benefit of greater net safety when designers select up to 8% superelevation, instead of 4%. A lower slope of 4% is commonly used on urban roadways where speeds are lower, and where a steeper slope would raise the outside road edge above adjacent terrain.|$|E
25|$|Virtually all roads {{require some}} form of {{maintenance}} before {{they come to the}} end of their service life. Pro-active agencies use pavement management techniques to continually monitor road conditions and schedule preventive maintenance treatments as needed to prolong the lifespan of their roads. Technically advanced agencies monitor the road network surface condition with sophisticated equipment such as laser/inertial Profilometers. These measurements include road curvature, <b>cross</b> <b>slope,</b> asperity, roughness, rutting and texture. This data is fed into a pavement management system, which recommends the best maintenance or construction treatment to correct the damage that has occurred.|$|E

2500|$|Improperly banked road curves {{increase}} the risk of run-off-road and head-on crashes. A 2% deficiency in superelevation (say, 4% superelevation on a curve that should have 6%) can be expected to increase crash frequency by 6%, and a 5% deficiency will increase it by 15%. Up until now, highway engineers have been without efficient tools to identify improperly banked curves and to design relevant mitigating road actions. A modern profilograph can provide data of both road curvature and <b>cross</b> <b>slope</b> (angle of incline). A practical demonstration of how to evaluate improperly banked turns was developed in the EU Roadex III project. [...] See the linked referenced document below.|$|E

40|$|Yield {{data from}} three {{experiments}} of maize single cross trials grown at 5 to 8 locations in 1994, 1995, and 1996 were analyzed for stability using regression methods. Only single crosses grown in all locations and years (environments) {{were included in}} the analyses. Effects for environments, genotypes, genotype x environment, heterogeneity of regression (slopes), and deviations from regression were tested for significance. Slopes and deviation from regression were calculated for each single <b>cross</b> and <b>slopes</b> were tested for equality to 0. 0 and 1. 0. Slopes sums of squares were subdivided into sums of squares due to concurrence and non-concurrence. Subsets of each experiment were also analyzed to examine whether stability changed in environments stratified by mean yield levels or by years. The analysis of one experiment revealed significant differences among single <b>cross</b> <b>slopes</b> and non-concurrence.

50|$|<b>Cross</b> <b>slope,</b> {{cross fall}} or camber is a {{geometric}} feature of pavement surfaces: the transverse slope {{with respect to}} the horizon. It is a very important safety factor. <b>Cross</b> <b>slope</b> is provided to provide a drainage gradient so that water will run off the surface to a drainage system such as a street gutter or ditch. Inadequate <b>cross</b> <b>slope</b> will contribute to aquaplaning. On straight sections of normal two-lane roads, the pavement cross section is usually highest in the center and drains to both sides. In horizontal curves, the <b>cross</b> <b>slope</b> is banked into superelevation to reduce steering effort and lateral force required to go around the curve. All water drains {{to the inside of the}} curve. If the <b>cross</b> <b>slope</b> magnitude oscillates within 1 - 25 m, the body and payload of high (heavy) vehicles will experience high roll vibration.|$|E

5000|$|Pavement <b>cross</b> <b>slope</b> and grade: <b>Cross</b> <b>slope</b> is {{the extent}} to which the {{cross-section}} of a road resembles an upturned U. Higher cross slopes allow water to drain more easily. Grade is the steepness of the road at a particular point, which affects both drainage and force exerted by the vehicle on the road. Vehicles are less likely to aquaplane while traveling uphill, and far more likely to do so at the trough of two connected hills where water tends to pool. The resultant of <b>cross</b> <b>slope</b> and grade is called drainage gradient or [...] "resulting grade". Most road design manuals require that the drainage gradient in all road sections must exceed 0.5%, in order to avoid a thick water film during and after rainfall. Areas where the drainage gradient may fall below the minimum limit 0.5% are found at the entrance and exit of banked outer curves. These hot spots are typically less than 1% of the road length, but a large share of all skid crashes occur there. One method for the road designer to reduce the crash risk is to move the <b>cross</b> <b>slope</b> transition from the outer curve and to a straight road section, where lateral forces are lower. If possible, the <b>cross</b> <b>slope</b> transition should be placed in a slight up- or downgrade, thereby avoiding that the drainage gradient drops to zero. The UK road design manual actually calls for placement of a <b>cross</b> <b>slope</b> transition in an artificially created slope, if needed. In some cases, permeable asphalt or concrete can be used to improve drainage in the <b>cross</b> <b>slope</b> transitions.|$|E
