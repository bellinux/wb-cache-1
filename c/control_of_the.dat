5|$|According to {{a legend}} King Indradyumma was {{directed}} by Lord Jagannath in a dream to build a temple for him which he did as directed. However, according to historical records the temple was started some time during the 12th century by King Chodaganga of the Eastern Ganga dynasty. It was completed by his descendant, Anangabhima Deva, in the 12th century. The wooden images of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra were then deified here. The temple was under the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hindu rulers up to 1558. Then, when Orissa was occupied by the Afghan Nawab of Bengal, it was brought under the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Afghan General Kalapahad. Following {{the defeat of the}} Afghan king by Raja Mansingh, the General of Mughal emperor Akbar, the temple became part of the Mughal empire till 1751. Subsequently, it was under the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marathas till 1803. During the British Raj, the Puri Raja was entrusted with its management until 1947.|$|E
5|$|After a few days, {{the main}} {{thrust of the}} {{offensive}} was halted south of Rimini by strong resistance and severe weather, and the British and Indian flanking forces began to push westwards, taking the frontline towards San Marino. On 17 September the 4th Indian Infantry Division attacked forces of the 278.

The city was captured by the afternoon of 20 September, and the 4th Indian Division left the country on the 21st, leaving it under the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local defence forces.|$|E

5|$|After Æthelstan's death, {{the men of}} York {{immediately}} {{chose the}} Viking king of Dublin, Olaf Guthfrithson (or his cousin, Anlaf Cuaran), as their king, and Anglo-Saxon <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> north, seemingly made safe by the victory of Brunanburh, collapsed. The reigns of Æthelstan's half-brothers Edmund (939–946) and Eadred (946–955) were largely devoted to regaining control. Olaf seized the east midlands, leading {{to the establishment of}} a frontier at Watling Street. In 941 Olaf died, and Edmund took back <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> east midlands, and then York in 944. Following Edmund's death York again switched back to Viking control, and it was only when the Northumbrians finally drove out their Norwegian Viking king Eric Bloodaxe in 954 and submitted to Eadred that Anglo-Saxon <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole of England was finally restored.|$|E
5|$|As Democrats took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House in 1875, Randall was {{considered}} among the candidates for Speaker of the House. Many in the caucus hesitated, however, believing Randall to be too close to railroad interests and uncertain on the money question. His leadership in the Salary Grab may have harmed him, as well. Randall was also occupied by an intra-party battle with William A. Wallace for <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pennsylvania Democratic Party. Wallace, who had been elected to the United States Senate in 1874, was weakened by rumors {{that he had taken}} bribes from the railroads while a member of the State Senate. Randall wanted <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Democratic machine statewide, and the Wallace faction's vulnerability on the bribery rumors provided the opportunity. In January 1875, he had friends in the state legislature begin an investigation into Wallace's clique, which ultimately turned state Democratic leaders against the senator. At the state Democratic convention in September 1875, Randall (with the help of his old ally, Squire McMullen) triumphed, putting his men in <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state party.|$|E

5|$|Between 15 and 20 August, the U.S. {{carriers}} {{covered the}} delivery of fighter and bomber aircraft to the newly opened Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. This small, hard-won airfield was a critical point in the entire island chain, and both military sides strategically considered that <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airbase offered potential <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local battle area airspace. In fact, Henderson Field and the aircraft based upon it soon resulted in telling effects on the movement of Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands and in the attrition of Japanese air forces in the South Pacific Area. Historically, Allied control of Henderson Field became the key factor in the entire battle for Guadalcanal.|$|E

5|$|During gameplay, players {{attempt to}} create goal-scoring {{opportunities}} through individual <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ball, such as by dribbling, passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.|$|E
