40|$|When Pollution Prevention Opportunity Assessments (P 2 OAs) were {{launched}} at the Hanford Site {{during the summer}} of 1994, the first <b>comment</b> <b>received</b> from those using them expressed the desire for a method to report assessments electronically. As a temporary measure, macros were developed for use on word processing systems, but a more formal database was obviously needed. Additionally, increased DOE and Washington state reporting requirements for pollution prevention suggested that a database system would streamline the reporting process. The Pollution Prevention Group of Westinghouse Hanford Company (WHC) contracted with the Data Automation Engineering Department from ICF Kaiser Hanford Company (ICFKH) to develop the system. The scope was to develop a database that will track P 2 OAs conducted by the facilities and contractors at the Hanford Site. It will also track pollution prevention accomplishments that are not the result of P 2 OAs and document a portion of the Process Waste Assessments conducted in the past. To accommodate the above criteria, yet complete the system in a timely manner, the Pollution Prevention Successes Database (P 2 SDb) is being implemented in three phases. The first phase will automate the worksheets to provide both input and output of the data associated with the worksheets. The second phase will automate standard summary reports and ad hoc reports. The third phase will provide automated searching of the database to facilitate the sharing of pollution prevention experiences among various users. This User`s Guide addresses only the Phase 1 system...|$|E
40|$|Associated Biota of Totten Inlet. This {{document}} {{was described by}} Bill Gardiner (MEC) as “a literature review that attempts {{to answer the question}} of nature and extent of impacts to the water column and water column resources ” associated with operation of the Taylor Resources proposed mussel culture rafts in North Totten Inlet. This document incorporates the results of recent fieldwork conducted by Aquatic Environmental Sciences, the Pacific Shellfish Institute (PSI) and others within South Puget Sound (SPS) Totten Inlet. The October 2004 literature review was prepared for ITRC review, to assist Thurston County with determining whether there are any remaining significant data gaps prior to the County’s use of the document to prepare the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the project, and make permit decisions. In the event that the ITRC identifies data gaps, MEC proposes to develop a study plan, conduct fieldwork, and prepare (or revise) their technical report to respond to these questions. The ITRC reviewed the October 2004 literature review in the context of: 1) the Findings and Conclusions of the Thurston County Hearing Examiner (June 1999), and 2) prior recommendations of the ITRC that identify information requirements for preparation of the EIS; in particular, the Response of the ITRC to Thurston County and Taylor Resources regarding Letters of <b>Comment</b> <b>Received</b> in March 2002 during the Process to “Refresh ” the Scope of the EIS (August 20, 2002).

40|$|Proceedings of the 2001 Georgia Water Resources Conference, April 26 and 27, 2001, Athens, Georgia. In February 2000, EPA Region 4 {{proposed}} a mercury TMDL for the Savannah River, precipitated by a 303 (d) listing by the State of Georgia based on consumption guidelines for mercury in fish tissue. In December, 2000, EPA Region 4 re-proposed this TMDL {{in response to}} the large volume of <b>comment</b> <b>received</b> on its earlier proposal. In support of the TMDL, EPA sampled and analyzed mercury in fish tissue, sediments, water, soil, and effluents from various NPDES dischargers along Savannah River. This paper provides a summary of the major technical and legal concerns over the recently re-proposed mercury TMDL for the Savannah River and the data collection and analysis efforts used in support of this TMDL. In particular, the authors believe that EPA had no legal basis to propose the TMDL because impairment of the Savannah River for fishing was never demonstrated. In the development of the TMDL, EPA did not follow its own guidance for deriving ambient water quality criteria for the protection of human health. This paper concludes with a discussion of the impact of these recent developments on NPDES dischargers to the Savannah River. Sponsored and Organized by: U. S.
