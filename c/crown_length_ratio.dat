Sample trees from each stocking and rectangularity combination were harvested at age 7 years and assessed for the commercially important wood properties of bow, as an indication of growth strain, shrinkage and basic density. <b>Crown</b> <b>length</b> <b>ratio</b> was used as an indicator of stand vigour and clear wood availability. Furthermore comment is made on the financial ramifications of wide inter-row spacing. Stocking and rectangularity significantly influenced bow but not shrinkage or basic density. Reducing within-row spacing to 2 m with a larger between-row-space of 6 m had minimal affect on wood properties. Reducing the number of rows, whilst still retaining a commercial stocking, reduces the establishment costs and increases the ease of mechanical harvesting without adversely affecting log value...|$|E
40|$|Session: Periodontal ResearchObjectives: To {{investigate}} {{the characteristics of}} periodontal soft tissue appearance {{and their relationship to}} upper anterior tooth shape and gingival clinical parameters in a Chinese population. Methods: The study will recruit 30 systemic and periodontally healthy subjects, aged 18 - 35, from the Prince Philip Dental Hospital. Periodontal probing depth (PD), bleeding on probing (BOP) and tooth 13 - 23 attached gingiva width (GW) and crown width to <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> <b>ratio</b> (CW/CL) will be measured and analyzed. Results: Thus far a total of 20 subjects (9 males) with the mean age of 22. 58 (SD= 3. 93) have been recruited during the first 3 months of the study. The mean PD of these subjects was 1. 66 mm (SD= 0. 28) and mean BOP was 16. 5 % (SD= 0. 11). The mean GW was 5. 49 mm (SD= 1. 34).

30|$|Studies on xylem {{formation}} {{have focused}} on the role of plant growth regulators, especially indole acetic acid (IAA), in wood formation [9, 11 – 15]. It has been assumed that IAA is actively synthesized in elongating shoot apices and is transported to the stem cambium, where it then stimulates tracheid production. Based on these studies, IAA is believed to be an important regulator in xylem formation in conifers. In a previous study on mature sugi trees (Cryptomeria japonica, Japanese cedar), we reported that the distance from the crown and the <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> <b>ratio</b> (CL ratio) affect the IAA amounts in the cambial-region tissues in the stem [16]. As the trees in sugi plantations grow from juvenile to mature trees, the lower branches naturally wither and fall due to competition between trees, and the crown then moves from a lower position to a higher position in the trunk, and CL ratio, i.e., the ratio between the crown length to the total tree height, decreases. Based on the results obtained in the previous study, it can be assumed that in juvenile trees, in which the lower branches near the ground are alive and the CL ratios are close to 100  %, the absolute values and longitudinal variation patterns of the IAA amounts might be quite different from those in mature trees. These ideas support the concept of “crown-formed wood” described above. To elucidate the processes involved in juvenile wood formation, the IAA amounts in the cambial-region tissues in juvenile trees should be examined and compared to those in mature trees. In addition, the effect of IAA amounts on xylem formation in juvenile trees and the variation of wood properties in juvenile and mature trees should be evaluated. In radial variation of wood properties of sugi, variation of microfibril angle (MFA) is very important, because wood density in juvenile wood is larger than mature wood. However, there have not been enough quantitative studies on IAA in cambial-region tissues in juvenile sugi trees.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Reduced bone height, {{elevated}} masticatory {{force and}} increased <b>crown</b> height-implant <b>length</b> <b>ratio</b> are all associated with dental implants of short length {{placed in the}} posterior mandible or maxilla. Consequently, dental practitioners generally aim to increase the bone to implant surface area contact by choosing wider diameters for short implants. With implant designs being driven at times by market demands rather than basic scientific research, the influence of different designs on the stress characteristics in the surrounding bone becomes an important issue. This research uses the Finite Element Method to evaluate the stress characteristics within the posterior maxilla for four distinctly different short implant designs (Bicon, Neodent, Nobel Biocare and Straumann) subject to unfavourable <b>crown</b> height-implant <b>length</b> <b>ratio</b> and masticatory forces. Material and Methods: The four bone-implant systems are modelled using three-dimensional hexahedral and wedge shaped brick elements. Assumptions made in the analyses are: temperature sensitive elements are used to replicate the torque within the abutment screw; <b>crown</b> height-implant <b>length</b> <b>ratio</b> is 2 : 1; 50 % osseointegration between bone and implant; and, linear elastic material properties of bone. Results and Conclusion: Bicon's thread design causes larger stress variances from minimum to maximum when compared to all other systems. The combination of a decreased diameter and increased taperage of the Neodent design increases the stress level {{when compared to the}} Bicon implant. Nobel Biocare's rounded implant thread crest design and reduced thread pitch produces a preferred smoothed out stress profile. Straumann's increased thread pitch gives elevated stress in cancellous bone. Generally, stresses are concentrated in the crestal bone region next to the implant neck, attributable to the combination of <b>crown</b> height-implant <b>length</b> <b>ratio</b> and the inclined nature of the masticatory force.

40|$|Purpose: Elevated bite {{forces and}} reduced bone densities and {{dimensions}} associated with posterior {{regions of the}} maxilla cause relatively high failure rates when short dental implants are placed to substitute missing teeth. This study uses the finite element method to evaluate four distinctly different short implant designs (Bicon, Neodent, Nobel Biocare, and Straumann) for their influences on the von Mises stress characteristics within the posterior maxilla. Materials and Methods: Finite element models of the supporting bone and tooth crowns are developed based on computed tomography data, and implant geometries are obtained from manufacturers' catalogs. The finite element models are meshed using three-dimensional hexahedral and wedge-shaped brick elements. Assumptions made in the analyses are: linear elastic material properties for bone, 50 % osseointegration between bone and implant, and <b>crown</b> height-implant <b>length</b> <b>ratio</b> of 2 : 1. Results: Bicon's neck indentation produced reduced stress in the cortical bone {{when compared with the}} Nobel Biocare and Straumann systems. The increased taper of the Neodent design decreased the stress level in cancellous bone. Nobel Biocare's rounded thread crest and reduced thread pitch produced a smoother stress profile. Straumann's increased thread pitch produced elevated stress in the cancellous bone. Generally, stresses were concentrated in the crestal bone region around the implant neck, attributable to the inclined nature of the masticatory force. Conclusion: Nobel Biocare and Bicon systems are recommended for use in type 4 cancellous and cortical bone, respectively.

30|$|We {{selected}} trees {{during the}} summer of the year following each fire based on categorical bins in an effort to assess a full range of tree and injury characteristics. Specific categories included DBH classes from 25 to 50  cm, 51 to 76  cm, and ≥ 77  cm; crown kill ranges ≤ 10 %, 11 to 50 %, 51 to 60 %, 61 to 70 %, 71 to 80 %, 81 to 90 %, and 91 to 100 %; and cambium kill categorical ratings of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Any tree that survived at least one year post fire was monitored annually for five years or until death, then for 10  years post mortality. Only trees with 10  years of post-mortality observations were used in this analysis. One year post fire, we assessed tree and injury characteristics including species, DBH, tree height, pre-fire <b>crown</b> <b>length,</b> number of red turpentine beetle (RTB; Dendroctonus valens LeConte) pitch tubes for pines, and fire injury. We quantified fire injury by recording cambium kill rating (CKR; ordinal variable between 0 and 4 describing the number of dead cambium samples at each quadrant of the tree base), <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> killed (all species; observed portion of the crown with dead tissue from fire injury), and <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> scorched (Jeffrey pine and ponderosa pine only; observed portion of the crown with dead needles, but living buds and branches). Lengths were measured using a clinometer or laser hypsometer to the nearest 0.3  m. We calculated pre-fire <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> and <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> killed from the estimated pre-fire crown base height, post-fire crown base height, and tree height measurements. The pre-fire crown was estimated using the methods described in Ryan (1982), by visually reconstructing the crown to its pre-fire state based on crown scorch and fine branch structure. We converted <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> killed into percent <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> killed, by dividing the <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> killed by the pre-fire <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> to create a crown injury variable (CI).

Snag persistence may be influenced by whether it is in isolation or in a group of living trees (Mitchell and Preisler 1998; Russell et al. 2006). We therefore also assessed whether each snag was in a stand that had been salvage logged (Sal) and if the snag was surrounded by live conifers (protected by green conifers; PGC) as binary categories (0 [*]=[*]no and 1 [*]=[*]yes).

The need to predict mature tooth dimensions, while the tooth considered is still in development, is a drawback to use this staging technique for dental age estimations. Using the fully mature <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> as a predictor for the future root length could provide a tool for undisputable staging. The {{aim of this study}} was first to measure the <b>crown</b> and root <b>length</b> of fully mature third molars and second to investigate whether the <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> {{could be used as a}} predictor of the root length, in order to classify the observed root length as a proportion of the future mature root. The <b>crown</b> and root <b>lengths</b> of all present third molars were digitally measured on dental panoramic radiographs of 1, 000 subjects. The included subjects were equally distributed in gender, and their age ranged between 22 and 40 years. Two occlusal borders, the cement enamel junction and the root apices, were defined as landmarks for standardized measurements. Regression models with root length as response and <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> as predictor were established and revealed low R 2 and high RMSE values. Due to the small explained variance by the prediction models and the high variation in prediction errors, the observed <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> cannot be used to predict the final root length of a developing third molar. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Statement of Problem: Tongue thrust and/or its {{consequent}} swallowing pattern are {{amongst the}} parafunctional habits that {{have always been}} considered as etiological factors for dental disorders by different investigators. Purpose: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the prevalence of tongue thrusting and the incidence of periodontal disorders associated with this habit among patients referred to the Department of Periodontology, School of Dentistry, Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Material and Methods: Two hundred and eighty patients, undergoing first phase of periodontal therapy, were selected. Among them, those who had tongue thrusting were diagnosed and periodontal indices (probing depth, gingival recession, spacing and gingival enlargement) were measured. Also, crown-root ratio was assessed for each anterior tooth. Results: Tongue thrusting was seen in 27. 3 %of patients, whereas 29. 8 % and 33. 8 % of them showed an increase in periodontal pocket depths in their upper and lower jaws,respectively. Gingival recession was found in the upper jaw in 12. 98 % and in the lowerjaw in 49. 35 % of the cases. <b>Crown</b> to root <b>length</b> <b>ratio</b> in 24. 6 % of the upper incisors and 35. 1 % of the lower incisors were found to be higher than normal. Spacing was observed between the incisors in 31. 2 % and 41. 6 % of the patients in the upper and lower jaws, respectively. Finally 31. 2 % of the patients showed gingival enlargement. Conclusion: The results of the present study revealed a considerable increase in the prevalence of various periodontal diseases among these subjects. To minimize the clinical problems of such patients, prevention of periodontal diseases through excellent oral hygiene and regular dental visits are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Pinus halepensis Mill. is a Mediterranean pioneer forest {{species with}} shade {{intolerance}} features. The {{purpose of this}} study is to better understand how stand fertility and allelopathic properties of adult trees influence shade acclimation of saplings. Crown growth and morphological plasticity were studied under different light, fertilization, and allelopathic conditions in a nursery experiment. We tested whether shade-acclimation capacity increases with fertilization, and is affected by autotoxicity due to pine leachates. We examined stem diameter, and <b>crown</b> characteristics (<b>length,</b> width, shape and density) in a factorial experiment with two levels for each tested factor: light (full and 20 % reduced light), fertilization (low and high rate of NPK fertilizer) and allelopathy (control and allelopathic leachates uptake). In our study, shading induced a significantly higher <b>crown</b> <b>length,</b> width and surface. Fertilization strongly increased <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> and vertical expended crown shape (the ratio crown length/crown width). Leachates uptake reduced <b>crown</b> <b>length</b> and density, highlighting an autotoxicity phenomenon. We concluded that P. halepensis saplings presented a shade avoiding syndrome and that the crown shade-acclimation response increased with fertilization but was severely compromised by autotoxicity. We finally discuss the role of fertilization and allelopathy in early P. halepensis acclimation ability...|$|R
