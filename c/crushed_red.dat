25|$|The {{figure in}} the drawing relates to a woman seated in the lower left {{foreground}} of the painting. Included in the study are narrative details such as the nails of the cross, held in her left hand, and the crown of thorns in her right. Although the drawing's attribution has been doubted, it is now accepted as authentic. The elaboration of the plaited hair suggests that the drawing was made from life using a young girl as the model. The drawing was made in three stages: first it was lightly laid down in black chalk, then gone over with pen and light bistre, and finally drawn over completely with a finer pen and darker ink. Lateral strokes were placed at the bottom to indicate the ground plane, and touches of white body color were added to details of the figure. Rare for a drawing by Michelangelo is the pink ground, in this case achieved by rubbing <b>crushed</b> <b>red</b> chalk onto the paper.|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, the University of Bordeaux asked 54 {{undergraduate}} students to test {{two glasses of}} wine: one red, one white. The participants described the red as [...] "jammy" [...] and commented on its <b>crushed</b> <b>red</b> fruit. [...] The participants failed to recognize that both wines were from the same bottle. [...] The only difference was that one had been colored red with a flavorless dye.|$|E
2500|$|While Tavel rosé can be {{made using}} the saignee and skin-contact method, the {{tradition}} {{in the region is}} to do a type of co-ferment with both red and white grapes that combines elements of both methods. The grapes are loaded, whole clusters, into a tank all together where under the gravity of their own weight the grapes are gently pressed and the juice trickles down to the bottom. There the juice receives its period of brief skin contact with the <b>crushed</b> <b>red</b> skins on the bottom before the lightly colored free-run juice is then drained off, like a saignee, and the wine then fermented as normal. This method produces what Karen MacNeil describes as [...] "rugged wines with robust, spicy berry flavor." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1860, Frederic Church {{made his}} initial {{acquisition}} of a 126-acre (50.99 ha) farm, which he developed into a ferme ornée, an ornamental farm. [...] Around Cosy Cottage, a profitable 15.5 acre (6.3 ha) orchard and 4.3 acres (1.7 ha) of vegetable and fruit gardens were created in addition to pastures and crop land, each with a distinct visual character. [...] The family always called their place “the farm,” but when he bought the land, Church took about half out of active agricultural production to create a landscaped park. [...] In this park, Church planted thousands of native trees (many transplanted from elsewhere on site); created a [...] lake from a swamp; built a freestanding studio, summer house, and rustic benches and railings; and designed five miles (8.05km) of carriage drives paved in <b>crushed</b> <b>red</b> shale mined on site. [...] Church strategically acquired additional adjacent parcels until his property encompassed 250.2 acres (101.3 ha) {{and the top of}} the hill where the main house at Olana now stands.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Burger King {{introduced}} a commercial in Russia, {{in which a}} Whopper was shown <b>crushing</b> <b>red</b> poppies, and the dialogue [...] "This is a poppy. It was popular once, but now its time has passed." [...] The Russian word for poppy is [...] "mak" [...] (мак), a homophone for Maca major nickname for McDonald's in Russia. [...] However, major Russian broadcasters rejected the ad due to concerns over its possible insinuation that the Whopper was better than drugs, as red poppies {{are in the same}} plant family as the source of heroin. The company refused to comment of the veracity of the networks' claims, and instead posted the advertisement on its YouTube channel, eventually pulling it from that service as well.|$|R
5|$|The 2013 season saw {{a nearly}} {{identical}} season to 2012. The Crusaders {{made the playoffs}} {{with a record of}} 11 wins and 5 losses.

50|$|Various {{substances}} {{have been}} used as rouge. In ancient Greece for example, crushed mulberries were favoured, while <b>red</b> beet juice, <b>crushed</b> strawberries and <b>red</b> amaranth have also variously been used.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} use {{is in the}} form of crushed flakes, which are {{typically}} slightly milder and more oily than conventional <b>crushed</b> <b>red</b> pepper, with a hint of saltiness and a slightly raisin-like flavor. Unlike <b>crushed</b> <b>red</b> pepper, the flakes contain no inner flesh and seeds, contributing to the mildness. Crushed Aleppo pepper can be used as a substitute for <b>crushed</b> <b>red</b> pepper or paprika.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crushed</b> <b>red</b> pepper shakers {{have become}} as {{standard}} as {{salt and pepper}} on tables at Italian style restaurants and especially pizza parlors in the United States. Often {{there is a high}} ratio of seeds, which some people believe intensifies the heat of this flavorful condiment. <b>Crushed</b> <b>red</b> pepper is used by food manufacturers in pickling blends, chowders, spaghetti sauce, pizza sauce, soups and sausage.|$|E
5000|$|The {{village is}} famous for its <b>crushed</b> <b>red</b> pepper or chilli flakes which it is {{credited}} with inventing. [...] The local variety ofchili pepper is known as [...] "буковец" [...] (bukovec).

5000|$|In 1966 Kwan-Gett {{went to the}} Cleveland Clinic to do {{artificial}} heart research as a fellow with Dr. Yuki Nose. In 1967 Kwan-Gett moved to Salt Lake City, Utah with Dr. Willem J. Kolff {{to establish a new}} Division of Artificial Organs at the University of Utah. During his tenure as director of engineering and the sole surgeon with the {{artificial heart}} program at the University of Utah from 1967 to 1971, Kwan-Gett invented a pneumatically powered total artificial heart system. An important advance of this system was the ability to mimic [...] "Starling's Law," [...] which describes the natural heart's ability to vary the blood volume of each beat depending on the pressures in the upper chambers of the heart. Kwan-Gett's system was the first to use completely passive filling of the artificial heart's ventricles in a way that automatically balanced blood flow between the left and right ventricles without using complex control systems. [...] Another innovation of the Kwan-Gett heart was the use of hemispherical non-distensible pumping diaphragms that did not <b>crush</b> <b>red</b> blood cells against the walls of the heart.|$|R
50|$|A popular {{traditional}} dish is {{chicken or}} turkey with sauce, seasoned with <b>crushed</b> garlic and <b>red</b> pepper. Mutton and beef are served boiled, usually with a seasoning of sour milk with crushed garlic and salt.|$|R

Bob reminds them that the black team <b>crushed</b> the <b>red</b> team at the weigh in - the black team is not weak. Despite not having access to the gym, the black team has a strong workout.|$|R
50|$|Prostanthera calycina, the West Coast Mintbush or Limestone Mintbush, is a {{spreading}} perennial shrub {{that grows}} to 0.5 m tall. It is endemic to Eyre Peninsula in South Australia. The species has dark green leaves, which smell of mint when <b>crushed.</b> Its <b>red,</b> tube-shaped flowers are about 2 cm long, with petals opening out. A maroon (or sometimes green) outer envelope (calyx) encloses each flower. The West Coast Mintbush is listed nationally under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act as vulnerable to extinction.|$|R
5000|$|Chili flakes {{are known}} by the name [...] "Bukovo" [...] (named after the town of Bukovo from where they originate) This {{is the most common}} name for <b>crushed</b> <b>red</b> chili in the Republic of Macedonia and {{throughout}} the Balkans.|$|E

50|$|Aachen Cathedral was {{plastered}} red in {{the time}} of Charlemagne, {{according to the most recent}} findings of the Rheinish Office for Monuments. This plaster was made longer-lasting through the addition of <b>crushed</b> <b>red</b> brick. The colour was probably also a reference to the imperial associations of the work.|$|E
50|$|Lomi is best eaten while {{steaming}} hot. It is {{a challenge}} to be able to finish eating before the bowl gets cold. To spice up the taste, depending on one's preference, a mixture of soy sauce, kalamansi juice and <b>crushed</b> fresh <b>red</b> chili peppers can be added to the dish as a condiment. The same soy sauce mixture can also be used as a dipping sauce for the meatballs, Other lomi patrons request a small amount of finely chopped fresh red onions to be eaten with the dish for extra pungency.|$|R
50|$|The first {{clinical}} {{use of an}} artificial heart designed for permanent implantation rather than a bridge to transplant occurred in 1982 at the University of Utah. Artificial kidney pioneer Willem Johan Kolff started the Utah artificial organs program in 1967. There, physician-engineer Clifford Kwan-Gett invented two components of an integrated pneumatic artificial heart system: a ventricle with hemispherical diaphragms that did not <b>crush</b> <b>red</b> blood cells (a problem with previous artificial hearts) and an external heart driver that inherently regulated blood flow without needing complex control systems. Independently, Paul Winchell designed and patented a similarly shaped ventricle and donated the patent to the Utah program. Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, veterinarian Donald Olsen led a series of calf experiments that refined the artificial heart and its surgical care. During that time, {{as a student at}} the University of Utah, Robert Jarvik combined several modifications: an ovoid shape to fit inside the human chest, a more blood-compatible polyurethane developed by biomedical engineer Donald Lyman, and a fabrication method by Kwan-Gett that made the inside of the ventricles smooth and seamless to reduce dangerous stroke-causing blood clots. On December 2, 1982, William DeVries implanted the artificial heart into retired dentist Barney Bailey Clark (born January 21, 1921), who survived 112 days with the device, dying on March 23, 1983. Bill Schroeder became the second recipient and lived for a record 620 days.|$|R
