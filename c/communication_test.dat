50|$|Integrated {{discrete}} Multiple Organ Culture (IdMOC) is an in vitro, {{cell culture}} based experimental {{model for the}} study of intercellular communication. In conventional in vitro systems, each cell type is studied in isolation ignoring critical interactions between organs or cell types. IdMOC technology is based on the concept that multiple organs signal or communicate via the systemic circulation (i.e., blood).The IdMOC plate consists of multiple inner wells within a large interconnecting chamber. Multiple cell types are first individually seeded in the inner wells and, when required, are flooded with an overlying medium to facilitate well-to-well <b>communication.</b> <b>Test</b> material can be added to the overlying medium and both media and cells can be analyzed individually. Plating of hepatocytes with other organ-specific cells allows evaluation of drug metabolism and organotoxicity.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of oral {{communication}} strategy instruction on English as a Second Language (ESL) learners’ oral communicative performance and their strategic competence. The treatment involved 12 weeks of training using oral communication strategies such as circumlocution, appeal for help, clarification request, fillers, comprehension check, confirmation checks, self-repair and topic avoidance. Strategies were integrated into the learners’ Communicative English 2 Course syllabus with Mechanical Engineering content. The study involved two intact control (n= 34) and experimental groups (n= 54). The control group only received the normal Communicative English course with no explicit focus on communication strategies (CS) while the experimental group received CS training designed with metacognitive strategies. Pre and posttest procedures {{were used to assess}} the effectiveness of the training and learners’ strategic competence. Five instruments were used to collect the data (oral proficiency test, oral <b>communication</b> <b>test,</b> transcripts of oral <b>communication</b> <b>test,</b> unstructured interview and self-report). The findings revealed that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group after the training and the learners’ self-reports also revealed positive results.
