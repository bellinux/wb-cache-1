40|$|AbstractObjective The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the <b>cost</b> {{effectiveness}} <b>of</b> silicone and alginate impressions for complete dentures. Methods Cost effectiveness analyses were undertaken alongside a UK single centre, double blind, controlled, crossover clinical trial. Taking the perspective of the healthcare sector, effectiveness is measured using the EuroQol (EQ- 5 D- 3 L) which provides a single index value for health status that may be combined with time to produce quality adjusted life years (QALYs); and Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-EDENT). Incremental cost effectiveness ratios are presented representing the additional cost per one unit gained. Results Mean cost was higher in the silicone impression group (£ 388. 57 vs. £ 363. 18). Negligible between-group differences were observed in QALY gains; the silicone group had greater mean OHIP-EDENT gains. The additional cost using silicone was £ 3. 41 per change of one point in the OHIP-EDENT. Conclusions The silicone group was more costly, driven by the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> materials. Changes in the EQ- 5 D and QALY gains over time and between arms were not statistically significant. Change in OHIP-EDENT score showed greater improvement in the silicone group and the difference between arms was statistically significant. Given negligible QALY gains and low level of resource use, results must be treated with caution. It is difficult to make robust claims about the comparative cost-effectiveness. Clinical significance Silicone impressions for complete dentures improve patients’ quality of life (OHIP-EDENT score). The extra <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> silicone <b>impressions</b> is £ 30 per patient. Dentists, patients and health care funders need to consider the clinical and financial value <b>of</b> silicone <b>impressions.</b> Different patients, different dentists, different health funders will have individual perceptions and judgements.

40|$|Reach curves {{arise in}} {{advertising}} and media analysis {{as they relate}} the number <b>of</b> content <b>impressions</b> {{to the number of}} people who have seen it. This is es-pecially important for measuring the effectiveness of an ad on TV or websites (Nielsen, 2009; Pricewater-houseCoopers, 2010). For a mathematical and data-driven analysis, it would be very useful to know the entire reach curve; advertisers, however, often only know its last data point, i. e., the total number of im-pressions and the total reach. In this work I present a new method to estimate the entire curve using only this last data point. Furthermore, analytic derivations reveal a surpris-ingly simple, yet insightful relationship between marginal cost per reach, average cost per impression, and frequency. Thus, advertisers can estimate the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> an additional reach point by just knowing their total number <b>of</b> <b>impressions,</b> reach, and <b>cost.</b> A comparison <b>of</b> the proposed one-data point method to two competing regression models on TV reach curve data, shows that the proposed methodology performs only slightly poorer than regression fits to a collection of several points along the curve. ...|$|R
