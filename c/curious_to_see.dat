5|$|The Elephant Man exhibit was {{moderately}} successful, {{and made}} money {{primarily from the}} sales of the autobiographical pamphlet. Merrick {{was able to put}} his share of the profits aside, hoping to earn enough to one day buy a home of his own. The shop on Whitechapel Road was directly across the road from the London Hospital, an excellent location, as medical students and doctors visited the shop, <b>curious</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Merrick. One visitor was a young house surgeon named Reginald Tuckett. Like his colleagues, Tuckett was intrigued by the Elephant Man's deformities and told his senior colleague Frederick Treves.|$|E

Although several of them are native bushmen, and all are as black as night, these Indian fellows are to all intents and purposes, clothed and in their right minds.|$|E
25|$|The {{crew was}} tightly bound with ropes whilst the Diana, now under control of Petr Rikord, {{shot at the}} castle but was then forced to set sail to avoid capture. The captives were sailed across the straits to Hokkaido and {{encountered}} many villagers who were <b>curious</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Russians, due to the almost complete absence of foreigners in Japan. A Japanese drawing of their captivity shows the Russians' tall stature compared to the Japanese, which is also confirmed by Golovnin. The crew was led to a prison in Hakodate, the capital of Hokkaido.|$|E

25|$|When {{the first}} {{prisoners of war}} were captured, the German Army’s superiority was put on display by making them march through towns, which {{produced}} scenes of collective hate. In certain train stations, mannequins dressed in Allied uniforms were hung, visible to prisoners passing by in trains: “I noticed that in many stations, the Krauts hung mannequins depicting sometimes a zouave, other times a grunt or an artilleryman”. Camp visits were organised for schoolchildren. “Sunday, schoolchildren ordered about by their teachers with drums, fifes and flags toured the camp. We had to tour the cinemas and the…menageries surrounding the city, for the public would not stop flooding in. They were especially <b>curious</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the troops from Africa”.|$|E
500|$|In 1985, {{professional}} expedition leader Mike Dunn {{organized a}} trip to take the then [...] "greatest explorers" [...] to the North Pole. The group included Armstrong, Edmund Hillary, Hillary's son Peter, Steve Fossett, and Patrick Morrow, and arrived on April 6, 1985. Armstrong said he was <b>curious</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what the North Pole looked like from ground level, as he'd only seen it from the Moon.|$|E
500|$|The {{museum is}} the subject of The Final Member, a film by Canadian documentarians Zach Math and Jonah Bekhor. It {{profiles}} Sigurður and his quest to obtain a human penis for the museum, telling the story of the American and Icelandic donors and examining the quasi-taboo nature of the museum's collection. Bekhor says: [...] "I wouldn't say it's a Rorschach test, but depending on how you react to it really says a lot about what your relationship is with that element of the human anatomy. It's a really interesting phenomenon and we're really <b>curious</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how audiences respond." [...] The film premiered on 1 May 2012 at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival.|$|E

500|$|It Takes a Church has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Tom Conroy of Media Life enjoyed the premiere episode, {{arguing that it}} may even attract a secular audience: [...] "Even secular viewers will be <b>curious</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> which one Angela picks, and they’ll get a glimpse into a subculture that is largely invisible on TV. Members of that subculture, on the other hand, will watch It Takes a Church and say, 'Amen!'". Contrastly, Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times called the series [...] "utterly frivolous," [...] and called into question the [...] "state of America's spiritual health" [...] after watching an episode. Genzlinger also argued that the show was a {{not much more than}} a [...] "desperate" [...] effort to find something the conservative Christian audience will watch. Carrie Grosvenor of About Entertainment added that viewers should [...] "pass" [...] on the series, calling GSN's The American Bible Challenge a better [...] "solid game format." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{subsequently}} found {{local support}} in Germany. Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck saw that Cruise's involvement would promote awareness of a neglected story, and veteran German actor Armin Mueller-Stahl also gave his {{support to the}} production. A grandson of Colonel von Stauffenberg, who appeared in the film as an assistant, hailed Cruise's professionalism and indicated {{that most of his}} family were <b>curious</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the finished product. In September 2007, when the Defence Ministry initially denied permission for filming at the Bendlerblock memorial, support for the film came in from German newspaper columnists and filmmakers, including director Wolfgang Petersen and Frank Schirrmacher, journalist and co-publisher of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Schirrmacher visited the set and agreed that the film would advance global awareness of the German Resistance. Ultimately granting access to the Bendlerblock after reviewing the script, the Defence Ministry said it showed that [...] "barbarism didn't triumph but led to the founding of a democratic Germany". Ursula Caberta, {{who is in charge of}} a German government office which monitors Scientology, was disappointed in the ministry's decision, saying, [...] "Tom Cruise [...] a figurehead of an anti-constitutional organization, and he should be treated that way." ...|$|E
500|$|When Ehrich first {{stepped into}} the role, he stated: [...] "There [...] so many places where they can go with this role. I have just gotten back into Genoa City. It’s such a {{vulnerable}} age, so really there [...] so many different paths I can go down. And there’s so much that can happen. I’m very, very <b>curious</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> where they go with it." [...] When asked how he would describe Fenmore, Ehrich said: [...] "He is definitely figuring himself out. You’re {{on the brink of}} adulthood. You have to start taking a bit of responsibility. [...] your hormones start kicking in hardcore. So he’s definitely going through some stuff." [...] In another interview, he described Fenmore as [...] "trying to find his place in the world", saying: [...] "When Fen first came back, I think he was at a very vulnerable age and was trying to find his place in the world; just really figure out who he is. He has such a strict dad, who just became D.A., so of course his morals are so strong and everything is black and white, right or wrong." [...] Luke Kerr of Zap2it wrote that the character had become [...] "creepy" [...] during his angst and acting out.|$|E
60|$|I {{was then}} <b>curious,</b> indeed, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it; and when I came <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it, {{it was nothing}} but this: it was a timber house, or a house built, as we call it in England, with lath and plaster, but all the {{plastering}} was really China ware, that is to say, it was plastered with the earth that makes China ware.|$|R
6000|$|She {{moved slowly}} away, her steps still {{unsteady}} and her cheeks colourless, but the sweet light of thankfulness on her face; while Bertha said, in her moralizing tone, 'It is a <b>curious</b> study <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Phoebe taking her own steady nerves {{and power of}} resource for something external to herself, and being pious about it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{a moment}} Christie forgot every thing else, and waited with a <b>curious</b> anxiety <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what manner of man this was. Presently {{he got up}} with an open book in his hand, saying, in a strong, cheerful voice: [...] "Let us sing," [...] and having read a hymn {{as if he had}} {{composed}} it, he sat down again.|$|R
500|$|Inspired by his {{enjoyment}} {{of his own}} botanical garden but primarily by Anna Seward's poem “Verses Written in Dr. Darwin's Botanic Garden” (1778), Darwin decided to compose a poem that would embody Linnaeus's ideas. (Darwin would later include an edited version of Seward's poem in The Loves of the Plants without her permission and without acknowledgement. Seward was rankled by this treatment and complained of Darwin's inattention to her authorial rights in her Memoirs of Erasmus Darwin.) According to Seward, Darwin said that “the Linnean System is unexplored poetic ground, and an [...] happy subject for the muse. It affords fine scope for poetic landscape; it suggests metamorphoses of the Ovidian kind, though reversed.” Darwin may have also thought of The Love of the Plants “as a kind of love song” to Elizabeth Pole, a woman with whom {{he was in love}} and would eventually marry. Concerned about his scientific reputation and <b>curious</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if there would be an audience for his more demanding poem The Economy of Vegetation, he published The Loves of the Plants anonymously in 1789 (see 1789 in poetry). He was stunned at its success and therefore published both Loves of the Plants and Economy of Vegetation together as The Botanic Garden in 1791. Joseph Johnson, his publisher, eventually bought the copyright for The Botanic Garden from him for the staggering sum of ₤800.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} highly positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger called [...] "Broke" [...] a [...] "great, great" [...] episode, {{although he}} said he wished the Michael Scott Paper Company arc could have lasted longer. Sepinwall praised touches such as the Korean women who were constantly getting into the sales van, and Michael's moment of nervousness on the elevator, and said the ending when Michael came through was particularly satisfying. Will Leitch of New York magazine described [...] "Broke" [...] as [...] "a rousing, exuberant episode that continues one of The Offices best runs in history". Leitch said the negotiations during {{the latter half of}} the episode had genuine tension, and that all the storylines of the Michael Scott Paper Company arc were wrapped up perfectly. Travis Fickett of IGN said the episode was strong enough that it could have served as the season finale. He said the episode had lots of good throw-away moments, like Charles brown-nosing to David and realizing Dwight is eccentric, as well as several clever twists, like Jim's actions in tricking Dwight and helping the Michael Scott Paper Company get bought out. Eric Rezsnyak of the City Newspaper said the episode was a strong finale to the Michael Scott Paper Company arc, which was [...] "probably the best thing to happen to the show in the last two seasons". Rezsnyak praised Michael's impressive actions in the episode and said he was <b>curious</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how Michael's relationship with several of the supporting characters would be recast as a result of this episode.|$|E
500|$|Issue #1 {{received}} an average score of 7.3/10 based on 26 reviews from critics on Comic Book Roundup. Greg McElhatton of CBR gave it four stars writing, [...] "Overall, Civil War II #1 {{is a good}} launching point for this miniseries, even as it integrates the information from Civil War II #0 and the Free Comic Book Day special. I'm <b>curious</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if Bendis and Marquez can maintain this level of tension and what they'll add into the mix to keep the conflict burning strong. For now, though, it's {{more than enough to}} get readers coming back for more." [...] Schedeen gave it a 7.1 saying, [...] "This first issue cleanly establishes the conflict and delivers a nonstop stream of gorgeous artwork. However, it offers few surprises for those not already familiar with the basics of this crossover, and it often fails to elicit a strong emotional response in the way the first issue of Civil War did ten years ago." [...] Richard Gray of Newsarama gave it a 7 and said, [...] "At this early stage, Civil War II suffers {{some of the problems that}} have beleaguered similar narratives in recent years, principally in seeing heroes all too quick to take sides against comrades on a possible future. Yet this is also just the beginning of something much larger, and while it may seem at times like this is an extended version of the 'zero' issue that preceded it, all the pieces are now in place for the 'war' proper to commence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There were a {{great many}} <b>curious</b> things <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in the church," [...] {{continued}} Rollo.

500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review for the episode, [...] ""No One" [...] may have given us a bloodless siege, but {{there were plenty of}} bloody moments, namely from the {{brothers}} Clegane, who were both awesomely brutal this week. Though not against one another, as it looks like, for now, the Cleganebowl's been canceled. I loved the end of Arya's arc along with Jaime's scheme to take Riverrun - though I'm <b>curious</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what comes of the Tully angle. Brienne failed to get an army for Sansa and Jaime's just going to head back home now? It seems like there should be more to this that him just winning one for the Lannister name. Though regardless of what the payoff might be, it was still good to see how so much of this story tied back to the first three seasons and Jaime's time as Catelyn's prisoner." [...] He gave the episode an 8.2 out of 10. Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club criticized the episode's momentum within the season, writing [...] "The lack of momentum driving these stories is surprising to me given that the season has largely been doing a fine job with internal momentum." [...] McNutt continued, [...] "The show may have run into an unfortunate convergence of so many anti-climactic storylines in a single episode, but their very existence is a necessary byproduct of a narrative that is preparing to shed its skin and move forward with a new lease on life." [...] Despite this, he gave the episode a grade of B-. Erik Kain of Forbes wrote about the episode, [...] "Not the greatest episode of the season, but I still didn't want it to end. Sometimes I realize that even an episode I have lots of complaints about manages to be some of the best television out there. Game of Thrones isn't always on the money, but even an off night can be surprisingly good." [...] James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly summarized the episode in his review by saying [...] "Cheers, chills, and the sound of online fan theories imploding. [...] "No One" [...] delivered Jaime Lannister's finest scene in years, a thrilling chase, and set one Stark on an exciting new path." ...|$|E

2500|$|Alan Sepinwall of HitFix {{said of the}} episode: [...] "...there {{were some}} discussion-worthy things in [...] "Prisoner of War," [...] and I'm also <b>curious</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> ongoing {{reaction}} to the show..." [...] He stated that he enjoyed the scene where the Skitter attacks Tom, stating, [...] "Noah Wyle takes out a skitter singlehanded! Tom dragging the creature through the school was a nice moment (if, {{like most of the}} series, borrowed from another alien invasion story, in this case Will Smith in the desert in [...] "Independence Day"), and I remain impressed by the effects work on the creature itself.|$|E

Cyril, <b>curious</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> why the edict caused such an uproar, sent Hierax, a [...] "Christian possessing understanding and intelligence", who, although opposed to paganism, did as Cyril asked and went to learn the nature of Orestes's edict. Meanwhile, the Jews who gathered in anger over the edict believed that Hierax had come only for the sake of provocation (which, according to Socrates’ text, was Hierax's intent). Upon this assumption, Orestes had Hierax punished for a crime for which [...] "he was wholly guiltless".|$|E
2500|$|In February 2011, {{the museum}} denied a {{same-sex}} couple entry to its after hours [...] "Date Night" [...] {{and refused to}} reimburse {{the cost of their}} tickets (about [...] ), stating it was clear from the advertisements that the event was about Christian marriage, which is {{between a man and a}} woman, and that one of the men had made a statement in a blog post a month earlier that gave the museum the impression that the couple was planning to be disruptive. The blog requested donations to send a [...] "flamboyantly gay" [...] couple to the event. Later one of the men admitted he wasn't gay and said that he was <b>curious</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if the museum would let them in.|$|E
