5|$|Segments {{are further}} divided into work areas, {{indicated}} by brackets {{in the list}} above. Work {{is scheduled to begin}} in Segments 2 and 4 and proceed from north to south within each segment before moving on to Segments 1 and 3. The first work area will be in the cities of South San Francisco and San Bruno. Within each work area, the first activity will be tree pruning and removal (scheduled duration, two months) followed by construction of the foundations for the overhead <b>contact</b> <b>system</b> poles (scheduled duration, three to five months). Once the foundations are complete, construction of the traction power substation (estimated at twelve months in duration) and pole and wire installation (estimated at three months) will work in parallel. Schedules have been announced for Segment 2, Work Areas 5 (South City/San Bruno), 4 (Millbrae/Burlingame), and 3 (San Mateo). Traction power substations have been confirmed for South San Francisco and Burlingame, with another traction power substation in the city of San Mateo at a site yet to be named.|$|E

500|$|Practical - Full <b>contact</b> <b>system</b> {{where the}} core of the combat is {{completely}} dependent on what your character can do, not what your character has the stats to do. These types of LARPs exist with boffer weapons, but they are more commonly seen with real weapons and armor. This system follows variations of the Limb Loss System with the primary difference being realism. In some practical LARPs actions such as kicking another player's shield is authorize, as seen in the LARP Dagohir. Practical systems that involve real weapons and armor put emphasis on realism, specifically historic realism which is what the [...] strives to achieve. The SCA is techinally an educational group and not a LARP, however, they are the most widely known group that utilizes the Practical system of combat. On the RP side of things, Practical LARPs differ from Limb Loss LARPs because of the interaction that takes place between combat. Generally, but not always, Practical LARPs do not role play in between fights and if they do, they usually take on the role of a historical figure rather than a created character.|$|E

Ozonation system performance in many potable and industrial applications can be compromised by changes in raw water quality or by poorly designed ozone <b>contacting</b> <b>systems.</b> Increased ozone demand can stretch system operation beyond the original design capabilities while low mass transfer efficiency will reduce system performance even under design demand conditions.
