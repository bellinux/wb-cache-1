5|$|Perfect Dark is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} by Rare and released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in 2000. It {{is the first}} title of the Perfect Dark video game series and follows the story of Carrington Institute agent Joanna Dark as she attempts to stop an extraterrestrial conspiracy by rival corporation dataDyne. A different game set in the same fictional universe, also titled Perfect Dark, was released for the Game Boy Color shortly afterwards. Both Perfect Dark and its Game Boy Color counterpart feature a <b>compatibility</b> <b>mode</b> that allows certain gameplay options within the game to alternatively be unlocked via a Transfer Pak.|$|E
5|$|Perfect Dark {{was first}} {{released}} in North America on 22 May 2000 and in Europe on 30 June 2000. A separate Game Boy Color game {{set in the}} same fictional universe, also titled Perfect Dark, was released shortly afterwards {{as a supplement to}} the game. It features a <b>compatibility</b> <b>mode</b> that allows certain cheats within the Nintendo 64 game to alternatively be unlocked via the Transfer Pak. Unlike GoldenEye 007, Perfect Dark received an M (Mature) rating from the ESRB due to its graphic content and adult language. This caused some controversy, as Nintendo has a reputation for family-friendly games like Mario and Pokémon. Total sales for the game reached 1.3 million copies in the United States. Finally, the game was released in Japan on 21 October. The Japanese launch was a success, with the sale of 35,000 copies in the first week, and 77,000 in total. Worldwide, Perfect Dark sold 3.2 million copies according to game designer Chris Tilston. As a result, a Player's Choice edition was released in 2001.|$|E

25|$|The 68000 {{grew out}} of the MACSS (Motorola Advanced Computer System on Silicon) project, begun in 1976 to develop an entirely new {{architecture}} without backward compatibility. It would be a higher-power sibling complementing the existing 8-bit 6800 line rather than a compatible successor. In the end, the 68000 did retain a bus protocol <b>compatibility</b> <b>mode</b> for existing 6800 peripheral devices, and a version with an 8-bit data bus was produced. However, the designers mainly focused on the future, or forward compatibility, which gave the 68000 design a head start against later 32-bit instruction set architectures. For instance, the CPU registers are 32bits wide, though few self-contained structures in the processor itself operate on 32bits at a time. The MACSS team drew heavily on the influence of minicomputer processor design, such as the PDP-11 and VAX systems, which were similarly microcode-based.|$|E

25|$|The ARM2 {{featured}} a 32-bit data bus, 26-bit address space and 2732-bit registers. Eightbits {{from the program}} counter register were available for other purposes; the top sixbits (available because of the 26-bit address space) served as status flags, and the bottom twobits (available because the program counter was always word-aligned) were used for setting modes. The address bus was extended to 32bits in the ARM6, but program code still had to lie within the first 64MB of memory in 26-bit <b>compatibility</b> <b>mode,</b> due to the reserved bits for the status flags. The ARM2 had a transistor count of just 30,000, compared to Motorola's six-year-older 68000 model with around 40,000. Much of this simplicity came {{from the lack of}} microcode (which represents about one-quarter to one-third of the 68000) and from (like most CPUs of the day) not including any cache. This simplicity enabled low power consumption, yet better performance than the Intel 80286. A successor, ARM3, was produced with a 4KB cache, which further improved performance.|$|E

The Trident/4.0 token was likewise changed to Trident/5.0.

2500|$|Version 4 {{released}} in September 1997, was shipped with Windows 95 OSR (OEM Service Release) 2.5, {{and the latest}} beta version of Windows 98 and was modified to integrate more closely with Microsoft Windows. It included an option to enable [...] "Active Desktop" [...] which displayed World Wide Web content on the desktop itself and was updated automatically as the content changed. The user could select other pages for use as Active Desktops as well. [...] "Active Channel" [...] technology was also introduced to automatically obtain information updates from websites.

This version was designed to work on Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT, and could be downloaded from the Internet, free of charge. It supported Dynamic HTML (DHTML). Outlook Express 4.0 also came integrated into the browser and replaced the aging Microsoft Internet Mail & News product that was released with previous versions. Version 5 came out in March 1999, following Microsoft's release of Internet Explorer 5.0 Beta versions in late 1998 [...] Bi-directional text, ruby text and direct XML/XSLT support were included in this release, along with enhanced support for CSS Level 1 and 2. The actual release of Internet Explorer 5 happened in three stages. Firstly, a Developer Preview was {{released in}} June 1998 (5.0B1), and then a Public Preview was released in November 1998 (5.0B2). Then in March 1999 the final release was released (5.0). In September it was released with Windows 98. Version 5.0 was the last one to be released for Windows 3.1x or Windows NT 3.x. Internet Explorer 5.5 was later released for Windows Me in July 2000, and included many bug fixes and security patches. Version 5.5 was the last to have <b>Compatibility</b> <b>Mode,</b> which allowed Internet Explorer 4 to be run {{side by side with the}} 5.x. With IE6, there was a quirks mode that could be triggered to make it behave like IE5.5 Version 6 was released with Windows XP on August 27, 2001. It mainly focused on privacy and security features, as they had become customer priorities. Microsoft implemented tools that support P3P, a technology under development by the W3C.|$|E
