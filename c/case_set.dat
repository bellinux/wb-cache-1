It {{is known that}} for linear problems adaptive information of fixed cardinality does not help in the worst <b>case</b> <b>setting.</b> It does not help also in the average <b>case</b> <b>setting</b> with Gaussian measures. We prove that in the worst <b>case</b> <b>setting</b> a similar result holds for information of varying cardinality. In the average <b>case</b> <b>setting</b> with Gaussian measures, information of varying cardinality can be more powerful than information of fixed cardinality. However, optimal information has a structure which is almost as simple as nonadaptive information of fixed cardinality. We also give a condition under which varying cardinality does not help. These results are useful for deriving tight bounds on complexity, which is also studied in this paper...|$|R

5|$|As with so {{many other}} parts of the myth, the {{resolution}} is complex and varied. Often, Horus and Set divide the realm between them. This division can be equated with any of several fundamental dualities that the Egyptians saw in their world. Horus may receive the fertile lands around the Nile, the core of Egyptian civilization, in which <b>case</b> <b>Set</b> takes the barren desert or the foreign lands that are associated with it; Horus may rule the earth while Set dwells in the sky; and each god may take one of the two traditional halves of the country, Upper and Lower Egypt, in which case either god may be connected with either region. Yet in the Memphite Theology, Geb, as judge, first apportions the realm between the claimants and then reverses himself, awarding sole control to Horus. In this peaceable union, Horus and Set are reconciled, and the dualities that they represent have been resolved into a united whole. Through this resolution, order is restored after the tumultuous conflict.|$|E
5|$|Lincolnshire's {{government}} initially {{adhered to}} a conservative and cautious approach, {{and refused to}} annex two corporate park divisions in the 1980s. Opponents to the village government's methods, however, won out in later years; supporting a quick growth to rival the increasing affluence of surrounding villages, they oversaw the cessions of the Marriott Lincolnshire Resort and Lincolnshire Corporate Center {{over a period of}} years following 1983. Lincolnshire also sought to annex the old remnants of the unincorporated community of Half Day from which it was created, but lost in a court battle with the village of Vernon Hills in 1994; the court <b>case</b> <b>set</b> the present-day border between the two villages, which lies along Route 22 up to its intersection with Milwaukee Avenue. To consolidate these new acquisitions, Lincolnshire set to work on a new village hall that was completed in 1993, and constructed a downtown area centered on the intersection of Aptakisic Road and Milwaukee Avenue; the village's endeavors included commercial regions like the Lincolnshire Corporate Center, City Park, and the Lincolnshire Commons. These facilities were planned and constructed from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{problem is}} said to be ill-posed if the {{solution}} of the problem does not depend continuously on the input data. In this survey paper, we consider two different information-based settings for the optimal computation of approximate solution of ill-posed linear problems, namely the worst case and average case settings. These settings are studied for two different error criteria, namely, the absolute error and the residual error criteria. The main result for the absolute-error criterion is that algorithms having finite error exist for a given setting if and only if the solution operator is bounded in that setting. In the worst <b>case</b> <b>setting</b> with an absolute error criterion, this means that there is no algorithm for solving ill-posed problems having finite error. In the average <b>case</b> <b>setting</b> with an absolute error criterion, this means that algorithms having finite error exist if and only if the solution operator is “bounded on the average. ” Furthermore, when this holds, we exhibit optimal information of cardinality n, finding that the nth minimal average error goes to zero as n → ∞. The main result for the residual error criterion is that the problem may be formally reduced to the approximation problem. Hence, finite-error algorithms always exist. We exhibit optimal information of cardinality n. In the worst <b>case</b> <b>setting,</b> we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the nth minimal error to go to zero as n → ∞; in the average <b>case</b> <b>setting,</b> this always occurs. We use these results to determine the ε-complexity of ill-posed problems. The ε-complexity is infinite for any ε > 0 in the worst <b>case</b> <b>setting</b> with the absolute criterion. However, in the average <b>case</b> <b>setting</b> with either error criterion and the worst <b>case</b> <b>setting</b> with the residual error criterion, we determine necessary and sufficient conditions for the ε-complexity to be finite for all ε > 0; moreover, we find algorithms yielding ε-approximations with almost-minimal cost...|$|R

Ipswich, Norwich, Exeter and Oxford united to campaign for unitary authority status for the four towns, hoping to use the window of opportunity presented by the October 2006 Local Government White Paper. In March 2007, it was announced that Ipswich was one of 16 shortlisted councils and on 25 July 2007, the secretary of state announced that she was minded to implement the unitary proposal for Ipswich, but that there were 'a number of risks relating to the financial <b>case</b> <b>set</b> out in the proposal', on which she invited Ipswich to undertake further work before a final decision was taken. Early in December plans were thrown into doubt as the government announced that it had 'delayed' the unitary bids for Ipswich and Exeter.

In previous work, we have obtained tight complexity bounds for this problem in the worst <b>case</b> <b>setting,</b> and found conditions that are necessary and sufficient for the finite element method (FEM) to be an almost optimal complexity algorithm. Since these bounds show that elliptic PDE are intractable in the worst <b>case</b> <b>setting,</b> it is natural to seek another setting in which PDE are tractable. With this in mind, we look at the average <b>case</b> <b>setting.</b> For a large class of measures (which includes Wiener measure as a special case), we give tight bounds on the average case complexity of PDE. Moreover, we show that the FEM with properly chosen parameters is an almost optimal complexity algorithm in the average case...|$|R
