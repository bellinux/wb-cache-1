2500|$|Consider chromophores {{surrounded}} by solvent molecules. These surrounding molecules may {{interact with the}} chromophores, particularly if the solvent molecules are polar. This association between solvent and solute {{is referred to as}} solvation and is a stabilizing interaction, that is, the solvent molecules can move and rotate until the energy of the interaction is minimized. The interaction itself involves electrostatic and van der Waals forces and can also include hydrogen bonds. Franck–Condon principles can be applied when the interactions between the chromophore and the surrounding solvent molecules are different in the ground and in the excited electronic state. This change in interaction can originate, for example, due to different dipole moments in these two states. If the chromophore starts in its ground state and is close to equilibrium with the surrounding solvent molecules and then absorbs a photon that takes it to the excited state, its interaction with the solvent will be far from equilibrium in the excited state. This effect is analogous to the original Franck–Condon principle: the electronic transition is very fast compared with the motion of nuclei—the rearrangement of solvent molecules in the case of solvation. We now speak of a vertical transition, but now the horizontal coordinate is solvent-solute interaction space. This <b>coordinate</b> <b>axis</b> is often labeled as [...] "Solvation Coordinate" [...] and represents, somewhat abstractly, all of the relevant dimensions of motion of all of the interacting solvent molecules.|$|E

40|$|Embryonic {{development}} requires maternal {{proteins and}} RNA. In Caenorhabditis elegans, a gradient of CCCH tandem zinc finger (TZF) proteins <b>coordinates</b> <b>axis</b> polarization and germline differentiation. These proteins govern expression from maternal mRNAs {{by an unknown}} mechanism. Here we show that the TZF protein MEX- 5, a primary anterior determinant, is an RNA-binding protein that recognizes linear RNA sequences with high affinity but low specificity. The minimal binding site is a tract of six or more uridines within a 9 - 13 -nucleotide window. This sequence is remarkably abundant in the 32 ̆ 7 -untranslated region of C. elegans transcripts, demonstrating that MEX- 5 alone cannot specify mRNA target selection. In contrast, human TZF homologs tristetraprolin and ERF- 2 bind with high specificity to UUAUUUAUU elements. We show that mutation of a single amino acid in each MEX- 5 zinc finger confers tristetraprolin-like specificity to this protein. We propose that divergence of this discriminator residue modulates the RNA-binding specificity in this protein class. This residue is variable in nematode TZF proteins, but is invariant in other metazoans. Therefore, the divergence of TZF proteins and their critical role in early development is likely a nematode-specific adaptation...|$|R
