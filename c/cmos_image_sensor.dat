40|$|The role of <b>CMOS</b> <b>Image</b> <b>Sensors</b> {{since their}} birth around the 1960 s has been {{changing}} a lot. Unlike the past, current <b>CMOS</b> <b>Image</b> <b>Sensors</b> are becoming competitive {{with regard to}} Charged Couple Device (CCD) technology. They offer many advantages with respect to CCD, such as lower power consumption, lower voltage operation, on-chip functionality and lower cost. Nevertheless, they are still too noisy and less sensitive than CCDs. Noise and sensitivity are the key-factors to compete with industrial and scientific CCDs. It must be pointed out also that there are several kinds of <b>CMOS</b> <b>Image</b> <b>sensors,</b> each of them to satisfy the huge demand in different areas, such as Digital photography, industrial vision, medical and space applications, electrostatic sensing, automotive, instrumentation and 3 D vision systems.
