40|$|This {{research}} examines ethnic <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> Indonesia from 1998 to 2004 in {{an attempt}} to identify their underlying causes by using two case studies of ethnic conflict, one on Maluku Island and one in Poso, Central Sulawesi. The lessons learned that I drew from those two case studies address the questions, of why have ethnic <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> Indonesia taken place more frequently since 1998 and what the best strategies for the Indonesian government to use to prevent the eruption of ethnic <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> Indonesia in the future? With regard to the lessons learned from Maluku and Poso, this research generally concludes that underlying factors such as political disputes, economic and social disparities, religious and cultural differences, and tribal disputes have contributed to the current ethnic <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> Indonesia. Among the underlying factors, political disputes and economic and social disparities outweighed the other factors and played a more significant role in triggering the initial conflicts. This research contributes valuable information to the Indonesian government and nongovernmental organizations in dealing with future ethnic <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> Indonesia...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of {{different}} schooling dimensions (primary, secondary and tertiary) on the intensity of intra-state <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> 25 African states during the period 1989 - 2008. It uses fixed-effects and Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) estimators in an annualized panel data framework. Parameter estimates suggest the following (1) primary schooling broadly mitigates <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> Africa. However, in environments with high natural resource rents, it could ignite conflicts; (2) there is evidence, although not overwhelming, that secondary schooling potentially drives <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> Africa. There is also evidence that urbanization potentially drives <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> Africa. However, although secondary schooling and urbanization potentially drives <b>conflicts,</b> <b>in</b> environments where secondary schooling (urbanization) is high, urbanization (secondary schooling) mitigates conflicts; (3) {{there is no evidence}} of a strong direct positive impact of tertiary education on conflicts and conditioning on tertiary schooling, income inequality potentially drives <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> African states. However, in contexts where income inequality (tertiary schooling) is high, tertiary schooling (inequality) mitigates conflict. Two important policy implications follow from this study. First, in contexts where income inequality is high (for instance, in South Africa), governments should strive to foster tertiary education in order to reduce conflict. Second, where urbanization rates are high, they should foster both secondary and tertiary education. This study contributes to existing knowledge by clearly demonstrating the utility of distinguishing between different educational dimensions and the contexts wherein they matter for <b>conflict</b> mitigation <b>in</b> Africa...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{emergence}} of environmental resource conflict on the international political discourse in the early 1980 s, there has been growing concern that, resource <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> developing countries is likely to exacerbate <b>conflicts</b> originating <b>in</b> strenuous struggles over scarce resources due to population increase. The apparent manifestation of <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> the oil rich Niger Delta region in Southern Nigeria and Farmer-herder <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> Northern Nigeria to the lingering forest logging controversy in Malaysia is an upsurge of the coming resource “crisis” in these countries. The focus {{of this paper is}} to discuss issues on management of resource <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> developing countries like Nigeria and Malaysia. The paper suggests that, there is the need for commitment from the states and all stakeholders through institutionalization of proactive conflict resolution and peace building strategies, instead of resolution through the grave yards. Discussions are based on secondary data with examples from recent experiences from farmer-herder conflict, and Niger Delta crisis in Nigeria, and forest logging in Malaysia...|$|R
