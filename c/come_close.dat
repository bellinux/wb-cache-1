5|$|In 1999, New Age author V. M. Rabolu {{wrote in}} Hercolubus or Red Planet that Barnard's star is {{actually}} a planet known to the ancients as Hercolubus, which purportedly came dangerously close to Earth in the past, destroying Atlantis, and will <b>come</b> <b>close</b> to Earth again. Lieder subsequently used Rabolu's ideas to bolster her claims.|$|E

5|$|The 2000 Sydney Olympics saw Chambers <b>come</b> <b>close</b> to the podium. He easily {{qualified}} {{through the}} heat stages and achieved a season's best of 10.08s in the 100m final finishing fourth behind Greene, Ato Boldon and Obadele Thompson. Chambers {{was the best}} European 100m performer, but after disqualification in the relay he left the games without a medal.|$|E

5|$|The game marked Middle Tennessee's {{first ever}} win over an ACC opponent, {{although}} they had <b>come</b> <b>close</b> in Charlottesville the year prior, when Virginia made a go-ahead field goal with eightseconds remaining. It was Middle Tennessee's fourth win against an opponent from a Bowl Championship Series (BCS) conference. The other three all came against Vanderbilt.|$|E
5|$|Vegetative {{reproduction}} occurs {{naturally in}} some species that produce stolons or when roots <b>come</b> <b>close</b> {{to the surface}} of the soil. Older leaves that touch the ground may sprout plantlets. Pygmy sundews reproduce asexually using specialized scale-like leaves called gemmae. Tuberous sundews can produce offsets from their corms.|$|E
5|$|All tiger sharks {{generally}} swim slowly, which, {{combined with}} cryptic coloration, may make them difficult for prey to detect in some habitats. They are especially well camouflaged against dark backgrounds. Despite their sluggish appearance, tiger sharks {{are one of}} the strongest swimmers of the carcharhinid sharks. Once the shark has <b>come</b> <b>close,</b> a speed burst allows it to reach the intended prey before it can escape.|$|E

On predicting all four parties' vote shares, ANAR's poll had the least margins of error while KamuAR had the most.|$|R
5|$|Benjamin Hudson {{suggested}} {{that it was only}} the vigorous campaigning by Niall Glúndub in Ulster and Connacht from 913 to 915, along with Óengus's fortuitous death, that led to Niall being named Flann's heir. Alex Woolf {{suggested that}} Flann had not only attempted to monopolise the succession within his family, but had <b>come</b> <b>close</b> to instituting a national kingship in Ireland comparable to that created by his contemporaries Alfred the Great and Edward the Elder in England from their Kingdom of Wessex.|$|E
5|$|Parizeau's stance created {{opposition}} in the sovereignty movement, which coalesced around Bloc Québécois leader Lucien Bouchard. A popular and charismatic figure, Bouchard had <b>come</b> <b>close</b> to death from necrotizing fasciitis and lost his left leg. His recovery, and subsequent public appearances on crutches, provided a rallying point for sovereigntists and the public at large. Bouchard thought a proposal lacking a partnership would doom the project among soft nationalists (such as himself) who worried about the economic consequences of separation.|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} of the Montana-class battleships {{would have}} been similar to the preceding Iowa-class battleships, but {{with an increase in}} the number of primary guns and more potent secondary guns for use against enemy surface ships and aircraft. Had they been completed, the Montanas {{would have been}} gun-for-gun the most powerful battleships the United States had constructed, and the only US battleship class that would have <b>come</b> <b>close</b> to equaling the Imperial Japanese Navy battleships Yamato and Musashi in armament, armor, and displacement.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of 1956, the Tories were led by former Ontario premier George A. Drew, who had been elected PC leader in 1948 over Saskatchewan MP John Diefenbaker. Drew was the fifth man to lead the Tories in their 21 years out of power. None had <b>come</b> <b>close</b> to {{defeating}} the Liberals; the best performance was in 1945, when John Bracken secured 67 seats for the Tories. The Liberals, though, had won 125seats, and maintained their majority. In the 1953 election, the PC party won 51seats out of the 265 in the House of Commons. Subsequently, the Tories picked up two seats from the Liberals in by-elections, and the Liberals (who had won 169seats in 1953) lost an additional seat to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF, the predecessor of the New Democratic Party (NDP)).|$|E
5|$|Charles X died in February 1660 and was {{succeeded by}} a regency council—led by {{the queen mother}} Hedvig Eleonora—that ruled {{in the name of}} Charles XI who was only four {{at the time of his}} father's death. Sweden had <b>come</b> <b>close</b> to almost {{complete}} control over trade in the Baltic, but the war revealed the need to work against the formation of anti-Swedish alliances that included Denmark, especially with France, the most powerful state in Europe at the time. There were some successes in foreign policy with the anti-French 1668 Triple Alliance of England, Sweden, and the Dutch Republic.|$|E
50|$|In {{the state}} competition, however, Coritiba's winning spell was over. They <b>came</b> <b>close</b> in 1995 in an {{exciting}} final against rival Paraná (team), but unfortunately Coritiba eventually lost the match, held in Pinheirão, 1-0. The team <b>came</b> <b>close</b> again in 1996, {{but did not}} reach the final.|$|R

5|$|Despite Vinokourov's hopes upon {{crashing}} out of {{the race}} that the squad would continue to be combative, they did not attain any noteworthy results over the remainder of the Tour. Grivko and Fofonov took top-ten stage placings from breakaways in stages 16 and 17, but did not <b>come</b> <b>close</b> to winning either day, finishing tenth and sixth respectively and over a minute off the winner's time both days. Vaitkus finished eighth on the Champs-Élysées stage to close out the Tour. The squad's best-placed rider in the final overall standings was Di Gregorio in 39th place, an hour and 22 minutes off Tour winner Cadel Evans' time.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, the Senators {{would sign}} Daigle to a $12.25 million contract, the largest rookie salary in League history, which {{would lead to}} a cap on rookie {{contracts}} a few years later. The club would promote Daigle over Alexei Yashin, nominating Daigle for rookie of the year over Yashin. His play did not justify full-time status and in 1995, coaches Rick Bowness and Alain Vigneault demoted Daigle to part-time status. The move led to Bowness and Vigneault being fired. In the end, Daigle did not <b>come</b> <b>close</b> to the career the Senators hoped for. After scoring only 74 goals in just over four seasons, he was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers, and is widely {{regarded as one of the}} biggest draft busts in sports history.|$|E
5|$|In the {{mandible}} (lower jaw), {{the upper}} and lower masseteric ridges <b>come</b> <b>close</b> together below the first molars, but do not fuse. The back end of the lower incisor root is in a capsular process, a raising of the mandibular bone behind the molars. The upper incisors have yellowish enamel and are opisthodont, with the cutting edge inclined backwards. The molars are relatively small and are brachydont (low-crowned) and bunodont (with the cusps higher than the connecting crests). They {{are similar to those of}} the marsh rice rat in structural details. The upper and lower first molars have small accessory roots, as in many other oryzomyines, and the second and third lower molar each have two roots only.|$|E

25|$|The United States takes a more laissez-faire approach, setting some minimum {{standards}} but leaving most workers' {{wages and benefits}} to collective bargaining and market forces.

5|$|It is rumoured that Briatore {{arranged}} {{an agreement}} with Red Bull that, if they offered Webber a race seat, Renault would supply them with engines. On 26 January 2007 the new Red Bull RB3 challenger was unveiled in Spain, and Webber drove the car in a shakedown in Barcelona on the same day. The car featured heavy revisions to the team's previous cars and looked very much like designer Adrian Newey's previous cars which had either won or <b>come</b> <b>close</b> to the World Title. The car was fitted with a Renault RS27 engine.|$|E
5|$|Philip Humber of the Chicago White Sox {{pitched a}} perfect {{game against the}} Seattle Mariners by {{retiring}} all 27 batters he faced on April 21, 2012, as the White Sox defeated the Mariners 40. It was the 21st perfect game in Major League Baseball (MLB) history and the third {{by a member of}} the White Sox. It was Humber's first career complete game, although he had <b>come</b> <b>close</b> to achieving no-hitters on several occasions at several levels of organized baseball. The game was played in Seattle and broadcast regionally by Fox Sports in the two teams' metropolitan areas.|$|E
5|$|Social wasps are {{considered}} pests {{when they become}} excessively common, or nest close to buildings. People are most often stung in late summer, when wasp colonies stop breeding new workers; the existing workers search for sugary foods {{and are more likely}} to come into contact with humans; if people then respond aggressively, the wasps sting. Wasp nests made in or near houses, such as in roof spaces, can present a danger as the wasps may sting if people <b>come</b> <b>close</b> to them. Stings are usually painful rather than dangerous, but in rare cases, people may suffer life-threatening anaphylactic shock.|$|E
