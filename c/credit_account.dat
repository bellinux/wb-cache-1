25|$|Bank {{statements}} are accounting records produced by banks under the various accounting {{standards of the}} world. Under GAAP {{there are two kinds}} of accounts: debit and credit. Credit accounts are Revenue, Equity and Liabilities. Debit Accounts are Assets and Expenses. The bank credits a <b>credit</b> <b>account</b> to increase its balance, and debits a <b>credit</b> <b>account</b> to decrease its balance.|$|E

Mervyn's kept its separate identity as a Dayton Hudson subsidiary. The average store had 80-130 employees. There was a Store Team Leader (1), Executive Team Leaders (2-4), Department Leaders (7-10), benefited team members (full-time employees {{not part of the}} leadership team), and part-time employees. All employees had [...] "credit goals", which referred to the number of customers that opened a Mervyn's <b>credit</b> <b>account.</b> Part-time employees were expected 1 per every 8 hours, and the leadership team was expected 1 per every 40 hours.|$|E

50|$|The most {{apparent}} {{cause of the}} bankruptcy was the company's decision to extend store credit to all customers, with no attempt made to assess the customer's ability to repay. Each of the company's stores had credit managers who authorized the opening of store <b>credit</b> <b>accounts,</b> which resulted in many customers having <b>credit</b> <b>accounts</b> {{with more than one}} of the company's stores. In addition, there existed no centralized control or record-keeping of store <b>credit</b> <b>accounts</b> which resulted in noncollectable <b>accounts.</b> The <b>credit</b> was recovered in 1976 by Irwin Jacobs who, with the backing of Carl Pohlad, purchased their consumer accounts receivable account of $276.3 million for $44 million and 5% of first-year sales (The Wall Street Journal July 30, 1980).|$|R
60|$|The new {{government}} was received with considerable coolness. It {{was not only}} a foreign intruder, but a poor one. It was not even worth plucking --except by the smallest of small fry office-seekers and such. Everybody knew that Congress had appropriated only twenty thousand dollars a year in greenbacks for its support--about money enough to run a quartz mill a month. And everybody knew, also, that the first year's money was still in Washington, and that the getting hold of it would be a tedious and difficult process. Carson City was too wary and too wise to open up a <b>credit</b> <b>account</b> with the imported bantling with anything like indecent haste.|$|E

60|$|Mr Pickering was convinced. His spirits soared. Marriage! What was marriage? Slavery, {{not to be}} endured by {{your man}} of spirit. Look at all the unhappy marriages you saw everywhere.

According to the novelists and playwrights, shrewd fellows who knew what was what, if you talked to your wife about your {{business}} she said you had no soul; if you didn't, she said you didn't think enough of her to let her share your life. If you gave her expensive presents and an unlimited <b>credit</b> <b>account,</b> she complained that you looked on her as a mere doll; and if you didn't, she called you a screw. That was marriage. If it didn't get you with the left jab, it landed on you with the right upper-cut. None of that sort of thing for Dudley Pickering.|$|E

60|$|There {{was nothing}} to arrest him for. That was not the least strange part of the career of the Wizard of Finance. For when all {{the affairs of the}} Erie Auriferous Consolidated were {{presently}} calculated up by the labours of Skinyer and Beatem and the legal representatives of the Orphans and the Idiots and the Deaf-mutes they resolved themselves into the most beautiful and complete cipher conceivable. The salted gold about paid for the cost of the incorporation certificate: the development capital had disappeared, and those who lost most preferred to say the least about it; and as for Tomlinson, if one added up his gains on the stock market before the fall and subtracted his bill at the Grand Palaver and the thousand dollars which he gave to Skinyer and Beatem to recover his freehold on the lower half of his farm, and the cost of three tickets to Cahoga station, the debit and <b>credit</b> <b>account</b> balanced to a hair.|$|E
60|$|Ill {{luck was}} {{in store for}} the expedition, however. On inquiry at the ticket-office they {{found that there was}} no train for upwards of two hours, and then it was a slow one which would not land them until eight o'clock at Bedsworth. At this piece of {{information}} Tom Dimsdale fairly broke down, and stamped about the station, raving and beseeching the officials to run a special, be the cost what it might. This, however, could by no means be done, owing to the press of Saturday traffic. There was nothing for it but to wait. The three foreigners went off in search of something to eat, and having found a convenient cookshop they disappeared therein and feasted royally at Von Baumser's expense. Major Tobias Clutterbuck remained with the young man, who resolutely refused to leave the platform. The major knew of a snug little corner not far off where he could have put in the time very comfortably, but he could not bring himself to desert his companion even for a minute. I have no doubt that that wait of two hours in the draughty station is marked up somewhere to the old sinner's <b>credit</b> <b>account.</b>|$|E

60|$|On September 1st Lord Roberts {{showed his}} sense of the decisive nature of these recent {{operations}} by publishing the proclamation which had been issued as early as July 4th, by which the Transvaal became {{a portion of the}} British Empire. On the same day General Buller, who had ceased to advance to the east and retraced his steps as far as Helvetia, began his northerly movement in the direction of Lydenburg, which is nearly fifty miles {{to the north of the}} railway line. On that date his force made a march of fourteen miles, which brought them over the Crocodile River to Badfontein. Here, on September 2nd, Buller found that the indomitable Botha was still turning back upon him, for he was faced by so heavy a shell fire, coming from so formidable a position, that he had to be content to wait in front of it until some other column should outflank it. The days of unnecessary frontal attacks were for ever over, and his force, though ready for anything which might be asked of it, had gone through a good deal in the recent operations. Since August 21st they had been under fire almost every day, and their losses, though never great on any one occasion, amounted in the aggregate during that time to 365. They had crossed the Tugela, they had relieved Ladysmith, they had forced Laing's Nek, and now it was to them that the honour had fallen of following the enemy into this last fastness. Whatever criticism may be directed against some episodes in the Natal campaign, it must never be forgotten that to Buller and to his men have fallen some of the hardest tasks of the war, and that these tasks have always in the end been successfully carried out. The controversy about the unfortunate message to White, and the memory of the abandoned guns at Colenso, must not lead us to the injustice of ignoring all that is to be set to the <b>credit</b> <b>account.</b>|$|E
