25|$|Tuning {{a control}} loop is the {{adjustment}} of its <b>control</b> <b>parameters</b> (proportional band/gain, integral gain/reset, derivative gain/rate) to the optimum {{values for the}} desired control response.

(Examples being the Moog Model D reissue, which was enhanced from its original design to offer both MIDI i/o and CV i/o). In these models of MIDI/CV hybrids, it is often possible to send and receive control voltages to <b>control</b> <b>parameters</b> of equipment at the identical time MIDI messages are being sent and received.|$|E

30|$|The above set of {{equations}} represents complete thermodynamic {{modeling of}} the cycle, whose solution gives the cycle performance as dependent on its <b>controlling</b> <b>parameters.</b> Following conventionally reported methods of varying {{one or two}} of the <b>controlling</b> <b>parameters</b> at a time while keeping the rest of the constants will produce some specific performance results that will be valid only for those specific variation cases and cannot be of general practical applicability. Besides, these conventional solution methods can result in localized optimized performance values that are dependent on the specific values selected for the <b>controlling</b> <b>parameters.</b> To overcome these two issues (i.e., the generalization of the study and the global optimization), the present paper has adapted the Monte Carlo methodology (MCM) that concurrently searches the variation ranges of all <b>controlling</b> <b>parameters</b> at the same time to optimize the cycle performance over the whole domain of variations of all cycle <b>controlling</b> <b>parameters.</b>|$|R

25|$|Some {{research}} groups have recently explored {{the use of}} quantum annealing hardware for training Boltzmann machines and deep neural networks. The standard approach to training Boltzmann machines relies on the computation of certain averages that can be estimated by standard sampling techniques, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Another possibility is {{to rely on a}} physical process, like quantum annealing, that naturally generates samples from a Boltzmann distribution. The objective is to find the optimal <b>control</b> <b>parameters</b> that best represent the empirical distribution of a given dataset.|$|E
25|$|Chaos {{theory has}} been used for many years in cryptography. In the past few decades, chaos and {{nonlinear}} dynamics have been used in the design of hundreds of cryptographic primitives. These algorithms include image encryption algorithms, hash functions, secure pseudo-random number generators, stream ciphers, watermarking and steganography. The majority of these algorithms are based on uni-modal chaotic maps and a big portion of these algorithms use the <b>control</b> <b>parameters</b> and the initial condition of the chaotic maps as their keys. From a wider perspective, without loss of generality, the similarities between the chaotic maps and the cryptographic systems is the main motivation for the design of chaos based cryptographic algorithms. One type of encryption, secret key or symmetric key, relies on diffusion and confusion, which is modeled well by chaos theory. Another type of computing, DNA computing, when paired with chaos theory, offers a way to encrypt images and other information. Many of the DNA-Chaos cryptographic algorithms are proven to be either not secure, or the technique applied is suggested to be not efficient.|$|E
