40|$|BACKGROUND The Food and Drug Administration can set {{standards}} that reduce the nicotine content of <b>cigarettes.</b> METHODS We conducted a double-blind, parallel, randomized clinical trial between June 2013 and July 2014 at 10 sites. Eligibility criteria included {{an age of}} 18 years or older, smoking of five or more <b>cigarettes</b> per day, and no current interest in quitting smoking. Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} smoke for 6 weeks either their usual brand of <b>cigarettes</b> or one of six types of investigational <b>cigarettes,</b> provided free. The investigational <b>cigarettes</b> had nicotine content ranging from 15. 8 mg per gram of tobacco (typical of commercial brands) to 0. 4 mg per gram. The primary outcome was the number of <b>cigarettes</b> smoked per day during week 6. RESULTS A total of 840 participants underwent randomization, and 780 completed the 6 -week study. During week 6, the average number of <b>cigarettes</b> smoked per day was lower for participants randomly assigned to <b>cigarettes</b> containing 2. 4, 1. 3, or 0. 4 mg of nicotine per gram of tobacco (16. 5, 16. 3, and 14. 9 <b>cigarettes,</b> respectively) than for participants randomly assigned to their usual brand or to <b>cigarettes</b> containing 15. 8 mg per gram (22. 2 and 21. 3 <b>cigarettes,</b> respectively; P < 0. 001). Participants assigned to <b>cigarettes</b> with 5. 2 mg per gram smoked an average of 20. 8 <b>cigarettes</b> per day, which did not differ significantly from the average number among those who smoked control <b>cigarettes.</b> <b>Cigarettes</b> with lower nicotine content, as compared with control <b>cigarettes,</b> reduced exposure to and dependence on nicotine, as well as craving during abstinence from smoking, without significantly increasing the expired carbon monoxide level or total puff volume, suggesting minimal compensation. Adverse events were generally mild and similar among groups. CONCLUSIONS In this 6 -week study, reduced-nicotine <b>cigarettes</b> versus standard-nicotine <b>cigarettes</b> reduced nicotine exposure and dependence and the number of <b>cigarettes</b> smoked.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{compare the}} {{nicotine}} content of 12  unfiltered brands of bidi <b>cigarettes</b> (hand rolled <b>cigarettes</b> imported from India) with 8  popular brands of filtered and unfiltered US and conventional <b>cigarettes</b> from India.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Identical laboratory procedures {{were used to}} determine nicotine content (in duplicate) and physical characteristics.  RESULTS—The nicotine concentration in the tobacco of bidi <b>cigarettes</b> (21. 2  mg/g) was significantly greater than the tobacco from the commercial filtered (16. 3  mg/g) and unfiltered <b>cigarettes</b> (13. 5 mg/g).  CONCLUSIONS—Bidi <b>cigarettes</b> contain higher concentrations of nicotine than conventional <b>cigarettes.</b> Therefore, it is logical to presume that bidi smokers are at risk of becoming nicotine dependent.

Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Skinner are unaware of FBI Special Agent Diana Fowley's (Mimi Rogers) duplicity—she is working for <b>Cigarette</b> Smoking Man (William B. Davis). Scully then travels to Africa to unravel the secrets of the alien artifacts, finding something that looks like a spaceship buried under the shoreline off the Côte d'Ivoire coast. The object may prove that life originated elsewhere, and all religion is based on the Navajo contact with alien life. Unsuccessful, Scully returns from Africa to revisit Mulder in Washington, D.C., but instead she finds out that he has disappeared.

Fifty-two (52) brands of <b>cigarettes</b> sold in Canada and 2 brands of Philip Morris's Merit <b>cigarettes</b> sold in the U. S. were tested. On the 15 -layer filter paper assembly, 51 brands of the <b>cigarettes</b> sold in Canada produced 90 to 100 % full-length burning. These <b>cigarettes</b> plus those 10 brands of the <b>cigarettes</b> tested previously (which produced 95 to 100 % full-length burning) have a relatively high propensity to ignite upholstered furniture if lit and dropped on soft furnishings. These high percentages of full-length burns demonstrate the need to make <b>cigarettes</b> less prone to cause fires.
