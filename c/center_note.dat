50|$|Each camera captures a 2D {{image of}} the 3D world. This {{conversion}} from 3D to 2D {{is referred to as}} a perspective projection and is described by the pinhole camera model.

50|$|Other {{lines of}} {{research}} on perceptions of science among the American public conclude that most religious groups see no general epistemological conflict with science {{and they have no}} differences with nonreligious groups in the propensity of seeking out scientific knowledge, although there may be subtle epistemic or moral conflicts when scientists make counterclaims to religious tenets. Findings from the Pew <b>Center</b> <b>note</b> similar findings and also note that the majority of Americans (80-90%) show strong support for scientific research, agree that science makes society and individual's lives better, and 8 in 10 Americans would be happy if their children were to become scientists. Even strict creationists tend to have very favorable views on science.|$|E

Also worthy of note is that STS-3 was the first mission where the external fuel tank was left the unpainted copper color which would become an iconic visual feature of the space shuttles from then on. The first two missions had tanks painted white, this elimination saved some weight (about 600 lbs/272 kg). Decades later some questioned if the paint might have prevented the ice-soaked foam shedding issue {{that lead to the}} destruction of Columbia.|$|E

The inner circle marks the 100 km distance from the <b>center.</b> <b>Note</b> that the outcrops (exposure of the rocks on the surface) of Witwatersrand rocks (yellow areas) are located at 25 km from the epicenter of the impact and then again at about 80-120 km from the epicenter. The locations of important towns and cities in the region are indicate in the appropriate places.

50|$|In {{the spring}} of 2008 the Hang makers {{announced}} a new version, the Integral Hang. Numbers began again with an H in front (H1, H2, etc.) and with the first Integral Hang dated in November 2007. Several changes marked the Integral Hang. There was only one scale with seven tone fields in the cycle (D3 Ding, A3, B3, C4, D4, E4, F4, A4) and no other sound models offered. The Gu hole was adjusted to a subtly oval shape to improve the tuning of the three partials D5, F5 and an F5 of the Gu neck. Significant changes {{were made to the}} Ding (<b>center</b> <b>note</b> on the top). A circular indentation in the dome was made and has a texture of brass applied, annealed, and then lacquered. Also changes to the shoulder area between the flattened area of the Ding and the notes in the tone circle were implemented so that the transition was more gradual than in the 2nd generation Hanghang. The PANArt logo, serial number, date of finalization, and signatures of the Hang makers were placed on Gu side of the Hang near the equator where the two shells meet.|$|E

5000|$|On September 12, {{satellite}} images {{indicated that the}} eighteenth tropical depression of the season formed southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Located {{in close proximity to}} Tropical Storm Norbert, the depression would soon enter a region of colder sea surface temperatures, and the National Hurricane <b>Center</b> <b>noted</b> that only very little intensification was possible. As predicted, Norbert hindered further intensification of Tropical Depression Eighteen-E. The National Hurricane <b>Center</b> <b>noted</b> six hours later that the depression would likely be absorbed into Norbert. The National Hurricane Center later believed that Tropical Depression Eighteen-E was [...] "dominating" [...] the interaction between the two systems, and was forecast to absorb Norbert. Unlike the latter prediction, Norbert absorbed Tropical Depression Eighteen-E later that day.|$|R
5000|$|For a given pair of circles, the {{internal}} and external homothetic centers may be found in various ways. In analytic geometry, {{the internal}} homothetic center is the weighted average of the centers of the circles, weighted by the opposite circle's radius - distance from center of circle to inner center is proportional to that radius, so weighting is proportional to the opposite radius. Denoting the centers of the circles [...] and [...] by [...] and [...] and their radii by [...] and [...] and denoting the center by [...] this is:The external center can be computed by the same equation, but considering one of the radii as negative; either one yields the same equation, which is:More generally, taking both radii with the same sign (both positive or both negative) yields the inner center, while taking the radii with opposite signs (one positive and the other negative) yields the outer <b>center.</b> <b>Note</b> that the equation for the inner center is valid for any values (unless both radii zero or one is the negative of the other), but the equation for the external center requires that the radii be different, otherwise it involves division by zero.|$|E

5|$|After {{weakening}} to a Category1 hurricane on September30, the National Hurricane <b>Center</b> <b>noted</b> {{that very}} cold cloud tops still existed, though IR imagery {{indicated that the}} convection and circulation associated with the storm was becoming asymmetrical. Isaac remained a Category1 hurricane for almost 24hours, at which time the storm began to accelerate east-northeastward. Early on October1, the National Hurricane <b>Center</b> <b>noted</b> that minimal deep convection persisted near the center {{and much of it}} was displaced to the north. Mid-level dry air and low-level cold air began entering the western quadrant of the storm, which caused it to begin its extratropical transition. By 0600UTC on October1, Isaac weakened to a tropical storm. The National Hurricane <b>Center</b> <b>noted</b> that further weakening would be slow, due to the large wind field associated with the storm. At 1500UTC on October1, the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory on the storm; Isaac fully transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about three hours later, while located about halfway between Newfoundland and the Azores. The extratropical remnants tracked rapidly east-northeastward and affected the British Isles on October3 and October4, eventually merging with another extratropical low while north of Scotland early on October4.|$|R
