5000|$|From {{the outset}} the films and {{vaudeville}} acts were accompanied at the piano. Billy Good, the pianist from 1920-1922 recalled the very long hours worked {{by all the}} staff and particularly himself arduously craning up at the screen from the rather dingy pit recessed into {{the floor in front}} of the stage. However, the 'pit neck ache' didn't matter since he was 100% engrossed in the music and loved every minute of it playing two houses every night except Sunday for £1-15s-0d. a week. Billy's career changed course in 1922 when one day a potato <b>chip</b> <b>machine</b> took slices from his fingers rather than the potato. He carried on playing 'with left thumb and little finger 'hors-de-combat' but it didn't take 'old Gilbert', the manager, long to notice the difference. He poked his head over the pit rail and said [...] "You young rascal, you've got a bloody cheek" [...] which under the circumstances was rather appropriate, and possibly literally true. So Billy went off to sea to harden up his injured fingers and when the cinema reopened in 1981 Billy Good, by then in his eighties, returned to the cinema to provide musical accompaniment once again to the occasional silent film.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The short {{shelf-life}} and bulkiness of cassava roots pose a great {{problem in}} transporting these roots {{from the farm}} to the market or factory sites. To overcome this difficulty in the marketing and utilization of cassava and to avoid heavy post-harvest losses, the roots need to be processed into some form of dried product with longer shelf life. The simplest and most common mode of processing cassava is {{the conversion of the}} roots into dry chips. Cassava processing into chips by traditional methods which involve the use of knife is labour- intensive but the application of improved processing technology has reduced processing time and labour and encouraged further production. An improved cassava <b>chipping</b> <b>machine,</b> with <b>chip</b> thickness between 3 - 6 mm was designed to enhance the processing of cassava into chips to catalyze its drying period and preserve its nutritional value. The <b>chipping</b> <b>machine</b> consists of a hopper, a cutter plate and a power transmission system powered by a 1 hp electric motor. Computer Aided Design software was used in the design and appropriate material selection was considered for its fabrication. The cassava <b>chipping</b> <b>machine</b> was also simulated for stress analysis and behaviour of the machine was studied when loaded virtually. Chipping efficiency is 94. 75 %, machine capacity is 0. 04 kg/sec, chipping rate is 0. 034 kg/sec which {{is a function of the}} force applied...|$|R

40|$|A direct {{consolidation}} of brass <b>machined</b> <b>chips</b> wastes has been attempted from a viewpoint of energy-saving and recyclability. A direct consolidation process from <b>machined</b> <b>chips</b> wastes has successfully {{been developed in}} our laboratory. So a free-cutting brass without Pb has been developed using this consolidation process in our laboratory by adding graphite powder and Cu 2 S powder as a substitution for Pb.

In this study, therefore, a surface of 6 - 4 brass <b>machined</b> <b>chips</b> was oxidized and dezincificated by heating in air in order to suppress the formation of ZnS.

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanical}} properties, {{wear and}} corrosion behavior of copper matrix composites reinforced with steel <b>machining</b> <b>chips</b> {{was investigated in}} this research. Steel <b>machining</b> <b>chips</b> with chip size range of 105 μm and below were utilized to develop stir cast copper matrix composites having 5, 7. 5 and 10 wt% of the chips as reinforcement. Unreinforced copper and 10 wt% alumina reinforced copper matrix composites were also prepared for control experimentation. Hardness and tensile properties evaluation, wear test, potentiodynamic polarization corrosion tests, and optical microscopy; were used as basis to characterize the composites produced. The {{results show that the}} addition of steel <b>machining</b> <b>chips</b> in copper resulted in significantly low porosity levels in the copper matrix composites compared with the use of alumina as reinforcement. The mechanical properties (hardness and tensile properties) and wear resistance were also observed to improve {{with the use of the}} steel <b>machining</b> <b>chips</b> as reinforcement. The corrosion susceptibility in 3. 5 wt% NaCl solution were observed to be more intense for the unreinforced copper and the alumina reinforced composite grade compared with the steel chips reinforced copper matrix composites.

This paper presents a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) to optimize the sequence of component placements and the arrangement of component types to feeders simultaneously for a <b>chip</b> shooter <b>machine,</b> that is, the component scheduling problem. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total assembly time. The GA developed in the paper hybridizes different search heuristics including the nearest-neighbor heuristic, the 2 -opt heuristic, and an iterated swap procedure, which is a new improved heuristic. Compared with the results obtained by other researchers, the performance of the HGA is superior in terms of the assembly time.

40|$|Although the {{occurrence}} of tool wear can affect cutting forces, cutting <b>chip</b> morphologies, and <b>machined</b> surface quality in ultra-precision fly cutting (UPFC), {{there has been no}} research in this area due to the complex cutting mechanism of UPFC. The theoretical and experimental research described in this paper was therefore conducted to explore tool wear characteristics in UPFC and their relationship to cutting forces, cutting <b>chip</b> morphologies, and <b>machined</b> surface quality. Results from the study reveal that tool wear characteristics in UPFC include cutting edge fractures, workpiece material welding, wear land formation, sub-wear land formation, and micro-grooves. The cutting edge fractures lead to the formation of ridges on both the cutting <b>chips</b> and <b>machined</b> surface; the material welding increases the thrust force, crushes cutting chips, and deteriorates the machined surface quality; and the formation of wear land on the cutting edge makes the machined surface burred and fuzzy, and the micro-grooves leave some traces on the machined surface. By analyzing the captured cutting force, it is found that the progress of tool wear in UPFC can increase the cutting force and its power spectral density at the natural frequency of the dynamometer. Findings from the research provide rich insight into the relationships of tool wear characteristics to cutting forces, <b>chip</b> formation, and <b>machined</b> surface quality in intermittent cutting processes.
