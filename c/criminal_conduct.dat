5|$|The Office of the Special Prosecutor {{was founded}} {{with the passage}} of a bill in the Icelandic {{parliament}} 10 December 2008. The aim was to investigate suspected <b>criminal</b> <b>conduct</b> leading up to, in connection with or {{in the wake of the}} banking crisis, whether these relate to the activities of financial undertakings, other legal entities or individuals, and, as appropriate, to follow up these investigations by bringing charges in court against those concerned.|$|E

25|$|People learn crime through association. These acts may condone <b>criminal</b> <b>conduct,</b> or justify crime under {{specific}} circumstances.

25|$|Public {{international}} law deals extensively and increasingly with <b>criminal</b> <b>conduct</b> that is heinous and ghastly enough to affect entire societies and regions. The formative source of modern {{international criminal law}} was the Nuremberg trials following the Second World War in which the leaders of Nazism were prosecuted for their part in genocide and atrocities across Europe. The Nuremberg trials {{marked the beginning of}} criminal fault for individuals, where individuals acting on behalf of a government can be tried for violations of {{international law}} without the benefit of sovereign immunity. In 1998 an International criminal court was established in the Rome Statute.|$|E
25|$|Both Monserrate and Espada faced {{accusations of}} {{unethical}} or <b>criminal</b> <b>conduct.</b> Monserrate was indicted for felony assault in March {{and would have}} automatically lost his seat if convicted. New York, like most states, has a provision in its state constitution which bars convicted felons from holding office. (Monseratte would be acquitted of the felonies, but was convicted on misdemeanors.) Espada {{was the target of}} a state investigation into whether he funded his campaign with money siphoned from a nonprofit health care agency he controls. The Bronx County District Attorney's office was also investigating charges that Espada actually resided in Mamaroneck, Westchester County rather than the north Bronx district he represented.|$|E
25|$|In his 1998 reelection {{campaign}} against Democrat Ben Odom, Watts faced accusations about debts, unpaid taxes and over actions {{in a federal}} bribery investigation in 1991, where he arranged to receive campaign contributions from a lobbyist for telephone companies that were investigated during Watts' membership on the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. Odom used portions of a transcript to try to discredit Watts, and the accusations were widely publicized in Oklahoma. Watts argued he had been exonerated from any <b>criminal</b> <b>conduct</b> and that his financial problems were a result of losses for Oklahoma oil and gas businesses during the 1980s.

25|$|Ward {{was sentenced}} to 33 months in prison, {{followed}} by three years of probation, and ordered to make restitution of $200,000 {{to one of the}} defrauded insurance companies. Upon his release, Ward sued the AHSA, which had barred him from attending its sanctioned shows. He claimed that it was his right, as a private citizen and no longer a member of the AHSA, to watch his son compete in equestrian events. In 2000, the Supreme Court of New York found that argument meritless, ruling that Ward's membership in AHSA {{at the time of his}} <b>criminal</b> <b>conduct,</b> plus his promise to be bound by the organization's rules, authorized the AHSA to discipline him, regardless of his current membership status.|$|E
25|$|Drug {{sentencing}} guidelines {{under state law}} in America are generally much less harsh than the federal {{sentencing guidelines}}, although great irregularities exist. The vast majority of drug felonies and almost all drug misdemeanors in the United States are prosecuted at the state level. The federal government tends to prosecute only drug trafficking cases involving large amounts of drugs, or cases which have been referred to federal prosecutors by local district attorneys seeking the harsher sentences provided under the federal sentencing guidelines. In rare instances, some defendants are prosecuted both federally and by the state for the same drug trafficking conduct. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that a defendant does not face double jeopardy if he is convicted and sentenced by {{both the state and}} federal government for the same underlying <b>criminal</b> <b>conduct.</b>|$|E

25|$|At {{constituency}} level, related alleged breaches {{of spending}} regulations led to 'unprecedented' police investigations for possible <b>criminal</b> <b>conduct</b> of between 20 and 30 Conservative Party MPs. However, on 9 May 2017, the Crown Prosecution service {{decided not to}} prosecute {{the vast majority of}} suspects, saying that 'in order to bring a charge, it must be proved that a suspect knew the return was inaccurate and acted dishonestly in signing the declaration. Although there is evidence to suggest the returns may have been inaccurate, there is insufficient evidence to prove to the criminal standard that any candidate or agent was dishonest.' However, on 2 June 2017, charges were brought under the Representation of the People Act 1983 against Craig Mackinlay, who was elected Conservative MP for South Thanet in 2015, his agent Nathan Gray, and a party activist, Marion Little. Appearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 4 July 2017, the three pleased not guilty and were released on unconditional bail pending an appearance at Southwark Crown Court on 1 August 2017. The investigation of Party Treasurer Simon Day remained ongoing.|$|E
