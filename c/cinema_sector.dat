40|$|The <b>cinema</b> {{exhibition}} <b>sector</b> in Spain, {{as well as}} in {{the rest}} of Europe, is a dynamic sector characterised by the present growth of multiplexes and consumer demand after a long period of decline. These changes make it relevant to analyse the cinema attendees' profile from a marketing perspective. To this end, we have developed an exploratory study on segmentation applied to the young cinema attendees. Doing so, we have found three different groups according to benefits sought in their going to the cinema and other demographic and behavioural variables. On the basis of information as such, specific marketing objectives could be set and more efficient strategies designed and implemented.

40|$|Posters {{are one of}} the {{advertising}} tools used to promote a product. Especially in the <b>cinema</b> <b>sector,</b> the tools used to attract viewer attention are rather limited. In this case, movie posters have a big task. Because audiences like a film poster that does not have an idea about the film and they might go for it. In such a case, we can think that the posters of the films which entered the first five in the internet movie database known as IMDB in 2016 are also the effects of the number of films watched. For this reason, these five most watched film posters have been examined in terms of typographic. Similarities and differences were sought according to filmin category in the typographies of the films encountered...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews Italian {{audiovisual}} policies, {{in order}} to assess their impact on the international position of domestic cinema and television producers. Italian audiovisual policies are characterised by a rich set of institutions, regulations and support tools, whose complexity sometimes causes problems of overlapping jurisdictions among different authorities and agencies. Their degree of market access restrictiveness appears to be relatively high, especially considering the discrimination between European and non-European producers. The economic performance of the Italian audiovisual sector has been relatively weak in the nineties, particularly for what concerns the competition with foreign producers. On the other hand, the econometric exercise presented in section 5 seems to show that, at least in the <b>cinema</b> <b>sector,</b> public subsidies {{have a positive impact on}} the domestic market share of Italian producers. This preliminary conclusion is however not enough to justify a positive assessment of Italian audiovisual policies. Many important issues require further investigations. The problems and the data presented in this paper seem to confirm the need to reform the strategy and the tools of public intervention in the audiovisual sector. International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
50|$|Jayan quotes (ജയൻ ചൊല്ലുകൾ) or Jayan dialogues (ജയൻ ഡയലോഗുകൾ) are satirical quotes of superhuman {{strength}} in malayalam {{that are based}} on the late action star Jayan who was a famed stunt performer during his movie career. Jayan worked in malayalam <b>cinema,</b> a <b>sector</b> of the Indian movie industry based in Kerala and was a highly popular stunt actor of his time. Jayan quotes began as an internet & sms phenomenon amongst malayalees around the world in the early 2000s as part of the Jayan phenomenon & resurgence which started in the late 1990s. These satirical quotes are the first known collection of its kind from anywhere in the world (other factoids like those on Chuck Norris, Kyle Katarn, Rajnikanth, Dharmendra etc. emerged later after 2004). Soon the quotes attained mainstream popularity and have {{become an integral part of}} popular culture in Kerala.|$|R
40|$|At {{the heart}} (literally) of 21 Grams (2003) {{is a concern}} about {{questions}} of identity; of measuring that which seems ineffable – the essence of life, or what makes us distinct, unique as individuals, or otherwise. My aim in {{this paper is to}} use the film to attempt a similar, if less lofty, enquiry into the current identity of American independent <b>cinema,</b> a <b>sector</b> that often seems equally resistant to being clearly or definitively pinned down and categorized. 21 Grams is a useful exemplar of a number of significant trends in the contemporary indie sector, including both its situation in the industrial landscape and its most distinctive formal qualities. Industrially, the film lies in a position poised between all-out independence and attachment to the empires of the Hollywood major studio-distribution operations. Formally, and in the intersection between form and content, it also occupies a something of a hybrid position: alternative in some dimensions, especially its narrative structure and the use of hyper-realistic visual textures, but also more familiar-conventional in others, including a storyline that might otherwise seem closer to the stuff of somewhat implausible melodrama. In each case, I suggest, this can be taken as representative of a significant proportion of the American independent sector more widely...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the first}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1947, France {{has insisted that}} {{cultural}} products are different from other traded goods and should be exempted from ongoing liberalisation of international trade – a principle known as the ‘cultural exception’. This exclusion allows France to implement policies in favour of its cultural industries, particularly a highly complex system of quotas and subsidies for the film industry which it maintains is essential to counter US market dominance and maintain cultural diversity. Over the past decade, the launch of video-on-demand services has revolutionised how films are delivered and consumed. Policy-makers have attempted {{to keep pace with}} these developments, expanding the scope of French support schemes accordingly. Adopting a mixed methods approach, this thesis analyses cultural diversity in the French film industry in detail, incorporating for the first time both the <b>cinema</b> and video-on-demand <b>sectors</b> and combining qualitative and quantitative data to understand the impact of French policies on diversity. Quantitative analysis reveals strong evidence of diversity in both sectors but that, while digital channels offer greater variety of choice, cinema is more balanced between films of different geographic origins. Employing a consistent approach to policy development in both channels, policy-makers have failed to take into account these and other differences, or to target measures at the emerging threats to diversity in the digital environment – potentially undermining the French defence of the cultural exception on diversity grounds. There is a surprisingly superficial use of the term cultural diversity in trade circles, leading to the conclusion that a more sophisticated approach is needed. Refining French policy in line with empirical data and actively using that evidence to demonstrate policy success will be a necessary part of this more sophisticated approach if France is to successfully defend the cultural exception in future trade negotiations...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{approval}} of the UNESCO’s Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, and its recent ratification by the needed 30 countries, we propose an exploratory analysis of the supplied diversity of the <b>cinema</b> <b>sector</b> in the Euro-Mediterranean area. In a particular context of countries that lack a consistent film production sector, this exploratory study tries to identify how globalization affects the production, distribution and exhibition sectors, in what relates to cultural diversity considering the pressures for cultural homogeneity and concentration. Conjugating the multidimensional approach to the concept of “cultural diversity ” suggested by Benhamou and Peltier (2006) with the cinema value chain model, we will try to evaluate variety, disparity and proportion, in the production, distribution and exhibition phases of the cinema industry’s value chain. Following a literature review, we are departing from the hypothesis that there is a poor degree of diversity in the cinema supply in the area, and we have determined a number of variables {{that will allow us to}} access the actual degree of diversity by establishing comparisons among the different Euro-Mediterranean countries ’ realities...|$|E
40|$|Australia is on {{the path}} to {{achieving}} a full-scale conversion to digital cinema exhibition probably within the next five to ten years. Despite early optimism that digitization could provide a catalyst for greater democratization of the Australian exhibition market by creating more opportunities for audiences to see independent and alternate films, this outcome now appears far from certain. The launch and ongoing roll-out of the international standard for digital exhibition, which is now firmly controlled by the major American studios, is intensifying, rather than diminishing, the market dominance of these media conglomerates and their local allies, the major Australian exhibition chains. Independent film exhibition and alternative presentation formats, on the other hand, are being pushed even further to the periphery by these increasingly centralized market forces. While independent and major exhibitors have historically coexisted, although at times in a somewhat uneasy relationship, the financial imperatives of digital cinema now threaten to drive many independent cinemas to the edge, and with them the ongoing diversity of cinema culture in Australia. Of particular concern is the fate of independent theatres in regional and rural locations where many provide the only public screening opportunities within large geographic areas. This article outlines digital developments in Australia's commercial cinema industry within a national and international context, and in doing so considers the impact of digital exhibition technologies on Australia's independent <b>cinema</b> <b>sector.</b> Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|This study, {{starting}} from {{the analysis of the}} journal The Young Cinema (Genç Sinema), which was issued sixteen volumes between October 1968 and April 1971, aims to analyze how the namesake cinema group organized around the journal, The Young Cinema perceives their socio-politic conjunctures and how this perception is reflected on the perspective of their own cinema. The study claims that a cinema movement/group appeared at a certain period or era or the improvement thereof, is influenced to a great extent by the cinematic developments in the previous and/or contemporary period as well as the sociopolitical climate in which it is situated. From this point forth, this study tries to analyze the influences of cinema movements germinating on a national and international scale in the 1960 s and the highly politicized social context on the emergence of Young Cinema and exemplify this influence through the articles and essays in the journal. This study points out that the subject group has the two characteristics of the cinematic movements in the 1960 s (despite the differences in dimension and degree). These characteristics are the opposition to the dominant economic relations (capitalism) and ideology (imperialism) of the era in which it emerged and the disengagement from the international (Hollywood) and national (for Young Cinema – Yesilçam) <b>cinema</b> <b>sector.</b> The fact that Young Cinema Group is oppositional to the existing economic and political system and is inspirational for a new system conduces the group to co-operate with the revolutionist young movements on a operational and theoretical level as well as to perceive cinema as tool in the realization of the revolution (the prior aim of the group). Simultaneously, the disengagement from Yesilçam, which symbolizes the dependence on imperialist powers and the reflection of capitalist-imperialist infrastructure causes the members in the Young Cinema to discuss the ways to found an independent structure which will completely isolate them from the existing system and the ways to integrate their films into the organizational process created by the alternative economic relations of this independent structure. This study examines all the above-mentioned subject matters by referring to the articles and discussions in the Group’s Journal on a fundamental level as well as to oral history studies carried out with some of the representatives of the Group...|$|E
