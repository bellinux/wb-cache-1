About 2,000years ago, some groups began growing corn and other crops, leading to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle. Later groups in this period built permanent villages called pueblos. Archaeologists <b>call</b> <b>this</b> <b>the</b> Archaic period and it lasted until about 500CE. Baskets, cordage nets, and yucca fiber sandals have been found and dated to this period. The Archaic toolkits included flaked stone knives, drills, and stemmed dart points. The dart points were attached to wooden shafts and propelled by throwing devices called atlatls.|$|E

500|$|Paley's {{argument}} is built mainly around anatomy and natural history. [...] "For my part", he says, [...] "I take my stand in human anatomy"; elsewhere he insists upon [...] "the necessity, in each particular case, of an intelligent designing {{mind for the}} contriving and determining of the forms which organized bodies bear". In making his argument, Paley employed {{a wide variety of}} metaphors and analogies. Perhaps the most famous is his analogy between a watch and the world. Historians, philosophers and theologians often <b>call</b> <b>this</b> <b>the</b> watchmaker analogy. Building on this mechanical analogy, Paley presents examples from planetary astronomy and argues that the regular movements of the solar system resemble the workings of a giant clock. [...] To bolster his views he cites the work of his old friend John Law and the Dublin Astronomer Royal John Brinkley.|$|E

500|$|Paraguay {{was one of}} {{the most}} loosely {{controlled}} parts of the Spanish Empire by the Crown, with a strong independent streak in its leadership. [...] This partially stemmed from a quirk of history in 1537. [...] Shortly after the first settlements on the Rio de la Plata were made, Governor Pedro de Mendoza died. [...] The crown subsequently issued a Royal Decree (...) , which stated that if Mendoza had named a successor, that successor was confirmed as governor. [...] However, if Mendoza had not named a successor - or the successor was dead - a replacement should be [...] "peaceably elected." [...] An election was a unique privilege in Spain's American colonies; historian Adalberto López calls it [...] "strange" [...] as King Charles V was a ruthless centralizer who spent much of his reign curtailing the autonomy of Spain's various holdings, especially since Paraguay was still thought to hold precious metals at the time. [...] A further oddity is that the decree did not limit the use of election to a one-time exigency. [...] The citizens of Paraguay used the decree to elect a governor, and would use it many more times to not merely elect replacement governors, but also to depose disliked appointed governors. [...] The decree of 1537 was used again in 1544 to justify a coup against Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, who had reigned as governor for only two years. [...] Cabeza de Vaca had attempted to control the settlers' abuse of the native Indians, earning him the dislike of many of the colonists. [...] He was arrested, a replacement governor was proclaimed, and he was sent back to Spain in chains with a number of likely false crimes accused of him. [...] Some Paraguayan historians would later attempt to tie this 1544 coup to the Revolt of the Comuneros in Castile from 1520–1521 and <b>call</b> <b>this</b> <b>the</b> [...] "First Revolt of the Comuneros of Paraguay." [...] While Cabeza de Vaca had been part of the royalist forces in that earlier struggle and had helped defeat the Castilian comuneros, it is unlikely that contemporary Paraguayans identified themselves with the Castilian comuneros, according to López. [...] As the plotters hoped to attain legitimacy for their choice of governor in the eyes of the king, identifying themselves with despised rebels would have been counterproductive. [...] Rather, the main contemporary references to the Paraguayans calling themselves comuneros come from sources friendly to Cabeza de Vaca seeking to discredit the coup in the eyes of the king.|$|E

2500|$|Anabolic steroids are artificially {{produced}} hormones called androgens, {{which are}} essentially male-type sex hormones in the body. [...] The {{most powerful of}} the androgens is testosterone. [...] Another group of steroids are steroidal supplements, a weaker form of androgens. [...] Steroids and supplements are controversial when used for sports because of the health risks associated with them. [...] Some serious and long-term effects on the body are hair loss, dizziness, mood swings, delusions, paranoia, high blood pressure, and increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and even cancer. More recent studies also suggest that steroid users have {{an increased risk of}} depression and alcohol use later in life.

Compared to this, thrash metal sounds tame, the Stooges sound constrained, hardcore punk seems neutered, and the Sex Pistols sound like wimps. Rock & roll is about the fire in the performance, and nothing sounds as fiery as this; nothing hits as hard or sounds as loud, either.

In a {{surprise}} move, the longtime fan favorite Hogan then performed two Atomic Legdrops to Savage, revealing himself to be Hall and Nash's partner as The Outsiders returned to the ring to celebrate their new alliance as the stunned crowd looked on. The match officially ended in a no-contest after Hogan threw the referee out of the ring and hit Savage with one more Atomic Legdrop. After the main event, the audience began to throw trash in the ring. Gene Okerlund entered the ring and asked Hogan why he had turned his back on the fans and how he could align himself with Hall and Nash. Hogan claimed that the three of them were [...] "the future of wrestling" [...] and said that [...] "you can <b>call</b> <b>this</b> <b>the</b> new world order of wrestling, brother." [...] Hogan went on to justify his actions, saying he was bored with WCW and had grown tired of constantly pandering to the fans, especially considering that more and more of them had started to turn on him since he had joined the company in 1994. Hogan declared their intention to take over the wrestling business and destroy everything in their path.|$|E
