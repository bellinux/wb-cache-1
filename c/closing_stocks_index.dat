The data for the selected equity markets of Asian countries is obtained from Yahoo finance.com. The observations consist of <b>stock</b> price <b>indices</b> which consist of daily <b>closing</b> <b>stock</b> <b>indices.</b> The <b>closing</b> <b>stock</b> price <b>indices</b> consist of five working days from Monday to Friday. As this study considered daily data, so there were missing observations in many stock market data. The missing values have been calculated by using interpolation method. This is done in order to capture daily volatility spillover. The data for <b>stock</b> <b>indices</b> has been matched {{with each other in}} terms of dates in order to have daily analyses. This study considered Asian countries’ stock markets. This study has taken three countries from South Asia and three from East Asia. The countries selected from South Asia are India, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan. The countries taken from East Asia are Japan, Hong Kong, and China. Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) is the major market in Pakistan and is considered in this study. The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) has been selected from India. The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) is selected from Sri Lanka. The Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) is selected from China. The Hang Seng Stock Exchange (HSSE) is selected from Hong Kong.

40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of four volatility forecasting models, i. e. Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroscedastic (GARCH), in four stock markets Indonesia, Malaysia, Japan and Hong Kong. Using monthly <b>closing</b> <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> prices collected from 1 st January 1998 to 31 st December 2015 for the four selected countries, results obtained confirm that volatility in developed markets is not necessarily always lower than the volatility in emerging markets. Among all the three models, GARCH (1, 1) model {{is found to be}} the best forecasting model for stock markets in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Japan, while EWMA model is found to be the best forecasting model for Hong Kong stock market.

30|$|Accurate {{forecasting}} {{of changes}} in <b>stock</b> market <b>indices</b> can provide financial managers and individual investors with strategically valuable information. However, predicting the <b>closing</b> prices of <b>stock</b> <b>indices</b> remains a challenging task because stock price movements are characterized by high volatility and nonlinearity. This paper proposes a novel condensed polynomial neural network (CPNN) for the task of forecasting <b>stock</b> <b>closing</b> price <b>indices.</b> We developed a model that uses partial descriptions (PDs) and is limited to only two layers for the PNN architecture. The outputs of these PDs along with the original features are fed to a single output neuron, and the synaptic weight values and biases of the CPNN are optimized by a genetic algorithm. The proposed model was evaluated by predicting the next day’s closing price of five fast-growing stock indices: the BSE, DJIA, NASDAQ, FTSE, and TAIEX. In comparative testing, the proposed model proved its ability to provide closing price predictions with superior accuracy. Further, the Deibold-Mariano test justified the statistical significance of the model, establishing that this approach can be adopted as a competent financial forecasting tool.|$|R

These weights and the returns of the various indices were then {{used to determine the}} common component of stock market returns. Our results suggest that a common component of the Asia-Pacific stock market returns exists, which significantly explains the individual country’s stock market returns. We also find that stock markets of Korea and Hong Kong are the two most sensitive to changes in the common component stock returns, while China’s stock market is the least sensitive. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} extreme values is of crucial {{interest}} in many contexts. The concentration of pollutants, the sea-level and the <b>closing</b> prices of <b>stock</b> <b>indexes</b> {{are only a}} few examples in which the occurrence of extreme values may lead to important consequences. In the present paper we are interested in detecting trend in sample extremes. A common statistical approach used to identify trend in extremes is based on the generalized extreme value distribution, which constitutes a building block for parametric models. However, semiparametric procedures imply several advantages when exploring data and checking the model. This paper outlines a semiparametric approach for smoothing sample extremes, based on nonlinear dynamic modelling of the generalized extreme value distribution.

The study reveals that the ASEAN stock markets are going towards a greater integration either among themselves or with the US and Japan, particularly in the post- 1997 financial turmoil. This implies that the long-run diversification benefits that can be gained by investors across the ASEAN markets tend to diminish. As {{for the long run}} causal relations between ASEAN stock markets with the US and Japan, the study discovers that Indonesia was relatively independent of both the US and Japan; Malaysia was more dependent on Japan rather than the US; Thailand was relatively independent of the US, but to some extent dependent on Japan; the Philippines is more affected by the US than Japan; and the US and Japan have bidirectional Granger causalities with Singapore.

The data of all the selected exchange rates for the selected countries is in local currency in terms of US dollar. The data of stock prices and exchange rates consist of 5 trading days i.e. from Monday to Friday. As this study is considering daily data so there were missing observations in many countries data. It is basically due to non-trading at a particular date. The missing observations have been calculated by using interpolation method. This is done in order to capture daily volatility spillover between the two markets. The data of stock prices and exchange rates for each country has been matched with each other on daily basis. The data is considered closing prices of both stock market and foreign exchange market in a specific country to avoid timing conflict and to capture volatility transmission. This is done for the purpose of examining volatility spillover aspects on daily basis.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, the {{analysis}} of the transmissions of international nancial events has become the subject of many academic studies focused on multivariate volatility models volatility. The goal {{of this study is to}} evaluate the nancial contagion between stock market returns. The econometric approach employed was originally presented by Pelletier (2006), named Regime Switching Dynamic Correlation (RSDC). This methodology involves the combination of Constant Conditional Correlation Model (CCC) proposed by Bollerslev (1990) with Markov Regime Switching Model suggested by Hamilton and Susmel (1994). A modi cation was made in the original RSDC model, the introduction of the GJR-GARCH model formulated in Glosten, Jagannathan e Runkle (1993), on the equation of the conditional univariate variances to allow asymmetric e ects in volatility be captured. The database was built with the series of daily <b>closing</b> <b>stock</b> market <b>indices</b> in the United States (SP 500), United Kingdom (FTSE 100), Brazil (IBOVESPA) and South Korea (KOSPI) for the period from 02 / 01 / 2003 to 09 / 20 / 2012. Throughout the work the methodology was compared with others most widespread in the literature, and the model RSDC with two regimes was de ned as the most appropriate for the selected sample. The set of results provide evidence for the existence of nancial contagion between markets of the four countries considering the de nition of nancial contagion from the World Bank called very restrictive.

Different activation functions and different data preprocessing techniques were tested in order to dynamically determine the best neural network topology. We explored more than six hundred network structures for each neural network in our experiments. The same data sets were also analyzed by statistical models using a commercial statistics package.

This study focuses on the index-futures lead-laq and price-volume causality in the Malaysian <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures market. This research is also intended to examine the seasonal effects in the Malaysian <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures market. This study was undertaken using the daily data for closing price for both <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> and <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures and also the daily data for trading volume for <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures in Malaysia. The data, which covered the period of December 15, 1995 till June 30, 2001, was divided into three subperiods in view of variation in activity largely due to the Asian financial crisis. The aims of this study are: i) to determine whether there is any significant lead-laq relatuionship in terms of price index between the futures market and the stock market in Malaysia; ii) to determine the causal relationship between price index and trading volume in the Malaysian <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures market; and iii) determine whether there is any evidence of significant seasonal effects on <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures market returns and trading volume. The findings generally indicated thet the <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures returns leads the <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> returns by one day during the learning period and the stable period. However the <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures returns led the <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> returns by two days during the high volatility peruiod. This means that during high volatility period, the lead from <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures was greater than during the other subperiods. The study also found the existence of a contemporaneous relationship between the <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> returns and the <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures returns in the Malaysian spot and financial futures markets. Evidence also indicated that the two markets are highly cointegrated. In relation to the price-volume causality, the study found the existence of unidirectional causality running from volume to returns in the futures market during the learning period and bidirectional causality during the high volatility period. However {{there was no evidence of}} causality during the stable period. The study also found evidence pointing to the existence of day-of-week effect, week-of-month effect and month-of-year effect in the Malaysian <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures market.

Closed-form solutions are provided {{for both the}} term structure of nominal interest rates and the equilibrium value of the <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> where {{the value of the}} <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> is determined as the present value of future aggregate dividends. Preferences towards risk have crucial implications for the comovements of the <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> and bond yields since the degree of risk aversion determines whether the <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> is positively or negatively related to the real interest rate. As an application, the model is calibrated based on monthly data from the UK in the period from January 1979 to October 1996 in order to facilitate an analysis of what drives the movements of the term structure of nominal interest rates and what drives the (negative) correlation between the <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> and bond yields. ...|$|R

This paper mainly forecasts the daily <b>closing</b> price of <b>stock</b> markets. We propose a two-stage technique that combines the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) with nonparametric methods of local linear quantile (LLQ). We use the proposed technique, EMD-LLQ, to forecast two <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> time series. Detailed experiments are implemented for the proposedmethod, in which EMD-LPQ, EMD, andHolt-Wintermethods are compared. The proposed EMD-LPQmodel {{is determined to}} be superior to the EMD andHolt-Winter methods in predicting the <b>stock</b> <b>closing</b> prices. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the VaRs of daily stock market returns {{before and after}} the introduction of <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures contract trading in China from a statistical perspective. VaRs, in this paper, are estimated with peaks over threshold (POT) method fitting the tails of data distributions well. The key empirical results show that the VaRs of daily returns before <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures are greater than those after the <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures at the same significance levels. The market risk of Chinese stock market decreased after the introduction of <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures. </p...|$|R
40|$|We study return {{predictability}} of <b>stock</b> <b>indexes</b> of {{blue chip}} firms and smaller hightechnology firms in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom {{during the second}} half of the 1990 s. We measure return predictability in terms of first-order autocorrelation coefficients, and find evidence for return predictability of <b>stock</b> <b>indexes</b> of smaller hightechnology firms, but no evidence for return predictability of <b>stock</b> <b>indexes</b> of blue chip firms. Our findings suggest that a leading candidate for explaining the economic sources of return predictability of <b>stock</b> <b>indexes</b> of smaller high-technology firms is transaction costs...|$|R
50|$|<b>Stock</b> <b>index</b> futures {{are used}} for hedging, trading, and investments. Index futures are also used as leading {{indicators}} to determine market sentiment.Hedging using <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures could involve hedging against a portfolio of shares or equity <b>index</b> options.Trading using <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures could involve, for instance, volatility trading (The greater the volatility, the greater the likelihood of profit taking - usually taking relatively small but regular profits).Investing via the use of <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures could involve exposure to a market or sector without having to actually purchase shares directly.|$|R

40|$|China {{will launch}} the <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures {{in the later}} of 2007. This paper {{forecasts}} the impact of <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures on the volatility of the Chinese stock market based on the empirical test of Japan and Taiwan. The GARCH model {{will be used to}} examine on the effect of <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures on the volatility of the spot market. The forecasts will be made based on analysing the Japanese and Taiwanese stock market. However, the forecasts are suggestive not conclusive. The further studies are needed based on Chinese data. The importance of <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures on the Chinese stock market and the impact of SGX FTSE Xinhua A 50 <b>stock</b> <b>index</b> futures on the volatility of the Chinese stock market will also be discussed...|$|R
