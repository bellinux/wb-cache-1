2500|$|On September 3, 2007, {{the first}} section {{associated}} {{with the construction of}} the new East Span, the [...] temporary span connecting the main <b>cantilever</b> <b>section</b> to the Yerba Buena Island Tunnel, was put into service. Construction of the new connector span started in early 2007 alongside the existing span. Caltrans closed the Bay Bridge during the Labor Day weekend so crews could replace the old span. Once the old section was removed, the new span was rolled into place using a computer-guided system of hydraulic jacks and rollers. The new section was secured into place and the bridge re-opened 11 hours ahead of schedule, for the morning commute on September 4, 2007. In September 2009, during a single holiday closure, new temporary steelwork to route traffic around the location of the final approaches to the new bridge was put in place, and its connections to the tunnel exit and the existing bridge were completed, much as was done in September 2007. This bypass enabled the construction of the permanent transition structure between the double-deck tunnel exit and the new side-by-side bridge structure. Upon completion of the bridge, another extended closure allowed the removal of the temporary structure and the completion of the road link.|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} {{detecting}} and monitoring elastic strains in a semiconductor wafer (12) comprising {{the steps of}} coupling the wafer (12) to a transducer (10) having a periphery (11). This is followed by operating the transducer (10) to produce ultrasonic vibrations at a predetermined wavelength λ and propagating a standing wave through the wafer (12) {{in response to the}} ultrasonic vibrations. The method is characterized by extending the wafer (12) in a <b>cantilevered</b> <b>section</b> L from the periphery (11) of the transducer (10) to a distal end (13), and measuring the amplitude of the standing wave λ in the <b>cantilevered</b> <b>section</b> L. For maximum efficiency, the <b>cantilevered</b> <b>section</b> L is substantially one quarter of the predetermined wavelength (λ/ 4) ...|$|R
50|$|The central span of {{the current}} bridge is formed by two <b>cantilevered</b> <b>sections,</b> with the two {{approach}} spans acting as counterweights. This model represented the first use in reinforced concrete of a cantilevered and counterweight construction in either Britain or Ireland.|$|R
50|$|The {{footbridge}} {{was completed}} in November 1951, and built using balanced cantilever construction, with two <b>cantilever</b> <b>sections</b> and a central suspended span. The total central span is 150 ft. It was designed by L.G. Mouchel and Partners and built by Taylor Woodrow.|$|R
50|$|In the {{cantilever}} strutted version, {{shown in}} the illustration at left, the top strut (or struts, depending on design) can be fashioned into a cantilever truss. By all going to the same footing, {{the upper part of}} the deck girders are thus in tension and the moment of the <b>cantilever</b> <b>section</b> is offset by the moment of the water impinging on that section.|$|E
50|$|Demolition of the {{warehouses}} {{that lined}} the eastern, or inland, side of Furman Street began {{in the fall of}} 1946, and construction of a triple <b>cantilever</b> <b>section</b> followed for the next few years. The southern half of the Promenade was opened to the public on October 7, 1950, and the northern half on December 7, 1951 (the tenth anniversary of the World War II attack in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii). The highway itself was not ready for traffic until 1954.|$|E
50|$|With the {{construction}} of Brooklyn Bridge Park, the foreground view from the Promenade, which until the early 1980s had been of pre-container-era freighters docking at the piers below, and men unloading and loading them, takes on a different and more landscape-like look. Hopes for a major reconstruction of the well-worn triple <b>cantilever</b> <b>section</b> were disappointed in 2011 by the decision of NYSDOT that there was insufficient funding for more than spot repairs. Gentrification continues along the Promenade's route.|$|E
50|$|Contemporary {{buildings}} {{are designed to}} be noticed and to astonish. Some feature concrete structures wrapped in glass or aluminum screens, very asymmetric facades, and <b>cantilevered</b> <b>sections</b> which hang over the street. Skyscrapers twist, or break into crystal-like facets. Facades are designed to shimmer or change color at different times of day.|$|R
50|$|The Marine Boss crane barge, {{built for}} the heavy girder lifts during the {{construction}} of the 1967 San Mateo Bridge, erected a permanent 370 ST replacement span (which included a 36 ft <b>cantilevered</b> <b>section</b> to replace damage in the adjacent truss span) in June 1967 and removed both the wreckage from the original bridge and the temporary span at the same time.|$|R
5000|$|ACT {{was based}} around a rubber-wheeled car that Ford {{referred}} to as a [...] "horizontal elevator". The vehicles rode in a U-shaped guideway of prestressed concrete. The guideway was about 12 feet wide and normally built in 60 foot <b>cantilevered</b> <b>sections.</b> The vehicles themselves were just less than 7 feet wide, 9 feet high and 25 feet long, and weighed 13,800 pounds.|$|R
50|$|Work {{started on}} what was then called the Coos Bay Bridge on July 10, 1934. Glenn S. Paxson, Acting State Bridge Engineer while McCullough took {{a leave of absence}} to work on {{projects}} in Central America, was the supervising engineer during construction. The resident engineer was Raymond Archibald until 1935, when he joined McCullough, then Dexter R. Smith. The Northwest Roads Company of Portland, Oregon built the piers and the concrete structure. The steel sections of the bridge were built by the Virginia Bridge and Iron Company. The main piers are supported on piles driven into the bay's bed. The main towers of the <b>cantilever</b> <b>section</b> were fabricated off-site and moved to the bridge site in four sections. Work on the cantilever arms moved out in both directions from the tower, with the shoreward arm keeping slightly ahead of the center arm so that it would rest on a temporary support structure to stabilize the bridge. The concrete arch sections were erected using timber falsework. The bridge opened in June 1936.|$|E
50|$|On September 3, 2007, {{the first}} section {{associated}} {{with the construction of}} the new East Span, the 300 ft temporary span connecting the main <b>cantilever</b> <b>section</b> to the Yerba Buena Island Tunnel, was put into service.

50|$|The {{accepted}} {{structure was}} designed on the cantilever principle {{to cross the}} river and its flats, a length of 2,424 feet, with fourteen spans; thirteen were to be 176 feet and one of 136 feet. It was stated {{that one of the}} advantages was that the movement caused by temperature variations would not impact on the appearance or function of the sewer, which would have a grade of 1 in 2,500, when compared to steel construction. The cantilevers were to be splayed, to take account of horizontal wind stresses. The pre-cast concrete pipes (ovoid to achieve maximum hydraulic efficiency), in 8 foot lengths, were to be built into the structure. Trial bores along the site of the aqueduct showed that rock existed from 5-40 feet below the surface. However, reinforced concrete piles were to be used to support the bases of the piers. The reinforcement throughout was to be of ordinary commercial steel rods, which were lapped rather than joined into continuous bars. The steel rods in the upper booms of the cantilevers were arranged in concentric rings around the longitudinal rods. The gaps between each <b>cantilever</b> <b>section</b> were to be spanned by a 40-foot girder section fixed at one end, but free to move at the other. An expansion joint was to be provided at each span, its design being similar to that of an ordinary ‘stuffing box’. A footpath, acting as a structural form, would be provided throughout the whole length of the structure. At the time of its completion it would be considered one of the finest concrete structures in Australia (Stone, 1920: 49-51).|$|E
50|$|The Tower Bridge {{replaced}} the 1911 M Street Bridge in Sacramento, which was originally a swing through-truss railroad bridge. Later, 9 ft roadway sections were added as <b>cantilevered</b> <b>sections</b> {{on both sides}} of the existing rail bridge. Sacramento's population more than doubled between 1910 and 1935, rendering the existing bridge inadequate to handle heavy traffic. In 1933, the city realized that it needed a better crossing over the Sacramento River in case of war.|$|R
5|$|All {{versions}} of the Su-25 have a metal cantilever wing, of moderate sweep, high aspect ratio and equipped with high-lift devices. The wing consists of two <b>cantilever</b> <b>sections</b> attached to a central torsion box, forming a single unit with the fuselage. The air brakes are housed in fairings {{at the tip of}} each wing. Each wing has five hardpoints for weapons carriage, with the attachment points mounted on load-bearing ribs and spars. Each wing also features a five-section leading edge slat, a two-section flap and an aileron.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{redevelopment}} is a tower called One Central Park, a 117 m residential tower designed by Jean Nouvel featuring [...] "vertical gardens" [...] by Patrick Blanc and LED art by Yann Kersalé. Located opposite the UTS Tower, One Central Park is an apartment complex with a shopping centre called Central located on the lower levels. The design includes a <b>cantilevered</b> <b>section</b> including a heliostat to provide light to the parkland below. It is the tallest building on the site. Construction by Watpac Construction was completed in October 2013.|$|R
40|$|The {{alignment}} of single mode optical fibres using thermally actuated cantilever platforms is investigated. These devices F {{depend on their}} operation on differential thermal expansion of materials. An analysis and modeling of these thermal microactuators for fibre alignment purposes is discussed. The simulation results of microactuator deflection and the 4 coupling losses of single mode fibres by using the designed Pi-Shape microactuator are presented. By setting {{the length of the}} beam to 3 mm and the length of the deflecting <b>cantilever</b> <b>section</b> to 2 mm, the fibre-to-fibre coupling loss is only 0. 315 dB...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{technique}} for {{the measurement of}} air flow velocity using an optical fiber sensor is reported. The sensor measures the deformation of a rubber cantilever beam when subjected to the stresses induced by drag forces {{in the presence of}} the airflow. Tests performed in a wind tunnel have indicated a sensitivity of 2 (mu) /(m/s). A qualitative model based on fiber mode propagation has been developed which allows the sensor to be characterized in terms of optical losses. A single 1 mm diameter polymer fiber is mounted on the rectangular section rubber <b>cantilever</b> (<b>section</b> 14 mm by 6 mm) and six grooves are etched into the fiber which extend into the core of the fiber. As the beam deviates the surface deforms (stretches or contracts) and the fiber is subjected to strain. As the strain is increased the grooves become wider and the amount of light transmitted through the fiber is reduced due to increased losses. The sensor described has all the advantages of optical fiber sensors including electrical noise immunity and intrinsic safety for use in hazardous environments. However, its simple construction, robustness, versatility for a number of different fluid applications, as well as relatively low cost make it attractive for use in a wide variety of measurement applications e. g. wind velocity measurement where airborne moisture or chemicals are present...|$|E

5000|$|After a [...] "Burn The Bridges" [...] run and {{a parade}} of 1929-era cars over the empty deck, {{demolition}} of the Grace Bridge began in August 2005. There had been a movement to try to sell the bridge or to {{place it on the}} National Register of Historic Places so that, after removal, it could be reassembled elsewhere, but most of the steel and concrete was either recycled or dropped into the ocean to start artificial fishing reefs. The demolition of the Grace Bridge took approximately 2 years and required closing the shipping lane for half a day as the main span was cut from the <b>cantilever</b> <b>sections</b> and lowered onto a barge below.|$|R

5000|$|The {{height of}} the towers is 73.6 m, and the height to the {{underside}} of the main girder truss above the road level is 49.97 m. The span between the centres of the towers is 196.56 m, and the clearance between the towers is quoted as being 180.44 m; however, including the <b>cantilevered</b> <b>sections,</b> the main girder truss gives the bridge an overall length of 236 m. The distance between the centres of the anchorage caissons is 471.06 m. Power to propel the transporter platform or gondola is provided by two [...] electric motors, which in turn drive a large winch, situated in an elevated winding house at the eastern end of the bridge. This winch is sufficient to drive the gondola through its 196.56 m total travel at a speed of 3 m/s,.|$|R

25|$|In 1886, the Manhattan Bridge Building Company was {{organized}} {{to finance the}} construction. Among the prominent backers was Henry Clay Frick, the coal tycoon and associate of Andrew Carnegie. The Union Bridge Company of Athens, Pennsylvania, which had completed the Michigan Central cantilever bridge at Niagara (see Niagara Cantilever Bridge), was subcontracted to build the Poughkeepsie Bridge. Dawson, Symmes and Usher were the foundation engineers, while John F. O'Rourke, P. P. Dickinson and Arthur B. Paine were the structural engineers. The bridge was designed by Charles Macdonald and Arthur B. Paine. As is typical for cantilever bridges, construction {{was carried out by}} constructing cribwork, masonry piers, towers, fixed truss sections on falsework, and finally <b>cantilever</b> <b>sections,</b> with the final cantilever interconnection (suspended) spans floated out or raised with falsework. The first train crossed the bridge on December 29, 1888, and it was formally opened for scheduled passenger service on January 1, 1889.|$|R
