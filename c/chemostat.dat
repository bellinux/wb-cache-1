5|$|After the war, Szilard {{switched}} to biology. He invented the <b>chemostat,</b> discovered feedback inhibition, and {{was involved in}} the first cloning of a human cell. He publicly sounded the alarm against the possible development of salted thermonuclear bombs, a new kind of nuclear weapon that might annihilate mankind. Diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1960, he underwent treatment using a cobalt-60 treatment that he had designed. He helped found the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where he became a resident fellow. Szilard founded Council for a Livable World in 1962 to deliver “the sweet voice of reason” about nuclear weapons to Congress, the White House, and the American public. He died in his sleep {{of a heart attack in}} 1964.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Szilard {{secured a}} {{research}} professorship at the University of Chicago {{that allowed him}} to dabble in biology and the social sciences. He teamed up with Aaron Novick, a chemist who had worked at the Metallurgical Laboratory during the war. The two men saw biology as a field that had not been explored as much as physics, and was ready for scientific breakthroughs. It was a field that Szilard had been working on in 1933 before he had become subsumed in the quest for a nuclear chain reaction. The duo made considerable advances. They invented the <b>chemostat,</b> a device for regulating the growth rate of the microorganisms in a bioreactor, and developed methods for measuring the growth rate of bacteria. They discovered feedback inhibition, an important factor in processes such as growth and metabolism. Szilard gave essential advice to Theodore Puck and Philip I. Marcus for their first cloning of a human cell in 1955.|$|E

To mimic physiological conditions, we treat this process as an open chemical network by assuming {{some of the}} polymer concentrations fixed (<b>chemostatting).</b> We show that three different long-time behaviors may ensue: equilibrium states, nonequilibrium steady states, and continuous growth states. We dynamically and thermodynamically characterize these states and emphasize the crucial role of conservation laws in identifying the <b>chemostatting</b> conditions inducing them.

25|$|The {{deposition}} of silica by diatoms may also {{prove to be}} of utility to nanotechnology. Diatom cells repeatedly and reliably manufacture valves of various shapes and sizes, potentially allowing diatoms to manufacture micro- or nano-scale structures which may be of use {{in a range of}} devices, including: optical systems; semiconductor nanolithography; and even vehicles for drug delivery. With an appropriate artificial selection procedure, diatoms that produce valves of particular shapes and sizes might be evolved for cultivation in <b>chemostat</b> cultures to mass-produce nanoscale components. It has also been proposed that diatoms {{could be used as a}} component of solar cells by substituting photosensitive titanium dioxide for the silicon dioxide that diatoms normally use to create their cell walls. Diatom biofuel producing solar panels have also been proposed.|$|E
25|$|The {{objective}} function {{is essentially a}} measure of how each component in the system contributes to the production of the desired product. The product itself depends on the purpose of the model, {{but one of the most}} common examples is the study of total biomass. A notable example of the success of FBA is the ability to accurately predict the growth rate of the prokaryote E. coli when cultured in different conditions. In this case, the metabolic system was optimized to maximize the biomass {{objective function}}. However this model can be used to optimize the production of any product, and is often used to determine the output level of some biotechnologically relevant product. The model itself can be experimentally verified by cultivating organisms using a <b>chemostat</b> or similar tools to ensure that nutrient concentrations are held constant. Measurements of the production of the desired objective can then be used to correct the model.|$|E
25|$|Bacterial {{responses}} are elicited {{depending on the}} predator and prey combinations because feeding mechanisms differ among the protists. Moreover, the grazing protists also produce the by-products, which directly lead to the morphological plasticity of prey bacteria. For example, the morphological phenotypes of Flectobacillus spp. were evaluated in the presence and absence of the flagellate grazer Orchromonas spp. in a laboratory that has environmental control within a <b>chemostat.</b> Without grazer and with adequate nutrient supply, the Flectobacillus spp. grew mainly in medium-sized rod (4-7 μm), remaining a typical 6.2 μm in length. With the predator, the Flectobacillus spp. size was altered to an average 18.6 μm and it is resistant to grazing. Interestingly, if the bacteria {{are exposed to the}} soluble by-products produced by grazing Orchromonas spp. and pass through a dialysis membrane, the bacterial length can increase to an average 11.4 μm. Filamentation occurs as a direct response to these effectors that are produced by the predator and there is a size preference for grazing that varies for each species of protist. The filamentous bacteria that are larger than 7 μm in length are generally inedible by marine protists. This morphological class is called grazing resistant. Thus, filamentation leads to the prevention of phagocytosis and killing by predator.|$|E
40|$|Bacteroides ruminicola B(1) 4, a {{predominant}} ruminal and cecal bacterium, {{was grown}} in batch and continuous cultures, and beta-glucosidase activity {{was measured by}} following the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl-beta-glucopyranoside. Specific activity was high when the bacterium was grown in batch cultures containing cellobiose, mannose, or lactose (greater than 286 U/g of protein). Activity was reduced approximately 90 % when the organism was grown on glucose, sucrose, fructose, maltose, or arabinose. The specific activity of cells fermenting glucose was initially low but increased as glucose was depleted. When glucose was added to cultures growing on cellobiose, beta-glucosidase synthesis ceased immediately. Catabolite repression by glucose was not accompanied by diauxic growth and was not relieved by cyclic AMP. Since glucose-grown cultures eventually exhibited high beta-glucosidase activity, cellobiose was not needed as an inducer. Catabolite repression explained beta-glucosidase activity of batch cultures and high-dilution-rate <b>chemostats</b> where glucose accumulated, but it could not account for activity at slow dilution rates. Maximal beta-glucosidase activity was observed at a dilution rate of approximately 0. 35 h- 1, and cellobiose-limited <b>chemostats</b> showed a 15 -fold decrease in activity as the dilution rate declined. An eightfold decline was observed in glucose-limited <b>chemostats.</b> Since inducer availability was not a confounding factor in glucose-limited <b>chemostats,</b> the growth rate-dependent derepression could not be explained by other mechanisms...|$|R

[...] Moreover, the δD value of C16 fatty acid in an algal species named A. E. unicocca at 25°C was determined using the empirical equation y = 0.890x - 91.730 where x is the δD {{of water at}} harvest. For another algal species named B.

5000|$|A {{turbidostat}} is {{a continuous}} microbiological culture device, {{similar to a}} <b>chemostat</b> or an auxostat, which has feedback between the turbidity of the culture vessel and the dilution rate. [...] The theoretical relationship between growth in a <b>chemostat</b> and growth in a turbidostat is somewhat complex, {{in part because they}} are similar. A <b>chemostat</b> has a fixed volume and flow rate, and thus a fixed dilution rate. A turbidostat dynamically adjusts the flow rate (and therefore the dilution rate) to make the turbidity constant. At equilibrium, operation of both the <b>chemostat</b> and turbidostat are identical. It is only when classical <b>chemostat</b> assumptions are violated (for instance, out of equilibrium; or the cells are mutating) that a turbidostat is functionally different. One case may be while cells are growing at their maximum growth rate, in which case it is difficult to set a <b>chemostat</b> to the appropriate constant dilution rate.|$|E

If mixed populations are grown by serial dilution under conditions in which growth is not limited, both the lysogen and nonlysogen manifest identical growth rates. The increased fitness of the lysogens in glucose-limited <b>chemostats</b> correlates with a higher metabolic activity of the lysogen {{as compared with the}} nonlysogen during glucose exhaustion.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} metabolic {{interactions and}} the importance of specific structural relationships in a benzyl alcohol-degrading microbial consortium comprising two species, Pseudomonas putida strain R 1 and Acineto-bacter strain C 6, both of which are able to utilize benzyl alcohol as their sole carbon and energy source. The organisms were grown either as surface-attached organisms (biofilms) in flow chambers or as suspended cultures in <b>chemostats.</b> The numbers of CFU of P. putida R 1 and Acinetobacter strain C 6 were determined in <b>chemostats</b> and from the effluents of the flow chambers. When the two species were grown together in <b>chemostats</b> with limiting concentrations of benzyl alcohol, Acinetobacter strain C 6 outnumbered P. putida R 1 (500 : 1), whereas under similar growth conditions in biofilms, P. putida R 1 was present in higher numbers than Acinetobacter strain C 6 (5 : 1). In order to explain this difference, investigations of microbial activities and structural relationships were carried out in the biofilms.

40|$|The growth {{characteristics}} of five octopine-catabolizing pseudomonads have been determined in batch and continuous cultures. All five strains belonged to rRNA homology group I and showed a more psychrotrophic growth pattern than did Agrobacterium tumefaciens B 6 and ATCC 15955. In <b>chemostats</b> limited by octopine, either {{as the source}} of carbon and nitrogen or the sole source of nitrogen, maximum specific growth rates and substrate affinities were lower than those in <b>chemostats</b> limited by glutamate. These growth dynamics were similar to those observed for Agrobacterium strains B 6 and ATCC 15955 even though the catabolic genes and pathways are believed to be different in the two genera. An analysis of the yields in octopine-limited <b>chemostats</b> indicated that the use of octopine as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen was grossly inefficient. Octopine and presumably lysopine and octopinic acid provided a better source of nitrogen than of carbon. One of the Pseudomonas fluorescens strains, E 175 D, was able to produce its highest yield on octopine as a nitrogen source. Competition models formulated on pure culture parameters indicated that two of the Pseudomonas spp. would dominate A. tumefaciens B 6 and ATCC 15955 when in simple competition for octopine as a limiting substrate...|$|R

40|$|Acetate {{conversion}} pathways of methanogenic consortia in acetate-fed <b>chemostats</b> at dilution {{rates of}} 0. 025 and 0. 6 day 1 were investigated by using 13 C-labeled acetates, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrom-etry (GC-MS) {{analysis of the}} CH 4 and CO 2 produced. Nonaceticlastic syntrophic oxidation by acetate-oxidizing syntrophs and hydrogenotrophic methanogens was suggested to occupy a primary pathway (approximately 62 to 90 %) in total methanogenesis at the low dilution rate. In contrast, aceticlastic cleavage of acetate by aceti-clastic methanogens was suggested to occupy a primary pathway (approximately 95 to 99 %) in total metha-nogenesis at the high dilution rate. Phylogenetic analyses of transcripts of the methyl coenzyme M reductase gene (mcrA) confirmed {{that a significant number}} of transcripts of the genera Methanoculleus (hydrogenotrophic methanogens) and Methanosarcina (aceticlastic methanogens) were present in the <b>chemostats</b> at the low and high dilution rates, respectively. The mcrA transcripts of the genus Methanosaeta (aceticlastic methanogens), which dominated the population in a previous study (T. Shigematsu, Y. Tang, H. Kawaguchi, K. Ninomiya, J. Kijima, T. Kobayashi, S. Morimura, and K. Kida, J. Biosci. Bioeng. 96 : 547 - 558, 2003), were poorly detected at both dilution rates due to the limited coverage of the primers used.

40|$|The {{level of}} LamB protein {{in the outer}} {{membrane}} of Escherichia coli was derepressed {{in the absence of}} a known inducer (maltodextrins) under carbohydrate-limiting conditions in <b>chemostats.</b> LamB protein contrib-uted to the ability of the bacteria to remove sugar from glucose-limited <b>chemostats,</b> and well-characterized lamB mutants with reduced stability constants for glucose were less growth competitive under glucose limitation than those with wild-type affinity. In turn, wild-type bacteria were less growth competitive than lamB mutants with enhanced sugar affinity. In contrast to an earlier report, we found that LamB- bacteria were less able to compete in carbohydrate-limited <b>chemostats</b> (with glucose, lactose, arabinose, or glycerol as the carbon and energy sources) when mixed with LamB+ bacteria. The transport Km for [' 4 Clglucose was affected by the presence or affinity of LamB, but only in chemostat-grown bacteria, with their elevated LamB levels. The pattern of expression ofLamB and the advantage it confers for growth on low concentrations of carbohydrates are consistent with a wider role in sugar permeation than simply maltosaccharide transport, and hence the well-known maltoporin activity of LamB is but one facet of its role as the general glycoporin of E. coli. A corollary of these findings is that OmpF/OmpC porins, present at high levels in carbon-limited bacteria, do not provide sufficient permeability to sugars or even glycerol to support high growth rates at low concentrations. Hence, the sugar-binding site of LamB protein is an important contributor to the permeability of the oute...|$|R
40|$|Substrate {{supply and}} protist grazing {{are two of}} the most {{important}} forces that determine the composition and properties of bacterial assemblages. General ecological theory predicts that the relative importance of these factors is changing with the environmental productivity. In the present study, the interplay between bottom-up and top-down control was studied in a productivity gradient simulated in one-stage <b>chemostats</b> containing natural assemblages of freshwater bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates. Bacterial assemblages in the <b>chemostats</b> differed strongly with respect to their morphological, physiological and compositional properties in the presence versus the absence of predators. However, theses differences were modified by the productivity gradient. Whereas in predator-free <b>chemostats</b> the mean abundance and biomass of bacteria increased proportionally with increasing substrate supply, in treatments that included flagellates bacterial production was largely channelled into predator biomass. The bacterial morphological diversity increased along the productivity gradient with increasing substrate input but even more so with predators. Proportional to the increasing substrate supply, predation shifted the remaining bacteria towards morphologically inedible forms. Predation also caused shifts in bacterial substrate-utilization profiles, and in bacterial community composition, as analysed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of PCR-amplified 16 S-rRNA genes. Without predators, bacterial richness increased along the productivity gradient whereas with predators bacterial richness was higher at intermediate substrate levels. In accordance with ecological theory, these results demonstrated that predators influence all of the major characteristics of bacterial assemblages but the magnitude of this effect is modulated by the productivity of the system...|$|R

Aerobically and photoheterotrophically grown R. sphaeroides exhibited significantly different chemosensory response kinetics and cell-to-cell variability in their responses to 100 μM propionate. A greater proportion of the population of aerobically grown cells responded to a 100 μM step decrease in propionate; they adapted faster and showed less cell-to-cell variability than photosynthetic populations.

Every changestat always starts as {{a continuous}} cultivation experiment (<b>chemostat,</b> turbidostat), but after reaching steady state, smooth and slow change of an environmental parameter is applied. Two most common changestat techniqies are accelerostat (A-stat) and dilution rate stat (D-stat).In case of A-stat the changing environmental parameter is dilution rate (D, h−1) that causes the increase of specific growth rate (μ, h−1). When the acceleration of dilution (a) is chosen correctly then D = μ as in <b>chemostat.</b> The problem of choosing the correct acceleration of dilution has been studied with Escherichia coli and Lactococcus lactis resulting recommended range of 0.01-0.005 h−2.In D-stat dilution rate is always constant as in <b>chemostat,</b> but after reaching steady state environmental parameter other than dilution rate is changed. For instance temperature, pH or acetate concentration has been smoothly changed in bioreactor.Turbidostat type changestats are called Z-auxoaccelerostats (pH-auxoaccelerostat, CO2-auxoaccelerostat).
