In 1969, the Art Workers Coalition (AWC), a group of New York City artists who opposed the Vietnam War, in collaboration with Museum of Modern Art members Arthur Drexler and Elizabeth Shaw, created an iconic protest poster called And babies. The poster uses an image by photojournalist Ronald L. Haeberle and references the My Lai Massacre. The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) had promised to fund and circulate the poster, but after seeing the 2 by 3 foot poster MoMA pulled financing for the project at the last minute. MoMA's Board of Trustees included Nelson Rockefeller and William S. Paley (head of CBS), who reportedly [...] "hit the ceiling" [...] on seeing the proofs of the poster. The poster was included shortly thereafter in MoMA's Information exhibition of July 2 to September 20, 1970, curated by Kynaston McShine. Another famous <b>controversary</b> involved Pablo Picasso's painting Boy Leading a Horse, 1905–06, gifted to MoMA by William S. Paley in 1964. Ownership of Boy Leading a Horse was contested between the MoMA and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.|$|E

Their version was conducted in a similar musical style to its predecessor, but was considerably shorter {{in comparison to the}} original album version, with a run-time of two minutes and 40 seconds. The rendition was released in September 1968, reaching number 56 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was also included on Southwest F.O.B.'s only album, Smell of Incense.

The song {{has been the}} topic of <b>controversary</b> and fame for the band since its release. An altered version of the rag that was performed in live performances, known as [...] "The Fuck Cheer", subjugated Country Joe and the Fish to a television ban in 1968, for the vulgarity, but was applauded by concert-goers. In addition, the song was a favorite among the hippie culture, and was featured in McDonald's set list at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. Decades later, McDonald had a lawsuit filed against him for allegedly infringing on the copyright of Kid Ory's tune, [...] "Muskrat Ramble". McDonald denied these allegations and the suit was later dropped.|$|E

5000|$|Thanks to Carlos's {{marketing}} and scheduling, Peter Wheat and the Breadmen soon began opening for prominent music acts {{such as the}} Byrds, the Animals, and frequently were paired with Paul Revere & the Raiders. In March 1966, the band recorded [...] "Baby, What's New?" [...] and [...] "All the Time" [...] for their lone single, which was released on the Amber label and met with regional success. With all the good fortune the band was enjoying, they were scheduled to open for the Beatles' August 29, 1966 performance at Candlestick Park, however conflicts with labor unions limited the group to being spectators to the Fab Four's final live act. In September 1966, Birdwell and Kennedy were met with <b>controversary</b> when their school district refused enrollment by reasoning that their hair was too long. The opposition received brief national media attention until Birdwell and Kennedy conceded and trimmed their hair. In late 1966, Peter Wheat and the Breadmen, {{as a result of}} Carlos's encouragement and inspiration from the Beatles' song [...] "Got to Get You into My Life", added a horn section to their live act. However, the professionalism of the horn players clashed with the band's free-form instrumentals, and consequently caused the group's disbandment in early 1967.|$|E
5000|$|The band's live {{performances}} {{drew the attention}} of Chess Records in January 1967. The label, primarily known for releasing R&B material, signed the band {{in an effort to}} incorporate a new marketing opportunity. The band went to record their debut single in Ter Mer Studios, located in Chicago. The single, both conceived of original material by Borkenhagen, was produced by Ralph Bass. In June 1967, the band released their debut single, [...] "Mary Jane" [...] b/w [...] "Iowa, A Girl's Name", which was banned by locals radio stations within a week of the release for perceived pro-drug references. In reality, there were no pro-drug references and, ironically, the A-side, [...] "Mary Jane", was intended as an anti-drug statement. The <b>controversary</b> brought regional acclaim for the band, and they became known for their eccentric {{live performances}}. Following the banning of their single, the band released their only LP, The Baroques, which included the two songs from the single. The album became a regional hit, but the band was unable to branch out of state as their label was not well-known to distribute rock albums, let alone psychedelic rock. Still, the band was at its peak of popularity and was performing in an increased amount of gigs, but Chess Records dropped them from their label. One final self-financed effort was produced in 1968, but with the small marketing the single only reached regional acclaim. The band disbanded later that year.|$|E

40|$|The {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} {{an interpretation of}} the discourse of Belarusian national revival on the basis of textual production of the Prague emigration in the period between the two world wars. The period of time, when the process of national revival was set up in Belarus, goes down {{to the beginning of the}} 19 th century. The aim of the study is not to examine the separate phases of the moulding of Belarusian nationalism, but to find out their peculiarities and the causes which are responsible for them. The process of the rise of Belarusian national identity requires a new interpretation; therefore the whole discourse of it's formation should be taken in a profound way. The theoretical ground is the stratification of European national movements which was put forward by Miroslav Hroch. The <b>controversary</b> moment consists in the impossibility to place single phases of the Belarusian model of national revival in the Hroch's scheme. The slow start of national revival and numerous difficulties on it's way were caused by permanent oppression of the both of polish and Russian powers on the one hand and resistance to it from the side of Belarusian intellectuals. That's why the model of Belarusian revival is a unique combination characterised by diffusion of it's separate parts and temporal simultaneity of it's gradual [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Using random matrix {{techniques}} {{and the theory}} of Matrix Product States we show that reduced density matrices of quantum spin chains have generically maximum entropy. Jaynes ’ principle of maximum entropy [Jay 57 a, Jay 57 b] gives a pretty satisfactory solution to the old problem of dealing with prior information in probability theory. Generalizing the old principle of indifference of Laplace, it briefly states that among all possible probability distributions compatible with our prior information, the best choice is the one which maximizes the Shannon entropy. Apart from its important applications on decision theory, since its origin it has succeeded in giving a very useful information-theoretical view of statistical mechanics, both classical [Jay 57 a] and quantum [Jay 57 b]–where the function to maximize is the von-Neumann entropy. As an easy illustration, given the average energy of a quantum system as prior information, the density matrix which maximizes entropy is exactly the thermal state associated to that particular energy. This spirit has been recently recovered with great success in [PSW 06] and further developed {{in a number of}} ways in [BĆH+ 11, Cra 11, LPSW 09, LPSW 10]. To which extent the principle of maximum entropy can be extended to more and more general situations has been a very active and <b>controversary</b> field in the last half-century. For instance, very recently a series of theoretical and experimental works [CFM+ 08, FCM+ 08, TCF+ 11] seem to validate the principle i...|$|E
40|$|A {{parallel}} {{of elementary}} concepts but non-mathematically obtainable contrasts {{is described as}} entailed to all aspects of nature ubiquitously if conceptual pluralisms/dualisms are logically reduced to monisms. In order for active perceptual/conceptual science pursuit to exist with a valid and coherent meaning, conceptually organizable, but non-parametric sameness/equality of some sort must be attachable to all facets of all perspectives. Examples in lingual form are provided that employ the words “standard ” and conceptual comparisons are established with modern life and physical sciences. Discussion Dualism verses Monism It is generally agreed that a universal perspective does not exist (Nietzsche). As the scientist tries to construct, from witness, unified principles from a sea of particulars (Quine), his pursuit descends on problems of perspective. Accordingly, from a scientific perspective, truth not only needs to be extracted from theories of causation and consequences, is not obvious to the common sense as nature does not present to witness sufficient evidence for explanation; truth must also, yet at initial reflections cannot, speak of science itself, if a defined set of “scientifically relevant ” communicatable self knowledge has no members. The concepts of a universal perspective or a unified world theory imply a monism. Logically, if a universal perspective does not exist, if perspective exists at all, a pluralism is suggested. Currently, the physical sciences appear at a great and dividing <b>controversary</b> with respect to notions of singularity/pluraity, monism and dualism. In order to construe a unifying concept to nature, one construes a conceptual monism. Theoretically, though, definitions and concepts are extended to describe “out of this world” components of a universal theory, i. e. space time constructions derived from Einstein are divided into topics of special relativity and general relativity, time space theory predicts distinct areas of the universe inhabited by life. Yet, a theme {{in all of these}} scientific creations always parallel human perception of the world, and creativity. They are self subscribing, based upon their content for validity as nature itself also subscribes to itself in this same manner.

40|$|In {{the summer}} of 1996 on the {{fieldwork}} in the near-border area of Setumaa Pihkva oblast I collected all kinds of oral lore, but the dictophone also caught all kinds of information that was secondary {{from the point of}} view of legend and memorate texts, but that later while listening to and transcribing the tapes became more and more important. That information is laughter. I guess every religion researcher who has been to fieldwork has witnessed a situation where an informant, talking of some religious object or phenomenon, starts to laugh because of conflicting feelings even though there is nothing to laugh at. To understand the function of laughter in the given situation it is necessary to get rid of the rigid associations between laughter and jokes or at least admit the possibility that in every association laughter need not be caused by merry mood. The phenomenon has been treated in several ways. V. Propp has turned attention to the religious, ritual background of laughter. According to him, laughter has a different meaning in every context. Thus laughter was forbidden where the world of the dead crosses with ours. Propp suggests possible connections for that motif with the shamanistic conception of soultravelling. At the same time he gives an example of using laughter as a magical instrument (Propp 1976 : 178 - 192). Herbert Spencer has mentioned the connection of laughter with the <b>controversary,</b> but also with the degeneration of the phenomenon (Spencer 1939). The changing of every situation from big to small, from valued to nonvalued, form dangerous to safe may cause a relieving situation, a comical effect. If some important ethnicity carrying some value suddenly loses its characteristic feature, the situation may seem comical to the observer. He laughs and is happy to be above the situation (Knuuttila 1992 : 106 - 107). Listening to the fieldwork tapes it is noticeable how often informants burst out laughing while talking about mythological beings. This is often caused by the direct outslipping of this area from the sphere of reality. From the frightening and the mysterious has become just laughable in the process of demythologizing and degrading. Thus such laughter is often an indication of secularization, estrangement from the religious world view. It shows that authorities in the traditional culture are not valued anymore, that what might be the main permanent value that keeps the tradition alive and from losing its identity is honoured no longer. Changes paralysing the functioning mechanisms of enculturistation have taken place. The older generation cannot make the younger take over the traditional thinking and behaving formulas. It is quite usual that the story that was once told by the grandfather - and he heard it of course from his grandfather who heard it from his grandfather etc. - is not taken as an indisputable axiom but is confronted with all kinds of wisdom of this world. School education has made children wise and (grand) parents silly. Although the material used in the present text originates from Setumaa, I believe that the tendencies I tried to illustrate with this are characteristic to any changing culture looking for alternatives to the traditional world view...|$|E
40|$|The {{study is}} {{intended}} to address an important issue i. e. the problem of protection of civilians in non-international armed conflicts. The importance of the topic arises {{from the fact that}} today stability of international peace and security is a matter which is closely related to the effect of violence and atrocities committed on wide scale in such conflicts. The question of protection of civilian victims is the main issue which may give such conflicts an international dimension and may open the door for international interference. The regime of protection adopted under humanitarian law applicable in noninternational armed conflicts i. e. common Article 3 of Geneva Convention IV 1949 and Additional Protocol II, has its own shortcomings and lacunae as a result of insistence of States to preserve sovereignty which rendered it weak. In addition, experiences of recent and present conflicts show that the law is exposed to various challenges today. In fact the number, nature and conduct of hostilities have all changed since adoption of such rules. Moreover, {{there are a number of}} obstacles to the general adoption of such regime. It is seen as a pretext for interference in the internal affairs of States and is a restriction to their sovereignty. All these resulted in serious humanitarian problems, which has a direct impact on civilians. This required efforts to be made to find solutions in other branches of international law with a view to strengthen weakness and render the regime more effective. The purpose of the study is to find solutions to some of the problems by approaching the issue of protection within the broader context of human rights law. The study approaches the issue basically from the stand point of the contemporary international rules of the two bodies i. e. humanitarian law and human rights law. The reason being that protection under such bodies originates from one source of legal philosophy i. e. the respect of human dignity of persons in all circumstances. In view of this, the study shows how and to what extent human rights norms and their mechanisms influenced development of such rules and contributed to rendering the regime more effective. In this connection, the study discusses and examines different issues in relation to the subject matter while showing how State sovereignty and other factors place obstacles on the way of implementation of such rules in various forms. The finding of study has been applied to current Darfur armed conflict. The contribution of study is seen in attempting to highlight a legal framework of an international regime of protection within which both humanitarian and human rights norms may interact to provide solutions on current and emerging issues as far as protection of civilians in non-internal armed conflicts is concerned. The study contains ten chapters which discusses respectively: the theoretical relationship between human rights and humanitarian law and its impact on the notion of international protection of civilians in non-international armed conflicts; it traces the impact of human rights on the historical process of development of the law; examines the main specifities of the law; identifies areas of weaknesses by analyzing provisions of common Article 3 of Geneva Convention IV 1949 and Additional Protocol II 1977; it discusses the nature, extent and forms of contribution of human rights norms to various situations; discusses various issues in relation to implementation of the law on national level and the role of human rights mechanisms to ensure respect and implementation of such rules; discusses the question of legality of notion of “humanitarian intervention” justified on the protection of basic rights of civilians and <b>controversary</b> as to its lawfulness and related issues; it shows how the development of concept of individual criminal responsibility for crimes committed in such conflicts enhanced the system of protection and discusses the role of international tribunals and human rights norms in developing rules in this area. The study in applying the rules discussed, examines various legal aspects of Darfur conflict. The conclusion summarizes main findings of research, recommends a set of proposals and suggested reforms to render the international regime of protection of civilians in such conflicts more effective...|$|E
