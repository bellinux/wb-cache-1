5|$|By 1951, the {{laboratory}} had <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Teller-Ulam design, and thermonuclear {{tests were conducted}} during Operation Greenhouse. Tensions between Bradbury and Edward Teller over the degree of priority given to thermonuclear weapons development {{led to the creation}} of a second nuclear weapons laboratory, the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Berger later {{claimed that}} he had <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> idea of SS combat troops wearing {{camouflage}} jackets from his own hunting days, and had suggested it to SS-Obergruppenführer Sepp Dietrich, commander of the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler Regiment (LSSAH). From 1938, various forms of Flecktarn camouflage were issued. The author Adrian Weale doubts Berger's account.|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{from the}} Deep convened to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{design for the}} game, and Hall {{suggested}} a console-style platformer in the vein of Super Mario Bros., as they had the technology made for it; he further recommended a science fiction theme. John Carmack added {{the idea of a}} genius child protagonist saving the world, and Hall quickly created a short summary for the game: a dramatic introduction about eight-year-old genius Billy Blaze, defending the Earth with his spaceship. When he read out the summary in an over-dramatic voice to the group, they laughed and applauded, and the group agreed to begin work on Commander Keen in the Invasion of the Vorticons.|$|E

5|$|Known {{methods for}} {{repeatedly}} finding the closest pair of clusters in a dynamic set of clusters either require superlinear space {{to maintain a}} data structure that can find closest pairs quickly, or they take greater than linear time to find each closest pair. The nearest-neighbor chain algorithm uses a smaller {{amount of time and}} space than the greedy algorithm by merging pairs of clusters in a different order. In this way, it avoids the problem of repeatedly finding closest pairs. Nevertheless, for many types of clustering problem, it can be guaranteed to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same hierarchical clustering as the greedy algorithm despite the different merge order.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{takes place}} in January 1967. Pete asks Joan to make a {{personal}} and moral sacrifice to ensure the company lands the Jaguar account. Meanwhile, the creatives work long nights to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> perfect pitch for the presentation. Don becomes furious after learning of the impact Megan's new profession will have on their life. Feeling unappreciated, Peggy has lunch with Freddy Rumsen, who encourages her to make a move. Later, Peggy meets with Ted Chaough, from rival firm CGC, and accepts an offer for chief copywriter at CGC.|$|E
5|$|The filmmakers' trip to Norway {{provided}} essential {{knowledge for}} the animators to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> design aesthetic {{for the film}} in terms of color, light, and atmosphere. According to Giaimo, there were three important factors that they had acquired from the Norway research trip: the fjords, which are the massive vertical rock formations, and serve as the setting for the secluded kingdom of Arendelle; the medieval stave churches, whose rustic triangular rooflines and shingles inspired the castle compound; and the rosemaling folk art, whose distinctive paneling and grid patterns informed the architecture, decor, and costumes.|$|E
50|$|During CD's {{developing}} history, many {{technology was}} invented {{to improve the}} sound quality. Philips and Sony <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> new format CD, SACD, and JVC company sought to improve the sound quality during transmitting process and <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> XRCD. In 2004, JVC <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> new K2 Technology. Although the sound quality of JVC's XRCD is already superior comparing to normal format CD, K2 technology CD gave a more meticulous presentation and separation of instrument bodies.|$|R
5000|$|Tyler <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> main riff of [...] "Janie's Got a Gun" [...] using a low-tone {{setting on}} his keyboard. Hamilton then <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bassline. The guitars and drum parts were {{configured}} in later and Tyler wrote the lyrics. The guitar solo {{is played by}} Joe Perry and is accompanied by the main riff and rhythmic clapping.|$|R
5|$|Mark <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> music first, then I <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{words and}} we fitted it all {{together}} into a melody. That's the way I normally make songs– I write everything in the studio– and it obviously means that producers {{are very important to}} me. It's a complete joint effort.|$|R
5|$|Greg Glienna did not <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> surname Focker; Greg's {{character}} in the original film {{did not have a}} last name. The name was written into the script after Jim Carrey {{came up with the idea}} for the Focker surname during a creative session held before he abandoned the project. Once Meet the Parents was submitted for rating evaluation, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) questioned the surname Focker as possibly an expletive and, due to the repetitiveness of the surname throughout the film, the film was in danger of being rated R according to the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system. The filmmakers were asked if they had made up the name or if they can prove that such a name exists. The studio submitted to the MPAA a list of real people with the surname Focker which ensured that the film retained a PG-13 rating.|$|E
5|$|Steve, the host, {{presents}} {{the audience with}} a puzzle involving Blue, the animated dog... To help the audience unlock the puzzle, Blue leaves behind a series of clues, which are objects marked {{with one of her}} paw prints. In between the discovery of the clues, Steve plays a series of games — mini-puzzles — with the audience that are thematically related to the overall puzzle... As the show unfolds, Steve and Blue move from one animated set to another, jumping through magical doorways, leading viewers on a journey of discovery, until, {{at the end of the}} story, Steve returns to the living room. There, at the climax of the show, he sits down in a comfortable chair to think — a chair known, of course, in the literal world of Blue's Clues, as the Thinking Chair. He puzzles over Blue's three clues and attempts to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> answer.|$|E
5|$|The {{first story}} is about the opening of Shiva's third eye when he visits Madurai, {{the capital city of}} the Pandya Kingdom, ruled at that time by Shenbagapandian. Shenbagapandian wants to find the answer to a {{question}} posed by his wife— whether the fragrance from a woman's hair is natural or artificial— and announces a reward of 1000gold coins to anyone who can <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> answer. A poor poet named Dharumi desperately wants the reward and starts to break down in the Meenakshi Amman Temple. Shiva, hearing his cries, {{takes the form of a}} poet and gives Dharumi a poem containing the answer. Overjoyed, Dharumi takes the poem to Shenbagapandian's court and recites it, but Nakkeerar, the court's head poet, claims the poem's meaning is incorrect. On hearing this, Shiva argues with Nakkeerar about the poem's accuracy, burning him to ashes when he refuses to relent. Later, Shiva revives Nakkeerar, and says that he only wanted to test his knowledge. Nakkeerar asks the king to give the reward to Dharumi.|$|E

50|$|Green had {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} Howl of the Werewolf before the cancellation of the series by Puffin Books. Green <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> premise, {{the name of the}} book, the beginning of the story and the very end, along with a few background details at this earlier time, but <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> majority of the ideas in the book when he began plotting it in 2006.|$|R
5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro. Eshiro had <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> idea of a new adventure game about Ace Attorney characters while working on Trials and Tribulations, and Yamazaki had the idea to have it be about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation. The game was specifically designed {{to be different from}} previous Ace Attorney titles, with a larger focus on the environment. The development team had originally considered using Ema Skye, a character from earlier games in the series, as the lead character, but used Miles Edgeworth instead because of his popularity. They aimed to have players be immersed in the game and feel like they are Edgeworth, as opposed to previous Ace Attorney games, where they felt players merely could identify with the lead characters; to do this, they included direct control of Edgeworth, and a gameplay element that involves connecting his thoughts.|$|E
5|$|By August 1967, Baer and Harrison had {{completed}} a third prototype machine, but {{had found that}} to even come near to Baer's initial aim of a US$20 or $25 console would require {{so much to be}} excluded that the resulting console would not be very enjoyable. Baer additionally felt that he was not proving successful at designing fun games for the system; to make up for this he formally added Bill Rusch, who had helped him <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> initial games for the console, to the project. Though the pair found Rusch difficult to work with, he soon proved his value to the team by coming {{up with a way to}} display three spots on the screen at once rather than the previous two, and proposing the development of a ping pong game. By November the team, now on their fourth prototype machine, had a ping pong game, a chasing game, a light gun game, and three types of controllers: joysticks for the chase game, a rifle for the light gun game, and a three dial controller for the ping pong game. Campman felt that the system was advanced enough to begin trying to find a manufacturer to buy it; they had decided to aim for selling the rights to produce the console, as Sanders was not in the business of making and selling commercial electronics.|$|E
