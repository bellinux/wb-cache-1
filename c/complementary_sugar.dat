40|$|Viruses are {{powerful}} vectors for {{the delivery of}} nucleic acids, with applications in gene therapy and vaccination. However, major challenges for this technology include mis-targeting of the vector and neutralization by host antibody responses. Here we show that chemical addition of synthetic glycans to adenovirus (Ad) increased resistance to neutralizing antibodies and other critical host clearance mechanisms. Carbohydrate ligands were synthesised and functionalised with a cyanol methyl thiol group, which was subsequently activated to the amine reactive 2 -imino- 2 -methoxyethyl (IME). Ads were coated with ligand whilst maintaining virus cogency, with up to 58 % of total Ad lysine resides glycosylated. The viral tropism of glyco-Ads was switched to target macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), with high selectivity for the <b>complementary</b> <b>sugar</b> receptors. In vaccination studies, DC targeted glyco-virus enhanced antigen-specific T cell responses. Thus, chemical glycosylation of the Ad capsid allows modulation of tropism and shielding from sequestration and neutralizing antibodies. Since manipulation {{of this process is}} facile, it provides a flexible and potentially universal solution to key obstacles facing the utilization of viral vectors in therapeutic and vaccination contexts. </p...|$|E

Therefore, {{the availability of the}} national sugar should be maintained so as not to result in shortages and soaring prices of sugar in the market. The {{purpose of this study is}} to know how the trend offers sugar in Indonesia. how to effect the price of sugar, sugar substitute commodity prices, commodity prices <b>complementary</b> <b>sugar,</b> the production cost, yield and harvested area of national sugar offer. This method uses secondary data sources which are time series that started in 1998 - 2011 in the form of statistical data. The data is obtained from certain agencies related with this study is BPS and P 3 GI. To support this study, researchers also use documentation that collects data from a variety of media on line in addition from reference books and literature related to this study. To answer the purpose, the researchers used a trend analysis from year to year, multiple linear regression and Two-Stage Least Square (2 SLS) Trend offers sugar in Indonesia is always increase from year to year with a positive slope. There are still several other factors that could influence the alleged national sugar penawran the high cost of inputs, knowledge and technology and government policies. Things that need to be done to save the national sugar industry, among others to expand the area of land used to grow sugar cane. It aims to increase the yield of sugarcane produced by the farmers. It aims to increase the yield of sugarcane produced by the farmers. Additionally PG and farmers should work together to keep established cooperation that benefits both parties. Besides improving farmers' knowledge by way of counseling that can be provided by the PG or the government. For the government, is expected to provide a policy that benefits all parties including government, producers and consumers. Eg import policy, the government should be able to control the import of sugar in order to avoid dependency on imported sugar...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of dextran and fructose from carob pod extract (CPE) and cheese whey (CW) as carbon source by the bacterium Leuconostoc mesenteroides was investigated. The influence of secondary carbon sources (maltose, lactose and galactose) on dextran molecular weight and fermented broth viscosity were also studied. Significant changes were not observed in broth viscosity during dextran production at initial sucrose concentration of 20 and 120 g/l. <b>Complementary</b> <b>sugars</b> maltose, lactose and galactose together with sucrose promote {{production of}} dextran with fewer glucose units. Dextran molecular weight decreases from the range 1, 890, 000 – 10, 000, 000 to 240, 000 – 400, 000 Da when <b>complementary</b> <b>sugars</b> are present. Polydispersity was improved when <b>complementary</b> <b>sugars</b> were used. Fermentation using mixtures of carob pod extract and cheese whey confirm these results obtained for production of dextran. Final concentrations of dextran and fructose indicate that reaction yields were not affected. Carob pod and cheese whey can be successfully used {{as raw material}} in the fermentation system described. The maximum concentrations of dextran and fructose obtained using carob pod extract resulted in 8. 56 and 7. 78 g/l, respectively. Combined carob pod extract and cheese whey resulted in dextran and fructose concentrations of 7. 23 and 6. 98 g/l, respectively. The corresponding dextran mean molecular weight was 1, 653, 723 and 325, 829...|$|R
40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} (LAB) {{are generally}} regarded as safe (GRAS) microorganisms and widely used in industry and medicine. We are trying to add additional properties to them by gene engineering. However, the genetically modified bacteria are not acceptable to use in food and medicine due to the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in plasmids. Thus, it is necessary to develop food-grade selection markers. Food-grade markers can be divided into three classes based on their selected characteristics: dominant, <b>complementary</b> and <b>sugar</b> fermentation markers. The developments on these food-grade selection markers were reviewed in order to provide valuable references for the further study. [TAF Prev Med Bull 2012; 11 (4. 000) : 499 - 510...|$|R
40|$|Passiflora alata Curtis (sweet passion fruit) is {{a native}} species grown in South America, {{especially}} in Brazil. In addition to being aromatic, its pulp is sweeter and less acidic compared to traditional commercial passion fruits, and this makes it highly appreciated for fresh consumption. Its aroma is also very distinct from other passion fruit species {{but it has not}} been characterized so far. In the present study, for the first time, the volatile composition of sweet passion fruit was investigated. Two genotypes (BGM 004 and BGM 163) were evaluated and two SPME fibers were tested. Forty-five volatile compounds were properly identified and semiquantified. The carboxen-polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS) fiber presented better performance regarding both number and concentration of compounds. Esters and terpenes were the main volatile classes. Methyl butanoate, methyl (E) - 2 -butenoate, ethyl butanoate, ethyl (E) - 2 -butenoate, methyl 2 -hexenoate, and ethyl- 2 -hexenoate were among major compounds. As <b>complementary</b> results, <b>sugar</b> content, titratable acidity, pH, and total soluble solids were evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Most of our {{knowledge}} concerning the virulence determinants of pathogenic fungi comes from the infected host, mainly from animal models and more recently from in vitro studies with cell cultures. The fungi usually present intra- and/or extracellular host-parasite interfaces, with the parasitism phenomenon dependent on complementary surface molecules. Among living organisms, this has been characterized as a cohabitation event, where the fungus is able to recognize specific host tissues acting as an attractant, creating stable conditions for its survival. Several fungi pathogenic for humans and animals have evolved special strategies to deliver elements to their cellular targets that may be relevant to their pathogenicity. Most of these pathogens express surface factors that mediate binding to host cells either directly or indirectly, {{in the latter case}} binding to host adhesion components such as extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, which act as 'interlinking' molecules. The entry of the pathogen into the host cell is initiated by fungal adherence to the cell surface, which generates an uptake signal that may induce its cytoplasmic internalization. Once this is accomplished, some fungi are able to alter the host cytoskeletal architecture, as manifested by a rearrangement of microtubule and microfilament proteins, and this can also induce epithelial host cells to become apoptotic. It is possible that fungal pathogens induce modulation of different host cell pathways in order to evade host defences and to foster their own proliferation. For a number of pathogens, the ability to bind ECM glycoproteins, the capability of internalization and the induction of apoptosis are considered important factors in virulence. Furthermore, specific recognition between fungal parasites and their host cell targets may be mediated by the interaction of carbohydrate-binding proteins, e. g., lectins on the surface of one type of cell, probably a parasite, that combine with <b>complementary</b> <b>sugars</b> on the surface of host-cell. These interactions supply precise models to study putative adhesins and receptor-containing molecules {{in the context of the}} fungus-host interface. The recognition of the host molecules by fungi such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and Histoplasma capsulatum, and their molecular mechanisms of adhesion and invasion, are reviewed in this paper...|$|R
