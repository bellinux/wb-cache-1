Mohit Chauhan has lent his voice for nine songs and he is voice of character Jordan (played by Ranbir Kapoor). In 2010, during {{the development of the}} album, Rahman stated, [...] "Rockstar is a character driven film and as one can guess from the title, there will be lots of guitar". In 2010, several meetings of Ali and the lyricist brought into a phrase titled, [...] "Words destroy what I have to say". The song (Jo Bhi Main) that brings out the dilemma of the protagonist. Kamil suggested the last two lines (In lafzon ke maayne Kamil jaaney kaun badalta hai, main kehta hoon kuch, aur matlab aur koi ho jaata hai) for the particular song. But Ali didn’t accept the lines because the protagonist wasn’t supposed to have this level of sophistication as he was not poetic. To make it sound like something that could come from character Jordan, Kamil toned down the original after a few more rounds of discussion the lines were [...] "Jo Bhi Main Kehna Chaahoon Barbaad Kare Alfaaz Mere" [...] in the soundtrack. Upon development of the vociferating words Sadda Haq, Kamil stated that the situation needed a politically <b>charged</b> <b>number</b> that Jordan performs before a surging crowd {{at the height of his}} artistic angst. The slogan was used by students in during Kamil’s college days in Punjab to protest against the administration’s arbitrary announcement of exams. On writing lyrics of [...] "Phir Se Udd Chala", the analogies, he stated on introduction of offtrack lines like [...] "Banu Raavan, Jiyoon Mar Marke’ (I become Raavan by continuing to live each time I die), [...] "The line was a metaphor for character Jordan who like the demon Ravan from the mythology Ramayana, dies a number of times and yet goes on with his life and that is why I used the Ravan simile." [...] As per Rahman two songs Jo Bhi Mein and Sadda Haq aspire to be in the tradition of song Satisfaction by The Rolling Stones and song Another Brick in the Wall by Pink Floyd. Further, he added, [...] "Just like most rock songs stood for people's voices, here also the central character's cry relates to every one of us." [...] In an interview with Mid-Day, he stated, [...] "I consciously kept away from using distorted guitars and heavy snazzy music. But I have done it here in Rockstar. Plus most songs are acoustic." [...] For the song Katiya Karun singer Harshdeep Kaur noted that the song was recorded at AR Studios, Powai, Mumbai. Rahman asked the translation of Katiya Karun lyrics to which she explained the meaning to him. The lyrics translate as, [...] "I spin your cotton all night, the entire day is spent in this thought, I shall live and die for you, Be a spinning wheel O’ my body." [...] Rahman wanted it to be a very catchy number as it was going to be a fun song with Jordan and Heer (played by Nargis Fakhri) on the road. Rahman started composing and created the song right in front of the singer. Kaur stated that it wasn't a folk song, only the rhyme Katiya Karun belongs to a Punjabi folk content. A part of the song was shot at a discotheque and hence, Kamil put in subtle metaphor lyrics in the song lines translating, [...] "I will spin your cotton all night long" [...] that indirectly implied [...] "I will be at your services all night", thus giving it an item song touch.|$|E

The instrument was {{located at the}} site of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany at an altitude of 110 [*]m[*]a. s. l. and covered an area of 0. 5 [*]km 2. KASCADE-Grande consisted of several detector systems dedicated to measure different components of the EAS generated by the primary cosmic rays, i. e., the muon and the electron contents of the air-shower. With such a number of EAS observables and the precision of the measurements, the KASCADE-Grande data can be used to not only study in detail the properties of cosmic rays but also to test the predictions of hadronic-interaction models.

40|$|The neck {{dynamics}} in Fermi-energy heavy-ion collisions, {{to probe the}} nuclear symmetry energy {{in the domain of}} sub-saturation densities, is investigated within an isospin dependent transport model. The single and double ratios of neutron/proton from free nucleons and light clusters (complex particles) in the isotopic reactions are analyzed systematically. Isospin effects of particles produced from the neck fragmentations are explored, which are constrained within the midrapidities (|y/y_proj|< 0. 3) and azimuthal angles (70 ^o∼ 110 ^o, 250 ^o∼ 290 ^o) in semiperipheral nuclear collisions. It is found that the ratios of the energetic isospin particles strongly depend on the stiffness of nuclear symmetry energy and the effects increase with softening the symmetry energy, which would be a nice probe for extracting the symmetry energy below the normal density in experimentally. A flat structure appears at the tail spectra from the double ratio distributions. The neutron to proton ratio of light intermediate mass fragments (IMFs) with <b>charged</b> <b>number</b> Z≤ 8 is related to the density dependence of symmetry energy with less sensitivity in comparison to the isospin ratios of nucleons and light particles.

The results presented in this paper are part of a long-term study developed to evaluate user's satisfaction and adaptation to electric vehicle (EV), in terms of driving behavior, mobility, comfort, charging routines, interaction with the charging infrastructure. User's energy consumption and CO 2 emissions are also estimated. The data presented concerns information collected with interviews done to the eleven EV drivers and with on-board diaries, including km travelled, kWh <b>charged,</b> <b>number</b> of trips per day. The information was gathered over a period of 5 months, and comprises a total of 1772 trips, 18524 km travelled, a total electricity consumption of 3252 kWh related to approximately 220 charges. Results indicate that the adoption of the EV impacted everyday routines on 36 % of the participants and 73 % observed changes on their driving style. In comparison to conventional internal combustion engine vehicles running on gasoline or diesel, EV reveals considerable reductions in both energy consumption and CO 2 emissions in a Well-to-Wheel life cycle approach, with 1. 30 MJ/km and 63 g/km, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The KASCADE-Grande {{detector}} is an air-shower array {{devoted to}} the study of primary cosmic rays with very high-energies (E = 10 ^{ 16 } - 10 ^{ 18 } eV). The instrument is composed of different particle detector systems suitable for the detailed study of the properties of Extensive Air Showers (EAS) developed by cosmic rays in the atmosphere. Among the EAS observables studied with the detector, the <b>charged</b> <b>number</b> of particles, the muon content (at different energy thresholds), and the number of electrons are found. By comparing the measurements of these air-shower parameters with the expectations from MC simulations, different hadronic interaction models can be tested at the high-energy regime with the KASCADE-Grande experiment. In this work, the results of a study on the evolution of the muon content of EAS with zenith angle, performed with the KASCADE-Grande instrument, is presented. Measurements are compared with predictions from MC simulations based on the QGSJET II, QGSJET II- 04, SIBYLL 2. 1 and EPOS 1. 99 hadronic interaction models. A mismatch between experiment and simulations is observed. A similar problem is found for the evolution of the lateral distribution function of muons in the atmosphere.

40|$|International audienceWe {{develop a}} model for {{explaining}} the data of Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger) for Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR), in particular, the mass composition being steadily heavier with increasing energy from 3 EeV to 35 EeV. The model {{is based on the}} proton-dominated composition in the energy range (1 - 3) EeV observed in both Auger and HiRes experiments. Assuming extragalactic origin of this component, we argue that it must disappear at higher energies due to a low maximum energy of acceleration, ∼(4 - 10) EeV. Under an assumption of rigidity acceleration mechanism, the maximum acceleration energy for a nucleus with the <b>charged</b> <b>number</b> Z is, and the highest energy in the spectrum, reached by Iron, does not exceed (100 - 200) EeV. The growth of atomic weight with energy, observed in Auger, is provided by the rigidity mechanism of acceleration, since at each energy E= the contribution of nuclei with Z' < Z vanishes. The described model has disappointing consequences for future observations in UHECR: Since average energies per nucleon for all nuclei are less than (2 - 4) EeV, (i) pion photo-production on CMB photons in extragalactic space is absent; (ii) GZK cutoff in the spectrum does not exist; (iii) cosmogenic neutrinos produced on CMBR are absent; (iv) fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos produced on infrared - optical background radiation are too low for registration by existing detectors and projects. Due to nuclei deflection in galactic magnetic fields, the correlation with nearby sources is absent even at highest energies...|$|E
40|$|The {{starting}} point {{of this paper is}} that the collection costs of urban road pricing {{have turned out to be}} unexpectedly high. A comparative cost analysis of the congestion charging system of London, Stockholm, Oslo and Singapore also shows that there are large collection cost differences. The most striking difference is between Oslo and London. Oslo, like Stockholm has the necessary, natural, qualities for a central city toll ring with a limited number of entrances; just 18 and 19 tollgates are required. For large historic cities like London with hundreds of inlets to the central city, tollgates at every entrance would involve high investment costs and be very obtrusive in the street scene. The problem is, however, that the present London charging system, with no tollgates, shows high running costs, ten times higher than in Oslo, in spite of the fact that the <b>charged</b> <b>number</b> of vehicles is the same in the two cities. This is a formidable obstacle to alleviating urban traffic congestion in many big cities. The charging technology could hopefully be developed, however, another approach is to develop and combine other measures including traffic regulation, parking policy and public transport subsidisation, which would be only second-best in a hypothetical situation where road pricing is without costs. This paper focuses on parking policy. Two strands of parking policy reform are discussed; fringe benefit taxation of free workplace parking which has recently been introduced in Sweden and a two-part tariff at parking meters, which is suggested as an extension of congestion charging to all day traffic within the central city.
