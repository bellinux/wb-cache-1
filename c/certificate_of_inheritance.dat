40|$|Based on the Decision of the Constitutional Court Number 46 /PUU-VIII/ 2010, a {{child born}} from an {{unregistered}} marriage may have a civil relationship with his biological father, so as to remain inherited, and to obtain legal certainty as an heir {{the name of the}} uregistered marrieage born child should mentioned as the heir. This fact is interesting to be examined and it aims to obtain answers of the legal strength of the heirs’ certificate of unrecorded marriage. This research type is juridical normative with legislation approach through the descriptive-qualitative method. The results of the study indicate that in order to obtain legal certainty, it is supposedly that the <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> contains the name of the unrecorded marriage born child. But, this is can’t be done, because there is no legislation determines that the child’s name from unregistered marriage could be contained in the letter. So, with no legislation, the <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> containing the name of the unregistered marriage child has no legal power, and therefore it is recommended that the government immediately make a regulation concerning the inheritance certificate for the child from unregistered marriage, so it could be clear and fixed...|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of the materials in this collection {{is related to the}} estate of the industrialist Ludwig Cohn and the restitution claims made in relation to this estate after its confiscation by Nazi Germany and later by the German Democratic Republic. Series I consists primarily of correspondence, while Series II contains personal documents of family members and materials connected to the family history. Ludwig Philipp Cohn was an industrialist who ran a hosiery factory in Görlitz, Saxony (Germany), with his brother Fritz. The haberdashery had been founded in 1846, and developed into a large hosiery factoryby Ludwig’s uncle, Louis Cohn. Ludwig’s father Leopold had joined the company in 1865. Leopold {{was also one of the}} founders of the Jewish community in Görlitz. Ludwig Philipp died in the concentration camp Buchenwald in July 1938. Before his death, his daughters Hildegard Dorothea (Hilde, born 1909) and Susanne Bertha Stein (Susan, 1911 - 2000) had emigrated to the U. S. along with Susan’s husband, the physician Albrecht Stein (1905 - 1960). Ludwig’s widow Meta Cohn née Klinkowstein (1888 - 1968) followed them later. All three—Hilde, Susan, and Meta—disclaimed Ludwig’s inheritance out of political reasons and Susan’s newborn son Robert A. Stein (born in February 1939 in New York) became the only heir of Ludwig Cohn’s estate. The estate was partly sold under duress and partly expropriated without compensation by the German government in 1942 by declaring the <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> to Robert Stein invalid. Stocks, bank accounts and furniture which were under the administration of the lawyer Hans Schwidtal in Görlitz were gradually lost. Most of the furniture was destroyed in the war, the stocks lost their value and the bank accounts were devaluated. The real estate was expropriated by the German Democratic Republic in 1946. After 1945, Meta Cohn took up the procedure to claim legal succession. In 1956, the inheritance to Robert was withdrawn and granted to Meta Cohn and her daughters. Robert Stein challenged this in the 1960 s in order to claim compensation at the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission (FCSC). His <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> was renewed in 1967 by the court of Hildesheim and he received compensation for his grandfather’s estate in the 1980 s. In the context of a new claim against the GDR in the 1990 s, Robert’s <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> was withdrawn again by the court of Görlitz in 1993.

40|$|The bulk of {{material}} {{in this collection}} comprises legal correspondence documenting claims to the Bleichroeder heritage by {{various members of the}} family after World War II. Most of the correspondence pertains to research conducted by the creator of the collection and distant relative of the Bleichroeder family, Lew Franciszek de WR Chodkiewicz ChudzikiewiczCount L F herb. Chodkiewicz, on behalf of these individuals. Included are genealogical documents, testaments, restitution papers, birth and death certificates, juridical protocols, power <b>of</b> attorneys, <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>inheritance,</b> invoices, and several handwritten notes by Chudzikiewicz. Some translations are included. In addition to legal documents, the collection contains a few newspaper clippings and personal documents of the Bleichroeder family such as photographs, wedding telegrams or calling cards. The following individuals are mentioned in this collection:Bleichroeder von, Gerson (1822 - 1898); Bleichroeder von, James (1860 - 1937); Bleichroeder von, Hans (- 1917); Bleichroeder von, Georg (1854 - 1902); Bleichroeder von, Hans jr. (1886 - 1938); Bleichroeder von, Werner (- 1927); Bleichroeder von, Harriet (née Alexander), (1869 - 1946); Bleichroeder von, Curt (1889 - 1958); Bleichroeder von, Edgar (1897 -); Bleichroeder von, Ellie (1894 - 1989); Bleichroeder, Samuel (1779 - 1855); Bleichroeder, von, Wolfgang (1918 - 1984); Campe von, Harriet (née Bleichroeder) (1892 - 1942); Chudson, Lee Francis; Orska, von, Maria. The story of the Bleichroeder family is generally associated with the S. Bleichroeder bank and its political role in 19 th and early 20 th century Germany. Founded in 1803 in Berlin by Samuel Bleichroeder (1779 - 1855), the private bank gained significant political influence in Prussia in the mid- 19 th century under Bismarck, suffered a severe decline during the depression in the 1920 s and 1930 s and was annihilated in the process of Aryanization under Hitler. In 1938 the bank ceased to exist in Germany, and a new firm bearing the name Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder came to be established first in London and then in New York. Being scattered over Europe and the United States after the end of World War II, various members of the family fell into a dispute about the disposition of the Bleichroeder heritage, which, entangled with restitution claims, remained a difficult issue to resolve. Through close contacts to the Rothschild family, Gerson (von) Bleichroeder (1822 - 1898), eldest son of Samuel Bleichroeder, was introduced to Otto von Bismarck and became his banker and close consultant, both economically and diplomatically. With Bismarck’s rise to power in the 1860 s, the S. Bleichroeder bank assumed an increasingly significant role in Prussian politics, particularly through providing loans for Bismarck’s wars in Europe. In 1872 Gerson was ennobled. After Gerson’s death in 1898, his three sons, Georg (1854 - 1902), Hans (- 1917) and James (1860 - 1937) only played a marginal role in the bank as silent partners, while the core business was carried on by Julius von Schwabach and later by his son Paul von Schwabach. After a severe economic decline in the mid- 1920 s and a series of lawsuits, the Bleichroeder heirs were mostly eliminated from the family business. Hans von Bleichroeder had two children, Hans jr. von Bleichroeder (1886 - 1938) and Werner von Bleichroeder (- 1927). Hans’s brother, James von Bleichroeder, was married to Harriet von Bleichroeder (née Alexander) (1869 - 1946), with whom he had four children: Curt (1889 - 1958), Edgar (1897 -), Ellie (1894 - 1989) and Harriet von Campe (née Bleichroeder) (1892 - 1942). Wolfgang von Bleichroeder (1918 - 1984) is James von Bleichroeder’s son of his second marriage with Maria von Bleichroeder (née Seidt). Processeddigitize...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a semantic model <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> and investigates its {{applications for the}} analysis and design <b>of</b> programming languages. <b>Inheritance</b> is a mechanism for incremental programming {{in the presence of}} self-reference. This interpretation <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> is formalized using traditional techniques of fixed-point theory, resulting in a compositional model <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> that is directly applicable to object-oriented languages. Novel applications <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> revealed by the model are illustrated to show that inheritance has wider significance beyond object-oriented class inheritance. Constraints induced by self-reference and inheritance are investigated using type theory and yield a formal characterization of abstract classes and a demonstration that the subtype relation is a direct consequence of the basic mechanism <b>of</b> <b>inheritance.</b> The model is proven equivalent to the operational semantics <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> embodied by the interpreters of object-oriented languages like Smalltalk.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we use HMRC estate {{statistics}} and micro-data from four UK household surveys to examine {{changes in the}} size, the composition {{and the distribution of}} inherited wealth in the UK over the period 1985 - 2010. Our findings indicate that the period under examination is characterised by a substantial increase in the flow <b>of</b> <b>inheritance.</b> This increase, which was particularly marked in the early 2000 s, was mainly driven by the rise in house prices {{and to a lesser extent}} by the increase in the proportion <b>of</b> <b>inheritances</b> which included housing assets. The distribution <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> amongst recipients became more unequal over this period. However, the inequality-increasing effect from the greater dispersion in the distribution <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> was counterbalanced by the increase in the percentage of the population who received an inheritance, resulting in a small decrease in the inequality <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> for the population overall. Analysis of the distribution <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> by socio-economic status suggests a positive association between inheritance and socio-economic status with some suggestive evidence that this association might have strengthened over time.
