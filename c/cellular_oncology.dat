For many, ageing connotes unattractive changes in {{the appearance of the}} skin. The gross morphological changes of ageing skin are mirrored by a range of more profound age-associated physiological declines. Thus, skin ageing can be put into other perspectives which lie at the interfaces of molecular biology, <b>cellular</b> biology, <b>oncology</b> and cosmetic dermatology. Genetically programmed replicative senescence and stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) are two processes that are fundamental to skin ageing.

40|$|In {{the last}} twenty years, the field of {{cellular}} and molecular oncology has been born and has moved its first steps, with an increasingly rapid pace. Hundreds of oncogenic and oncosuppressive signaling cascades have been characterized, facilitating {{the development of an}} ever more refined and variegated arsenal of diagnostic and therapeutic weapons. Furthermore, several cancer-specific features and processes have been identified that constitute promising therapeutic targets. For instance, it has been demonstrated that microRNAs can {{play a critical role in}} oncogenesis and tumor suppression. Moreover, it turned out that tumor cells frequently exhibit an extensive metabolic rewiring, can behave in a stem cell-like fashion (and hence sustain tumor growth), often constitutively activate stress response pathways that allow them to survive, can react to therapy by engaging in non-apoptotic cell death programs, and sometimes die while eliciting a tumor-specific immune response.

Over the last decade, {{the management and}} prognosis of GISTs has changed dramatically with molecular characterization of the c-kit mutation and the adoption of targeted systemic therapy.

Inoperable or metastatic tumors are treated primarily with imatinib. Despite excellent initial response rates, resistance to targeted therapy has emerged as a common clinical problem, with relatively few therapeutic solutions. While the treatment of GISTs does not commonly include radiotherapy, radiation therapy could be a valuable contributing modality. Several case reports indicate that radiation can control locally progressive, drug-resistant disease.

The standard management of locoregionally advanced rectal cancer is neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (nCRT), followed by radical resection (low-anterior resection or abdominoperineal resection with total mesorectal excision). Approximately 15 % of patients {{can have a}} pathologic complete response (pCR) {{at the time of}} surgery, indicating that some patients can have no detectable residual disease after nCRT. The actual benefit of surgery in this group of patients is unclear. It is possible that omission of surgery in these patients, termed selective nonoperative management, can limit the toxicities associated with standard, multimodal combined modality therapy without compromising disease control. In this review, we discuss the clinical experiences to date using selective nonoperative management and various attempts at escalation of nCRT to improve the number of {{patients who}} have a pCR. We also explore several clinical, laboratory, imaging, histopathologic, and genetic biomarkers that have been tested as tools to predict which patients are most likely to have a pCR after nCRT.

40|$|Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{are known}} to play an {{important}} role in cancer development by post-transcriptionally affecting the expression of critical genes. The aims of this study were two-fold: (i) to develop a robust method to isolate miRNAs from small volumes of saliva and (ii) to develop a panel of saliva-based diagnostic biomarkers for the detection of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Methods Five differentially expressed miRNAs were selected from miScript™ miRNA microarray data generated using saliva from five HNSCC patients and five healthy controls. Their differential expression was subsequently confirmed by RT-qPCR using saliva samples from healthy controls (n = 56) and HNSCC patients (n = 56). These samples were divided into two different cohorts, i. e., a first confirmatory cohort (n = 21) and a second independent validation cohort (n = 35), to narrow down the miRNA diagnostic panel to three miRNAs: miR- 9, miR- 134 and miR- 191. This diagnostic panel was independently validated using HNSCC miRNA expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), encompassing 334 tumours and 39 adjacent normal tissues. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess the diagnostic capacity of the panel. Results On average 60 ng/μL miRNA was isolated from 200 μL of saliva. Overall a good correlation was observed between the microarray data and the RT-qPCR data. We found that miR- 9 (P < 0. 0001), miR- 134 (P < 0. 0001) and miR- 191 (P < 0. 001) were differentially expressed between saliva from HNSCC patients and healthy controls, and that these miRNAs provided a good discriminative capacity with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0. 85 (P < 0. 0001), 0. 74 (P < 0. 001) and 0. 98 (P < 0. 0001), respectively. In addition, we found that the salivary miRNA data showed a good correlation with the TCGA miRNA data, thereby providing an independent validation. Conclusions We show that we have developed a reliable method to isolate miRNAs from small volumes of saliva, and that the saliva-derived miRNAs miR- 9, miR- 134 and miR- 191 may serve as novel biomarkers to reliably detect HNSCC. © 2014 International Society for <b>Cellular</b> <b>Oncology...</b>|$|E

Several gene transcription factors regulate EMT, including Snail 1, Snail 2, Zeb 1, Zeb 2, and Twist; ongoing studies continue to identify and elucidate other drivers. Specific micro ribonucleic acids (RNAs) have also been found to regulate EMT, including the microRNA- 200 (miR- 200) family, which targets Zeb 1 /Zeb 2. Cancer “stem cells” – with the ability to self-renew and to regenerate all the cell types within the tumor – have been found to express EMT markers, further implicating both cancer stem cells and EMT with metastasis. Microenvironmental cues, including transforming growth factor-β, can direct EMT tumor metastasis, such as by regulating miR- 200 expression. In human tumors, EMT markers and regulators may be expressed in a subset of tumor cells, such as in cells at the invasive front or tumor–microenvironment interface, though certain subtypes of cancer can show widespread mesenchymal-like features. In terms of therapeutic targeting of EMT in patients, potential areas of exploration could include targeting the cancer stem cell subpopulation, as well as microRNA-based therapeutics that reintroduce miR- 200. This review will examine evidence for a role of EMT in invasion and metastasis, with the focus being on studies in lung and breast cancers. We also carry out analyses of publicly-available gene expression profiling datasets in order to show how EMT-associated genes appear coordinately expressed across human tumor specimens.

40|$|In the {{chemical}} composition {{of olive oil}} (Olea europaea L.) it is emphasized the massive presence of oleic acid (over 70 %), monounsaturated fatty acid {{part of the family}} of omega 9, a 7 - 8 % linoleic acid (omega 6) and a small presence (0. 5 - 1 %) of linolenic acid (omega 3). For its high content of monounsaturated fatty acids, olive oil is the most stable and therefore the most suitable for heating, compared to oils with a dominance of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Interest in vitamin E has increased in recent years, thanks to its high antioxidant power and its role against related diseases with age-related, visual, dermatological, cardiovascular disorders Alzheimer’s disease and more. Vegetable oils are a major source of vitamin E through diet (Sayago et al., 2007), especially with the variety of olives “Hojiblanca”. Thanks to unsaturated fatty acids cell oxidation can be prevented: this helps prevent many illness, and even premature aging. So far, the advantages acknowledged to olive oil are those of lowering cholesterol, preventing cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Among the most recent researches it is important to distinguish the studies carried out on their contribution to the prevention and treatment of breast cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. Researchers found that in addition to the benefi ts that give monounsaturated fats, in extra virgin olive oil, there is a substance called “oleocanthal”, which helps protect nerve cells damaged in Alzheimer’s disease. The importance of this discovery is enormous when one considers that only Alzheimer’s disease affects 30 million people around the world, with a different distribution {{depending on the type of}} oil in the diet (Olguín Cordero, 2012). The latest research endorses that oleocanthal works by destroying cancer cells without affecting the healthy ones, as it is stated in the Molecular and <b>Cellular</b> <b>Oncology</b> Journal. Studies carried out in different Spanish universities have concluded that thanks to the antioxidant power of olive oil, a disease such as Alzheimer can be prevented. In conclusion, we can say that the Mediterranean diet rich in extra virgin olive oil greatly infl uences on human health, reducing, delaying or even eliminating several diseases...|$|E

Abstract: Exenatide is an {{incretin}} mimetic that is recently {{available in}} the US {{for the treatment of}} diabetes. There is a paucity of information on the effects of exenatide in glucocorticoid (GC) -induced diabetes. Although the effect of continuous intravenous infusion of exenatide on GC-induced glucose intolerance has been investigated before in healthy human males receiving oral prednisolone, we investigated the efficacy of a single subcutaneous dose of exenatide (3 &micro;g/kg) in lowering blood glucose in GC-induced glucose intolerance in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. In a longitudinal experiment, the area under the curve (AUC) of oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) significantly increased after dexamethasone (P = 0. 004), which was subsequently decreased by exenatide (P &lt; 0. 001). A cross-sectional experiment showed that exenatide improved glucose tolerance compared with placebo in a mouse model of dexamethasone-induced glucose intolerance. AUC of OGTT in the exenatide group were significantly (P &lt; 0. 001) lower than in the placebo group. Insulin tolerance tests (ITT) demonstrated that exenatide decreased the ability of the mice to tolerate insulin compared with placebo. The AUC of ITT in the exenatide group were also significantly (P = 0. 006) lower than in the placebo group. In conclusion, a single dose of exenatide was able to decrease glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in these placebo-controlled experiments. Future clinical trials are justified to investigate the role of exenatide in the treatment of GC-induced glucose intolerance/diabetes.
