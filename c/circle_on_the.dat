5|$|In {{the final}} {{months of the}} war, Hand {{increasingly}} supported President Woodrow Wilson's post-war foreign policy objectives. He believed the United States should endorse the League of Nations and the Treaty of Versailles, despite their flaws. This position estranged him from Croly and others at The New Republic, who vehemently rejected both. Alienated from his old <b>circle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> magazine and by the reactionary and isolationist mood of the country, Hand found himself politically homeless.|$|E
5|$|A 19th-century ethnographic account {{from eastern}} Herzegovina {{describes}} a way through {{which a man}} who was not born as a zduhać could become one. Forty days after he ceased praying to God and washing his face, the man should go to some level ground, before he drew a <b>circle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground and sat in its centre. Soon the Devil would come and ask the man whether he was willing to join his army, and what form he wanted to be transformed into. When the man stated the desired form, the Devil would turn him into that, making him a zduhać. In the region of Semberija, northeast Bosnia, а zduhać could pass his supernatural power on to his son.|$|E
5|$|Burst {{time offset}} (BTO) – the time {{difference}} between when a signal is sent from the ground station and when the response is received. This measure is proportional to twice {{the distance from the}} ground station via the satellite to the aircraft and includes the time that the SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station. This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft. As a result, one can define a <b>circle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Earth's surface the points on whose circumference are equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance, and in turn this circle can be reduced to arcs by eliminating parts of the circle that are outside the aircraft's range.|$|E

5|$|A Very Gaga Thanksgiving {{initially}} {{aired on}} November 24, 2011 in the United States on ABC. It attained 5.749 million viewers and garnered a 1.8/5 rating in the 18–49 demographic {{in its first}} hour. Gaga's special aired simultaneously with the reruns of The Simpsons on FOX, Person of Interest on CBS, and The Secret <b>Circle</b> <b>on</b> <b>The</b> CW. In its second hour, total viewership and ratings slightly declined to 5.388 million viewers and a 1.6/5 ratings in the 18–49 demographic, despite airing simultaneously with a recap of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on NBC and a rerun of The Mentalist on CBS. A Very Gaga Thanksgiving failed to beat other Thanksgiving specials in the ratings, including A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving. A Very Gaga Thanksgiving had the highest rating in the 18–49 demographic in its time slot, and total viewership increased by 23% (1.3 million viewers) from its predecessor, singer Beyoncé's 2009 concert, I Am... World Tour. It subsequently gave ABC its best ratings in four years for its respective time slot on Thanksgiving Day.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, {{construction}} {{began on}} the Keeler Street Expressway, a limited-access highway extending across Irondequoit from the Genesee River (at the Veterans Memorial Bridge) to the Sea Breeze Expressway. The first section from North Goodman Street to the Sea Breeze Expressway was completed by 1968 while the remainder opened in late 1969. The name of the expressway was derived from Keeler Street, a small residential street that originally connected to East Ridge Road and St. Paul Street {{by way of a}} traffic <b>circle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east bank of the Genesee River. The street was turned into a dead-end street {{as a result of the}} expressway's construction. US104 was moved from East Ridge Road to the expressway, which remains known, albeit infrequently, as the Keeler Street Expressway to this day. NY18 remained on East Ridge Road, however, reducing the overlap between US104 and NY18 to just the portion on the Veterans Bridge. NY18 was truncated to its current eastern terminus , eliminating the overlap entirely.|$|E
5|$|Scotland Yard issued another {{appeal in}} March 2014 for {{information}} {{about a man who}} had entered holiday homes occupied by British families in four incidents in the western Algarve between 2004 and 2006, two of them in Praia da Luz. On those occasions he sexually assaulted five white girls, aged 7–10, in their beds. The man spoke English with a foreign accent and his speech was slow and perhaps slurred. He had short, dark, unkempt hair, tanned skin, and in the view of three victims a distinctive smell; he may have worn a long-sleeved burgundy top, perhaps with a white <b>circle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back. These were among 12 incidents in the area between 2004 and 2010. The Polícia Judiciária reportedly believed the intruder in the four incidents between 2004 and 2006 was Euclides Monteiro, the former Ocean Club employee from Cape Verde who died in 2009.|$|E

5|$|The {{solution}} circle may {{be either}} internally or externally tangent {{to each of}} the given circles. An external tangency is one where the two circles bend away from each other at their point of contact; they lie {{on opposite sides of the}} tangent line at that point, and they exclude one another. The distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii. By contrast, an internal tangency is one in which the two circles curve in the same way at their point of contact; the two circles lie on the same side of the tangent line, and one circle encloses the other. In this case, the distance between their centers equals the difference of their radii. As an illustration, in Figure1, the pink solution circle is internally tangent to the medium-sized given black <b>circle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right, whereas it is externally tangent to the smallest and largest given circles on the left.|$|E

25|$|Complement is {{implemented}} with an inverter gate.

25|$|Later in the 19th century, the German {{mathematician}} Bernhard Riemann developed Elliptic geometry, another non-Euclidean geometry {{where no}} parallel {{can be found}} and the sum of angles in a triangle is more than 180°. It was proved consistent by defining point to mean a pair of antipodal points on a fixed sphere and line to mean a great <b>circle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sphere. At that time, the main method for proving the consistency {{of a set of}} axioms was to provide a model for it.|$|E
25|$|The angular {{velocity}} of a particle is measured around or {{relative to a}} point, called the origin. As shown in the diagram (with angles ɸ and θ in radians), if a line is drawn from the origin (O) to the particle (P), then the velocity (v) of the particle has a component along the radius (radial component, v‖) and a component perpendicular to the radius (cross-radial component, v⊥). If there is no radial component, then the particle moves in a <b>circle.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, {{if there is no}} cross-radial component, then the particle moves along a straight line from the origin.|$|E

If a member of the team with ring possession violates the crease with a stick, skate, arm, etc., the play is stopped and the goalie receives the ring. If any member of the non-possession team violates the crease, their team cannot touch the ring for five seconds (counted by the referee), or possession of the ring is given to the other team.|$|E
25|$|In the 2000s, most buses had {{a mostly}} white livery with a {{predominantly}} blue strip running horizontally {{along the side}} and a large white “T” inside a red <b>circle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof. Diesel–electric hybrid buses introduced {{toward the end of}} the decade spurred new color schemes, with yellow at the front and the blue line moved above the side windows. The METRO light-rail vehicles have a different color scheme: predominantly blue and white, with yellow on each end. Metro Transit also uses vehicle wrap advertising on some buses and light rail cars, creating a different appearance.|$|E
25|$|U.S. Routes 202 and 206 {{intersect}} with NJ Route 28 at the Somerville <b>Circle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> borders with Bridgewater Township and Somerville, {{with the}} eastern half of the circle located in Raritan. As part of an ongoing effort to improve traffic safety at the circle, the New Jersey Department of Transportation has made a series of changes to the structure of the traffic circle, originally constructed during the 1930s. With the suburbanization of the area, the circle was handling an average of 70,000 vehicles each day. In 1994, an overpass was completed to allow traffic on Route 202 between Flemington and Interstate 78 and Interstate 287 to avoid the circle, though the rate of accidents grew from 195 in 1991 before the project started to 302 for the year after the overpass was open to traffic. After yield signs were added in February 1995, the accident rate increased again, to an annualized rate above 400 per year.|$|E
