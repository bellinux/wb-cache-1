Along with the jackdaw, the Eurasian magpie's nidopallium is approximately the same relative size as those in chimpanzees and humans, significantly larger than the gibbon's. Like other corvids, such as ravens and crows, their total brain-to-body mass ratio is equal to most great apes' and cetaceans'. A 2004 review suggests that the intelligence of the corvid family to which the Eurasian magpie belongs is equivalent to that of great apes (chimpanzees, orangutans, and gorillas) in terms of social cognition, <b>causal</b> <b>reasoning,</b> flexibility, imagination, and prospection.|$|E

In this dissertation, we therefore developed and investigated a learning-environment intended to foster students’ ability for <b>causal</b> historical <b>reasoning.</b> Based {{on the model of}} domain learning and the framework of historical <b>reasoning,</b> we defined <b>causal</b> historical <b>reasoning</b> as a construct consisting of (knowledge of) second-order concepts, causal strategies and epistemological beliefs. In the first study, we designed a lesson-unit on the First World War and conducted a quasi-experimental study with 11 th-grade preuniversity students. In a second study, we replicated the experiment in a randomized controlled design. We concluded that explicit teaching constituted an indispensable principle in developing <b>causal</b> historical <b>reasoning.</b> Students in the experimental (explicit) condition showed greater improvement on the knowledge of causal strategies and second-order concepts. Furthermore, these students reported learning-gains related to epistemological aspects of causal explanations. At post-test in the experimental condition, a strong correlation was found between epistemological beliefs and students’ interest. Applying knowledge of <b>causal</b> historical <b>reasoning</b> in a document-based writing-task remained difficult for students. A qualitative study showed that students were able to integrate aspects of <b>causal</b> historical <b>reasoning</b> in their texts, but that they struggled with the argumentative nature of the task. Throughout the studies, epistemological beliefs surfaced as an important dimension of students’ historical reasoning, but assessing these beliefs was complex. Therefore, in the final study, we developed a new questionnaire aimed at evaluating naïve and nuanced epistemological beliefs...|$|R

It is argued that data on <b>causal</b> conditional <b>reasoning</b> not only tell us some-thing about how people draw deductive inferences from condi-tionals, but also provide us with information about how they understand causal relations. In particular, three principles emerge from existing data: the modal principle, the exhaustive principle, and the equivalence principle.

40|$|Normative causal {{decision}} theories {{argue that}} people should use their causal knowledge in decision making.

We will summarize findings from empirical research, which indicate that decision makers use their <b>causal</b> knowledge and <b>reasoning</b> when making a choice. Focusing on decision making in mental health, we will also show that at least sometimes the outcomes resulting from a chosen action can be improved by taking causal knowledge into account. In {{the second part of}} the chapter, we propose a structured process describing when and how decision makers should use <b>causal</b> knowledge and <b>reasoning</b> in decision making: the Causal-explanation-based Decision Making framework. Mental health will again be our exemplary domain. We will end by arguing that our model may serve as a blueprint for a rational model for clinical decision making, which may also guide future research...|$|R

50|$|Effectuation is a {{principle}} introduced by Saras Sarasvathy in 2001. Since 1997 Sarasvathy conducted a research among 27 expert entrepreneurs. Sarasvathy interviewed the entrepreneurs {{and let them}} solve cases {{in order to see}} how they think and where they start. It appeared that 89% of the expert entrepreneurs used effectuation more often than causation. Causation is the opposite of effectuation. Where effectuation is used in situations of uncertainty, <b>causal</b> <b>reasoning</b> is used when the future is predictable. With <b>causal</b> <b>reasoning,</b> entrepreneurs will determine goals to achieve and look for the resources to do so.

40|$|Of {{the several}} {{theories}} of causation current in our days, Hume {{is said to}} be the inspiration of two of the most influential and accepted: the regularity theory, first clearly formulated by Thomas Brown in 1822, and the counterfactual theory, proposed by David Lewis in 1973. After a brief outline of the comparative merits and difficulties of these two views, I proceed to examine whether Hume's own treatment of causation actually corresponds to any of them. I will show that his first definition of cause, coupled with his rules by which to judge about causes and effects, contains elements that, properly developed, allow us to address successfully some traditional difficulties of the regularity view of causation, without resorting to the conceptual resources employed in the counterfactual approach. Therefore, we can properly classify Hume as an advocate of the conception of causation as regularity, noting however that his primary goal in his research and definitions of the concept was to provide not so much an analysis of causation as such, but of causation as we apprehend it, in the form of our ability to make causal inferences and refine them to reach the more sophisticated <b>causal</b> <b>reasonings</b> that are required in the theoretical and practical issues of life...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} seeks {{to develop a}} {{pedagogy}} aimed at fostering a student’s ability to reason causally about history. The Model of Domain Learning (Alexander, 2003) {{was used as a}} framework to align domain-specific content with pedagogical principles. Developing <b>causal</b> historical <b>reasoning</b> was conceptualised as a multi-dimensional process in which knowledge of first- and second-order concepts, strategies, epistemological beliefs and interest play a role. Five pedagogical principles (inquiry tasks, social interaction, situational interest, explicit teaching of domain-specific strategies and concepts, and epistemological reflection) were established and operationalised for <b>causal</b> historical <b>reasoning.</b> The effectiveness of the principles was explored in a lesson-unit concerning the outbreak of the First World War. A quasi-experimental pre-test-post-test study was conducted with two conditions in three 11 th grade pre-university classrooms. Students in the implicit condition worked in triads on the inquiry task. Students in the explicit condition worked on the same task but with explicit attention given to strategies, concepts and epistemological underpinnings. The results showed that first-order knowledge increased in both conditions, but students in the explicit condition acquired significantly more knowledge of second-order concepts and causal strategies. However, no differences were found in students’ written explanations. Several possible reasons for this are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|Hume then {{passes from}} the will {{itself to the}} motivational factors that {{determine}} voluntary actions. Against the traditional view that reason and the passions frequently come into motivational conflict, Hume argues that reason is incapable of opposing the passions, and that the passions cannot run contrary to reason. First, reason alone cannot motivate us—it can only perform demonstrative or <b>causal</b> <b>reasoning.</b> And since abstract demonstrations influence us only by directing <b>causal</b> <b>reasoning</b> (e.g., doing math to pay your debts), and <b>causal</b> <b>reasoning</b> influences us only by directing preexisting motives (e.g., {{figuring out how to}} make the food you want), reason itself cannot bring about any motivation. And this in turn means it cannot counteract or regulate the passions: on the contrary, [...] "reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions". Second, passions cannot be in agreement or disagreement with reason: for {{this is a matter of}} the agreement or disagreement between an idea and the object it represents, and passions do not represent anything else. Thus Hume notoriously writes: [...] "'Tis not contrary to reason to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger". Of course, if a passion is based on a false judgment—about an object that doesn't really exist, or a causal relation that doesn't really hold—then the passion can be considered [...] "unreasonable" [...] in a less strict sense of the term. But [...] "even then", insists Hume, [...] "'tis not the passion, properly speaking, which is unreasonable, but the judgment". Finally, Hume argues that the alleged conflict between reason and the passions is actually a conflict between two different kinds of passions—the calm passions and the violent passions. Since both the calm passions and reason [...] "operate with the same calmness and tranquility", we confuse them with each other and mistakenly suppose our calm passions to be [...] "determinations of reason".|$|E
50|$|Baillargeon's {{research}} on <b>causal</b> <b>reasoning</b> in infants furthered understanding concerning Piaget's theory of cognitive development.

Baillargeon argues that Piaget's finding regarding infants' failure to understand object permanence until 8-12 months old was rooted in a lack of motor ability as opposed to inadequate cognitive development. In an effort to account for infants' lack of motor skills, Baillargeon's studies of object permanence measure infants' fixation times on impossible versus possible events.|$|E
