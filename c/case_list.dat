40|$|Abstract When an {{employer}} need to fire employees because of redundancy {{it has been}} found out that foreign-born workers are more negative affected than workers who is born in Sweden. The employer can apply several of provisions of 22 § LAS to create the <b>case</b> <b>list.</b> The regulations have in some cases been criticized to contribute to a structural discrimination on the Swedish labour market. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine how the employer in different ways can affect the <b>case</b> <b>list</b> and examine whether the rules can be an example of structural discrimination, and how this in turn may affect the foreign-born workers. A legal dogmatic method has been applied to investigate the legal situation. And addition have also been made from a legal sociological method to create a picture to see how the situation for foreign-born employees looks on the Swedish labour market. The results of the study showed that the employer has great potential to influence the <b>case</b> <b>list</b> and that the employers right to lead the work is a strong principle. The biggest restriction in the employers right to lead the work is in the regulation that says that decision cannot be discriminatory. If the employer would make a decision that is disadvantage for some groups, there must be a factual statement for the decision. Furthermore, the study also concluded that there is a form of structural discrimination from the regulation of 22 § LAS. The structural discrimination is especially showed in how the law is constructed, and in norms and values that was held by employers and institutions...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To use a {{routinely}} collected large {{surgical procedures}} dataset {{to understand the}} relationship between <b>case</b> <b>list</b> order and operative performance. Summary Background Data: We propose that the analysis of large clinical datasets can facilitate our understanding of the conditions necessary for optimal surgical performance. Recent reviews suggest that how surgeons prepare for a procedure (“warm up”) can affect performance. Operating lists present a natural experiment to explore this phenomenon. Methods: Case lists involving the 35 most frequently performed procedures by senior surgeons across 38 private hospitals in the UK over 26 months were examined. A linear mixed effects model (on 255, 757 procedures) and matched analysis (including 48, 632 pairs of procedures) were used to estimate the impact of list order and the cost of switching between procedures on a list whilst controlling for key prognosticators (age, ASA-PS). The influence of procedure modality (open vs. minimally invasive) and complexity was also explored. Results: Repeating the same procedure in a list resulted in an overall time reduction of 0. 98 % for each increase in list position. Switching between procedures increased operating time duration by an average of 6. 48 %. We show an overall reduction in operating time from completing the second procedure relative to the first is 6. 18 %. This pattern of results was consistent across procedure modality and complexity. Conclusions: There is a robust relationship between operating list composition and surgical performance (indexed by operating time). An evidence based approach to structuring a <b>case</b> <b>list</b> could reduce the total time spent performing procedures...|$|E

40|$|Background: Choosing an optimum set {{of child}} health {{interventions}} for maximum mortality impact is important within resource poor policy environments. The Lives Saved Tool (LiST) is a computer model that estimates the mortality and stillbirth impact of scaling up proven {{maternal and child health}} interventions. This paper will describe the methods used to estimate the impact of scaling up interventions on neonatal and child mortality. Model structure and assumptions: LiST estimates mortality impact via five age bands 0 months, 1 - 5 months, 6 - 11 months, 12 - 23 months and 24 to 59 months. For each of these age bands reductions in cause specific mortality are estimated. Nutrition interventions can impact either nutritional statuses or directly impact mortality. In the former <b>case,</b> <b>LiST</b> acts as a cohort model where current nutritional statuses such as stunting impact the probability of stunting as the cohort ages.
