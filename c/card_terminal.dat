Square Register combines payment processing with point-of-sale functionality like itemization and inventory management, and integrates with third-party platforms such as Shopventory, Weebly, and Bigcommerce via an App Marketplace.|$|R
5000|$|ATM cards {{can also}} be used on improvised ATMs such as [...] "mini ATMs", merchants' <b>card</b> <b>terminals</b> that deliver ATM {{features}} without any cash drawer. These terminals {{can also be}} used as cashless scrip ATMs by cashing the receipts they issue at the merchant's point of sale.|$|R
50|$|Thermal {{paper is}} a special fine paper that is coated with a {{chemical}} (previously often containing BPA) that changes color when exposed to heat. It is used in thermal printers and particularly in inexpensive or lightweight devices such as adding machines, cash registers, and credit <b>card</b> <b>terminals.</b>|$|R

50|$|A payment {{terminal}}, {{also known}} as a point of sale terminal, credit <b>card</b> <b>terminal,</b> EFTPOS terminal (or a PDQ terminal in the United Kingdom), is a device which interfaces with payment cards to make electronic funds transfers.|$|E
50|$|A <b>card</b> <b>terminal,</b> {{also called}} EFT-POS terminal, {{consists}} of {{hardware and software}} components. The main hardware components are the security module, the PIN pad, the printer, the display, the magnetic card reader, the chip-card reader, the communication module and the power supply.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the chips}} in {{financial}} cards {{are the same}} as those used in subscriber identity modules (SIMs) in mobile phones, programmed differently and embedded in a different piece of PVC, chip manufacturers are building to the more demanding GSM/3G standards. So, for example, although the EMV standard allows a chip card to draw 50 mA from its <b>terminal,</b> <b>cards</b> are normally well below the telephone industry's 6 mA limit. This allows for smaller and cheaper financial <b>card</b> <b>terminals.</b>|$|R

50|$|Powerclub is {{the second}} type, issued when an account's balance reaches $30. This card offers VIP prices, as well as {{eligibility}} to participate in Powerclub events. A holder is {{given the opportunity to}} create a personalised greeting given by the <b>card</b> <b>terminal's</b> LCD whenever the card is swiped on an arcade terminal.|$|R
50|$|For example, if an {{individual}} has a credit limit of $100 and uses a credit card to make a purchase at a retail store for $30, then the available credit will immediately decrease to $70 because the merchant has obtained an authorization from the individual's bank by swiping the card through its credit <b>card</b> <b>terminal.</b>|$|E
50|$|A credit <b>card</b> <b>terminal</b> is a {{stand-alone}} piece of electronic equipment {{that allows a}} merchant to swipe or key-enter a credit card's information as well as additional information required to process a credit card transaction. They may be connected to Point of Sale systems and typically have a keypad and network connection and may have a built-in printer.|$|E
50|$|A {{debit card}} works {{slightly}} differently. Like {{in the previous}} example, if one has a balance of $100 in the bank and used a debit card to make a purchase at a retail store for $30, the available balance will immediately decrease to $70, as a hold on the $30 is enacted because the merchant has obtained an authorization from the bank by swiping the card through the credit <b>card</b> <b>terminal.</b> However, the actual balance with the bank is still $100, because the merchant has not actually collected the funds in question.|$|E
50|$|This {{station has}} two island {{platforms}} {{on the third}} floor, serving two tracks each. Trains for different railway companies stop at adjacent platforms without any physical barriers, but transfers can only be made between the two by using special IC <b>card</b> <b>terminals</b> located within the station.The station is directly connected to Rinku Gate Tower Building.|$|R
50|$|On May 5, 2011, Michaels sent {{an email}} alert to its {{customers}} revealing that its debit <b>card</b> <b>terminals</b> in 20 states had been compromised. Customers who made PIN-based purchases between February 8 and May 6, 2011 {{may have had}} their data exposed. A class action lawsuit was filed against Michaels in the County Court of Passaic, New Jersey over the incident.|$|R
50|$|The first {{standard}} for smart payment cards was the Carte Bancaire M4 from Bull-CP8 deployed in France in 1986, {{followed by the}} B4B0' (compatible with the M4) deployed in 1989. Geldkarte in Germany also predates EMV. EMV was designed to allow <b>cards</b> and <b>terminals</b> to be backwardly compatible with these standards. France has since migrated all its <b>card</b> and <b>terminal</b> infrastructure to EMV.|$|R
50|$|On March 26th, 2010, Barry Altman founded Commodore USA. Commodore USA's first {{consumer}} product was a re-branded Cybernet Systems all-in-one keyboard PC. In 2011, Commodore USA began prototyping and injection molding an exact {{replica of the}} original Commodore 64, which was shortly thereafter noticed by {{the vice president of}} Disney, who wanted to set up a joint marketing venture between the Commodore 64x and TRON: Legacy. According to Barry in an interview, Commodore USA received an unexpected amount of publicity and orders for the Commodore 64x after the release of such advertisements, resulting in their credit <b>card</b> <b>terminal</b> even overheating on several occasions.|$|E
50|$|A {{merchant}} account has {{a variety}} of fees, some periodic, others charged on a per-item or percentage basis. Some fees are set by the merchant account provider, but the majority of the per-item and percentage fees are passed through the merchant account provider to the credit card issuing bank according to a schedule of rates called interchange fees, which are set by Visa, Discover, and MasterCard. Interchange fees vary depending on card type and the circumstances of the transaction. For example, if a transaction is made by swiping a card through a credit <b>card</b> <b>terminal</b> it will be in a different category than if it were keyed in manually.|$|E
50|$|A {{merchant}} {{can replace}} the functionality of dedicated credit <b>card</b> <b>terminal</b> hardware using a terminal application {{running on a}} PC or mobile device, such as a smartphone. They usually work with dedicated hardware readers that can transfer magnetic stripe data to the application, while {{there are also some}} that also work with smart cards (using technology such as EMV), although this is rarely seen on smartphone readers. In case the necessary hardware is unavailable, these applications usually support manual entry of the card number and other data. In addition, more and more devices are beginning to offer built-in RFID or NFC technology to accommodate contactless or mobile device payment methods, often without requiring additional external hardware.|$|E

50|$|In the alternate, some {{prefer to}} buy their {{currency}} before they travel, either just {{for a sense of}} security against credit card fraud typically achieved by tampered card readers or hackers, or because they speculate the exchange rate is better at that time than it will be when they make their trip. As well, some places may only take cash or have credit <b>card</b> <b>terminals</b> down.|$|R

50|$|All card {{terminals}} {{working with}} the electronic cash system have to be certified by the ZKA (the German Central Credit Committee) {{in order to take}} part in cashless payment transactions. Terminals working exclusively with EDD do not require a ZKA certificate. Operating a <b>card</b> <b>terminal</b> requires a provider contract with the network operator. The data collected by the terminal is processed by the provider. For the time the terminal is in use the user (for example, the retailer) can contact the service provider. He can call a hotline and is guaranteed on-site technical support by a technician. He has a contact person who helps with questions about the account, transaction control, managing the contract, etc.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ability to}} accept Nutrition Assistance Program {{benefits}} was added in 2010. All three {{locations of the}} Red Stick Farmers Market and the Main Street Market accept benefits from Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Woman, Infants, and Children (WIC), and Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program (SFMNP). [...] All benefits are accessed by an Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card, which looks and operates like a debit card. At all locations, patrons may take their EBT cards to the debit and credit <b>card</b> <b>terminal</b> to have their cards swiped in exchange for tokens worth $5 each. Tokens can be used at any vendor booth. SNAP customers receive an extra $10 in tokens after shopping at the market three times.|$|E
