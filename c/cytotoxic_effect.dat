5|$|The kidney {{toxicity}} of ethylene glycol occurs 24 to 72 hours post ingestion and {{is caused by}} a direct <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>effect</b> of glycolic acid. The glycolic acid is then metabolized to glyoxylic acid and finally to oxalic acid. Oxalic acid binds with calcium to form calcium oxalate crystals which may deposit and cause damage to many areas of the body including the brain, heart, kidneys, and lungs. The most significant effect is accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys which causes kidney damage leading to oliguric or anuric acute kidney failure. The rate-limiting step in this cascade is the conversion of glycolic to glyoxylic acid. Accumulation of glycolic acid in the body is mainly responsible for toxicity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Nanoparticulate silver {{coatings}} for {{orthopaedic implants}} promise to decrease postoperative infection rates. However, silver-induced cytotoxicity on bone cells {{has not been}} investigated in detail. This study investigated the <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of silver nano- and microparticles and Ag(+) on osteoblasts (OBs) and osteoclasts (OCs) and correlated their effects with the antibacterial efficacy on Staphylococcus epidermidis. Silver nanoparticles (50 nm) exhibited strong <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> on OBs and OCs. Weak <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> were observed for silver microparticles (3 μm). The cytotoxicity was primarily mediated by a size-dependent release of Ag(+). Antibacterial effects occurred at Ag(+) concentrations that were 2 - 4 times higher than those inducing <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>effects.</b> Such adverse effects on OB and OC survival may have deleterious effects on the biocompatibility of orthopaedic implants. Our study represents an important step toward the detailed investigation of orthopaedic implant with nanoparticulate silver coatings prior to their widespread clinical usage...|$|R

25|$|Deaths from snakebites are {{uncommon}} {{in many parts}} of the world, but are still counted in tens of thousands per year in India. Snakebite can be treated with antivenom made from the venom of the snake. To produce antivenom, a mixture of the venoms of different species of snake is injected into the body of a horse in ever-increasing dosages until the horse is immunized. Blood is then extracted; the serum is separated, purified and freeze-dried. The <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>effect</b> of snake venom is being researched as a potential treatment for cancers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{human form}} of IAPP has the amino acid {{sequence}} KCNTATCATQRLANFLVHSSNNFGAILSSTNVGSNTY, with a disulfide bridge between cysteine residues 2 and 7. Both the amidated C-terminus and the disulfide bridge are necessary for the full biological activity of amylin. [...] IAPP is capable of forming amyloid fibrils in vitro. Within the fibrillization reaction, the early prefibrillar structures are extremely toxic to beta-cell and insuloma cell cultures. Later amyloid fiber structures also seem to have some <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>effect</b> on cell cultures. [...] Studies have shown that fibrils are the end product and not necessarily the most toxic form of amyloid proteins/peptides in general. A non-fibril forming peptide (1–19 residues of human amylin) is toxic like the full-length peptide but the respective segment of rat amylin is not. It was also demonstrated by solid-state NMR spectroscopy that the fragment 20-29 of the human-amylin fragments membranes. Rats and mice have six substitutions (three of which are proline substitions at positions 25, 28 and 29) that are believed to prevent the formation of amyloid fibrils, although not completely as seen by its propensity to form amyloid fibrils in vitro. Rat IAPP is nontoxic to beta-cells when overexpressed in transgenic rodents.|$|E

40|$|The {{cytostatic}} and <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> {{of highly}} purified natural human tumor necrosis factor (HuTNF-alpha) and natural human interferon-alpha (HuIFN-alpha) on 23 cell lines were studied in vitro. Natural HuTNF-alpha showed cytostatic and <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> on PC- 9, KHG- 2, HT- 1197, KG- 1 and L- 929 cells, and HuIFN-alpha showed both effects on KHG- 2 and Daudi cells. A mixture of HuTNF-alpha and HuIFN-alpha (1 : 1, by unit) showed cytostatic and <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> on HuTNF-alpha- or HuIFN-alpha-resistant cell lines such as KB, KATO-III, HEp- 2, P- 4788, {{as well as}} on HuTNF-alpha- or HuIFN-alpha-susceptible cells. Thus, the combined preparation of HuTNF-alpha and HuIFN-alpha expanded the spectrum of sensitive cells. The dosage of the mixed preparation required to produce 50 % inhibition of cell growth was less than 20 % of that of HuTNF-alpha or HuIFN-alpha alone. These results indicate that the cytostatic and <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of HuTNF-alpha and HuIFN-alpha are synergistically enhanced when they are administered together. </p...|$|R
30|$|In summary, the <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of ZnO {{hierarchical}} architectures, such as NPs {{and hollow}} microspheres consisting of NPs, the prism-like and flower-like structures, were evaluated using RSC 96 Schwann cells as the model. The ZnO NPs and microspheres displayed significant <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> on RSC 96 Schwann cells in time- and concentration-dependent manners. The treatment of cells with ZnO NPs and microspheres induced remarkable cell apoptosis and G 2 /M cell cycle arrest which {{were associated with}} the decomposition of ZnO hierarchical architectures and the subsequent release of Zn 2 + in the culture media. These results provide new insights into the <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of complex architectures that could be prominently dominated by nanoscale building blocks.|$|R
2500|$|Other, {{more complex}} {{relationships}} {{have been observed}} {{as a consequence of}} mutated AR; some mutations associated with male phenotypes have been linked to male breast cancer, prostate cancer, {{or in the case of}} spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, disease of the central nervous system. [...] The form of breast cancer seen in some men with PAIS is caused by a mutation in the AR's DNA-binding domain. [...] This mutation is thought to cause a disturbance of the AR's target gene interaction that allows it to act at certain additional targets, possibly in conjunction with the estrogen receptor protein, to cause cancerous growth. The pathogenesis of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) demonstrates that even the mutant AR protein itself can result in pathology. [...] The trinucleotide repeat expansion of the polyglutamine tract of the AR gene that is associated with SBMA results in the synthesis of a misfolded AR protein that the cell fails to proteolyze and disperse properly. [...] These misfolded AR proteins form aggregates in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus. [...] Over the course of 30 to 50 years, these aggregates accumulate and have a <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>effect,</b> eventually resulting in the neurodegenerative symptoms associated with SBMA.|$|E

40|$|Wound {{dressings}} {{may induce}} <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>effects.</b> In this study, we check several, mostly commercially available, wound dressings for cytotoxicity. We used our previously described, newly developed and highly sensitive 7 d methylcellulose cell culture with fibroblasts as the test system. Cytotoxicity is assessed by monitoring cell growth inhibition, supported by cell morphological evaluation using light and transmission electron microscopy. We tested conventional wound dressings, polyurethane-based films, composites, hydrocolloids and a collagen-based dressing. It was shown that only 5 out of 16 wound dressings did not induce <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>effects.</b> All 5 hydrocolloids {{were found to}} inhibit cell growth (> 70 %), while cells had strongly deviant morphologies. The remaining wound dressings showed medium <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>effects,</b> with cell growth inhibition, which varied from low (+/- 15 %), medium-low (+/- 25 %) to medium-high (+/- 50 %). Measurable <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of dressings detected in vitro are likely to interfere with wound healing when applied in vivo.

40|$|The <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA) {{have been}} {{considered}} {{to be caused by}} free radicals produced by the drug. The present study was carried out {{to determine whether or not}} <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of Fe-NTA on cell growth and lipoperoxide formation of Chinese hamster cells were reduced by antioxidants. Using a spin trapping technique, we found that hydroxyl radical formation in the cells increased in the presence of Fe-NTA. Antioxidants, with the exception of superoxide dismutase, slightly inhibited production of the hydroxyl radical. Mannitol significantly reduced lipoperoxide formation, but other antioxidants did not. However, the growth inhibitory effects of Fe-NTA were not attenuated by these antioxidants. These results indicated that the <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of Fe-NTA may be mostly due to unknown factors other than oxygen free radicals. </p...|$|R
40|$|When {{injected}} into the fourth ventricle, the proinflammagen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces acute neuroinflammation in the whole brain of rats. The new compound PMS 777 is a novel platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) antagonist and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. The current study determined whether PMS 777 could provide neuroprotection from the <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> associated with LPS-induced neuroinflammation. Acute LPS infusions impaired recognition in rats {{as measured by the}} Morris water maze. In addition, LPS infusions decreased the number of AChE positive cells, and increased the number of OX- 42 immunoreactive microglia and GFAP immunoreactive astrocytes in the hippocampus, the cortex and the basal nuclei. Furthermore, acute infusions of LPS also impaired organelles associated with protein synthesis. Peripheral administration of PMS 777 (i. e., intraperitoneal injection) protected against the impairment in recognition, and attenuated the <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of the acute inflammatory processes upon cholinergic cells, microglia, astrocytes and ultrastructure of hippocampal cells. Here, we propose that the <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of acute neuroinflammation may involve the release of PAF and loss of cholinergic neurons, and this mechanism leads to neuronal dysfunction and spatial memory impairment.
