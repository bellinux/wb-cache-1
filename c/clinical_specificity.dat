5000|$|Drugs such as opium, alcohol, {{and certain}} {{plants have been}} used for millennia by humans to ease {{suffering}} or change awareness, but until the modern scientific era nobody knew how these substances worked. The first half of the 20th century saw psychology and psychiatry as largely phenomenological, in that behaviors or themes which were observed in patients could often be correlated to a limited variety of factors such as childhood experience, inherited tendencies, or injury to specific brain areas. Models of mental function and dysfunction were based on such observations. Indeed, the behavioral branch of psychology dispensed altogether with what actually happened inside the brain, regarding most mental dysfunction as what could be dubbed as [...] "software" [...] errors. In the same era, the nervous system was progressively being studied at the microscopic and chemical level, but there was virtually no mutual benefit with clinical fields—until several developments after World War II began to bring them together. Neuropsychopharmacology may be regarded to have begun in the earlier 1950s with the discovery of drugs such as MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, thorazine and lithium which showed some <b>clinical</b> <b>specificity</b> for mental illnesses such as depression and schizophrenia. Until that time, treatments that actually targeted these complex illnesses were practically non-existent. The prominent methods which could directly affect brain circuitry and neurotransmitter levels were the pre-frontal lobotomy, and electroconvulsive therapy, the latter of which was conducted without muscle relaxants which often caused the patient great physical injury.|$|E
40|$|Background: Campylobacter spp. are {{difficult}} to recover in culture due to sub-optimal specimen transport and/or storage conditions and lack of universal culture procedures. However, Campylobacter antigens may persist in clinical specimens {{in the absence of}} viable organisms. The variable <b>clinical</b> <b>specificity</b> reported for commercial Campylo-bacter antigen detection assays remains controversial. We sought to resolve the incon-sistency observed in serveral studies regarding the <b>clinical</b> <b>specificity</b> of Campylobacter antigen detection by evaluating an immunochromatographic assay for Campylobacter antigen in comparison to micro aerobic culture, with discrepant specimens interro-gated by PCR. In addition, we examined the stability and reactivity profile of other Cam-pylobacter species with the antigen assay. Materials: 500 fecal specimens submitted over a 4 month period for routine stool cul-tures or Campylobacter-specific cultures were tested with the Immunocard STAT® Campy antigen assay (Meridian Bioscience, Cincinnati, OH).

Specimens from a random sample of 1, 437 controls (women ages 40 to 60 years with normal cytological findings and without evidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher [≥CIN 2] within up to 8 years of follow-up) and 192 cases (women ages 30 to 60 years in whom ≥CIN 3 was detected within up to 3 years of follow-up) were subjected to analysis by the PapilloCheck method. When all 17 (probably) hrHPV types were taken into account, the PapilloCheck assay had a clinical sensitivity for the detection of ≥CIN 3 of 96. 4 % (185 / 192 samples; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 93. 7 to 99. 7) and a <b>clinical</b> <b>specificity</b> for the detection of ≥CIN 2 of 96. 3 % (95 % CI, 95. 3 to 97. 3). After restriction of the analysis by the PapilloCheck assay to the 14 hrHPV types targeted by GP 5 +/ 6 +-PCR-EIA, the clinical sensitivity and <b>clinical</b> <b>specificity</b> values were 95. 8 % (95 % CI, 92. 8 to 98. 8) and 96. 7 % (95 % CI, 95. 7 to 97. 7), respectively.

40|$|There {{are about}} 350 million chronic {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) carriers worldwide. A proactive {{approach to the}} management of this disease is likely to reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by HBV. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a novel tool for discriminating between infected and noninfected subjects, the hepatitis B sAg/eAg test (Binax Inc., Portland, Maine). The test is designed to rapidly and accurately detect both the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and the HBV e antigen (HBeAg). A cohort of 942 subjects was tested. The serum clinical sensitivity of the hepatitis B sAg/eAg test was 99. 75 and 96. 37 % for HBsAg and HBeAg, respectively. Serum <b>clinical</b> <b>specificity</b> was 99. 32 % for HBsAg and 98. 99 % for HBeAg. Analytical sensitivity was satisfactory {{for the purposes of}} population screening. Visual evaluation showed that the test signals were stable for at least 3 h after the recommended evaluation time. No interference or cross-reactivity was observed with known interfering substances and virologic markers. These results indicate that the hepatitis B sAg/eAg test is well suited to the accurate detection of HBV carriers. In addition to the good <b>clinical</b> <b>specificity</b> and sensitivity of this test, its stability and user-friendly design mean that a correct performance, even under field conditions, is highly likely.

When all 17 HR-HPV types were considered, CA showed a clinical sensitivity of 96. 9 % (95 % CI: 93. 8 - 98. 5) and a <b>clinical</b> <b>specificity</b> of 71. 9 % (95 % CI: 64. 9 - 78. 0). In conclusion, the CA test is objective, reproducible, efficient, sensitive, and has a similar performance with HC 2 for ≥CIN 2. Furthermore, this assay has the advantage to detect and genotyping 35 HPV types within a single test, which can give more information relative to the predictive value of HR-HPV infection...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{clinical}} {{interest and}} decreasing sequencing costs are driving the wider implementation of clinical {{next generation sequencing}} assays for the diagnosis of inherited disease, including among {{a growing number of}} small to medium sized clinical laboratories. Therefore, an optimal combination of cost-effectiveness and <b>clinical</b> <b>specificity</b> is required to continue this broad adoption of genomic technology for clinical diagnosis. Sanger confirmation of all NGS variants is a common practice that increases both cost and turnaround time for clinical reporting. We reviewed 300 cases of Sanger verified NGS results as well as 60 suspected (and subsequently confirmed) artifacts, and developed a set of multiple criteria to report NGS variants without Sanger verification with 100 % accuracy. Using these criteria, we project greater than 80 % of clinically reported variants could be confidently released without Sanger confirmation...|$|E
40|$|Summary 1. Three {{forms of}} {{iatrogenic}} serum enzyme alteration are presented, each entailing a different mechanism of action. 2. Recent modifications in creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) assay systems have greatly increased {{the sensitivity of}} this measurement. This increase in sensitivity {{has been accompanied by}} a relative decrease in <b>clinical</b> <b>specificity.</b> In patients receiving intramuscular injections of drugs, resort may have to be made to the SGOT, LDH or isoenzymes of LDH. The latter also appear to be the only common measurements not liable to modification by narcotics injected intra-muscularly in patients with biliary tract disease. 3. Post-valvulotomy patients with anginal chest pain cannot be satisfactorily assessed by LDH or LDH isoenzyme assays. CPK and SGOT estimations are the procedures of choice because of their relative insusceptibility to activity changes secondary to hemolysis...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{adaptation}} into Spanish and on the validation of the Eating Attitudes TEst (EAT- 40; GArner & Garfinkel, 1979). 95 clinical cases aged 12 - 54 and 89 control females aged 8 - 49 are considered. REsults from Principal Component Analysis showed a unidimensional structure of item scores, {{the internal consistency of}} scale scores being 0. 969. Using the classification of subjects obtained by Clinical Interview based on DSM-IV-TR Criteria (APA, 2002), ROC analysis gives an optimal cut-off of 27 on EAT- 40 scores, clinical accuracy being AUC = 0. 976. EAT- 40 demonstrated good <b>clinical</b> utility, <b>specificity</b> bieng 94, 38 % and sensitivity 93. 68 %, permiting discrimination between subjects with or without ED...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Extrapulmonary {{small cell}} {{carcinoma}} is a rare, prognostically bad tumor category. Primary, {{it can be}} localized in every organ, even in the ovary, where, due to its <b>clinical</b> <b>specificities,</b> it represents a challenge in diagnosis, {{as well as in}} therapy. Small cell ovarian carcinoma (SCOC) is biologically very aggressive malignant tumor of unknown histogenesis. We presented a rare case of SCOC with hypercalcemia of aggressive course and fatal outcome in a postmenopausal woman at International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Ia stage. Case report. A 60 -year-old woman, Caucasian, came to the doctor because of discomfort in the lower abdomen and pain of greater intensity in last few days. Ultrasound examination and CT scan of the abdomen confirmed the presence of large adnexal masses of cystic-solid appearance with the largest diameter of 13 cm, regular structure of the other gynecological organs, without verifying the existence of metastatic deposits. All the results of laboratory analysis gave normal values, except for calcium, which was elevated. Explorative laparotomy with complete hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, dissection of lymph nodes and omentectomy were conducted. Based on pathohistological analysis of the operative material, SCOC at FIGO Ia stage was diagnosed. No complications were observed in a postsurgery period and after 10 days the patient was discharged in a good condition and with normal calcemia. The treatment was continued with concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, in spite of overall treatment, the disease progressed, and the patient died of disseminated metastatic disease, 26 months after the diagnosis. Conclusion. Small cell carcinoma localized in the ovary is generally a tumor category with bad prognosis depending on the stage of the disease...|$|R
30|$|While {{the broader}} {{clinical}} assessment {{is beyond the}} scope of this paper, we found in intra-individual comparison consistently improved image quality, detection, and classification of small lesions. It demonstrated that higher definition reconstruction appears to be of major clinical relevance for improved lesion detectability and characterization of lesion heterogeneity without increasing diagnostic ambiguity. It is expected that both the <b>clinical</b> sensitivity and <b>specificity</b> will be improved by dPET.|$|R
