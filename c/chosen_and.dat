5|$|After the {{establishment}} of Bodø/Glimts in 1916 and Grand Bodø the following year, the clubs played at various locations throughout the town. The primary venue for the clubs' elite teams was Bodø Station. By 1962, plans had surfaced for a central stadium for the prime sports clubs. The interest spurred a large protest meeting organized by the various sports clubs in town {{in support of the}} municipality building a new venue. Two locations were considered: at Plassmyra, now the location of the Norwegian Aviation Museum, and at Aspmyra. The latter was <b>chosen</b> <b>and</b> the plans were passed by the municipal council in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Before {{releasing}} {{their first}} album with Sire, Uncle Tupelo needed a drummer. Farrar and Tweedy interviewed twenty-four candidates and were both impressed with Ken Coomer and Bill Belzer.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Choose</b> <b>and</b> Book is {{a central}} part of the UK Government patient choice agenda that seeks to provide {{patients}} with a choice over the time, date and place of their first outpatient appointment. This is done {{through the use of a}} computerised booking system. After a 2004 pilot study, <b>Choose</b> <b>and</b> Book was formally launched in January 2006. This is the first study of patient experience of <b>Choose</b> <b>and</b> Book since then. Methods A questionnaire survey of reported experience of choice over the time, data and place of appointment, carried out in a National Health Service hospital in London. 104 patients at their first outpatient appointment completed the questionnaire, consisting of a consecutive series of patients referred through <b>Choose</b> <b>and</b> Book and a sample referred through the conventional booking system. Results Among the <b>Choose</b> <b>and</b> Book patients, 66 % (31 / 47; 95 % CI 52 to 78 %) reported not being given a choice of appointment date, 66 % (31 / 47; 95 % CI 52 to 78 %) reported not being given a choice of appointment time, 86 % (37 / 43; 95 % CI 74 to 94 %) reported being given a choice of fewer than four hospitals in total and 32 % (15 / 47; 95 % CI 20 to 46 %) reported not being given any choice of hospital. Conclusion In this study, patients did not experience the degree of choice that <b>Choose</b> <b>and</b> Book was designed to deliver. </p...|$|R

5|$|Keith John Moon (23 August 1946– 7 September 1978) was an English drummer {{who played}} with the English rock band the Who. He was noted for his unique style and his eccentric, often self-destructive behaviour. His {{drumming}} continues to be praised by critics and musicians. He was posthumously inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 1982, becoming only the second rock drummer to be <b>chosen,</b> <b>and</b> in 2011, Moon was voted the second-greatest drummer in history by a Rolling Stone readers' poll.|$|E
5|$|Sir William Rae, the Lord Advocate, {{followed}} a regular technique: {{he focused on}} one individual to extract a confession on which the others could be convicted.

Hare made a full confession of all the deaths and Rae decided sufficient evidence existed to secure a prosecution. On 4 December formal charges were lain against Burke and McDougal for the murders of Mary Paterson, James Wilson and Mrs Docherty.|$|E

5|$|TWR had {{manufactured}} {{a number}} of these racing V12 engines during the 1980s and they had been raced competitively, with a 7-litre version of this engine featuring in the Le Mans winning Silk Cut Jaguar XJR-9. Five of these engines still existed, all of which were fitted with dry sump lubrication. These engines were <b>chosen</b> <b>and</b> considered to be especially useful as the dry sump would lower the vehicle's centre of gravity. The displacement of the V12 was set at 6.2 litres (6222cc) for the XJ220. The engine fitted to the XJ220 concept had titanium connecting rods.|$|E
5|$|The Dorniers were {{devoid of}} German equipment, {{including}} engines. The Yugoslavs found a French manufacturer {{to supply the}} powerplants instead. Gnome et Rhône was the supplier <b>chosen,</b> <b>and</b> the Gnome-Rhône Mistral Major engine was {{to be used in}} the Dornier. The French had inflated the performance data of the engine, claiming it to have 649kW (870hp) and a speed of 420km/h (261mph) at 3,850m (12,320ft). The constant-speed propellers were also poor, and delivered late. This led to trials with Piaggio Aero and Ratier propellers.|$|E

5|$|By 1799, the {{original}} house at Luscombe had been demolished, and work began {{on a new}} house for Hoare in 1800. The house was designed by John Nash, who was a pioneer for the Gothic Revival style. In his early drawings for the house, Repton suggested two sketches to Hoare; one of a more standard house, {{and the other with}} the more natural design which would settle into the landscape. The latter was <b>chosen</b> <b>and</b> the final design of the house was based upon Downton Castle, but with an asymmetrical plan to experience the panoramic views around the house. It was Nash's first attempt at a Gothic castle design and he would subsequently create several further houses in the same style.|$|E

Playing for Middlesex against the Australians, Allen took six for 77 but was overlooked for the first Test at Trent Bridge, Nottingham. England won the match during the course of which Larwood, the incumbent fast bowler in the team, fell ill. Allen opted to play for Middlesex against Northamptonshire while the team for the second Test was being <b>chosen,</b> <b>and</b> took six for 77.

5|$|In 2005, a {{business}} case was developed with three options {{to extend the}} life of the fleet. The first two options involved expanding the service life extension program (SLEP) at a cost of $4.6 billion and $3.16 billion respectively. The third option, worth $1.72 billion, was to build 242 new wings and avoid the cost of expanding the SLEP. In 2006, option 3 was <b>chosen</b> <b>and</b> Boeing won the contract. The base contract is for 117 wings with options for 125 additional wings. In 2013, the Air Force exercised a portion of the option to add 56 wings, putting 173 wings on order with options remaining for 69 additional wings. In November 2011, two A-10s flew with the new wings fitted. The new wings improved mission readiness, decreased maintenance costs, and allowed the A-10 to be operated up to 2035 if necessary. The re-winging effort was organized under the thick-skin urgent spares kitting (TUSK) program.|$|E
5|$|Novick sent Cody's {{screenplay}} to {{his friend}} Jason Reitman; by the time Reitman had read halfway through the script, he felt {{that if he did}} not direct the film, he would regret {{it for the rest of}} his life. Initially, Reitman found it difficult to acquire the script, because his first film, Thank You for Smoking, had not been released yet, so he did not have any feature film credits. Other directors, including Jon Poll, were considered, but Reitman was <b>chosen</b> <b>and</b> he interrupted work on his own spec script in order to direct Juno. Cody says she had a cynical attitude when writing Juno ("I didn't ever think this film would be produced") and, indeed, the film was delayed by financial problems. After its controversial nature scared off a number of major studios, John Malkovich's production company, Mr. Mudd, took on the project. It was later brought to production company Mandate Pictures by co-producer Jim Miller.|$|E
5|$|Romania ordered 126 of {{the tanks}} on 14 August 1936 as the R-2 and {{received}} the first 15, which had been diverted from the Czech order, in April–May 1937 to display in a parade. They suffered from numerous teething problems and the Romanians put a hold on production until these issues were resolved. The constantly changing Romanian demands didn't help the situation, but they refused to accept any vehicles until trials were conducted in Romania. Three R-2s were shipped to Romania on 12 July 1938 for the trials, but Skoda knew which one would be <b>chosen</b> <b>and</b> prepared the vehicle well and it passed all tests. After disassembly and checks of the trial tank were completed, the Romanian commission approved the design on 23 August. In the meantime, the initial batch was returned to Skoda to be upgraded to current standards on 28 July. Shipments to Romania began on 1 September with 27 shipped before the Munich Crisis forced the Czechs to hold all remaining tanks in case they were needed. 5 finished tanks and 6 almost-finished tanks were appropriated and shipped to Slovakia although they were quickly returned after the Munich Agreement was signed. The last shipment departed on 22 February 1939.|$|E
