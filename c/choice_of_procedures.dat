40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the impact of {{structure}} of dependency and the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedures</b> for rare-event simulation on the pricing of multi-name credit derivatives such as nth to default swap and Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDO). The correlation between names defaulting has an effect on the value of the basket credit derivatives. We present a copula based simulation procedure for pricing basket default swaps and CDO under different structure of dependency and assessing the influence of different price drivers (correlation, hazard rates and recovery rates) on modelling portfolio losses. Gaussian copulas and Monte Carlo simulation is widely used to measure the default risk in basket credit derivatives. Default risk is often considered as a rare-event and then, many studies have shown that many distributions have fatter tails than those captured by the normal distribution. Subsequently, the choice of copula and the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedures</b> for rare-event simulation govern the pricing of basket credit derivatives. An alternative to the Gaussian copula is Clayton copula and t-student copula under importance sampling procedures for simulation which captures the dependence structure between the underlying variables at extreme values and certain values of the input random variables in a simulation have more impact on the parameter being estimated than others. ...|$|E

40|$|Cardiometabolic {{disorders}} {{are characterized by}} a complex pathophysiology and increased risk of mortality. Experimental evidence shows that some rearrangements of GI anatomy can directly affect glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, and inflammation, supporting {{the idea that the}} GI tract is a biologically rational target for interventions aimed at correcting pathophysiologic aspects of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Recent randomized controlled trials show that GI surgery results in superior glycemic control compared with conventional medical and lifestyle approaches in patients with diabetes. Such mechanistic and clinical evidence is transforming traditional bariatric surgery, focused on weight reduction, into a new surgical discipline aimed at the improvement of metabolic regulation and reduction of cardiometabolic risk (“metabolic surgery”).

40|$|Pancreatic cancer (PC) is {{extremely}} severe malignant disease with a five-year survival {{of less than}} 5 %. Currently there is no reliable tool for the diagnosis of PC in its early stages. At the time of clinical symptoms most patients are in an advanced stage {{of the disease and}} the treatment does not usually have a significant effect. For these reasons emphasis is gradually shifting to the search for the suitable molecular markers for improvement of the diagnosis and assessment of the survival prognosis with respect to a possibility of surgical treatment. MiRNA represent {{one of the most promising}} markers, although, their examination in pancreatic tissue is a complicated process. One of the reasons is the very small amount of the source material coming from a fine needle biopsy. A second cause of problems is the subtle character of the pancreatic tissue resulting in significantly lower yields of molecular genetic analysis when compared to other epithelial tissues. An additional negative factor is heterogeneity of the tissue resulting in disproportionate representation of tumor cells within the sample.

In our model the legislature is ini-tially procedurally neutral- all legislators share proposal and amendment power equally.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is the price {{calibration}} of basket default swap from Japanese market data. The value of this instruments depend on the number of factors including credit rating of the obligors in the basket, recovery rates, intensity of default, basket size and the correlation of obligors in the basket. A fundamental part of the pricing framework is the estimation of the instantaneous default probabilities for each obligor. Because default probabilities depend on the credit quality of the considered obligor, well-calibrated credit curves are a main ingredient for constructing default times. The calibration of credit curves take into account internal information on credit migrations and default history. We refer to Japan Credit Rating Agency to obtain rating transition matrix and cumulative default rates. Default risk is often considered as a rare-event and then, many studies have shown that many distributions have fatter tails than those captured by the normal distribution.

40|$|Purpose: Surgical {{treatment}} {{for prostate cancer}} has continuously evolved {{over the last years}} – most recently with the introduction and dissemination of the Robotic Assisted Prostatectomy (RARP). The purpose of this work is to provide a learning curve comparison between the relatively new RARP and the Open Retropubic Prostatectomy (RRP) that has been established practice for many decades. Method: retrospective single surgeon comparative study with a total of 353 Patients (232 RARPs vs. 121 RRPs) who underwent prostate surgery at the Department of Urology of the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin between September 2008 and August 2012. Biochemical Recurrence Free Survival (BFS) was compared using the log-rank test. Biochemical Recurrence (BCR) predictor analysis was calculated using the Cox regression model. Results: statistically significant differences in favor of RARP were demonstrated for estimated blood loss, transfusion rate, hospital stay, catheter time, complication rate and return to continence. Although shorter average operative times were achieved with the RRP, increased operative experience with the RARP reduced RARP operating times substantially, towards RRP average operative times. The recovery of erectile function {{did not appear to be}} impacted by the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedures.</b> Although PSM rates were similar among both procedures, BFS was higher among patients that underwent RRP. Gleason sum > 7, tumor stage pT 3 b, pT 4 and N 1 as well as RARP were independent predictors of BCR. Conclusion: Beyond the generally accepted advantages of minimal invasive surgery, our investigation outlines indicates potential benefits of RARP concerning complication rate and functional outcome.

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the 9 -month {{clinical}} outcomes of patients treated with paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES) or sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) for coronary artery stenosis. BackgroundThe STENT (Strategic Transcatheter Evaluation of New Therapies) registry is the first multicenter registry in the U. S. to collect long-term outcomes of drug-eluting stents from “real-world” practice. MethodsData on all percutaneous coronary interventions in 8 U. S. hospital centers were collected in the STENT registry between 2003 and 2005. In this prospective, nonrandomized, observational study, the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedures</b> was at the physicians’ discretion. Patients who only received a PES (n = 4, 671) or SES (n = 4, 555) and completed 9 -month follow-up (93. 8 % of eligible) were included for analysis. Primary end points were death, myocardial infarction (MI), and target vessel revascularization (TVR) at 9 months. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (any of the 3 primary end points) and stent thrombosis. ResultsAt 9 months, death, MI, and TVR occurred in 2. 2 %, 2. 0 %, and 4. 1 %, respectively, of the PES group and 2. 5 %, 2. 2 %, and 4. 3 %, respectively, of the SES group (p = NS); MACE occurred in 7. 5 % of the PES group and 8. 0 % of the SES group (p = 0. 37). After adjustments for group differences in baseline characteristics, TVR (hazard ratio [HR] 0. 88, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 70 to 1. 32; p = 0. 26) and MACE (HR 0. 95, 95 % CI 0. 81 to 1. 12; p = 0. 56) were similar for PES and SES.

In the first study, minority group members perceived the combination of proportional representation and majority vote to be significantly less fair than all other combinations, and their <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedure</b> stressed "mutual control" (when the decision rule exceeds the number of representatives possessed by either group). In a second study, majority group members perceived the combination of equal representation and majority vote to be significantly less fair than other <b>procedures,</b> but their <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedure</b> did involve a considerable degree of mutual control.
