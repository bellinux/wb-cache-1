5|$|AJ's Infinite Summer is an {{animated}} television pilot created by Toby Jones for Cartoon Network. The pilot follows AJ, whose new job {{during the summer}} drives him <b>crazy</b> <b>with</b> power. It is loosely based on Jones' 2006 film, AJ Goes to France. Both the film and the pilot star AJ Thompson as the eponymous character. Jones additionally sought inspiration from his hometown of Fargo, North Dakota, and the comics he drew featuring Thompson and his other friends. The pilot was released on the official website of Cartoon Network on May 16, 2014.|$|E
25|$|The films {{released}} {{during this}} period were: Feet First, with a similar scenario to Safety Last which found him clinging to a skyscraper at the climax; Movie <b>Crazy</b> <b>with</b> Constance Cummings; The Cat's-Paw, which was a dark political comedy and a big departure for Lloyd; and The Milky Way, which was Lloyd's only attempt at the fashionable genre of the screwball comedy film.|$|E

On February 3, 2006, Super Crazy and Psicosis bounced back by nearly defeating MNM in a tag title defense. They appeared to have the gold in the grasp, but their dreams of winning the titles went up in smoke when Melina hit Super <b>Crazy</b> <b>with</b> her boot as he went for a moonsault. MNM capitalized and retained.|$|E

That group {{was joined by}} Psicosis II and Electroshock as well as Los Mini Vipers, Mini-Estrella Mini Abismo Negro, Mini Histeria and Mosquito de la Merced. Not long after Los Vipers was formed AAA had to replace the original Histeria, who became Super <b>Crazy</b> <b>with</b> a new Histeria. Only {{a short time later}} AAA also had to replace the original Mosco de la Merced as well, when he left the promotion, with a new Mosco de la Merced, sometimes referred to as Mosco de la Merced II.|$|E
25|$|Burr {{moved to}} New York in 1940, {{and made his}} first Broadway {{appearance}} in <b>Crazy</b> <b>With</b> the Heat, a two-act musical revue produced by Kurt Kasznar that quickly folded. His first starring role on the stage came in November 1942, {{when he was an}} emergency replacement in a Pasadena Playhouse production of Quiet Wedding, directed by Lenore Shanewise. He {{became a member of the}} Pasadena Playhouse drama faculty for 18 months, and he performed in some 30 plays over the years. He returned to the Broadway stage for Patrick Hamilton's The Duke in Darkness (1944), a psychological drama set during the French Wars of Religion. Burr's performance as the loyal friend of the imprisoned protagonist led to a contract with RKO Radio Pictures.|$|E

500|$|In November 1923 Stanley Baldwin's Conservative Government fell. In the {{following}} month's general election Bondfield {{was elected in}} Northampton with a majority of 4,306 over her Conservative opponent. She {{was one of the}} first three women—Susan Lawrence and Dorothy Jewson were the others—to be elected as Labour MPs. In an outburst of local celebration her supporters, whom she described as [...] "nearly <b>crazy</b> <b>with</b> joy", paraded her around the town in a charabanc. The Labour Party had won 191 seats to the Conservatives' 258 and the Liberals' 158; with no party in possession of a parliamentary majority, the make-up of the next government was in doubt for several weeks.|$|E
500|$|... …And Justice for All is a musically {{progressive}} album featuring {{long and}} complex songs, fast tempos and few verse-chorus structures. Metallica decided to broaden its sonic range, writing songs with multiple sections, heavy guitar arpeggios and unusual time signatures. Hetfield later explained: [...] "Songwriting-wise, [...] was just us really showing off {{and trying to}} show what we could do. 'We've jammed six riffs into one song? Let's make it eight. Let's go <b>crazy</b> <b>with</b> it.'" [...] Music critic Simon Reynolds noted the riff changes and experimentation with timing on the album's epically constructed songs: [...] "The tempo shifts, gear changes, lapses, decelerations and abrupt halts". BBC Music's Eamonn Stack wrote that …And Justice for All sounds different from the band's previous albums, with longer songs, sparser arrangements, and harsher vocals by Hetfield. According to journalist Martin Popoff, the album was less melodic than its predecessors because of its frequent tempo changes, unusual song structures and layered guitars. He argued that the album {{is more of a}} progressive metal record because of its intricately performed music and bleak sound. Music writer Joel McIver called the album's music aggressive enough for Metallica to maintain its place with bands [...] "at the mellower end of extreme metal". According to writer Christopher Knowles, Metallica took [...] "the thrash concept to its logical conclusion" [...] on the album.|$|E
500|$|On Victor's {{rivalry with}} Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), Allison Waldman of AOL TV said: [...] "After all, their characters' on screen feud {{has been the}} stuff of soap legend. Victor and Jack have shared wives, corporations, but mostly, unabashed hatred. They despise each other." [...] Additionally, Waldman wrote: [...] "Braeden's {{contribution}} to the show these past three decades really cannot be understated. He's been a driving force as Victor primarily because he's a villain who's not quite pure evil. He has a heart and on occasion shows a vulnerability that makes him likable and even sympathetic" [...] but [...] "like a big jungle cat, he is not one to be tamed. That's why at any point, Victor can turn on someone he once professed to love [...] See, that's Victor. He makes viewers <b>crazy</b> <b>with</b> his actions, but he's so dynamic and interesting, that you can't stop watching him. Thank you, Eric Braeden. You are Victor and you have made him completely compelling for 30 years." [...] In another article, Waldman called Braeden {{one of the biggest}} stars in the soap opera business. Victor has adopted several nicknames on the show that have carried into the media. This includes [...] "The Mustache" [...] and [...] "The Dark Night". When asked which storyline he felt affinity for or strongly about in his thirty years during an interview with AOL TV, Braeden stated it was the scenes in which he met his dying mother, Cora Miller (Dorothy McGuire), {{for the first time since}} he was seven years old. The actor credited it as the turning point of his career on the show, describing it as [...] "a deeply-felt scene" [...] and something he would never forget. He said: ...|$|E

I'm not anti-gay. We're against gay marriage. I don't want gays to be discriminated against." [...] She added, [...] "I don't know why all gays aren't Republican.

2500|$|On September 17, 1998, John Geddes Lawrence Jr., a gay 55-year-old medical technologist, was hosting two gay acquaintances, Tyron Garner, age 31, and Robert Eubanks, 40, at his {{apartment}} in northeast Harris County, Texas, east of the Houston city limits. Lawrence and Eubanks had been friends for more than 20 years. Garner and Eubanks had a tempestuous on-again off-again romantic relationship since 1990. Lacking transportation home, the couple were preparing to spend the night. Eubanks, who had been drinking heavily, left to purchase a soda from a nearby vending machine. Apparently outraged that Lawrence had been flirting with Garner, he called police and reported [...] "a black male going <b>crazy</b> <b>with</b> a gun" [...] at Lawrence's apartment.|$|E

[...] When asked about recording Jones and Wynette, Sherill told Dan Daley in 2002, [...] "It did increase my scotch intake some. We started out trying to record the vocals together, but George drove Tammy <b>crazy</b> <b>with</b> his phrasing. He never, ever did {{it the same way}} twice. He could make a five-syllable word out of 'church.' Finally, Tammy said, 'Record George and let me listen to it, and then do my vocal after we get his on tape.' Tammy was a very quick study." ...|$|E
2500|$|Raggett {{described}} [...] "Pressure's On" [...] as {{a cousin}} to Laids opening song [...] "Out to Get You" [...] {{that could have}} [...] "easily fit" [...] on that album. It features a [...] "weirdly hypnotic synthesizer, the surreal, breathy vocals and the only occasionally comprehensible lyrics [...] to create a liquid, seductive, trippy sound." [...] "Jam J" [...] was compared to U2's Zooropa by Joyelle H. McSweeney of The Harvard Crimson, who noted the song contains [...] "driving rhythms, snarly lyrics obscured by feedback, and angry bursts of guitars breaking through the mess." [...] "Frequency Dip" [...] is said by one reviewer to recall U2's Zooropa and [...] "moves along with a throbbing bass loop and is thick on the drums. The vocals jump around in the song so much, {{it is as if}} someone is going <b>crazy</b> <b>with</b> the crossfader." [...] "Burn the Cat" [...] is a slow, minimalistic song with only minute guitar chords, drum beats and various snippets of vocals drifting {{in and out of the}} song. [...] "Tomorrow" [...] features a [...] "rather attackling" [...] drum line and interwinding guitar strum and vocals. [...] "Gospel Oak," [...] relies heavily on harpsichord-like synthesiser, with disorienting results.|$|E
