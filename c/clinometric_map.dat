40|$|Abstract—Since {{there is}} a defect that the surface of mine area has been covered with black dust and the {{spectral}} character is inconspicuous, this paper developed {{a new way to}} find the pile-like object. First, the <b>clinometric</b> <b>map</b> is set up based on the DSM which has been collected from the data that the airborne LiDAR generated in mine area. After the high resolution image ortho-rectified according to DSM, the object orientated information extraction method is adopted to divide the fused multisource remote sensing information into some homogeneous areas. This paper builds the pile-like object extraction model by means of analyzing the elevation information, slope, dispersion, spectral, and topology relationship. Furthermore, the experiment has proved it is a high-efficient and precise way to find the pile-like object in mine area.
