5|$|After the 2004 {{release of}} , Powderfinger took a hiatus, and several members {{played in the}} side {{projects}} Drag and The Predators. Fanning decided to work independently and acted on direction he felt unable to explore {{as a member of}} Powderfinger. Some of his inspiration was derived from a will {{to see if he was}} capable of recording a solo album, <b>considering</b> <b>what</b> he viewed as his limited guitar playing abilities; compared to bandmates Darren Middleton and Ian Haug. The distance from the band, coupled with the more relaxed writing process for Tea & Sympathy helped Fanning to unwind from the stress left over from 10 years working recording and touring with Powderfinger.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} added, forces can also be {{resolved}} into independent components {{at right angles to}} each other. A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions. This is because, for orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by <b>considering</b> <b>what</b> set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is {{in the same direction as}} one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component. Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two.|$|E

25|$|All {{legitimate}} children shared equally in the father's estate on his death, reservation being {{made of a}} bride-price for an unmarried son, dower for a daughter, or property deeded to favourite children by the father. There was no birthright attaching {{to the position of}} eldest son, but he usually acted as executor and, after <b>considering</b> <b>what</b> each had already received, equalized the shares. He even made grants in excess to the others from his own share. If there were two widows with legitimate issue, both families shared equally in the father's estate, until later times, when the first family took two-thirds. Daughters, in the absence of sons, had sons' rights. Children also shared their own mother's property, but had no share in that of a stepmother.|$|E
25|$|Astrobiology is an {{interdisciplinary}} field {{that uses a}} combination of geobiological and planetary science data to establish a context for the search for life on other planets. The origin of life from non-living chemistry and geology, or abiogenesis, is a major topic in astrobiology. Even though it is fundamentally an earth-bound concern, and therefore of great geobiological interest, getting at {{the origin of life}} necessitates <b>considering</b> <b>what</b> life requires, what, if anything, is special about Earth, what might have changed to allow life to blossom, what constitutes evidence for life, and even what constitutes life itself. These are the same questions that scientists might ask when searching for alien life. In addition, astrobiologists research the possibility of life based on other metabolisms and elements, the survivability of Earth’s organisms on other planets or spacecrafts, planetary and solar system evolution, and space geochemistry.|$|E
25|$|For Mago the setback was severe, <b>considering</b> <b>what</b> gains {{a victory}} would have brought. (In 218 BC, the {{victory in the}} battle of Trebia, in which Mago also {{distinguished}} himself, was followed by a general uprising of the Cisalpine Gauls, who joined Hannibal and made possible his march to the south.) The Romans were left in command of the Po Valley and all hopes for a repetition of the events {{from the beginning of the}} war faded. This was significant in view of the ongoing Roman advance in Africa. Scipio’s victories at Utica and the Great Plains and Mago’s failure in Cisalpine Gaul meant not only that Scipio could remain in Africa, but that Mago had to return to save his homeland. Messengers from Carthage reached Mago in the land of the Ingauni, and he set sail for Africa with a part of his army.|$|E

25|$|But {{the main}} problem for the British was discontent among their soldiers. The troops in India were no longer as {{uncritical}} {{as they had been}} when <b>considering</b> <b>what</b> they were being asked to do. Like other units of the British Army many of the troops considered the war over and looked forward to being demobilised. The Indian Army had been heavily committed to the First World War and had suffered a large number of casualties. Many of its units still had not returned from overseas, and those that had, had begun the process of demobilisation and as such many regiments had lost almost all their most experienced men. Likewise, the British Army in India had been gutted. Prior to 1914 there had been 61 British regiments serving in India. However, of these all but 10 (two cavalry and eight infantry) had been withdrawn in order to fight in Europe or the Middle East. In their place, units of the Territorial Army (TA), part-time soldiers usually only intended for home defence but who had volunteered for overseas service, had been sent in order to release regular units for the fighting in France. After four years of mundane garrison duty, away from their families and disaffected, most of these men were really only interested in demobilisation and returning to Britain to get on with their lives. They were in no way prepared for a hard fought campaign on the Indian frontier.|$|E
