50|$|The {{system uses}} an {{electronic}} wheel lock and a <b>cable</b> <b>lock,</b> all controlled by embedded microcontroller with touchscreen LC display. A set of 1024 pregenerated lock/unlock codes {{are unique to}} each bike and stored in memory.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>locks</b> are in {{many ways}} similar to chain <b>locks.</b> <b>Cable</b> <b>locks</b> often come with the locking {{mechanism}} already permanently integrated. Otherwise, a length of cable with loops on both ends can also be used.|$|R
50|$|Simple <b>cable</b> <b>locks,</b> however, {{are only}} {{sufficient}} {{for use in}} low-risk areas. Even the largest diameter unprotected cable can be quickly cut with bolt cutters. More robust <b>cable</b> <b>locks</b> have overlapping steel jackets threaded over the cable. This can {{make it more difficult}} to cut the central cable.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>locks</b> are {{the most}} common type of lock used on the snow. <b>Cable</b> <b>locks</b> {{designed}} specifically for the snow are generally thinner than typical locks for bikes. This is to make them more lightweight as the user often must carry them around with them during the day. <b>Cable</b> <b>locks</b> are fastened by simply wrapping the cable around the skis or board (and through any loops in the binding if available) and then clicking back into the main body. They are usually fastened with a code or with a key requiring oftentimes that the user remove their gloves which can be unpleasant in very cold weather.|$|R
50|$|A {{jack chain}} {{is a type}} of chain made of thin wire, with figure-eight-shaped links, and loops at right angles to each other. Jack chains are often used to suspend {{fixtures}} such as lights or signs, for decorative purposes, or as part of a <b>cable</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|E
50|$|PPQ pistols are {{delivered}} in a polymer pistol case containing the pistol, three backstraps of different sizes, two magazines (one standard length and one extended grip length), magazine loader, safety <b>cable</b> <b>lock,</b> instruction manual, warranty papers, factory test target showing five shots fired at 15 m distance, and an envelope with {{the case of the}} proof round fired during the proof test at the C.I.P. accredited Beschussamt Ulm (Proof House Ulm).|$|E
40|$|Portland {{is known}} as Bike City U. S. A for its {{promotion}} of a eco friendly method of transportation and support of biking infrastructure. Although our city has this progressive reputation, there is a negative aspect of a bike-loving city that has not received attention. The Oregon Household Activity survey in 2011 states that “about 29 percent of adults in Multnomah, Clackamas and Washington counties own a bike”. As more people has decided to commute with bikes, theft has increased dramatically. According to the Portland Police Bureau, “Portland thieves last year took more than 2, 100 bikes worth well over 1 million combined”. In an attempt to solve this problem, the police bureau has proposed to create {{a task force to}} patrol areas of possible bike theft. Although this {{is a step in the}} right direction, it is not a realistic solution to this problem. The cost to employ more policemen to patrol the city would be high and most of these crimes are not prosecuted by in court. We talked to people who have experienced bike theft in Portland. Kimberly K said “I didn 2 ̆ 7 t understand how they could have stolen my bike because I had a <b>cable</b> <b>lock.</b> I was really angry and was afraid my insurance wouldn 2 ̆ 7 t pay for it. ” John B said “I didn’t have enough money to buy a new bike and I didn’t buy bike insurance so I couldn’t buy a bike for over a year...|$|E

50|$|Ski and {{snowboard}} locks are {{a special}} form of lock used {{by people in}} snow sports (skis, snowboarders, cross country ski) to protect their equipment whilst they are not around.Ski and Snowboard locks come in many shapes and sizes but the most common today is <b>cable</b> <b>locks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>locks</b> are {{a popular}} type of chamber lock that usually threads through the breech and {{ejection}} port of repeating-action firearms; they generally prevent full cycling of the action, especially preventing {{a return to}} [...] "battery", with the breech fully closed. In many designs of pistol and rifle, they also prevent the proper insertion of a magazine.|$|R
50|$|Tether locks are {{probably}} {{the second most common}} type of lock seen on the mountain and protecting equipment. These are typically more rugged and heavy weight than the <b>cable</b> <b>locks</b> which increases the protection they can provide at the expense of convenience. The user is still generally required to carry the lock around with them during the day.|$|R
25|$|Physical {{controls}} {{monitor and}} control {{the environment of the}} work place and computing facilities. They also monitor and control access to and from such facilities. For example: doors, locks, heating and air conditioning, smoke and fire alarms, fire suppression systems, cameras, barricades, fencing, security guards, <b>cable</b> <b>locks,</b> etc. Separating the network and workplace into functional areas are also physical controls.|$|R

50|$|Wordlock is a {{brand of}} {{combination}} locks, made by Wordlock, Inc., that differs from traditional combination locks in that it has letters on its dials instead of numbers. This allows the combination to be a four-letter or five-letter word or name, similar to a password, and therefore potentially easier to remember than a series of digits. Wordlocks come in luggage locks, bike <b>locks,</b> padlocks, <b>cable</b> <b>locks</b> and commercial locks.|$|R
50|$|Pacsafe is a {{brand of}} travel {{equipment}} with emphasis on anti-theft features. Pacsafe is headquartered in Hong Kong with offices in the United States, Germany, and China. The company's range of products include adventure backpacks, urban and leisure bags, women’s bags, photography bags, luggage and travel accessories such as straps, <b>cables</b> and <b>locks.</b>|$|R
25|$|As Mk. I {{arrived in}} the field, a number of {{improvements}} in the basic electronics were introduced. These were collected together to form the Mk. I* version. The differences between the Mk. I and Mk. I* were primarily in details. It was found that in certain orientations of the transmitter and receiver, the small antenna used to trigger the time base would see too small a signal to work. This {{was replaced by a}} cable between the two cabins, which was known as <b>cable</b> <b>locking.</b> Certain details of the RF stages on the receiver improved signal-to-noise ratio, a voltage regulator was added to correct for differences in generators, and a new system was introduced that replaced the complex grounding system for the potentiometer with an electronic version. A more major change was the introduction of anti-jamming features.|$|R
5000|$|In the rear-entry design, {{the entire}} foot area and sole are a single unit {{similar to a}} slipper. The leg cuff is split in two, with front and rear {{sections}} that meet at the hinge point at the ankle. The rear half of the cuff can pivot far to the rear, opening wide for easy entry. Closing a <b>cable</b> <b>locks</b> the moving rear portion forward onto the front half, forming the stiff cuff that pivots around rivets at the ankle like a conventional front-entry design. As the toe area is a single piece and lacks buckles for adjustment, rear-entry boots may have considerable [...] "slop", and various systems of cables, plates or foam-filled bladders were used to address this. The upside {{of this approach is}} that the foot area can be made larger, fitting almost any foot.|$|R
50|$|Possible {{production}} {{features that}} were on the concept: radio navigation system controlled by a multifunction touch screen, differential <b>locks,</b> <b>cable</b> winch and the rear logo opens the tailgate.|$|R
50|$|U-locks {{are more}} secure {{than most other}} kinds of locking {{mechanism}} {{because they are more}} resistant to cutting with high-leverage hand tools such as bolt cutters. However, most are still vulnerable to at least one type of exploit. For instance, if there is enough space for a thief to fit a jack into the U, the jack can produce enough leverage to break the lock. Another common brute force method to break open U-locks is to use a long length (perhaps 2 metre) of pipe to twist the lock open (although this method is more commonly used to defeat chain and <b>cable</b> <b>locks).</b> Like all locks, U-Locks are vulnerable to power tools such as portable angle grinders. A quality U-lock will advertise the material's hardness (relative resistance to grinding), its resistance to prying (expressed in tonnes, or pounds, for example, one might resist to 5 tonnes, which exceeds the 2-tonne capacity of a common car jack), as well as resistance to drilling into the keyhole itself.|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} {{computer}} security measures have emerged that aim at protecting data. The Kensington Security Slot {{along with a}} <b>locking</b> <b>cable</b> provides physical security against thefts of opportunity. This is a cord that is attached to something heavy that cannot be moved, and is then locked into {{the case of the}} laptop, but this is not 100% secure.|$|R
50|$|The Lock Haven Dam (also {{known as}} the Dunnstown Dam), {{was built in the}} 19th century {{primarily}} to provide water to the West Branch Canal. Canal boats crossed the pool behind the dam by means of a <b>cable</b> ferry between <b>Lock</b> No. 35 on the Lock Haven (Bald Eagle Crosscut Canal) side of the river and Lock No. 34 on the Lockport (West Branch Canal) side, about 2000 ft downriver from the Jay Street Bridge.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the pull-tight seal {{configured}} of plastic {{in the form of}} arrows. They have a surface for marking individual number and latching mechanism on the one hand, and a plastic cable on the other. Like a zip tie, the cable forms a loop during mill threading into the collet, which can not be separated without damaging the <b>cable</b> or the <b>locking</b> mechanism. Its integrity is monitored through a transparent cover.|$|R
50|$|Rack locks {{are another}} form of lock common at many European and American ski resorts. They provide {{a high level of}} {{security}} and are generally smaller and more convenient than either <b>cable</b> or tether <b>locks.</b> One of the downfalls of rack locks are that they must be used in conjunction with certain types of ski racks which are not found at all ski resorts. Another is that they only work at locations where these racks are located meaning less freedom.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, Fallin {{became the}} first woman and first Republican to be sworn in as {{lieutenant}} governor of Oklahoma, an office she would hold for 12 years. As lieutenant governor, Fallin served on 10 boards and commissions. Early in her tenure, the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, located in Oklahoma City, was bombed, killing 168 people in what became the worst case of domestic terrorism in United States history; Fallin led a task force to rebuild the childcare center that was lost in the attack. In 1997, she chaired the Fallin Commission on Workers’ Compensation, which released a comprehensive reform plan to lower costs in the state's workers' compensation system. Fallin promoted Project Homesafe, a national initiative of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms industry trade association, to distribute free <b>cable</b> gun <b>locks</b> {{to reduce the risk of}} accidental in-home shootings.|$|R
40|$|A {{knee brace}} for aiding in {{rehabilitation}} of damaged leg muscles includes {{upper and lower}} housings normally pivotable one relative to the other about the knee joint axis of a patient. The upper housing is attachable to the thigh of the patient above the knee joint while the lower housing is secured to a stirrup which extends downwardly along the patient's leg and {{is attached to the}} patient's shoe. An actuation rod is carried within the lower housing and is coupled to a cable. The upper and lower housings carry cooperative clutch/brake elements which normally are disengaged to permit relative movement between the upper and lower housings. When the cable is extended the clutch/brake elements engage and lock the housings together. A heel strike mechanism fastened to the stirrup and the heel of the shoe is connected to the cable to selectively extend the <b>cable</b> and <b>lock</b> the brace in substantially any position when the patient places weight on the heel...|$|R
50|$|Because {{they are}} valuable, {{commonly}} used, portable, {{and easy to}} conceal in a backpack or other type of travel bag, laptops are prized targets for theft. Every day, over 1,600 laptops go missing from U.S. airports. The cost of stolen business or personal data, and of the resulting problems (identity theft, credit card fraud, breach of privacy), can be many times {{the value of the}} stolen laptop itself. Consequently, physical protection of laptops and the safeguarding of data contained on them are both of great importance. Most laptops have a Kensington security slot, which can be used to tether them to a desk or other immovable object with a security <b>cable</b> and <b>lock.</b> In addition, modern operating systems and third-party software offer disk encryption functionality, which renders the data on the laptop's hard drive unreadable without a key or a passphrase. As of 2015, some laptops also have additional security elements added, including eye recognition software and fingerprint scanning components.|$|R
50|$|A {{restricted}} firearm must be disabled {{by use of}} a trigger, <b>cable,</b> {{or other}} <b>locking</b> device and locked in an opaque case.An unattended non-restricted firearm left in a vehicle must be locked in the trunk or other compartment, if one is available. In order to transport restricted or prohibited firearms, an individual must obtain an authorization to transport. An ATT is generally approved only for individuals to transport a restricted or prohibited firearm to a shooting range for target practice, gun show for sale, to a gunsmith or gun shop or for a competition (e.g.: IPSC).|$|R
