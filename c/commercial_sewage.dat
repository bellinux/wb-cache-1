For this to occur, treated wastewater must first move through groundwater before discharging to the Lagoon or ocean. In July 2009 and April 2010, δ 18 O and δD data showed that some samples from water-table wells contained as much as 70 % wastewater; at that time FIB concentrations in those samples were generally less than the detection limit of 1 Most Probable Number (MPN) per 100 milliliters (mL). In contrast, Malibu Lagoon had total coliform, Escherichia coli, and enterococci concentrations as high as 650, 000, 130, 000, and 5, 500 MPN per 100 mL, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{long-term}} fertilization with sewage sludge on the aerobic, chemoheterotrophic {{portion of a}} salt marsh bacterial community were examined. The study site in the Great Sippewissett Marsh, Cape Cod, Mass., consisted of experimental plots that were treated with different amounts of <b>commercial</b> <b>sewage</b> sludge fertilizer or with urea and phosphate. The number of CFUs, percentage of mercury- and cadmium-resistant bacteria, and percentage of antibiotic-resistant bacteria were all increased in the sludge-fertilized plots. Preliminary taxonomic characterization showed that sludge fertilization markedly altered the taxonomic distribution and reduced diversity within both the total heterotrophic and the mercury-resistant communities. In control plots, the total heterotrophic community was fairly evenly distributed among taxa and the mercury-resistant community was dominated by Pseudomonas spp. In sludge-fertilized plots, both the total and mercury-resistant communities were dominated by a single Cytophaga sp...|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} of 96 samples {{collected in the}} floodplain near {{the confluence of the}} St. Joe and St. Maries River in the vicinity of St. Maries, Idaho, reveals that lead pollution in soil is not a significant problem in this small town. Only one sample contained levels that would be considered hazardous to human health. When recreational, agricultural, industrial, residential, <b>commercial,</b> and <b>sewage</b> application land uses are compared, it is clear that residential soils {{are most likely to be}} elevated in lead even though the one contaminated sample was collected from an agricultural field. A comparison of samples collected from recently flooded and recently non‐flooded areas reveals that the highest levels of lead were found in areas recently flooded. This counters the assumption that flooding dilutes soil contamination...|$|R
30|$|Decentralised {{wastewater}} {{system is}} when raw wastewater is simply treated {{next to the}} source (point of generation according to Omenka 2010) through a range of simple technologies. Office of Water United States Environmental Protection Agency (2005 : 3) defines decentralised wastewater systems as consisting {{of a wide range}} of onsite and cluster treatment systems that process household and <b>commercial</b> <b>sewage.</b> The Rocky Mountain Institute (2004) defines decentralised systems as an alternative to conventional, centralised systems. In addition, the decentralised concept can be explained as an organisational paradigm for wastewater management (De Gisi et al. 2014; Sheehan 2011; Nhapi 2004 a, b, c) that entails treating and beneficially reusing wastewater as close to where it is generated as practical, using technologies appropriate to the scale of the facilities (Venhuizen 2003). A decentralised system may consist of individual on-site systems and/or cluster systems, either singly or in combination with more highly collectivised facilities as Libralato et al. (2012) advocates for a combination of a centralised and decentralised so as to maximise on the opportunities of each system. The degree of collectivisation at any stage of the treatment and reuse or dispersal processes will be determined by a variety of local circumstances, including topography, site and soil characteristics, development density, type of development, community desires with regard to land use issues, and sites of potential reuse and/or sites where discharge would be allowable. Some systems in arid regions promote evaporation or wastewater uptake by plants.|$|E
40|$|This study {{systematically}} {{analyzed the}} concentrations of cations and anions and determined the pH in the rainwater at Guiyang from Oct. 2008 to Sep. 2009. The pH in the rainwater varied between 3. 35 and 9. 99 with a volume-weighted mean value of 4. 23. The volume-weighted mean concentrations of anions followed the order SO 4 (2 -) > Cl-> F-> NO 3 (-), whereas the volume-weighted mean concentrations of cations followed the order Ca 2 +> NH 4 (+) > Na+> Mg 2 +> K+. This finding indicates that SO 4 (2 -) was the main anion and that Ca 2 + and NH 4 (+) were the main cations. Significant correlations between each pair of ions (SO 4 (2 -), NO 3 (-), NH 4 (+), Ca 2 +, and Mg 2 +) were observed, suggesting that CaSO 4, Ca(NO 3) (2), MgSO 4, Mg(NO 3) (2), NH 4 NO 3, (NH 4) (2) SO 4, and/or NH 4 HSO 4 exist in the atmosphere at Guiyang. The soil-derived species (such as Ca 2 +) {{played an important role}} in the neutralization of the acidity in rainwater. The SO 4 (2 -) and NO 3 (-) in the rainwater were mainly from anthropogenic sources, and their contributions accounted for 98. 1 % and 94. 7 %, respectively. NH 4 (+) was also most likely derived from anthropogenic sources, such as domestic and <b>commercial</b> <b>sewage,</b> and {{played an important role in}} the neutralization of the rainwater at Guiyang.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that pteris vittata may {{accumulate}} substantial quantities of arsenic (As) in its shoots. The present study involved collecting soils from 21 contrasting sites from around England which had been contaminated with arsenic as result {{of a wide range of}} human activities and natural causes. These were used to examine growth and As uptake by P. vittata in a series of pot experiments. Initial experiments used soil from 10 fields on a large <b>commercial</b> <b>sewage</b> disposal estate located north east of Nottingham. These soils were highly organic and contained high concentrations of heavy metals (Zn, Cu, - Cd and Pb) but limited contamination with As. In some cases, the presence of high concentrations of heavy metals resulted in poor fern growth and limited removal of,As. With this information in mind, the remairjng 20 soils were collected from historically contaminated areas of England to provide a wide range of sources and severity of As contamination, a range of associated heavy metal concentrations and varying soil types. The results showed that the capacity of P. vittata to remove As from the soil may be severely limited by a range of influential factors in historically contaminated natural soils. Availability of the total As pool present was often very low, ranging between 1. 7 and 16. 9 %. Indeed, soil solution concentrations were below the EU drinking water standard of 50 IJg L,l for all soils, with the Devon Great Consols humic soil having the highest solution As concentration of all soils examined, although this was nevertheless only 0. 33 mg L- 1 Â• This is believed to have occurred because the As was predominantly present as a constituent of minerals such as arsenopyrite in the mine spoil soils from the south west of England, or was strongly complexed within clay and iron oxides in the sewage treated soil. The highest percentage As removal was for two orchard soils (13. 3 and 9. 7 %) in which the As present originated from pesticides containing chromated copper arsenate (CCA), a form of As known to be available to P. vittata, which had been applied over extended periods. The frequent co-occurrence of high concentrations of heavy metals in the study soils again adversely affected biomass production and As uptake by P. vittata. Factors such as low soil pH may also have reduced growth in some soils, as well as reducing the availability of As for uptake. High phosphate concentrations in some soils may have acted antagonistically to reduce As uptake, as demonstrated in an experiment in which phosphate Was added to three contrasting soils; low phosphate applications increased biomass and As uptake, whereas higher applications blocked As uptake. An uptake model was developed to predict the uptake of arsenic from field soils by P. vittata and facilitate assessment of the impact of a range of influential factors on the phytoremediation potential of this species. This model allowed the performance of P. vittata to be predicted under a variety of soil conditions and the time-frame required to remove the labile As pool to be estimated depending on whether this was replenished from other pools or not. The overall conclusions were that, although P. vittata may be unable to access and remove the extremely large non-labile pool of As in some soils, this species could provide a valuable tool for removing the labile and, hence potentially hazardous, fraction from contaminated soils.

40|$|<b>Commercial</b> {{high-strength}} <b>sewage</b> {{has high}} organics and nitrogen, variable diurnal and seasonal flows, use of disinfectants and grease-strippers, and fast-food type employees. A pre-engineered treatment process developed to counter these challenges {{results in a}} more consistent effluent quality. Consistency is important for nitrogen removal, for difficult disposal sites, and for irrigation or toilet re-use. The standard process includes an exterior grease trap, septic tanks with effluent filters, surge flow storage in the pump tank, timed dosing to Waterloo Biofilter trickle filters, and 50 - 67 % re-circulation to the septic tank inlet. For on-site subsurface disposal, a shallow, thin sand Area Bed is preferred. UV disinfection is added for irrigation re-use, and multi-media filtration plus ozone + chlorine are added for toilet re-use. The additional key component is a separate, closed-loop BIOFILTER with 100 % return to the surge-pump tank. This independent BIOFILTER is hydraulically loaded at very high rates to remove organics and nitrogen, and to oxygenate the pump tank.

40|$|Hemicelluloses were {{extracted}} from corn husk and converted into cationic hemicelluloses using 2, 3 -epoxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride. The degree of substitution was determined as 0. 43 from results of elemental analysis. The cationic derivative was also characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Carbon- 13 magnetic nuclear ressonance. The produced polymer was employed as coagulant aid in a sewage treatment station (STS) {{of the municipal}} department of water and sewer (Departamento Municipal de Água e Esgoto - DMAE) in Uberlândia-Minas Gerais, Brazil, using Jar test experiments. Its performance was compared to ACRIPOL C 10 ï›š, a commercial cationic polyacrylamide regularly used as a coagulant at the STS. The best result of the jar-test essays was obtained when using cationic hemicelluloses (10 mg L- 1) as coagulant aid and ferric chloride as coagulante (200 mg L- 1). The resultsof color and turbidity reduction, 37 and 39 %, respectively, were better than when using only ferric chloride. These results were also {{higher than those of}} commercial polyacrylamide, on the order of 32. 4 and 38. 7 %, respectively.

30|$|Although, water {{pollution}} is a chief matter of apprehension {{in regard to}} Kolong River, the water quality issue of the river has not yet got its due importance. However, few scientific investigations on water quality assessment of Kolong River (Saikia and Sarma 2011; Barbaruah et al. 2012; Khan and Hazarika 2012; Bora and Goswami 2014, 2015) have been reported. Fluoride geochemistry of Kolong River was discussed elaborately by Saikia and Sarma (2011). They found that the fluoride concentration of groundwater samples collected from Kolong River basin ranged between 0.03 and 5.68  mg/l. Khan and Hazarika (2012) reported that the increased pollution level of Kolong River water is mainly attributed by the discharge of various types of domestic and <b>commercial</b> waste water, <b>sewage</b> and effluent. Moreover, the truncated river flow accompanied with diminished flow velocity has reduced the self-assimilation and self-purification capacity of the Kolong River (Bora and Goswami 2015). Ironically, literature survey revealed {{the fact that so}} far no detailed work on WQI has been carried out for Kolong River. Hence, in continuation of our previous work (Bora and Goswami 2014, 2015), the present investigation is carried out to establish the general pollution trend of the river and to determine the aptness of the water for various purposes based on a set of observed water quality parameters. In this context, an attempt has been made to determine the fitness of various water samples collected along Kolong River for different uses, using the ‘weighted arithmetic index method’ given by Brown et al. (1970).|$|R
40|$|Accounting for {{agricultural}} {{activities such as}} P fertilization in regional models of heavy metal accumulation provides suitable sustainable management strategies to reduce nutrient surpluses and metal inputs in agricultural soils. Using the balance model PROTERRA-S, we assessed the phosphorus (P), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) flux balances in agricultural soils of a rural region in Switzerland for different farm types and crop types. The P requirements of crops on arable farms were mainly supplied by <b>commercial</b> fertilizers and <b>sewage</b> sludge, while on animal husbandry farms P fertilizer demands were met by animal manure alone. Metal accumulation in soil was very different between the balance units. Estimated net Cd fluxes ranged between 1. 0 and 2. 3 g ha(- 1) yr(- 1) for arable farm types, 0. 6 and 2. 0 g ha(- 1) yr(- 1) for dairy and mixed farm types, and 9. 1 and 17. 8 g ha(- 1) yr(- 1) for animal husbandry farm types. Largest net Zn fluxes of 17. 9 - 39. 8 kg ha(- 1) yr(- 1) were estimated for animal husbandry farms, whereas for arable farm types net Zn fluxes of 101 - 260 g ha(- 1) yr(- 1) and for dairy and mixed farm types of 349 - 3360 g ha(- 1) yr(- 1) were found. The results indicate that P management is a primary factor determining the variation of these net Cd and net Zn fluxes. The latter were highly sensitive to the Zn/P concentration ratio in animal manure, atmospheric deposition and crop concentrations. Variation of net Cd fluxes resulted mainly from uncertainty in crop concentrations, atmospheric deposition, leaching parameters and uncertainty in Cd/P concentration ratio of commercial fertilizers. In addition, element balances were sensitive to empirical assumptions on fertilization strategy of farmers, such as the partitioning of manure between balance units...|$|R
40|$|Electrocoagulation {{has been}} {{recognized}} positively to treat the wastewater from steam cleaners, textile manufacturing, mining operations, <b>commercial</b> laundry, municipal <b>sewage</b> system plants and palm oil industrial effluents. In this technology, metal cations are released into water through dissolving metal electrodes. Simultaneously, beneficial side reactions can help in removing flocculated material from the water. In present study, three steps of treatment will be carrying out to treat the petroleum based wastewater. The treatment includes preliminary settling process, coagulation process and electrocoagulation process. Preliminary settling is a natural process where no additional of chemical coagulant or additive to the samples. The settling time is set to be 24 hours for all the suspended solids to settle down. Preliminary settling process showed a big removal efficiency in total suspended solid (TSS) of the samples. The efficiency of removal for TSS during the preliminary settling process for sample T- 1630, T- 2300 and PPT are 0 %, 72. 44 % and 75. 14 %. However, for coagulation process, the optimum dosage of coagulant required for three different samples were determined using jar test. There was huge reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration after the coagulation process. The removal efficiency achieved for the coagulation process is 27 %, 63 % and 65 % for sample T- 1630, T- 2300 and PPT respectively. Although the removal efficiency is higher, further treatment by using electrocoagulant is required to meet the discharge limit. The optimum voltage is determined and all the samples are treated with applied voltage of 100 V. The efficiency of removal for COD achieved during the electrocoagulation process for sample T- 1630, T- 2300 and PPT is 99. 75 %, 98. 74 % and 99. 62 % respectively which meet the permissible level, and save to discharge to the environmen...|$|R
