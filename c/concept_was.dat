40|$|What <b>are</b> <b>Concepts?</b> The {{discussion}} of conceptual change in part IV assumed that <b>concepts</b> <b>are</b> {{an important part}} of scientific knowledge, but largely ignored the crucial question of what <b>concepts</b> <b>are.</b> Previous chapters mentioned many important science concepts such as life, mind, and disease. I have taken for granted the standard cognitive science assumption that <b>concepts</b> <b>are</b> mental representations, but have not provided a theory of what <b>concepts</b> <b>are.</b> This chapter draws on ideas of Chris Eliasmith (forthcoming) to argue that concepts, including scientific ones, are semantic pointers- neural processes with powerful semantic, syntactic, and pragmatic capabilities. Most generally, <b>concepts</b> <b>are</b> representations corresponding to individual words that stand for classes of things; for example the concept car corresponding to the word “car ” that stands for the class of cars. The history of philosophy and cognitive science has witnessed many different interpretations of <b>concepts,</b> including: <b>Concepts</b> <b>are</b> abstract entities, for example the forms of Plato. • <b>Concepts</b> <b>are</b> copies of sense impressions, for example the ideas of Hume (1888). <b>Concepts</b> <b>are</b> data structures that depict prototypes, for example the frames o...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} {{experiments}} {{was to examine the}} accessibility of concepts embedded within text. J. A. Albrecht and E. J. O’Brien (1991) found that with narrative texts central <b>concepts</b> <b>are</b> more quickly retrieved than peripheral concepts. In contrast, F. R. Yekovich and C. H.

Over 13 experiments, central <b>concepts</b> <b>were</b> generally more quickly accessed than peripheral concepts. The only exception occurs when (a) script-based texts are used, (b) the number of mentions or elaboration of central and peripheral <b>concepts</b> <b>is</b> held constant, and (c) the measure of centrality is theme relatedness rather than degree of interconnectedness. Under those conditions, central <b>concepts</b> <b>are</b> more difficult to access than peripheral concepts...|$|R

50|$|The dictum de nullo says: Whatever {{is denied}} of a <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> also denied of {{everything}} that is contained under it.

5|$|The {{concept of}} Just Dance {{originated}} from a minigame developed {{for inclusion in}} the Rayman Raving Rabbids series. Ubisoft France's managing director Xavier Poix and his team felt the Wii Remote and Nunchuck would work well for music games; Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 featured a music minigame that IGN compared to Guitar Hero—where players shook the Wii Remote or Nunchuck when prompted to play an instrument. For , the <b>concept</b> <b>was</b> iterated into a pose-based dance game. Proving popular in demonstrations, the <b>concept</b> <b>was</b> refined and re-developed into a stand-alone game.|$|E

40|$|<b>Concepts</b> <b>are</b> interrelated to {{the extent}} that the {{characterization}} of each <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> influenced by the other <b>concepts,</b> and <b>are</b> isolated {{to the extent}} that the characterization of one <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> independent of other concepts. The relative categorization accuracy of the prototype and caricature of a <b>concept</b> can <b>be</b> used as a measure of concept interrelatedness. The prototype is the central tendency of a concept, whereas a caricature deviates from the concept’s central tendency in the direction opposite the central tendency of other acquired <b>concepts.</b> The prototype <b>is</b> predicted to be relatively well categorized when a <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> relatively independent of other concepts, but the caricature is predicted to be relatively well categorized when a <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> highly related to other concepts.

The allegations led to calls for an outside cost estimate to determine more realistic tunnel costs. On May 15, 2006, Virginia Transportation Secretary Pierce R. Homer announced the creation of an advisory panel headed by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The panel had about two months to evaluate options for completing the line through Tysons Corner, with the results presented to the state on July 27, 2006 and published on July 31, 2006.|$|E
5|$|Another {{alternative}} landing <b>concept</b> <b>was</b> the US Air Force's {{proposal to}} attach wings to the spacecraft. This proposal arose {{soon after the}} cancellation of the X-20 Dyna-Soar, and would have seen a Gemini spacecraft attached {{to a set of}} wings developed during the ASSET program. This would have been launched by a Titan II rocket, and would have been unable to maneuver in orbit. Another proposal saw the spacecraft being launched by a Titan IIIA or IIIC, using the Transtage for maneuvering. Once the mission was complete, the spacecraft would have been deorbited by means of five solid rocket motors.|$|E

This statement is then followed by a PowerPoint presentation that begins with M&M’s and ends with round, pink bungalows on paradisiacal Malaysian beaches.

Concepts originate from a state of self-in icted despair in which design needs to be justi ed point by point, and architecture by de nition has no cultural relevance.
