40|$|PowerPoint {{presentation}} [URL] April 2009, the Department of Health in England {{implemented the}} NHS Health <b>Check</b> <b>Programme.</b> NHS Health <b>Check</b> {{is a national}} risk assessment and management programme for those aged 40 to 74 living in England, {{who do not have}} an existing vascular disease, and who are not currently being treated for certain risk factors. It is aimed at preventing heart disease, stroke, diabetes and kidney disease and raising awareness of dementia for those aged 65 - 74. Patients identified as having preclinical symptoms of disease are referred for formal diagnosis and enter established care pathways. The remainder of the population is managed within the programme, either with a brief lifestyle intervention or signposting to local services for more intensive intervention. (1) The programme aims to reduce health inequalities associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). (2) The NHS Health <b>Check</b> <b>programme</b> is delivered through contracts with service providers such as general practices and community providers. Whereas general practices offer the vast majority of their Health Checks by appointments, community providers offer opportunistic checks. (3) Between 2008 and 2013, PCT public health commissioners commissioned community providers using Health Options® software and Point of Care Testing (POCT) to deliver the Health <b>Check</b> <b>Programme</b> in pharmacies, community settings and businesses. These providers were commissioned to conduct Health Checks with the aim of reducing health inequalities by targeting more deprived individuals and more ethnic minorities. In 2013, Public Health England reasserted their commitment to strengthening the programme in deprived communities and among ethnic minorities. (4) There has been no national study assessing the impact of delivering the Health <b>Check</b> <b>programme</b> with community providers. The current analysis examined the effectiveness of community providers in targeting ethnic minorities and deprived communities. The analysis is based on a comparison of patient level data collected by outreach providers to the general population data in 8 regions of England across 29 local authorities (LAs). Target population included 41, 570 individuals who received a Health Check carried out by community providers from the January 30 2008 to October 31, 2013. Office for National Statistics Census (2011) data was used as a reference for comparative analyses at the local authority level. Department for Communities and Local Government, Indices of Deprivation 2010 was used as a reference for comparative analysis of deprivation. Delivering the NHS Health <b>Check</b> <b>Programme</b> with community providers using Health Options® software and Point of Care Testing (POCT) allowed for community services to be integrated more closely with primary care. Unlike the standard data gathering systems in general practices used to deliver the Health Checks (e. g. EMIS, INPS-Vision, TPP-SystmOne), Health Options® software was developed specifically for the purpose of carrying out the Health <b>Check</b> <b>programme.</b> It was designed to enable a range of healthcare professionals to use it while communicating personalised CVD risk information to the patient. Technological innovation resulted in patient centred care when risk lowering scenarios were presented to the patient. Same day testing using POCT allowed for CVD risk to be communicated to the patient on the same day and minimised the loss to follow up observed in general practices lacking POCT devices. Health Checks results obtained by community providers were communicated to general practices. The mean IMD 2010 score across 29 LAs was 5. 98 higher at p< 0. 05 compared to general population data using two sample t-tests. Twenty two of the 29 LAs were significantly more deprived at p< 0. 05 compared to the general population. Across the 29 LAs, no statistically significant difference was obtained in the mean proportion of ethnic minorities. The mean proportion of men was 11. 3...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the implementation of}} the National Health Service (NHS) Health <b>Check</b> <b>programme</b> in one area of England from the perspective of general practitioners (GPs). DESIGN: A qualitative exploratory study was conducted with GPs and other healthcare professionals involved in delivering the NHS Health Check and with patients. This paper reports the experience of GPs and focuses on the management of the Heath <b>Check</b> <b>programme</b> in primary care. SETTING: Primary care surgeries in the Heart of Birmingham region (now {{under the auspices of the}} Birmingham Cross City Clinical Commissioning Group) were invited to take part in the larger scale evaluation. This study focuses on a subset of those surgeries whose GPs were willing to participate. PARTICIPANTS: 9 GPs from different practices volunteered. GPs served an ethnically diverse region with areas of socioeconomic deprivation. Ethnicities of participant GPs included South Asian, South Asian British, white, black British and Chinese. METHODS: Individual semistructured interviews were conducted with GPs face to face or via telephone. Thematic analysis was used to analyse verbatim transcripts. RESULTS: Themes were generated which represent GPs' experiences of managing the NHS Health Check: primary care as a commercial enterprise; 'buy in' to concordance in preventive healthcare; following protocol and support provision. These themes represent the key issues raised by GPs. They reveal variability in the implementation of NHS Health Checks. GPs also need support in allocating resources to the Health Check including training on how to conduct checks in a concordant (or collaborative) way. CONCLUSIONS: The variability observed in this small-scale evaluation corroborates existing findings suggesting a need for more standardisation. Further large-scale research is needed to determine how that could be achieved. Work needs to be done to further develop a concordant approach to lifestyle advice which involves tailored individual goal setting rather than a paternalistic advice-giving model...|$|R

In England, one manifestation {{of this has been}} the launch of the National Health Service Health <b>Check</b> <b>programme.</b> This paper reports findings from a small-scale qualitative study exploring experiences of engaging with a community-based health check in Knowsley, England, among 17 males and 19 females, with varying levels of risk for cardiovascular disease, who agreed to be contacted for the purpose of research at the time they underwent their check. Analysis revealed that the community-based nature of the checks provided opportunities for people {{to find out more about}} their health who might not otherwise have done so. Participants expressed a range of responses to the communication of the risk score, often revealing their confusion about its meaning. Changes in behaviour were identified, which participants connected with having had a check. This study raises questions about where, how and by whom health checks are delivered. Emphasis on health checks reflects the dominant individualist ideology, but this study also suggests that the process provides opportunities to enable and empower individuals, albeit in small ways. However, they remain a ‘downstream’ approach to public health, emphasizing medical and behavioural options for risk factor reduction rather than focussing on primary prevention through changes to the wider environment. Furthermore, although developed as a central feature of the UK's strategy to reduce health inequalities, health checks may widen them...|$|R
40|$|The Public Health England (PHE) {{paper by}} Waterall et al. is strong on good {{intentions}} but weak on evidence. In truth, the NHS Health <b>Checks</b> <b>programme</b> is a failure.

Introduction We {{agree that the}} burden of premature cardiovascular disease and death is enormous, inequitable and potentially preventable. We also strongly agree that population-wide measures can be powerful, rapid, equitable and cost saving. We therefore commend the PHE emphasis on policies such as salt reduction, five a day, smoke-free legislation, plain packaging, alcohol MUP and inequalities. Sadly, these aims are effectively upstaged by the continuing PHE emphasis on NHS Health Checks (NHSHC). That downstream strategy fails conceptually, scientifically, economically and practically.

40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{complying}} to EUROSTAT standards, {{two years}} ago ISTAT began to design a new labour force survey. After an experimental phase, the survey is now being run in parallel with the current one and will substitute it completely during 2004. Innovations in the new survey concerned both contents and technical aspects. In particular, concerning the survey technique, we passed from a PAPI technique handled by interviewers of the municipalities which entered the sample, to a mixed technique: CAPI for the first family interviews and CATI for the confirmation interviews following the first. The questionnaire for the new survey is particularly complex and consists in a general opening part which collects information on the family’s demographic characteristics and 12 sections of which 10 are repeated for each family member. The use of an electronic questionnaire has allowed for automatic branching, the activation of online help upon request of the interviewer, the interactive coding of open items using a search engine for certain key variables (such as economic activity and profession), the introduction of soft and hard control mechanisms of range and coherence (with the possibility of conciliating on the spot), managing confirmation items for waves following the first. All of this has helped simplify the interview and therefore significantly improve data quality. To evaluate such improvement, we have compared the off-line <b>check</b> <b>programme</b> of the old survey with the on-line <b>check</b> <b>programme</b> of the new survey, analysing the number of partial non-responses, the number of edit activations, the number of conciliations in the new survey {{and the number of}} soft controls purposefully not corrected (which shouldn’t therefore be imputed automatically). The significantly better results for the new survey have confirmed the correctness of the choice of an electronic questionnaire as data collection instrument. Comparisons between the qualitative standards of the two surveys will be developed in order to analyse longitudinal aspects of the sample, examining in detail the effects of a confirmation questionnaire in the waves following the first and the use of a CATI technique...|$|R

40|$|Background The NHS Health <b>Check</b> <b>programme</b> is a {{prevention}} initiative offering cardiovascular {{risk assessment}} and management advice to adults aged 40 – 74 years across England. Its effectiveness depends on uptake. When {{it was introduced}} in 2009, it was anticipated that all those eligible would be invited over a 5 -year cycle and 75 % of those invited would attend. So far in the current cycle from 2013 to 2018, 33. 8 % of those eligible have attended, which is equal to 48. 5 % of those invited to attend. Understanding the reasons why some people do not attend is important to maximise {{the impact of the}} programmes. Aim To review why people do not attend NHS Health Checks. Design and setting A systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies. Method An electronic literature search was carried out of MEDLINE, Embase, Health Management Information Consortium, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Global Health, PsycINFO, Web of Science, OpenGrey, the Cochrane Library, NHS Evidence, Google Scholar, Google, ClinicalTrials. gov, and the ISRCTN registry from 1 January 1996 to 9 November 2016, and the reference lists of all included papers were also screened manually. Inclusion criteria were primary research studies that reported the views of people who were eligible for but had not attended an NHS Health Check. Results Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Reasons for not attending included lack of awareness or knowledge, misunderstanding the purpose of the NHS Health Check, aversion to preventive medicine, time constraints, difficulties with access to general practices, and doubts regarding pharmacies as appropriate settings.

40|$|The NHS Health Check is a {{national}} screening programme targeting cardiovascular disease (CVD), {{the leading cause of}} death in the UK. Effectiveness of the NHS Health Check is still under evaluation and no randomised controlled trial (RCT) has been undertaken to date. Current research results are largely inconclusive. Initially low, programme uptake has been increasing in recent years, reaching nationally up to half of the eligible population. While the research data gives a mixed picture, concerns have been raised about differential uptake among different demographic groups, including those living in more deprived areas.

40|$|Background The NHS Health <b>Check</b> <b>programme</b> is {{the largest}} current {{prevention}} initiative in England. Since its introduction in 2009 a growing literature has been published evaluating the first eight years of the programme. These have been summarised in reports published by Public Health England but, to date, no synthesis has been performed. There is, therefore, a need for an independent, comprehensive, rapid evidence synthesis to identify what has been learnt about the NHS Health <b>Check</b> <b>programme</b> so far. Aims and Objectives To provide a rapid synthesis of the published research evidence on NHS Health Checks, specifically addressing the six research questions posed by Public Health England: 1. Who is and who is not having an NHS Health Check? 2. What are the factors that increase take-up among the population and sub-groups? 3. Why do people not take up an offer of an NHS Health Check? 4. How is primary care managing people identified as being at risk of cardiovascular disease or with abnormal risk factor results? 5. What are patients’ experiences of having an NHS Health Check? 6. What {{is the effect of}} the NHS Health Check on disease detection, changing behaviours, referrals to local risk management services, reductions in individual risk factor prevalence, reducing cardiovascular disease risk and on statin and antihypertensive prescribing? Design A systematic review with descriptive synthesis of quantitative data and thematic synthesis of qualitative data. Data sources Medline, PubMed, Embase, Health Management Information Consortium (HMIC), Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Global Health, PsycInfo, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, NHS Evidence, Google Scholar, Google, OpenGrey, Clinical Trials. gov, the ISRCTN registry, and article reference lists. Study selection Studies identified by the searches were selected for inclusion in the review by two reviewers in a two-step process. First, studies relevant to the NHS Health Check were identified. These were then screened against predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria for each of the six research questions. Data extraction At least two researchers assessed eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the included studies. 9 Key findings Coverage varies substantially across regions and in different settings. Multiple definitions used interchangeably make comparisons difficult. It is consistently higher in older people, females and more deprived populations but this may reflect targeting.

40|$|Background There were {{concerns}} that robust evaluation {{of national public}} health programmes delivered locally was not being done, resulting in a lack of evidence to demonstrate the impact of programmes. Methods A qualitative field study drawing on ethnographic approaches was carried out over 18 months in a Public Health department in a UK Primary Care Trust. Interview and observation data from 16 participants of varying roles and experience involved in implementing the NHS Health <b>Check</b> <b>programme</b> including programme documentary data was analysed using the constant comparative method to understand how evaluation was perceived and conducted in practice. Results Participants' informal evaluation definitions encompassed different activities that formed {{an integral part of}} assessing the progress of the programme’s delivery and implementation. Formal evaluation was defined as the processes required to produce reports for official scrutiny, demonstrate compliance with official targets, and provide evidence that programmes are delivered. Organisational structures, resources and expectations were instrumental in determining how evaluation was conducted. Evaluation in practice was observed to be predominantly retrospective, unstructured and focused on generating descriptive information about the programme's processes and progress. Participants devised their own multi-purpose and diverse evaluation procedures to meet personal, professional and organisational obligations to demonstrate success in some form. Conclusion Limited use of recognised public health evaluation methodologies at local level was due to a mixture of operational, political and personal factors, including the desire to show success. The purpose of evaluation was to provide information to justify policy and financial decisions and to preserve services and jobs. Therefore the political and organisational structures and arrangements need to be in place to enable public health professionals to conduct robust evidence to deliver critical findings. ...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: High and {{equitable}} coverage of systematic cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention programmes, {{such as the}} NHS Health <b>Check</b> <b>programme</b> in England, is essential {{if they are to}} effectively reduce the population CVD burden. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from 151 English primary care trusts (PCTs) on NHS Health Check coverage during 2011 - 12. We examined the associations between programme coverage and primary care and population factors, including patient demographics, primary care workforce and cardiovascular health need. RESULTS: Median coverage of NHS Health Checks was 8. 2 %, with wide PCT-level variation (range = 0 - 29. 8 %). Coverage was significantly higher in PCTs in the most deprived areas compared with the least deprived (P = 0. 035), adjusting for covariates. Significant negative associations between coverage and a higher proportion of PCT population aged 40 - 74 years-the eligible Health Check age group, a larger total population size and higher practice staffing levels were found in the unadjusted analyses. CONCLUSIONS: NHS Health Check coverage during 2011 - 12 was lower than the government projection of 18 % coverage. Coverage must be increased through concerted multi-disciplinary strategies, for the programme to improve cardiovascular health in England. Considerable variation in participation between PCTs warrants attention, with enhanced support for poor performers...|$|R
40|$|Background The NHS Health Check Programmewas {{introduced}} in 2009 to improve primary prevention of coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes and chronic kidney disease; however, {{there has been}} debate regarding the impact. We present a retrospective evaluation of Leicester City Clinical Commissioning Group. Methods Data are reported on diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, high risk of type 2 diabetes and high risk of cardiovascular disease. Data on management following the Health Check are also reported. Results Over a 5 -year period, 53 799 health checks were performed, 16 388 (30 %) people were diagnosed {{with at least one}} condition when diagnosis of being at high risk of cardiovascular disease was defined as 20 %. This figure increased to 43 %when diagnosis of high cardiovascular risk 10 %was included. Of the 3063 (5. 7 %) individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, 54 %were prescribed metformin and 26 %were referred for structured education. Of the 5797 (10. 8 %) individuals diagnosed at high risk of cardiovascular disease (20 %), 64 % were prescribed statins.

40|$|Background: High {{levels of}} {{sedentary}} behaviour {{have a negative}} impact on health and well-being. There is limited evidence on the prevalence and correlates of sedentary behaviour of adults with intellectual disabilities (ID). Methods: A population-based sample of adults with ID were invited to take part in a comprehensive health <b>check</b> <b>programme.</b> Demographic and health data were collected during a structured interview and physical examination. Screen time was used as a proxy measure of sedentary behaviour. Bivariate and multivariate statistical modelling examined correlates of screen time. Results: Fifty per cent of the 725 participants reported four or more hours of screen time per day. Male gender, higher levels of intellectual ability, mobility problems, obesity, not having hearing impairment and not having epilepsy were all significantly associated with higher screen time in the final multivariate model (R 2 = 0. 16; Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness of fit statistic P = 0. 36). Conclusions: This is the first study to publish population-based data on the prevalence and correlates of sedentary behaviour in adults with ID. Compared with adults who do not have ID, adults with ID have higher levels, and different correlates, of sedentary behaviour. A better understanding of the social context of sedentary behaviour will inform the design of effective behaviour change programmes for adults with ID...|$|R
40|$|Background. The NHS Health <b>Check</b> <b>programme</b> aims {{to improve}} prevention, early {{diagnosis}} {{and management of}} cardiovascular disease (CVD) in England. High and equitable uptake {{is essential for the}} programme to effectively reduce the CVD burden. Objectives. Assessing the impact of a local financial incentive scheme on uptake and statin pre-scribing in the first 2  years of the programme. Methods. Cross-sectional study using data from electronic medical records of general practices in Hammersmith and Fulham, London on all patients aged 40 – 74  years. We assessed uptake of complete Health Check, exclusion of patients from the programme (exception reporting) and statin prescriptions in patients confirmed with high CVD risk. Results. The Health Check uptake was 32. 7 % in Year 1 and 20. 0 % in Year 2.  Older patients had higher uptake of Health Check than younger (65 - to 74 -year-old patients: Year 1 adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2. 05 (1. 67 – 2. 52) & Year 2 AOR 2. 79 (2. 49 – 3. 12) compared with 40 - to 54 -year-old patients). The percentage of confirmed high risk patients prescribed a statin was 17. 7 % before and 52. 9 % after the programme. There was a marked variation in Health Check uptake, exception reporting and statin prescribing between practices...|$|R
40|$|Aims/hypothesis: Health <b>check</b> <b>programmes</b> {{for chronic}} disease have been {{introduced}} {{in a number of}} countries. However, there are few trials assessing the benefits and harms of these screening programmes at the population level. In a post hoc analysis, we evaluated the effect of population-based screening for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors on mortality rates and cardiovascular events. Methods: This register-based, non-randomised, controlled trial included men and women aged 40 - 69 years without known diabetes who were registered with a general practice in Denmark (n = 1, 912, 392). Between 2001 and 2006, 153, 107 individuals registered with 181 practices participating in the Anglo-Danish-Dutch Study of Intensive Treatment in People with Screen-Detected Diabetes in Primary Care (ADDITION) -Denmark study were sent a diabetes risk score questionnaire. Individuals at moderate-to-high risk were invited to visit their GP for assessment of diabetes status and cardiovascular risk (screening group). The 1, 759, 285 individuals registered with all other general practices in Denmark constituted the retrospectively constructed no-screening (control) group. Outcomes were mortality rate and cardiovascular events (cardiovascular disease death, non-fatal ischaemic heart disease or stroke). The analysis was performed according to the intention-to-screen principle. Results: Among the screening group, 27, 177 (18...|$|R
40|$|Background As part of {{national}} policy {{to manage the}} increasing burden of chronic diseases, the Department of Health in England has launched the NHS Health <b>Checks</b> <b>programme,</b> which aims to reduce {{the burden of the}} major vascular diseases on the health service. Methods A cross-sectional review of response, attendance and treatment uptake over {{the first year of the}} programme in Stoke on Trent was carried out. Patients aged between 32 and 74 years and estimated to be at 20 % risk of developing cardiovascular disease were identified from electronic medical records. Multi-level regression modelling was used to evaluate the influence of individual- and practice-level factors on health check outcomes. Results Overall 63. 3 % of patients responded, 43. 7 % attended and 29. 8 % took up a treatment following their health check invitation. The response was higher for older age and more affluent areas; attendance and treatment uptake were higher for males and older age. Variance between practices was significant (P, 0. 001) for response (13. 4 %), attendance (12. 7 %) and uptake (23 %). Conclusions The attendance rate of 43. 7 % following invitation to a health check was considerably lower than the benchmark of 75 %. The lack of public interest and the prevalence of significant comorbidity are challenges to this national policy innovation...|$|R
40|$|The UK Department of Health {{introduced}} the National Health Service (NHS) Health <b>Check</b> <b>Programme</b> in April 2009 {{in an attempt}} to improve primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in the UK population and to reduce health inequalities. Healthcare professionals' attitudes towards giving lifestyle advice will influence how they interact with patients during consultations. We therefore sought to identify the attitudes of primary care healthcare professionals towards the delivery of lifestyle advice {{in the context of the}} NHS Health Check Programme.; Fifty-two primary care healthcare professionals undertook a Q sort with 36 statements that represented a range of viewpoints about the importance of lifestyle change, medication, giving lifestyle advice in the primary care setting, and the individual, social and material factors that might impact on lifestyle related behaviour change. Sorts were analysed by-person using principal components analysis and varimax rotation.; Five statistically independent factors (accounts) reflected distinct views on the topic. Account 1 was supportive of initiatives like the NHS Health Check, and emphasised the importance of professionals working collaboratively with patients to facilitate lifestyle change. Account 2 expressed views on the potential overuse of statin medication and placed responsibility for lifestyle change with the patient. Account 3 viewed the healthcare professional role to be one of educator, emphasising the provision of information. Account 4 perceived lifestyle change to be difficult for patients and emphasised the need for healthcare professionals to be role models. Account 5 was inconsistent about the value of lifestyle change, or the role of healthcare professionals in promoting it, a finding that may be due to ambivalence about the health check or to lack of engagement with the Q sort task. We found no strong associations between any of the factors and, gender, role, age or ethnicity.; Our findings suggest that healthcare professionals hold viewpoints that may influence how they interact with patients during health <b>checks.</b> When implementing <b>programmes</b> like the NHS Health Check, it would be useful to take healthcare professionals’ views into account. Attitudes and beliefs could be explored during training sessions, for example...|$|R
