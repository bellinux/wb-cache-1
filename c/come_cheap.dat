Allmusic writer Ned Raggett, {{who gave the}} album 4 out of 5 stars and selected the album as the site's Album Pick, wrote, [...] "album arguably beats out the fine debut Heavy Load—there's something even more belligerent, raunchy, and fiery about Furlow and Laws this time out."

The FitzWilliam family were first recorded in Ireland about 1210, and by the seventeenth century had become among the largest landowners in Dublin. They had a record of loyalty to the English Crown, and the viscountcy was conferred on Thomas in 1629 by Charles I in recognition of his good services. The title did not <b>come</b> <b>cheap</b> since the Crown expected financial help in return, and the estates were mortgaged in the 1630s {{to cover the cost}} of the family's gifts to the Crown.|$|E

The San Diego Union-Tribune writer Jeff Niesel described New Kingdom's music as a cross between Wu-Tang Clan and the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, while Allmusic's Bret Love compared the group to Beastie Boys and Onyx. The New York Times writer Jon Pareles compared New Kingdom to rap-rock fusions by artists such as Run-D.M.C., Public Enemy, Anthrax, Cypress Hill, and Wu-Tang Clan. In his review of Paradise Don't <b>Come</b> <b>Cheap,</b> Allmusic writer Ned Raggett wrote, [...] "group's sound compares with a Goodie Mob/Bubba Sparxxx collaboration produced by the RZA—or, say, Eminem's [...] "Square Dance" [...] completely gone to hell—well before its time" [...] {{and concluded that the}} only easy comparison between New Kingdom and another musical act is Wu-Tang Clan.|$|E

5000|$|Nicks is {{not only}} a musical icon, but also {{recognized}} for her unique style. Her style has remained the same throughout her years in the spotlight and even [...] "at 60 she is still working the gossamer tunics and shawls that have influenced two generations of Stevie acolytes, and given her performances the feel of a Wiccan ritual" [...] writes New York Times reporter Ruth La Ferla. Nicks has been known for her multiple wardrobe changes during live performances, almost having a new outfit for each song she sang. Her unique look—including lots of chiffon hanging from her body—was part of her trademark look. The cost to keep up her overall style, of hair, makeup, and wardrobe, did not <b>come</b> <b>cheap.</b> Nicks filed tax deductible expenses in 1991 costing [...] "$12,495 for makeup and hairstyling and $43,291 for professional clothing and maintenance" [...] alone.|$|E

5000|$|As remodeled, Parker House was emphatically {{a summer}} home - Clough's French windows were not {{designed}} to keep out winter chills - but was also conceived as {{a place in the}} country. Inspired by the House and Garden Movement, in the fashion of the day Mrs. Merrill kept a Jersey cow and laying hens, unthinkable on Parker Point where the family had previously summered. She also cultivated gladiolus in her garden, entering them at the annual Blue Hill Fair, and, in the spirit of agricultural improvement then abroad in the land, engaged Frederick Vernon Coville, the developer of the modern Highbush Blueberry, to plant a number of his early cultivars on the property. (His services did not <b>come</b> <b>cheap.</b> According to her granddaughter's recollections, Mrs. Merrill would sometimes say to guests to whom she served any, [...] "Did you enjoy the berries? They cost me a nickel apiece.") Fashionable too were her artistic pursuits. The house contains two oil still-lives and a set of hand-painted Limoges china as well as examples of her needlepoint.|$|E
5000|$|Plant Dolls {{are living}} dolls. They drink milk warmed to body {{temperature}} {{three times a}} day, and take sugar cookies or cake once a week as fertilizer. Each doll is unique, though the same [...] "model" [...] can be available. They are [...] "so expensive the price will make your eyeballs pop out," [...] and the accessories and care do not <b>come</b> <b>cheap</b> either. Plant Dolls look like young girls, but given improper treatment, they can mature. This is especially true if they are given anything to eat or drink other than milk and cookies. When they cry, their tears become valuable jewels called [...] "Tears of Heaven". Plant Dolls are shown to have very lovely smiles, often deeply touching those who see them. There are two known models of Plant Dolls: potpourri dolls and singing dolls. Potpourri dolls take perfume balls with their meals and soon a pleasant scent can come from them. One of the earliest known singing dolls was Olympia, but she was later deemed an irregular model because she wasn't nourished for over a week but stayed the same way.|$|E
50|$|A {{large room}} at the Golden Duck tavernAfter bustle of {{travellers}} departing, Madame Bardeau is seen entertaining the curé. She owes money to Lavatte, the richest (and meanest) man in the town. While explaining all this, she sees a porter loading luggage belonging {{to a group of}} strolling players who owe her money. The curé agrees to intercede with Lavatte if she will be generous with the players.Lavatte enters and announces that he is giving a party that night to mark the engagement of his daughter Madeleine to a local nobleman (who it turns out is too old to become her husband). The curé suggests that Lavatte gets the players to entertain his guests that night - they will <b>come</b> <b>cheap</b> if he agrees to allow Madame Bardeau to have more time to pay her debt.The curé is joined by Hector, a young poet on his way to Paris, and when the curé has left and Madeleine enters in search of her father, it becomes clear that the two young people are falling in love. When Lavatte returns he angrily takes Madeleine away, closely followed by Hector.The players enter: Mercury (their dancer), Venus, Diana, Mars, Bacchus and Jupiter, the manager of the troupe. Diana is fed up with the roving life and wants a change, but Jupiter reminds them that down the centuries they have known many hardships and must stick together. Hector enters and stands them all wine, and when Lavatte comes in they offer to perform their ‘Comedy of Olympus’. Lavatte drives a hard bargain with them before leaving, but refuses to allow Hector to come to the party.The players become animated and jubilant, while Hector declares his love for Madeleine, and Madame Bardeau complains about all the noise.|$|E
