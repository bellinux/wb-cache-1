6000|$|... [1] Since {{these words}} were written I {{have seen the}} cone move. In the {{presence}} of another medium, with {{no one in the}} room but myself, I held the psychic's hands what time the horn <b>circled</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> It shone like a golden rod as it moved. I could see the gleam of light along its entire side. At last it came softly down and laid itself across my shoulder. In order to satisfy myself of its presence, I bent and touched it with my forehead. The touch seemed to disturb conditions, to break the current, for it dropped instantly to the floor. Twice it answered to my request in this manner until my doubts were satisfied. It seemed to move with the swiftness of a dragonfly as silent and horizontal it hung in the air about <b>my</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|This {{commission}} {{filled me}} {{with the spirit of}} the soldier. Proudly walking my rounds I menaced the flocks as they <b>circled</b> warily <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> taking shot at them now and again as they came near enough, feeling as duty bound and as martial as any Roman sentry standing guard over a city. Up to this time I had not been allowed to carry arms, although I had been the companion of Den Green and Ellis Usher on their hunting expeditions in the coulee--now with entire discretion <b>over</b> <b>my</b> weapon, I loaded it, capped it and fired it, marching with sedate and manly tread, while little Frank at my heels, served as subordinate in his turn.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the morning}} I watched the geese {{from the door}} through the mist, sailing {{in the middle of}} the pond, fifty rods off, so large and tumultuous that Walden {{appeared}} like an artificial pond for their amusement. But when I stood on the shore they at once rose up with a great flapping of wings at the signal of their commander, and when they had got into rank <b>circled</b> about <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> twenty-nine of them, and then steered straight to Canada, with a regular honk from the leader at intervals, trusting to break their fast in muddier pools. A [...] "plump" [...] of ducks rose at the same time and took the route to the north in the wake of their noisier cousins.|$|R
