In this study 27, 639 records of both birth weight (BW) and weaning weight (WW) from the Asturiana de los Valles breed were used to assess the consequences of the inclusion of an <b>s</b> <b>effect</b> on the estimation of genetic parameters for BW, WW and average daily gain (ADG) fitting univariate and bivariate models. Estimations of s 2 for BW, WWand ADG were 0. 040, 0. 070 and 0. 077 regardless of the fitted model. Inclusion of s in the estimation models induced a reduction of both the direct and the maternal heritability, varying between 8 and 28 % with the trait and the estimation model employed. As expected, the correlations between both direct and maternal genetic effects for each trait were less negative when s was included in the estimation model. The estimated correlations between the <b>s</b> <b>effect</b> affecting BW, WW and ADG were 0. 108, 0. 038 and 0. 616 for the pairs BW–WW, BW–ADG and WW–ADG, respectively.

40|$|The Orion {{crew module}} (CM) is being {{designed}} to perform survivable {{land and water}} landings. There are many issues associated with post-landing crew survival. In general, the most challenging of the realistic Orion landing scenarios from an environmental control standpoint is the off-nominal water landing. Available power and other consumables will be very limited after landing, {{and it may not}} be possible to provide full environmental control within the crew cabin for very long after splashdown. Given the bulk and thermal insulation characteristics of the crew-worn pressure suits, landing in a warm tropical ocean area would pose a risk to crew survival from elevated core body temperatures, if for some reason the crewmembers were not able to remove their suits and/or exit the vehicle.

40|$|Rationale and objective: Sufficiently {{high doses}} of β-phenylethylamine (β-PEA), a trace amine that is rapidly metabolized by monoamine oxidase-type B (MAO-B), can produce effects {{comparable}} to those of cocaine or methamphetamine (MA). The present experiments were conducted to study how the discriminative-stimulus (S D) and reinforcing-stimulus (<b>S</b> R) <b>effects</b> of β-PEA in monkeys are modified by treatment with inhibitors of MAO-B [R-(–) -deprenyl and MDL 72974]. Methods and results: In studies of its <b>S</b> D <b>effects,</b> doses of β-PEA up to 30 mg/kg engendered only sporadic responding on the drug-associated lever in squirrel monkeys that discriminated intramuscular injections of 0. 3 mg/kg MA from vehicle whereas lower doses of 0. 3 – 1. 0 mg/kg β-PEA produced full substitution when administered after either R-(–) -deprenyl or MDL 72974 (0. 3 mg/kg). The MA-like <b>S</b> D <b>effects</b> of β-PEA were attenuated by either dopamine D 1 or D 2 receptor blockers. In studies of its <b>S</b> R <b>effects,</b> {{high doses of}} β-PEA maintained responding in two of three monkeys under a second-order fixed-interval schedule (3. 0 or 10 mg/kg per injection) and two of three monkeys under a simple fixed ratio (FR) schedule (0. 3 – 1. 0 mg/kg per injection) of intravenous (i. v.) self-administration. MAO-B inhibition by R-(–) -deprenyl or MDL 72974 enhanced the <b>S</b> R <b>effects</b> of β-PEA in all monkeys and, under the FR schedule, induced a 30 -fold or greater leftward shift in the dose-response function for its i. v. self-administration. Based on time-course determinations, the enhanced <b>S</b> R <b>effects</b> of β-PEA under the FR schedule were long-lasting and dissipated gradually over 3 – 7 days. Conclusions: These results show that inhibition of MAO-B enhances S D and <b>S</b> R <b>effects</b> of β-PEA in monkeys, presumably by delaying its inactivation. MAO-B inhibition leading to increased levels of β-PEA may be useful, alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents, in the pharmacological management of selected aspects of drug dependence...|$|R
