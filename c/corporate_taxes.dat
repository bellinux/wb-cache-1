5|$|Taxes in the United States are levied at the federal, state, {{and local}} {{government}} levels. These include taxes on income, payroll, property, sales, imports, estates and gifts, as well as various fees. In 2010 taxes collected by federal, state and municipal governments amounted to 24.8% of GDP. During FY2012, the federal government collected approximately $2.45 trillion in tax revenue, up $147 billion or 6% versus FY2011 revenues of $2.30 trillion. Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,132B or 47%), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($845B or 35%), and <b>corporate</b> <b>taxes</b> ($242B or 10%). Based on CBO estimates, under 2013 tax law the top 1% will be paying the highest average tax rates since 1979, while other income groups will remain at historic lows.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Chandler took office, {{it became}} clear that he could not fund the social {{programs}} initiated by Clements and Wetherby, plus Chandler's own proposed programs, with the revenue presently being brought into the state treasury. He cut the popular Youth Authority, initiated by Wetherby to unify the state's children's welfare programs, but the savings were not enough to balance the budget. In order to deliver on his campaign promises, Chandler ignored the budget during the regular legislative session in 1956, then called a special session during which he presented his budget proposal. The proposal called for spending in excess of $46million more than officials estimated would be brought into the state's coffers over the two-year budget. Chandler convinced legislators to pass the budget, promising to propose a tax plan to pay for the expenditures in a subsequent special session. The promised package added 150,000 citizens to the state's tax rolls, put a surtax on income taxes, and cut tax credits. It created a new 5 percent production tax on whisky, and added taxes to deeds and life insurance premiums. It increased the state gasoline tax for trucks by two cents per gallon and raised <b>corporate</b> <b>taxes</b> by half a percent. In addition, it transferred the assessment and collection of taxes on certain intangibles from local to state government. The plan also called for a $100million bond issue, allowing the allocation of generous budgets for state universities and colleges and improvements to the state highway system.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{discussion}} of <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> reduction is hot political issue in Japan. Especially, some researchers and politicians {{insist on the}} reduction of <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> rate, following the fact of "Corporate tax paradox", which means that <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> revenue per Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has a negative correlation with effective <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> rate. However, quantitative effect of <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> reduction is unclear and the {{discussion of}} finance methods does not proceed. Therefore, we examine the quantitative effect of <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> reduction to employment, output and total tax revenue which {{is the cost of}} tax reduction. To analyze the effect of <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> reduction, we use Dynamic General Equilibrium (DGE) model and we use shooting algorithm to calculate the large <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> reduction (i. e. 5 % or 20 % <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> rate reduction). As a result, long-run effect of <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> reduction not only prompts to economic growth, but also increases total tax revenue, when financed by lump-sum transfer. Because current <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> rate is the right hand side of the Laffer curve. With respect to the magnitude of tax reduction, absolute impact of 20 % reduction is much larger than that of 5 %. But relative impact (i. e. multiplier effect of tax reduction) of 20 % reduction is a little smaller than that of 5 %. However, short-run effect is smaller than long-run one. In the short-run, since capital accumulation is insufficient, households decrease consumption and tax revenue. ...|$|R

In order to assess the outcome of <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> competition as it is reflected by the firms’ behavioural responses, a panel data for EU countries was used.

40|$|Abstract: Over {{the past}} two decades there has been a {{worldwide}} fall in statutory <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> rates. Focusing on Australia, this article establishes three empirical facts which challenge much of the existing literature. First, <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> competition was the crucial driving force behind <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> cuts. Second, policymakers had to abandon tax related investment incentives in order to pay for lower <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> rates. This broadening of the <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> base is costly, because it potentially disadvantages domestic firms and may, over the longer term, erode the <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> base. Third, <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> cuts have put pressure on the personal income tax base, as low <b>corporate</b> rates provide <b>tax</b> avoidance opportunities for high-income earners. Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Brett Freudenberg and two anonymous reviewers for their very helpful comments and Miro Bogner for able research assistance. Remaining errors are our responsibility. An earlier version of this article was presented to the 2003 Australasian Political Studies Association Conference. ...|$|R
40|$|Unlike {{developed}} countries, <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> {{rather than}} personal tax revenues are the greater source of public finance for {{less developed countries}} (LDCs). This paper analyses the <b>corporate</b> income <b>tax</b> policy for a large panel of LDCs over the period 1980 – 2006. The analysis shows that although the <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> rate has been decreasing in LDCs, <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> revenues have been increasing {{as a percentage of}} total tax revenues and GDP. Contrary to standard tax competition theory, there is also strong evidence that <b>corporate</b> income <b>taxes</b> in LDCs are increasing in the country’s openness as measured by capital mobility. The analysis also shows that the <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> rate is increasing in the personal tax rate as income-shifting theory predicts. However this has not translated into increased <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> revenues. Of equal interest is the lack of evidence of a relationship between the LDC’s government revenue needs and its <b>corporate</b> <b>tax</b> rate...|$|R
