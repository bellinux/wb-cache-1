40|$|Abstract—To {{estimate}} {{the effect of}} high repetition frequency laser jamming on laser seeker’s distinguishing and locking stage for decoding process, two models are built to quantitatively study the jamming effect under the different coding systems, one is normalized cross-correlation function model, the other is jamming efficiency model. The simulation result indicates that, at the stage of code distinguishing, the jamming frequency is a dominant factor in affecting the jamming effect; The effect of high repetition frequency laser jamming seeker under the different coding system is different; The greater the seeker sampling interval is, the better the effect is. At the stage of <b>code</b> <b>locking,</b> the leading time of high repetition frequency laser to guidance signal {{is an important factor}} in affecting the jamming efficiency; The higher the jamming frequency and the wider the time gate’s width is, the higher the average efficiency of interference is. High repetition frequency laser can completely jam the decoding process of the two stages when the laser frequency is high enough.

The portable hard-disk encryption/decryption system is composed of the authentication module, the USB portable hard-disk interface card, the ATA protocol command decoder module, the data encryption/decryption module, the cipher key management module, the MEMS <b>coded</b> <b>lock</b> controlling circuit module, the MEMS <b>coded</b> <b>lock</b> and the hard disk.

40|$|Abstract—Code {{tracking}} {{linear range}} and the code phase tracking jitter {{have always been}} opposing ends of the design criteria of a <b>code</b> <b>lock</b> loop in direct-sequence spread-spectrum communication systems. New modulation techniques used in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) offer better code tracking jitter and multipath performance by sharpening the correlation triangle. However the linear tracking range is reduced which directly results in poor dynamics and low signal strength performance of the tracking loop. The problem is most severe in the sophisticated Alternate Binary Offset Carrier (AltBOC) modulation. This paper proposes a method to extend a loop’s tracking range without affecting the jitter performance in the existing linear range of the code tracking loop.

40|$|The {{past few}} years have marked {{the start of a}} {{historic}} transition from sequential to parallel computation. The necessity to write parallel programs is increasing as systems are getting more complex while processor speed increases are slowing down. Current parallel programming uses low-level programming constructs like threads and explicit synchronization using locks to coordinate thread execution. Parallel programs written with these constructs are difficult to design, program and debug. Also locks have many drawbacks which make them a suboptimal solution. One such drawback is that locks should be only used to enclose the critical section of the parallel-processing <b>code.</b> If <b>locks</b> are used to enclose the entire code then the performance of the code drastically decreases. Software Transactional Memory (STM) is a promising new approach to programming shared-memory parallel processors. It is a concurrency control mechanism that is widely considered to be easier to use by programmers than locking. It allows portions of a program to execute in isolation, without regard to other, concurrently executing tasks. A programmer can reason about the correctness of code within a transaction and need not worry about complex interactions with other, concurrently executing parts of the program. If STM is used to enclose the entire code then the performance of the code is {{the same as that of}} the code in which STM is used to enclose the critical section only and is far better than <b>code</b> in which <b>locks</b> have been used to enclose the entire code. So STM is easier to use than locks as critical section does not need to be identified in case of STM. This paper shows the concept of writing code using Software Transactional Memory (STM) and the performance comparison of <b>codes</b> using <b>locks</b> with those using STM. It also shows why the use of STM in parallel-processing code is better than the use of lock...|$|R
