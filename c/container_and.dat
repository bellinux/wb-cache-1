5|$|Because {{potassium}} {{reacts with}} water vapor in the air, {{it is usually}} stored under anhydrous mineral oil or kerosene. Unlike lithium and sodium, however, potassium should not be stored under oil for longer than 6 months, unless in an inert (oxygen free) atmosphere, or under vacuum. After prolonged storage in air dangerous shock-sensitive peroxides can form on the metal and under {{the lid of the}} <b>container,</b> <b>and</b> can detonate upon opening.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} years of his career, {{dedicated}} almost exclusively to the Sagrada Família, Gaudí reached the culmination of this naturalistic style, creating a synthesis of all of the solutions and styles he had tried until then. Gaudí achieved perfect harmony between structural and ornamental elements, between plastic and aesthetic, between function and form, between <b>container</b> <b>and</b> content, achieving the integration of all arts in one structured, logical work.|$|E

5|$|Maurice Hurley saw {{the episode}} as {{commentary}} {{on the sale of}} F-14 Tomcats to Iran. He intended to have Doctor Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) reveal her feelings for Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) in this episode, but Gene Roddenberry had it changed. Dan Curry created the model of the drone seen in this episode using a pantyhose <b>container</b> <b>and</b> a shampoo bottle. The opinions of critics were mixed, but singled out the appearance of Vincent Schiavelli for praise.|$|E
5|$|The Isobarik is {{so named}} as it employs the {{isobaric}} loading principle invented by Harry Olson in the 1950s: two bass units are mounted {{in a sealed}} <b>container</b> <b>and</b> driven in parallel so as to effectively double the speaker enclosure volume and extend its bass frequency response beyond what would be possible for otherwise identical speakers. Linn used {{a variant of the}} isobaric principle and patented the use of two bass drive units ("woofers") facing forward in an isobaric arrangement in early 1974.|$|E
5|$|The {{model of}} the drone was created by Dan Curry, from a L'eggs pantyhose <b>container</b> <b>and</b> a shampoo bottle. He hand {{animated}} the model instead of using motion control photography, using his years of Tai Chi training to keep the movements fluid. In order to blend into the background, he wore a pair of green tights whilst he was manually moving the model on screen.|$|E

5|$|A {{temporary}} wooden effigy with {{a copper}} crown {{was made for}} the funeral; {{this is the first}} known use of a funeral effigy in England, and was probably necessary because of the condition of the King's body, which had been dead for three months. Edward's heart was removed, placed in a silver <b>container,</b> <b>and</b> later buried with Isabella at Newgate Church in London. His tomb includes a very early example of an English alabaster effigy, with a tomb-chest and a canopy made of oolite and Purbeck stone. Edward was buried in the shirt, coif and gloves from his coronation, and his effigy depicts him as king, holding a sceptre and orb, and wearing a strawberry-leaf crown. The effigy features a pronounced lower lip, and may be a close likeness of Edward.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} {{permission to}} do so, the Coast Guard boarded the KD II. The stench of decaying flesh quickly led them to a large quantity of shark fins. They were in bundles on the deck, the shipping <b>container</b> <b>and</b> filling most of the 40-ton (36-tonne) hold, where the ammonia odor {{was so strong that}} the Coast Guardsman who found them had to breathe through his mouth since it burned his nose. Since no corresponding carcasses could be found, the task force told the boarding party that this indicated a likely violation of the SFPA, and to consider the ship a crime scene as the fins were contraband.|$|E
5|$|Air Hong Kong was {{the launch}} {{customer}} for the Airbus A300-600F General Freighter, {{which is a}} new variant of the Airbus A300-600F.

50|$|Aside {{from the}} main salvage {{operation}} of Napoli, a local salvage firm was appointed to clear up the beach <b>and</b> remove the <b>containers</b> <b>and</b> flotsam. The earlier scavenging of the washed-up <b>containers</b> <b>and</b> cargo created {{a difference of opinion}} among people, some claiming it made the cleanup of the beach harder as wreckers forced open some sealed <b>containers</b> <b>and</b> sifted through the contents, leaving the unwanted items strewn across the beach. Others claimed that removing the flotsam contributed to the cleanup of Branscombe beach.|$|R

5|$|Dense gases such as xenon and {{sulfur hexafluoride}} can be breathed safely when mixed {{with at least}} 20% oxygen. Xenon at 80% {{concentration}} along with 20% oxygen rapidly produces the unconsciousness of general anesthesia (and {{has been used for}} this, as discussed above). Breathing mixes gases of different densities very effectively and rapidly so that heavier gases are purged along with the oxygen, and do not accumulate {{at the bottom of the}} lungs. There is, however, a danger associated with any heavy gas in large quantities: it may sit invisibly in a <b>container,</b> <b>and</b> a person who enters an area filled with an odorless, colorless gas, may be asphyxiated without warning. Xenon is rarely used in large enough quantities for this to be a concern, though the potential for danger exists any time a tank or container of xenon is kept in an unventilated space.|$|E
5|$|In St. Louis, Anson Stokes, an apathetic {{employee}} at a self storage facility, is yelled at by his boss {{to clean out}} an old and dusty storage locker. To his surprise, he finds a woman wrapped in a rug. His boss comes to check on him; while he is yelling for Anson, his mouth disappears. FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) speak with the boss, Jay Gilmore, after surgery to fix his mouth, which has left him disfigured and with a speech impediment. They question Stokes' brother Leslie at their mobile home, which inexplicably has a large boat in its tiny front yard. The woman from the storage container is in the Stokes brothers' kitchen. Mulder and Scully search the <b>container</b> <b>and</b> find old antiques {{and a picture of}} the previous owner with the woman from the apartment.|$|E

Each ballot is unfolded by the first Scrutineer; all three Scrutineers separately write down the name indicated on the ballot. The last of the Scrutineers reads the name aloud.|$|E

The international market share of China's containers is getting larger and there have been various products released since 1993. The product structure was very simple at the beginning, but now it has various products for special purposes including many cargo containers such as warm-keeping <b>containers,</b> pot <b>containers</b> <b>and</b> dry bulk cargo containers, regional special <b>containers</b> <b>and</b> semi-trailer <b>containers</b> <b>and</b> so on.

5|$|The hoard was {{concentrated}} {{in a single}} location, within the completely decayed remains of a wooden chest. The objects had been grouped within the chest; for example, pieces such as ladles and bowls were stacked inside each other, and other items were grouped in a way consistent with being held within an inner box. Some items had been disturbed by burrowing animals and ploughing, but the overall amount of disturbance was low. It was possible to determine the original layout of the artefacts within the <b>container,</b> <b>and</b> {{the existence of the}} container itself, due to Lawes' prompt notification of the find, which allowed it to be excavated in situ by professional archaeologists.|$|E
5|$|The plastic lemon <b>container</b> <b>and</b> {{the idea}} of {{marketing}} lemon juice in this manner was also undertaken independently by Stanley Wagner, a businessperson in the frozen food industry, and also a former Royal Air Force fighter pilot. Wagner's plastic lemon was produced by Shipton, a plastics company. Wagner was with the company Coldcrops, Ltd., which produced Realemon. The Realemon trademark was developed and used for a lemon juice product based upon reconstitution in the 1940s. Realemon was later renamed to ReaLem by Coldcrops. Hax lemon juice {{was the first to}} be packaged and marketed in said lemon-shaped container, with Coldcrops following shortly thereafter with their own design. It is of intrigue to some that both Pugh and Wagner were both former Royal Air Force pilots.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} any liquid is an {{interface}} between that liquid {{and some other}} medium. The top surface of a pond, for example, is an interface between the pond water and the air. Surface tension, then, is not a property of the liquid alone, but a property of the liquid's interface with another medium. If a liquid is in a container, then besides the liquid/air interface at its top surface, {{there is also an}} interface between the liquid and the walls of the container. The surface tension between the liquid and air is usually different (greater than) its surface tension with the walls of a <b>container.</b> <b>And</b> where the two surfaces meet, their geometry must be such that all forces balance.|$|E

5|$|After another full {{examination}} in 1911, with {{comparisons to}} the Ashmolean head, archaeologists dismissed the Ashmolean head as a fake. The absence of firm {{evidence of the}} whereabouts of Cromwell's head between 1684 and 1787 made them wary about declaring the head genuine. They concluded their study unable to verify or refute the head's identity. The uncertainty increased public demand for a full scientific examination, and Wilkinson reluctantly allowed the head to be taken for examination by the eugenicist Karl Pearson and the anthropologist Geoffrey Morant. Their 109-page report {{concluded that there was}} a “moral certainty” that the Wilkinson head was that of Oliver Cromwell. Horace Wilkinson died in 1957, bequeathing the head to his son, also called Horace. Horace Wilkinson wished to organise a proper burial for the head rather than a public display, so he contacted Sidney Sussex College, which welcomed the burial. There it was interred on 25 March 1960, in a secret location near the antechapel, preserved in the oak box in which the Wilkinson family had kept the head since 1815. The box was placed into an airtight <b>container</b> <b>and</b> buried with only a few witnesses, including family and representatives of the college. The secret burial was not announced until October 1962.|$|E
5|$|Clearly, {{some sort}} of {{flexible}} bag was required to contain an explosive gel so {{that it did not}} matter how the bomb landed on the target. However, a flexible bag is hard to throw and trials had not been at all satisfactory. Discussions of the problem in Macrae's office were overheard by Gordon Norwood, a master printer who Macrae had recruited from his former magazine publishing employer, but he was not directly working on the weapon. Norwood suggested that what was needed was a frangible <b>container</b> <b>and</b> to the annoyance of the War Office store keeper he obtained a 150 W light bulb with which to demonstrate his point: a spherical glass flask inside a sock of woven wool is rigid when thrown, but on contact the glass breaks and the bomb deforms to the required shape. Experiments with glass flasks filled with cold porridge confirmed that this was the way to go. The grenade needed a delay for the thrower to get clear, so the woollen sock was covered in a sticky substance ensuring that the bomb stayed in place for a few seconds before detonating. Having covered the bomb in glue, a non-sticky handle was required. In the handle, a delay fuse was ignited by releasing a sprung lever so that a five second time delay starts as the grenade leaves the thrower's hand (just like the levers found on a conventional Mills bomb type hand grenade).|$|E
