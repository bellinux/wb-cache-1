5|$|The Grand Palace has twelve gates (ประตู, Pratu, {{literally}} a door), three along {{each of the}} four walls. These massive gates are built of brick and mortar and are topped with a Prang style spire. These gates are all painted in white, with gigantic red doors. Each of these outer gates were given rhyming names, starting from the north west in a <b>clockwise</b> <b>direction</b> around.|$|E
5|$|Tropical cyclones, {{a source}} of very heavy rainfall, consist of large air masses several hundred miles across with low {{pressure}} at the centre and with winds blowing inward towards the centre in either a <b>clockwise</b> <b>direction</b> (southern hemisphere) or counter clockwise (northern hemisphere). Although cyclones can take an enormous toll in lives and personal property, they may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they impact, as they may bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions. Areas in their path can receive a year's worth of rainfall from a tropical cyclone passage.|$|E
5|$|Beginning at Main Street, U.S.A. Station {{adjacent}} to the Magic Kingdom park's entrance, the trains of the Walt Disney World Railroad travel along its single track in a <b>clockwise</b> <b>direction</b> on its circular route. It takes about 20 minutes for each train to complete a round trip on the WDWRR's main line, and on any given day, either two or three trains run, with two running on a typical day. Each train is operated by an engineer and fireman in the locomotive, {{as well as a}} conductor {{at the rear of the}} train who supervises the passengers.|$|E

5|$|The Zoloti Vorota station {{features}} {{a number of}} distinct mosaic decorations, which were completed by artists Hryhoriy Korin and Volodymyr Fedko. There are a total of 80 large mosaic pieces; they run in a <b>clockwise</b> <b>direction</b> around the station, depicting the history of Kievan Rus. The two artists, accompanied by the station's lead architect Vadym Zhezherin, concluded that the station should be decorated with mosaic pieces of historical significance of the period {{leading up to the}} Mongol invasion of Rus'. Korin completed the mosaics in either ends of the station and the large ceiling arches, while Fedko was completed the unique images relating to Kievan Rus' and the smaller arches in between each of the station's pillars.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from these}} sculptures, entire {{sequences}} from the Hindu epics (commonly the Ramayana and the Mahabharata) have been sculpted in a <b>clockwise</b> <b>direction</b> {{starting at the}} main entrance. The right to left sequence is the same direction taken by the devotees in their ritual circumambulation as they wind inward toward the inner sanctum. Depictions from mythology such as the epic hero Arjuna shooting fish, the elephant-headed god Ganesha, the Sun god Surya, the weather and war god Indra, and Brahma with Sarasvati are common. Also frequently seen in these temples is Durga, with several arms holding weapons given to her by other gods, {{in the act of}} killing a buffalo (a demon in a buffalo's form) and Harihara (a fusion of Shiva and Vishnu) holding a conch, wheel and trident. Many of these friezes were signed by the artisans, the first known instance of signed artwork in India.|$|E
5|$|Devotees can first {{complete}} a ritual circumambulation on the jagati {{starting from the}} main entrance by walking in a <b>clockwise</b> <b>direction</b> (towards the left) before entering the mantapa, following the sculptural clockwise-sequenced reliefs on the outer temple walls depicting a sequence of epic scenes from the Hindu epics. Temples that are not built on a jagati can have steps flanked by elephant balustrades (parapets) {{that lead to the}} mantapa from ground level. An example of a temple that does not exhibit the raised platform is the Bucesvara temple in Korvangla, Hassan District. In temples with two shrines (dvikuta), the vimanas (the shrines or cellae) may be placed either next to each other or on opposite sides. The Lakshmidevi temple at Doddagaddavalli is unique to Hoysala architecture as it has four shrines around a common centre and a fifth shrine within the same complex for the deity Bhairava (a form of Shiva). In addition, four minor shrines exist at each corner of the courtyard (prakaram).|$|E
40|$|A highly uniform multiwavelength erbium-doped fiber ring laser with an {{intracavity}} sine {{phase modulator}} is demonstrated. The flat output spectrum {{is achieved by}} optimizing the cavity structure, modulation amplitude, and frequency of the sine phase modulator. Fifteen lasing lines with wavelength spacing of 0. 9 nm appear simultaneously and stably with power differences less than 2 dB and side-mode suppression ratio higher than 32 dB. In addition, the proposed cavity can support unidirectional operation without optical isolators. An output power difference of about 20 dB is realized between the counterclockwise and <b>clockwise</b> <b>directions,</b> which is almost independent of the pump power and lasing wavelengths.

5|$|Wind blowing {{over the}} surface of the sea causes {{friction}} at the interface between air and sea. Not only does this cause waves to form but it also makes the surface seawater move {{in the same direction as}} the wind. Although winds are variable, in any one place they predominantly blow from a single direction and thus a surface current can be formed. Westerly winds are most frequent in the mid-latitudes while easterlies dominate the tropics. When water moves in this way, other water flows in to fill the gap and a circular movement of surface currents known as a gyre is formed. There are five main gyres in the world's oceans: two in the Pacific, two in the Atlantic, and one in the Indian Ocean. The North Atlantic gyre that produces the Sargasso Sea accumulates salinity levels as high as 38‰. Other smaller gyres are found in lesser seas and a single gyre flows around Antarctica. These gyres have followed the same routes for millennia, guided by the topography of the land, the wind direction, and the Coriolis effect. The surface currents flow in a <b>clockwise</b> <b>direction</b> in the Northern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The water moving away from the equator is warm, while that flowing towards it has lost most of its heat. These currents tend to moderate the Earth's climate, cooling the equatorial region, and warming regions at higher latitudes. Global climate and weather forecasts are powerfully affected by the world ocean, so global climate modelling makes use of ocean circulation models as well as models of other major components such as the atmosphere, land surfaces, aerosols, and sea ice. Ocean models make use of a branch of physics, geophysical fluid dynamics, that describes the large-scale flow of fluids such as seawater.|$|E

25|$|Young halibut {{are highly}} migratory and {{generally}} migrate in a <b>clockwise</b> <b>direction</b> {{east and south}} throughout the Gulf of Alaska.

40|$|Abstract: — A code {{is written}} for {{decoding}} the quadrature {{signals from the}} rotary encoder, to get a pulse train along with direction signal, which shows one transition period, and {{the direction of the}} rotation, whether in clockwise or anti <b>clockwise</b> <b>directions</b> respectively. It is especially important for machines in Industries which have to monitor the transition periods, or for machines used for Image Processing. Using AVR Studio 4, and AVR GCC, a C code for decoding the quadrature signals is being presented, which gives the pulse for one cycle and the direction in which the encoder is being rotated. With a change in direction, there is a change in the direction pulse, and the pulse indicates the completion of one transition cycle. It is explained in detail in the documentation.

40|$|SummaryBacterial flagellar {{switching}} between counterclockwise and <b>clockwise</b> <b>directions</b> {{is mediated}} by the coupling of the chemotactic system and the motor switch complex. The conformational changes of FliG are closely associated with this switching mechanism. We present two crystal structures of FliGMC from Helicobacter pylori, each showing distinct domain orientations from previously solved structures. A 180 ° rotation of the charged ridge-containing C-terminal subdomain FliGCα 1 – 6 that is prompted by the rotational freedom of Met 245 psi and Phe 246 phi at the MFXF motif was revealed. Studies on the swarming and swimming behavior of Escherichia coli mutants further identified {{the importance of the}} 245 MFXF 248 motif and a highly conserved residue, Asn 216, in motor switching. Additionally, multiple conformations of FliGCα 1 – 6 were demonstrated by intramolecular cysteine crosslinking. The conformational flexibility of FliGc leads us to propose a model that accounts for the symmetrical torque generation process and for the dynamics of the motor...|$|R
