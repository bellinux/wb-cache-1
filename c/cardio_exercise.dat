40|$|Aim: It {{was aimed}} to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>Cardio</b> Bosu <b>exercises</b> on the psychological states of sedentary women. Material and Methods: A total of 30 voluntary women with the age range of 25 - 45 years participated in the study. A 12 -week <b>cardio</b> bosu <b>exercise</b> program was applied three times per week. Before and after the exercise period, Body Image Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, self- representation inventory and Beck depression questionnaire were applied. Results: At the end of 12 -week regular <b>cardio</b> bosu <b>exercises,</b> the second measurement of stress value {{was not statistically significant}} although it was lower than the first measurement. A significant decrease was detected in depression scores (p< 0. 05). Also, even though the second measurement of self-representation score increased, it was not considered statistically significant. The decrease in body image scores was significant (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: It can be stated that <b>cardio</b> bosu <b>exercises</b> reduce depression levels in sedentary women and contribute positively to body image. Sedentary women should be encouraged to do regular <b>cardio</b> bosu <b>exercises</b> in order to reduce their stress and depression levels as well as increase their body image positively...|$|R

40|$|As attention-deficit/hyperactivity {{disorder}} (ADHD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequently diagnosed developmental disorders in childhood, effective yet safe treatment options are highly important. Recent research introduced physical exercise as a potential treatment option, particularly for children with ADHD. The aim of this review was to systematically analyze potential acute and chronic effects of cardio and non-cardio exercise on a broad range of functions in children with ADHD and to explore this in adults as well. Literature on physical exercise in patients with ADHD was systematically reviewed based on categorizations for exercise type (cardio versus non-cardio), effect type (acute versus chronic), and outcome measure (cognitive, behavioral/socio-emotional, and physical/(neuro) physiological). Furthermore, the methodological quality of the reviewed papers was addressed. <b>Cardio</b> <b>exercise</b> seems acutely beneficial regarding various executive functions (e. g., impulsivity), response time and several physical measures. Beneficial chronic effects of <b>cardio</b> <b>exercise</b> were found on various functions as well, including executive functions, attention and behavior. The acute and chronic effects of non-cardio exercise remain more questionable but seem predominantly positive too. Research provides evidence that physical exercise represents a promising alternative or additional treatment option for patients with ADHD. Acute and chronic beneficial effects of especially <b>cardio</b> <b>exercise</b> were reported with regard to several cognitive, behavioral, and socio-emotional functions. Although physical exercise may therefore represent an effective treatment option that could be combined with other treatment approaches of ADHD, more well-controlled studies on this topic, in both children and adults, are needed...|$|E

40|$|International Journal of Exercise Science 10 (4) : 531 - 540, 2017. Elevated {{stress hormone}} {{concentrations}} can positively affect an athlete’s overall performance during a competition, {{and in many}} cases, are necessary {{to be able to}} perform exercise. During extreme exercise, the body’s ability to utilize energy efficiently can affect an athlete’s performance. Elevated hormonal concentrations can have many benefits in regards to an athlete’s overall performance during a competition. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the effects of long distance running, such as seen during an ultra-running event (distances beyond 26. 2 miles), on the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis production of cortisol (CORT) as compared to autonomic nervous system production of salivary alpha-amylase (AA). Despite the well-known effects of exercise on CORT and AA response, it is unclear what effect running beyond the marathon distance has on these levels. This study investigates what effect long duration <b>cardio</b> <b>exercise,</b> such as running up to 100 K (kilometers) distance, has on the neuroendocrine system, by means of saliva samples provided by participants signed up for an ultra-marathon event. The findings of this study show that the autonomic nervous system may present a response signal during physical stress that is independent of the HPA axis response. At distances beyond the marathon length, the production of CORT and AA was found to be suppressed for athletes, which could help them in their continued performance. Furthermore, this study recognizes a difference in the overall male and female response to stress in regards to CORT and AA production...|$|E
40|$|Becoming more {{physically}} active {{is associated with}} increased confidence to maintain smoking abstinence as well as success at stopping smoking. The {{purpose of the current}} study was to assess the effects of two different types of exercise (cardiovascular and Hatha yoga) on general and cue-elicited craving for a cigarette. Participants were 76 smokers ages 18 - 45 (mean= 29) who smoked at least 10 cigarettes per day (mean= 20) for at least one year. Participants were randomly assigned to engage in 30 minutes of cardiovascular activity (walking on a treadmill), yoga, or to view a video about exercise (control). Participants completed a self-report measure of craving (Questionnaire of Smoking Urges-Brief [QSU-brief]; Cox, Tiffany, 2 ̆ 6 Christen, 2001) and a brief mood form, as well as a picture-based cue reactivity assessment before and approximately five minutes after the activity. Results demonstrated that participants in both exercise groups reported a significant decrease in anticipation of pleasure from smoking following exercise as compared to the control group, as measured by Factor 1 of the QSU-brief (p 3 ̆c. 05) up to 20 minutes following exercise. Participants in both exercise groups also reported significant decrease in smoking to relieve negative affect or withdrawal only 20 minutes after exercising, as measured by Factor 2 of the QSU-brief (p 3 ̆c. 05). There was also a trend toward a significant group x time interaction effect for the QSU-brief Global scale (p =. 053) immediately following exercise and a significant decrease in craving 20 minutes after exercise (p =. 040). These effects were fully mediated by both an increase in positive mood and a decrease in negative mood following exercise (p 2 ̆ 7 s 3 ̆c. 05) and a decrease in negative mood 20 minutes after exercise. Following activity, the cardiovascular group had a significant decrease in craving towards smoking pictures and an increase in craving towards neutral pictures, the yoga group demonstrated a significant decrease towards both smoking and neutral cues, and the control group had an increase in craving over time for both types of cues (ps 3 ̆c. 05). Overall, these findings suggest that both cardiovascular activity and yoga may reduce urges to smoke following exercise, but that <b>cardio</b> <b>exercise</b> may be specifically associated with reduced cue-elicited craving. Future studies should examine the relationship between acute and long-term effects of exercise on cravings and smoking behavior. This can inform the potential application of exercise regimens within smoking cessation programs...|$|E
40|$|Increased self confidence, lower {{depressive}} symptoms and improved physical fitness {{are the results}} of a free training program to assist adolescents suffering the debilitating effects of Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), facilitated by the Institute of Health and Rehabilitation Studies, at The University of Notre Dame Australia (UNDA). The Adolescent Movement Program, AMP it up, is a twice-weekly, 90 minute exercise program, and is the only ‘adolescent focussed’ initiative of its kind in Western Australia. It is helping to assist youth to engage in physical activity by improving their basic motor skills and components of physical fitness, such as cardiovascular endurance, muscle strength, muscle endurance, flexibility and balance. Institute for Health and Rehabilitation Research Director, Professor Beth Hands, said adolescents with special needs and their parents were drawn to the program as it provided free therapy in a supportive, positive and socially acceptable setting. “The criteria to come in to the program is that participants must have poor coordination, so we’re looking at adolescents who are unable to participate in the simple everyday activities of daily living,” Professor Hands said. “We have participants not only affected by DCD but other conditions which affect movement, such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Cerebral Palsy and Down syndrome. ” Professor Hands said adolescents in these groups were unable to participate in most sports and recreational activities enjoyed by their peers. She said this exclusion impacted on their physical and emotional wellbeing and resulted in lower physical self-concept and social self-perception, occurring {{as a result of the}} very public nature of their disability. “When young, these youth were excluded from many playground games as they couldn’t run fast or catch a ball, so nobody wanted them on their team. On school sports days, everybody can see their inadequacy when they come last in every race,” she said. “Consequently, they withdraw from physical activity opportunities with the related health costs of low fitness and associated lifestyle related diseases. ” Professor Hands said a major concern facing adolescents with DCD is that they were often not identified as having the condition. “Teachers, parents and coaches often think they’re simply being lazy or just not the sporty type. They just look poorly coordinated or clumsy but they suffer many physical, social and emotional consequences,” she said. “DCD needs to be recognised as a learning disability in the same way as other specific learning disabilities. Many people don’t realise poor coordination is a diagnosable condition but it doesn’t attract any disability allowance or medical rebate for remedial services. ” Professor Hands said adolescents participating in AMP it up engaged in two 90 minute exercise sessions per week, working with UNDA Exercise and Sport Science, Physiotherapy, and Health and Physical Education students, on a <b>cardio</b> <b>exercise,</b> strength and resistance program. “This setting and the adaptable equipment suits their social and physical needs. The ultimate aim is to provide these adolescents with the skills, fitness and confidence to regularly exercise in their local exercise facility when they become adults,” she said. Professor Hands said many parents of AMP it up participants felt overwhelming relief to find the program for their children. For many, this was the first time their child had enjoyed participating in exercise. Lisa McBride, Mum of Callan, who was diagnosed with Autistic Spectrum Disorder at age three, said the program had been a God-send for her and her son who suffered anxiety when faced with having to compete with his peers due to his loving, non-competitive nature. “Callan is now happily participating in his second term of AMP it up and we are amazed at the results. Our family and friends are all commenting on Callan’s improved posture and we are very pleased that his enthusiasm for physical activity in general has greatly increased,” Ms McBride said. “We no longer have to negotiate a deal on taking the dog for a walk! Callan has also had a noticeable weight loss and we often catch him admiring his new physique in the bathroom mirror. ” Ms McBride said she was grateful for the AMP it up program, Professor Hand’s unwavering positivity and Notre Dame’s Exercise Science students who volunteered their time to make a difference in her son’s life. “This is the miracle I have prayed for. I often wonder if they realise how they have truly turned our lives around,” she said. “The simple fact that Callan is always looking forward to his sessions at AMP it up is a small miracle in itself, let alone the amazing transformation in Callan’s physical wellbeing. ” Media Contact: Andrea Barnard (+ 61) 8 9433 0610, Mob (+ 61) 0408 959 13...|$|E

Methods Seventeen adolescents with CF (9 ♂ and 8 ♀; 14. 7 (12. 1 - 17. 8) years), mean FEV 1 predicted 80 % (45 % - 117 %) performed on the same day the CPET, SRT and domain 6 and 8 of the BOT- 2. Results Pearson correlation between BOT- 2, the percentile score on domains 6 and 8, and CPET was moderate to good. VO 2 peakl/min: r=. 69. R 2 = 47 %; VO 2 peakl/min/kg: r=. 77. R 2 = 59 %; Wpeak: r=. 65. R 2 = 42 % and Wpeakkg: r=. 64. R 2 = 40 %. Spearman‟s rank correlation was moderate to good between the point score of the BOT- 2 (domain 6) and SRT-VO 2 peak(ml/min) : rs=. 54; SRT-VO 2 peak(ml/min/kg); rs=. 62; SRT-Wpeakkg; rs=. 51 and between BOT- 2 domain 8 Point score and SR- VO 2 peak ml/min/kg; rs=. 58. Conclusion There is a moderate association between the BOT- 2 and the [1] CPET and [2] SRT. Children who were performing low in the BOT- 2 also performed low in the STR and the CPET. We concluded that it is useful to measure physical fitness with a performance test and a CPET in children with CF. Only when the purpose is measuring aerobic capacity the CPET or SRT must be used, with preference for CPET because of accessibility of norm values. The domains 6 and 8 of the BOT- 2 seem to reflect better the motor and muscular components of health related fitness in children with CF. These components are of particular importance during growth, when children explore their movement potential and develop basic motor skills...|$|R
