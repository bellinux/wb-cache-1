40|$|This study {{examined}} the travel behavior of <b>commercial</b> <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> passengers in Lagos State, Nigeria. The descriptive research survey was used {{in order to assess}} the opinions of the respondents using the questionnaire. A total of 84 samples were used as representative population, while two null hypotheses were formulated and tested using the Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient at 0. 05 level of significant. The results that were obtained indicated that a positive correlation exists between frequency of travel and commuters income in Lagos Metropolis and also that a positive correlation exists between frequency of travel and distance covered by commuters in Lagos Metropolis. Secondary data was also sourced to serve as complement to the primary data, thus allowing for a robust research. Descriptive statistical tools such as percentages were also adopted to present the socio-economic characteristics in the area. Findings showed that about 57 % of sampled population are male, 62 % are civil servants, 48 % of respondents travel for business purposes. Also, that majority of the respondents (50 %) said that the <b>commercial</b> <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> is highly prone to accident, while about 64 % of the respondents commute on daily basis. It was established that lack of transport infrastructure coupled with poor road maintenance were seen as the leading causes of inaccessibility of the area...|$|E

40|$|After {{decades of}} stagnation, the {{competitive}} market for <b>commercial</b> <b>public</b> bus <b>transport</b> services in Germany {{is beginning to}} move. Nevertheless, compared to the total market volume, {{the number of cases}} where competition is observable remains small. An empirical analysis of competition in the commercial services market as compared to competition in the non-commercial services market confirms that entry barriers do exist. These barriers clearly impede competitive developments in this embryonic market, which relies on the market initiatives of operators to develop. The paper identifies a key entry barrier in the institutional framework: for potential market entrants, the overall uncertainty regarding competitive procedures for commercial services is significantly higher than usual in tendering procedures. This high uncertainty poses the main disadvantage for newcomers as compared to incumbents. <b>Public</b> <b>transport</b> Bus Tendering Regulation Commercial services Competition Market entry barriers...|$|R

30|$|An {{important}} {{technique in}} deploying D 2 D communication is device discovery. Device discovery is characterized {{into two categories}} which are distributed discovery and centralized discovery. In the distributed discovery design, optimal resources and legitimate transmission power are apportioned {{with the consent of}} base station. However, this strategy involves complex signaling overhead and multifaceted nature of multiple transmitters to be composed [4]. In contrast, centralized device discovery design is adequately controlled by the base station and resources are managed by center system. Besides, the proximity services, for example, <b>commercial</b> announcement, <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> and municipality information, local programs, and impulsive social and corporate contacts infer decreased energy consumption and latency. Therefore, in D 2 D-enabled centralized networks, multiple devices coexisting is a challenging subject of device discovery for D 2 D communication to initiate the proximity services. However, latest reviews have concentrated on the D 2 D communication issues accepting that device discovery issue [5 – 7] is the vital problem and needs solution.|$|R

This chapter explores the meaning of ‘integration’, suggesting there are a series of ways in which different aspects of integration link together. These include physical design aspects which range from the micro level consideration of co-location, through to the macro-level consideration of integrating land use and transport planning. All of this occurs within the context of planning policy and its associated legal framework. The operational design aspects of integration function within a framework of transport policy and law that, for example in the UK, includes the largely <b>commercial</b> operations of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> and competition law. There are links at all levels between the physical and operational design aspects of transport integration, but there is an important question as to whether there are effective links between these two systems in practice, which is needed in order to fully achieve an integrated transport system...|$|R
40|$|Transit Oriented Development (TOD) {{is often}} {{linked to the}} compact, green, mixed use and {{sustainable}} development. It encourages people to reduce the use of private vehicles. A TOD area consists of various types of land uses i. e. residential, <b>commercial,</b> <b>public</b> facilities and employment area. A transit station within the walking distance to houses centres the TOD area. Conceptually, it is attracting people to use <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> in making a trip. However, the actual level of acceptance by residents on the <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> services within the TOD area is not being clearly examined in Malaysia. As a TOD area, Mentari Court, still jams out with private car as large numbers of residents {{in the study area}} were still using private cars for their daily working trip purposes. This study examined the residents’ transportation mode preferences in the transit oriented (TOD) area of Mentari Court Apartment, Sunway City, Petaling Jaya. The findings from the field study of 99 respondents of the Mentari Court residents revealed that most of the respondents chose <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> for leisure trip and walking for the daily working trip to the short distance between their apartment and work place. However, incomplete route of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> network, poor connectivity and services, long journey, and fear of crime had discouraged some of the respondents to use <b>public</b> <b>transport.</b> As a proposal, TOD should be implemented in a regional level instead of local level to increase the integration and coverage of transit network...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAlthough its {{importance}} for sustainable tourism is recognised {{little research has}} been conducted on tourist use of <b>public</b> <b>transport.</b> This paper examines the use of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> by visitors in the city of Munich, Germany. Its objectives are twofold. First, it investigates the motivations for using or not using <b>public</b> <b>transport.</b> It focuses on distinctive characteristics between the users and non-users and how they are different in their demographic and travel profiles as well as their attitude towards <b>public</b> <b>transport.</b> Second, it seeks to understand which factors influence visitor use of <b>public</b> <b>transport.</b> The main reasons for visitor use of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> are drive-free benefits, traffic reduction, advantages of local <b>public</b> <b>transport,</b> and car unavailability. In contrast, what often discourages <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> use are inconvenience and restrictions, lack of information, disadvantages of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> and personal preferences. The five most important variables that differentiate visitor user of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> from a non-user are length of stay, main purpose of trip, age group, frequency of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> use at place of residence, and valid driving license ownership. The study highlights the importance of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> information and accessible and conveniently located train stations and bus stops for visitors and locals alike.

40|$|Abstract:- The <b>Public</b> <b>transport</b> {{reform is}} very {{important}} to increase the use of <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> mode. <b>Public</b> <b>transport</b> problems include: an overall lack of capacity, lack of quality and choice, severe traffic congestions and insufficient fund to renew and repair vehicles. Generally, the comfort and quality of the <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> fleet is poor, and many of the vehicles are dilapidated and dirty. Whereas those who can least afford to travel may be prepared to suffer such indignities, people who can pay to travel by their own vehicles, or by taxi, would seldom find any temptation to use public. Increasingly, patronage will be confined to the poorest members of society, thereby further eroding service levels and comfort. Most of the <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> users are captive passengers, who use the <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> because they have no choice to travel by other modes. <b>Public</b> <b>transport</b> system in Yogyakarta and Bandung were analyzed by counting <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> vehicles and occupancies, interviewing the <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> passengers, drivers and institutional staffs, who involve in <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> management.
