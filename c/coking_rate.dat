A strong influence of the composition of the materials on the <b>coking</b> <b>rate</b> as a function of time on-stream was observed.

SEM and EDX analyses of coked and uncoked coupons revealed that the composition of the oxide layer in contact with the cracked gas, formed after the initial preoxidation or decoking, has an important influence on the amount of coke deposited. Materials that formed a thin Al 2 O 3 layer on the coupon surface showed a higher coking resistance.

Jet A is an aircraft gas turbine fuel currently in wide use. No. 2 HH was selected to represent the properties of future turbine fuels, particularly experimental Reference Broad Specification, which, under NASA sponsorship, was considered as a possible next-generation fuel. Tests were conducted with varying fuel flow rates, delivery pressures and fuel pretreatments (including preheating and deoxygenation). Simulator wall temperatures were varied between 422 K and 672 K at fuel flows of 0. 022 to 0. 22 Kg/sec. <b>Coking</b> <b>rate</b> was determined at four equally-spaced locations {{along the length of}} the simulator. Fuel samples were collected for infrared analysis. The dependence of <b>coking</b> <b>rate</b> in Jet A may be correlated with surface temperature via an activation energy of 9 to 10 kcal/mole, although the results indicate that both bulk fluid and surface temperature affect the rate of decomposition. As a consequence, flow rate, which controls bulk temperature, must also be considered. Taken together, these results suggest that the decomposition reactions are initiated on the surface and continue in the bulk fluid. The <b>coking</b> <b>rate</b> data for No. 2 HH oil are very highly temperature dependent above approximately 533 K.

Polyol process was adopted to prepare nano supported (Al 2 O 3, ZrO 2 and CeO 2) Ni based nano catalysts for DRM reaction. All catalysts were prepared in ethylene glycol medium with polyvinylpyrrolidone as a nucleation-protective agent. The main {{objective of this}} study was to develop a suitable catalyst, for syngas production, which possessed high activity, stability and minimum <b>coking</b> <b>rate</b> during DRM.

The <b>coking</b> <b>rate</b> is initially very high (catalytic coking) and drops {{after a few}} hours to a constant value. At the studied conditions the observed coking behavior on 15 Mo 3 alloy pigs can be explained via a catalytic mechanism only, and contributions of the free-radical mechanism and the condensation mechanism are insignificant.

40|$|Using {{thermogravimetry}} (TG) {{under conditions}} that minimize inhibition by the hydrogen produced, the intrinsic catalytic rates of skeletal Ni, pure and alloyed with solute metals Fe, Co, or Cu, were evaluated in methane decomposition to carbon nanofibers. In "standard" tests, i. e., after pre-reduction in H- 2 {{and exposure to}} CH 4 directly at 450 degrees C, several catalysts reached stable activities exceeding 4 mg C/mg cat. /h, comparable with literature values obtained at 500 degrees C or above. TG evidence is presented for partial bulk carburization of Ni in CH 4 below 350 degrees C, which leads to substantially increased <b>coking</b> <b>rates.</b> TEM evidence supports the view that carburization promotes catalyst particle disintegration, thereby inducing faster and more stable nanofiber growth. Irregularities in alloy response to carburization are interpreted {{in terms of the}} stability of the respective mixed-metal carbides. TEM also shows that alloying changes the metal nanocrystallite shape (habit), with consequences for the carbon nanofiber structure. Evidence for the easy dissociation of CH 4 is corroborated by direct catalyst activation in the absence of H 2. Reduction begins in pure hydrocarbon around 300 degrees C and leads to coking activities at 450 degrees C comparable to those for samples pre-reduced in H- 2 - Skeletal metal catalysts offer distinct advantages in low-temperature natural gas conversion.

40|$|Abstract. Dusting of iron {{results from}} partial {{disintegration}} of a cementite scale which grows {{on the metal}} surface during reaction with carbon-supersaturated gas. Scaling kinetics are shown {{to be consistent with}} diffusion of carbon through the cementite. Further diffusion of carbon into the iron supersaturates it to a very high degree. Dusting of nickel and austenitic alloys leads to no carbide formation. Instead graphite grows into the metal, supported by diffusion of dissolved carbon to growth sites. Variations in rate with alloy iron content reflect the known effects of iron on carbon solubility and diffusivity. Alloying with copper also changes <b>coking</b> and dusting <b>rates,</b> although copper does not affect carbon permeability. The effect is shown to be due to interaction of copper with graphite nucleation sites...|$|R
40|$|Metal dusting {{corrosion}} {{has been}} known for more than a 100 years as an industrial problem. As a result of extensive research over the last five decades several mechanisms have been evolved involving ferritic materials. However, a complete understanding is yet lacking. One of the most referred models, developed by Hochman-Grabke, suggests that formation of metastable cementite and its subsequent decomposition is the central aspect of the process. To verify this hypothesis, an Fe-Si model was designed based on silicon's ability to retard cementite formation. However, this strategy was unsuccessful because silicon oxidized and amount of silicon remaining after silica formation was not sufficient to suppress cementite. On the other hand, germanium does not form a stable oxide in the conditions employed. A alloying with germanium did prevent Fe 3 C formation, but not dusting, which resulted from an alternative mechanism. Dusted particles were confirmed to be cementite for pure iron specimens (where cementite scale formed) and ferrite for alloys that did not form cementite. These observations are inconsistent with the prior model. In addition, the general features of metal dusting corrosion have been characterized. Kinetics of coking and metal wastage for ferritic materials (Fe, Fe-Si, Fe-Ge and Fe-Ge-Ni) were found to be linear in nature, though respective rates may vary due to the differences in alloy catalytic activity and reaction morphologies. The carbon diffusion coefficient in cementite was evaluated from Fe 3 C scaling rates. Crystallographic orientations of different forms of cementite were established. Internal cementite precipitates in pure iron accounted for by a very high degree of supersaturation with respect to carbon, indicating a non-equilibrium situation. <b>Coking</b> and dusting <b>rates</b> were found to be strongly correlated and their gas composition dependence indicate the contribution of the Boudouard reaction. Reactions with fixed carbon activity gases demonstrated that kinetics rather than thermodynamics control the reaction rates. However, at a particular temperature, these rates increase with carbon activity. Activation energies for coking and dusting are equal for a given alloy, meaning that the same process controls them. For Fe-lOGe alloy, {{in the early stages of}} reaction, grains with near (001) surfaces were more susceptible to graphitization than grains having near (110) surfaces, but the underlying cause has not been revealed...|$|R

This process {{is known to}} proceed through a free radical chain mechanism. The elementary reaction steps {{that lead to the}} growth of the coke surface can be divided into five classes of reversible reactions : hydrogen abstraction, substitution, gas phase olefin addition to radical surface species, gas phase radical addition to olefinic bonds and cyclization. To identify the elementary reaction classes that determine the <b>coking</b> <b>rate,</b> all microscopic routes that start from benzene and lead to naphthalene have been investigated. It is found that initial creation of surface radicals, either by hydrogen abstraction or substitution and subsequent hydrogen abstractions, determines the global <b>coking</b> <b>rate.</b> The influence of the local polyaromatic structure on the kinetics of the hydrogen abstraction reactions is determined by performing calculations on a large set of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). On basis of the BDE values six types of possible reactive sites at the coke surface can be distinguished.

40|$|A coupled furnace/reactor {{simulation}} {{was conducted}} to determine product yields and coking rates for an industrial SL-II naphtha cracking furnace fired by both floor and wall burners. The process gas side, {{as well as the}} fire side, is simulated using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. The molecular kinetic model of Kumar and co-workers was used to simulate the naphtha cracking reactions in the reactor. The results show that the asymmetrical design of the furnace results in asymmetrical profiles of flue gas velocity, temperature, and concentration, and leads to poor heat supply of the wall burners on the front wall as well as a high-temperature zone in the crossover section. The recirculation of flue gas caused by the positioning of burners makes the temperature more uniform {{in the middle of the}} furnace. Good agreement between simulation and industrial product yields has been obtained without any tuning of the kinetics, indicating that the proposed approach can be used as a guide for further optimization of geometries and operating parameters of naphtha cracking furnaces with burners located both in the floor and in the wall.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Gene and Linda Voiland School of Chemical Engineering and Bioengineering, Washington State UniversityThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to optimize Mo-based catalysts for synthesis gas generation via partial oxidation of logistic fuels. The most conventional reforming catalysts used in industry for reforming are Ni based catalysts. Ni provides metallic sites necessary for adsorption of hydrocarbons and breaking of C-H, C-C bonds. However Ni catalysts are prone to <b>coking,</b> as the <b>rate</b> of carbon deposition is faster than its reaction with a gaseous oxidizing agent. Logistic fuels are either long chain hydrocarbons or a mixture of long chain hydrocarbons, which makes them even more complicated and prone to coking. Previous work done in our lab has demonstrated the ability of MoO 2 and Mo 2 C to reform logistic fuels such as dodecane, Jet-A fuel, surrogate biodiesel and gasoline, with good conversion, synthesis gas generation and resistance to coking. However, the performance of these catalysts leave a huge scope of improvement in terms of conversion and syn-gas generation at high weight hour space velocity (WHSV). This can be achieved in two ways, one by increasing the surface area and another by addition of metallic sites. The increase in surface area is achieved by supporting the catalysts on a high surface area silica support and for addition of metallic sites, Ni is added to the catalyst. Hence, first Mo 2 C supported Ni catalysts are synthesized and tested for partial oxidation of surrogate biodiesel (methyl oleate). Activity tests conducted for the synthesized catalysts showed 100 % carbon conversion with 90 % H 2 yield without deactivation due to coking over 24 h time-on-stream. Then MoO 2 catalysts are modified by supporting it on silica. Nanoparticle MoO 2 supported on SiO 2 is synthesized and its activity is tested and compared with commercial MoO 2 at high WHSV for partial oxidation of dodecane. Silica supported MoO 2 catalysts are active upto WHSV 51 h- 1, whereas commercial MoO 2, deactivated at WHSV 20 - 1. Finally Ni is added to silica supported MoO 2 catalysts, in order to increase the syn-gas generation at high WHSV. As expected, the hydrogen yield after addition of Ni, increases from 60 % for silica supported MoO 2 catalysts to 94 %.

40|$|Nonuniform {{temperature}} fields in steam cracking furnaces caused by geometry {{factors such as}} burner positions, shadow effects, and asymmetry of the reactor coil layout are detrimental for product yields and run lengths. The techniques of adjusting burner firing (zone firing) and feedstock mass flow rate (pass balancing) have been practiced industrially to mitigate these effects but could only reduce the nonuniformities between the so-called modules (a group of many coils). An extension of the pass balancing methodology is presented to further minimize the intra-module nonuniformities, that is, variation between the coils within a module, in floor fired furnaces. Coupled furnace-reactor computational fluid dynamics-based simulations of an industrial ultraselective conversion (USC) furnace were performed to evaluate four different feedstock flow distribution schemes, realizing equal values for coil outlet temperature, propene/ethene mass ratio, maximum <b>coking</b> <b>rate</b> and maximum tube metal temperature (TMT), respectively, over all the reactor coils. It is shown that feedstock flow distribution creates a larger operating window and extends the run length. Out of the four cases, the <b>coking</b> <b>rate</b> as criterion leads to the highest yearly production capacity for ethene and propene. Uniform maximum coking rates boost the annual production capacity of the USC furnace with a nameplate ethene capacity of 130 103 metric tons per year with 1000 metric tons for ethene and 730 metric tons for propene. For industrial application, achieving uniform maximum TMT is more practical due to its measurability by advanced laser-based techniques. Most steam cracking furnaces can be retrofitted by optimizing the dimensions of venturi nozzles that regulate the feedstock flow to the coils.

The optimal CuO-Ag loading was 40 wt%, with a Cu/Ag molar ratio of 1. 50 % carbon black conversion was achieved at 304 Â° C over the optimal catalyst, and complete combustion was attained well below 400 Â° C. A nanocomposite system of nickel aluminate (NiAl 20 4), Re and V has been synthesized for propane steam reforming. Nickel aluminate nanocrystals with various Ni/Al molar ratios were prepared by chemical co-precipitation. They were pretreated in H 2 prior to propane steam reforming to obtain highly dispersed Ni species. The Al in nickel aluminate acted as a spacer to provide uniform Ni dispersion. The catalyst with a Ni/Al molar ratio of 1. 10 showed the highest reducibility and the highest active surface area. It {{gave rise to the}} best propane conversion and H 2 yield. H 2 yield was improved with increasing reaction temperature up to 700 *C, and more H 2 could be produced at higher H 2 O/C molar ratios. Various metal promoters were introduced by impregnation or vapor grafting to improve the catalytic activity and coke resistance of the optimal nickel aluminate catalyst. Catalytic activity could be improved by introducing metal promoters in the order of Re > Rh > Pt > Ir > Pd > Ru > V. These selected additives provided increased reducibility and active surface area. In particular, I wt% Re-promoted nickel aluminate gave rise to the best catalytic activity and H 2 yield. Although Re was the most effective promoter at improving low-temperature activity, it only lowered the <b>coking</b> <b>rate</b> of nickel aluminate slightly. To inhibit coke formation over Re-promoted nickel aluminate, V was introduced as an additive. The optimal nickel aluminate system with 2 wt% Re and 2 wt% V demonstrated the highest catalytic activity and H 2 yield at low H 2 O/C ratios. <b>Coking</b> <b>rate</b> was reduced dramatically with the V additive, which promoted carbon gasification. The excellent activity, coke resistance and thermal/hydrothermal stability of Re,V-promoted nickel aluminate nanocomposite would be attractive towards H 2 generation for fuel cell applications, especially in portable devices. by Hong He.

40|$|International audienceTranspiration cooling {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{efficient}} cooling techniques, but one which generates complex phenomena that are difficult to model, and this all the more in that a reactive fluid such as an endothermic fuel is used. Above a certain temperature, such fuel is pyrolysed and, thanks to its endothermic behaviour, this ensures the active cooling of the hot walls of the combustion chamber. However, one of the consequences of this thermal decomposition is the unwanted formation of coke which blocks the porous material (both on the surface and in the interior). This gradual blocking reduces the material's permeability and thus the efficiency of the cooling system. Modelling the permeability distribution of porous materials is thus a key parameter in better understanding transpiration cooling. The present article shows several models intended to estimate the variation in time and space of the permeability of a material (stainless steel) during its coking. The fluid circulating in this porous material is n-dodecane that is maintained at a high temperature. Following a presentation of the measurement device and the measured experimental data of the mean permeability, two categories of model are studied, notably discontinuous mesh models (with 2 and 3 meshes) and continuous analytical models (linear and exponential). The results obtained show that discontinuous models with 2 and 3 meshes are very close in measuring the temporal evolution of the thickness of the coked zone of the porous material. They also revealed that the exponential model is more appropriate than the linear model in estimating the spatiotemporal evolution of the permeability. Additionally, the evolution of the <b>coking</b> <b>rate</b> in the porous material was determined as a function of time and the results show behaviour similar to that indicated in the literature. Lastly, the average Darcy permeability was linked to the mass of coke deposit in the porous material, the result of which reveals a quasi-linear decrease.

40|$|The {{effect of}} crystal size on carbon {{formation}} and sintering was studied on nickel catalysts at steam reforming conditions. Different nickel supported catalysts were examined. As support three commercial hydrotalcites were used: HT 30 (MgO/Al 2 O 3 = 3 / 7), HT 50 (MgO/Al 2 O 3 = 5 / 5) and HT 70 (MgO/Al 2 O 3 = 7 / 3). These supports {{were compared with}} CaO-Al 2 O 3 and Î±-Al 2 O 3. For the sintering experiments an industrial Ni/CaAl 2 O 4 catalyst was used for comparison. The hydrotalcite derived catalysts had different Mg/Al ratios and the lowest Mg/Al ratio gave the highest Ni dispersion. The hydrotalcite derived catalysts also had a higher dispersion than NiO/CaO-Al 2 O 3, NiO/Î±-Al 2 O 3 and Ni/CaAl 2 O 4. Carbon formation studies were performed in the tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) at 823 K, total pressure of 20 bar and steam to carbon (S/C) ratios of 0. 08 to 2. 4. The TEOM is {{a powerful tool for}} in situ catalyst characterization. All the feed gases pass through the catalysts bed and the TEOM offers a high mass resolution and a short response time. With an on-line gas chromatograph or mass spectrometer, catalyst activity and selectivity can be determined as a function of time. From the TEOM experiments it seemed that the Ni crystal size had a large effect on the carbon threshold value (S/C ratio where the carbon gasification rate equals the carbon deposition rate). Increased crystal size gave an increased carbon threshold value. It was concluded that small nickel crystals resulted in a large saturation concentration of carbon giving a low driving force for carbon diffusion and hence a lower <b>coking</b> <b>rate.</b> TOF increased with increasing Ni crystal size. This could be explained by surface inhomogeneities on the large crystals. Sintering experiments were performed at 903 K and 20 bar in a fixed-bed reactor system. For all the catalysts the sintering mechanism involving particle migration seemed to be dominating. Due to a higher degree of wetting of the substrate by the nickel particle, the catalysts with smallest nickel particles showed the highest resistance towards sintering. Hydrogenolysis of methane was used as a probe reaction for testing the catalysts activity. An increased TOF with increased Ni particle size was observed. This result coincides with results from the steam methane reforming experiments in the TEOM. The characteristics of the hydrotalcite derived catalysts prepared by impregnation of commercial hydrotalcite supports were compared with hydrotalcite derived catalysts prepared by the co-precipitation method. An improved dispersion with decreasing Mg/Al ratio in the hydrotalcite was found. The catalysts prepared by the co-precipitation method maintained a high dispersion at increased nickel loadings. Different techniques were used to determine the Ni particle size. The results showed an excellent correlation between the Ni particle size found by chemisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) ...|$|E
