40|$|Our {{knowledge}} {{on the development}} of the affective and cognitive <b>circuitries</b> that underlie affect regulation is still limited. This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study examined whether there is more efficient prefrontal modulation of affective circuits with development. Ten adolescents (mean age 14 ± 2 years) and 10 adults (mean age 30 ± 6 years) underwent two scanning conditions that required different levels of cognitive control over face emotion processing. A ‘directed’ emotion processing condition required judgment of facial expressions. An ‘incidental’ emotion processing condition required an age judgment. For the incidental emotion processing condition, adolescents, compared with adults, showed less activation in right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and greater activation in paralimbic regions, suggesting greater emotional reactivity and immature prefrontal <b>circuitries</b> for affect regulation. For the directed emotion processing condition, adolescents, compared with adults, showed decreased recruitment of both the dorsal and pregenual right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), suggesting immature modulatory functions of the ACC during directed face emotion processing. These results indicate that the neural <b>circuitries</b> for affect regulation are still developing in adolescence and have not yet reached the adult level...|$|R
5|$|Electronic devices {{make use}} of the transistor, {{perhaps one of the most}} {{important}} inventions of the twentieth century, and a fundamental building block of all modern <b>circuitry.</b> A modern integrated circuit may contain several billion miniaturised transistors in a region only a few centimetres square.|$|E
5|$|Some {{non-standard}} USB devices use the 5V {{power supply}} without {{participating in a}} proper USB network, which negotiates power draw with the host interface. These are usually called USB decorations. Examples include USB-powered keyboard lights, fans, mug coolers and heaters, battery chargers, miniature vacuum cleaners, and even miniature lava lamps. In most cases, these items contain no digital <b>circuitry,</b> and thus are not standard-compliant USB devices. This may cause problems with some computers, such as drawing too much current and damaging <b>circuitry.</b> Prior to the USB Battery Charging Specification, the USB specification required that devices connect in a low-power mode (100mA maximum) and communicate their current requirements to the host, which then permits the device to switch into high-power mode.|$|E

40|$|Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are characterised by {{impairment}} in joint attention (JA), which has two components: {{the response to}} JA and the initiation of JA. Literature suggests a correlation between JA and neural <b>circuitries,</b> although this link is still largely unexplored in ASD. In this pilot study, we aimed at investigating the neural correlates of responding and initiating JA in high-functioning children with ASD and evaluating the changes in brain function and visual pattern {{after six months of}} rehabilitative treatment using an integrated EEG/eye-tracking system. Our results showed that initiating and responding JA subtend both overlapping (i. e. frontal and temporal) and specialized (i. e. parietal for responding JA and occipital for initiating JA) neural <b>circuitries.</b> In addition, in a subgroup of subjects, we observed trends of changes in both brain activity and connectivity after rehabilitative treatment in both the two tasks, which were correlated with modifications in gaze measures. These preliminary results, if confirmed in a larger sample, suggest the feasibility of using the proposed multimodal approach to characterise JA-related brain <b>circuitries</b> and visual pattern in ASD individuals and to monitor longitudinal changes in response to rehabilitative intervention...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Spinal {{neuronal}} {{function is}} impaired after a severe {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI) and can be assessed by the analysis of spinal reflex (SR) behavior. We applied transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) and locomotor activity, {{to determine whether the}} excitability of spinal neuronal <b>circuitries</b> underlying locomotion can be modulated after motor complete SCI. METHOD: SRs were evoked by non-noxious electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve. SR behavior was assessed before, immediately after, and 20 min after four different interventions (anodal, cathodal, sham tsDCS, or locomotion) in subjects with motor complete SCI and healthy subjects. RESULTS: SR amplitudes in SCI subjects were increased after anodal tsDCS by 84 % (p< 0. 05). Cathodal, sham tsDCS and locomotion had no influence on SR amplitudes. In addition, reflex threshold was lower after anodal tsDCS and locomotion in SCI subjects (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Anodal tsDCS is able to modulate spinal neuronal <b>circuitries</b> after SCI. SIGNIFICANCE: This novel, noninvasive approach might be used as a tool to excite spinal neuronal <b>circuitries.</b> If applied repetitively within a training approach, anodal tsDCS might prevent adverse alterations in spinal reflex function in severely affected SCI subjects, i. e., a manifestation of a spinal neuronal dysfunction taking part below the level of a spinal lesion...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, many {{researches}} put significant efforts into {{understanding and}} assessing the functional {{state of the}} spinal locomotor circuits in humans. Various techniques {{have been developed to}} stimulate the spinal cord <b>circuitries,</b> which may include both diffuse and quite specific tuning effects. Overall, the findings indicate that tonic and rhythmic spinal activity control are not separate phenomena but are closely integrated to properly initiate and sustain stepping. The spinal cord does not simply transmit information to and from the brain. Its physiologic state determines reflex, postural and locomotor control and, therefore, may affect the recovery of the locomotor function in individuals with spinal cord and brain injuries.

40|$|ABSTR ACT: Neuronal <b>circuitries</b> in the {{mammalian}} {{visual system}} {{change as a}} function of experience. Sensory experience modifies neuronal networks connectivity via the activation of different physiological processes such as excitatory/inhibitory synaptic transmission, neurotrophins, and signaling of extracellular matrix molecules. Long-lasting phenomena of plasticity occur when intracellular signal transduction pathways promote epigenetic alterations of chromatin structure that regulate the induction of transcription factors that in turn drive the expression of downstream targets, the products of which then work via the activation of structural and functional mechanisms that modify synaptic connectivity. Here, we review recent findings in the field of visual cortical plasticity while focusing on how physiological mechanisms associated with experience promote structural changes that determine functional modifications of neural <b>circuitries</b> in V 1. We revise the role of microRNAs as molecular transducers of environmental stimuli and the role of immediat...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Lightning intruding waves {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes that damage the {{insulation}} of the high voltage apparatus in substations, and it always damage the electric equipments in substations and power stations. The paper does calculations on the over-voltage caused in this situation. At the same time, the influence of lightning current, capacitances, grounding resistance and outlet <b>circuitries</b> is took into account. The conclusion is that the over-voltage will climb if lightning current and grounding resistance rise. But the capacitances and outlet <b>circuitries</b> can restrain the over-voltage. When the breaker is far from the bus and the gradient of lightning waves is great, it may cause over-voltage at the foreside of the breaker. When lightning waves come to both sides of the breaker, the over-voltage may be higher and can cause more harm. Index Terms—Lightning waves; Substation; Breaker...|$|R
40|$|Hemispatial neglect is {{characterized}} by a failure of awareness on the side of space and body opposite the site of injury, has been extensively studied for its theoretical interest in revealing brain mechanisms of awareness and attention. More recently, it has become apparent that hemispatial neglect reflects not only damage of specific anatomical regions, but also the large-scale dysfunction of networks of brain regions specialized in attention, motor, and multimodal sensory processing. Finally, although previous studies showed that the symptoms of hemispatial neglect could be effectively, albeit transiently, improved by a variety of behavioral, pharmacological, and physical interventions, only recently have treatment studies begun to show long-lasting therapeutic effects.

5|$|Higinbotham {{designed}} {{a game that}} used an oscilloscope to display {{the path of a}} simulated ball on a tennis court viewed from the side. The attached computer calculated the path of the ball and reversed its path when it hit the ground. The game also simulated the ball hitting the net if it did not achieve a high enough arc as well as changes in velocity due to drag from air resistance. Two aluminum controllers were attached to the computer, each consisting of a button and a knob. Pressing the button hit the ball, and turning a knob controlled the angle of the shot. Originally, Higinbotham considered having a second knob to control the velocity of the shot, but decided it would make the controller too complicated. The device was designed in a few hours with the help of colleague Dave Potter and was assembled over three weeks with the help of technician Robert V. Dvorak. While most of the <b>circuitry</b> was based on vacuum tubes and relays, the circuits to display the graphics on the oscilloscope used transistors, then beginning to replace vacuum tubes in the electronics industry. Excluding the oscilloscope and controller, the game's <b>circuitry</b> approximately took up the space of a microwave oven.|$|E

Expansion of the cortical representation or modulation of corticomotor excitability of specific muscles engaged in task performance is required for the aquisition of the skill. These changes at cortical level appear to be paralleled by changes in transmission in spinal neuronal <b>circuitries,</b> which regulate the contribution of sensory feedback mechanisms to the execution of the task. Such adaptive changes also appear to be essential for the consolidation of a memory of performance of motor tasks and thus for the lasting ability of performing highly skilled movements such as those required for Olympic sports...|$|R

5|$|Magnavox {{designed}} {{the exterior of}} the machine, and re-engineered some the internals with some consultation from Baer and Harrison; they removed the ability to display color, used only the three dial controller, and changed the system of selecting games from a dial to separate game cards that modified the console's <b>circuitry</b> when plugged into the console. At the time, color televisions were still seen as a luxury item, and the ability to show color would have added additional expense and time spent dealing with FCC testing and regulations. The internal <b>circuitry</b> had been designed with discrete components rather than integrated circuits due to cost concerns; these concerns were no longer valid by 1971, but Magnavox did not have enough time to redesign every internal component of the machine prior to the planned production start date. Magnavox named the console first as the Skill-O-Vision while testing, and then released it as the Odyssey. The rifle game was turned into a separately sold add-on game, Shooting Gallery, and Magnavox added paper money, playing cards, and poker chips to the console, {{to go along with the}} plastic overlays for the games that enhanced the primitive visuals. The new additions helped raise the price of the console to US$99.99. Baer was upset with the board game additions, which he felt were pointless add-ons that would go unused by players. Magnavox announced the system's launch date of September 1972, and demonstrated it for months prior to Magnavox dealerships and media.|$|E

40|$|Food is {{consumed}} {{in order to}} maintain energy balance at homeostatic levels. In addition, palatable food is also consumed for its hedonic properties independent of energy status. Such reward-related consumption can result in caloric intake exceeding requirements and is considered a major culprit in the rapidly increasing rates of obesity in developed countries. Compared with homeostatic mechanisms of feeding, much less is known about how hedonic systems in brain influence food intake. Intriguingly, excessive consumption of palatable food can trigger neuroadaptive responses in brain reward <b>circuitries</b> similar to drugs of abuse. Furthermore, similar genetic vulnerabilities in brain reward systems can increase predisposition to drug addiction and obesity. Here, recent advances in our understanding of the brain <b>circuitries</b> that regulate hedonic aspects of feeding behavior will be reviewed.
