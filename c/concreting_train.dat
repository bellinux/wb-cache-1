Like so many of my (mis) adventures during {{graduate}} school, this project found its genesis during a long, rambling conversation in Chris Uggen’s office. Needing a dissertation topic, we were spit-balling ideas in between complaining about various roster issues on the Twins (I assume). While much of my past work focused on the development of police forces historically, we agreed years of archival work was just not for me. Instead, wouldn’t it be a lot more interesting to view the process as it happens? Of course, the only problem being every place you look, there’s already a well-established police force. At some point, Uggen said something to the effect of “well, they’re building a new force in Iraq. Why don’t you just head there? ” after which we both shared a hearty laugh and then more-or-less forgot about it.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} {{that climate change}} poses significant challenges to the conservation of biodiversity. The need of dealing with relatively rapid and uncertain environmental change calls for the enhancement of adaptive capacity of both biodiversity and conservation management systems. Under the hypothesis {{that most of the}} conventional biodiversity conservation tools do not sufficiently stimulate a dynamic protected area management, which takes rapid environmental change into account, we evaluated almost 900 of The Nature Conservancy's site-based conservation action plans. These were elaborated before a so-called climate clinic in 2009, an intensive revision of existing plans and a climate change training of the planning teams. We also compare these results with plans elaborated after the climate clinic. Before 2009, 20 % of the CAPs employed the term "climate change" in their description of the site viability, and 45 % identified key ecological attributes that are related to climate. 8 % of the conservation strategies were directly or indirectly related to climate change adaptation. After 2009, a significantly higher percentage of plans took climate change into account. Our data show that many planning teams face difficulties in integrating climate change in their management and planning. However, technical guidance and <b>concrete</b> <b>training</b> can facilitate management teams learning processes. Arising new tools of adaptive conservation management that explicitly incorporate options for handling future scenarios, vulnerability analyses and risk management into the management process have the potential of further making protected area management more proactive and robust against change...|$|R

The goal was to find out, whether measuring and rewarding energy efficiency are experienced as motivating in the case company and how these elements should be further developed so that work motivation could be expected to improve. Sources The theoretical part of the study was compiled out of a wide range of research articles, reports and academic textbooks concerning performance measurement, work motivation, rewarding and measuring energy efficiency. The data used in the empiric part consisted of theme interviews with the case company representatives and written material from the company. Research method The study was conducted by using theme interviews and informal discussions with the case company representatives. The interviewees consisted of directors, technical professionals and floor level employees i. e. operators. Altogether twenty one people were interviewed.

Within the qualitative paradigm, I used the case study approach to explore the perceptions of my research participants about the student-centered teaching. It is commonly observed that most of our schools are using teacher-centered approaches. As a result, students 2 ̆ 7 conceptual understanding is weak. It is an observation that such kinds of approaches are not successful in our context, {{because it is an}} observation that most of the students fail in mathematics. Therefore, the students perceive mathematics to be the most difficult subject. This problem is important, because as long as a reform in teaching approaches is not introduced, mathematics learning remains ineffective in schools. Thus, my aim was to search for such approaches which could be effective for student learning. Moreover, the purpose of this {{research was}} to improve my pedagogy and introduce an alternative approach in my own school, where mathematics is taught through teacher-centered approach. I selected the student-centered teaching approach (SCTA) for this purpose, so that I could study the process through which this approach affects students 2 ̆ 7 learning of mathematics. It came to my knowledge that some private schools of Karachi, Pakistan, are using the Student-Centered Teaching Approach (SCTA). I decided to conduct my research in a private secondary school to see how SCTA was being implemented in the mathematics classroom. I conducted a qualitative research there and my method was an exploratory case study. I chose two mathematics teachers. One was teaching class IV and the other was teaching class VI. I observed six teaching sessions of each of them, along with conducting post-observation discussions and three interviews. The findings revealed that teachers were aware of studentcentered teaching and the strategies of its implementation. It was found that the teachers were implementing SCTA to some extent, because they used problem-solving and asking questions as the strategies for implementation of SCTA. It also was found out that they had a limited understanding of using these strategies. The research participants did less than what they were claiming. Thus, the study recommends that if the teachers are provided with <b>concrete</b> <b>training</b> opportunities, their teaching practices regarding SCTA will improve significantly...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{increase}} the knowledge about children born to mothers with an intellectual or developmental disability by investigating incidence (Study I), support at the stra tegic level (Study II), support at the family level (Study III), and experiences of having grown up with a mother with a developmental disability (Study IV). The first study investigated the 5 -year incidence of children being born to mothers with an intellectua l disability in a Swedish county. Three types of registers were used, together with personal identification numbers. The resulting incidence rate, 2. 12 children per 1, 000 children indicates that there are currently approximately 4000 children (aged 0 - 18 years) that have been born to a mother with an intellectual disability in Sweden. Data for Studies II and III were collect ed by means of focus group interviews with 29 professionals supporting families with parental intellectual disability, and the data were analysed by means of content analysis. Study II described results on the strategic level of support; roles and activities of the professionals involved, identification of families in need, problems with identifying mothers with an intellectual disability, existing collaboration and dilemmas concerning legislative actions. The results indicated a rich web of support to these families {{from all kinds of}} welfare sectors, but further needs for building collaboration were identified, such as the need to coordinate education efforts. Study III described results on the family level of support: support practices, pedagogical strategies, and maintaining the child perspective. The results indicated the need for <b>concrete</b> <b>training,</b> the importance of involving the father/ partner, and the value of not losing the child perspective and of creating support practices with a clearer focus on the children. In Study IV, four women were interviewed about their experiences of growing up in a family with a mother who has a developmental disability. Narrative inquiry and content analysis were employed. The findings showed recollections of a vulnerable childhood filled with worries, fear, and anxiety, and with a strong feeling of responsibility. No effective support from the authorities was ever offered to the four informants, who dealt differently with their lives as adults with regard to their own family and children. The results of this thesis provide new knowledge about the complex situation of being a child in a family with maternal intellectual or developmental disability, and they may be used by staff in the welfare sectors in order to improve the visibility of these children and offer support adapted to the children's situation...|$|R
