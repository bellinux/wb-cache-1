50|$|In 1855 he {{was elected}} Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences, {{but at that time}} it {{provided}} no advantage in terms of material well-being, and he didn't even have an assistant at the museum. In the 1830s through the 1850s vast zoological collections were received by the museum from different regions of the Russian Empire, including Russian America, and through collection exchanges with foreign Museums, but there weren't enough <b>cabinets</b> <b>and</b> <b>cases.</b> Under such difficult conditions Menetries had done a lot primarily on beetles and butterflies.|$|E
50|$|The {{dwelling}} {{also shows}} how the sexes lived apart under one roof. Wide hallways separate the brethren's rooms from the sisters' rooms; separate doors and stairways {{for men and women}} meant that a sister never had to pass a brother going through those openings. Men and women ate at opposite ends of the dining room. The dwelling also has features unusual in habitations of their era; interior windows for borrowed light to illuminate an otherwise-dark stairwell, built-in <b>cabinets</b> <b>and</b> <b>cases</b> of drawers, dumb-waiters for moving food and dishes between the downstairs kitchen and the dining room on the floor above, an abundance of windows for light and ventilation. All of the windows in the building, rather than having a 90 degree angle with the wall, form a 45 (approx.) degree angle in the wall, which allows approximately 30 percent more light into the buildingâ€”something that significantly keep the electrical bills low while experiencing more natural light.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} ways to prevent damage from occurring to taxidermy collections is to establish a monitoring system or procedure that routinely checks the condition of specimens. When not on display, taxidermy specimens should be housed in well-sealed cabinets or cases. Metal cabinets may be made of aluminum and/or stainless steel with an epoxy powder coating and are effective at preventing pest and light damage. Wood cabinets can provide better protection from fluctuations in relative humidity, though they off-gas chemicals that may damage collections. Though it is essential for <b>cabinets</b> <b>and</b> <b>cases</b> to be well-sealed, they should also allow for minimal airflow to prevent off-gassed chemicals or humidity from building up inside the container. For taxidermy specimens housed on open shelving, a polythene sheet can provide temporary protection from pollutants, though dust may accumulate electrostatically (2).Controlled lighting conditions with UV filters are important for reducing fading in taxidermy specimens. Specimens should be regularly rotated in order to reduce light damage. 50-100 lux is the recommended light exposure for taxidermy, though some types of feathers are susceptible to damage at 50 lux. The maximum annual exposure levels for biological specimens, feathers, fur, and leather is 180,000 lux hours. In the span of one year, a taxidermy mount will fade half as much if displayed in low light compared to the same conditions in high light. Ideal relative humidity conditions for taxidermy specimens are 40% minimum and 55% maximum. An integrated pest management system is important to manage and monitor pests that can damage collections.|$|E

50|$|In 1988, BHS {{moved into}} its current home, the Garfield School {{on the corner}} of Brunswick Road (New York State Route 2) and Moonlawn Road. Extensive renovations were made to the {{building}} to bring it to a suitable standard for visiting researchers and other parties interested in what BHS had to offer. The school was originally the District No. 2 Schoolhouse, which serviced Eagle Mills from its construction in 1881 until the consolidation of the Brunswick (Brittonkill) Central School District in 1956. The school had been used occasionally by the school district after consolidation, but it had effectively been abandoned until the district transferred it to the Town of Brunswick in 1986. In 1988, the Garfield School became the first building {{to be added to the}} National Register of Historical Places in the town of Brunswick. In 2009, after more than 20 years sharing the building, the Brunswick Community Library moved to a new location east of the Garfield Library. In response, BHS expanded its operation into the entire Garfield School. In 2010, an extensive renovation was performed, including refinishing the wood floors <b>and</b> installing new <b>cabinets</b> <b>and</b> display <b>cases.</b>|$|R

50|$|To {{construct}} a device {{takes more than}} knowledge of circuits, many would urge that the mechanical aspects of <b>cabinets,</b> <b>cases</b> <b>and</b> chassis' are the most time consuming aspects of audio DIY. Drilling, metalworking and physical measurements are critical to constructing almost any DIY audio project, especially speakers. Measuring equipment such as a Vernier caliper is often essential. Woodworking skills are required to construct wooden enclosures (e.g. for speakers), with some enthusiasts going beyond traditional woodworking to CNC lathing, and luxurious veneers and lacquers. Room acoustics solutions are also popular among DIYers, {{as they can be}} made with inexpensive and readily available insulating materials, and can be dimensioned to fit each particular room in a precise and aesthetically pleasing way.|$|R

They are mostly longcase clocks, the cheapest with 30-hour movements in modest oak cases, but some have high quality eight-day movements with additional features, such as showing the high tide at Bristol docks.
