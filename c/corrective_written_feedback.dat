30|$|This paper {{investigated}} how {{written feedback}} can be theorized as a mediation tool based on Vygotsky’s ([1978]) notions of scaffolding and ZPD. To reach this aim, the paper discussed four approaches to feedback. The {{first one was}} SLA, which was followed by L 2 W. Both of these approaches investigate the role and effectiveness of <b>corrective</b> <b>written</b> <b>feedback.</b> On the other hand, the SCT and the Sydney School approaches, which are quite closely relate to each other, explore feedback as a mediation tool to correct and as well as support students. While the SCT approach focus on oral language development, the Sydney School approach research written language development. The feedback instances {{presented in this paper}} were analyzed using two topologies; the feedback and students’ response to feedback topologies. The paper concluded with a discussion section as to why the theorization of written feedback presented here is more productive in understanding literacy development as opposed to the other approaches.|$|E

However, research on video-based <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> (VWCF) in EFL/ESL writing instructions so far has only revealed its qualitative strengths (Stannard, 2008; Mathisen, 2012) —that is, in terms of students’ responses towards its application, a gap that the current paper intends to address.

This {{study was conducted in}} 3 stages; pre-test, treatment, and post-test. Feedback was provided in treatment stage where group one students received direct corrective feedback while group two students received indirect corrective feedback. The errors made on each stage were marked and counted to be used to compare among each stage of their writings as well as between the two groups. The results showed that students who received direct corrective feedback outperformed students who received indirect corrective feedback in the post-test. In addition, the results also showed that although the mean number of errors made by indirect feedback group did not decrease in post-test, the mean number of errors made decrease in their revised texts. Thus, it can be concluded that indirect corrective feedback was an effective tool in helping students retaining their language learning over a period of time. Interviews were also conducted to gain insights on other factors that affect students’ writing performance. Based on the results gained, two themes which influence the effectiveness of <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> on students’ <b>writing</b> are motivation and scaffolding. Three anecdotal findings were also collected through the interviews. They are related to students expressing their concern on content-related knowledge when writing an essay.

40|$|Conducted in an {{intermediate}} English {{as a second}} language (ESL) setting {{at the high school level}} in Quebec, this correlational study investigated the relationship between instructor feedback and English second language (L 2) students’ writing anxiety. Participants were 53 teenagers in their last year of high school who were required to write an end of year integrative high stakes writing exam. Throughout the five-month period, students were exposed to two practice integrative tasks, <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback,</b> and five questionnaires to measure language learning anxiety, L 2 writing anxiety, and participants’ perception of instructor feedback. The results showed a significant, negative correlation between students’ perceptions of feedback and test anxiety. These findings have pedagogical implications which suggest that anxious learners might benefit from feedback to decrease their anxiety for high stakes exams, provided that the <b>written</b> <b>feedback</b> is clear...|$|R
