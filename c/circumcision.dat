5|$|A 2017 {{systematic}} review found consistent evidence that <b>circumcision</b> {{was associated with}} a decreased risk of cervical cancer, cervical dysplasia, HSV-2, chlamydia, and syphilis among women.

5|$|Although {{there is}} some debate within Islam over {{whether it is a}} {{religious}} requirement, <b>circumcision</b> (called khitan) is practiced nearly universally by Muslim males. Islam bases its practice of <b>circumcision</b> on the Genesis 17 narrative, the same Biblical chapter referred to by Jews. The procedure is not explicitly mentioned in the Quran, however, it is a tradition established by Islam's prophet Muhammad directly (following Abraham), and so its practice is considered a sunnah (prophet's tradition) and is very important in Islam. For Muslims, <b>circumcision</b> is also a matter of cleanliness, purification and control over one's baser self (nafs). There is no agreement across the many Islamic communities about the age at which <b>circumcision</b> should be performed. It may be done from soon after birth up to about age 15; most often it is performed at around six to seven years of age. The timing can correspond with the boy's completion of his recitation of the whole Quran, with a coming-of-age event such as taking on the responsibility of daily prayer or betrothal. <b>Circumcision</b> may be celebrated with an associated family or community event. <b>Circumcision</b> is recommended for, but is not required of, converts to Islam.|$|E
5|$|<b>Circumcision</b> {{may be used}} {{to treat}} {{pathological}} phimosis, refractory balanoposthitis and chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). The World Health Organization promotes <b>circumcision</b> to prevent female-to-male HIV transmission in countries with high rates of HIV. The International Antiviral Society-USA also suggests <b>circumcision</b> be discussed with MSM who engage in primarily insertive anal sex, especially in areas where HIV is common.|$|E

5|$|The {{available}} evidence {{does not indicate}} that <b>circumcision</b> provides HIV protection for heterosexual women. Data is lacking regarding the effect <b>circumcision</b> may have on the transmission rate of men who engage in anal sex with a female partner. It is undetermined whether <b>circumcision</b> benefits {{men who have sex}} with men.|$|E
5|$|The {{highest quality}} {{evidence}} indicates that <b>circumcision</b> does not decrease {{the sensitivity of the}} penis, harm sexual function or reduce sexual satisfaction. A 2013 systematic review found that <b>circumcision</b> did not appear to adversely affect sexual desire, pain with intercourse, premature ejaculation, time until ejaculation, erectile dysfunction or difficulties with orgasm. However, the study found that the existing evidence is not very good. Another 2013 systematic review found that the highest-quality studies reported no adverse effects of <b>circumcision</b> on sexual function, sensitivity, sensation or satisfaction. A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis found that <b>circumcision</b> did not affect premature ejaculation.|$|E
5|$|The {{positions}} of the world's major medical organizations range from considering elective <b>circumcision</b> of babies and children as having no benefit and significant risks to having a modest health benefit that outweighs small risks. No major medical organization recommends either universal <b>circumcision</b> of all males or banning the procedure. Ethical and legal questions regarding informed consent and human rights have been raised over the <b>circumcision</b> of babies and children for non-medical reasons; for these reasons the procedure is controversial.|$|E

5|$|The {{prosecutor}} alleges than in Nakuru forty five {{cases of}} sexual violence were reported including rapes, forced male <b>circumcisions</b> and penile amputation.

5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that <b>circumcision</b> is associated with lower risk of prostate cancer.

5|$|Certain African {{cultural}} groups, {{such as the}} Yoruba and the Igbo of Nigeria, customarily circumcise their infant sons. The {{procedure is}} also practiced by some cultural groups or individual family lines in the Sudan, Zaire, Uganda and in southern Africa. For some of these groups, <b>circumcision</b> appears to be purely cultural, done with no particular religious significance or intention to distinguish members of a group. For others, <b>circumcision</b> might be done for purification, {{or it may be}} interpreted as a mark of subjugation. Among these groups, even when <b>circumcision</b> is done for reasons of tradition, it is often done in hospitals. It is not clear how many deaths and injuries result from traditional circumcisions which occur outside of hospitals.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to proposing that <b>circumcision</b> {{was taken up}} by the Israelites purely as a religious mandate, scholars have suggested that Judaism's patriarchs and their followers adopted <b>circumcision</b> to make penile hygiene easier in hot, sandy climates; as a rite of passage into adulthood; or as a form of blood sacrifice.|$|E

5|$|Studies {{evaluating}} {{the effect of}} <b>circumcision</b> on the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections have reached conflicting conclusions. A 2006 meta-analysis found that <b>circumcision</b> was associated with lower rates of syphilis, chancroid and possibly genital herpes. A 2010 review found that <b>circumcision</b> reduced the incidence of HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus, type 2) infections by 28%. The researchers found mixed results for protection against trichomonas vaginalis and chlamydia trachomatis and no evidence of protection against gonorrhea or syphilis. Among {{men who have sex}} with men, reviews have found poor evidence for protection against sexually transmitted infections other than HIV, with the possible exception of syphilis.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the {{migration}} and evolution {{of the practice of}} <b>circumcision</b> is followed mainly through the cultures and peoples in two separate regions. In the lands south and east of the Mediterranean, starting with Sudan and Ethiopia, the procedure was practiced by the ancient Egyptians and the Semites, and then by the Jews and Muslims, with whom the practice travelled to and was adopted by the Bantu Africans. In Oceania, <b>circumcision</b> is practiced by the Australian Aborigines and Polynesians. There is also evidence that <b>circumcision</b> was practiced among the Aztec and Mayan civilizations in the Americas, but little detail is available about its history.|$|E

5|$|The {{practice}} of <b>circumcision</b> {{is thought to}} have been brought to the Bantu-speaking tribes of Africa by either the Jews after one of their many expulsions from European countries, or by Muslim Moors escaping after the 1492 conquest of Spain. In {{the second half of the}} 1st millennium CE, inhabitants from the North East of Africa moved south and encountered groups from Arabia, the Middle East, and West Africa. These people moved south and formed what is known today as the Bantu. Bantu tribes were observed to be upholding what was described as Jewish law, including <b>circumcision,</b> in the 16th century. <b>Circumcision</b> and elements of Jewish dietary restrictions are still found among Bantu tribes.|$|E
5|$|Though secular {{scholars}} {{consider the}} story to be literary and not historical, <b>circumcision</b> features prominently in the Hebrew Bible. The narrative in Genesis chapter 17 describes the <b>circumcision</b> of Abraham and his relatives and slaves. In the same chapter, Abraham's descendants are commanded to circumcise their sons on the eighth day of life {{as part of a}} covenant with God.|$|E
5|$|<b>Circumcision</b> has a {{protective}} effect against {{the risks of}} penile cancer in men, and cervical cancer in the female sexual partners of heterosexual men. Penile cancer is rare, with about 1 new case per 100,000 people per year in developed countries and higher incidence rates per 100,000 in sub-Saharan Africa (for example: 1.6 in Zimbabwe, 2.7 in Uganda and 3.2 in Swaziland). The number of new cases is also high in certain South American countries such as Paraguay and Uruguay at about 4.3 per 100,000. It is least common in Israeli Jews—0.1 per 100,000—related {{in part to the}} very high rate of <b>circumcision</b> of babies.|$|E

During every initiation season, reports are made of advanced infections, severe blood loss, mutilation and even death.
