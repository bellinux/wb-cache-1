50|$|Upjohn {{stood to}} open up a whole new arena of {{treatment}} for diabetes, one with a built-in and sustainable market, i.e. patient population. Just as two German companies brought sulfonylureas to market within the same year, Upjohn discovered Eli Lilly had begun clinical trials for <b>carbutamide,</b> another oral hypoglycemic. Upjohn pushed for large-scale clinical trials from 1955-1957, enrolling over 5,000 patients at multiple sites.|$|E
5000|$|Hellmuth Kleinsorge studied {{medicine}} in Jena. In 1953, after his dissertation and habilitation, he became {{director of the}} [...] "Medizinische Poliklinik in Jena". In 1958 - 1960 he was also head of the medical faculty of Jena University (then in the German Democratic Republic).

5000|$|Upjohn's {{formulation}} was preferred {{when the}} Lilly formulation demonstrated evidence of toxicity in parallel trials at the Joslin Clinic. Lilly pulled <b>carbutamide</b> and halted development, leaving the field open for Upjohn to market its new treatment. In 1956, Upjohn filed for {{approval from the}} Food and Drug Administration. Jeremy A. Greene found the application's size - 10,580 pages in 23 volumes with 5,786 cases reports - was necessary to [...] "render visible the relatively small improvements provided in less severe forms of diabetes." [...] Indeed, Orinase was marketed by Upjohn not as a cure-all for all diabetics, but specifically as a treatment that was [...] "not an oral insulin" [...] and [...] "did not work in all diabetics". Those were the instructions for marketing given to Upjohn's salespeople. As indicated by the FDA application, Orinase had been demonstrated [...] "not {{to be effective in}} severe diabetes, but only in milder cases of the disease." [...] Orinase was one of a new class of drugs (including treatments for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia) aimed at providing marginal benefits over existing treatments for patients who had not previously been a target market for pharmaceuticals.|$|E
40|$|The glucose uptake {{of the rat}} {{diaphragm}} {{has been}} determined {{in the presence of}} the plasma of young volunteers before and after administration of <b>carbutamide</b> without and with added insulin. The increase in the glucose uptake of the rat diaphragm due to the added plasma above that in the medium alone has been termed plasma effect. The increase in the glucose uptake of the rat diaphragm with plasma and added insulin above that with only insulin in the medium has been termed plasma+insulin effect. There was a significant increase in the plasma effect and the plasma+insulin effect after <b>carbutamide</b> administration. The increase in the plasma+insulin effect was significantly greater than the increase in the plasma effect. From these observations it has been suggested that <b>carbutamide</b> potentiates the action of insulin peripherally. Observed facts about <b>carbutamide</b> do not contradict this mechanism of action...|$|E

40|$|Tolbutamide and <b>carbutamide</b> given orally to fasted rats cause {{a rise in}} {{the liver}} {{glycogen}} content 1 ½ to 3 ½ hr. after administration of the drugs. Glycogen accumulates preferentially in the right lobe. Subcutaneously injected tolbutamide has the same effect. Both sulphonylureas cause inhibition of glucose- 6 -phosphatase activity of rat liver homogenates in vitro, but at drug concentrations comparable with those found in plasma of treated patients the degree of inhibition is less than 10 %. Livers from treated rats show normal glucose- 6 -phosphatase activity. The glucose uptake of the isolated rat diaphragm is unaffected by the sulphonylureas added in vitro. Diaphragms from treated rats show normal glucose uptake in {{the presence or absence of}} insulin. The inferences to be drawn from these results are discussed in the light of previous work. It is concluded that the sulphonylureas exert hypoglycaemic action by inhibiting glycogenolysis and it is suggested that they might do so by inhibiting release of glucagon from the pancreas...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} previously that chlorpropamide and other hypoglycemic sulfonylureas interfere with hepatic triglyceride breakdown. Since ketogenesis from endogenous hepatic lipid stores {{is a measure of}} hepatic triglyceride hydrolysis, ketogenesis derived from endogenous lipids as well as ketogenesis derived from exogenously added isotopic oleate was determined in isolated hepatocytes from fasted rats in an attempt to identify the nature of the direct effects of sulfonylureas on hepatic lipid metabolism. Ketogenesis from endogenous lipids was inhibited by 1 mM chlorpropamide, while ketone production from exogenous oleate did not change. The effect of chlorpropamide on hepatic triglyceride metabolism was further studied in the isolated perfused liver of normal rats {{in the presence of a}} continuous [3 H]oleate infusion and in isolated liver cells incubated in the presence of [3 H]oleate. In liver perfusion experiments, 1 mM chlorpropamide enhanced the incorporation of tritium into triglycerides (but not other lipid classes) and increased both liver triglyceride content and triglyceride secretion. Using isolated cells similar effects could be demonstrated at 0. 5 mM chlorpropamide. Chlorpropamide, tolbutamide, and <b>carbutamide,</b> all of which inhibited endogenous ketogenesis in isolated liver cells, also inhibited lysosomal triglyceride lipase activity in rat liver homogenates. The drugs were not inhibitory towards alkaline lipase activity. Demethylglycodiazin (2 -benzolsulfonamid [...] 5 -(beta-hydroxyethoxy) -pyrimidin), which did not inhibit endogenous ketogenesis in isolated liver cells, did not affect lysosomal lipase activity. The lysosomotropic drug chloroquine was markedly antiketogenic when tested in liver cells. The reduction in endogenous ketogenesis, the enhanced accumulation of liver triglycerides, and the stimulation of hepatic triglyceride output by chlorpropamide are ascribed to an interference of the drug with hepatic triglyceride breakdown. The present results also suggest that the lysosomes play a significant role in hepatic lipolysis. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This project {{report is}} {{submitted}} in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Pharmacy, 2015 Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 66 - 70). Diabetes, a persistent endocrine disorder causing high rate of mortality, has been treated with adequate methods for {{the last hundred years}} after the discovery of insulin by Banting and Best though its clinical features were first described by the Egyptians 3000 years ago. The effective treatment strategies started to develop when the first oral hypoglycemic drugs, tolbutamide and <b>carbutamide,</b> came into the market. Presently, the establishment of new methods and strategies of combination therapy is considered to be more convenient over monotherapy. The main objective of this current study was to estimate a DPP- 4 inhibitor named sitagliptin either alone or in a combination formulation with metformin. The quality of both available single and combination tablets of local companies with the innovator brand were also compared. The method followed for the determination of sitagliptin employed a RP‐HPLC procedure with PDA detector consisting of Luna 5 μ C 18 column (250 mm x 4. 60 mm) inserting an injection volume of 10 μL and eluted by the mobile phase of 0. 02 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate (pH 4) and acetonitrile in a ratio of 60 : 40 respectively, which is pumped at a flow rate of 1. 0 mL/min. The method carried out the detection at a wavelength of 252 nm for the binary mixture and of 210 nm for the single sitagliptin; and had the elution time of 3. 45 and 2. 28 minutes for sitagliptin and metformin respectively. All the values for system suitability parameters were also feasible with this method. The release kinetics profile of sitagliptin was very precise and accurate and can be concluded that this method is suitable for any tablet containing sitagliptin in the routine analysis of quality control laboratory.

40|$|The {{structure}} activity relationships for the insulin secretagogues N-benzoyl-D-phenylalanine (NBDP) {{and related}} compounds were examined at the sulphonylurea receptor level {{by use of}} cultured HIT-T 15 and mouse pancreatic β-cells. The affinities of these compounds for the sulphonylurea receptor were compared with their potencies for KATP-channel inhibition. In addition, the effects of cytosolic nucleotides on KATP-channel inhibition by NBDP were investigated. NBDP displayed a dissociation constant for binding to the sulphonylurea receptor (KD value) of 11 [*]μM and half-maximally effective concentrations of KATP-channel inhibition (EC 50 values) between 2 and 4 [*]μM ({{in the absence of}} cytosolic nucleotides or presence of 0. 1 [*]mM GDP or 1 [*]mM ADP). In the absence of cytosolic nucleotides or presence of GDP (0. 1 [*]mM) maximally effective concentrations of NBDP (0. 1 – 1 [*]mM) reduced KATP-channel activity to 47 % and 44 % of control, respectively. In the presence of ADP (1 [*]mM), KATP-channel activity was completely suppressed by 0. 1 [*]mM NBDP. The L-isomer of N-benzoyl-phenylalanine displayed a 20 fold lower affinity and an 80 fold lower potency than the D-isomer. Introduction of a p-nitro substituent in the D-phenylalanine moiety of NBDP did not decrease lipophilicity but lowered affinity and potency by more than 30 fold. Introduction of a p-amino substituent in the D-phenylalanine moiety of NBDP (N-benzoyl-p-amino-D-phenylalanine, NBADP) reduced lipophilicity and lowered affinity and potency by about 10 fold. This loss of affinity and potency was compensated for by formation of the phenylpropionic acid derivative of NBADP. A similar difference in affinity was observed for the sulphonylurea <b>carbutamide</b> and its phenylpropionic acid derivative. Replacing the benzene ring in the D-phenylalanine moiety of NBDP by a cyclohexyl ring increased lipophilicity, and the KD and EC 50 values were slightly lower than for NBDP. Exchange of both benzene rings in NBDP by cyclohexyl rings further increased lipophilicity without altering affinity and potency. This study shows that N-acylphenylalanines interact with the sulphonylurea receptor of pancreatic β-cells in a stereospecific manner. Their potency depends on lipophilic but not aromatic properties of their benzene rings. As observed for sulphonylureas, interaction of N-acylphenylalanines with the sulphonylurea receptor does not induce complete inhibition of KATP-channel activity in the absence of inhibitory cytosolic nucleotides...|$|E
