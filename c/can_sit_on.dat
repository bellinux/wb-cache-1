25|$|Foodar is a Canadian cat who has {{a bizarre}} radar-like-seventh sense (according to Bucky all cats have 6, the sixth being knowing which humans are afraid of them or dislike them so they <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> their laps) {{that allows him to}} detect food from up to several meters away (though he doesn't bother {{detecting}} fruit or vegetables).

25|$|The {{most common}} kind is the Brawler. Brawlers <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> a downed {{opponent}} and punch their opponent's head repeatedly. They {{also have a}} special combination of 3 to 5 strikes. If the first strike connects, the defending wrestler {{is not able to}} block, avoid or counter the remainder of the strikes in the combination. Their special ability is called 'Wreck Shop', a limited adrenaline rush in which all opponent strikes are countered and all strikes become unblockable.|$|E

Drivers are required to pick up the first or closest passenger they see, and may not refuse a trip to a destination anywhere within the five boroughs, neighboring Westchester or Nassau, or Newark Liberty International Airport.

25|$|In December 2009 Alison Grieve, a 32-year-old {{waitress}} and event manager from Bruntsfield, Edinburgh, {{witnessed a}} waitress drop a tray full of glasses of champagne at a corporate event for {{a delegation of}} international lawyers. To address how a tray could right itself {{at the moment of}} impending tilt, Grieve, a first-time inventor with a university background in 'History of film and photography', developed a finger receiver attached to the bottom of a wait tray based on first-principle physics, load dispersal, and counter movement. In a closed position, the finger receiver lays flush with the bottom of the wait tray so that the tray <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the surface of a bar or table without wobbling and can be stacked onto other trays. When the device is open, two slots can be accessed into which a waitperson may secure their two inside fingers, similar to how a flip-flop structurally attaches itself between the toes of the foot to counter the large stresses place upon it. The Safetray product's arrangement creates a strong cantilever advantage for the waitperson to allow them additional control over torque caused by items placed in various locations around the tray. The stability achieved with the Safetray product allows a waitperson to place a bottle of wine right {{at the edge of the}} tray while still keeping the tray in a horizontal position by reacting instinctively against the bottle's off-balance downward force.|$|E
500|$|... "Simple Kind of Life" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Rolling Stone described the song as being [...] "at once grand, fragile and very, very sad" [...] and commented that [...] "it's clear this woman whom many desire but few {{regard as a}} serious artist has penned a song that <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the same shelf {{with the likes of}} Elliott Smith and Aimee Mann." [...] Entertainment Weekly characterized the song as [...] "manicured power pop" [...] with a melody [...] "buttery to the point of melting". [...] It later included the song in a list of No Doubt's top five songs, referring to it as [...] "musically understated (layered guitar strumming and a melancholy melody), but lyrically devastating." [...] Slant Magazine found the song's melodic structure odd, but was pleased by how it [...] "unabashedly delivers double-takes". [...] "Simple Kind of Life" [...] was listed at number twenty-eight on the 2000 Pazz & Jop list, a survey of several hundred music critics conducted by Robert Christgau.|$|E

The subjects discussed here include the human ancestral tree, water and its significance to life, the mysteries of cellular life, 'the secret and remote abysses' of the sea, the riddle of why human beings alone among living creatures have brains capable of abstract thought and are far superior to their mere needs for survival, the reasons why Dr. Eiseley is convinced that there are no men or man-like animals on other planets, ...".|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{exercises}} {{that can be done to}} strengthen the lower leg. For example, in order to activate plantar flexors in the deep plantar flexors one <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the floor with the hips flexed, the ankle neutral with knees fully extended as they alternate pushing their foot against a wall or platform. This kind of exercise is beneficial as it hardly causes any fatigue. [...] Another form of isometric exercise for the gastrocnemius would be seated calf raises which can be done with or without equipment. One can be seated at a table with their feet flat on the ground, and then plantar flex both ankles so that the heels are raised off the floor and the gastrocnemius flexed. An alternate movement could be heel drop exercises with the toes being propped on an elevated surface—as an opposing movement this would improve the range of motion. One-legged toe raises for the gastrocnemius muscle can be performed by holding one dumbbell in one hand while using the other for balance, and then standing with one foot on a plate. The next step would be to plantar flex and keep the knee joint straight or flexed slightly. The triceps surae is contracted during this exercise. Stabilization exercises like the BOSU ball squat are also important especially as they assist in the ankles having to adjust to the ball’s form in order to balance.|$|E

I mean there's certain musicians who have nothing better to do than complain, People, that can't feel fortunate for what they have been given, and if you don't want it, then fucking just quit and get away from it.

I don't want to complain about anything, I want people to know that I'm happy doing what I'm doing.
