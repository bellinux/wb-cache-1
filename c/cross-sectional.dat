5|$|As {{the name}} suggests, an {{elliptical}} galaxy has the <b>cross-sectional</b> {{shape of an}} ellipse. The stars move along random orbits with no preferred direction. These galaxies contain little or no interstellar dust, few star-forming regions, and generally older stars. Elliptical galaxies are more commonly found {{at the core of}} galactic clusters, and may have been formed through mergers of large galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms of lead {{poisoning}} include nephropathy, colic-like abdominal pains, and possibly {{weakness in the}} fingers, wrists, or ankles. Small blood pressure increases, particularly in middle-aged and older people, may be apparent and can cause anemia. Several studies, mostly <b>cross-sectional,</b> found an association between increased lead exposure and decreased heart rate variability. In pregnant women, high levels of exposure to lead may cause miscarriage. Chronic, high-level exposure {{has been shown to}} reduce fertility in males.|$|E
5|$|The {{galaxy is}} {{inclined}} an estimated 77° {{relative to the}} Earth (where an angle of 90° would be viewed directly from the side). Analysis of the <b>cross-sectional</b> shape of the galaxy appears to demonstrate a pronounced, S-shaped warp, rather than just a flat disk. A possible cause of such a warp could be gravitational interaction with the satellite galaxies near the Andromeda Galaxy. The Galaxy M33 could be responsible for some warp in Andromeda's arms, though more precise distances and radial velocities are required.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the MSE is to obtain a {{comprehensive}} <b>cross-sectional</b> description of the patient's mental state, which, when combined with the biographical and historical information of the psychiatric history, allows the clinician to make an accurate diagnosis and formulation, which are required for coherent treatment planning.|$|E
5|$|The {{softness}} of copper partly explains its high electrical conductivity (59.6×106S/m) and high thermal conductivity, second highest (second only to silver) among pure metals at room temperature. This {{is because the}} resistivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature originates primarily from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice, which are relatively weak in a soft metal. The maximum permissible current density of copper in open air is approximately 3.1×106A/m2 of <b>cross-sectional</b> area, above which it begins to heat excessively.|$|E
5|$|The west front {{rises in}} three {{distinct}} stages, each clearly {{defined by a}} horizontal course. This horizontal emphasis is counteracted by six strongly projecting buttresses defining the <b>cross-sectional</b> divisions of nave, aisles and towers, and are highly decorated, each having canopied niches containing the largest statues on the façade.|$|E
25|$|The {{extrusion}} ratio {{is defined as}} the starting <b>cross-sectional</b> area divided by the <b>cross-sectional</b> area of the final extrusion. One of the main advantages of the extrusion process is that this ratio can be very large while still producing quality parts.|$|E
25|$|The arch has a <b>cross-sectional</b> {{diameter}} {{greater than}} that of a cross-channel Eurostar train.|$|E
25|$|AWG gauges {{are also}} used to {{describe}} stranded wire. In this case, it describes a wire which is equal in <b>cross-sectional</b> area to the total of all the <b>cross-sectional</b> areas of the individual strands; the gaps between strands are not counted. When made with circular strands, these gaps occupy about 10% of the wire area, thus requiring a wire about 5% thicker than equivalent solid wire.|$|E
25|$|This process isn't as {{versatile}} {{as direct}} extrusions because the <b>cross-sectional</b> area {{is limited by}} the maximum size of the stem.|$|E
25|$|MRI (magnetic {{resonance}} imaging)--A {{non-invasive procedure}} {{in which a}} machine produces a series of <b>cross-sectional</b> images of the shoulder.|$|E
25|$|National <b>cross-sectional</b> {{data suggest}} an inverse {{relation}} between religious diversity and happiness, possibly by facilitating more bonding (and less bridging) social capital.|$|E
25|$|A {{longitudinal}} study {{is one that}} follows test subjects {{over a long period}} of time — as opposed to a <b>cross-sectional</b> study, which gives a 'snap-shot' of a group at one point in time. Longitudinal studies tend to examine smaller groups in greater detail, whereas <b>cross-sectional</b> studies are often based on a more representative segment of the population over a short time. The longitudinal method was useful in identifying factors in alcoholism, for instance by investigating whether delinquent behaviour started before or after drinking.|$|E
25|$|The {{terminal}} velocity {{of an object}} changes due to {{the properties of the}} fluid, the mass of the object and its projected <b>cross-sectional</b> surface area.|$|E
25|$|However, it {{has been}} shown that the widely {{accepted}} WHO and American Diabetes Association diagnostic cutoff for diabetes of a fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0mmol/l (126mg/dl) does not accurately identify diabetic retinopathy among patients. The cohort study included a multi-ethnic, <b>cross-sectional</b> adult population sample in the US, as well as two <b>cross-sectional</b> adult populations in Australia. For the US-based component of the study, the sensitivity was 34.7% and specificity was 86.6%. For patients at similar risk to those in this study (15.8% had diabetic retinopathy), this leads to a positive predictive value of 32.7% and negative predictive value of 87.6%.|$|E
25|$|On an {{extremity}} {{such as a}} finger, {{there is}} limited <b>cross-sectional</b> area to disperse the current, a circumstance which might result in higher current density and some heating throughout {{the volume of the}} extremity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cross-sectional</b> studies {{illustrate}} {{the link between}} emotional approach coping and positive psychological adjustment, under certain conditions in student and community samples. In a <b>cross-sectional</b> study of undergraduate women, women who scored more highly on emotional approach coping reported more positive and less negative valenced repetitive thoughts. In a community sample of African-American adults, emotional approach coping has also {{been found to be}} negatively associated with anger, trait anxiety and depressive symptoms. In addition, women who reported higher dispositional emotional processing also reported fewer depressive and anxious symptoms and greater life satisfaction; while for men, higher dispositional emotional expression was linked to greater life satisfaction.|$|E
25|$|A <b>cross-sectional</b> {{study in}} humans {{suggests}} that serum SOD {{could be a}} marker of cardiovascular alterations in hypertensive and diabetic patients, since changes in its serum levels are correlated with alterations in vascular structure and function.|$|E
25|$|An {{object of}} uniform cross section has a {{resistance}} proportional to its resistivity and length and {{inversely proportional to}} its <b>cross-sectional</b> area. All materials show some resistance, except for superconductors, which have a resistance of zero.|$|E
25|$|As a {{compromise}} between large egg size and small cross-section. Large size allows quick development of the chick. Small <b>cross-sectional</b> area allows the adult bird to have a small cross-section and therefore reduce drag when swimming.|$|E
25|$|Darcy's {{law is a}} {{constitutive}} equation, empirically {{derived by}} Henry Darcy in 1856, which states {{that the amount of}} groundwater discharging through a given portion of aquifer is proportional to the <b>cross-sectional</b> area of flow, the hydraulic gradient, and the hydraulic conductivity.|$|E
25|$|These are {{avalanche}} diodes {{designed specifically}} to protect other semiconductor devices from high-voltage transients. Their p–n junctions have a much larger <b>cross-sectional</b> area than those of a normal diode, allowing them to conduct large currents to ground without sustaining damage.|$|E
25|$|Optical Coherence Tomography, or ‘OCT’, is a {{technique}} for obtaining sub-surface images of translucent or opaque materials at a resolution equivalent to a low-power microscope. It is effectively ‘optical ultrasound’, imaging reflections from within tissue to provide <b>cross-sectional</b> images.|$|E
25|$|Babinet's {{paradox is}} that {{contrary}} to naïve expectations, {{the amount of}} radiation removed from a beam in the diffraction limit is equal to twice the <b>cross-sectional</b> area. This is because there are two separate processes which remove radiation from the beam in equal amounts: absorption and diffraction.|$|E
25|$|Numerous studies linking edentulism with {{instances}} {{of disease and}} medical conditions have been reported. In a <b>cross-sectional</b> study, Hamasha and others found significant differences between edentulous and dentate individuals with respect to rates of atherosclerotic vascular disease, heart failure, ischemic heart disease and joint disease.|$|E
25|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT): This is {{an optical}} imaging modality based upon interference, and analogous to ultrasound. It produces <b>cross-sectional</b> {{images of the}} retina (B-scans) {{which can be used}} to measure the thickness of the retina and to resolve its major layers, allowing the observation of swelling.|$|E
25|$|The term drag area {{derives from}} aerodynamics, {{where it is}} the product of some {{reference}} area (such as <b>cross-sectional</b> area, total surface area, or similar) and the drag coefficient. In 2003, Car and Driver magazine adopted this metric as a more intuitive way to compare the aerodynamic efficiency of various automobiles.|$|E
25|$|The exact peak age {{of fluid}} {{intelligence}} or crystallized intelligence remains elusive. <b>Cross-sectional</b> studies usually show that especially fluid intelligence peaks {{at a relatively}} young age (often in the early adulthood) while longitudinal data mostly show that intelligence is stable until the mid adulthood or later. Subsequently, intelligence seems to decline slowly.|$|E
25|$|In a <b>cross-sectional</b> study, it {{was found}} that the {{confidence}} people have in the accuracy of their memory remains relatively constant across age groups, despite the memory impairment that occurs in other forms of memory in the elderly. This is likely the reason why the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon becomes more common with age.|$|E
25|$|A {{combination}} of ballasted and slab track are used, with slab track exclusively employed on concrete bed sections such as viaducts and tunnels. Slab track is significantly more cost-effective in tunnel sections, since the lower track height reduces the <b>cross-sectional</b> {{area of the}} tunnel, thereby reducing construction costs by up to 30%.|$|E
25|$|This {{reflectivity}} profile, {{called an}} A-scan, contains {{information about the}} spatial dimensions and location of structures within the item of interest. A <b>cross-sectional</b> tomograph (B-scan) may be achieved by laterally combining a series of these axial depth scans (A-scan). A face imaging at an acquired depth is possible depending on the imaging engine used.|$|E
25|$|The AWG {{tables are}} for a single, solid, round conductor. The AWG of a {{stranded}} wire {{is determined by the}} <b>cross-sectional</b> area of the equivalent solid conductor. Because there are also small gaps between the strands, a stranded wire will always have a slightly larger overall diameter than a solid wire with the same AWG.|$|E
25|$|The CPS {{began in}} 1940, and {{responsibility}} for conducting the CPS {{was given to the}} Census Bureau in 1942. In 1994 the CPS was redesigned. CPS is a survey that is: employment-focused, enumerator-conducted, continuous, and <b>cross-sectional.</b> The BLS increased the sample size by 10,000 as of July 2001. The sample represents the civilian noninstitutional population.|$|E
25|$|The Preston {{curve is}} an {{empirical}} <b>cross-sectional</b> relationship between life expectancy and real per capita income. It {{is named after}} Samuel H. Preston who first described it in 1975. Preston studied the relationship for the 1900s, 1930s and the 1960s and found it held {{for each of the}} three decades. More recent work has updated this research.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cross-sectional</b> {{shape of}} the hob teeth are almost the same shape as teeth of a rack gear {{that would be used}} with the {{finished}} product. There are slight changes to the shape for generating purposes, such as extending the hob's tooth length to create a clearance in the gear's roots. Each hob tooth is relieved on the back side to reduce friction.|$|E
25|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT scanning) is {{a medical}} imaging modality where tomographic images or slices of specific areas of the body are obtained from a large series of two-dimensional X-ray images taken in different directions. These <b>cross-sectional</b> images can be combined into a three-dimensional image of {{the inside of the}} body and used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in various medical disciplines.|$|E
