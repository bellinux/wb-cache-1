5000|$|Greylag geese are herbivorous {{and feed}} chiefly on grasses. Short, {{actively}} growing grass is more nutritious and greylag geese are often found grazing in pastures with sheep or cows. Because of its low nutrient status, {{they need to}} feed for much of their time; the herbage passes rapidly through the gut and is voided frequently. The tubers of sea <b>clubrush</b> (Bolboschoenus maritimus) are also taken as well as berries and water plants such as duckweed (Lemna) and floating sweetgrass (Glyceria fluitans). In wintertime they eat grass and leaves but also glean grain on cereal stubbles and sometimes feed on growing crops, especially during the night. They {{have been known to}} feed on oats, wheat, barley, buckwheat, lentils, peas and root crops. Acorns are sometimes consumed, and on the coast, seagrass (Zostera sp.) may be eaten. In the 1920s in Britain, the pink-footed goose [...] "discovered" [...] that potatoes were edible and started feeding on waste potatoes. The greylag followed suit in the 1940s and now regularly searches for tubers on ploughed fields.|$|E
40|$|The complex task of {{determining}} the inundation requirements of large floodplain wetlands is often simplified {{through the use of}} representative, umbrella or flagship species. This subset of species is targeted {{based on the assumption that}} their collective inundation requirements serve as a surrogate for the broader suite of species found within the wetland. We tested the application of representative species commonly used in wetland and water management planning in the Murray-Darling Basin. In a review of the water requirements of 155 plants and animals, we collated information on preferred inundation timing, duration, depth, rate of rise and fall, and inter-flood period for 115 species. We then used cluster analysis to determine the extent to which ten commonly used representative species corresponded in inundation requirements to the broader suite of species. We found that the habitat surrogates of river red gum, black box, spike rush, coolibah, water couch, lignum and marsh <b>clubrush</b> represented only one third of species at a 60 % level of similarity in inundation requirements, due mainly to the lower inundation return period and duration required by the habitat surrogates. The addition of faunal representative species facilitated the inclusion of a broader range of requirements, though primarily amongst related taxa. We recommend the inclusion of several additional indicator species to more adequately cover the inundation requirem ents of large wetland ecosystems. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} microtopography and edaphic factors to ascertain their use as determinants for identifying {{the location and}} extent of plant community types in internationally important Baltic coastal wetlands in Estonia. Plant community types were identified, and abundance and frequency of plant species were recorded within 105 1 -m 2 quadrats at two sites. Within each quadrat, a real-time kinematic differential GPS (dGPS) was used to record elevation; soil moisture, organic matter, particle size, pH, salinity, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) were also measured. A significant difference was recorded for elevation in six of the seven different plant communities: Reed Swamp, <b>Clubrush</b> Swamp, Lower Shore grassland, Upper Shore grassland, Tall Grassland, and Scrub and Developing Woodland. Median elevation differences between plant communities were between 0. 04 m and 0. 19 m. Soil moisture and salinity were related to elevation, and all three significantly influenced plant community location. A Canonical Correspondence Analysis confirmed that elevation and soil moisture influenced the distribution of {{five of the seven}} community types, while the remaining two communities were strongly related to either pH and salinity or organic matter, N, and K, respectively. Microtopography was found to strongly affect the distribution and extent of Baltic coastal wetland plant communities because of the relationship between sea-level and site hydrology. Rising sea levels may profoundly affect the distribution of plant communities in these wetlands, and the quantification of the elevation differences between the plant communities in this study provides an important baseline for predicting their future location and extent...|$|E
