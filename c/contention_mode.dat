40|$|The Ribosome Flow Model (RFM) {{describes}} the unidirectional movement of interacting particles along a one-dimensional chain of sites. As a site becomes fuller, the effective entry rate into this site decreases. The RFM {{has been used}} to model and analyze mRNA translation, a biological process in which ribosomes (the particles) move along the mRNA molecule (the chain), and decode the genetic information into proteins. Here we propose the RFM as an analytical framework for modeling and analyzing linear communication networks. In this context, the moving particles are data-packets, the chain of sites is a one dimensional set of ordered buffers, and the decreasing entry rate to a fuller buffer represents a kind of decentralized backpressure flow control. For an RFM with homogeneous link capacities, we provide closed-form expressions for important network metrics including the throughput and end-to-end delay.

30|$|The MAC {{layer of}} the 802.11 {{standard}} {{is based on the}} CSMA/CA mechanism [2, 3]. Collision avoidance is achieved through a distributed coordination function (DCF) that specifies the timing rules of accessing the wireless medium. Stations running DCF have to wait for an interframe space (IFS) time before they can access the wireless medium. The IFS is frame-type dependent. An arbitration IFS (AIFS) is used for data frames. The access point (AP) uses a PIFS (point coordination function IFS), which is shorter than AIFS, for management and polling messages; therefore, it can interrupt normal contention and take over the channel to create periods of contention free access called controlled access phase (CAP). As a result, the timeline of a WLAN can be viewed as being always in <b>contention</b> <b>mode,</b> interrupted occasionally by AP controlled CAPs.|$|E

In this paper, we present an accurate analytical model that describes the contention-based bandwidth (BW) request scheme of the 802. 16 standard, which is also known as WiMAX, for the persistent and nonpersistent request generation cases. We first model the contention procedure with a Markov chain, taking into account the exponential back-off procedure as well as the waiting time for a BW assignment and the possible timeout for lost messages. The accuracy of the model is then evaluated by comparing it with simulation results {{for a wide range of}} values of the parameters involved. We use this model to accurately calculate the capacity of the contention slots in delivering BW requests, from which the average access delay is also found. These measures are used to determine a proper configuration for the efficient operation of the contention-based BW request scheme. The proposed model provides a useful analytical tool for devising adaptive configuration mechanisms for the <b>contention</b> access <b>mode</b> of the 802. 16 medium access control (MAC) layer.

The problem has been studied under a common framework which considers both concurrency control issues and the real-time constraints in centralized and distributed transaction processing. A real-time transaction processing model has been defined for a centralized system. The proposed protocols use a unified approach to maximize concurrency while meeting real-time constraints at the same time. In order to test {{the behavior of the}} model and the proposed protocols, a real-time transaction processing testbed has been developed using discrete event simulation techniques. The results indicate that different protocols work better under different load scenarios and that the overall performance can be significantly enhanced by modifying the underlying system configuration. Among other system and transaction parameters, the effect of data partitioning, buffer management, preemption, disk <b>contention,</b> locking <b>mode</b> and multiprocessing has been studied;For the distributed environment, new concepts of real-time nested transactions and priority propagation have been proposed. Real-time nested {{transactions in}}corporate the deadline requirements in the hierarchical structure of nested transactions. Priority propagation addresses the issues related to transaction aborts in real-time nested transaction processing. The notion of priority ceiling has been used to avoid the priority inversion problem. The proposed protocols exhibit freedom from deadlock and have tightly bounded waiting period. Both of these properties make them very suitable for distributed real-time transaction processing environment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Load-balanced {{switches}} {{have received}} {{a great deal of}} attention recently as they are much more scalable than other existing switch architectures in the literature. However, as there exist multiple paths for flows of packets to traverse through loadbalanced switches, packets in such switches may be delivered out of order. In this paper, we propose a new switch architecture, called the CR switch, that not only delivers packets in order but also guarantees 100 % throughput. The key idea, as in a multiple access channel, is to operate the CR switch in two modes: (i) the <b>contention</b> <b>mode</b> in light traffic and (ii) the reservation mode in heavy traffic. To do this, we invent a new buffer management scheme, called I-VOQ (virtual output queue with insertion). With the I-VOQ scheme, we give rigorous mathematical proofs for 100 % throughput and in order packet delivery of the CR switch. By computer simulations, we also demonstrate that the average packet delay of the CR switch is considerably lower than other schemes in the literature, including the uniform frame spreading scheme [8], the padded frame scheme [6] and the mailbox switch [4].

40|$|In recent years, the IEEE 802. 11 WLANs (Wireless Local-Area Networks) have {{received}} significant attention {{due to their}} higher bandwidth than wide-area cellular systems and their use of unlicensed (free-to-use) operational bands. Most 802. 11 -compliant prod-ucts available in the market only implement the mandatory DCF (Distributed Coordina-tion Function) at the MAC (Medium Access Control) layer, {{and because of the}} inher-ent design flaws of the DCF protocol, the current 802. 11 systems present poor fairness-performance/energy-efficiency/channel-utilization.

The method then applies Automatic Differentiation (AD) to these implicit performance models, to compute sensitivities of various performance metrics with respect to network parameters. We demonstrate the method by applying it to time varying mobile network topologies, including reduced connectivity instances, with both random access MAC (<b>contention</b> <b>mode</b> of the 802. 11) as well as reservation based MAC (USAP TDMA based protocol).

Phelps noted that he had recently been experimenting with a coal tar derivative called orthotolidine which he said could be used to show that chlorine itself was present in water and he claimed that chlorine was responsible for the disinfection of pathogens. The orthotolidine method for chorine residual was modified many times over the next several decades but Phelps’s testimony about it was the first mention of it in any document. The method was used for many years as the standard way of determining chlorine residuals in water. In the 1970s and 1980s it was eventually replaced by the DPD method. Orthotolidine is still used in test kits to determine chlorine levels in swimming pools.|$|R

This {{is because}} each node can process any transaction, query or subquery {{because it has}} access to the entire database. Compared to Shared Nothing database systems, this is particularly advantageous for scan queries for which the degree of intra-query parallelism as well as the scan processors themselves can dynamically be chosen. On the other hand, there is the danger of disk contention between subqueries, in particular for index scans. We present a detailed simulation study to analyze the effectiveness of parallel scan processing in Shared Disk database systems. In particular, we investigate the relationship between the degree of declustering and the degree of scan parallelism for relation scans, clustered index scans, and non-clustered index scans. Furthermore, we study the usefulness of disk caches and prefetching for limiting disk contention. Finally, we show that disk <b>contention</b> in multi-user <b>mode</b> can be limited for Shared Disk database systems by dynamically choosing the degree of scan parallelism...|$|R

However, <b>mode</b> transitions inherent in bimodal locking have not yet been fully considered. The algorithm requires busy-wait in the transition from the light mode (in ation), and does not make the reverse transition (deation) at all.

We also present statistics on the synchronization behavior of real multithreaded Java programs, which indicate that busy-wait in in ation and absence of de ation can be problematic in terms of robustness and performance.

The successful transmission of data over the power lines will make the BPL technology a cost-effective solution for the so-called “last miles” in communication networks [1]. Recently, this effort received a significant boost by {{the approval of the}} IEEE P 1901 standard [20]. This standard specifies the regulations for the operation of the Physical and MAC layers of the BPL network. It proposes two major MAC protocols – Time Division Multiplexing Access (TDMA) for the contention-free access and Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) for the contention access. In this thesis, we present the performance models of the contention-free access and the contention access mechanisms. For the contention-free transmission mode, we determine analytically the probability distribution of the number of beacon periods that it takes to transmit a MAC frame over multi-hop communications subject to transmission errors, then, we developed an analysis that determines the network capacity, the number of users that the system may support. Also, we determine the MAC efficiency of the network when it’s operating under both contention-free and <b>contention</b> <b>mode.</b> These results may be helpful in the design of BPL networks...|$|E
40|$|Wireless {{networks}} enter {{a new era}} {{in which}} various objects, such as mobile phones, computers, vehicles, watches, are automatically and intelligently connected to provide ubiquitous services. Green communication protocols are required to save energy consumption and improve transmission performance. MAC protocols can detect the signal status and energy consumptions of physical channels to adapt to the dynamic wireless conditions. They can also provide node-to-node transmissions for network layer protocols under green wireless networks. The thesis presents three energy efficient communication solutions under different delay-tolerant networks scenarios to study the efficiency of MAC transmission protocols within wireless networks: CPMAC, AFLAS and TREE. CPMAC applies three energy-aware algorithms to transmit different quality requirements of data within one contact interval in sparsely connected sensor networks. Simulations and analysis shows CPMAC outperforms two other important MAC protocols in wireless sensor networks and vehicular ad-hoc networks in throughput, delay, energy consumption. AFLAS uses an adaptive frame length aggregation scheme for Vehicular Networks that is designed to improve transmission efficiency and increase data throughput. Suitable aggregation frame lengths are calculated according to the current wireless status, and applied in the MAC layer at the onset of data transmissions to save overhead and energy consumption. The simulations of AFLAS exhibit a significant improvement results in data throughput, retransmissions, overheads and transmission efficiency in comparison to non-adaptive aggregation schemes. TRaffic adaptive Energy Efficient MAC protocol (TREE) adapts its work modes: reservation and <b>contention</b> <b>mode,</b> to traffic density and adjusts its duty cycle to achieve energy efficiency. TREE demonstrates better performance in terms of energy efficiency and traffic adaptability than the schedule-based MAC protocol TDMA, the contention-based protocol CSMA and the traffic adaptive protocol TRAMA under mobile sensor network environments.

40|$|In recent years, {{wireless}} communication systems have become pervasive, allowing continuous connectivity for {{people on the}} move, {{at home and in}} the workplace. The advent of third generation (3 G) systems with capabilities beyond traditional telephony, and the explosive uptake of wireless Local Area Networks (LANs) are but two factors that have contributed to this growth. By virtue of their appeal to the market, wireless LANs have proven to be a serious contender as the access technology of choice for traditional data as well as the emerging 3 G networks. If wireless LANs are to be successful as an access technology, however, the issue of Quality of Service (QoS) support will need to be addressed. QoS support for wireless LANs is becoming increasingly important because applications requiring such support, e. g. voice and video, are becoming more common in today's hybrid wireless systems, with the trend expected to grow into the future. The dominant standard for wireless LANs is the IEEE's 802. 11 of which the contention-based Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol; also known as the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF), is universally supported. While the DCF is widely supported, it provides no QoS support. In this work, we propose and study a new and different mechanism of achieving service differentiation in 802. 11 wireless LANs. Our approach employs the capture effect as the vehicle for achieving QoS differentiation for the <b>contention</b> <b>mode</b> of the standard. This approach enriches current research efforts by providing another dimension to QoS provisioning in wireless LANs. Hitherto most proposals have focussed on the modification of some aspect of the protocol, such as the minimum contention window size (CWmin), the Distributed Inter-Frame Space (DIFS), or the maximum contention window size (CWmax), amongst others. Capture based service differentiation complements these efforts. It can be used alone or in conjunction with existing approaches to provide additional priority classes. In this thesis, the capture based service differentiation approach is proposed and studied through Markov chain modelling and simulation. From the study, the following conclusions were drawn. It was confirmed that capture based service differentiation is a feasible approach in wireless LANs and that it can be achieved with practical and sustainable power differences between the transmitters from different classes. A number of factors were found to influence the level of service differentiation, including the population ratios of hosts in the power classes, the power ratios of the transmitters as well as the capture threshold of the receiver. For practical considerations, a complete architectural framework is also proposed, including support functions such as Transmission Power Control (TPC), QoS Signalling and Admission Control...|$|E

The proposed architecture, HPAM, is organized as a Hierarchy of Processor-And-Memory homogeneous subsystems. Across the levels of the hierarchy, processor speeds and interconnection technology vary. The proposed multilevel processor configuration uses fast and costly resources sparingly to reduce sequential and low parallelism bottlenecks. The resulting organization tries to balance cost, speed and parallelism granularity. ^ Two temporal (instruction and data) locality principles {{with respect to the}} degree of parallelism are identified and empirically established for a set of programs. These principles suggest the desirability of a hierarchical approach to cost-effective high-performance computing. ^ In order to conduct detailed analysis of the different features of HPAM machines, a simulator was developed. This simulator (HPAM-Sim) allows the simulation of target machines consisting of different processors and interconnection networks in either <b>contention</b> or non-contention <b>modes.</b> ^ Using HPAM-Sim, a simulation-based study of the performance achieved by mapping compiler and hand-parallelized versions of the CMU benchmarks onto different HPAM machines was conducted. This study establishes that (1) HPAM machines can have higher cost-efficiency than the optimal homogeneous machine for a given application; (2) HPAM machines can benefit from hardware and software support for reconfiguring three-level and two-level machines into two-level and one-level organizations; (3) the performance of a given application, when executed on an HPAM machine, is dictated not only by the degree of parallelism but also the ratio of total communication time to total computation time of the application; and (4) efficient implementations of collective communication operations can improve the performance of HPAM machines. This last fact led to the study of three important collective communication operations, namely broadcast, scatter and gather, {{in the context of an}} HPAM machine. ...|$|R
