The vascular structures of the conjunctiva and episclera are rich with specific details that are useful in identifying individuals. Unlike retinal scans, the vascular structures of the conjunctiva and episclera provide extensive and unique {{information that can be}} obtained from various and selected regions of the eye and processed to authenticate or identify individuals. The technology can work with less light, on non-compliant targets, and from much greater distances than currently employed methods. It can function as a stand-alone biometric or could be used in conjunction with exiting ocular-based biometrics to achieve enhanced performance and spoof-proofing.

40|$|Introduction. Keratocnjunctivitis is corneal and conjunctival {{inflammation}} Clinical signs {{involve the}} irritating trio: mixed hyperemia of <b>conjunctival</b> <b>membranes,</b> corneal subepthelial infiltrates and regional lymphadenopathy. The most common causes of epidemic are adenovirus, herpes virus, and rarely cytomegalovirus, {{which are now}} occurring with higher frequency as secondary infections. Objective. The aim {{of the study was}} to present and analyze keratoconjunctival epidemics in the region of Kragujevac from September 2008 to February 2009, as well as to analyze clinical features related to virusological findings and etiology. Methods. In 329 patients we performed clinical examination (biomicroscopy, fluorescent test, corneal sensitivity test), collecting standard specimen of the conjuctiva and cornea, made serological examination, and sent the specimens to the Virusology Institute “Torlak” in Belgrade for the confirmation of epidemic etiology. The patients were treated with local and symptomatological therapy. The epidemic was eradicated in cooperation with a regional referent institution. All outpatients activities were ceased, while hospital hygienic, sanitary, intra-, extra-hospital and therapeutic procedures were undertaken. Results. The distribution of 329 patients by gender was equivalent. Most patients were aged from 27 to 34 years (25 %) of working population. The distribution of patients by clinical features showed the predominance of follicular hyperplasy (93. 62 %). The distribution according to the time of the first symptoms onset showed the frequency of 50 % of corneal infiltrate in the second week. The period elapsed from the diagnosis to cure was three weeks in 50 % of patients. Serological tests confirmed the mixed distribution of the cause. Conclusion. Based on the authors’ experience, in order to eradicate epidemics as fast as possible and achieve efficient treatment, it is recommended that the epidemic should be reported, guidelines of referent institutions be obeyed, all of which diminishes the recognizable professional risk and decreases mistakes...|$|R

40|$|African animal {{trypanosomosis}} (AAT) {{is considered}} the most important cattle disease in sub-Saharan Africa but its diagnosis {{in the field is}} difficult, resulting in inappropriate treatments, excessive delay in treatments and under-treatment. A field study in West Africa investigated the usefulness of anemia in the diagnosis of trypanosomosis. A total of 20, 772 cattle blood samples were taken from 121 villages in 3 countries. The average packed cell volume (PCV) of trypanosomosis positive cattle was 23 %, versus 28 % for negative cattle. In a sub-set of animals, other causes of anemia were investigated showing most of the anemia burden was attributable to trypanosomosis. Anemia was a reasonably accurate indicator of trypanosomosis in the study area, with a sensitivity of 56 % and a specificity of 80 % and a diagnostic odds ratio of 4. 2, the highest of all the signs evaluated (anemia, emaciation, staring coat, lymphadenopathy, fever, lacrimation and salivary or nasal discharge). Having confirmed the usefulness of anemia as a predictor of trypanosomosis, two potential pen-side tests for anemia were evaluated (the first reported trial of their use in cattle), firstly a color chart developed for anemia detection in sheep through visual inspection of <b>conjunctival</b> <b>membranes</b> (FAMACHA©) and secondly the Hemoglobin Color Scale (HbCS) developed for assessing hemoglobin levels in human patients by comparing blood drops on filter paper with color standards. In a population of cattle suspected by their owners to be sick with trypanosomosis (n = 898) the sensitivity of the HbCS test was 56 % and the specificity was 77 %, while the sensitivity of the FAMACHA© test was 95 % and the specificity was 22 %. The higher sensitivity but lower specificity suggests the FAMACHA© may be useful as a screening test and the HbCS as a confirmatory test. The two tests were also evaluated in cattle randomly selected from the village herd. Using cut-off points to optimize test performance, the HbCS test had a sensitivity of 81 % and a specificity of 62 % (n = 505 cattle), while the FAMACHA© had a sensitivity of 92 % and a specificity of 30 % (n = 298 cattle).

40|$|PURPOSE: Ocular mucous {{membrane}} pemphigoid (OMMP) is an autoimmune disease involving {{the eye and}} characterized by subepithelial detachment resulting from an immunologic reaction against <b>conjunctival</b> basal <b>membrane</b> zone (BMZ) antigens. Lyell syndrome (LS) is a drug-induced, T cell-mediated, cytotoxic reaction involving the mucocutaneous areas. Two patients with LS are presented in whom OMMP developed. DESIGN: Report of 2 cases. PARTICIPANTS: Two male patients, 80 and 60 years old, with persistent corneal ulcerations, corneal melting, and inflammation some months after an LS episode. METHODS: Conjunctival biopsy samples were obtained to perform direct immunofluorescence (DIF) and histologic analyses. Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) also were performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Immunodeposit findings on the conjunctival BMZ obtained by DIF and IIF, inflammatory infiltration of the corneoconjunctival samples studied by histologic analysis, and autoantibodies of patient sera directed against BMZ antigens tested by ELISA. RESULTS: Direct immunofluorescence analyses showed immunoglobulin G and complement 3 component deposits along the BMZ in a linear pattern. Histologic analysis revealed the presence of eosinophils, neutrophils, and mast cells with fibrin deposition in the substantia propria of both patients; the data confirmed the clinical suspicion of OMMP. The IIF and ELISA results were negative. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic eye surface injury associated with LS may promote autoimmunization against ocular epithelial BMZ antigens, playing a strategic role in the subsequent onset of OMMP. The occurrence of OMMP after LS could be an occasional finding, or conversely, LS could be an underestimated predisposing factor {{in the development of}} OMMP...|$|R

Methods: Seventy-six subjects were recruited for this study: 25 SS (confirmed via American-European Consensus Criteria 2002), 25 KCS (confirmed by symptoms and Schirmer scores ≤ 10 mm) and 26 NDE. Tear flow {{was measured by the}} Schirmer test without anesthesia for 5 min. Tears were collected using an eye-wash technique.

Soluble and membrane bound MUC 16 were quantified via western blotting and MUC 16 mRNA was quantified by real time qPCR. Results: The SS group demonstrated significantly higher concentrations of soluble MUC 16 (7. 28 [SS]± 3. 97 versus 3. 35 [KCS]± 4. 54 [p= 0. 004] and versus 1. 61 [NDE]± 1. 22 [p< 0. 001]) and MUC 16 mRNA (4. 66 [SS]± 5. 06 versus 1. 84 [KCS] ± 2. 26 [p= 0. 01] and 1. 52 [NDE]± 1. 04 [p= 0. 003]) compared to both KCS and NDE groups, respectively.

Liquid chromatography coupled to nano-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry was subsequently used to identify four Ad 37 receptor candidates: CD 46, CD 87, CD 98, and CD 147. Immunodepletion analyses demonstrated that the 50 -kDa protein is identical to CD 46 (also known as membrane cofactor protein). The Ad 37, but not Ad 5, fiber knob bound to the extracellular domain of CD 46, demonstrating a direct interaction of an Ad 37 capsid protein with CD 46. An antibody specific for the N-terminal 19 amino acids of CD 46 also blocked Ad 37 infection of human cervical carcinoma and conjunctival cells, indicating a requirement for CD 46 in infection. Finally, expression of a 50 -kDa isoform of human CD 46 in a CD 46 -null cell line increased cell binding by wild-type Ad 37 and gene delivery by an Ad vector pseudotyped with the Ad 37 fiber, but not by a vector bearing the Ad 5 fiber.

40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{substrate}} that supports epithelial migration in vivo is of interest, {{particularly with respect to}} mechanisms of wound healing. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were used to search for common substrate components in prototype rabbit corneal wounds: epithelial scrape wounds, in which the corneal or conjunctival epithelium migrated over the denuded lamina densa of the corneal basement membrane (CBM), and superficial keratectomy, in which the corneal epithelium migrated over a bare stroma without CBM. The corneal epithelium moved rapidly over the CBM or stroma to cover the defect within 2 - 3 d, whereas the conjunctival epithelium required 1 - 2 wk. In all wounds, fibronectin and fibrin/fibrinogen were deposited onto the bare surface within 8 h after wounding and persisted under the migrating epithelium until migration was complete. Bullous pemphigoid antigen (BPA), a normal component of the CBM, was removed with the epithelium upon scrape wounding and reappeared in the CBM after migration was completed. In contrast, the conjunctival epithelium had a continuous subepithelial band of BPA out to the migrating tip. Laminin, also a normal component of the CBM, was not removed in the scrape wounds, indicating that the region of least resistance to shear stress was between the BPA and laminin layers. Laminin was removed by superficial keratectomy and was not detectable under {{the leading edge of the}} migrating cells. Laminin and BPA were restored in the CBM by 2 - 4 wk. Type IV collagen could not be detected in normal CBM, but was conspicuously present in <b>conjunctival</b> basement <b>membrane</b> and in blood vessels. Focal bands of type IV collagen did appear in the newly synthesized CBM 2 - 4 wk after keratectomy. These results argue that BPA, laminin, and type IV collagen are not essential for the migration of corneal epithelium during wound healing and support the hypothesis that fibronectin and fibrin/fibrinogen are the common, perhaps the essential, components of the provisional matrix that serves as a substrate until the permanent attachment components are regenerated...|$|R

The vesicles were obtained by sonication of equimolar mixtures (either 75 or 15 mM) of polysorbate 20 and cholesterol. Non-ionic surfactant vesicle vehicles containing cyclopentolate (0. 5 or 1. 0 % w/v) and buffered at two pH values (7. 4 and 5. 5) as well as appropriate reference solutions were tested for cyclopentolate permeation through rabbit corneas in vitro, and for mydriatic activity in rabbits. In the in vitro study, the pH 5. 5 non-ionic surfactant vesicle formations (independent of the molar concentration of components) promoted transcorneal permeation of cyclopentolate {{with respect to a}} reference buffer solution, while the opposite effect was observed at pH 7. 4. In the pharmacodynamic study, the non-ionic surfactant vesicle formulations, independent of their pH, significantly improved the ocular bioavailability of cyclopentolate, both with respect to reference micellar solutions (i. e., solutions containing only polysorbate 20) and to reference buffer solutions. The contrasting results observed in vitro and in vivo, together with the observed low encapsulation capacity for cyclopentolate of the vesicle formulations, led the authors to formulate the provisional hypothesis that non-ionic surfactant vesicles may promote absorption of cyclopentolate by preferentially modifying the permeability characteristics of the <b>conjunctival</b> and scleral <b>membranes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Gelareh S Noureddin, Sonia N Yeung Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada Abstract: Pterygium is a fibrovascular {{growth of}} the bulbar {{conjunctiva}} that crosses the limbus and extends over the peripheral cornea, in some cases resulting in significant visual morbidity. When treatment is indicated, surgery is necessary, and several management options exist. These include excision, conjunctival autografting, {{and the use of}} adjuvant therapies. This paper reviews the incidence and prevalence of pterygia and also describes the various techniques currently used to treat this condition. These management options are compared to the use of dry amniotic membrane grafting (AMG), specifically with regard to recurrence rates, time to recurrence, safety and tolerability, as well as patient factors including cosmesis and quality of life. AMG has been used in the treatment of ocular surface disease due to a variety of benefits, including its anti-inflammatory properties, as well as its ability to promote epithelial growth and suppress transforming growth factor-β signaling and fibroblast proliferation. However, rates of recurrence for AMG following pterygium excision still surpass other commonly used techniques, including conjunctival and limbal autografting. Nevertheless, there are circumstances in which AMG may be most beneficial to the patient, such as when preexisting conjunctival scarring is present, when the conjunctiva must be spared for future glaucoma filtering surgery, or in cases of large or double-headed pterygia. Therefore, surgeons should be prepared to offer this procedure as an option to their patients for the treatment of pterygia.

Topical ocular corticosteroids {{are commonly used}} {{in the treatment of}} anterior segment diseases and inflammation associated with ocular surgery, and manufacturers continually strive to improve their characteristics. We describe the development of a novel ophthalmic gel formulation of loteprednol etabonate (LE), a C- 20 ester-based corticosteroid with an established safety profile, in the treatment of ocular inflammatory conditions. The new LE gel formulation is non-settling, eliminating the need to shake the product to resuspend the drug, has a pH close to that of tears, and a low preservative concentration. The rheological characteristics of LE gel are such that the formulation is instilled as a drop and transitions to a fluid upon instillation in the eye, yet retains sufficient viscosity to prolong ocular surface retention. The new formulation provides consistent, uniform dosing as evidenced by dose extrusion studies, while pharmacokinetic studies in rabbits demonstrated rapid and sustained exposure to LE in ocular tissues following instillation of LE gel. Finally, results from two clinical studies of LE gel in the treatment of postoperative inflammation and pain following cataract surgery indicate that it was safe and effective.

Main outcome measures: Parameters of LSCD, including vascularization, conjunctivalization, inflammation, epithelial defect, photophobia, and pain. Results: The mean follow-up period was 28 months (range, 12 – 50). Seven of 10 eyes (70 %) had improved parameters of LSCD at final follow-up and were considered successes. Four (40 %) had improved visual acuity, including 3 having had further procedures for visual rehabilitation. Three patients failed to improve— 1 with a thermal burn and lid deformity, 1 with Stevens–Johnson syndrome and severe dry eye, and 1 with ectodermal dysplasia who developed an epithelial defect at 26 months. DNA analysis of the first 7 cases showed no ex vivo donor stem cell DNA present beyond 9 months. Conclusions: Ex vivo expanded stem cell allograft is a useful technique for restoring the ocular surface in profound LSCD. The absence of donor DNA beyond 9 months suggests that ongoing immunosuppression may be unnecessary and raises questions regarding the origin of the host corneal epithelium...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. (Homoeopathy) Allergic Rhinitis (AR) is the {{inflammation}} of the nasal and often <b>conjunctival</b> mucous <b>membrane.</b> It manifests due to the exposure of inhaled allergic agents and results in an immunoglobulin E (lgE) mediated reaction (DiPiro et al., 2002; Shargel et al., 2001). Allergic rhinitis is characterised by four principle symptoms, watery rhinorrhoea, nasal obstruction, nasal itching and sneezing (Min, 2010). In addition to the cardinal symptoms experienced during AR other common symptoms include postnasal drip, pruritic eyes; ears; nose and palate (Kemp, 2009). Although allergic rhinitis is not life threatening, the adverse impact on {{quality of life is}} significant. Those affected by allergic rhinitis are restricted in their ability to carry out their normal daily activities (Nelson, 2007; Wilson et al., 2002). Sleep, social interaction, emotional well being as well as cognitive and psychomotor function are affected by allergic rhinitis, and can lead to impaired learning ability. Serious disorders such as eczema, asthma, sinusitis, otitis media, nasal polyposis, respiratory infections and orthodontic malocclusions are. frequently linked with allergic rhinitis (DiPiro et al., 2002; Kemp, 2009)., The therapeutic goal for patients suffering with allergic rhinitis is to prevent or minimise symptoms, using treatment with minimal or no side effects and of reasonable expense, so that patients may maintain a normal lifestyle (DiPiro et aI., 2002). One of the most frequent indications for which homoeopathic treatment is sought after is for respiratory allergies (Ramchandani, 2009). Thus it has been proposed that the remedies contained within Otirin Nasal Spray"; namely Allium cepa, Euphrasia officinalis, Luffa operculata and Sabadilla officinarummay be effective as a treatment for allergic rhinitis (Vermeulen, 2000). Otirin Nasal Spray" is a homoeopathic complex preparation indicated for allergic rhinitis. No specific research has been conducted on this product to determine its efficacy in this condition (Medford, 2008). The aim of this research {{study was to determine the}} efficacy of Otirin Nasal Spray" in the treatment of allergic rhinitis with regard to the severity Of symptoms; specifically on the symptoms relating to the nose, eyes, throat, mouth and ears. Diary cards and questionnaires were completed, making use of the severity of symptoms scores to grade the symptoms. This research study was a quantitative" double-blind, placebo-controlled study and included thirty participants suffering from AR. Participants volunteered to participate in the study, were over the age of eighteen and consented to the procedures of the research study. Participants involved in the study were randomly divided into a treatment (experimental) group and a control (placebo) group. The treatment group received the Otirin Nasal Spray'" as opposed to the control group who received the placebo nasal spray (saline nasal spray). The research study was conducted over a period of four weeks at the UJ Health Centre. Participants were instructed to complete an individual "Treatment Diary Card" (Appendix E) during each hayfever attack by scoring the severity of each symptom they suffered from. During the final consultation the "Response to Treatment Questionnaire" (Appendix F) was completed under the researcher's supervision. This questionnaire required participants to score an amelioration, aggravation, no change or not applicable for each symptom, as well as other associated symptoms. Results acquired from the research study were statistically analysed by Statkon at the University of Johannesburg by means of descriptive statistics, parametric and non-parametric tests. The parametric test included the Independent Samples TTest. Non-parametric tests included the Friedman Test, Wilcoxon Signed Rank, and Mann-Whitney U Test. This research study determined that the homoeopathically prepared Otirin Nasal Spray" did have a statistically significant effect in the treatment of allergic rhinitis symptoms. A trend towards a decrease in the severity of the participant's symptoms was observed, in particular for rhinorrhoea, sneezing, nasal blockage/congestion, pruritic/itchy eyes and postnasal drip...|$|R
40|$|Microbial keratitis, a sight-destroying {{disease that}} affects wearers of contact lenses, {{is caused by}} {{microbes}} in the cornea. To succeed in causing disease, the microbe (e. g. bacteria, fungus or virus) must adhere to, penetrate, and traverse the corneal epithelium and enter the stroma. Once they are inside the stroma, the inflammatory response caused by infiltrating erythrocytes, proteins, and fluid results in opacity of the cornea. (Niederkorn, Kaplan et al. 2007) The most common strategy for researching microbial keratitis is to inject bacteria under the epithelium or to scratch the epithelium down to the stroma before application of the bacteria, because the epithelium has barrier functions that prevent both bacterial adhesion and penetration of the cornea. Therefore, {{the role of the}} corneal epithelium in this disease has been understudied. Further study of the epithelium is important to find out how bacteria attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in our protective barriers, and even more so to identify the critical barriers providing the protection we need to stay healthy and free from disease. My research focuses on the initial stages of infection and how the bacteria cross the corneal epithelial barrier to begin the process. To that end, I have been studying two virulence systems of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, namely the Type II and Type III secretion systems, which are known to be involved in corneal infections (Hobden 2002, Coburn, Sekirov et al. 2007). The Type II secretion system (T 2 SS) is an extracellular system that secretes several proteases (including LasA, LasB and AprA) and other virulence factors outside the bacteria to interact with the surface of the host cell. The Type III secretion system (T 3 SS) is an injection system that uses a needle apparatus to inject virulence factors directly into the host cell. Previous research has shown that a knockout of the entire T 3 SS stops traversal completely, but which virulence factor is responsible has not yet been identified. Both systems {{have been shown to be}} important in bacterial virulence and are associated with severe disease. It is suspected that these systems help penetrate and traverse the corneal epithelium, which is the initial stage in microbial keratitis not caused by deep injury. My first finding reported in this study is that LasB from the T 2 SS is the protease involved in bacterial traversal of the corneal epithelium. Knockout bacteria lacking the LasB protease are unable to traverse the corneal epithelium to the basal lamina, whereas, in a rescue experiment in which LasB encoded on a plasmid is reintroduced to bacteria lacking LasA and LasB, the bacteria regain the ability to traverse. Though the T 3 SS is important, the role of individual secreted factors in this system remains unclear. I have used knockout bacteria for all of the secreted effectors (ExoS, ExoT, ExoU, and ExoY) but still observe epithelial disruption and bacterial traversal to the stroma. Further knockouts of the translocon (PopB, PopD) also failed to prevent this outcome. Only knockouts of the T 3 SS structural proteins pertaining to the needle (PscC and PscD) or to the entire secretion system (ExsA, the master regulator) were able to prevent this process. Therefore, we cannot establish whether any secreted factor is involved in this process, but it is possible that a fourth previously unknown effector is involved, or that the T 3 SS structural proteins are involved in virulence. I addressed quantification of the relative position of 1 µm bacteria within the corneal epithelium in order to quantify bacterial positions and epithelial damage. By means of 3 D modeling of confocal microscopy images taken at increasing depths through an eye, the apical surface was reconstructed in Bitplane Imaris software. Then, using a distance transform algorithm in MatLab that I developed, both the distance of individual bacteria from the basement membrane and the epithelial thickness were measured. This allowed quantification and statistical analysis of damage to the layers of the cornea, which offers an advantage over qualitative analysis of images using pathology scoring in terms of both accuracy of object identification and flexibility of application. Pathology scores are subjective with very few criteria by which to score results; therefore, small changes are difficult to quantify in this subjective method of analysis. Using 3 D reconstruction methods and advanced distance measurement algorithms, we are able to accurately describe any 3 D situation in a variety of ways to suit the data. These methods can also be automated, eliminating the subjective variability provided by observational assessments and allowing both higher throughput of data analysis and replication by multiple users. Several null infection models are discussed in this study. A null infection model is a model where the normal outcome is no disease; the initial stages of disease can be studied through interactions with these models. In addition to evaluating current null infection methods, I discovered a new approach by exposing the corneal surface to 5 % FBS. (Fetal Bovine Serum, a common growth medium derived from fetal bovine blood serum) However, the null infection models differed with regard to which bacterial factors were needed for epithelial barrier disruption and bacterial traversal. These differences point to different susceptibilities caused by the models, which may relate to the barriers of infection. Thus, virulence factors used by P. aeruginosa to traverse the corneal epithelium depend upon how host defenses are compromised. I also used models to investigate whether or not a stable microbiome exists on the ocular surface and therefore possibly contributes to protecting the eye, as has been found with microbiomes in other areas of the body. Microbiome analysis uses DNA evidence to identify microbes in a very sensitive assay not dependent on culture techniques that may be unable to grow bacteria with special needs. Our initial analysis of interactions between bacteria found in microbiome analysis and the ocular surface indicate that it is very difficult for bacteria to survive on the ocular surface or within the <b>conjunctival</b> mucosal <b>membrane</b> of the eye, and that this is true for both gram-positive and gram-negative ocular pathogens. Staining experiments, designed to enable a live look at bacteria in the eye, were promising in their ability to stain bacteria but, unfortunately, stained epithelial tissue as well. Human subjects whose ocular washes were collected to grow in multiple nonstandard conditions were equally unable to produce results, indicating that the bacteria implicated in microbiome DNA analysis, some culturable even under standard conditions, may not be actually present– at least not in a live form. There still might be a stable microbiome on the ocular surface that I was unable to find, but current results suggest that this possibility is remote. Further investigation with a murine model is currently underway to determine whether the use of DNA evidence to identify living colonies of microbes can be achieved. Taken together, the research presented in this dissertation advances our understanding of how the ocular surface remains healthy despite exposure to the barrage of potentially pathogenic microbes that exist in our environment. The data continue to support the notion that the healthy ocular surface harbors only transient microbes due to its capacity to rapidly clear even large inocula. They also show that when corneal surface defenses are compromised severely enough to allow bacteria to traverse the epithelial barrier, multiple virulence bacteria factors can contribute, with the details depending on the nature of the corneal compromise and the state of the bacteria. While implicating specific host and bacterial factors, these findings also highlight the importance of mimicking conditions allowing health or susceptibility in animal models, and the need to monitor variability among bacterial isolates from different sources, even for the same strain...|$|R
