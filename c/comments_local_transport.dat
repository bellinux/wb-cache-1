40|$|To {{distinguish}} between the beta effect and configuration effect due to an increment in beta on the gradual degradation of the global confinement property in high-beta plasmas on the Large Helical Device (LHD), the <b>local</b> <b>transport</b> characteristics in the high-beta plasmas are studied by considering {{the change in the}} major radius of the magnetic flux surface with the beta value. First, the influence of the change in the magnetic configuration on the <b>local</b> <b>transport</b> is studied in low-beta plasmas, and it is confirmed that the dependence of the <b>local</b> <b>transport</b> properties on the magnetic configuration is almost the same as that proposed in the ISS 04 scaling in the entire plasma region. Next, the dependence of the <b>local</b> <b>transport</b> characteristics in high-beta plasmas on the major radial position of a geometric center of the magnetic flux surface is studied in comparison with that in low-beta plasmas. The dependence of the <b>local</b> <b>transport</b> in the peripheral region is correlated more with beta itself than the magnetic configuration effect, whereas the core transport appears to be correlated more with the configuration effect...|$|R

In Sweden, the company policy is to purchase road <b>transport</b> services from <b>local</b> <b>transport</b> providers, thus not owning any vehicles on their own. Hence, the payment method associated with the <b>local</b> <b>transports</b> and its influence on DHL’s cost structure will be analyzed. Further, DHL’s possibilities of affecting its cost structure deriving from the payment method will be examined, {{as well as how}} the customer is affected by the method in the long run...|$|R
