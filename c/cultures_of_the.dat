Please click on the alternative location to access it. 167 p. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this case study was to qualitatively examine how culture influenced faculty members' perception toward <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> e-learning in a university in Thailand. There were twenty-five faculty {{participants in this study}} who were purposefully selected from different disciplines. Four of twenty-five participants occupy <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> administrator and trainer in addition to their teaching responsibilities. <b>The</b> conceptual framework <b>of</b> this study follows Lechuga's faculty <b>culture,</b> which consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual, <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> academic discipline, <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> academic profession, <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> institution, and <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation. Data sources included semi-structured interviews, documents, and observations. Data was analyzed using Lechuga's faculty culture framework. The key factor that emerges in <b>the</b> areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual and <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> academic discipline is the faculty's familiarity with personal and instructional technologies.

As a result, there were more negative perceptions toward <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> e-learning. Finally, <b>the</b> findings suggest that unclear objectives and future directions of e-learning policies affect faculty members' decision to continue participating in <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> e-learning. <b>The</b> findings identified implications for improving technological preparation, e. g., ongoing and thorough training programs, and support, e. g., revision of e-learning policies, computer equipment, network, and technical and expert support within an institution...|$|R

5|$|Although civilizations in Central America {{attained}} {{a relatively high}} level of sophistication by the eleventh century AD, they lagged behind other civilizations {{in the development of}} musical instruments. For example, they had no stringed instruments; all of their instruments were idiophones, drums, and wind instruments such as flutes and trumpets. Of these, only the flute was capable of producing a melody. In contrast, pre-Columbian South American civilizations in areas such as modern-day Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Chile were less advanced culturally but more advanced musically. South American <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time used pan-pipes as well as varieties of flutes, idiophones, drums, and shell or wood trumpets.|$|E
5|$|As a countermeasure, <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{nematode}} Deladenus siricidicola {{have been}} used as biological control to protect trees since the 1980s. This parasite feeds on the mycelia of A.areolatum and is therefore a food competitor of wood wasp larvae. Where S.noctilio larvae are present, the parasite infects and sterilizes the eggs of female wasps, causing them to be infertile. These infertile females lay infected eggs into new trees and thus spread the nematode. This control method has proven to be relatively successful to combat the Sirex–Amylostereum complex. In the Southern Hemisphere, where the technique has been widely employed, reductions of parasitism levels of 70%–100% have been achieved.|$|E

5|$|Scotland in the High Middle Ages is a {{relatively}} well-studied topic and Scottish medievalists have produced {{a wide variety of}} publications. Some, such as David Dumville, Thomas Owen Clancy and Dauvit Broun, are primarily interested in the native <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country, and often have linguistic training in the Celtic languages. Normanists, such as G.W.S. Barrow, are concerned with the Norman and Scoto-Norman cultures introduced to Scotland after the eleventh century. For much of the twentieth century, historians tended to stress the cultural change that took place in Scotland during this time. However, scholars such as Cynthia Neville and Richard Oram, while not ignoring cultural changes, argue that continuity with the Gaelic past was just as, if not more, important.|$|E
5|$|Sitti Nurbaya: Kasih Tak Sampai (Sitti Nurbaya: Unrealized Love, often {{abbreviated}} Sitti Nurbaya or Siti Nurbaya; original spelling Sitti Noerbaja) is an Indonesian {{novel by}} Marah Rusli.

5|$|Taiwanese aborigines are Austronesian peoples, with {{linguistic}} and genetic ties to other Austronesian ethnic groups, such as {{peoples of the}} Philippines, Malaysia, Madagascar and Oceania.

The Mycenaean civilization was in general more advanced compared to the Late Bronze Age <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest of Europe. Several Mycenaean attributes and achievements were borrowed or held in high regard in later periods; so, it would be no exaggeration to consider Mycenaean Greece as a cradle of civilization.|$|E

5|$|Most pre-Columbian <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Americas {{developed}} and flourished for centuries under monarchical systems of government. By the time Europeans {{arrived on the}} continents in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, however, many of these civilizations had ceased to function, due to various natural and artificial causes. Those that remained up to that period were eventually defeated by the agents of European monarchical powers, who, while they remained on the European continent, thereafter established new American administrations overseen by delegated viceroys. Some of these colonies were, in turn, replaced by either republican states or locally founded monarchies, ultimately overtaking the entire American holdings of some European monarchs; those crowns that once held or claim territory in the Americas include the Spanish, Portuguese, French, Swedish, and Russian, and even Baltic Courland, Holy Roman, Prussian and Norwegian. Certain of the locally established monarchies were themselves also overthrown through revolution, leaving five current pretenders to American thrones.|$|E
5|$|The Apologetic Summary History of the People of These Indies (Spanish Apologética historia summaria de las gentes destas Indias) {{was first}} written as the 68th {{chapter of the}} General History of the Indies, but Las Casas changed it into a volume of its own, {{recognizing}} that the material was not historical. The material contained in the Apologetic History is primarily ethnographic accounts of the indigenous <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indies – the Taíno, the Ciboney, and the Guanahatabey, but it also contains descriptions {{of many of the}} other indigenous cultures that Las Casas learned about through his travels and readings. The history is apologetic because it is written as a defense of the cultural level of the Indians, arguing throughout that indigenous peoples of the Americas were just as civilized as the Roman, Greek and Egyptian civilizations—and more civilized than some European civilizations. It was in essence a comparative ethnography comparing practices and customs of European and American cultures and evaluating them according to whether they were good or bad, seen from a Christian viewpoint.|$|E
5|$|The Black Stone {{was held}} in reverence well before the preaching of Islam by Muhammad. It had long been {{associated}} with the Kaaba, which was built in the pre-Islamic period and was a site of pilgrimage of Nabateans who visited the shrine once a year to perform their pilgrimage. The Kaaba held 360 idols of the Meccan gods. The Semitic <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Middle East had a tradition of using unusual stones to mark places of worship, a phenomenon which is reflected in the Hebrew Bible as well as the Qur'an, although bowing to or kissing such sacred objects is repeatedly described in the Tanakh as idolatrous and was the subject of prophetic rebuke. The meteorite-origin theory of the Black Stone has seen it likened by some writers to the meteorite which was placed and worshipped in the Greek Temple of Artemis. Some writers remark on the apparent similarity of the Black Stone and its frame to the external female genitalia, and ascribe this to its earlier association with fertility rites of Arabia.|$|E
