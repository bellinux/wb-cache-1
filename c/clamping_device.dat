25|$|The {{cable car}} begins moving when a <b>clamping</b> <b>device</b> {{attached}} to the car, called a grip, applies pressure to ("grips") the moving cable. Conversely, the car is stopped by releasing pressure on the cable (with or without completely detaching) and applying the brakes. This gripping and releasing action may be manual, {{as was the case}} in all early cable car systems, or automatic, as is the case in some recent cable operated people mover type systems. Gripping must be an even and gradual process in order to avoid bringing the car to cable speed too quickly and unacceptably jarring the passengers.|$|E

Different process splits have been experimentally evaluated {{to find the}} suitable doping concentration for optimizing the polysilicon diodes for both on-chip ESD protection design and the application requirements of the smart-card ICs. The secondary breakdown current (It 2) of the polysilicon diodes under the forward- and reverse-bias conditions has been measured by the transmission-line-pulse (TLP) generator to investigate its ESD robustness. Moreover, by adding an efficient VDD-to-VSS clamp circuit into the IC, the human-body-model (HBM) ESD robustness of the IC with polysilicon diodes as the ESD <b>clamp</b> <b>devices</b> has been successfully improved from the original 300 V to become 3 kV.

40|$|In an {{automated}} method for in vivo multiple cell patch clamping, cell patch <b>clamping</b> <b>devices</b> are automatically moved into position and targeted to multiple corresponding cells. Cell contact {{is determined by}} analyzing the temporal series of measured resistance levels at the <b>clamping</b> <b>devices</b> as they are moved. The difference between successive resistance levels is computed and compared to a threshold, which must be exceeded for a minimum number of computations before neuron contact is assumed. Pneumatic control methods are used to achieve cell-attached or gigaseal formation and subsequent cell break-in, leading to whole-cell patch clamp formation. An automated robotic system automatically performs patch clamping in vivo, automatically detecting cells according to the methodology by analyzing the temporal sequence of electrode impedance changes. By continuously monitoring the patching process and rapidly executing actions triggered by specific measurements, the robot can rapidly find neurons in the living brain and establish recordings.
