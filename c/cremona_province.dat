50|$|The Prehistoric Park (in Italian language: Parco della Preistoria) is an Italian naturalistic park of {{more than}} 100 {{hectares}} of secular wood, situated {{on the outskirts of}} the Rivolta d'Adda commune, <b>Cremona</b> <b>province,</b> about 20 kilometers east of Milan. The park is adjacent to the homonym Adda river and contains 30 reconstructions of prehistoric animals (including prehistoric men), a hundred semi-liberty wild animals, a botanical itinerary with plants signalled, natural environments (as: a swamp, lawns, lakes, etc.), picnic reggeds areas, a café, playing parks, a labyrinth, and shows of fossils, etc., all along a shaded course. The access to the park is exclusively pedestrian, but access is allowed to bicycles and dogs with leashes. The park is also recognized by various national and local corporate bodies that testify to the validity of the structure as a guide to the environmental education, not only to children, but of adults as well.|$|E
40|$|Sustainable {{landscape}} planning at the provincial level is explained through {{the example of}} the province of Cremona, Italy. Six topics are addressed. First, the topic of why planning in Italy, in general, and Cremona, more speciÆcally, is important will be addressed. <b>Cremona</b> <b>province</b> is located in northern Italy, where traditionally rural regions are facing expanding urbanization. Second, a background of Italian planning is provided. A 1990 law, in particular, emphasizes provincial-level planning. Third, the history and landscape of Cremona will be described. For most of its history, Cremona has been dominated by agriculture, which is reØected in the landscape. Fourth, the province of Cremona planning process will be summarized. The planning activity began in 1994 and continues to the present. Fifth, the design of a sustainability index is explained. The sustainability index is used to assess how land-use modiÆcations might affect the environment. Finally, the key lessons from the process will be noted. The Cremona provincial plan applies concepts of sustainability to a changing landscap...|$|E

40|$|Shallow water bodies {{dominate}} the areal extent of continental waters and host {{a proportion of}} biodiversity higher than the percentage of Earth’s surface they cover. Daphnia is {{a key component of}} small aquatic ecosystems food webs. Here we present the result of a survey in 24 ponds located in the core of Po river Basin, to assess the actual spreading of Daphnia species {{in one of the most}} productive areas of the Northern hemisphere. By using diagnostic genetic markers (12 S rRNA and ND 5 genes) we identified five Daphnia species: D. ambigua, D. curvirostris, D. longispina, D. obtusa and D. pulex in fourteen ponds. Additional analyses of two nuclear genes (LdhA and Rab 4) revealed that D. pulex in the study area is native European strain. In opposite, D. ambigua shared haplotype with the North-Eastern American lineage that was introduced to Europe by long-distance dispersal. In the Po river Basin we identified a highly divergent lineage of D. longispina group that formed a clade with individuals from northern European Russia and might represent a new Daphnia species. Daphnia species in the <b>Cremona</b> <b>province</b> have European origin, except for D. ambigua which is a North American species spreading across Europe. Future attention will require monitoring of invasive species, particularly D. ambigua and the North American invasive clone of D. pulex that is already present in Northern Italy.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Pure Holstein (HO, n= 430), crosses between Swedish Red and HO (SRxHO, n= 41), Montbeliarde and HO (MOxHO, n= 18), and MO and SRxHO (MOxSH, n= 53) were {{compared}} for milk, fat and protein yield, fat and protein percentage, somatic cell count (SCC), milking time (MT), and {{age at first}} and second calving. A total of 180, 933 test-day information for milk yield and MT, and 5, 249 for fat and protein percentage and SCC were recorded on first and second parity cows milked in one herd of <b>Cremona</b> <b>province</b> (northern Italy). Somatic cell count and MT were log-transformed to somatic cells score (SCS) and LnMT, respectively, before statistical investigation. Production traits, LnMT and SCS were analyzed through a mixed model that included fixed effects of test-day, parity, days in milk (DIM), genotype and interaction between parity and genotype, and the random effects of cow nested within genotype and residual, whereas the model for age at calving included year and month of calving and genotype as fixed effects, and residual as random. MOxHO and pure HO cows differed only for age at second calving (70 d higher for purebreds; P< 0. 05). Holsteins produced more milk (+ 2. 86 kg/d; P< 0. 01) and protein yield (+ 0. 05 kg/d; P< 0. 05) than SRxHO crossbreds, but lower protein percentage (- 0. 09 %; P< 0. 01), and age at second calving was 44 d (P< 0. 01) higher than SRxHO. Also, HO produced more milk and fat than MOxSH cows (+ 1. 61 and + 0. 08 kg/d, respectively; P< 0. 05), but lower protein percentage (- 0. 11 %; P< 0. 001), and calved later, both at first and second calving (+ 24 and + 43 d, respectively; P< 0. 05).

40|$|Cremona {{is a town}} {{founded on}} the left bank of the Po River, near {{the middle of the}} Po Valley, about 80 miles from Milan. The river banks became easily {{accessible}} {{at the end of the}} XIX century thanks the "Po avenue" construction and in the Thirties were built the masonry seats of the rowing clubs Baldesio and Bissolati, followed by the heliotherapy health camp “Colonie del Po". So was born the “Modern riverside” along the towpath. Still today the riverside is the destination for walking or cycling in every season, as well as a meeting place for members of the private rowing clubs. In this context, the former heliotherapy colony and its park, owned by the Municipality of Cremona, is the only public space available to the community. This building is, at the same time, the weak point and the potential of the riverside: it requires, in fact, an urgent restoration and a better use destination. The goal is to create a River Park with Visitor Center: it will house a permanent exhibition about the history of the “Modern riverside” and his link with the similar building in the Cremona territory, because in the thirties were built many heliotherapeutic colonies as the number of the Municipalities in the <b>Cremona</b> <b>Province.</b> In addition to the visitor center, the building will house also a public bar-restaurant and, in the garden, a public summer bar and solarium, swimming pool and bike sharing. This will be the way to connect the riverside and the city center in a new bigger itinerary that can be linked to the VENTO project, the touristic bicycle path Turin-Venice promoted for Expo 2015 by the Politecnico di Milano (Department Dastu), which already adhere the Municipality of Cremona and the clubs Baldesio and Bissolati. The first step to promote the entire project consists of 5 conferences about the riverside and the Modern that the Cremona Professional Body of Architects will held next year, 2014, to stimulate the community interest...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} is aimed to evaluating the impacts associated {{to the change}} of land use from agricultural and forest soils to artificial soils and estimating the losses of soil functions within the Lombardy region. Due to the available data sources, 5 years representative of different historical periods (1926, 1955, 1980, 1999 e 2007) have been examined, but due to the different scopes of the sources only the territory of Bergamo, Brescia and <b>Cremona</b> <b>provinces</b> where choosen for the completeness of data. As it is evident, each increase of the artificial soil reduces the agricultural soil, and it produces negative effects on the functionality of the soil. The effects considered in the paper are crops production losses and anthropic emissions increase; they are expressed {{by means of a}} set of indicators like CO 2 sequestration losses, potential agricultural production depletion, evapotraspirated water descrease and emission of energy/heat in the atmosphere...|$|R

40|$|We tested here a simple, hydrologically based, multi-year daily crop model called PolyCrop (PC), {{and tested}} {{it for the}} purpose of {{reproducing}} the dynamics of maize (Zea Mais L.) within two case study areas in the Po valley of Italy, namely Persico Dosimo (<b>Cremona</b> <b>province),</b> and Livraga (Lodi province), and to subsequently calculate water use therein, in the form of water footprint indicators. The model uses daily information of weather drivers given by temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation to simulate soil water budget, crop growth and crop yield, providing daily estimates of soil moisture, evapotranspiration, leaf area index LAI, and biomass. We simulated maize growth in Persico Dosimo using the PC, and the reference model from the literature Cropsyst (CS), and we validated our simulations against crop productivity data during 2001 - 2010. We then simulated maize growth in Livraga for 3 years (2010 - 2012), and we compared (i) actual evapotranspiration, and soil moisture against daily field measurements taken by an eddy covariance tower, and TDR probes, (ii) biomass against results from simulations with CS, and (iii) LAI against estimates from MODIS satellite images at 1 km resolution with eight-day frequency of acquisition. We then calculated water footprint (green water footprint, WFG, and blue water footprint, WFB) of maize in the area, defined as the absolute and specific (per kg yield) amount of water evapotranspired during the growing season, and we use PC and CS models to assess WFG, and WFB, under the present irrigation scheme. We benchmarked our WF estimates against available estimates in the reference literature. The PC model performs comparably well in depicting daily dynamics of maize growth, soil moisture, and LAI, and water footprint of the crop system, and therefore we are confident that it may be useful for crop growth simulation, as necessary to tackle a number of issues, including e. g. (i) assessment of crop productivity under current climate and management, (ii) short to medium term forecast of yield and soil moisture for a sustainable irrigation management, (iii) assessment of water usage of cropping systems, and (iv) modified crop and water footprint conditions under prospective climate change, using climate forcing from GCMs and other climate models. Future developments may regard inclusion of nutrient dynamics, which is not a limiting factor nowadays for growth in the Po valley, but may concern use of or crop model elsewhere, or here in the future. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

50|$|Several rivers {{flow across}} the Lombardy Plain {{to join the}} River Po which runs along the {{southern}} border of the province. The River Adda separates <b>Cremona</b> from the <b>Province</b> of Lodi and the River Oglio provides the border with the Province of Mantua. Other rivers {{in the north of}} the province include the River Serio and the River Tormo, and the River Mella makes up a short stretch of the border with the Province of Brescia. These rivers are linked by a network of canals which have been in place since at least the sixteenth century and are largely used for irrigation. The Muzza Canal takes its water from the River Adda and irrigates the land between that river and the River Ticino, converting the plain into a fertile area with rich meadows and productive agricultural land.|$|R
40|$|The future {{agreements}} on the LULUCF sector will probably implement {{the role of}} harvest wood products (HWP) for climate change mitigation. As highlighted by many Authors however, for Italy to quantify the amount of HWP will impose {{a number of issues}} mainly related to the inconsistency of the data provided by the National Institute for Statistic (ISTAT). New data collected by the National Forest and Carbon Inventory (INFC) will probably provide useful information. In the meantime, however, a comparison based on the forest area reported by INFC and data on HWP provided by ISTAT, both scaled at province level, could be proposed. The 2005 was assumed as reference year for both data sources. At this purpose, grouping the 103 Italian provinces in 9 groups mainly based on the 20 administrative regions, the Pearson coefficient of correlation was estimated, for each group, comparing the amount of harvest reported by ISTAT with (i) the forest area, (ii) the plantation area and (iii) the total forest area, including both plantations and forests. Possible outliers were identified estimating the harvest rates per hectare of forest and considering the interquantile range of these values. A linear model was finally applied between the total forest area and the total amount of harvest estimated at regional level. The results highlighted a strong correlation between the amount of harvest reported by ISTAT and the forest area reported by INFC for 13 out of 21 regions. For 5 regions, including Lombardia, Piemonte, Lazio, Umbria and Marche the amount of harvest was only correlated with the area of plantations. No correlation was detected for Toscana region. Based on the harvest rate per hectare, 5 provinces out of 103 were identified as outliers. The amount of harvest reported for 3 of these <b>provinces</b> (<b>Cremona,</b> Mantova and Pavia) was clearly referred to plantations. The analysis of the studentized residuals based on the application of the linear model, highlighted outliers values also for Piemonte region. As in the previous case, the amount of harvest reported for this region was probably partially referred to plantations. We could therefore speculate that for many regions data reported by national statistics as referred to the amount of harvest in forest, were statistically correlated with the forest area detected by INFC. However, for some important regions, such as Piemonte and Lombardia, they were clearly correlated with plantations...|$|R
