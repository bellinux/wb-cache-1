Pet Airways specialized in transporting pets, but failed as a business. In recent years private jet pet travel gained some momentum especially due to the discounted flight sales. In such travels pets are allowed in cabin with their owners which reduces stress and trauma.|$|R

The aircraft discussed are the DH 34, the Handley-Page W 8 B, the Farman Goliath, the Potez IX, the Spad 33 (Berline), and the Fokker F. III. The airplanes were evaluated with regard to seating comfort, ventilation, noise, seating arrangements, <b>cabin</b> doors, <b>baggage</b> accommodation, interior arrangement of cabins, pilot's position and communication with the pilot, pilot accommodations, view from the cabin, safety, and lavatory accommodations...|$|R
50|$|Questair Inc {{was founded}} by Ed MacDonough in the mid 1980s. The Venture was {{designed}} by Jim Griswold, an engineer with Piper Aircraft, and used technology from the Piper Malibu. The layout of the design was intended to combine a large two-seat side-by-side <b>cabin</b> with rear <b>baggage</b> space in the smallest possible airframe, having a highly streamlined design.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{increase}} in restrictions imposed on flights from UK airports and to the USA after the events of August 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot, hand baggage on such flights was restricted to one cabin bag no bigger than 45 cm &times; 35 cm &times; 16 cm effective since 15 August. On 21 September 2006, the British Airports Authority advised that from the following day, the allowable size of the single item of hand baggage on outgoing flights from the UK would be increased to 56 cm &times; 45 cm &times; 25 cm (approx. 22 in &times; 17.75 in &times; 9.85 in), the IATA guideline size. Most UK airports remain to have a strict limit of one piece of <b>cabin</b> <b>baggage</b> per passenger, including business class (allowed two pieces of <b>cabin</b> <b>baggage</b> within Europe, excluding flights {{to and from the}} UK).|$|E
50|$|The term {{hand luggage}} or <b>cabin</b> <b>baggage</b> (also {{commonly}} referred to as carry-on in North America) refers to the type of luggage that passengers are allowed to carry along in the passenger compartment of a vehicle instead of moving to the cargo compartment. Passengers are allowed to carry a limited number of smaller bags with them in the vehicle and contain valuables and items needed during the journey. There is normally storage space provided for hand luggage, either under seating, or in overhead lockers. Trains usually have luggage racks above the seats and may also (especially in the case of trains travelling longer distances) have luggage space between the backs of seats facing opposite directions, or in extra luggage racks, for example, at the ends of the carriage near the doors.|$|E
50|$|Supplemental Type Certificate SA5858S, {{issued by}} the American Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), held by the type allows for the {{installation}} of underwing pylons upon the Fan Jet Falcon, Fan Jet Falcon Series D and Fan Jet Falcon Series E. This modification has been commonly used upon those Falcon 20s which have been operated as special mission aircraft, which would often make use of underwing stores. Substantial numbers of Falcon 20s were converted into cargo-carrying configurations; a hydraulically-operated cargo door served to simplify loading-unloading operations. According to Flying Magazine, upon its launch, the Falcon 200 model had the largest cabin of any mid-seize business jet. Additionally, the rear fuselage of the Falcon 200 was re-designed to accommodate a 28-cubic foot baggage compartment within the tailcone, which supplements the standard aft <b>cabin</b> <b>baggage</b> compartment.|$|E
50|$|The Yak-42 is a low-winged {{monoplane}} of all-metal construction, with {{a design}} lifespan of 30,000 one-hour flights. It has a pressurised fuselage of circular section, with the cabin designed to carry 120 passengers in six-abreast layout (or 100 passengers for local services with greater space allocated to carry-on luggage and coat stowage). The aircraft is flown by a flight crew of two pilots sitting {{side by side}} in a flight deck forward of the cabin. Access is via two airstairs, one in the underside of the rear fuselage, like that of the Yak-40, and one forward of the cabin on the port side. Two holds are located under the <b>cabin,</b> carrying <b>baggage,</b> cargo and mail.|$|R
40|$|A {{low cost}} flight test data {{acquisition}} system, applicable to general aviation airplanes, was developed which meets criteria for doing longitudinal and lateral stability analysis. Th package consists of (1) a microprocessor controller and data acquisition module; (2) a transducer module; and (3) {{a power supply}} module. The system is easy to install and occupies space in the <b>cabin</b> or <b>baggage</b> compartment of the airplane. All transducers are contained in these modules except the total pressure tube, static pressure air temperature transducer, and control position transducers. The NASA-developed MMLE program was placed on a microcomputer on which all data reduction is done. The flight testing program undertaken proved both the flight testing hardware and the data reduction method to be applicable to the current field of general aviation airplanes...|$|R

Insecticide concentrations and insect mortality were observed in post-overhaul check flights, and insect mortality and passenger reactions were observed on scheduled flights between Miami, Florida, and Nassau, Bahamas...|$|R
5000|$|The {{actual size}} and weight limits of <b>cabin</b> <b>baggage</b> can differ widely, {{in some cases they}} are {{dependent}} on the aircraft model being used, in other cases it depends on the booking class. Due to the lack of standardization a large number of different specifications were created by the airlines on the maximum permitted cabin luggage restrictions (see below). In 2015 the IATA made an effort to introduce a common smaller size for cabin luggage by introducing the [...] "IATA Cabin OK" [...] logo. Major airlines have expressed their interest to accept luggage of that size on their flights. This is specified as 55 x 35 x 20 cm (or 21.5 x 13.5 x 7.5 inches). There were news that the move was backed by nine airlines including Lufthansa, Emirates and Qatar Airlines. The new size restrictions were criticised widely with the introduction program to be put on hold a few days later. Consequently none of the mentioned airlines has introduced the new format (by April 2016).|$|E

Dit artikel is alleen beschikbaar in het Nederlands. Nieuwe eisen voor het proces van veiligheidscontroles van passagiers en hun handbagage leiden ertoe dat luchthavens in toenemende mate gaan kiezen voor centrale inrichting van deze controles (i. t. t. decentrale security bij de gate). Bij centrale uitvoering valt het aanbod moeilijker te voorspellen en is het proces gevoeliger voor verstoringen. De fluctuaties in het passagiersaanbod verhogen de complexiteit van het afstemmen van vraag naar en aanbod van screeningscapaciteit. Nauwer samenwerken in de keten (opgezet vanuit het gedachtegoed van de extended enterprise) leidt tot beter afstemmen van vraag en aanbod en daardoor tot lagere kosten en hogere passagierstevredenheid.

40|$|Airports are fast-growing dynamic {{infrastructure}} assets. For example, the Canadian airport {{industry is}} growing by 5 % annually and generates about $ 8 billion yearly. Since the 9 / 11 tragedy, airport security {{has been of}} paramount importance both in Canada and worldwide. Consequently, in 2002, {{in the wake of}} the attacks, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) put into force revised aviation security standards and recommended practices, and began a Universal Security Audit Program (USAP), in order to insure the worldwide safeguarding of civil aviation in general, and of airports in particular, against unlawful interference. To improve aviation security at both the national level and for individual airport, airport authorities in North America have initiated extensive programs to help quantify, detect, deter, and mitigate security risk. At the research level, a number of studies have examined scenarios involving threats to airports, the factors that contribute to airport vulnerability, and decision support systems for security management. However, more work is still required in the area of developing decision support tools that can assist airport officials in meeting the challenges associated with decision about upgrades; determining the status of their security systems and efficiently allocating financial resources to improve them to the level required. To help airport authorities make cost-effective decisions about airport security upgrades, this research has developed a risk-based optimization framework. The framework assists airport officials in quantitatively assessing the status of threats to their airports, the vulnerability to their security systems, and the consequences of security breaches. A key element of this framework is a new quantitative security metric; the aim of which is to assist airport authorities self-assess the condition of their security systems, and to produce security risk indices that decision makers can use as prioritizing criteria and constraints when meeting decisions about security upgrades. These indices have been utilized to formulate an automated decision support system for upgrading security systems in airports. Because they represent one of the most important security systems in an airport, the research focuses on passenger and <b>cabin</b> <b>baggage</b> screening systems. Based on an analysis of the related threats, vulnerabilities and consequences throughout the flow of passengers, <b>cabin</b> <b>baggage,</b> and checked-in luggage, the proposed framework incorporates an optimization model for determining the most cost-effective countermeasures that can minimize security risks. For this purpose, the framework first calculates the level of possible improvement in security using a new risk metric. Among the important features of the framework is the fact that it allows airport officials to perform multiple “what-if” scenarios, to consider the limitations of security upgrade budgets, and to incorporate airport-specific requirements. Based on the received positive feedback from two actual airports, the framework can be extended to include other facets of security in airports, and to form a comprehensive asset management system for upgrading security at both single and multiple airports. From a broader perspective, this research contributes to the improvement of security in a major transportation sector that has an enormous impact on economic growth and on the welfare of regional, national and international societies...|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Falcon was rectangular {{in cross-section}} and flat sided {{apart from a}} slightly curved decking. It was almost entirely plywood covered. The nose had a simple, rounded, single curvature covering and formed the pilot's enclosed cockpit, with deep, almost continuous, vertical windows and another transparency in the roof. Six rows of wicker seats, separated by a central aisle, accommodated the twelve passengers in the front part of the fuselage behind the pilot, in a space 4 ft wide and 5 ft high. Behind this windowed <b>cabin</b> was a <b>baggage</b> store measuring 4 ft wide by 4 ft. The tailplane was mounted low down on the fuselage, carrying a pair of triangular fins with isosceles trapezoidal rudders.

The pilot's open cockpit, offset to port, was in the wing leading edge. The central, windowed part of the fuselage contained passengers and freight and was divided into three compartments. The forward one, under the wing, could either be given over to freight or contain two passenger seats.

6000|$|... "I'll tell it {{you from}} the beginning. Just sit me up a little, so as I can speak easy. It was in '83 that it happened--August of that year. Peter Carey was master of the SEA UNICORN, and I was spare harpooner. We {{were coming out of}} the ice-pack on our way home, with head winds and a week's southerly gale, when we picked up a little craft that had been blown north. There was one man on her--a landsman. The crew had thought she would founder and had made for the Norwegian coast in the dinghy. I guess they were all drowned. Well, we took him on board, this man, and he and the skipper had some long talks in the <b>cabin.</b> All the <b>baggage</b> we took off with him was one tin box. So far as I know, the man's name was never mentioned, and on the second night he {{disappeared}} as if he had never been. It was given out that he had either thrown himself overboard or fallen overboard in the heavy weather that we were having. Only one man knew what had happened to him, and that was me, for, with my own eyes, I saw the skipper tip up his heels and put him over the rail in the middle watch of a dark night, two days before we sighted the Shetland Lights. Well, I kept my knowledge to myself, and waited to see what would come of it. When we got back to Scotland it was easily hushed up, and nobody asked any questions. A stranger died by accident and it was nobody's business to inquire. Shortly after Peter Carey gave up the sea, and it was long years before I could find where he was. I guessed that he had done the deed for the sake of what was in that tin box, and that he could afford now to pay me well for keeping my mouth shut. I found out where he was through a sailor man that had met him in London, and down I went to squeeze him. The first night he was reasonable enough, and was ready to give me what would make me free of the sea for life. We were to fix it all two nights later. When I came, I found him three parts drunk and in a vile temper. We sat down and we drank and we yarned about old times, but the more he drank the less I liked the look on his face. I spotted that harpoon upon the wall, and I thought I might need it before I was through. Then at last he broke out at me, spitting and cursing, with murder in his eyes and a great clasp-knife in his hand. He had not time to get it from the sheath before I had the harpoon through him. Heavens! what a yell he gave! and his face gets between me and my sleep. I stood there, with his blood splashing round me, and I waited for a bit, but all was quiet, so I took heart once more. I looked round, and there was the tin box on the shelf. I had as much right to it as Peter Carey, anyhow, so I took it with me and left the hut. Like a fool I left my baccy-pouch upon the table.|$|R
