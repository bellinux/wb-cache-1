2500|$|Gaurs do {{not have}} a {{distinct}} dewlap on the throat and chest. Both sexes carry horns, which grow from the sides of the head, curving upwards. Between the horns is a high convex ridge on the forehead. At their bases they present an elliptical <b>cross-section,</b> <b>a</b> characteristic that is more strongly marked in bulls than in cows. The horns are decidedly flattened at the base and regularly curved throughout their length, and are bent inward and slightly backward at their tips. The colour of the horns is some shade of pale green or yellow throughout the greater part of their length, but the tips are black. The horns, of medium size by large bovid standards, grow to a length of [...]|$|E

50|$|A longbow {{is a type}} of bow that is tall—roughly {{equal to}} the height of the user; {{allowing}} the archer a fairly long draw, at least to the jaw. A longbow is not significantly recurved.
