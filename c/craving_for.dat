5|$|Chapters 5 and 6 {{discuss the}} means of {{cleansing}} the body and mind. The first ten verses of chapter 5 summarize and restate the need for always practicing virtuous self-restraints (Yamas), observances (Niyamas), avoiding anger against anyone or anything, truthfully following Dharma, respecting and learning from the Guru (teacher), and pursuing the proper goals of life without <b>craving</b> <b>for</b> rewards of one's action.|$|E

5|$|After moving in, Moon began a {{prescribed}} course of Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a sedative) to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He {{wanted to get}} sober, but due to his fear of psychiatric hospitals {{he wanted to do}} it at home. Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moon's lifestyle. Dymond prescribed a bottle of 100 pills, instructing him to take one pill when he felt a <b>craving</b> <b>for</b> alcohol but not more than three pills per day.|$|E

5|$|Yajnavalkya {{states that}} there are two paths to attain {{knowledge}}. One path is Pravritti-karma, wherein a person is driven by desire and a <b>craving</b> <b>for</b> rewards, forms his will, and then uses his knowledge to act out his free will. The second path is Nivritti-karma, wherein a person is not driven by desire and does not crave for rewards, but he uses his knowledge in his works in a detached way. The Pravritti-karma path is the cause for suffering and rebirth, while the Nivritti-karma is liberating and practiced by those who want to end suffering and rebirth.|$|E
5|$|The Varaha, in the 83 {{verses of}} Chapter 2, {{explains}} to Ribhu {{how to achieve}} the most exalted knowledge of Brahmavidya, and then what it is. He tells Ribhu that the four means of this knowledge are to practice conduct of one's Varna (caste) and one's Ashrama (stage in life), from ascetic austerity {{and with the help}} of a Guru (spiritual teacher). The Varaha then states that the path to Brahmavidya is through the capacity to distinguish between the ephemeral and the eternal, detachment from the material world unto the spiritual world. A sincere longing for spiritual liberation and six virtuous qualities (shama) are essential in order to achieve Brahmavidya, asserts the Upanishad, these being tranquility, self-restraint, doing work without <b>craving</b> <b>for</b> rewards, endurance, faith, and meditation. Varaha states in verse 2.4 that the truly blessed are those who know Brahman and Atman and have thus become one with them.|$|E

The {{students}} are all disabled, retarded and of different ages. Teaching them is a hard job. They are of the 3rd grade {{but many of them}} find it hard to do the reading. Only a few of them can.

Some in their twenties have a physical statures as small as the 7- or 8-years-old. They find it difficult to feed themselves, much less have mental ability or physical capacity for work.

25|$|Dukkha Samudaya (cause of suffering): Craving, {{which leads}} to Attachment and Bondage, {{is the cause of}} suffering. Formally, this is termed Tanha. It can be {{classified}} into three instinctive drives. Kama Tanha is the <b>Craving</b> <b>for</b> any pleasurable sense object (which involves sight, sound, touch, taste, smell and mental perceptives). Bhava Tanha is the <b>Craving</b> <b>for</b> attachment to an ongoing process, which appears in various forms, including the longing for existence. Vibhava Tanha is the <b>Craving</b> <b>for</b> detachment from a process, which includes non-existence and causes the longing for self-annihilation.|$|E

25|$|Dukkha {{arises when}} we crave (Pali: tanha) and cling to these {{changing}} phenomena. The clinging and craving produces karma, which ties us to samsara, {{the round of}} death and rebirth. Craving includes kama-tanha, <b>craving</b> <b>for</b> sense-pleasures; bhava-tanha, craving to continue the cycle of life and death, including rebirth; and vibhava-tanha, craving to not experience the world and painful feelings.|$|E

25|$|As {{with the}} Yamas, Patanjali {{explains}} {{how and why}} each of the above Niyamas help in the personal growth of an individual.

25|$|Vibhava-taṇhā (<b>craving</b> <b>for</b> non-existence): craving to not {{experience}} unpleasant {{things in the}} current or future life, such as unpleasant people or situations. This sort of craving may include attempts at suicide and self-annihilation, and this only results in further rebirth in a worse realm of existence. This type of craving, states Phra Thepyanmongkol, {{is driven by the}} wrong view of annihilationism, that there is no rebirth.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} symptom is <b>craving</b> <b>for</b> dopaminergic medication. However other {{behavioral}} symptoms can appear independently of craving or co-occur with it. Craving is an intense impulse {{of the subject}} to obtain medication {{even in the absence}} of symptoms that indicate its intake. To fulfill this need the person will self-administer extra doses. When self-administration is not possible, aggressive outbursts or the use of strategies such as symptom simulation or bribery to access additional medication can also appear.|$|E
