There, lack of timber in the shipyards, that were already busy building Languedoc, Zélé and Bourgogne, delayed the construction of Marseillois until 1764. Her building was directed by the engineer Chapelle.|$|E

An isolated electron {{at a constant}} velocity cannot emit or absorb a real photon; doing so would violate conservation of energy and momentum. Instead, virtual photons can transfer momentum between two charged particles. This exchange of virtual photons, for example, generates the <b>Coulomb</b> force. Energy emission can occur when a moving electron is deflected by a charged particle, such as a proton. The acceleration of the electron results in the emission of Bremsstrahlung radiation.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrostatic}} force was first described in 1784 by <b>Coulomb</b> {{as a force}} that existed intrinsically between two charges. The properties of the {{electrostatic force}} were that it varied as an inverse square law directed in the radial direction, was both attractive and repulsive (there was intrinsic polarity), was independent {{of the mass of}} the charged objects, and followed the superposition principle.

25|$|With Blavatsky in Europe, trouble {{broke out}} at the society's Adyar {{headquarters}} in {{what became known as}} the <b>Coulomb</b> Affair. The society's Board of Control had accused Emma <b>Coulomb</b> of misappropriating their funds for her own purposes, and asked her to leave their center. She and her husband refused, blackmailing the society with letters that they claimed were written by Blavatsky and which proved that her paranormal abilities were fraudulent. The society refused to pay them and expelled them from their premises, at which the couple turned to the Madras-based Christian College Magazine, who published an expose of Blavatsky's alleged fraudulence using the Coulomb's claims as a basis. The story attracted international attention and was picked up by London-based newspaper, The Times. In response, in November 1884 Blavatsky headed to Cairo, where she and Theosophist Charles Webster Leadbeater searched for negative information on Emma <b>Coulomb,</b> discovering stories of her alleged former history of extortion and criminality. Internally, the Society was greatly damaged by the <b>Coulomb</b> Affair, although it remained popular in India, as did Blavatsky herself.|$|E
25|$|The {{understanding}} of friction was further developed by Charles-Augustin de <b>Coulomb</b> (1785). <b>Coulomb</b> investigated {{the influence of}} four main factors on friction: {{the nature of the}} materials in contact and their surface coatings; the extent of the surface area; the normal pressure (or load); and the length of time that the surfaces remained in contact (time of repose). <b>Coulomb</b> further considered the influence of sliding velocity, temperature and humidity, in order to decide between the different explanations on the nature of friction that had been proposed. The distinction between static and dynamic friction is made in Coulomb's friction law (see below), although this distinction was already drawn by Johann Andreas von Segner in 1758.|$|E
