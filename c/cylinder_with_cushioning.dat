40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the effect of bottom and top {{configurations}} on pool film boiling heat transfer from a vertical <b>cylinder</b> <b>with</b> a length comparable to the diameter, five kinds of silver <b>cylinder</b> <b>with</b> flat, hemispherical and conical end surfaces were tested by quenching in saturated and subcooled water. For saturated water, the wall heat flux averaged over the total surface of a finite-length cylinder takes a higher value for the <b>cylinder</b> <b>with</b> a conical bottom than those for the other four types as the wall superheat decreases. For highly subcooled bulk water, the average wall heat flux for the <b>cylinder</b> <b>with</b> a flat bottom becomes larger than those for the <b>cylinder</b> <b>with</b> hemispherical and conical bottoms. This is attributed that the <b>cylinder</b> <b>with</b> a flat bottom has quite a thin vapor film {{at the lower end}} of the vertical finite-length cylinder due to the edge effect...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare X-rays usually {{performed}} in supine with lateralization {{with those in}} lateral decubitus with fulcrum {{at the apex of}} the primary curve caused by cushion, in order to monitor the achievement of improvement patterns of correction in preestablished deformities for the preoperative surgical planning. METHODS: Comparison of radiographic studies in the preoperative supine with lateralization and lateral decubitus <b>with</b> <b>cushion</b> performing fulcrum at the apex of the major curve in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. RESULTS: Curves varied in AP between 76 &# 176; e 40 &# 176; and were corrected in supine with lateralization to the average of 21 &# 176; observing that when carried out <b>with</b> fulcrum <b>with</b> <b>cushion</b> in lateral decubitus the curves were corrected to 15 &# 176; on average with higher discrepancy in values among the most rigid curves. CONCLUSIONS: It was verified that on flexible curves the cushions did not produce satisfactory corrections in primary curves. In more rigid curves and in collaborative patients, greater effectiveness on the correction of deformity in main curves was obtained <b>with</b> <b>cushions</b> producing local fulcrum for a better preoperative planning on correction of deformities...|$|R
