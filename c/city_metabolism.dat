30|$|There is {{a growing}} {{scientific}} consensus that the climate is changing (Hartter et al. 2018), and the impacts on the coastal zone {{can be in the}} form of sea-level rise, the increase in the frequency of extreme wind events, the change of the annual frequency of winds, the increase in storm surge events frequency, higher waves, changes in wave direction and changes in coastal currents (Karambas 2015). These impacts can result in urban flooding events of varying intensities ultimately affecting the prevailing <b>city</b> <b>metabolism.</b> The impacts of the changing climate are exacerbated in urban areas due to the immense anthropogenic activities centred around these regions. All the cities addressed in this study have been through recent flood problems related to the changing climate. There are less studies addressing the climate change impacts on the flood events in these urban areas, and there is a knowledge gap regarding these realms.|$|E

40|$|Assuming {{communities}} {{in a city}} may formally express their aspirations for the future sustainability of their city, which technological innovations for changing the <b>city's</b> infrastructure and <b>metabolism</b> might they introduce today, {{as a first step}} towards realizing their distant aspirations? What is more, recognizing the diversity of aspirations that may never be reconciled into a consensus, might some innovations and policy interventions be nevertheless more privileged than others, in being non-foreclosing? How might we discover this? These questions are addressed through a computational case study of London. The <b>city's</b> <b>metabolism</b> is modeled as the set of interacting, cross-sectoral (water, food, energy, waste) flows of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), water, and energy. Given various degrees of target improvements in an accompanying set of metabolic performance metrics, and given four candidate technological innovations in the water sector, an inverse (or “backcasting”) analysis is implemented in order to identify the key technological, policy, social, and climate-related features determining whether the community's aspirations — through the surrogates of the metabolic performance metrics — are attainable (or not), under substantial uncertainty. From this, the paper proceeds to examine which businesses are currently marketing some of the so-identified key technological innovations. It closes with a brief review of the related status of the economic justifications and social changes that may either promote or stifle the opportunities for London to move towards a higher niveau of sustainability...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the methodology and data {{used to determine}} greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions attributable to ten cities or city-regions: Los Angeles County, Denver City and County, Greater Toronto, New York City, Greater London, Geneva Canton, Greater Prague, Barcelona, Cape Town and Bangkok. Equations for determining emissions are developed for contributions from: electricity; heating and industrial fuels; ground transportation fuels; air and marine fuels; industrial processes; and waste. Gasoline consumption is estimated using three approaches: from local fuel sales; by scaling from regional fuel sales; and from counts of vehicle kilometres travelled. A simplified version of an {{intergovernmental panel on climate}} change (IPCC) method for estimating the GHG emissions from landfill waste is applied. Three measures of overall emissions are suggested: (i) actual emissions within the boundary of the city; (ii) single process emissions (from a life-cycle perspective) associated with the city's metabolism; and (iii) life-cycle emissions associated with the <b>city's</b> <b>metabolism.</b> The results and analysis of the study will be published in a second paper.

The {{aim was to}} determine the characteristic of urban heat island in the city during rainy season periods. The study was undertaken in Enugu municipality in the months of June – July of 2006 and 2007. The results indicate that UHI at day and night during rainy season were very different. A downtown –centered heat island was observed both day and night. The day time variations were strongly correlated to the amount of tree shading while in the night, city climate was highly correlated to sky-view factors and thermal properties in the city. Maximum UHI was about 32 c during the day and hour-to-hour difference was observed at night around (1800 hrs to 2300 hrs). UHI over Enugu have been analyzed and results reveal some spatial and temporal characteristics. The UHI has been found to occur throughout the day and night during rainy season. Its structure was observed to be greatly influenced by weather, <b>city,</b> <b>metabolism,</b> anthropogenic activities and local geographic features, land-use, land-cover as well as vegetation and population...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{renovation}} of buildings {{is a general}} recommendation {{in order to reduce}} the operational energy consumption and their emissions associated. Besides, the {{renovation of}} buildings allows reusing materials, increasing the building life service and avoiding the deconstruction and new construction impacts. However, it is necessary to be aware that the intervention itself generate an impact (embodied energy, transportation and construction process), and sometimes, energy systems upgrading does not mean a consumption reduction and it also have influence on the <b>city</b> <b>metabolism.</b> The European Union and the Royal Institute of British Architecture have defined strategies {{in order to reduce the}} impact associated to buildings through renovations or refurbishments, however, both approaches have differences in their own standpoint. Besides, there are many concepts and terms associated to renovation that do not allow to clarify the objective with a technical and rigorously perspective. Facing the current uncertainties, life cycle assessment technique allows focusing on an already confirmed methodology in order to evaluate the potential environmental impacts associated to the renovation of buildings. While environmental impact on new construction is highly addressed, publication of refurbishment’s environmental impact is lacking in the academic literature. The used materials in construction phase of conventional building accounts for 20 % of the total life cycle impact, while the operation energy is around 80 %. However, recent researches show how as we design buildings with lower energy consumption the previous balance is levelling, and thus the weight of the materials on the total impact of the building is around 40 % compared to 60 % of operating energy. Therefore, in this communication are shown the current approaches and concepts in an international context to define a low environmental impact renovation. Firstly, it is proposed a classification of the renovation impacts according to the rebound effect theory. Secondly, it has been done a review of the academic literature that has used the life cycle assessment to evaluate the renovation of buildings, where convergences and divergences has been found between authors. Finally, it concludes highlighting those common perspectives and what fields are needed to develop in order to get a holistic and global approach of the environmental impact of renovation of buildings...|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to material flow and stock analyses, {{it is also}} important to quantitatively analyze the environmental efficiency of a city in order to assess the sustainability of a <b>city’s</b> <b>metabolism</b> (Zhang et al. 2015). Huppes and Ishikawa (2007) classified environmental efficiency into the following four indicators: (1) environmental productivity (i.e., production or consumption value per unit of environmental impact), (2) environmental intensity (i.e., environmental impact per unit of production or consumption value), (3) environmental improvement cost (i.e., cost per unit of environmental improvement), and (4) environmental cost-effectiveness (i.e., environmental improvement per unit of cost). In an environmental efficiency analysis based on the indicators shown above, for example, Browne et al. (2009) considered the second indicator, environmental intensity, and estimated the ratio of waste discharge to product consumption in Limerick, Ireland. In addition, Zhang et al. (2013) considered the second indicator and estimated the ratio of waste displacement to resource displacement within an area of Beijing, China. However, these studies did not consider desirable outputs (GDP, etc.) generated by production activity and the factor inputs required the production activity and they did not analyze economic efficiency based on the input–output data.|$|R
40|$|Knowledge {{about the}} {{characteristics}} and driving forces of material flows {{in urban areas}} is crucial, as the pathways towards sustainability depend on local conditions. Currently, Urban Metabolism research focuses on the analysis of trends and transitions in different stages of city development, on developing classification systems and identification of metabolism profiles for urban areas. A novel framework for characterizing <b>cities</b> <b>metabolism</b> is provided using Urban Material Flow Accounting indicators as the basis. A Material Flow Accounting study is conducted for three cities in Sweden, from 1996 until 2011 : Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmo. Based on the urban metabolism characteristics framework, three distinct profiles are proposed: consumer-service; industrial; and transitioning. Stockholm's material needs are mainly for final consumption. When compared {{with the other two}} cities, material flows follow a more stable trend and have lower dependency on external systems due to the marginal production and export of goods. Gothenburg has the most resource intensive metabolism. It requires several times larger material inputs than the other two cities and produces much larger outputs, for benefit {{of the rest of the}} country and the world. Consequently, CO 2 emissions are higher in Gothenburg. Malmo characteristics are more complex than Stockholm's with higher material needs in particular construction minerals. Its dependency on external flows is low, due to the fact that the economy and exports are based on domestically extracted Non-Metallic Minerals and Biomass...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring {{the process}} of {{building}} the sustainable development paradigm in the last four decades, the incorporation and integration of the urban dimension has been gaining importance, while it has been acknowledged {{that the majority of the}} most serious environmental threats are exacerbated by the high density and activity of urban life and its consumption patterns. Thus, different methods, techniques and instruments for urban sustainable assessment that seek to figure out how cities can become more sustainable have emerged. Among which, indicators are increasingly used as they provide a solid foundation for decision making, at all levels, and contributes to the building of sustainable self-regulated systems in which development and environment can be integrated. The present paper builds on the background of the recent movement towards the usage of indicators by introducing a carefully chosen set for quantifying sustainability performance at the urban level and into the planning process. By moving indicators from the ex-post evaluation of cities’ problems to an ex-ante stage in which they can be operationalized as planning tools, this piece of work provides a contribution to traditional urban planning instruments and moves a step forward with regard to the construction of sustainability. In this framework indicators become key instruments in urban analysis, the design of policies, strategies, actions and programs for sustainable urban development. The paper starts by introducing the methodology and the urban sustainable indicators system for planning. This model then is tested and applied in a case study based on Mexico <b>City's</b> <b>metabolism.</b> Finally, the study provides a series of reflections on how successful strategies to enhance the long-term sustainability of cities can be developed by introducing sustainability indicators into the urban planning process...|$|R
40|$|The {{main issue}} of this project is waste {{and how we can}} better deal with it. We have to make clear at this point that being myself an {{architect}} the whole project has been approached through an architectural point of view. I firmly {{believe that there is a}} clear and clean way of solving it. So, When waste can be a problem? Everything that is brought into existence plays a role in the production of waste as a side effect. Everything that prospers and lives exceeds the waste and whatever dies or is not used anymore, becomes a waste. So to say, waste are the traces of every life and existence on earth, and this is inevitable. Therefore, we have to see waste as natural. In the nature as the ecosystem the waste from one process are always reused into another one as a ready product to process. Waste is a problem only among humans. And it becomes a problem only when pollution appears [...] . And pollution appears only when there is too much waste on a given area and natural decay cannot take place. Let’s have a look on our system. Our system is more wasteful than any other before. We focus on the quantity of products and not on the quality or sustainability of production process. We forget that everything we use is highly processed due to the achievements of production, and impossible to degrade it in a short term of time. Planned Obsolescence and highly processed goods. Economize in the terminology means [...] . that our economy from a practical and theoretical standpoint, is wrong in the term of dealing with the waste. It does not take into account that resources are not infinite and recycling is on the very low level. It is more down-cycling. The largest centers of economy and production are big cities in developed countries. These are the accelerators of economical growth and in reverse its biggest outcome/result/product. Moreover there exactly is where the problem begins. We do not usually see the waste since municipalities collect the trash to the down-cycling centers or exceed those into land fields or even ship them to developing countries. Where the waste become a visible problem, but in reality it is only a result of the global economy. Therefore, the project has to be settled in a city that belongs to a developed country. I chose to deal architecturally with the Municipal Solid waste among a variety of different types. That way we can show how to solve in the tangible way the small part of the whole pending problem, from the beginning till the end, while being accurate with technological possibilities and capacities of our times. Because the current problems have to be solved now, not later, through architecture which its function is to be a city supplement, i. e. the part that completes and encloses the <b>city</b> <b>metabolism</b> in the field of domestic waste. In order to create such a supplement, a vast research has been made in the technologies of recycling, fields of science and additional functions that are necessary to connect to create such a project. A team of scientists, researchers, architects and designers is needed. Interdisciplinary function will provide the best performance. The overriding function of the building becomes a Research Institute for investigating new technologies in waste recycling, building prototypes from recycled materials that will be used in a city as a decentralized units for waste recycling inside the city as well as architectural elements created from recycled materials that can be used in the design of future buildings, that are sustainable and collect, create and save water and energy.

40|$|AbstractCarbon fluxes {{scenario}} within {{urban areas}} {{plays an important}} role in the global carbon cycle, which is critical for the adjustment of urban development activities influencing our living environment. Adapting network environ theory, a generic metabolic model is developed in this study for carbon metabolism in urban areas, in which compartmental utility analysis and system performance assessment are featured. Taking carbon dynamic of Hong Kong as a case study, the metabolic flows within urban carbon balance are illustrated though two analogous input/output networks. Based on this, the compartmental mutual relationships between different urban sectors are addressed and the overall properties of the <b>city's</b> carbon <b>metabolism</b> are aggregately evaluated. Our findings showed that each metabolic component has its specific mutual relations with other components connected, playing a unique role within the ecological system. As to Hong Kong's case, specifically, the metabolic system is considered self-mutual and stable when incorporating its interactions with its supporting environment. In light of these insights, potential extensions and applications of the network-based metabolic model in future are discussed. The recommendation is that the tracking of interactive relationships and pathways from network environ perspective be incorporated into present urban metabolism study for a more comprehensive sustainable urban design...|$|R

This paper centers on estimating the emissions due to seaports, {{in such a way}} that they can be included as part of the city's inventory or be used by the port itself to monitor their policy and technology improvements for mitigating climate change. We propose the indicators GHG emissions per ton of cargo handled or per passenger and emissions per value of cargo handled as practical measures for policy making and emission prevention measures to be monitored over time. Adapting existing methodologies to the Port of Barcelona, we calculated a total of 331, 390 tons of GHG emissions (CO 2 equivalents) for the year of 2008, half of which were attributed to vessel movement (sea-based emissions) and the other half to port, land related activities (land-based emissions). The highest polluters were auto carriers with 6 Â kg of GHG emissions per ton of cargo handled. Knowing the highest emitters, the port can take action to improve the ship's activities within the port limits, such as maneuvering and hotelling. With these results, the port and the city can also find ways to reduce the land-based emissions. GHG emissions Ports Sea-based emissions...|$|R

40|$|Urban {{metabolism}} {{analysis has}} become an important tool {{for the study of}} urban ecosystems. The <b>metabolism</b> of a <b>city</b> {{can be seen as the}} processes by which the city transforms the materials and energy it requires to sustain its socioeconomic activity. In the present study, we analyzed the anabolic and catabolic flows that occur during Macao's urbanization processes. Macao is a tourist city with a dense population, but is short on natural resources; thus, most of its life-support services depend on resource imports from outside its system. We used mass, energy, and emergy analysis to quantify the metabolic processes that occurred in Macao in 2013. Macao's anabolic and catabolic density both increased to high levels due to a tremendous influx of visitors in 2013. By employing systems ecology based on mass, energy, and emergy metrics, we were able to quantitatively describe the <b>city's</b> resource <b>metabolism.</b> We found that by relying on a large amount of inflows to support anabolism compared with catabolic flows, Macao was able to absorb large amounts of negative-entropy materials, and that these flows of resources supported both its survival and its booming development. We also found tremendously high heat dissipation, and that after accounting for catabolism, the city retained less than 10 % of the total input for anabolism. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Earth system–level loops from cities to neighboring ecosystems are identified. Megacities are somewhat independent of their immediate environment for food, fuel, and aggregate inputs, but all are constrained by their regional environment for supplying water and absorbing wastes. We elaborate on analogies with biological metabolism and ecosystem succession as useful concep-tual frameworks for addressing urban ecological problems.
