40|$|This is a {{profound}} biography of the eminent ethologist and Nobel Laureate Nikolaas Tinbergen (1907 - 1988). Tinbergen {{has been one of}} my scientific heroes for many years, with his brilliant focus on the four whys, his emphasis on the importance of observation and naturalistic studies, his all-time classic ”The Study of Instinct”, and his many inspiring field experiments, such as the egg shell removal in blackheaded gulls (an antipredator tactic). For my own opus magnum about humans and evolution, I read everything I could dig up about Tinbergen and his life, to write an eight-page minibiography of him (Mysterud 2003). Strangely, although several biographies have been written about Konrad Lorenz, who with Karl von Frisch was Tinbergen’s <b>co-sharer</b> of the Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology in 1973, no biography of Tinbergen had been written before Kruuk’s. Kruuk himself is a much respected scientist, who grew up in Holland, completed his PhD under Tinbergen at Oxford, and co-founded and co-directed the Serengeti Research Institute in East Africa. He has studied the behavior and ecology of many different mammals, birds, and fishes all over the world, including gulls...|$|E

Ramjivan's daughter-in-law was Rani Bhawani (1716-1795), a legendary name in Bengal {{politics}} in the 18th century and an endearing personality in everyhome of the country due to her boundless generosity and public spirit. After becoming Zamindar Ramjivan built his Rajbari at Natore occupying a huge area of 50.42 acres of land and it is enclosed within two rings of defensive moats-one within the other. The moats are now dotted with large tanks,orchards and flower gardens surrounding the derelict ruins of the seven surviving detached palaces. Of these only four deserve description while the rest are in advanced stage of disintegration and are of no architectural significance. After the death of the great queen, her adopted son Ramkrishna ruled the area. After his death, his two sons Sibnath and Vishwanath became the <b>co-sharers</b> of the Natore Zamindari in 1778. The whole Zamindari was divided between them, and the part of the eldest son was known as [...] "Boro Taraf" [...] and the part of the youngest son was known as [...] "Chhoto Taraf". The Rajbari was protected on all sides by ditches. There were nine buildings in this Rajbari. They are the palace of Boro Taraf, the palace of Choto Taraf, Kachari Bhavan and Guard House of Boro Taraf, Kachari Bhavan of Choto Taraf, Rani Bhavan, Guest House, Madhu Rani Bhavan etc.|$|R
