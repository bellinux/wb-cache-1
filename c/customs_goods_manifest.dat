40|$|This work {{addresses}} how {{the number}} of suppliers employed by a manufacturer relates to its use of electronic procurement (e-procurement). Using data from the U. S. manufacturing industry, we find a surprising result that there is non-correlation between e-procurement and number of suppliers at the aggregate level. However, when we distinguish the type of goods purchased, we find that e-procurement is associated with using more suppliers for <b>custom</b> <b>goods</b> while fewer suppliers for standard goods. The finding for <b>custom</b> <b>goods</b> may sound contradictive to the prior literature proposing a "move to the middle," but {{is consistent with a}} TCE-based notion that <b>custom</b> <b>goods</b> procurement involves more asset-specific relationships than standard goods. Further, the positive association between e-procurement and number of suppliers of <b>custom</b> <b>goods</b> is negatively moderated by the degree of buyer-supplier systems integration, which is consistent with the argument that deeper integration of buyer and supplier information systems can help buyers obtain better "fit" for their customized requirements. This is an alternative to achieving better fit by employing more suppliers as proposed in the extant literature. © 2008 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} relationship between a manufacturer's use of information technology (IT) (particularly electronic procurement) and the number of suppliers in its supply chain. Will a manufacturer use more or fewer suppliers due to the increasing use of IT? Based on data from a sample of 150 U. S. manufacturers, we find no direct relationship between e-procurement and number of suppliers at the aggregate level. However, when we distinguish the type of goods purchased, we find that the use of electronic procurement is associated with buying from more suppliers for <b>custom</b> <b>goods</b> but from fewer suppliers for standard (or commodity) goods. It is possible that for commodity goods, an efficiently functioning transparent market ensures that a few suppliers are sufficient, whereas for <b>custom</b> <b>goods</b> the need for protection from opportunistic vendor holdup leads to the use of more suppliers. Further, the positive relationship between number of suppliers and electronic procurement for <b>custom</b> <b>goods</b> is negatively moderated by deeper buyer-supplier system integration. This implies that such integration can help buyers obtain better "fit" for their customized requirements, an alternative to increasing fit by employing more suppliers as proposed in the extant literature...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, foreign market entry has {{continued}} to {{play a critical role}} in global economic development. Because of dynamics and complexity of entry modes and the influences of many variables, decision making on selection of international market entry strategies is a difficult task. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the strategic variables determining foreign market entry strategies. In every study, a different set of variables and findings has entered, which are often inconsistent. Hence, this study intends to identify the factors affecting selection of foreign market entry strategies and their influences on the selection. For this purpose, the content and types of foreign market entry strategies have been introduced by studying relevant literature. These strategies have been then divided into three main categories of export strategies, non-export strategies, and intermediate strategies. Then, the factors that make effect on selection of these strategies have been identified and classified. Finally, all factors are used to form two separate structural equation models (SEMs) based on the theory of Strategic Reference Points and respectively it has been explained that how foreign entry strategies are chosen according to these reference points. To support this explanation empirically, 42 export companies of food industry have been studied in Mazandaran. SPSS 18, MINITAB 15, and AMOS 18 have been used for analyzing and testing the research hypotheses. Findings imply that uncertainty of host country, uncertainty of product market, competitive uncertainty, uncertainty of partner behavior, international experience, technical knowledge, marketing skills, total investment, competitive intensity, nature of foreign activity, attractiveness of location and business relatedness affect selecting foreign market entry strategies. Moreover, with our SEMs, Attractiveness of location, language diversity and uncertainty of the host country are proved to be <b>good</b> <b>manifests</b> of the companies' strategic focus. Uncertainty of host country, uncertainty of product market, competitive uncertainty, international experience, firm size, technical knowledge, marketing skill, total investment, business relatedness and the nature of foreign activity are <b>good</b> <b>manifests</b> for the companies’ desired degree of control over their foreign activities...|$|R
