40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} a strong bias in both human and non-human species for <b>cradling</b> their infants {{to the left side}} of the body. Most studies suggest that the main reason this phenomenon is the predominance of the right hemisphere of the brain for the processing of emotions and its transference, through brain laterality, to {{the left side of the}} body. Many other variables, including handedness, footedness, stress and depression have also been found to have some effect on <b>cradling</b> side. However, no study has been published for an Arab population. Given the strong religious and cultural belief of most Arabs that only the right hand should be used for most daily tasks, this study investigated the affect on <b>cradling</b> side of this habit, in addition to the factors named above. 369 Saudi citizens took part in this study. 234 lived in Saudi Arabia and 135 had lived in the UK for five or more years. 267 were women and 102 were men. Each answered a questionnaire which asked about their ‘preferred’ <b>cradling</b> side and then the 102 men were videotaped spontaneously <b>cradling</b> a real infant and an infant-like doll. Unfortunately, only the male sample could be videotaped due to restrictions on filming females in Saudi Arabia. The results confirmed those of previous studies by showing a very strong bias to leftside <b>cradling.</b> No difference was found between males and females in <b>cradling</b> a doll, or between the Saudi-based sample and the UK-based sample but the bias was significantly reduced in men. Apart from the influence of gender, the factors that reduced the <b>cradling</b> bias for a real infant were found to be lack of experience of parenthood, depression, stress and greater age of the infant. In <b>cradling</b> a doll, the most influential variables were handedness, footedness and depression. Further work is required on Arab samples, especially in examining spontaneous <b>cradling</b> by women and its relation to depression and stress. A mother’s mental state is known to affect the health of the infant and <b>cradling</b> side could be a useful filter for neonatal women who might require psychiatric treatment. Further research could also shed light on gender differences in the processing of emotion. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{mitigating}} the visually displeasing effects of <b>cradling</b> in X-ray images of panel paintings. The proposed algorithm consists of three stages. In the first stage the location of the <b>cradling</b> is detected semi-automatically and the grayscale inconsistency, caused by the thickness of the <b>cradling,</b> is adjusted. In a second stage we use a blind source separation method to decompose the X-ray image into a so-called cartoon part and a texture part, where the latter contains mostly the wood grain from both the panel as well as the <b>cradling.</b> In the third and final stage the algorithm tries to learn the distinction between the texture patterns that originate from the <b>cradling</b> and those from other components such as the panel and/or the painting. The goal of the proposed research is to improve the readability of X-ray images of paintings for art experts...|$|R

5|$|Natalya {{programs}} {{the satellite}} to initiate atmospheric re-entry and destroy itself. As Trevelyan captures Natalya and orders Grishenko {{to save the}} satellite, Boris unwittingly triggers an explosion with Bond's pen grenade (received earlier from Q), which allows Bond to escape to the antenna <b>cradle.</b> Bond sabotages the antenna, preventing Grishenko from regaining control of the satellite. Bond and Trevelyan fight on the antenna's suspended platform, which finishes with Bond holding a dangling Trevelyan by his foot. Bond releases Trevelyan, who plummets into the dish. Seconds later the <b>cradle</b> explodes, and falls, crushing and killing Trevelyan and destroying the base. Amazingly, Boris survives, but is frozen solid in a cascade of liquid nitrogen. Natalya commandeers a helicopter and rescues Bond. It drops them in a field, where the couple are rescued by Wade {{and a team of}} Marines.|$|E

5|$|The Rosetta Stone was {{originally}} displayed at a slight angle from the horizontal, and rested within a metal <b>cradle</b> {{that was made}} for it, which involved shaving off very small portions of its sides {{to ensure that the}} <b>cradle</b> fitted securely. It originally had no protective covering, and it was found necessary by 1847 to place it in a protective frame, despite the presence of attendants to ensure that it was not touched by visitors. Since 2004, the conserved stone has been on display in a specially built case in the centre of the Egyptian Sculpture Gallery. A replica of the Rosetta Stone is now available in the King's Library of the British Museum, without a case and free to touch, as it would have appeared to early 19th-century visitors.|$|E
