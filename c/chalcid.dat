5|$|One {{family of}} <b>chalcid</b> wasps, the Eucharitidae, has {{specialized}} as parasitoids of ants, most species hosted by one genus of ant. Eucharitids {{are among the}} few parasitoids that {{have been able to}} overcome ants' effective defences against parasitoids.|$|E
5|$|The {{parasitoid}} <b>chalcid</b> wasp Ixodiphagus hookeri {{has been}} investigated for its potential to control tick populations. It lays its eggs into ticks; the hatching wasps kill their hosts.|$|E
5|$|Other {{arthropods}} {{may make}} use of the antlion larva's ability to trap prey. The larva of the Australian horsefly (Scaptia muscula) lives in antlion (for example Myrmeleon pictifrons) pit traps and feeds on the prey caught, and the female <b>chalcid</b> wasp (Lasiochalcidia igiliensis) purposefully allows itself to be trapped so that it can parasitise the antlion larva by ovipositing between its head and thorax.|$|E

5|$|Encarsia formosa {{is a small}} predatory <b>chalcid</b> wasp {{which is}} a {{parasitoid}} of whitefly, a sap-feeding insect which can cause wilting and black sooty moulds in glasshouse vegetable and ornamental crops. It is most effective when dealing with low level infestations, giving protection {{over a long period}} of time. The wasp lays its eggs in young whitefly 'scales', turning them black as the parasite larvae pupate. Gonatocerus ashmeadi (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) has been introduced to control the glassy-winged sharpshooter Homalodisca vitripennis (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) in French Polynesia and has successfully controlled ~95% of the pest density.|$|E
5|$|Parasitoids {{lay their}} eggs on or {{in the body of}} an insect host, which is then used as a food for {{developing}} larvae. The host is ultimately killed. Most insect parasitoids are wasps or flies, and many have a very narrow host range. The most important groups are the ichneumonid wasps, which mainly use caterpillars as hosts; braconid wasps, which attack caterpillars and a wide range of other insects including aphids; <b>chalcid</b> wasps, which parasitize eggs and larvae of many insect species; and tachinid flies, which parasitize a wide range of insects including caterpillars, beetle adults and larvae, and true bugs.|$|E
5|$|In {{some very}} small insects, the venation may be greatly reduced. In Chalcidoidea (<b>Chalcid</b> wasps), for instance, only the subcosta {{and part of}} the radius are present. Conversely, an {{increase}} in venation may occur by the branching of existing veins to produce accessory veins or by the development of additional, intercalary veins between the original ones, as in the wings of Orthoptera (grasshoppers and crickets). Large numbers of cross-veins are present in some insects, and they may form a reticulum as in the wings of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) and {{at the base of the}} forewings of Tettigonioidea and Acridoidea (katydids and grasshoppers respectively).|$|E

40|$|The {{diversity}} and population abundance of parasitoid community (<b>Chalcids,</b> Braconids and Ichneumonids) {{were conducted in}} various habitats in Peninsular Malaysia. The habitat studied were undisturbed forest (Kuala Lompat Wildlife Forest Reserve), disturbed forest (Pasoh Forest Reserve), highly disturbed forest (UKM Permanent Forest Reserve), agricultural (MARDI Fruit Orchard, PORIM Oil Palm and Rubber Estate) and non-forest/agricultural area (bush areas around UKM Campus, Bangi, Selangor). A total of 1420 <b>Chalcids,</b> 1193 Ichneumonids and 1066 Braconids were collected. In an agricultural ecosystem, <b>Chalcids</b> and Braconids {{were found to be}} significantly more abundant compared to highly disturbed forests while in an undisturbed forest Ichneumonids were significantly more abundant than in disturbed forest. The value of Shanon-Weiner diversity index (H�) of these parasitic hymenoptera varies among habitats. Undisturbed forest exhibits a high H� for <b>Chalcids,</b> agricultural area for Braconids and non-forest/agricultural area for Ichneumonids. This indicates that habitat disturbances to some extent do not negate the abundance or diversity of the parasitic community. Disturbance may increase the abundance and the diversity of a certain parasitic insects while it has a reverse effect on others...|$|R
5|$|Butterflies are {{threatened}} {{in their early}} stages by parasitoids and in all stages by predators, diseases and environmental factors. Braconid and other parasitic wasps lay their eggs in lepidopteran eggs or larvae and the wasps' parasitoid larvae devour their hosts, usually pupating inside or outside the desiccated husk. Most wasps are very specific about their host species and some {{have been used as}} biological controls of pest butterflies like the large white butterfly. When the small cabbage white was accidentally introduced to New Zealand, it had no natural enemies. In order to control it, some pupae that had been parasitised by a <b>chalcid</b> wasp were imported, and natural control was thus regained. Some flies lay their eggs on the outside of caterpillars and the newly hatched fly larvae bore their way through the skin and feed in a similar way to the parasitoid wasp larvae. Predators of butterflies include ants, spiders, wasps, and birds.|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 39 insect species, mostly seed <b>chalcids</b> in the genus Megastigmus (Hymenoptera), but also midges (Diptera), {{are listed as}} {{potential}} seed-borne invaders of Chinese conifers. Although the number of native seed insects per conifer genus does not differ between China and other biogeographical regions, there are significantly fewer seed insects associated with each conifer genus in China than potential invaders. The eventual success of the invaders is likely {{to depend on the}} presence of native Chinese conifers that are congeneric with the original host, or on the presence of the original host as an exotic. When a substantial entomofauna is already associated with cones, competition for seed resources may limit the potential impact of invaders because seed insects are usually the last organisms to colonize the cone. A survey of 26 fir species, both native and introduced to Europe, showed that overall seed infestation by five species of exotic <b>chalcids</b> is negatively correlated to levels of damage by native insects, except on the original hosts of the <b>chalcids.</b> Similar patterns are hypothesized for native firs, spruces, Douglas firs, and larches in China. Uncontrolled importation of seeds and nuts of broad-leaved trees could also facilitate the introduction of seed <b>chalcids,</b> seed bruchids, tortricid moths and nut weevils into China. Only six species of seed <b>chalcids</b> are present in China, out of the 72 known to attack broad-leaved seeds over the world...|$|R

A key to female Megastigmus of the Afrotropical Region is provided. Eight new species are described from morphological evidence: M. lanneae Roques & Copeland, M. laventhali Roques & Copeland, M. ozoroae Roques & Copeland, and M. smithi Roques & Copeland in seeds of species of the family Anacardiaceae, M. copelandi Roques & Copeland and M. grewianae Roques & Copeland in seeds of Malvaceae, M. helinae Roques & Copeland in seeds of Rhamnaceae, and M. icipeensis Roques & Copeland for which no host is known. These collections include the first records of Malvaceae and Rhamnaceae as hosts of Megastigmus seed <b>chalcids,</b> which appear to have radiated in Angiosperms much more than previously considered. Analyses of the mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase subunit one - COI) and nuclear DNA (28 S ribosomal region) could be carried out on 8 of the 16 African species of which 5 were newly described ones.

40|$|Throughout {{the southwestern}} U. S., {{riparian}} gallery forests of cottonwood and willow are being invaded by woody exotics, primarily Russian olive and salt cedar. We wondered what effect {{this might have}} on native pollinator populations. Pollinators are indispensable contributors to biodiversity, ecosystem health, and human food production. Recent declines in pollinator abundance and health, such as catastrophic declines in honey bee populations due to Colony Collapse Disorder, has renewed interest in native pollinators and the ecosystem services they provide. Insects were collected from willow, Russian olive and salt cedar throughout April and May of 1997 and 1998 using sweep nets. For each collection day, nets were swept over the target shrubs for a specified number for passes to ensure equal collection effort. Insects were counted and identified to family. Total numbers were adjusted by number of sweep-days. Total insect abundance was greatest for willows (33. 5 insects per sweep-day), followed by Russian olive (18. 0) and salt cedar (6. 8). Willows also had {{the greatest number of}} insect orders and families represented. Of the four primary insect pollinator orders, willow had the greatest numbers of dipterans, hymenopterans, and lepidopterans collected per sweep-day. Russian olive had the greatest number of coleopterans. When ants and <b>chalcids</b> were excluded from the hymenopterans, willows still had the greatest numbers and proportions of hymenopterans caught. It appears that the willow habitat is important to pollinating insects, especially bees. In contrast, saltcedar consistently had the lowest numbers and proportions of all four of the pollinator orders...|$|R
40|$|Larvae of the moth, Hadena bicruris, {{constitute}} {{the most important}} predispersal seed predator on Silene latifolia (Caryophyllaceae). Parasitoids attacking the larvae of this specialist noctuid can potentially decrease the amount of damage to the plant. This paper describes and quantifies the parasitoid complex associated with H. bicruris in the Netherlands, and documents life history characters of its species. Forty-four percent of larval H. bicruris were parasitized by at least 13 species of parasitoids. The most prevalent of these were the braconids Microplitis tristis (22. 9 %) and Bracon variator (4. 9 %) and the ichneumonids Eurylabus tristis (11. 7 %) and Ophion pteridis (3. 4 %). Other species occurring sporadically were: the ichneumonids Scambus brevicornis, S. buolianae, Erigorgus cerinops, and Hyposoter sp.; the tachinids Phryxe vulgaris, P. nemea, Blondelia nigripes and Siphona geniculata; and a Mermithidae sp. The ichneumonid hyperparasitoid Mesochorus lanceolatus was fo! und occasionally in larvae of M. tristis. The hyperparasitoid ichneumonids Gelis agilis, G. hortensis and the <b>chalcids</b> Barvscapus endemus, Pteromalus chrysos and P. vibulenus were found in cocoons of both M. tristis and B. variator. The primary parasitoids M. tristis, E. tristis, {{and to a lesser}} extent, O. pteridis, are believed to be specialized on Hadena. The effect of the parasitoids on herbivory by their host is probably small because the most common parasitoid species are koinobionts that attack large, late instar hosts. Only B. variator and Scambus spp., which are ectoparasitoids, arrest host development immediately upon parasitism, but like the other parasitoids they kill mainly large L 4 or L 5 hosts. The gregarious M. tristis and B. variator produce clutches with a female-biased sex ratio, in contrast to the solitary E. tristis where the sex ratio approaches equality. The ectoparasitoid B. variator produces mostly single-sex clutches, probably avoiding deleterious ef! fects of inbreeding. The clutch size distributions suggest tha! t large clutches of M. tristis and B. variator are probably caused by multiple parasitisms. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 1590 species of {{arthropods}} alien to Europe have already established on the continent, including 226 {{more or less}} cosmopolitan species of uncertain origin (cryptogenic). Th ese alien species are dispersed across 33 taxonomic orders, including crustaceans, chilopods, diplopods, pauropods, Symphyla, mites,arachnids, and insects. However, insects largely dominate, accounting for more than 87 % of the species, far in excess of mites (6. 4 %). Th ree of the insect orders, namely Coleoptera, Hemiptera and Hymenoptera,overall account for nearly 65 % of the total. Th e alien fauna seems to be highly diverse {{with a total of}} 257 families involved, of which 30 have no native representatives. However, just 11 families contribute more than 30 species, mainly aphids, scales and hymenopteran <b>chalcids.</b> For a number of families, the arrival of alien species has signifi cantly modifi ed the composition of the fauna in Europe. Examples are given. Th e number of new records of aliens per year has increased exponentially since the 16 th century, but a signifi cant acceleration was observed since {{the second half of the}} 20 th century, with an average of 19. 6 alien species newly reported per year in Europe between 2000 and 2008. Th is acceleration appears to be mainly related to the arrival of phytophagous species, probably with the plant trade, whereas the contribution of detritivores, parasitoids and predators has decreased. Some taxa have not shown any acceleration in the rate of arrivals. Asia has supplied the largest number of alien arthropods occurring in Europe (26. 7 %), followed by North America (21. 9 %) but large diff erences in the region of origin are apparent between taxa. Once established, most alien species have not spread throughout Europe, at least yet, with 43. 6 % of the species only present in one or two countries, and less than 1 % present in more than 40 countries. Large diff erences also exist between European countries in the total number of alien arthropods recorded per country. Italy (700 species) and France (690 species), followed by Great Britain (533 species), host many more species than other countries. Th e number of alien species per country is signifi cantly correlated with socioeconomic and demographic variables...|$|R
