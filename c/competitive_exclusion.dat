5|$|Along {{with the}} {{blacktip reef shark}} (C. melanopterus) and the whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus), the grey reef shark {{is one of the}} three most common sharks inhabiting Indo-Pacific reefs. They {{actively}} expel most other shark species from favored habitats, even species larger in size. In areas where this species co-exists with the blacktip reef shark, the latter species occupies the shallow flats, while the former stays in deeper water. Areas with a high abundance of grey reef sharks tend to contain few sandbar sharks (C. plumbeus), and vice versa; {{this may be due to}} their similar diets causing <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other than humans, tigers {{appear to}} be the only serious predators of wolves. Wolf and tiger {{interactions}} are well documented in Sikhote-Alin, where tigers depress wolf numbers, either to the point of localized extinction or to such low numbers as to make them a functionally insignificant component of the ecosystem. Wolves appear capable of escaping <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> from tigers only when human persecution decreases tiger numbers. Proven cases of tigers killing wolves are rare and attacks {{appear to be}} competitive rather than predatory in nature, with at least four proven records of tigers killing wolves without consuming them.|$|E
5|$|The bobcat prey base {{overlaps}} {{with that of}} other midsized predators of a similar ecological niche. Research in Maine has shown little evidence of competitive relationships between the bobcat and coyote or red fox; separation distances and territory overlap appeared random among simultaneously monitored animals. However, other studies have found bobcat populations may decrease in areas with high coyote populations, with the more social inclination of the canid giving them a possible competitive advantage. With the Canada lynx, however, the interspecific relationship affects distribution patterns; <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> by the bobcat {{is likely to have}} prevented any further southward expansion of the range of its felid relative.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{problem is}} {{motivated}} by a consideration of two phenotypes of a species in a strongly heterogenous spatial environment. The phenotypes vary in their diffusion rates and interspecific interactions. The aim is to investigate the relative strengths of the diffusion and reaction effects. The problem is thus of competing species type, {{but there are many}} questions which arise which are not covered by standard theory. We investigate, in particular, the stability of the equilibria and the existence of coexistence solutions with emphasis on cases where the spatial variation of the environment becomes large. We discuss briefly the implications of our results for the principle of <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusions</b> and for the question of the evolution of diffusion discussed in Dockery et al. (J. Math. Biol. 37 (1998), 61 – 83) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{establishment}} of cross-protective responses {{and development of}} immunity within a host exert pressure on pathogens through cross-immunity mediated competition between antigenic forms. In this paper, we incorporate age-specificity in the multi-locus epidemic model used to study the pathogen-specific dynamic behaviors for infectious diseases with diverse co-circulating antigenic types. We establish results {{on the existence of}} a unique mild solution, and on the necessary conditions for local stability of the steady-states. In particular, we find that, when the reproductive number R 0 1, we show that there exist additional conditions which determine the stability of different types of endemic equilibria, namely weak and strong endemicity, where the weak endemic equilibria correspond to the existence of principle of <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusions</b> of pathogen-specific clusters, while strong endemicity represents the co-existence of all strains. Using numerical simulations, we also show that weak endemic equilibria yield dynamic features in which only one of the clusters containing discrete strain structures (e. g., of minimally, or non-overlapping antigenic types) persists while others go to extinction. For unique strong endemicity, we observe no strain structure, where antigenic types co-exist or exhibit cyclical strain structure with diverse dynamical behaviors (e. g., (quasi-) periodicity, intermittency, chaos). This demonstrates that pathogenic-specific dynamic features are ubiquitous and shows how cross-immunity between antigenic variants shape the maintenance and evolution of strain structures...|$|R
5|$|In soil, {{microorganisms}} that {{reside in}} the rhizosphere (a zone that includes the root surface and the soil that adheres to the root after gentle shaking) carry out nitrogen fixation, converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds. This serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other bacteria are found as symbionts in humans and other organisms. For example, the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the normal human gut flora of the intestines can contribute to gut immunity, synthesise vitamins, such as folic acid, vitamin K and biotin, convert sugars to lactic acid (see Lactobacillus), as well as fermenting complex undigestible carbohydrates. The presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually through <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion)</b> and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as probiotic dietary supplements.|$|E
5|$|The pigeye shark is {{a largely}} solitary animal, though {{occasionally}} several individuals {{may be found}} at the same location. In the Mozambique Channel, it outnumbers the bull shark on the east side while the opposite is true on the west side, suggesting there may be <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> between these similar species. Parasites documented from the pigeye shark include the myxosporean Kudoa carcharhini, the copepods Pandarus smithii and P. cranchii, and the tapeworms Callitetrarhynchus gracilis, Cathetocephalus sp., Floriceps minacanthus, Heteronybelinia australis, Otobothrium australe, O. crenacolle, and Protogrillotia sp. Young pigeye sharks are potentially vulnerable to predation by larger sharks. The natural mortality for juveniles in Cleveland Bay has been measured at no more than 5% per year; this rate is comparable to that in juvenile bull sharks, and is much lower than in juvenile blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) or lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris).|$|E
5|$|Wolves may {{kill and}} eat red foxes in {{disputes}} over carcasses. In areas in North America where red fox and coyote populations are sympatric, fox ranges {{tend to be}} located outside coyote territories. The principal cause of this separation {{is believed to be}} active avoidance of coyotes by the foxes. Interactions between the two species vary in nature, ranging from active antagonism to indifference. The majority of aggressive encounters are initiated by coyotes, and there are few reports of red foxes acting aggressively toward coyotes except when attacked or when their kits were approached. Foxes and coyotes have sometimes been seen feeding together. In Israel, red foxes share their habitat with golden jackals. Where their ranges meet, the two canids compete due to near identical diets. Foxes ignore jackal scents or tracks in their territories, and avoid close physical proximity with jackals themselves. In areas where jackals become very abundant, the population of foxes decreases significantly, apparently because of <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion.</b>|$|E
40|$|For {{the first}} time, the general trends of large mammal fauna changes in SW Europe during the Middle Pleistocene Revolution (MPR) have been {{compared}} with the coeval vegetation dynamics. Both vegetation and animal communities significantly varied during the MPR, but with different regional timings and modes. A number of new and last appearances are found in mammals, {{so that there is}} no substantial loss of richness. By contrast, since at least 1. 5 Ma no new tree genera are recorded in SW Europe, while many taxa progressively disappeared and their range was occupied by taxa already present in the region. Compared to animals, plant communities show a remarkable persistence, so that in many cases many modern tree populations may be direct descendants of the Early Pleistocene ones in the same region. No such case of long-term persistence since at least the late Early Pleistocene is observed in the faunal record, which underwent a complex history of species turnovers, mainly related to dispersal events, and <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusions,</b> but also originations of endemic species. A comparison among regional trends in SW Europe shows a marked increase in regionalization during the MPR in the faunal record, while only modest differences are found in the vegetation dynamics of N Spain, S France and central Italy. On the whole, disentangling the relationships between vegetation and mammals at time scales of 105 years is a very complex task, due to different patterns of change in relation to climate oscillations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} exclusive contracts between health care providers and insurers in a model where some consumers choose to stay uninsured. In case of a monopoly insurer, exclusion of a provider changes the distribution of consumers who choose not to insure. Although the foreclosed care provider remains active {{in the market for}} the non-insured, we show that exclusion leads to anti-competitive effects on this non-insured market. As a consequence exclusion can raise industry profits, and then occurs in equilibrium. Under competitive insurance markets, the anticompetitive exclusive equilibrium survives. Uninsured consumers, however, are now not better off without exclusion. Competition among insurers raises prices in equilibria without exclusion, {{as a result of a}} horizontal analogue to the double marginalization effect. Instead, under <b>competitive</b> insurance markets <b>exclusion</b> is desirable as long as no provider is excluded by all insurers. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to design a novel mixed {{probiotic}} culture for piglets and to evaluate its beneficial effect on the piglets’ gut health. The possible mechanisms of probiotic activity, such as adhesion, <b>competitive</b> pathogen <b>exclusion</b> and influence on gut microbiota diversity were determined. Mixed probiotic starter culture is composed of three thermophilic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains: Lactobacillus helveticus BGRA 43, Lactobacillus fermentum BGHI 14 and Streptococcus thermophilus BGVLJ 1 - 44. The strains BGVLJ 1 - 44 and BGRA 43 showed good technological properties (fast milk curdling, strong proteolytic activity). In addition, the strain BGVLJ 1 - 44 produces exopolysaccharide (EPS), BGHI 14 is heterofermentative LAB strain with significant immunomodulatory effect, while the strain BGRA 43 showed strong antimicrobial activity against different pathogens and exhibited significantly higher level of adhesion to Caco- 2 cells comparing to other two strains. Both lactobacilli strains BGRA 43 and BGHI 14 (p < 0. 05), as well as probiotic combination (p < 0. 01) significantly reduced the adhesion of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 to Caco- 2 cells, while the strains BGVLJ 1 - 44 (p < 0. 01) and BGRA 43 (p < 0. 05) significantly reduced adhesion of Salmonella 654 / 7 E (veterinary isolate). The results of farm trial revealed that treatment of sows with new fermented dairy probiotic influenced the piglets’ gut colonization with beneficial bacteria and {{reduced the number of}} enterobacteriaceae in litters from some treated sows (no significant due to high variability among animals). Finally, this is the first study reporting that the treatment of sows with probiotic combination resulted in the improved microbiota diversity in neonatal piglets...|$|R
5|$|Biogeographical {{patterns}} and range distributions are explained or predicted through {{knowledge of a}} species' traits and niche requirements. Species have functional traits that are uniquely adapted to the ecological niche. A trait is a measurable property, phenotype, or characteristic of an organism that may influence its survival. Genes {{play an important role}} in the interplay of development and environmental expression of traits. Resident species evolve traits that are fitted to the selection pressures of their local environment. This tends to afford them a competitive advantage and discourages similarly adapted species from having an overlapping geographic range. The <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> principle states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely by living off the same limiting resource; one will always out-compete the other. When similarly adapted species overlap geographically, closer inspection reveals subtle ecological differences in their habitat or dietary requirements. Some models and empirical studies, however, suggest that disturbances can stabilize the co-evolution and shared niche occupancy of similar species inhabiting species-rich communities. The habitat plus the niche is called the ecotope, which is defined as the full range of environmental and biological variables affecting an entire species.|$|E
5|$|In agriculture, fungi may {{be useful}} if they {{actively}} compete for nutrients and space with pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria or other fungi via the <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> principle, or if they are parasites of these pathogens. For example, certain species {{may be used to}} eliminate or suppress the growth of harmful plant pathogens, such as insects, mites, weeds, nematodes, and other fungi that cause diseases of important crop plants. This has generated strong interest in practical applications that use these fungi in the biological control of these agricultural pests. Entomopathogenic fungi can be used as biopesticides, as they actively kill insects. Examples that have been used as biological insecticides are Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium spp, Hirsutella spp, Paecilomyces (Isaria) spp, and Lecanicillium lecanii. Endophytic fungi of grasses of the genus Neotyphodium, such as N. coenophialum, produce alkaloids that are toxic to a range of invertebrate and vertebrate herbivores. These alkaloids protect grass plants from herbivory, but several endophyte alkaloids can poison grazing animals, such as cattle and sheep. Infecting cultivars of pasture or forage grasses with Neotyphodium endophytes is one approach being used in grass breeding programs; the fungal strains are selected for producing only alkaloids that increase resistance to herbivores such as insects, while being non-toxic to livestock.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, the Siberian tiger was on {{the brink}} of {{extinction}} with only about 40 animals remaining in the wild in Russia. As a result, anti-poaching controls were put in place by the Soviet Union and a network of protected zones (zapovedniks) were instituted, leading to a rise in the population to several hundred. Poaching again became a problem in the 1990s, when the economy of Russia collapsed. The major obstacle in preserving the species is the enormous territory individual tigers require (up to 450km2 needed by a single female and more for a single male). Current conservation efforts are led by local governments and NGO's in concert with international organisations, such as the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Wildlife Conservation Society. The <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> of wolves by tigers has been used by Russian conservationists to convince hunters to tolerate the big cats. Tigers have less impact on ungulate populations than do wolves, and are effective in controlling the latter's numbers. In 2005, there were thought to be about 360 animals in Russia, though these exhibited little genetic diversity. However, in a decade later, the Siberian tiger census was estimated from 480 to 540 individuals.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} effects of the United States Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) on imports from beneficiary Less Developed Countries (LDCs) from three perspectives. Three separate essays are written. All are ex post analyses. The first describes {{the effects of}} the U. S. GSP according to (a variant of) the shift-share approach. An attempt is made to measure the growth in U. S. imports from the beneficiaries between two points in time. Quantifiable causes of this growth are subtracted from the overall growth. The residual then is attributed to the GSP effect. ^ The second essay explains changes in market shares of individual beneficiaries of the U. S. preference scheme. A cross-section statistical analysis is used to explain changes in market shares. The effect of a change (increase) in tariff caused by U. S. <b>competitive</b> need <b>exclusion</b> (CNE) on beneficiaries 2 ̆ 7 market shares is especially considered. Other factors which influence the beneficiaries 2 ̆ 7 market shares are also considered. The latter variables may provide a basis for the 2 ̆ 2 graduation 2 ̆ 2 of LDCs from the scheme. Finally, the third essay makes a gravity model estimate of {{the effects of the}} U. S. scheme of preferences. A cross-sectional statistical analysis across countries is used to explain bilateral trade flows between the U. S. and its beneficiaries, as well as other trade partners. In an attempt to estimate the effect of the U. S. GSP scheme on the beneficiaries, ad valorem tariff rates and GSP dummy variables are included in the model developed. The tariff variable is used to indicate the trade creation effect of the GSP, while the GSP dummy variable approximates the trade diversion effect of the GSP. ...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1970 s, {{more and}} more mathematicians {{have been trying to}} propose {{reasonable}} models for the growth of species in all kinds of environments and for the spread of epidemic diseases, and to understand the long-term behavior of their modelling systems. This thesis, consisting of five chapters, mainly deals with the dynamics of population and epidemic models represented by some time-delayed ordinary and partial differential equations, and reaction-diffusion systems. [...] In Chapter 1, we present some basic concepts and theorems, which involve the theories of monotone dynamics, uniform persistence, essential spectrum of linear operators, asymptotic speeds of spread and minimal traveling wave speed. [...] Based on some specific competitive models, we formulate in Chapter 2 a class of asymptotically periodic delay differential equations, which models multi-species competition, and investigate the global dynamics of the model. More precisely, we established the sufficient conditions for <b>competitive</b> coexistence, <b>exclusion</b> and uniform persistence via theories of competitive systems on Banach spaces, uniform persistence, periodic and asymptotically periodic semiflows. [...] Chapter 3 focuses on a nonlocal reaction-diffusion equation modelling the growth of a single species. For this model, we obtain a threshold dynamics and the global attractivity of a positive steady state. We also discuss the effects of spatial dispersal and maturation period on the evolutionary behavior in two specific cases. Our numerical investigation seems to suggest that the model admits a unique positive steady state even without monotonicity conditions. [...] In Chapter 4, we consider an epidemic model represented by a reaction-diffusion equation coupled with an ordinary differential equation, which is proposed by Capasso et al. Here, the existence, uniqueness (up to translation) and global exponential stability with phase shift of bistable traveling waves are studied by phase plane techniques, monotone semiflow approaches and a detailed spectrum analysis. [...] In Chapter 5, the asymptotic speeds of spread for solutions and traveling wave solutions to the integral version of the epidemic model in Chapter 4 are investigated. Our results show that the minimal wave speed for monotone traveling waves coincides with the asymptotic speed of spread for solutions with initial functions having compact supports. Some numerical simulations are also provided...|$|R
40|$|Probiotic L. reuteri has {{potential}} to produce antimicrobial compounds and secrete immunosuppressive factors. These metabolic attributes could benefit the human host by providing colonization resistance (<b>competitive</b> and metabolic <b>exclusion)</b> against enteropathogens and mitigating inflammation. As metabolically active cells are fundamental to such probiotic properties, synbiotic approaches that supply L. reuteri with a source(s) of carbon, energy, and/or external electron acceptor for cell {{growth in the}} gut environment could therefore prompt the probiotic to engage in beneficial activities. In this study, the efficacy of GOS and/or rhamnose-based synbiotic approaches in promoting colonization persistence and metabolic activity of L. reuteri was evaluated. A single blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled human trial revealed that daily administration of the L. reuteri DSM 17938 (5 x 108 cells) /GOS (1 g) /rhamnose (1 g) synbiotic combination significantly stimulated metabolic activity of the probiotic strain in the human gut. This positive outcome presumably results from the ability of L. reuteri to metabolize GOS as a carbon and energy source, while utilizing rhamnose as an external electron acceptor for redox balance. In contrast, neither GOS (2 g) nor rhamnose (2 g) alone could exert such stimulatory effect. In addition, after the synbiotic administration was terminated, the extended supplementation of the carbohydrates without L. reuteri {{did not appear to}} improve the persistence of the probiotic in the gut. ^ Genetic characterization of GOS metabolic machinery disclosed that GOS metabolism in L. reuteri is inducible and is under carbon catabolite repression (CCR). The metabolic system relies on LacS permease and a second transporter to import diverse GOS species into the cytosol. Then, two β-galactosidases, LacA and LacLM, sequentially break down GOS oligosaccharides as well as concertedly hydrolyze GOS disaccharides. The system is regulated by repressor protein LacR and fully activated only in the presence of inducer lactose {{and in the absence of}} glucose (i. e., a preferred carbon source). Furthermore, a growth advantage only the wild type strain, but not the GOS metabolic gene-deficient mutant, gained in the GOS-enriched murine gut suggests that the GOS metabolic system be operational in the gut environment. ...|$|R

25|$|Although local {{extinction}} {{of one or}} more competitors has been less documented than niche separation or <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion,</b> it does occur.

Work on resource partitioning and the structuring of bird communities through competition were made by Robert MacArthur. Patterns of biodiversity also became a topic of interest.

25|$|The {{segregation}} of black bear and grizzly bear populations is possibly due to <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion.</b> In certain areas, grizzly bears outcompete black bears {{for the same}} resources. For example, many Pacific coastal islands off British Columbia and Alaska support either the black bear or the grizzly, but rarely both. In regions where both species coexist, they are divided by landscape gradients such as age of forest, elevation and openness of land. Grizzly bears tend to favor old forests with high productivity, higher elevations and more open habitats compared with black bears.|$|E
25|$|Biological invasions are {{composed}} of exotic biota that enter a landscape and replace species with which they share similarities in structure and ecological function. Because they multiply and grow quickly, invasive species can eliminate or greatly reduce existing flora and fauna by various mechanisms, such as direct <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion.</b> Invasive species typically spread {{at a faster rate}} when they have no natural predators or when they fill an empty niche. These invasions often occur in a historical context and are classified as a type of human-mediated disturbance called human-mediated invasions.|$|E
25|$|Character {{displacement}} is {{the phenomenon}} where differences among similar species whose distributions overlap geographically are accentuated in regions where the species co-occur, but are minimized or lost where the species’ distributions do not overlap. This pattern results from evolutionary change driven by biological competition among species {{for a limited}} resource (e.g. food). The rationale for character displacement stems from the <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> principle, also called Gause's Law, which contends that to coexist in a stable environment two competing species must differ in their respective ecological niche; without differentiation, one species will eliminate or exclude the other through competition.|$|E
25|$|A {{well-documented}} {{example of}} <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> was observed to occur between Dolly Varden charr (Trout)(Salvelinus malma) and white spotted char (Trout)(S. leucomaenis) in Japan. Both {{of these species}} were morphologically similar but the former species was found primarily at higher elevations than the latter. Although there was a zone of overlap, each species excluded the other from its dominant region by becoming better adapted to its habitat over time. In some such cases, each species gets displaced into an exclusive segment of the original habitat. Because each species suffers from competition, natural selection favors the avoidance of competition in such a way.|$|E
25|$|The only mammals {{native to}} the region are the common Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans), and the goat, but even these are tricky. Indeed, the rat {{would seem to have}} been {{introduced}} by native seafarers numerous centuries before Cook found Kiritimati in 1777, and the goat is extinct since 14 January 2004. Black rats (Rattus rattus) were present at some time, perhaps introduced by 19th century sailors or during the nuclear tests. They {{have not been able to}} gain a foothold between predation by cats and <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> by Polynesian rats, and no black rat population is found on Kiritimati today.|$|E
25|$|These models {{showed that}} generalist predators can {{undermine}} {{the benefits of}} the storage effect that from competition. This occurs because generalist predators depress population levels by eating individuals. When this happens, there are fewer individuals competing for resources. As a result, relatively abundant species are less constrained by competition for resource in favorable years (i.e., the covariance between environment and competition is weakened), and therefore the storage effect from competition is weakened. This conclusion follows the general trend that the introduction of a generalist predator will often weaken other competition-based coexistence mechanisms, and which result in <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Niche {{differentiation}} is {{a process}} by which <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> leads to differences in resource use. In the previous example, niche differentiation resulted in spatial displacement. In other cases it may result in other changes that also avoid competition. If competition avoidance is achievable, each species will occupy an edge of the niche and will become more specialized to that area thus minimizing competition. This phenomenon often results in the separation of species over time as they become more specialized to their edge of the niche, called niche differentiation. The species {{do not have to}} be in separate habitats however to avoid niche overlap. Some species adapt regionally to utilizing different resources than they ordinarily would in order to avoid competition.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, interspecific {{competition has}} {{great impact on}} community composition and structure. Niche separation of species, local extinction and <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> are {{only some of the}} possible effects. In addition to these, interspecific competition can be the source of a cascade of effects that build on each other. An example of such an effect is the introduction of an invasive species to the United States, purple-loosestrife. This plant when introduced to wetland communities often outcompetes much of the native flora and decreases species richness, food and shelter to many other species at higher trophic levels. In this way, one species can influence the populations of many other species as well as through a myriad of other interactions. Because of the complicated web of interactions that make up every ecosystem and habitat, the results of interspecific competition are complex and site-specific.|$|E
25|$|Tigers depress wolves' numbers, {{either to}} the point of {{localized}} extinction or to such low numbers as to make them a functionally insignificant component of the ecosystem. Wolves appear capable of escaping <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> from tigers only when human pressure decreases tiger numbers. In areas where wolves and tigers share ranges, the two species typically display a great deal of dietary overlap, resulting in intense competition. Wolf and tiger interactions are well documented in Sikhote-Alin, where until the beginning of the 20th century, very few wolves were sighted. Wolf numbers may have increased in the region after tigers were largely eliminated during the Russian colonization in the late 19th century and early 20th century. This is corroborated by native inhabitants of the region claiming that they had no memory of wolves inhabiting Sikhote-Alin until the 1930s, when tiger numbers decreased. Today, wolves are considered scarce in tiger habitat, being found in scattered pockets, and usually seen travelling as loners or in small groups. First hand accounts on interactions between the two species indicate that tigers occasionally chase wolves from their kills, while wolves will scavenge from tiger kills. Tigers are not known to prey on wolves, though there are four records of tigers killing wolves without consuming them. Tigers recently released are also said to hunt wolves.|$|E

[...] The restricted range of this arboreal primate, particularly {{during a time when}} much of the island was blanketed in forest, might have been due to habitat specificity, <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion,</b> or some other unknown factor.

500|$|The role of {{extinction}} in evolution {{is not very}} well understood and may depend on which type {{of extinction}} is considered. The causes of the continuous [...] "low-level" [...] extinction events, which form the majority of extinctions, {{may be the result}} of competition between species for limited resources (the <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> principle). If one species can out-compete another, this could produce species selection, with the fitter species surviving and the other species being driven to extinction. The intermittent mass extinctions are also important, but instead of acting as a selective force, they drastically reduce diversity in a nonspecific manner and promote bursts of rapid evolution and speciation in survivors.|$|E
2500|$|Another way {{by which}} niche {{differentiation}} can arise is via the previous elimination of species without realized niches. [...] This asserts {{that at some}} point in the past, several species inhabited an area, and all of these species had overlapping fundamental niches. [...] However, through <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion,</b> the less competitive species were eliminated, leaving only the species that were able to coexist (i.e. the most competitive species whose realized niches did not overlap). [...] Again, this process does not include any evolutionary change of individual species, but it is merely the product of the <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> principle. [...] Also, because no species is out-competing any other species in the final community, the presence of niche differentiation will be difficult or impossible to detect.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{competing}} {{species have}} been shown to coexist on the same resource with no observable evidence of niche differentiation and in “violation” of the <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> principle. [...] One instance is in a group of hispine beetle species (Strong 1982). [...] These beetle species, which eat the same food and occupy the same habitat, coexist without any evidence of segregation or exclusion. [...] The beetles show no aggression either intra- or inter-specifically. [...] Coexistence may be possible through a combination of non-limiting food and habitat resources and high rates of predation and parasitism, though this has not been demonstrated.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>competitive</b> <b>exclusion</b> principle, {{also called}} [...] "Gause's law" [...] which arose from {{mathematical}} analysis and simple competition models states that two species {{that use the}} same limiting resource {{in the same way}} in the same space and time cannot coexist and must diverge from each other over time in order for the two species to coexist. One species will often exhibit an advantage in resource use. This superior competitor will out-compete the other with more efficient use of the limiting resource. As a result, the inferior competitor will suffer a decline in population over time. It will be excluded from the area and replaced by the superior competitor.|$|E
