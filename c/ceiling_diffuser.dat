The light guides present modern ways of illumination of internal windowless parts of buildings. Their function {{is based on the}} principle of light transport from outdoor to distant indoor places due to multi-reflections on their high reflective internal surfaces. This study describes a method for evaluation of internal illumination from light guides on the basis of determined luminance of the light guide <b>ceiling</b> <b>diffuser.</b> A calculation module was developed for the evaluation of indoor illuminance on the basis of data from monitoring of the <b>ceiling</b> <b>diffuser</b> luminance. The described method presents a design tool for an operative estimation of indoor daylighting in rooms illuminated by tubular light guides...|$|E
40|$|The {{requirements}} of laboratory facilities differ dramatically {{from those of}} other buildings. As we expand our biocontainment needs to Biosafety Levels (BSL) - 2,- 3, and- 4, a clear need exists for an air quality and thermal comfort initiative targeting these facilities. The thermal comfort of occupants in laboratories can be controlled by the choice of ventilation strategy. Added benefits are the realization of a significant energy savings and improved indoor air quality. This study employs an advanced numerical simulation and empirical validation to assess the performance of active chilled beams in a general laboratory layout having some equipment intensive areas. The study examines the removal effectiveness of gases and airborne particles in such a system. Chilled beam performance is also compared to a <b>ceiling</b> <b>diffuser</b> system with and without cooling panels. The {{results of this study}} show that chilled beams improve thermal comfort and can be operated at reduced Air Changes per Hour (ACH) while maintaining a comfortable environment in occupied zones expressed as the Predicted Percentage Dissatisfied (PPD). To obtain a similar level of thermal comfort, a higher ACH is required in a <b>ceiling</b> <b>diffuser</b> system with cooling panels and bench exhausts. The chilled beam system also improves the removal effectiveness of gases or airborne particles because of the inherent better mixing in the room compared with the use of ceiling diffusers. In the cases studied, chilled beams have an insignificant effect on the fume hood containment. As satisfactory thermal comfort and air quality was achieved at a lower flow rate when compared with an all-air <b>ceiling</b> <b>diffuser</b> system, a savings of around 22 % is estimated in annual energy costs for cooling and ventilating a typical lab in the Washington, DC area. The methodology and results of this study may be applied to further research for other laboratory types, or climatic conditions than those proposed in this study...|$|E

The main {{objectives of the}} research were (1) to study the flow characteristics of isothermal jets issuing from vortex diffusers, (2) to compare the vortex diffuser`s performance {{with that of a}} conventional diffuser, and (3) to prepare a report that disseminates the results to the designers of ventilation and air-conditioning systems. The researchers considered three diffusers: a conventional round <b>ceiling</b> <b>diffuser</b> and two different styles of vortex diffusers.

A detailed analysis {{has been presented}} using plots of streamlines, isotherms, heat-lines and variation of the average Nusselt number with changes in buoyancy ratio. The {{results indicate that the}} location of outlet plays {{a significant role in the}} targeted occupied region and it can be used for different applications of <b>ceiling</b> <b>diffusers.</b> The predicted performance of fluid flow can be applied in different medical clean room applications. The airflow analysis indicates that for a single <b>ceiling</b> air <b>diffuser,</b> it is advantageous to adopt a variation in the inclination angle at inlet to achieve maximum air distribution profiles. The combinations of inlet and outlet position reduce the short-circuiting of supply air, providing additional uniform temperatures and room airflow in the occupied zone...|$|R

Diffusers that uses jet nozzles are called jet diffuser {{where it will be}} arranged in the side wall areas in order to distribute air.

40|$|Air supply {{diffusers}} used in {{air-conditioning systems}} can be classified as <b>ceiling</b> <b>diffusers,</b> side-wall diffusers, floor diffusers, jet nozzles, and low velocity displacement diffusers. Fixed or adjustable slats are usually used to control airflow directions. Recently, swirling vanes are used in floor diffusers to create swirling outflow jet, so that more rapid mixing with ambient air can be achieved. In this paper we used the latest CFD technique to investigate the airflow pattern and the impact on thermal comfort in the near nozzle region of a floor-level swirl-type diffuser. The preliminary simulation results indicate that re-circulation region in the near nozzle can only be realistically predicted by including the swirling devices in the calculation domain. The results will be further validated with experiments, and the method {{is expected to be}} used to help optimize diffuser designs...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) study for thermal comfort in a hospital operating room. The research aims to analyze indoor thermal comfort using the predicted mean vote (PMV) model which has been presented by ISO 7730. The room model includes a patient lying on an operating table with a surgical staff of six members standing around under surgical lights. The airflow is supplied to the room from the <b>ceiling</b> <b>diffuser</b> and exhausted through low-level side walls on both sides. Solutions of distribution of airflow velocity, temperature, relative humidity and so on are presented and discussed. The PMV and PPD are calculated for assessing thermal comfort based on TCM model. The simulation {{results show that the}} values of PMV and PPD in some parts of human body are not within the standard acceptable range defined by ISO, but its comfortableness satisfies China national standard GB/T 18049 request.

40|$|The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has {{recommended}} {{the use of}} downward ventilation systems in isolation rooms {{to reduce the risk}} of cross-infection from airborne transmissible diseases. The expected airflow pattern of a downward ventilation design would supply cooler and slightly heavier clean air from a <b>ceiling</b> <b>diffuser</b> to push down contaminants, which would then be removed via outlets at floor level. A "laminar" (strictly speaking, unidirectional) flow is expected to be produced to avoid flow mixing and thus reduce cross-infection risk. Experiments were carried out in a full-scale experimental hospital ward with a downward ventilation system to investigate the possibility of applying downward ventilation in a general hospital ward. Two life-sized breathing thermal manikins were used to simulate a source patient and a receiving patient. Computation fluid dynamics was also used to investigate the airflow pattern and pollutant dispersion in the test ward. Based on both experimental and numerical results, the laminar airflow pattern was shown to be impossible to achieve due to turbulent flow mixing and flow entrainment into the supply air stream. The thermal plumes produced above people were found to induce flow mixing. We also studied the effects of the locations of the supply and extraction openings on both the flow pattern and pollutant exposure level in the occupied zone. A number of practical recommendations are suggested. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Building air {{distribution}} terminal system designers and system installers require accurate quantitative {{information on the}} performance of the installed system to achieve optimum efficiency and levels of human comfort. This research project, covered in three papers, establishes the diffuser baseline performance and then determines the field installation adjustment values. This paper documents the practical ideal air output performance of six types of <b>ceiling</b> <b>diffusers,</b> each with three different inlet sizes at three different inlet velocities, according to ASHRAE Standard 70 - 2006 (ASHRAE 2006).

This paper covers the design of an optimum flow diffuser inlet supply plenum and the acquisition of a baseline set of data covering the diffusers. Four test parameters, three for the flow equalization device and one for plenum air supply inlet configuration, were varied. To minimize airflow velocity variation across a wide spectrum of user conditions, testing was completed across two user selectable conditions: inlet diameter and volume flow rate. Variation achieved was a standard deviation of 2. 6 %. The plenum was then used to determine the experimental data, throw, sound power, and pressure differential across each diffuser for each test condition. These results were used as a baseline for comparison against results from typical field installation conditions...|$|R

Air velocity measurements showed good performance of duct and <b>ceiling</b> <b>diffusers</b> which provided maximum velocities less than 0. 2 m/s {{and can be}} highly recommended for classrooms. The wall diffusers were clearly not suitable for classrooms due to high velocities up to 0. 43 m/s.

Room temperature measurement results showed a typical problem with temperature control as {{at the end of}} the heating season the temperatures up to 25 °C were measured.

40|$|International audienceMixing {{ventilation}} {{is commonly}} used to control thermal comfort in a room {{by means of a}}ir jets. In summer conditions, the occupants often complain of thermal discomfort and draft problems, because the cooling airflow penetrates the occupied zone under buoyancy force effect, with high speeds and low temperatures. To reduce these problems, the jet trajectory could be maintained away from the occupant, by means of a radial jet attached to the ceiling. One great limitation of most radial ceiling diffusers is their inability to correctly mix the jet to the ambient air, {{and the use of the}} Coanda effect may worsen this issue because it reduces jet induction. The design of the diffuser itself to enhance the jet mixing with the ambient air by means of inserted lobes was recently proposed in an European patent. In this paper, an experimental investigation is made on airflow pattern and thermal comfort generated in a full scale model room by a <b>ceiling</b> <b>diffuser,</b> and its performance is compared with the same diffuser equipped with inserted lobes. The jet flow from the diffuser and its interaction with a heated manikin simulating an occupant were analyzed with the whole-field PIV technique. Thermal dissatisfaction and draft effect were analyzed based on traditional pointwise measuring probes and the standards ISO 7730 and ASHRAE 55. It is revealed that thermal discomfort and draft sensation were substantially reduced using inserted lobes, without significant changes of pressure drop and sound pressure levels. © 2016 Elsevier Lt...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- In {{this paper}} the {{experimental}} {{results of the}} measurements obtained testing two different configurations of air diffusion inside a simulated office room are reported. The overall aim {{of the work is}} to visualise the air velocity and temperature distributions in different sections of the climatised volume to understand if the right thermal comfort condition of the occupants are established. To reach the goal the research group of the Dipartimento di Energetica dell’Università di Ancona (D. E. A.), has designed and realised a series of laboratory devices and monitoring systems to test several air conditioning components and air diffusion configurations. In this way is possible to verify the right position of inlet and outlet diffusers, the flow rate and inlet air temperature to establish an uniform distribution of the air velocity. For this purpose vertical grills, round <b>ceiling</b> <b>diffusers</b> and floor linear diffusers are installedon the sides of a controlled room, where walls, floor and ceiling are modular to have whatever positions for the inlet and outlet diffusers. To record in steady state the values of the temperature and the air velocity on different vertical planes cutting the climatised volume an automated apparatus, designed and built with the component derived from the robotic technologies, has been utilised.

5000|$|In air conditioning, the Coandă {{effect is}} {{exploited}} {{to increase the}} throw of a <b>ceiling</b> mounted <b>diffuser.</b> Because the Coandă effect causes air discharged from the diffuser to [...] "stick" [...] to the ceiling, it travels farther before dropping for the same discharge velocity than it would if the diffuser was mounted in free air, without the neighbouring ceiling. Lower discharge velocity means lower noise levels and, {{in the case of}} variable air volume (VAV) air conditioning systems, permits greater turndown ratios. Linear diffusers and slot diffusers that present a greater length of contact with the ceiling exhibit a greater Coandă effect.|$|R

40|$|Vertical display {{cabinets}} are {{widespread in}} food stores, {{because they have}} a large display area and an ease access for customers. Recently, open cabinets has been replaced with closed ones in order to reduce energy consumptions for refrigeration. However, the presence of the glass doors can have an effect on product visibility because of mist formation on the glass, particularly for low temperature display cabinets. This effect appears when the temperature at the external surface of the glass falls below the ambient dew temperature, which is a quite common situation in humid climate in the mid-season, when neither indoor air heating nor cooling is performed. Today the mist formation is prevented increasing the surface temperature at external side of the glass doors by means of electrical resistances embedded in the doors frame. The glass door surface temperature can be raised enhancing the heat transfer coefficient driving the supply air towards the display cabinet doors. This paper investigates the behaviour of different air <b>ceiling</b> <b>diffusers</b> (vortex diffusers and linear diffusers) {{in order to reduce the}} risk of mist formation and the energy consumption of electrical resistances. Initially, 3 D numerical simulations of isothermal airflow field has been performed and, later, summer and winter conditions were considered.

40|$|In North America, the {{ventilation}} system in indoor environments {{have been almost}} exclusively {{associated with the use}} of conventional ceiling air distribution systems, where the air is moved via ducts through <b>ceiling</b> <b>diffusers.</b> However, in the past years there has been a growing interest in the application of localized ventilation systems for which numerous studies have been conducted looking at different aspects such as enhanced thermal comfort, improved indoor air quality and lower energy consumption. It has also been determined that a typical localized ventilation system creates a non-uniform thermal environment, which might cause thermal discomfort due to excessive vertical temperature difference, draft, and asymmetric thermal conditions. As an alternative to the experimental measurments, the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods have been used to predict the airflow field around the occupant. The correct prediction of the flow field is dependent upon the proper modeling of the occupant body since the actual shape of human body is complicated and its heat distribution is known to be non-uniform. However, past CFD studies on the subject were mainly performed by modeling the occupant as a block with uniform heat distribution, in order to simplify the problem and decrease the computational cost.

40|$|The {{treatment}} of convective heat transfer at internal building surfaces {{has a significant}} impact on the simulation of heat and air flow. Accurate approaches for the range of flow regimes experi-enced within buildings (buoyant flow adjacent to walls, buoyant plumes rising from radiators, fan-driven flows, etc.) are required, as is the ability to select an appropriate method for the case at hand and to adapt modelling to changes in the flow. A new approach—drawing upon previously pub-lished methods—has been developed for modelling mixed convection within mechanically ventilated rooms. It is applicable for rooms ventilated with <b>ceiling</b> mounted <b>diffusers</b> and is appropriate for both heating and cooling. ESP-r simulations per-formed with the mixed flow model indicate that the prediction of heating and cooling loads is highly sensitive to the {{treatment of}} surface convection and that significant errors can result if an inappropriate model is employed.

50|$|Mixing systems {{generally}} {{supply air}} {{such that the}} supply air mixes with the room air so that the mixed air is at the room design temperature and humidity. In cooling mode, the cool supply air, typically around 55 °F (13 °C) (saturated) at design conditions, exits an outlet at high velocity. The high velocity supply air stream causes turbulence causing the room air to mix with the supply air. Because the entire room is near-fully mixed, temperature variations are small while the contaminant concentration is fairly uniform throughout the entire room. Diffusers are normally used as the air outlets to create the high velocity supply air stream. Most often, the air outlets and inlets are placed in the <b>ceiling.</b> Supply <b>diffusers</b> in the <b>ceiling</b> are fed by fan coil units in the ceiling void or by air handling units in a remote plant room. The fan coil or handling unit take in return air from the ceiling void and mix this with fresh air and cool, or heat it, as required to achieve the room design conditions.

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on {{findings}} resulting from ASHRAE Research Project RP- 1416. Convection at interior surfaces significantly affects the overall heat transfer in office buildings with large glazing areas. While {{a large number of}} these office buildings utilize ceiling slot dif-fusers at the glazed building perimeter, convection correlations specific to these diffusers have not yet been investigated. This paper describes convection correlations developed for <b>ceiling</b> slot <b>diffusers</b> and examines the effect of temperature, window geometry, and diffuser jet momen-tum on these correlations. The paper also examines the effect of venetian blinds on the overall correlations. The convective heat transfer coefficients are measured in both heating and cooling conditions. Overall, this paper represents the outcome of over 100 individual full-scale experi-ments. The results show that forced convection is dominant {{for a wide range of}} airflow rates. Correlations are developed as a function of the specific volumetric flow rate of supply air. The temperature of the supply air is also utilized as the reference temperature in convection calcula-tions. The correlations are found to rely primarily on window position and the presence of blinds. The correlations are independent of the temperature difference between surface and sup-ply, diffuser position, and diffuser jet momentum. The paper also quantifies the difference between the convection correlations developed for heated and cooled environments. Finally, uti-lizing energy modeling to quantify the difference between the new correlations and those previ-ously used, it is found that former convection coefficients underestimate the energy demand. In the modeled building, utilizing the newly developed correlations for forced convection increased the peak cooling load by 24 % and the overall energy consumption by 4 % over the baseline that had natural convection with constant coefficients at window surfaces...|$|R
