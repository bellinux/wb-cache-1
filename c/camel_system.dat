The most important principle of bioremediation is that microorganisms (mainly bacteria) {{can be used to}} destroy hazardous contaminants or transform them into a less harmful form.

The CABOTO objective concerns the design and implementation of a parallel simulator for the bioremediation of contaminated soils by using models based on the cellular automata (CA) theory.

The former represented a peri-urban <b>camel</b> production <b>system,</b> where milking herds are reared within the vicinity of Isiolo town with a lot of market integration through sale of camel stock and camel milk. The latter area represents traditional camel production in a pastoral setting, where pastoralists rear their camels in the rangelands for subsistence and they move with their herds in search of pasture, water and mineral licks.|$|R

[2003]). In fact, across arid and semi-arid areas of Africa, camel husbandry represents a viable productive pathway and has progressively become commoditized through marketing of camels and camel products in peri-urban husbandry systems. The transformation of pastoral nomads into petty commodity or capitalist producers, and of subsistence pastoral production into commodity production, has been occurring throughout Africa to various degrees and at various scales with increasing integration of camel milk and meat markets at regional and national scales (Herren [1992]; Nori et al. [2006]).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} problem of {{high-level}} querying of multimedia data by imposing arbitrary domain-specific constraints among multimedia objects. We argue that the current structured query model, and the query-by-content model, are insufficient for many important applications, and we propose an alternative query framework that unifies and extends the previous two models. The proposed framework {{is based on the}} querying-by-concept paradigm, where the query is expressed simply in terms of concepts, regardless of the complexity of the underlying multimedia search engines. The query-by-concept paradigm was previously illustrated by the <b>CAMEL</b> <b>system.</b> The present paper builds upon and extends that work by adding arbitrary constraints and multiple levels of hierarchy in the concept representation model. We consider queries simply as descriptions of virtual data sets, and that allows us to use the same unifying concept representation for query specification, as well as for data annotation purposes. We also identify some key issues and challenges presented by the new framework, and we outline possible approaches for overcoming them. In particular, we study the problems of concept representation, extraction, refinement, storage, and matching.

30|$|The {{intensification}} of camel production among refugees {{does not occur}} through breeding {{or the use of}} tools or machines to substitute human labour (and thus reduce the costs of production). Rather, intensification, as understood here and as described for peri-urban <b>camel</b> <b>systems</b> {{in other parts of the}} world (Faye et al. [2003]), refers to the substitution of extensive land use (grazing on wild forage plants) with intensive input use - essentially, camels are confined in a smaller spaces and live from purchased fodder, trucked in water supplies and modern veterinary medicines. Different authors have noted a more general tendency in Saharan camel husbandry towards reduced mobility and grazing intake and increased consumption of fodder and supplementary feeds (Michel et al. [1997]; Faye et al. [2003]). Throughout the last century or so, the use of supplementary livestock feeds has increased worldwide in part as a result of the increasing availability of cheap agro-industrial by-products and mechanized transport systems capable of delivering them in bulk (Blench [2001]).|$|R

This project falls {{within the framework of the}} promotion of the innovating <b>camel</b> <b>systems</b> and of the local camel value chains for a sustainable management of the Saharan territories. The socio-economic survey was conducted in four regions of southeast Tunisia (Medenine, Tataouine, Gabes and Kebeli). A total of 147 households were interviewed on the management, significance and constraints associated to the camel production in the area using a field diagnostic survey. According to the camel breeders' responses, the family living status of the camel herders has based on camels and small ruminant's livestock activities. Most of the camel herders were keeping areas occupied by natural vegetation which can provide a feed source for animals. For the most part of the areas have an average annual rainfall below 300 mm and either a Saharan or an arid Mediterranean bioclimate. Although the land ownership status may change, the rangelands are mostly subject to the system known as collective ownership. Major source of income of the camel herders at all zones were sale of milk and meat, sale of animals and crop cultivation. Majority of the herders kept their camels in open air system and take their camels for grazing from morning till evening at all the zones. But, because of rangelands degradation the trend of supplementation becoming more and more adopted. Camels play an important role in the socio-economics of the people in this area.

30|$|Pastoralism {{is a way}} of life {{based on}} raising livestock, {{particularly}} cattle, small ruminants, and <b>camels.</b> Pastoral <b>systems</b> are important to many people in Africa’s vast arid and semi-arid areas (African Union 2010) where the availability of rainfall is unpredictable and erratic. For example, in Ethiopia, arid and semi-arid areas account for 60 % of the total available land and pastoralism is the sole means of living for about 10 % of the total population (Tegegne et al. 1999; Hogg 1997). More than one million people derive their living from pastoralism in the Borana region in Ethiopia and Kenya, one of the most famous examples of sustained pastoralism in the world (Helland 2001). However, even such strongly established systems are vulnerable to economic, political, demographic, and environmental factors that force locals to search for additional ways to earn an income as they watch historical pastoralist traditions fade over time (Fratkin 2001).|$|R
