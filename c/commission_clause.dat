5000|$|Empress of Japan was {{refitted}} as an Armed merchantman {{during the}} Great War; and consequently, she lost the elegant white gleam associated with luxury cruise ships. The agreement of commission between Canadian Pacific Railway, the Canadian Federal Government and the British Parliament included a clause which stated {{that in the}} event of war, Empress of Japan would be re-fitted to meet Admiralty requirements. In 1914, two days before Empress of Japan arrived in Yokohama on a routine trip to Asia, World War I broke out in Europe. His Majesty's Admiralty acted swiftly {{to take advantage of the}} wartime <b>commissioning</b> <b>clause,</b> and Empress of Japan was re-fitted. [...] During the war years, SS Empress of Japan was also refitted as an Armed Auxiliary Cruiser. [...] After the Armistice, this ship was the only one of the first three Empress ocean liners to return to the trans-Pacific route.|$|R

5000|$|The {{success of}} the Irish War of Independence, and the {{subsequent}} signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, {{led to the creation}} of the Irish Free State - a dominion established for the whole island of Ireland on 6 December 1922. The border became an international frontier after the Parliament of Northern Ireland exercised its right to opt out of the Free State on 7 December 1922. The partition of 1921 created only a provisional boundary; a Boundary Commission met in 1924-25 to fix a permanent border between the two jurisdictions [...] "in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants, so far as may be compatible with economic and geographic conditions". The manner in which the Boundary <b>Commission</b> <b>clause</b> was drafted in the Anglo-Irish Treaty was only explicit in its ambiguity. Amongst politicians in Southern Ireland, there was remarkably little attention paid to the clause during the debates on the Treaty. The Republican activist Sean MacEntee was a [...] "lone voice" [...] in warning that the commission would involve an exercise [...] "in transferring from the jurisdiction of the Government of Northern Ireland certain people and certain districts which that Government cannot govern; and by giving instead to Northern Ireland, certain other districts—unionist districts of Monaghan, Cavan and Donegal, so that not only under this Treaty are we going to partition Ireland, not only are we going to partition Ulster, but we are going to partition even the counties of Ulster." ...|$|E

50|$|Murdoch's News International {{acquired}} {{the group in}} February 1981. Murdoch, an Australian who in 1985 became a naturalised American citizen, already owned The Sun and the News of the World, but the Conservative government decided not to refer the deal to the Monopolies and Mergers <b>Commission,</b> citing a <b>clause</b> in the Fair Trading Act that exempted uneconomic businesses from referral. The Thomson Corporation had threatened to close the papers down {{if they were not}} taken over by someone else within an allotted time, and it was feared that any legal delay to Murdoch's takeover might lead to the two titles' demise. In return, Murdoch provided legally binding guarantees to preserve the titles' editorial independence.|$|R
40|$|In a few months, "We the People" {{will go to}} {{the polls}} and elect the electors who will elect (or, at least, have an {{opportunity}} to elect) the next President of the United States. Short of an act of God or an act of war, it is more likely than not that the next President will be a sitting United States Senator. The expectation is that a Senator/President-elect resigns his or her legislative seat some time prior taking the presidential oath of office. It is widely believed in large and influential academic circles and among the educated public generally that the Constitution requires this result by expressly precluding joint simultaneous Legislative-Executive Branch office holding. I respectfully dissent. I believe the conventional view is mistaken as a matter of the original public meaning of the Constitution. Although the idea of a sitting Senator holding the office of President is somewhat counter-intuitive, this is one example of the dangers of unexamined intuitions. True, the Constitution does preclude joint Legislative Branch-Executive Branch service. But for incompatibility purposes, the President {{is not part of the}} Executive Branch; rather, the (elected) President presides over it, as opposed to (appointed) Executive Branch officers [...] which are under it. Therefore, a sitting Senator can keep his or her seat while serving as President. In short, the Incompatibility Clause bars Representatives and Senators from "holding any office under the United States. " Here, I (further) argue that the phrase "office under the United States" is a term of art referring to statutory or appointed officers, not to the President. In short, the Incompatibility Clause does not bar joint Senate-Presidential office-holding; it bars Senators from working for the President (or being appointed by the President), it does not bar a Senator from being President. Professor Steven G. Calabresi disagrees. He states that my position is "utterly implausible. " This paper is my reply to Professor Calabresi's response to my opening statement. The focus of our exchange relates to the Oaths and Affirmations Clause, the Impeachments <b>Clause,</b> and the <b>Commissions</b> <b>Clause.</b> Professor Calabresi will write a rejoinder ending our 4 -part exchange. In addition to Professor Calabresi's response, which was part of the debate on PENNumbra, I had a similar exchange with Professor Prakash.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the legal issues}} related to software assistance and maintenance agreements. Contracts generally provide for highly diverse performances and are aimed at providing a global service. Since the assistance and maintenance agreement generally entails a long-term relationship, the regulations for long-term supply contract’s apply. Nevertheless, in specific circumstances, even the rules for service contracts may be applied. In Italy, like in other EU jurisdictions, the applicable regulatory framework depends {{on the content of}} the contract. The provider company naturally tends to restrict its liability in proportion to effectively <b>commissioned</b> activity. Exclusion <b>clauses</b> including intentional damage or gross negligence are void, while par. 2 of Article 1229 of the Italian Civil Code permits limitation of liability in cases of minor negligence. The impossibility of changing contractual terms disadvantages the weaker contracting party and the procedure imposed by par 2 of Art. 1341 c. c. has proved inadequate to protect the customer. Art. 9, of Law n 192 of 18 June 1998 (“Disciplina della subfornitura nelle attività produttive”), which is now considered to be general principle allows exclusion clauses providing for minor negligence to be deemed void, if they oversimplify the debtor position, by defining the requirements of minor negligence. In addition, clauses regarding exclusion or limitation of liability towards third parties, beyond the limit set by Art. 1229, require an assessment based {{on the nature of the}} interest which is concretely protected...|$|R
50|$|Several {{communities}} petitioned to {{be relieved}} {{of the war}} taxes. The ministry of war, however, increased the hurden, requiring that the communities of Pest, Óbuda, Kecskemét, Czegléd, Nagykőrös, and Irsa should pay this tax not in kind, but in currency {{to the amount of}} 2,300,000 gulden. As the communities were unable to collect such monies, they petitioned the government to remit it. The Jewish communities of the entire country were ordered to share in raising the sum, on the grounds that most of the Jews of Hungary had supported the Revolution. Only the communities of Temesvár (now Timişoara, Romania) and Pressburg (now Bratislava, Slovakia) were exempted from this order, as they remained loyal to the existing Austrian government. The military <b>commission</b> added a <b>clause</b> to tax requirements, to the effect that individuals or communities might be exempted from the punishment, if they could prove by documents or witnesses, before a commission to be appointed, that they had not taken part in the Revolution, either by word or deed, morally or materially. The Jews refused this means of clearing themselves. They declared to be willing to redeem the tax by collecting a certain sum for a national school fund. Emperor Franz Joseph remitted the war-tax (September 20, 1850), but ordered that the Jews of Hungary without distinction should contribute toward a Jewish school fund of 1,000,000 gulden; they raised this sum within a few years.|$|R
40|$|Genetically {{modified}} organisms (GMOs) and derived {{food and}} feed products are subject to a risk analysis and regulatory approval before they can enter {{the market in the}} European Union (EU). In this risk analysis process, the role of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which was created in 2002 in response to multiple food crises, is to independently assess and provide scientific advice to risk managers on any possible risks that the use of GMOs may pose to human and animal health and the environment. EFSA's scientific advice is elaborated by its GMO Panel with the scientific support of several working groups and EFSA's GMO Unit. This review presents EFSA's scientific activities and highlights its achievements on the risk assessment of GMOs for the first 10 years of its existence. Since 2002, EFSA has issued 69 scientific opinions on genetically modified (GM) plant market registration applications, of which 62 for import and processing for {{food and feed}} uses, six for cultivation and one for the use of pollen (as or in food), and 19 scientific opinions on applications for marketing products made with GM microorganisms. Several guidelines for the risk assessment of GM plants, GM microorganisms and GM animals, as well as on specific issues such as post-market environmental monitoring (PMEM) were elaborated. EFSA also provided scientific advice upon request of the European <b>Commission</b> on safeguard <b>clause</b> and emergency measures invoked by EU Member States, annual PMEM reports, the potential risks of new biotechnology-based plant breeding techniques, evaluations of previously assessed GMOs in the light of new scientific publications, and the use of antibiotic resistance marker genes in GM plants. Future challenges relevant to the risk assessment of GMOs are discussed. EFSA's risk assessments of GMO applications ensure that data are analysed and presented in a way that facilitates scientifically sound decisions that protect human and animal health and the environment.
