AFBCA ensured that property at these Air Force installations was made available for reuse. The agency provided civilian reuse transition planning <b>caretaker</b> <b>services</b> to include installation protection, maintenance, and operations.

5000|$|Mys Shmidta Airport (Аэропорт Мыс Шмидта) , {{also known}} as Cape Shmidt Airport, is a former {{military}} airbase in the Iultinsky District of Chukotka, Russia. It is located 3 km southeast of Mys Shmidta.It is a major airfield with a 2450 x 60 m concrete tarmac. It was built in 1954 [...] as an Arctic staging base for intercontinental bomber flights, with <b>caretaker</b> <b>services</b> provided by OGA (Arctic Control Group). The gravel overrun suggests that the runway was to eventually be extended to 3000 m. Unlike airports such as the Provideniya Bay Airport, which {{has always been a}} civilian airport, or the Iultin Airport, which was constructed specifically to serve the needs of the remote mine nearby, the Mys Shmidta airport was initially part of the ring of forward staging bases used by the Arctic Control Group (OGA) prior to intercontinental ballistic missiles gaining favour as the primary means of long-range defense.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{draws on}} field study data {{to provide an}} {{examination}} of the condominium owner / manager relationship in the Australian tourism context. Although there has been considerable growth in tourism accommodation owned through strata-title, no research examining the somewhat idiosyncratic relationship between unit owners and resident managers has been found in the literature. The peculiar nature of the relationship underlines its significance as a context in which to apply the agency theoretical model. As Australian condominium resident unit managers provide letting and <b>caretaker</b> <b>services</b> for condominium unit owners, it appears the relationship can be justifiably viewed as a principal-agent exchange (Mills, 1990). The study specifically focuses on strata title condominiums located in major tourism regions. This sub-sector of the condominium management industry was chosen for study because it exhibits several key attributes distinguishing it from the non-tourist based condominium sector. For example, two different parties represent the principal (resident owners and investor owners), also a significant proportion of a resident manager's work relates to the management of short-term holiday unit letting. In light of the particular agency relationship dynamics arising in large tourist-based condominium governance, several suggestions concerning the legal environment of the industry are provided.

30|$|After the danwei freed family-related services, the Women {{federation}} quickly {{took over}} the job and actively organized market-oriented domestic services. The Women Domestic Services Centre (Sanba jiazheng fuwu zhongxin) was established in Beijing in 1983, becoming China first domestic services centre. 3 It assumed two functions. It was finding domestic services for urban families, and it was finding work in the cities for women from impoverished regions. More than 200, 000 rural women from impoverished regions have come to Beijing through Women’s Federations to work, providing <b>caretaker</b> <b>services</b> to more than 600, 000 families since 1983.4 The Women Domestic Services Centre {{plays the role of}} intermediary and bridge. It has a cooperative relationship with local women’s federations, which are responsible for finding women who need to leave their localities to work. The company and the family requiring domestic services sign an introduction contract, and the domestic worker is recommended to the client family as a commercial product. The client family pays an intermediary’s fee, and if the worker is considered unsuitable, the family can send the worker back to the organization, which will make a total of three introductions. Domestic workers have an intermediary relationship with the company; they have no labour contract, health insurance, retirement benefits, workers’ compensation or other social security, and can easily be dismissed from their jobs.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to propose a concept for a virtual coach to be used by people who suffer from costly and challenging diseases such as dementia, depression, diabetes and cardiac related issues, and by their <b>caretakers</b> presenting healthcare <b>service</b> providers or family members of the people suffering from the named diseases. Those listed diseases form almost an unbearable burden for individual persons, their next-of-kin, and those providing health services. The construction of the concept was based on earlier knowledge, and guidelines proposed for design science research were applied. The proposed concept is to sketch a virtual coach that utilizes sensor-based data and written diaries, and that helps patients and their caretakers to get accurate and individual information to support everyday life and healthcare...|$|R

40|$|For the {{purposes}} of this study, social need is defined as need at an aggregate level, as expressed in statements of the form "Community X needs provision Y". The assessment of social need is of central importance in the determination of resource allocation, and "needs studies" are a major tool of social planners and researchers. Social indicators are also seen as being useful for determining social need. An examination of the literature relating to resource allocation reveals that there are some inadequacies in the way social need has been conceptualised, and that it has often been understood from within an essentially positivist perspective, as having some sort of independent existence and as being objectively measurable. Further conceptual exploration leads to an alternative formulation, where the emphasis is on the act of definition of social need, rather than on need per se. A model of social need statements is proposed, based on three different forms of need definition which are referred to as population defined need, care-taker defined need and inferred need. In any particular case of assessing the need for a specific service, or the needs of a particular community, there may be differences between these three forms of need definition. Several propositions are developed suggesting factors which may be significant in influencing judgements of social need, and which may lead to differences between population defined, caretaker defined and inferred need statements. These factors relate to the type of community, the type of provision or service, and the design and methodology of the needs study. An exploratory research study was designed to investigate these propositions about factors which may affect need judgements. Three different communities in southern Tasmania were selected, and the "needs" for four different forms of social provision were studied in each area. The overall "needs" of each community were also investigated. The research was undertaken in order to deter-mine a picture of population defined, caretaker defined and inferred need for each study area. Several different methodologies were used: a household survey, a survey of <b>caretakers</b> (<b>service</b> providers and opinion leaders), analysis of census data, analysis of service statistics and newspaper monitoring. The results of the research clarify the differences between the three forms of need statement. They indicate some of the factors which may be significant in contributing to these differences, and in affecting the way social need is defined. It is concluded that the proposed model of need statements represents a potentially useful framework for the study of social need, and {{on the basis of the}} research results the model is used to derive a number of suggestions for the design, assessment and analysis of needs studies. A frame-work for community development, based on the model, is also proposed, and further research questions arising from the study are identified...|$|R

40|$|Background: The Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) {{services}} {{have been provided}} in Tanzania since 1975. However between 2004 and 2007 coverage of third dose of Diptheria- Tetanus-Pertussis-Hepatitis (DTP-HB 3) dropped from 81 % to 47 % in Bariadi District. This study investigated factors associated with the uptake of vaccination services among children aged 12 - 23 months in this district. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess uptake of vaccinations among children and the knowledge of their <b>caretakers</b> on vaccination <b>services.</b> Multistage random sampling was conducted to select wards, villages and households with children aged 12 - 24 months. Logistic regression was performed to identify determinants of full vaccination status. Analysis was done using EpiInfo 3. 5. 1. Results: A total of 243 caretakers with their children aged between 12 - 23 months were studied. The {{mean age of the}} children was 17 months. Out of 243 caretakers, RCH cards for 219 (90. 1 %) children were reviewed. A total of 77 (35. 2 %) children were vaccinated for oral polio vaccine at birth; 204 (93. 2 %) for DTP-HB 3, and 180 (82. 2 %) for measles. One hundred and seventy children (77. 6 %) were fully vaccinated. Of 243 caretakers, 174 (7 l. 6 %) knew the purpose of vaccinations in children, 143 (58. 8 %) knew {{at least one of the}} immunizable diseases in Tanzania, and 13 (5. 3 %) knew the vaccination schedule. Logistic regression found caretakers' understanding of the purpose of vaccination was significantly correlated with full vaccination status of the child (A OR = 2. 80, Cl l. 32 - 5. 94, p=O. OI). Conclusions: The proportion of fully vaccinated children was not optimum, however, uptake of individual routinely administered antigens was high with the exception of OPV. It is recommended that community awareness on vaccination and vaccination services is increased to improve uptake further...|$|R
40|$|In South Africa, {{access to}} safe {{drinking}} water is a human right that is explicitly stated in the constitution. Most metro municipalities are meeting the drinking water quality targets, but the smaller rural environments are failing to provide water of acceptable drinking water quality. Reasons contributing to {{the high incidence of}} unacceptable water quality are the rural municipalities' inadequate institutional capacity and lack of management and monitoring of drinking water services. This study investigates the possibilities of supporting rural water service institutions to manage their remote water supply schemes better by addressing the challenge of distance monitoring. Through the creation of real-time information flow between the water service authorities and the water supply caretakers in remote villages, it is to be tested if better information can be received and the status of the rural water supply quality can be monitored. The improvement of information flow is based on introducing a mobile phone application. The hypothesis is that through improving the information flow, decisions on water supply management will be improved. Case study research was conducted in rural municipalities situated in the Northern Cape Province and Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Four different municipalities were chosen to reveal the diverse municipal set-up and different challenges facing rural municipalities. Data was gathered through interviews conducted with the municipal mangers over a seven month period, as well as through field investigations. The findings reveal that the mobile reporting system has improved information flow from water supply <b>caretakers</b> to government <b>service</b> providers. The mobile application allowed for distance monitoring of rural water supply schemes. It has helped address the municipalities' institutional capacity problems by improving access to information relevant to decision making. Through the data records displayed on the mobile application, municipal mangers were able to track the supply caretakers' performance and subsequently hold them accountable. Through an increase in data availability, water quality failures were easily identified, resulting in improved confidence in the quality of rural water supply. The access to real-time information has improved the monitoring and communication of rural water quality. Early intervention and the management of non-compliance improved. The mobile technology provided the municipal managers with a tool to monitor their rural water supply schemes more regularly, but it also became apparent that the management of such schemes only improved if relevant action was taken based on the information received. Greater improvement was seen in municipalities where the tool was used consistently, where time was set aside to follow up on data warnings and protocols existed to follow up on non-compliance issues. Management of the resources did not improve in areas where management staff was severely overstretched and response strategies to problems were non-existent before the implementation of the tool...|$|R
