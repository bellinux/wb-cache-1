RDI {{was committed to}} very low energy use {{from the beginning of}} the design process throughout construction. Key features include: 1. Careful site plan so that all homes have solar access (for active and passive); 2. Cellulose insulation providing R- 40 walls, R- 50 ceiling, and R- 40 floors; 3. Triple-pane windows; 4. Airtight construction (~ 0. 1 CFM 50 /ft 2 enclosure area); 5. Solar water heating systems with tankless, gas, auxiliary heaters; 6. PV systems (2. 8 or 3. 4 kWSTC); 7. 2 - 4 bedrooms, 1, 100 - 1, 700 ft 2. The design heating loads in the homes were so small that each home is heated with a single, sealed-combustion, natural gas room heater. The cost savings from the simple HVAC systems made possible the tremendous investments in the homes' envelopes. The Consortium for Advanced Residential Buildings (CARB) monitored temperatures and comfort in several homes during the winter of 2009 - 2010. In the Spring of 2011, CARB obtained utility bill information from 13 occupied homes. Because of efficient lights, appliances, and conscientious home occupants, the energy generated by the solar electric systems exceeded the electric energy used in most homes. Most homes, in fact, had a net credit from the electric utility over the course of a year. On the natural gas side, total gas costs averaged $ 377 per year (for heating, water heating, cooking, and clothes drying). Total energy costs were even less - $ 337 per year, including all utility fees. The highest annual energy bill for any home evaluated was $ 458; the lowest was $ 171...|$|E
40|$|It is {{an honor}} and a {{pleasure}} to have the December 2013 issue of Higher Learning Research Communications dedicate its issue to selected papers from the 4 th International Conference on Teaching and Learning, held in Bangkok in November, 2013. The conference theme, Higher Learning in the ASEAN Context, highlights the emerging <b>community</b> <b>of</b> <b>ten</b> Southeast Asian nations and the upcoming launch of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) in 2015. The AEC will affect higher education systems in Southeast Asia in terms of harmonization of higher education and student mobility. This emerging regional demographic gives us a glimpse of the future of transnational education. The papers selected for this issue represent research both within and outside of ASEAN, all touching on aspects of transnational education. Jeannin reports on how diversity affects students’ learning in an international classroom in Thailand. Billingham, Gragg, and Bentley (Australia) highlight technology integration as an internationalizing practice. Ling considers challenges and outcomes of bilingual teaching and learning at the graduate level in Vietnam, contributing to the postgraduate educational field, which has not been amply explored in this matter. Stetz and Bauman (US) ask us to rethink the efficacy of recording our lectures for online viewing. Hartfield (Australia), Beltram-Cruz (Philippines), and Cruz (Philippines) review new pedagogical paradigms utilizing technology. Al-Masum and Chowdhury report on problems and progress at Bangladesh Open University in bringing higher education to an underserved population. Throughout this issue, the authors bring a sense of internationality and the transnational transformation of higher education, along with the ubiquity of technology {{in the hands of the}} students and its impact on our teaching and learning styles. This issue of the HLRC Journal highlights some impacts that ASEAN and the AEC can and will have on higher education everywhere...|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} of the dysbiosed gut microbiota in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is gaining more attention as a novel target to control this disease. Probiotic treatment with butyrate-producing bacteria has therapeutic potential since these bacteria are depleted in IBD patients and butyrate has beneficial effects on epithelial barrier function and overall gut health. However, studies assessing the effect of probiotic supplementation on microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions are rare. In this study, butyrate-producing bacteria (three mono-species and one multispecies mix) were supplemented to the fecal microbial <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>ten</b> Crohn's disease (CD) patients in an in vitro system simulating the mucus-and lumen-associated microbiota. Effects of supplementation in short-chain fatty acid levels, bacterial colonization of mucus environment and intestinal epithelial barrier function were evaluated.

Treatments with B. pullicaecorum 25 - 3 (T) and the mix of six butyrate-producers improved epithelial barrier integrity in vitro. This study provides proof-of-concept data for the therapeutic potential of butyrate-producing bacteria in CD and supports the future preclinical development of a probiotic product containing butyrate-producing species...|$|R
