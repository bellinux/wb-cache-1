5|$|Abūʾl Nasr Manṣūr ibn Luʾluʾ, {{also known}} by his laqab (honorific epithet) of Murtaḍā al-Dawla ("Approved of the Dynasty"), was {{the ruler of}} the Emirate of Aleppo between 1008 and 1016. He succeeded his father Lu'lu' al-Kabir, {{with whom he had}} shared power. Unlike Lu'lu', however, Mansur's rule was opposed by Aleppo's notables, who <b>chafed</b> at his oppression and monopolization of power. Both Mansur and his father harassed the {{remaining}} members of the Hamdanid dynasty, in whose name they ostensibly ruled. On the diplomatic front, Mansur balanced ties with both the Byzantine Empire and the Fatimid Caliphate, and maintained the emirate's Shia Muslim orientation.|$|E

He finally managed to obtain a posting as a flight commander with No.56 Squadron RFC, considered to be as close to an elite unit as any established by the RFC. Ball was still first among Britain's aces, and some documents hint that his attachment to No.56 Squadron was planned to be temporary. According to one account he had been slated to serve with the unit for only a month to mentor novice pilots.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Depression in the United Kingdom, the {{government}} became more parsimonious with funding for science. At the same time, Lawrence's recent invention, the cyclotron, promised to revolutionise experimental nuclear physics, and Chadwick felt that the Cavendish laboratory would fall behind unless it also acquired one. He therefore <b>chafed</b> under Rutherford, who clung to the belief that good nuclear physics could still be done without large, expensive equipment, and turned down the request for a cyclotron.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chafing</b> {{refers to}} the {{irritation}} of skin caused by repetitive friction, usually generated through skin to skin contact of multiple body parts. <b>Chafing</b> is usually contracted in the inner thighs and inner glutes; armpits and nipples can also develop <b>chafing</b> although it is less common. Severe <b>chafing</b> is known as friction burn.|$|R

5|$|However, a major rift {{of opinion}} {{existed between the}} Japanese {{government}} and its two field armies, the SEA and 10th Army, which as of November were both nominally {{under the control of}} the Central China Area Army led by SEA commander Matsui. Matsui made clear to his superiors even before he left for Shanghai that he wanted to march on Nanking. He was convinced that the conquest of the Chinese capital city of Nanking would provoke the fall of the entire Nationalist Government of China and thus hand Japan a quick and complete victory in its war on China. Yanagawa was likewise eager to conquer Nanking and both men <b>chafed</b> under the operation restriction line that had been imposed on them by the Army General Staff.|$|E
5|$|Spanish Florida {{never really}} {{recovered}} its economy or population {{from the effects}} of the war, and it was ceded to Britain in the 1763 Treaty of Paris following the Seven Years' War. Indians who had been resettled along the Atlantic coast <b>chafed</b> under British rule, as did those allied to the British in this war. This discontentment flared into the 1715 Yamasee War that posed a major threat to South Carolina's viability. The loss of population in the Spanish territories contributed to the 1732 founding of the Province of Georgia, which was granted on territory that Spain had originally claimed, as was also the case with Carolina. James Moore took military action against the Tuscaroras of North Carolina in the Tuscarora War which began in 1711, and many of them fled north as refugees to join their linguistic cousins the Iroquois.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, Houphouët {{was called}} by his tribe to assume the responsibilities of village chief. Preferring to pursue his medical career, he relinquished the office to his younger brother Augustin. Wishing to live closer to his village, he obtained a transfer to Dimbokro on 3 February 1934 and then to Toumodi on 28 June 1936. While Houphouët had displayed professional qualities, his attitude had <b>chafed</b> those around him. As a result, in September 1938, his clinical director demanded that he choose between {{his job as a}} doctor and his involvement in local politics. The choice was quickly made for him: his brother died in 1939, and Houphouët became chef de canton (an office created by the colonial administration to collect taxes). Due to this, Houphouët ended his medical career the next year.|$|E

5000|$|In sailing, <b>chafing</b> is {{the process}} of wear on a line or sail caused by {{constant}} rubbing against a hard, usually metallic, surface. Various methods are used to prevent <b>chafing.</b> <b>Chafing</b> of lines that rest on a choke on a boat can be prevented by putting a protecting material (sometimes as simple as a piece of old garden hose) around the line. <b>Chafing</b> of a sail rubbing against a cable can be prevented on large ships by tying around the cable.|$|R
50|$|Another common, running-related {{injury is}} <b>chafing,</b> caused by {{repetitive}} rubbing of {{one piece of}} skin against another, or against an article of clothing. One common location for <b>chafe</b> to occur is the runner's upper thighs. The skin feels coarse and develops a rash-like look. A variety of deodorants and special anti-chafing creams are available to treat such problems. <b>Chafe</b> {{is also likely to}} occur on the nipple. There are a variety of home remedies that runners use to deal with <b>chafing</b> while running such as band-aids and using grease to reduce friction. Prevention is key which is why form fitting cloths are important.|$|R
5|$|Named to the {{advisory}} group chosen {{to support the}} review board, Shea threw himself into the investigation, working eighty-hour weeks. Although the precise source of ignition was never found, {{it soon became clear}} that an electrical short somewhere in the command module had started the fire, probably sparked by a <b>chafed</b> wire. What was less clear was where to apportion responsibility. NASA engineers tended to point to what they saw as shoddy workmanship by North American Aviation. By contrast, North American executives blamed NASA management for its decision over their objections to pressurize the command module with pure oxygen to a pressure far in excess of that needed in space, in which almost any materialincluding Velcro, with which the cabin was filledwould instantly burst into flames if exposed to a spark. Whatever the precise distribution of responsibility, Shea remained haunted by the feeling that he, personally, was responsible for the deaths of three astronauts. For years after the fire, he displayed the portrait given to him by the Apollo 1 crew in the front hallway of his own home.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after taking}} office, Cleveland {{was faced with}} the task of filling all the {{government}} jobs for which the president had the power of appointment. These jobs were typically filled under the spoils system, but Cleveland announced that he would not fire any Republican who was doing his job well, and would not appoint anyone {{solely on the basis of}} party service. He also used his appointment powers to reduce the number of federal employees, as many departments had become bloated with political time-servers. Later in his term, as his fellow Democrats <b>chafed</b> at being excluded from the spoils, Cleveland began to replace more of the partisan Republican officeholders with Democrats.; this was especially the case with policy making positions. While some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns, more of Cleveland's appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors' administrations.|$|E
5|$|An {{offensive}}ly-minded defenceman, Niedermayer {{was best}} known for his skating ability and drew comparison's to the game's offensive greats from the time he broke into the NHL. He was compared to Paul Coffey for his ability to take the puck from his own goal line and convert a defensive situation into an offensive rush. He often <b>chafed</b> at playing within the Devils' defence-oriented system, feeling it restricted his offensive creativity, but also admitted that he learned to place greater emphasis on his defence and develop his overall game. Niedermayer earned a reputation for inconsistency early in his career. He often played his best games against top opposition, but his failure to consistently apply his skills against all opposition occasionally frustrated his teammates and left his coaches lamenting that he was a player capable of being dominant but often was not. By {{the end of his career}} however, and following his Norris Trophy win in 2004, Niedermayer was regarded as one of the top offensive defencemen of his generation and as one of the game's greatest winners. Niedermayer and former Ducks teammate Corey Perry are the only players in hockey history to win every major contemporary North American and International Competitive titles: the Memorial Cup, World Junior championship, Stanley Cup, World Championship, World Cup and Olympic Games.|$|E
