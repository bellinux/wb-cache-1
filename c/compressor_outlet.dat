25|$|The United States Air Corps {{wanted the}} {{aircraft}} to perform high altitude research and {{to test the}} feasibility of a pressurized cabin. The Corps contracted with Lockheed Aircraft Corporation to produce the aircraft at a total cost of $112,197. The requirements called for an aircraft capable of flying at no less than 25,000ft (7,620m) and having an endurance of ten hours {{with at least two}} hours above 25,000ft (7,620m). Major Carl Greene and John Younger, both structures experts who worked for the Air Corps Engineering Division at Wright Field in Ohio were responsible for the design of the pressurized cabin structure. Greene and Younger worked with Lockheed to modify a Model 10 Electra with a new fuselage consisting of a circular cross-section that was able to withstand up to a 10psi differential. New, smaller windows were used to prevent a possible blowout while operating at high pressure differentials. The cabin pressurization was provided by bleeding air from the engines' turbo supercharger, the <b>compressor</b> <b>outlet</b> fed into the cabin and was controlled by the flight engineer. This system was able to maintain a cabin altitude of 12,000ft (3,658m) while flying at 30,000ft (9,144m). The fuselage was divided into two compartments, a forward pressurized compartment, and an aft unpressurized compartment. The forward compartment housed two pilots, a flight engineer, and up to two passengers. The aft compartment provided accommodation for one passenger and could be used only at low altitudes since it lacked pressurization.|$|E

It inverts the neural network to find the optimum parameter value under given conditions (artificial neural network inverse, ANNi). In order to do so, first an artificial neural network (ANN) was developed to predict: compressor pressure ratio, isentropic compressor efficiency, corrected speed, and finally corrected air mass flow rate.

Finally, for the purpose of meeting hot water need as well as floor heating system requirements, it is seen that energy quality level of a waste low grade temperature heat source can be increased by using a {{heat pump system}}...|$|R
