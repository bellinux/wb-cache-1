No <b>Cutting</b> <b>Through</b> the Band: Due to the {{potential}} for injury to performers or intruders, no one except emergency medical personnel may <b>cut</b> <b>through</b> the band while in formation. If someone attempts to <b>cut</b> <b>through,</b> a band member first asks them politely to go around, and if necessary, briefly explains the tradition. If necessary, appropriate security personnel will be alerted. Likewise, should a band member see another member attempting to prevent an outsider from cutting through, assistance is required.

5|$|Most of US2, {{along with}} US23 in the Lower Peninsula, was {{designated}} the United Spanish War Veterans Memorial Highway in 1949.

Signs marking the highway were not erected until 1968 when Governor George W. Romney had them installed.|$|E

5|$|Bristol {{is part of}} a {{limestone}} area {{running from}} the Mendip Hills in the south to the Cotswolds in the northeast. The rivers Avon and Frome cut through the limestone to the underlying clay, creating Bristol's characteristically hilly landscape. The Avon flows from Bath in the east, through flood plains and areas which were marshes before the city's growth. To the west the Avon <b>cuts</b> <b>through</b> the limestone to form the Avon Gorge, aided by glacial meltwater after the last ice age.|$|E
5|$|State Route 139 (SR 139) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California. Running from SR 36 in Susanville north to Oregon Route 39, it forms part of the {{shortest}} route between Reno, Nevada, and Klamath Falls, Oregon. SR 139 <b>cuts</b> <b>through</b> much Modoc National Forest and passes near Antelope Mountain and Tule Lake. North of SR 299, the highway was built {{by the federal government}} and turned over to the state in about 1940; the remainder was built by a joint highway district of Lassen and Modoc Counties, completed in 1956, and given to the state in 1959.|$|E
5|$|The entire Slavonia {{belongs to}} the Danube basin and the Black Sea {{catchment}} area, but it is divided in two sub-basins. One of those drains into the Sava—itself a Danube tributary—and the other into the Drava or directly into the Danube. The drainage divide between the two sub-basins runs along Papuk and Krndija mountains, in effect tracing the southern boundary of the Virovitica-Podravina County and the northern boundary of Požega-Slavonia County, <b>cuts</b> <b>through</b> the Osijek-Podravina County north of Đakovo and finally bisects the Vukovar-Syrmia County running between Vukovar and Vinkovci to reach Fruška Gora southwest of Ilok.

5|$|Before the first-section groundbreaking, in 1937 {{the turnpike}} {{commission}} sent workers {{to assess the}} former railroad tunnels. In September of that year, a contract was awarded to drain water from the tunnels. After this, workers cleared rock slides and vegetation from the tunnel portals before evaluating the nine tunnels' condition. It was decided that six of the nine former South Pennsylvania Railroad tunnels {{could be used for}} the roadway. The Allegheny Mountain Tunnel was in too poor a condition for use, and the Quemahoning and Negro Mountain tunnels would be bypassed with rock <b>cuts</b> <b>through</b> the mountains; The Quemahoning Tunnel had been completed and used by the Pittsburgh, Westmoreland and Somerset Railroad.|$|E
5|$|Bond awakens, {{tied up with}} Natalya in the helicopter, {{which has}} been {{programmed}} to self-destruct. They escape but are captured and transported to the Russian military archives, where Minister of Defence Dimitri Mishkin interrogates them. Just as Natalya reveals {{the existence of a}} second satellite and Ourumov's involvement in the Siberian massacre, Ourumov arrives and kills Mishkin. Intending to frame Bond for the murder, he calls the guards, but Bond and Natalya escape. In the ensuing firefight, Natalya is captured. Bond steals a tank and pursues Ourumov through St. Petersburg to Trevelyan's train, where he kills Ourumov. Trevelyan escapes and locks Bond in the train with Natalya, setting it to self-destruct. As Bond <b>cuts</b> <b>through</b> the floor with his laser watch, Natalya triangulates Boris' satellite dish to Cuba. The two escape just before the train explodes.|$|E
5|$|Jeffrey Beaumont {{returns to}} his logging home town of Lumberton, North Carolina, from Oak Lake College after his father suffers a near-fatal stroke. While walking home from the hospital, he <b>cuts</b> <b>through</b> a vacant lot and discovers a severed ear. Jeffrey takes the ear to police detective John Williams and becomes reacquainted with the detective's daughter, Sandy. She tells him details about the ear case and a {{suspicious}} woman, Dorothy Vallens, who may {{be connected to the}} case. Increasingly curious, Jeffrey enters Dorothy's apartment by posing as an exterminator, and while Dorothy is distracted by a man dressed in a yellow suit at her door (whom Jeffrey later refers to as the Yellow Man), Jeffrey steals her spare key.|$|E

5|$|Lasers did {{not exist}} in 1959 when the book was written, nor did {{high-power}} industrial lasers at the time the film was made, making them a novelty. In the novel, Goldfinger uses a circular saw to try to kill Bond, but the filmmakers changed it to a laser to make the film feel fresher. Hamilton immediately thought of giving the laser a place in the film's story as Goldfinger's weapon of choice. Ken Adam was advised on the laser's design by two Harvard scientists who helped design the water reactor in Dr No. The laser beam itself was an optical effect added in post-production. For close-ups where the flame <b>cuts</b> <b>through</b> metal, technician Bert Luxford heated the metal with a blowtorch from underneath the table to which Bond was strapped.|$|E
5|$|Men were lowered by bucket {{down the}} airshafts to dig by candlelight. They were paid £1.50 per week to shovel 20 tons (20.32 tonnes) {{of rock and}} earth per 12–hour shift, seven days a week. Conditions were {{constantly}} wet, with foul air and gunpowder fumes and the danger of roof–collapse. The tunnel <b>cuts</b> <b>through</b> hard sandstone, shale and clay, and there are seven major faults in the rock near the centre point. The work was dangerous because the rock at the Horsforth end was difficult to blast, and there was frequent flooding and subsidence. About 1,563,480,000 gallons (7,107,580,080 litres) of water were pumped out of the workings between 1845 and 1849. Metal sheets had {{to be used to}} divert water inside the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|SR 125 {{begins as}} the South Bay Expressway toll road at an {{interchange}} with SR 11 and SR 905, although the southbound roadway ends {{just to the}} north at Otay Mesa Road, the former alignment of SR 905. The route heads north through an undeveloped area, encountering its first toll plaza just before entering the city of Chula Vista. The freeway <b>cuts</b> <b>through</b> the Eastlake neighborhood of Chula Vista before leaving the city and turning to the northeast, passing through Sweetwater Summit Regional Park near Sweetwater Reservoir. SR 125 intersects with SR 54, where the tolled portion ends. SR 54 runs concurrently with SR 125 north to the Jamacha Road exit. SR 125 continues north again through the unincorporated area of La Presa. The freeway briefly enters Lemon Grove before intersecting with SR 94 and crossing into the city of La Mesa.|$|E
