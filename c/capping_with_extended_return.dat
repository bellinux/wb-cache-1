40|$|The structure, {{morphology}} {{and surface}} topography of multilayer carbon nanotubes {{have been studied}} by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The carbon nanotube three-dimensional structure, and especially that near the cap regions, is resolved by use of these two complementary techniques. We have found that {{a large proportion of}} nanotubes have a cylindrical shaped body, with a significant number being polygonal in appearance. Polygonal <b>caps</b> <b>with</b> <b>extended</b> flat surfaces are also directly imaged by the TEM and AFM studies. We have achieved atomic resolution AFM imaging of a nanotube surface, showing the hexagonal arrays on the top layer akin to the graphite structure. These are arranged helically with respect to the tube axis. The observation of superpatterns, deviation of the surface trigonal patterns to nearly hexagonal patterns and an increase in interlayer distance compared with graphite, indicate stacking disorders between successive cylindrical layers. Dislocation defects on the surface can be clearly imaged by the AFM and it appears that, although most tubes appear to be formed by concentric tubes, some spiral structures can also occur...|$|R
5000|$|Longwing brogues (also {{known in}} the US as [...] "English" [...] brogues, and in the UK as [...] "American" [...] brogues) are Derby style shoes characterised by a pointed toe <b>cap</b> <b>with</b> wings that <b>extend</b> {{the full length of}} the shoe, meeting at a center seam at the heel.

40|$|We present Doppler {{images of}} the young K 5 V - K 7 V rapid rotator LO Peg from seven nights of {{continuous}} spectroscopy obtained in 1998 from July 04 to July 10. The images reveal {{the presence of a}} strong polar <b>cap</b> <b>with</b> appendages <b>extending</b> to mid-latitudes, but no starspots are seen below 15. We briefly discuss the distribution of spots in light of recent flux transport simulations which are able to reproduce the observed latitude dependence. With the full timeseries of spectra, of which 314 are useful, many phases are observed three times over the seven nights of observations. Using starspots as tracers of a solar-like latitudinal differential rotation in our image reconstructions, we find that the equatorial regions complete one more rotation than the polar regions every 181 ± 35 d. LO Peg is the second coolest star for which such a measurement has been made using indirect imaging methods. The degree of latitudinal shear is less than that seen in G and early K dwarfs, suggesting a trend in which differential rotation decreases with stellar mass in (pre-) main sequence objects.

40|$|King George Island {{is located}} at the {{northern}} tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, which is influenced by maritime climate conditions. The observed mean annual air temperature at sea level is - 2. 4 °C. Thus, the ice cap is regarded as sensitive to changing climatic conditions. Ground-penetrating radar surveys indicate a partly temperate ice <b>cap</b> <b>with</b> an <b>extended</b> water layer at the firn/ice transition of the up to 700 m high ice cap. Measured firn temperatures are close to 0 °C at the higher elevations, and they differ considerably from the measured mean annual air temperature. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present ice-flow dynamics by means of observations and simulations of the flow velocities. During several field campaigns from 1997 / 98 to 2008 / 09, ice surface velocities were derived with repeated differential GPS measurements. Ice velocities vary from 0. 7 m/a at the dome to 112. 1 m/a along steep slopes. For the western part of the ice cap a three-dimensional diagnostic full-Stokes model was applied to calculate ice flow. Parameters of the numerical model were identified with respect to measured ice surface velocities. The simulations indicate cold ice at higher elevations, while temperate ice at lower elevations is consistent with the observations...|$|R
30|$|But the {{importance}} of commodities <b>with</b> increasing <b>returns</b> <b>extends</b> beyond elasticities, innovation, job ladders and diversification. There are many important positive externalities from a system of production based on economic activities with increasing returns. In particular, higher wages and profits spill over into other sectors increasing the overall standard of living. Bus drivers in Africa are no less efficient or productive than bus drivers in say, London. Yet, in a common currency, the wage differential is substantial. Reinert (2008) contends that the differences in production structures can explain the wage differential.|$|R
