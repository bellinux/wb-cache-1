5|$|In September 1786, at the Annapolis <b>Convention,</b> {{delegates from}} five states {{called for a}} Constitutional <b>Convention</b> {{in order to discuss}} {{possible}} improvements to the Articles of Confederation. The Constitutional <b>Convention</b> took place in Philadelphia on May 14, 1787. Rhode Island, fearing that the <b>Convention</b> would work to its disadvantage, boycotted the <b>Convention</b> and, when the Constitution was put to the states, initially refused to ratify it.|$|E
5|$|The 1964 Supreme <b>Convention</b> was {{scheduled}} to be held at the Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans. A few days before the <b>Convention,</b> new Supreme Knight John W.

The hotel changed its policy and so did the Order. The <b>Convention</b> amended the admissions rule to require that a new applicant could not be rejected by less than one-third of those voting. In 1972 the Supreme <b>Convention</b> amended its rules again, requiring a majority of members voting to reject a candidate.|$|E

Also in 1892, Tongue served as a delegate to the Republican National <b>Convention</b> held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and served as the vice president of the Oregon delegation to the <b>convention</b> in 1894.|$|E
5|$|A {{contingent}} of 250 National Guard engineering units occupied {{one part of}} the <b>convention</b> center beginning August 30 and remained there until September 1, at times barricaded in their location. The units were never given orders to control the crowd, and were not expected to be prepared for such a task, as engineering units. The number of people at the <b>convention</b> center continued to grow over the next three days by some estimates to as many as 20,000people. Reasons for arriving included being sent to the <b>convention</b> center from the overwhelmed Superdome, being dropped off there by rescuers, or hearing about the <b>convention</b> center as a shelter via word of mouth. No checking for weapons was done among the crowd as was done at the Superdome, and a large store of alcohol kept at the <b>Convention</b> Center was looted. Reports of robberies, murder, and rape began to surface. In general, those who died, regardless of cause of death, were not moved or removed and were left to decompose.|$|E
50|$|Philadelphia was {{the hub of}} the Colored <b>Conventions</b> {{movement}} for several years before nearby cities such as New York City, Albany, and Pittsburgh also starting hosting <b>conventions.</b> By the 1850s, the <b>conventions</b> were extremely popular and multiple national, state, and local <b>conventions</b> were held every year. Although the majority of these <b>conventions</b> were held in northern, particularly New England states, <b>conventions</b> are documented as taking place in Kansas, Louisiana, and California. The <b>conventions</b> also attracted the most prominent African American leaders from across the country, including Frederick Douglass, Charles Bennett Ray, Lewis Hayden, Charles Lenox Remond, Mary Ann Shadd and William Still.|$|R

5|$|A {{group of}} Louisville Democrats, {{supporters}} of U. S.

Brown would accept the nomination of a second <b>convention,</b> should one be held. As Brown had been thought to be a supporter of Goebel, this announcement caused no small stir among Democrats. Representatives of sixty counties attended the August 2 meeting in Lexington. Resolutions endorsing the Democratic platform from the 1896 Democratic National <b>Convention</b> and the candidacy of William Jennings Bryan in 1900 were adopted. Then, ex-governor Brown addressed the crowd. Finally, the representatives agreed to a nominating <b>convention</b> to be held on August 16.|$|E

He was an unsuccessful candidate for the House of Representatives in 1896, losing to Republican Walter Evans. He would later claim that he had only run {{in order to improve}} Democratic voter turnout for William Jennings Bryan's 1896 presidential bid. Prior to the 1899 Democratic nominating <b>convention,</b> Brown was mentioned as a possible gubernatorial nominee, but he declined to become a candidate.

40|$|Recent work in {{personal}} identity has {{emphasized the importance}} of various <b>conventions,</b> or "person-directed practices" in the determination of personal identity. An interesting question arises as to whether we should think that there are any entities that have, in some interesting sense, conventional identity conditions. We think {{that the best way to}} understand such work about practices and <b>conventions</b> is the strongest and most radical. If these considerations are correct, persons are, on our view, conventional constructs: they are in part constituted by certain <b>conventions.</b> A person exists only if the relevant <b>conventions</b> exist. A person will be a conscious being of a certain kind combined with a set of <b>conventions.</b> Some of those <b>conventions</b> are encoded in the being itself, so requiring the <b>conventions</b> to exist is requiring the conscious being to be organized in a particular way. In most cases the <b>conventions</b> in question are settled. There is no dispute about what the <b>conventions</b> are, and thus no dispute about which events a person can survive. These are cases where we take the <b>conventions</b> so much for granted, that it is easy to forget that they are there, and that they are necessary constituents of persons. Sometimes though, <b>conventions</b> are not settled. Sometimes there is a dispute about what the <b>conventions</b> should be, and thus a dispute about what events a person can survive. These are the traditional puzzle cases of personal identity. That it appears that <b>conventions</b> play a part in determining persons 2 ̆ 7 persistence conditions only in these puzzle cases is explained by the fact that only in these cases are the <b>conventions</b> unsettled. Settled or not though, <b>conventions</b> are necessary constituents of persons...|$|R

Due to the influence of Laffoon and Rhea, the Democratic Party again chose a nominating <b>convention</b> in lieu of a primary to choose their gubernatorial candidate. Because Laffoon supporters controlled the state Democratic Central Committee and most of the county political organizations, a <b>convention</b> would favor Laffoon's choice of gubernatorial nominee.
