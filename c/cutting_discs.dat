The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate performance of different mechanisms regarding straw mobilization, employed in a no-till seeder. The experimental area was conducted on clayey soil under no-tillage with a large quantity of sorghum residue. The experiment was established in a randomized block design, as the treatments consisted of a combination of two mechanisms at front of the furrow opener composed of <b>cutting</b> <b>disc</b> and row cleaners, and three mechanisms behind the seed furrower, covering discs prototype model M 1, Spider and commercial model, with the combination of <b>cutting</b> <b>disc</b> and Spider model not being evaluated. We assessed the coverage permanence on soil index, vegetation mass on surface and inside the line. The treatment containing the row cleaner mechanism efficiently removed straw from the surface of sowing line as well as the return one acted on straw replacement. It was identified that use of the <b>cutting</b> <b>disc</b> at the front of seeder contributed to the increase of straw installation inside the line, three times more than in the row cleaner system when operating individually. Covering mechanism with row cleaners reduced straw inside the line and kept line covering similar to treatment of <b>cutting</b> <b>disc</b> operating alone...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Intensification of soil {{compaction}} process under no-tillage (NT) is motivating {{the search for}} alternatives to mitigate {{soil compaction}} state. This study evaluated changes in soil physical and hydraulic properties caused by seeder with fertilizer shanks at different depths compared with the double discs lagged seeder, to investigate the possibility of soil decompaction by sowing under NT in southern Brazil. The {{study was conducted in}} a clayed Oxisol, for 27 years under NT. Treatments were three planting mechanisms: S 0. 10 m: <b>cutting</b> <b>disc</b> combined with shank acting to 0. 10 m depth; S 0. 15 m: <b>cutting</b> <b>disc</b> combined with shank acting to 0. 15 m depth and, D 0. 07 m: double discs lagged acting to 0. 07 m depth in an experimental randomized block design with four replications. We evaluated the soil mechanical resistance, water infiltration rate, soil bulk density, pore size distribution and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. Results indicated that the use of seeder with fertilizer shanks acting at 0. 15 m deep promoted the soil decompaction by the reduction of penetration resistance and increase of porosity and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. To have significant increase in water infiltration rate the fertilizer shanks of the seeder must be deepened to the lower limit of the compacted surface layer...|$|R
50|$|The first TBM that {{tunneled}} {{a substantial}} distance {{was invented in}} 1863 and improved in 1875 by British Army officer Major Frederick Edward Blackett Beaumont (1833-1895); Beaumont's machine was further improved in 1880 by British Army officer Major Thomas English (1843-1935). In 1875, the French National Assembly approved {{the construction of a}} tunnel under the English Channel and the British Parliament allowed a trial run to be made; English's TBM was chosen for the project. The cutting head of English's TBM consisted of a conical drill bit behind which were a pair of opposing arms on which were mounted <b>cutting</b> <b>discs.</b> From June 1882 to March 1883, the machine tunneled, through chalk, a total of 6,036 feet (1.84 km). However, despite this success, the cross-Channel tunnel project was abandoned in 1883 after the British military raised fears that the tunnel might be used as an invasion route. Nevertheless, in 1883, this TBM was used to bore a railway ventilation tunnel — 7 feet (2.1 m) in diameter and 6,750 feet (2 km) long — between Birkenhead and Liverpool, England, through sandstone under the Mersey River.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} master {{thesis is}} {{an analysis of}} several factors that influence the performance of abrasive <b>cutting</b> <b>discs.</b> It {{has been done in}} collaboration {{with one of the most}} important companies worldwide in the construction tool industry. To keep the confidentiality of this company, this study will refer to it under the name HAG. Contrary to other tools, the performance of abrasive <b>cutting</b> <b>discs</b> is extremely variable depending on many different factors. These multiple factors are extremely diverse and can vary from storage conditions to tool usage. Therefore, this study is developed to obtain precise knowledge on these influential factors so that HAG can take advantage of their direct sales force to access their customers and train the users on how to maximize the performance of their HAG abrasive discs. Based on the available literature and interviews with experts in abrasives manufacturing and testing, this study provides a technical overview on abrasive discs properties, their manufacturing and the grinding process itself. Furthermore, it accurately identifies the most relevant influential factors on the performance of abrasive discs and specific tests are performed to quantify their impact. The mentioned tests provide solid results that have endowed HAG with a profound technical understanding about this sourced product. It has also enabled them to draw precise recommendations on key aspects to optimize the performance of HAG abrasive discs that sales representatives should use as selling arguments. This would not only increase the value of the discs but would also endow HAG salespeople with the image of product experts. The impact of the conclusions extracted from this study is highly interesting for HAG since the deep product knowledge provided will allow customers to use their discs more efficiently and this will, most certainly, imply an increase on the sales of abrasive discs at no additional cost...|$|E
40|$|Straw on sowing line modifies seed {{germination}} environment regarding temperature and water content. Given these considerations, {{the aim of}} this study was to evaluate different mechanisms for coverage mobilization on the sowing line and their effect on germination environment of maize seeds, mainly in relation to the dynamics of straw in the seedbed, water content and soil temperature. Treatments consisted on the combination of two mechanisms at front of furrow opener, composed of <b>cutting</b> <b>disc</b> and row cleaners, with three mechanisms behind the seed furrower for returning the soil, consisting of three covering mechanisms, commercial and prototype models. It was found that straw presence on the surface of sowing line contributed to germination of maize seeds, maintenance of temperature and soil water content. The <b>cutting</b> <b>disc</b> treatment, associated with prototype, introduced percentages of water content near the ones in bottom layer, and this soil water content was 29. 7 % with 93. 75 % of straw coverage and deeper seeding depth, granting better conditions for {{seed germination}}. However, the straw coverage removal on soil by the row cleaners and its low sowing depth caused water loss in the lines resulting in great reduction of the emergence speed index in maize seedlings...|$|R

40|$|Soil {{compaction}} {{is considered}} one of the main causes of pasture degradation. Several techniques can be applied to reduce compacted soil layers. Chisel plowing is one of the farming expedients that present the most positive aspects regarding the soil conservation management. The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in soil penetration resistance, soil porosity and bulk density in an oxisol soil of a pasture field after chisel plowing. The experiment was set up in Nova Odessa (SP) on a Brachiaria decumbens Stapf. field, using a chisel plow with <b>cutting</b> <b>discs</b> and winged tips. The soil penetration resistance was evaluated with an electronic hydraulic penetrographer, and the porosity and bulk density with undeformed samples. The soil layers identified by multivariate data analysis of the soil penetration resistance were changed by soil scarification. The soil scarification procedure decreased the soil penetration resistance. The soil scarification showed the highest changes in physical attributes in the layer of 0. 0 - 0. 1 m, between the lines of the chisel plow shanks...|$|E
40|$|Compared to {{conventional}} bonding technology, adhesive bonding has advantages because the cutting segments are bonded to the saw blade at temperatures that cause no {{change to the}} internal stress or {{to the strength of}} the surrounding material. Adhesive bonding technology thus brings considerable benefits. The selection and qualification of the adhesive will be presented and a production module for manufacturing bonded <b>cutting</b> <b>discs</b> will be introduced. The strength values in the axial direction determined in static tests beat the value specified in the "Principles for the testing and certification of abrasive tools with diamond and boron nitride" (BGG 932 and 933, formerly ZH 675 and 676). To demonstrate the practical viability of this process, the presentation also reports results from examinations where a saw blade in a bridge saw was directly fitted with some new cutting segments. The performance of the tool was tested for granite. Cutting tests showed that the tool with the bonded cutting segments was equivalent to a brazed/welded reference tool with regards to its usage and the quality of cut...|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} the rational order of disk tools placement on the working body {{is necessary to}} know {{the maximum amount of}} rock, destroyed by the disk tool in benching cutting mode depending on the tool geometry parameters, physical and mechanical parameters of rocks. The article contains the definition of rational parameters of cutting disk tools as well as power and energy parameters of the destruction process by cutting disks and by executive body of the coal cutter. The rational geometric parameters of <b>cutting</b> <b>discs</b> are specified. It was found that each step of cutting with a minimum depth of penetration has its own maximum height of bench outcrop. The dependence of the volumes of large items destroyed by the disk tool on the cutting step height was determined. The existence of the cyclic alternation of destruction phases, regardless the fracture parameters, the height of the ledge outcrop, and tools like free cutting geometry were found. In contrast to the free cutting in benching mode of destruction two large fragments of rocks in one cycle were observed. Consequently, the cyclical nature of the destruction process in the benching mode will be characterized by two chips and crushing, and this cycling repeats throughout the destruction process with the same parameters of destruction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{investigation}} {{examines the}} possibility of adding niobium (Nb) to the Fe-Cu system in order to obtain, after powder compaction and sintering, a binder material (bonding matrix) with the adequate wear properties needed for the fabrication of diamond impregnated tools for stone cutting. The main objective is the replacement of cobalt (Co) by Nb in the Fe-Cu-Co alloys that are currently used in diamond tools. For this purpose, a comparative study has been conducted on some selected compositions of matrices integrated in <b>cutting</b> <b>discs.</b> Results of diamond impregnated 25 wt%Fe- 50 wt%Cu- 25 wt%Nb and 25 wt%Fe- 50 wt%Cu- 25 wt%Co matrices are directly compared because all tests were conducted under similar conditions. Two types of diamonds were used: without coating and Ti-coated. After the hot-pressing cycles, the main mechanical properties of the sintered bodies were evaluated. Cutting tests under real conditions, in Porriño granite, were carried out to compare {{the performance of the}} tools. Although the mechanical properties of the matrices with Nb were different from those found in the matrices with Co, the results obtained from the cutting tests have revealed that the tools made of 25 wt%Fe- 50 wt%Cu- 25 wt%Nb and 25 wt%Fe- 50 wt%Cu- 25 wt%Co matrices, both with 50 / 60 mesh diamonds, show quite similar behaviour during the cutting operations, thus indicating that replacement of Co by Nb is a promising route to be followed in the near future...|$|E
40|$|Conservation tillage (CT) {{is defined}} as a system of {{planting}} (seeding) crops into untilled soil by opening a narrow slot, trench or band only of sufficient width and depth to obtain proper seed coverage. No other soil tillage is done (Phillips and Young, 1973). This has been demonstrated and extended by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture (Gao et al., 1999) in the annual double-cropping (winter wheat - Triticum aestivum, L., and summer maize - Zea mays, L.) regions of northern China since 1997. No-till seeding of maize after wheat harvest has been achieved with increasing success in these regions and several small–medium-sized no-till maize seeders have been developed for these conditions (Li et al., 2000), but no-till seeding of wheat after maize harvest is still a problem (Gao et al., 2003). No-till wheat seeders, equipped with various kinds of maize residue anti-blocking mechanisms (e. g. strip-choppers, powered <b>cutting</b> <b>discs),</b> were designed to cut through maize stubble (Yao et al. 2009). In annual double-cropping regions of northern China, the strip-till seeder using a powered rotor to till shallow strips ahead of the seed opener is the most widespread option to plant crops into stubble, but with high power consumption and soil disturbance. This approach was shown to reduce soil water storage and retention capacity due to low residue cover on seedbeds (Wei et al., 2005), which does not conform to the principles of conservation agriculture. A power chain unit residue management attachment for a more conventional no-till seeder unit has since been developed to overcome these problems, and this paper reports a comparative evaluation of the powered-chain no-till seeder (PCNTS) and strip till seeder (STS). ...|$|E
