5|$|<b>Confusion</b> is a 1975 studio album by Nigerian Afrobeat {{musician}} Fela Kuti and his Africa 70 band. It was arranged, composed, {{and produced}} by Kuti, who recorded the album after choosing to emphasize his African heritage and nationalism in his music. <b>Confusion</b> is {{a commentary on}} the confused state of post-colonial Lagos and its lack of infrastructure and proper leadership at the time. Kuti's pidgin English lyrics depict difficult conditions in the city, including a frenetic, multilingual trading market and inextricable traffic jams in Lagos' major intersections.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} there was <b>confusion</b> between B.verticillata and B.littoralis (swamp banksia). Until 1984, {{the latter was}} {{circumscribed}} as encompassing what is now Banksia seminuda (river banksia), which has whorled leaves like B.verticillata. Thus {{it was easy to}} perceive B.verticillata as falling within the range of variation of this broadly defined species. The <b>confusion</b> was largely cleared up once B.seminuda was recognised as a distinct taxon.|$|E

40|$|Listeners make {{mistakes}} when communicating under adverse conditions, with overall error rates reasonably well-predicted by existing speech intelligibility metrics. However, a detailed examination of <b>confusions</b> {{made by a}} majority of listeners is more likely to provide insights into processes of normal word recognition. The current study measured the rate at which robust misperceptions occurred for highly-confusable words embedded in noise. In a second experiment, <b>confusions</b> discovered in the first listening test were subjected to a range of manipulations designed to help identify their cause. These experiments reveal that while majority <b>confusions</b> are quite rare, they occur sufficiently often to make large-scale discovery worthwhile. Surprisingly few misperceptions were due solely to energetic masking by the noise, suggesting that speech and noise “react” in complex ways which are not well-described by traditional masking concepts.

5|$|Most {{concurrent}} use proceedings {{result in a}} legal settlement between the parties. Frequently, one party will surrender its {{concurrent use}} claim and instead receive a trademark license from the other party. In other situations, each party may agree to geographic limitations on its use of the mark at issue, which the TTAB will honor if the settlement stipulates to facts which show that no <b>confusion</b> is likely. A benefit of such an agreement is that the parties can agree to terms {{beyond the scope of}} the TTAB's decision, such as specific restrictions on time and place of advertising, or modifications to the appearance of either mark. However, irrespective of the agreement reached, the TTAB must still make an independent finding that no consumer <b>confusion</b> is likely to result from the concurrent use registration. Even if both parties assert that no <b>confusion</b> is likely, the TTAB may still make findings of fact which demonstrate that <b>confusion</b> is likely, and deny registration to the junior user of the mark.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 1945 (when Pius XII {{changed the}} form of ballot to use {{anonymous}} oaths, first carried out in 1958), the sealing wax on the complex type ballots illustrated above {{had the effect of}} making the smoke from burning the ballots either black or white, depending on whether or not damp straw was added. Until the 20th century, sealing wax customarily had beeswax mixed into its composition. The use of wax made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored smoke, as does wax that includes beeswax. In the 1939 conclave there was some <b>confusion</b> over the smoke color, which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave. This explains the <b>confusion</b> over the color of the smoke in the 1958 Papal conclave, caused by the lack of sealing wax on the ballots. The Siri thesis was based on the <b>confusion</b> over the smoke color {{on the first day of}} that conclave.|$|E
5|$|The mildest form of hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{is difficult to}} detect clinically, but may be demonstrated on neuropsychological testing. It is experienced as forgetfulness, mild <b>confusion,</b> and irritability. The first stage of {{hepatic encephalopathy}} is characterised by an inverted sleep-wake pattern (sleeping by day, being awake at night). The second stage is marked by lethargy and personality changes. The third stage is marked by worsened <b>confusion.</b> The fourth stage {{is marked by a}} progression to coma.|$|E
5|$|This counter-punch drove Murat to {{seek the}} cover of allied Württemberger infantry. Barclay's reinforcements, however, were sent into the fray only to be torn to pieces by French artillery, leaving Friant's Division {{in control of the}} Russian forward {{position}} at 11:30. Dust, smoke, <b>confusion,</b> and exhaustion all combined to keep the French commanders on the field (Davout, Ney, and Murat) from comprehending that all the Russians before them had fallen back, were in <b>confusion,</b> and ripe for the taking.|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{research}} has investigated how first language influences {{the perception of}} foreign sounds. The present study focuses on the perception of voiceless English fricatives by Japanese listeners with advanced and intermediate level English proficiency, and compares their results with that of English native listeners. Listeners identified consonants embedded in /a _ _ a / in quiet, multi-speaker babble and white noise (SNR= 0 dB). Results revealed that intermediate level learners scored the lowest among all listener groups, and /th/-/s / <b>confusions</b> were unique to Japanese listeners. <b>Confusions</b> of /th/-/f / were observed among all listener groups, which suggest that those phoneme <b>confusions</b> may be universal...|$|R
