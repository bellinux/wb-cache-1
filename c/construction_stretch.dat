50|$|Endless winding rope {{is made by}} winding single {{strands of}} {{high-performance}} yarns around two end terminations until the desired break strength or stiffness has been reached. This type of rope (often specified as cable to {{make the difference between}} a braided or twined construction) has the advantage of having no <b>construction</b> <b>stretch</b> {{as is the case with}} above constructions. Endless winding is pioneered by SmartRigging and FibreMax.|$|E
50|$|Spiral strand is {{slightly}} weaker than locked coil strand. Steel spiral strand cables have a Young's modulus, E of 150±10 kN/mm² (or 150±10 GPa) {{and come in}} sizes from 3 to 90 mm diameter. Spiral strand suffers from <b>construction</b> <b>stretch,</b> where the strands compact when the cable is loaded. This is normally removed by pre-stretching the cable and cycling the load up and down to 45% of the ultimate tensile load.|$|E
50|$|Of {{the portion}} {{that ended up}} on Polish territory, only a 29.2 km stretch east from the Oder-Neisse line border with Germany was fully {{completed}} as a dual-carriageway autobahn (in 1936-1937 (http://www.autobahn-online.de/ausserdeutschestrecken.html). Most of this stretch became the A6 of today, the rest is signed as the S3 express road. Further to the east, for another 30 km, one finds a partially completed, single-lane motorway, signed as voivodeship road 142 (part {{of it has been}} reconstructed as an emergency military road airstrip). Further east the road is no longer passable, but the earthworks left from the motorway <b>construction</b> <b>stretch</b> for about 100 km more, and are easily visible on satellite photographs. While not part of the A6 in any formal sense, another part of Berlin-Königsberg autobahn was the single carriageway section east of Elbląg (Elbing), built in pre-war East Prussia and now in Poland and Russia. That stretch had been rebuilt and was opened to traffic in 2008 as express road S22.|$|E

50|$|This mosque was {{the first}} to be {{constructed}} in the new Isfahan, before the grand mosque of the Shah. Its <b>construction</b> <b>stretched</b> over sixteen long years, but two dates (1616 on the dome and 1618 ni the mihrab) tend to show that it was completed around 1618. The architect was Muhammad Riza ibn Husayn, and the calligrapher possibly Reza Abbasi, a great Persian painter and calligrapher.|$|R
50|$|The idea of {{creating}} a factory in production of steam turbines in Ukraine arose soon after World War II. On July 9, 1946 the Soviet government adopted a decision on establishing of the factory in Mykolaiv, while the city authorities found {{a spot in the}} southeastern suburbs of the city near a military airfield Kulbakine. The preparatory works started out in March 1948, while the <b>construction</b> <b>stretched</b> out for the next five years. Initially the factory was called the Southern Turbine Plant.|$|R

50|$|The Lautners chose a {{prominent}} cliff overlooking Lake Superior {{on which to}} position their cabin. They began construction in 1923, using spruce logs cut nearby and skidded up the incline. The construction was done primarily by John Lautner and his son, John Lautner, Jr., with occasional help from some of Lautner's students. John Jr.'s early experience with construction and design of the Midgaard cabin heavily influenced his understanding of craftmanship and later architectural work. <b>Construction</b> <b>stretched</b> over several years, and was completed in 1927.|$|R

25|$|In such examples, the plurals {{are formed}} with an s {{that does not}} occur at the end: e.g., attorneys-general. A problem {{therefore}} arises with the possessive plurals of these compounds. Sources that rule on the matter appear to favour the following forms, {{in which there is}} both an s added to form the plural, and a separate s added for the possessive: the attorneys-general’s husbands; successive Ministers for Justice’s interventions; their fathers-in-law’s new wives. Because these <b>constructions</b> <b>stretch</b> the resources of punctuation beyond comfort, in practice they are normally reworded: interventions by successive Ministers for Justice.|$|R

5000|$|The Grateful Dead were contractually {{obligated to}} record another studio album {{before they could}} release live material. As with the {{previous}} two albums, they used an outside producer, per an agreement with Clive Davis, and {{in the hope of}} a more mainstream production with greater commercial potential (and perhaps a hit single). Davis sent British producer Gary Lyons, who was known for his success with Foreigner's debut album. With track <b>construction</b> <b>stretching</b> past a couple months, Lyons simultaneously began working with Aerosmith, taking over the production of Night in the Ruts.

2500|$|The Polar Line ( [...] , [...] ) is an {{incomplete}} and abandoned railway line which had run northwards from Fauske, Norway, to Narvik and, if finished, ultimately {{would have run}} [...] to Kirkenes. The railway was constructed by the Wehrmacht in occupied Norway during the Second World War as part of Festung Norwegen. At Fauske, the line would connect with the Nordland Line, with <b>construction</b> <b>stretching</b> {{as far north as}} Drag, Tysfjord. After the war, the plans were abandoned by Norwegian authorities, although they were from the 1970s revitalized as part of the proposed Northern Norway Line. Some tunnels and bridges remain, and part of the route has been used to build European Road E6.|$|R
50|$|The Convention Center District is {{situated}} {{to the east}} of the Downtown Core and is anchored by the Spokane Convention Center and INB Performing Arts Center. Its location is directly adjacent to Riverfront Park; an advantage that has been embraced through careful planning and architectural design of buildings in the district which allows the buildings to interface with the park, the river, and recreational trails (including the Centennial Trail) that run along it. The district was born out of Expo '74, which developed the original structure that ultimately became the INB Performing Arts Center and the Spokane Convention Center. The convention center has been expanded several times since its original <b>construction,</b> <b>stretching</b> the bounds of the district farther east, where it ties into the University District.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of all these processes, large numbers of memorials, more than for any other conflict, were built across the world during the inter-war period. It is {{estimated}} that France built around 176,000 war memorials, including around 36,000 in the local communes. Most of the local commune memorials were built by 1922, but those in the towns and cities typically required more protracted negotiations, and their <b>construction</b> <b>stretched</b> into the 1930s. The 1920s were particularly busy for construction of memorials in Britain, although the trend tailed off in 1930s, with the last inter-war memorial unveiled at the town of Mumbles in 1939. The commissioning of Australian war memorials similarly reduced after the mid-1920s. Over 3,500 Romanian memorials were erected. Many German memorials were built during the 1930s. Russia was unusual in building very few war memorials to the events of World War I, mainly as {{a result of}} the devastation of the Civil War and the political views of the subsequent Bolshevik government.|$|R
2500|$|... “There {{was a large}} {{resident}} population at the site, a number of specialists not dedicated to food production, and political, religious, economic, and/or military relations with other sites within its area of influence.” [...] Unfortunately, few, if any, of the residential structures surrounding the large centers of the city have survived. The {{main part of the}} site is a complex of clay <b>constructions</b> <b>stretched</b> out for [...] in a north-south direction, although the site is oriented 8° west of north. The urbanized zone may have covered an area as large of 2km2. This particular site layout is the way the city was from 600 – 400 BCE, which is when the final Olmec occupation occurred. This site is particularly fascinating because of its layout—not only does Complex A face within 8 degrees of true North, but the east and west sides of the site are almost identical, showing bilateral symmetry. This is perhaps related to religion (it’s fairly speculative, at this point) but it certainly shows a high level of sophistication and city-planning.|$|R
50|$|The plan {{to extend}} Line 1 {{in the north}} from Dumdum to Dakshineswar (5.2 km) is under execution. The <b>construction</b> of this <b>stretch</b> started in February 2010. It will be met by the metro line from Barrackpore at Baranagar (12.5 km).|$|R

25|$|Modern slings are {{begun by}} {{plaiting}} the cord for the finger loop {{in the center}} of a double-length set of cords. The cords are then folded to form the finger-loop. The cords are plaited as a single cord to the pocket. The pocket is then plaited, most simply as another pair of cords, or with flat braids or a woven net. The remainder of the sling is plaited as a single cord, and then finished with a knot. Braided <b>construction</b> resists <b>stretching,</b> and therefore produces an accurate sling.|$|R
