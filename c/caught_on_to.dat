Even the Southern Song's contemporary of the Jin dynasty {{to the north}} <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> this trend and issued their own paper money. At the archeological dig at Jehol there was a printing plate found that dated to the year 1214, which produced notes that measured 10cm by 19cm in size and were worth a hundred strings of 80 cash coins. This Jurchen-Jin issued paper money bore a serial number, {{the number of the}} series, and a warning label that counterfeiters would be decapitated, and the denouncer rewarded with three hundred strings of cash.|$|E

25|$|Recently, {{biologists}} came {{to believe}} that striped bass stayed in rivers for long periods of time, with some not returning to sea unless temperature changes forced migration. Once fishermen and biologists <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> rising striped bass populations, many state natural resources departments started stocking striped bass in local lakes. Striped bass still continue to exhibit upstream migrations from freshwater lakes during the spawning period. Landlocked stripers have a hard time reproducing naturally, {{and one of the few}} and most successful rivers they have been documented reproducing successfully is the Coosa River in Alabama and Georgia.|$|E

25|$|Notably, {{it was not}} as if Italians {{had never}} {{migrated}} before, internal migration between North and Southern Italy before unification was common. Northern Italy <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the global industrialization sooner than Southern Italy, therefore it was considered more modern technologically, and tended to be inhabited by the bourgeoisie. Alternatively, rural and agro-intensive Southern Italy was seen as economically backward and was mainly populated by lower class peasantry. Given these disparities, prior to unification (and arguably after) the two sections of Italy, North and South were essentially seen by Italians and other nations as separate countries. So, migrating from one part of Italy to next could be seen as though they were indeed migrating to another country or even continent.|$|E
25|$|With {{funding from}} Edward Butler, Addams opened an art {{exhibition}} and studio space {{as one of}} the first additions to Hull House. On the first floor of the new addition there was a branch of the Chicago Public Library, and the second was the Butler Art Gallery, which featured recreations of famous artwork as well as the work of local artists. Studio space within the art gallery provided both Hull House residents and the entire community with the opportunity to take art classes or to come in and hone their craft whenever they liked. As Hull House grew, and the relationship with the neighborhood deepened, that opportunity became less of a comfort to the poor and more of an outlet of expression and exchange of different cultures and diverse communities. Art and culture was becoming a bigger and more important part of the lives of immigrants within the 19th ward, and soon children <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the trend. These working-class children were offered instruction in all forms and levels of art. Places such as the Butler Art Gallery or the Bowen Country Club often hosted these classes, but more informal lessons would often be taught outdoors. Addams, with the help of Ellen Gates Starr, founded the Chicago Public School Art Society (CPSAS) in response to the positive reaction the art classes for children caused. The CPSAS provided public schools with reproductions of world-renowned pieces of art, hired artists to teach children how to create art, and also took the students on field trips to Chicago's many art museums.|$|E
500|$|In 1904 the Football Association {{dropped its}} rule that players' knickerbockers must cover their knees and teams began wearing them much shorter. They {{became known as}} [...] "knickers", and were {{referred}} to by this term until the 1960s when [...] "shorts" [...] became the preferred term. Initially, almost all teams wore knickers of a contrasting colour to their shirts. In 1909, {{in a bid to}} assist referees in identifying the goalkeeper amongst a ruck of players, the Laws of the Game were amended to state that the goalkeeper must wear a shirt of a different colour to his team-mates. Initially it was specified that goalkeepers' shirts must be either scarlet or royal blue, but when green was added as a third option in 1912 it <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the extent that soon almost every goalkeeper was playing in green. In this period goalkeepers generally wore a heavy woollen garment more akin to a jumper than the shirts worn by outfield players.|$|E

[...] File sharing, college radio airplay, and the rise in popularity of [...] "Galang" [...] and [...] "Sunshowers" [...] in dance clubs and fashion shows made M.I.A. an underground sensation. M.I.A. has been heralded {{as one of the}} first artists to build a large fanbase exclusively via these channels and as someone who could be studied to re-examine the internet's impact on how listeners are exposed to new music. She began uploading her music onto her MySpace account in June 2004. Major record labels <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the popularity of the second song she has written, [...] "Galang", and M.I.A. was eventually signed to XL Recordings in mid-2004. Her debut album, to be titled Arular was finalised by borrowing studio time.|$|E
500|$|Werner Erhard and his est Training {{programs}} and later The Forum have been parodied in films, both directly and through more subtle references. [...] Still in other films {{that did not}} directly intend to parody the subject matter, other reviewers have found elements of the est movement as applied to the genre of fictional self-help films. [...] The 1977 movie Semi-Tough, starring Burt Reynolds, parodied the est training. [...] Bert Convy played [...] "Friedrich Bismark," [...] a caricature of Werner Erhard. [...] Bismark's organization and its training went by the name [...] "B.E.A.T.", which stands for: [...] "Bismark Earthwalk Action Training." [...] In real life, Erhard had a Mercedes Benz with a llicense plate that said [...] "SO WHUT", in the film, Bismark rode in a limousine that said: [...] "BEAT IT". A form of Rolfing was also parodied in the film, and Lotte Lenya's character [...] "Clara Pelf", called PELFING", was described as: [...] "a Rolf like masseuse." [...] The press <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> this satire of Erhard in the film, and gave these sections of the film positive reviews. [...] The Wall Street Journal did not give an overall positive review, but did appreciate the portions where Werner Erhard was parodied: [...] "The movie isn't much - an erratic ramble - But it has some pleasant moments, and a delicious send-up of The self-improvement guru Werner Erhard." [...] The Charlotte Observer praised Bert Convy's portrayal of the self-help guru Frederick Bismark, writing: [...] "Bert Convy is a hilariously smug consciousness-raiser with a more than passing resemblance to EST's Werner Erhard." [...] After the film's release, Bert Convy appeared on The Tonight Show and discussed his experiences when he attended an est training seminar in preparation {{for his role as}} Frederick Bismark. [...] During actual filming on Semi-Tough, Convy received a late-night phone call from actress Valerie Harper, known in Hollywood as a devoted student of Werner Erhard. [...] She related to Convy that Erhard was [...] "pleased" [...] with the role, and she wished him success in the film. [...] However, Convy suspected that her real reason for calling was to subtly pressure him to go easy on his parody of Erhard in the film. However, several EST graduates shunned the film for making fun of the training, its methods, its philosophy, as well as Werner Erhard, himself.|$|E

Hinson did, however, approve of the characterization of the gremlins and their version of [...] "New York, New York."

The Nigerian press was also seen as not adequately covering the attacks in Baga. [...] One expert stated: [...] "Local media <b>caught</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the story only after the BBC's coverage.
