40|$|ADAMTS 13 is an {{essential}} proteolytic enzyme that prevents spontaneous thrombus formation. When an injury {{takes place in a}} blood vessel, the exposed subendothelial collagen is able to attract von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers. Adherence of this multimeric plasma glycoprotein to collagen induces thrombus formation by the recruitment and activation of platelets, which subsequently both limits blood loss and facilitates repair of the injury. This process is highly dependent on the conformation of VWF, which relies {{on the size of the}} multimers. VWF is constitutively expressed as dimers or small multimers by the endothelial cells. Stimulation (e. g. injury) however induces in the release of ultra-large (UL) VWF multimers, which are the most reactive in binding platelets, from the endothelial cells and megakaryocytes. Due to their size, UL-VWF multimers are most prone to flow-induced conformational changes, which expose their hidden platelet binding sites. In the absence of an injury, these UL-VWF multimers are highly dangerous as they are able to induce spontaneous microthrombus formation. Therefore, UL-VWF multimers are cleaved into smaller, less reactive multimers by ADAMTS 13. ADAMTS 13 is a multidomain metalloprotease consisting of a catalytic metalloprotease (M), a disintegrin-like (D), thrombospondin type- 1 repeat (T), cysteine-rich (<b>C),</b> <b>spacer</b> (S), seven additional T and two CUB domains. It is expressed as a constitutive active enzyme by mainly the hepatic stellate cells of the liver. Despite this constitutive activity, flow-dependent conformational changes in VWF also regulate proteolysis of VWF by ADAMTS 13. The intrinsic property of the folded VWF A 2 domain of hiding the ADAMTS 13 cleavage site consequently restricts proteolysis. Depending on the attachment and size of the VWF multimers and the shear rate, a threshold could be reached to unfold the A 2 domain, thereby allowing binding and cleavage by the catalytic amino(N) -terminal (proximal) MDTCS domains. The well-documented binding of MDTCS to the A 2 domain initiates at the spacer domain which recruits the remaining MDTC domains to bind like a molecular zipper to finally cleave VWF. Unraveling the complete mode-of-action of the carboxyl(C) -terminal (distal) T 2 to CUB 2 (T 2 to CUB 2) domains proved to be more challenging. Distal domains were shown to be important in docking of ADAMTS 13 on VWF (with a folded or unfolded A 2 domain) under flow conditions. Ambiguities between different studies did not only illustrate the limited knowledge on the role of the distal domains in ADAMTS 13 function, but did also indicate the existence of additional properties on top of docking onto VWF. Hence, we aimed at further elucidating this complex mode-of-action of the distal domains of ADAMT 13 using the strategy of antigen-specific antibody development (AIM 1). A deficiency in ADAMTS 13 due to autoantibody formation (acquired, ~ 95 % of all cases) or genetic mutations (congenital, ~ 5 % of all cases) leads to the life-threatening microangiopathic disease thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) due to the spontaneous development of VWF-rich microthrombi. TTP is often misdiagnosed and current therapies fail to help 10 to 20 % of all patients. In addition, ~ 30 to 40 % of the TTP patients encounter one or multiple relapses within 10 years after obtaining remission. Hence, in order to improve both treatment and patient care, novel treatment therapies are currently being developed. Suitable animal models are crucial in the further development and validation of novel treatment therapies before they are transferred to the patient level. For congenital TTP, small animal models (mice) have already been developed but still require further investigation. In this thesis, we focused on the availability of animal models for acquired TTP. Previously, our lab reported a large animal model for acquired TTP. Baboons (Papio ursinus) were injected with an inhibitory anti-metalloprotease domain antibody (3 H 9), resulting in the development of TTP symptoms (thrombocytopenia, anemia, presence of schistocytes [fragmented red blood cells], increased lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] activity). Despite the availability of this model and the physiological correlation with the early stages of the acute phase of the disease, this large animal model encounters certain technical (difficulty of high throughput screenings, difficult to handle and house, long gestation time, high maintenance cost …) and ethical limitations. Consequently, a small animal model (e. g. mouse) is required to facilitate both the development and validation of novel treatment strategies for acquired TTP (AIM 2). In this thesis, the powerful technique of antigen-specific antibody development was used to reach the objectives of both aims. A large pool of monoclonal antibodies was developed, directed against either the human ADAMTS 13 variant (hADAMTS 13) and the murine ADAMTS 13 variant (mADAMTS 13). The antibodies directed against hADAMTS 13 were used to further elucidate the interaction of the distal ADAMTS 13 domains with VWF and their functional role (AIM 1), while the antibodies directed against mADAMTS 13 were used to generate a novel mouse model of acquired TTP (AIM 2). The anti-hADAMTS 13 monoclonal antibodies proved to be crucial in the discovery of a new mechanism of ADAMTS 13 activity regulation and consequently in further elucidation of the complex mode-of-action of the distal domains (AIM 1). A large proportion of the antibodies directed against the distal domains of ADAMTS 13 individually increased the proteolytic activity of ADAMTS 13 up to two-fold under both static and shear conditions. Furthermore, a subset of the anti-T 2 -CUB 2 antibodies also increased the binding of ADAMTS 13 to folded VWF up to three-fold. Activation of the functionality of ADAMTS 13 was attributed to conformational changes in ADAMTS 13. We found that the flexible conformation of ADAMTS 13 (mainly annotated to flexible linker regions between the T 2 -CUB 2 domains) enables an interaction between the proximal MDTCS and the distal T 2 -CUB 2 domains. This interaction consequently shields the catalytic proximal domains and thereby negatively regulates the proteolytic activity of ADAMTS 13. Anti-T 2 -CUB 2 antibodies or docking of the distal domains onto VWF abrogates these interactions and allosterically activates ADAMTS 13. Supplemental to docking onto VWF under flow conditions, binding of the distal ADAMTS 13 domains to VWF also results in the formation of circulating ADAMTS 13 -VWF complexes. In this thesis, a specific ELISA that measures the binding capacity of ADAMTS 13 to folded VWF was used to screen the effect of all anti-T 2 -CUB 2 antibodies. This revealed a major role of the T 8 domain in this interaction. Remarkably, additional screening of the anti-MDTCS antibodies in this ELISA revealed specific antibodies inhibiting the interaction of ADAMTS 13 with folded VWF, indicating destabilization of the A 2 domain. The use of specific ADAMTS 13 variants (with mutations in the spacer domain) and VWF variants (with mutations in the A 2 domain) furthermore confirmed the mechanism of ADAMTS 13 -induced destabilization of the A 2 domain. Further in vitro analysis confirmed the crucial role of the distal domains but however indicated that this is a slow process. The anti-mADAMTS 13 monoclonal antibodies proved to be very valuable in the development of a novel small animal model (mouse) for acquired TTP (AIM 2). In vitro screening of the inhibitory effect of this large panel of anti-mADAMTS 13 monoclonal mouse antibodies revealed full inhibition of plasma mADAMTS 13 activity by combining two specific anti-MDTCS antibodies. The intravenous injection of both mouse antibodies achieved an acquired ADAMTS 13 deficiency for at least 7 days in wild type mice (WT, Adamts 13 +/+). In line with the human disease pattern and the congenital TTP mouse models, administration of a secondary trigger (recombinant human VWF [hVWF]) resulted in TTP symptoms (thrombocytopenia, elevated LDH activity …). This novel acquired TTP mouse model is very helpful in the validation of novel treatment therapies for acquired TTP. Regardless of the applicability of these inhibitory antibodies in the validation of novel treatment therapies, these antibodies are also carry great potential in the discovery of novel therapies for acquired TTP (e. g. plasmin) and determination of the role of ADAMTS 13 in other diseases like atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, preeclampsia and cerebral malaria. nrpages: 220 status: publishe...|$|E

Systematic studies on the photophysical properties, thin-film microstructures, and electrical properties of the DPPBTz polymers revealed that upon modification of the branching position, A-D-A n-type dominant semiconductors differently behave compared to D-A p-type dominant semiconductors.

Then, two major approaches were applied to obtain telechelic poly(VDF-co-PMVE) diols as precursors for bis(acrylate) s containing spacers of various lengths between hydroxyl or ester functions and the poly(VDF-co-PMVE) oligomeric chain. The first strategy involved quantitative ethylene end-capping of telechelic diiodo poly(VDF-co-PMVE) copolymer and subsequent hydrolysis to form diols with ethylene <b>spacers</b> (<b>C</b> 2) between -OH moieties and the fluorinated oligomeric chain. The second approach to obtain fluorinated diols involved the radical addition of telechelic diiodo poly(VDF-co-PMVE) copolymer onto allyl alcohol to obtain bis(iodohydrine), the iodine atoms of which were further reduced to yield fluorinated diols (85 % yield) that bear three methylene groups (C 3) as the spacer between -OH moieties and the fluorinated chain. Acryloylation of C 2 diol was optimized for various acrylating agents and catalysts and led to 80 % yield. The acryloylation of C 3 diols was carried out using acryloyl chloride and taking into account the results from C 2 optimization (90 % yields). UV curing of C 2 and C 3 telechelic bis(acrylate) s in the presence of two different photoinitiators (Darocur® 1173 and Irgacure® 819) led to crosslinked films. UV irradiation was performed using two different machines: Fusion UV system Inc., USA and UV-system of Applied Curing Technology Ltd., UK at ETC of DuPont Performance Elastomers, Geneva.

Thermodynamic measurements of nucleotide-analogue-substituted oligonucleotides revealed pairwise-coupling free energies ranging from weak to strong. When coupling free energies were remeasured {{in the background of}} changes at a third site, they remained essentially unchanged even though all of the sites were coupled to each other. This type of coupling, referred to as “direct”, is peculiar to the RNA loop. The data suggest that, for small stable loops, folding of RNA obeys a model with nearest-neighbor interactions, while folding of DNA follows a more concerted process in which the stabilizing interactions are linked through a conformational change. The lesser cooperativity in RNA loops may provide a more robust loop that ca...|$|R
40|$|Gemini {{surfactants}} {{possess a}} structure resembling {{a pair of}} conventional single chain surfactants covalently connected by a spacer. The spacer can vary in length and chemical structure. In this paper, the aggregation behavior of gemini surfactants is examined {{on the basis of}} a free energy model developed by extending our theory for conventional surfactants. Free energy contributions beyond those considered for conventional surfactants arise because of the spacer. They originate from the fact that (a) the spacer shields the hydrophobic core of the aggregate from contact with water, (b) the spacer constrains the distance between the head groups, thus imposing non-unifor-mity in charge distribution at the aggregate surface, (<b>c)</b> the <b>spacer</b> prevents the two linked tails from having a packing conformation inside the micelle identical to that of analogous unlinked single chain surfactants, and (d) the spacer can be partially buried inside the micelle core provided its length and the molecular interactions allow it. Illustrative calculations for gemini surfactants with tail lengths of 5 – 16 carbon atoms and various spacers are discussed here. The spacers considered include the polymethylene chain and a combination of polymethylene chain with NCH 3, O, S, and aromatic groups. The predicted critical micelle concentration (CMC), micelle aggregation number, sphere-to-rod transition parameter (K) and shape of aggregates are compared with available experimental data. A comparative analysis of the magnitude and shape dependence of the individual contributions to the free energy shows that th...|$|R
40|$|Dialkyl succinates show {{a pattern}} of {{alternating}} behavior in their melting points, {{as the number of}} C atoms in the alkane side chain increases, unlike in the dialkyl oxalates Joseph et al. (2011). Acta Cryst. B 67, 525 - 534]. Dialkyl succinates with odd numbers of C atoms in the alkyl side chain show higher melting points than the immediately adjacent analogues with even numbers. The crystal structures and their molecular packing have been analyzed for a series of dialkyl succinates with 1 - 4 C atoms in the alkyl side chain. The energy difference (Delta E) between the optimized and observed molecular conformations, density, Kitaigorodskii packing index (KPI) and C-H center dot center dot center dot O interactions are considered to rationalize this behavior. In contrast to the dialkyl oxalates where a larger number of moderately strong C-H center dot center dot center dot O interactions were characteristic of oxalates with elevated melting points, here the molecular packing and the density {{play a major role in}} raising the melting point. On moving from oxalate to succinate esters the introduction of the <b>C</b> 2 <b>spacer</b> adds two activated H atoms to the asymmetric unit, resulting in the formation of stronger C-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds in all succinates. As a result the crystallinity of long-chain alkyl substituted esters improves enormously in the presence of hydrogen bonds from activated donors...|$|R

The apigenin and alkyl amines moieties of these compounds {{were separated by}} C 2 or <b>C</b> 3 <b>spacers,</b> respectively. The chemical structures of the apigenin derivatives were confirmed using 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR, and electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy. The in vitro antibacterial and antiproliferative activities of all synthesized compounds were determined. Among the tested compounds, 4 a– 4 j displayed significant antibacterial activity against the tested strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Additionally, 4 i showed the best inhibitory activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations of 1. 95, 3. 91, 3. 91, and 3. 91 μg/mL against S. aureus, B. subtilis, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa, respectively. The antiproliferative activity of the apigenin derivatives was evaluated by an MTT [3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] assay. We determined that 4 a– 4 j displayed better growth inhibition activity against four human cancer cell lines, namely, human lung (A 549), human cervical (HeLa), human hepatocellular liver (HepG 2), and human breast (MCF- 7) cancer cells, than the parent apigenin. Compound 4 j {{was found to be}} the most active antiproliferative compound against the selected cancer cells. Structure-activity relationships were also discussed based on the obtained experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Cumulene sp-carbon {{molecular}} wires C 2 [Fc(Ph) CC(Ph) Fc] up to C 7 [Fc(Ph) CCCCCCC(Ph) Fc] endcapped by two electroactive ferrocenyl {{groups are}} presented in this report. Synthetically, ferrocenyl cumulenes can be built-up by a modular strategy using C 1 synthon ferrocenyl(phenyl) ketone as starting material with various acetylenic/propargylic/homopropargylic C 2 −C 5 reagents, taking into account and exploiting the efficient stabilization of an electron-deficient carbenium center by an adjacent ferrocenyl moiety. With increasing cumulene chain length the reactivity of cumulenes increases considerably, indicating steric protection as the main requirement for bulk stability. Even cumulenes C 2, C 4, and C 6 are conjugated “molecular wires” effecting electronic communication between the terminal ferrocenyl substituents, whereas odd cumulenes C 3, C 5, and C 7 are nonconjugated and electronically decoupled due to their orthogonal terminal π-systems. Electrochemically, separate redox waves can be detected up to a <b>C</b> 6 cumulene <b>spacer,</b> but the electronic communication between the endcapping redox-active ferrocenyl substituents decreases with increasing cumulene length...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of soluble supramolecular 3 -D coordination polymers with Nd 3 + and La 3 + {{in aqueous solution}} has been studied for two bifunctional ligands consisting of two pyridine- 2, 6 -dicarboxylate groups connected at the 4 -position by O(CH 2 CH 2 O) 4 and O(CH 2 CH 2 O) 6 <b>spacers</b> (<b>C</b> 4 and C 6, respectively). Viscosity measurements were used to monitor the network formation {{as a function of}} the ligand concentration, and the ratio between metal ions and ligands. For corresponding conditions C 4 solutions with Nd 3 + always gave much higher viscosities than C 6 solutions with Nd 3 +. C 6 is long, and flexible enough to bind with both chelating groups to only one metal ion (ring formation). This causes the polymers to stop growing, resulting in smaller average sizes of the 3 -D polymers. The ring-structures could be demonstrated by 1 H NMR spectroscopy using C 6 and La 3 + at low concentration...|$|R

This paper studies the conventional spacers replacement with edible and biodegradable films made with whey protein isolate (WPI) and potassium sorbate as a preservative. Besides facilitating {{the separation of}} pie caps, with this application is intended to increase their shelf life.  The films made by the compression molding method were used as spacers in pie caps without preservative in their formula (A) and with preservative (B) and they were compared with conventional polyethylene <b>spacers</b> (<b>C).</b> During four months, monthly sensory, microbiological and physicochemical (humidity) evaluations were done on the pie caps, together with humidity and solubility evaluations of the films. None of the samples showed microbiological or sensory deterioration. The sensory attributes showed no or slight difference in study time. Between samples the differences were minor: the best scores were for sample A in color, sample C in flavor, and samples B and C in texture and overall liking. The edible films have an interesting potential for this application, although studies in disguise the flavor of serum should be done...|$|R
40|$|Two novel {{high-molecular}} weight functional polyacetylenes (PA) bearing oxadiazole {{group as}} a pendant, poly(2 -(4 -octoxyphenyl) - 5 -(4 -ethynylphenyl) - 1, 3, 4 -oxadiazole) (PI) and poly(2 -(4 '-octoxyphenyl) - 5 -(4 -propynyloxyphenyl) - 1, 3, 4 -oxadiazole) (P 2) were synthesized by [Rh(nbd) Cl](2) -Et 3 N catalysts. Both polymers were soluble in common organic solvents such as CHCl 3 and tetrahydrofuran. Their structures and properties were characterized and evaluated with FTIR, NMR, UV, thermogravimetric analysis, GPC, optical-limiting and nonlinear optical analyses, respectively. The results show that linkage of oxadiazole chromophore to PA main chain has improved the nonlinear optical (NLO) property of PA, and endowed PA with novel optical limiting properties and enhanced thermal stability. Simultaneously, the optical-limiting and NLO properties of the polymers were sensitive to their molecular structures. P 1 with oxadiazole directly incorporated into PA main chain as a pendant showed better performances and larger third-order nonlinear optical susceptibility than P 2 with oxadiazole incorporated into PA main chain via a <b>spacer.</b> (<b>C)</b> 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of surface glycoengineering for biomaterials and biosensors originates from {{the importance of}} carbohydrate-protein interactions in biological systems. The strategy employed here utilises carbene generated by illumination of diazirine to achieve covalent bonding of carbohydrates. Here, we describe the synthesis of an aryl diazirine containing a disaccharide (lactose). Surface analysis techniques [X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time of flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) ] demonstrate its successful surface immobilisation on polystyrene (PS). Results are compared to those previously obtained with an aryl diazirine containing a monosaccharide (galactose). The biological activity of galactose- or lactose-modified PS samples is studied using rat hepatocytes, Allo A lectin and solid-phase semi-synthesis with alpha - 2, 6 -sialyltransferase. Allo A shows some binding to galactose-modified PS but none to lactose-modified surfaces. Similar results are obtained with rat hepatocytes. In contrast, sialylation of lactose-modified PS is achieved but not with galactose-modified surfaces. The different responses indicate that the biological activity depends {{not only on the}} carbohydrate per se but also on the structure and length of the <b>spacer.</b> (<b>C)</b> 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Polystyrene brushes (Mn 8500 - 66, 400 g/mol) were grown from the alkoxyamine functionalized silicon wafers by nitroxide mediated radical polymerization and characterized by ellipsometry and water contact angle measurements. The main parameters influencing the grafting density {{and the degree}} of stretching of the brushes are the nitroxide polarity and, therefore, the behavior of the corresponding alkoxyamines at the air/water interface of the Langmuir-Blodgett trough. Depending on the alkoxyamine chemical structure and the surface pressure during Langmuir-Blodgett deposition, polystyrene brushes with grafting densities of 0. 3 - 1. 0 chains/nm 2 and stretching values of 40 - 70 % were obtained. Regarding alkoxyamines deposited at high surface pressures, size exclusion chromatography experiments performed on both cleaved polystyrene brushes and chains simultaneously grown in the bulk revealed that the polymerization degree of the bulk and surface chains are significantly different, suggesting that steric constrains affect the polymerization kinetics occurring at the silicon surface...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} cis-cis-triaminocyclohexane Zn(II) complex-anthraquinone {{intercalator}} conjugates, designed {{in such a}} way to allow their easy synthesis and modification, have been investigated as hydrolytic cleaving agents for plasmid DNA. The ligand structure comprises a triaminocyclohexane platform linked by means of alkyl spacers of different length (from C 4 to C 8) to the anthraquinone group which may intercalate the DNA. At a concentration of 5 íM, the complex of the derivative with a <b>C</b> 8 alkyl <b>spacer</b> induces the hydrolytic stand scission of supercoiled DNA with a rate of 4. 6 10 - 6 s- 1 at pH 7 and 37 °C. The conjugation of the metal complex with the anthraquinone group leads to a 15 -fold increase of the cleavage efficiency when compared with the anthraquinone lacking Zn-triaminocyclohexane complex. The straightforward synthetic procedure employed, allowing a systematic change of the spacer length, made possible to gain more insight {{on the role of the}} intercalating group in determining the reactivity of the systems. Comparison of the reactivity of the different complexes shows a remarkable increase of the DNA cleaving efficiency with the length of the spacer. In the case of too-short spacers, the advantages due to the increased DNA affinity are canceled due to the incorrect positioning of the reactive group, thus leading to cleavage inhibition...|$|R
