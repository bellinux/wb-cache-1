Compared to those raised alone, all competing nestlings had lower body mass and weaker competitors experienced reduced survival. However, the stronger competitors appeared to have longer adult breeding tenures and lifespan than those raised alone. We propose that comparisons with competition-free groups, as well as detailed fitness measures across entire lifetimes, are needed to understand the evolution of sibling rivalry and thus individual reproductive strategy in wild systems...|$|E

40|$|Systems {{development}} can occur with a ‘big bang’ model of instant introduction {{on a grand}} scale or systems can evolve in a piecewise progressive fashion with ongoing refinement. The advantage of the evolutionary model is that extended consultation is a realistic driver option, encouraging ‘buy in’ to the process by those involved. The disadvantage is that the process can take a little longer to implement. This paper examines the Thailand On-Line Automated Curriculum System (TOACS) and its development through an evolutionary model. It outlines the history of the TOACS development starting from the initial concept of implementation of a Virtual Campus, a Knowledge Server Network alternative, and describing the factors which influenced its development including the educational environment in the Rajabhat system and their associated goals. The early technical constraints and infrastructure issues are identified, indicating the dependence upon some technical innovation which occurred through following better definition of customer requirements. The success of training programs and the adoption of technology by staff through leadership and recognition of improved educational outcomes was a significant contributing factor. The possibility of national coverage and regional focus are also described as important factors in encouraging staff involvement and eventual adoption. The potential for developing international relationships was an additional factor in the joint development of an online model leading to successful programs, staff in-service and advancement, and eventual adoption and spread of a working online educational environment. The paper outlines the major factors resulting from an analysis of needs and potential outcomes balanced against the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> and infrastructure difficulties and enhancements. The outcome appears to be successful, understanding of the forces driving this evolutionary change will help inform the changes that will inevitably follow in the next decade of educational development...|$|E
40|$|At {{the present}} day, {{software}} systems {{get more and}} more complex. The requirements of software systems change continuously and new requirements emerge frequently. New and/or modified requirements are integrated with the existing ones, and adaptations to the architecture and source code of the system are made. The process of integration of the new/modified requirements and adaptations to the software system is called change management. The size and complexity of software systems make change management costly and time consuming. To reduce the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes,</b> it is important to apply change management as early as possible in the software development cycle. Requirements traceability is considered crucial in change management for establishing and maintaining consistency between software development artifacts. It is the ability to link requirements back to stakeholders’ rationales and forward to corresponding design artifacts, code, and test cases. When changes for the requirements of the software system are proposed, the impact of these changes on other requirements, design elements and source code should be traced in order to determine parts of the software system to be changed. Determining the impact of changes on the parts of development artifacts is called change impact analysis. Change impact analysis is applicable to many development artifacts like requirements documents, detailed design, source code and test cases. Our focus is change impact analysis in requirements and software architecture. The need for change impact analysis is observed in both requirements and software architecture. When a change is introduced to a requirement, the requirements engineer needs to find out if any other requirement related to the changed requirement is impacted. After determining the impacted requirements, the software architect needs to identify the impacted architectural elements by tracing the changed requirements to software architecture. It is hard, expensive and error prone to manually trace impacted requirements and architectural elements from the changed requirements. In this thesis, we introduce methods and tools for application of change impact analysis in requirements and software architecture...|$|E

In Extreme Programming Explained, Beck emphasizes this point. Everything in software changes. The requirements change. The design changes. The technology changes. The team changes. The team members change. The problem isn't change per se, because change is going to happen; the problem, rather, is the inability to cope with change when it comes. [Beck 2000] 2. B. Change is easy.
