25|$|Horse-drawn {{transportation}} {{was most}} important for Germany, as it was relatively lacking in natural oil resources. Infantry and horse-drawn artillery formed {{the bulk of the}} German Army throughout the war; only one-fifth of the Army belonged to mobile panzer and mechanized divisions. Each German infantry division employed thousands of horses and thousands of men taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Despite losses of horses to enemy action, exposure and disease, Germany maintained a steady supply of work and saddle horses until 1945. Cavalry in the Army and the SS gradually increased in size, peaking at six cavalry divisions in February 1945.|$|E

25|$|In the Fairfax Court House action, the Confederate force {{killed at}} least four of the Union troops and wounded or took {{prisoner}} most of the others. The Confederates suffered a similar number of killed and wounded according to the only report on their casualties by a Union sergeant. Some of the badly wounded Union prisoners were paroled {{at the site of}} the battle along with a few men to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Finding the prisoners from the 11th New York Cavalry and from other Union units to be too much of a burden on the march north, Stuart paroled them at Brookeville, Maryland on the night of June 2829.|$|E

However, this will was destroyed by Ada in May 1935, and a new will created that left all the money to Dorothea Waddingham and Ronald Sullivan when Ada and her mother both died (it being in recompense for the nurse's <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them).</b> The elderly Mrs Baguley died in {{the second week of}} May.|$|E

She gallops the horse up the hill and runs into the Germans who then take the horses, breaking Emilie's heart. The grandfather keeps the pennant.|$|E

25|$|Anti-lock brakes are {{the subject}} of some {{experiments}} centred around risk compensation theory, which asserts that drivers adapt to the safety benefit of ABS by driving more aggressively. In a Munich study, half a fleet of taxicabs was equipped with anti-lock brakes, while the other half had conventional brake systems. The crash rate was substantially the same for both types of cab, and Wilde concludes this was due to drivers of ABS-equipped cabs taking more risks, assuming that ABS would take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> while the non-ABS drivers drove more carefully since ABS would not be there to help in case of a dangerous situation.|$|E
25|$|As empress, she is {{particularly}} responsible for Momijiyama Imperial Cocoonery, a sericulture farm {{on the grounds}} of the imperial palace. She participates in the annual ceremony of harvesting silk, personally feeds silkworms with blackberries and is responsible to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> the frames, and the harvesting. The production and harvesting of silk are part of her ceremonial duties, linked to Shintoism, Japanese culture, and tradition. Since 1994, the Empress offers a part of the harvested silk of the koishimaru variety (the oldest species now kept in Japan) to the Shōsōin Treasure-house in the Buddhist temple Tōdai-ji in Nara to be used for the restoration of its treasures.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} way, Stewart centers {{the first half}} of Earth Abides on the forces of natural and {{artificial}} selection. In freeing the landscape from humans, half of the book is devoted to looking at how the world would change in their absence. Stewart chose to make his main human character an ecologist, and sends him on a cross-country tour, to see what the world is like without people. As animals and plants no longer have humans taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> or controlling them, they are free to breed uncontrolled and to prey upon one another. The main character sees that some have been under humans so long that they are helpless in the face of change, while others are still able to adapt and survive. Stewart shows that humans have routinely influenced the lives of almost every plant and animal around them.|$|E

25|$|Imboden's train {{consisted}} {{of hundreds of}} Conestoga-style wagons, which extended 15–20 miles along the narrow roads. Assembling these wagons into a marching column, arranging their escorts, loading supplies, and accounting for the wounded took until late afternoon on July 5. Imboden himself left Cashtown around 8 p.m. to join {{the head of his}} column. The journey was one of extreme misery, conducted during the torrential rains that began on July 4, in which the wounded men were forced to endure the weather and the rough roads in wagons without suspensions. Imboden's orders required that he not stop until he reached his destination, which meant that wagons breaking down were left behind. Some critically wounded men were left behind on the roadsides as well, hoping that local civilians would find and take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> The train was harassed throughout its march. At dawn on July 5, civilians in Greencastle ambushed the train with axes, attacking the wheels of the wagons, until they were driven off. That afternoon at Cunningham's Cross Roads (current day Cearfoss, Maryland), Capt. Abram Jones led 200 troopers of the 1st New York Cavalry and 12th Pennsylvania Cavalry in attacking the column, capturing 134 wagons, 600 horses and mules, and 645 prisoners, about half of whom were wounded. These losses so angered Stuart that he demanded a court of inquiry to investigate.|$|E

Bart gets tricked into taking an etiquette class by a black man dressed as a gangsta rapper, who happens to be the husband of the prim and proper etiquette teacher. Homer participates in a basketball class for men over the age of 35, but suffers a torn ACL after a dunk attempt ends with the backboard crashing down on his leg. After Homer gets his surgery, he is told by Dr. Hibbert that he cannot go to work and must stay home. Homer finds himself extremely bored, even going so far as attempting to cross-breed Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II. One evening, Ned wants Marge to watch Rod and Todd while he attends a Chris Rock concert (that he misinterprets to be an abbreviation for a christian rock concert and after is surprised by the language). But Marge is out identifying the body of her Uncle Lou (which ends up being a very much alive Hans Moleman, although the morgue attendant seems convinced that he is dead), so Ned asks Homer instead. Rod and Todd enjoy having Homer take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> which gives Homer the idea to establish his own day care center.|$|E

An editor writing in The Times of India found a theme of feminine assertiveness in [...] "Cater 2 U"; he noted that [...] "the women come off not so much as lovers as full-service romantic servants". J. Freedom du Lac, a staff writer of The Washington Post wrote that the song's theme was supplication.|$|E

[...] The focus target market for medical tourists in Malta is the United Kingdom, followed by North Africa, the Middle East, Russia and North America.
