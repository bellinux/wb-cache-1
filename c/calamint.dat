60|$|But we {{were most}} {{interested}} {{to hear of}} the pennyroyal, it is soothing {{to be reminded that}} wild nature produces anything ready for the use of man. Men know that something is good. One says that it is yellow-dock, another that it is bitter-sweet, another that it is slippery-elm bark, burdock, catnip, <b>calamint,</b> elicampane, thoroughwort, or pennyroyal. A man may esteem himself happy when that which is his food is also his medicine. There is no kind of herb, but somebody or other says that it is good. I am very glad to hear it. It reminds me of the first chapter of Genesis. But how should they know that it is good? That is the mystery to me. I am always agreeably disappointed; it is incredible that they should have found it out. Since all things are good, men fail at last to distinguish which is the bane, and which the antidote. There are sure to be two prescriptions diametrically opposite. Stuff a cold and starve a cold are but two ways. They are the two practices both always in full blast. Yet you must take advice of the one school as if there was no other. In respect to religion and the healing art, all nations are still in a state of barbarism. In the most civilized countries the priest is still but a Powwow, and the physician a Great Medicine. Consider the deference which is everywhere paid to a doctor's opinion. Nothing more strikingly betrays the credulity of mankind than medicine. Quackery is a thing universal, and universally successful. In this case it becomes literally true that no imposition is too great for the credulity of men. Priests and physicians should never look one another in the face. They have no common ground, nor is there any to mediate between them. When the one comes, the other goes. They could not come together without laughter, or a significant silence, for the one's profession is a satire on the other's, and either's success would be the other's failure. It is wonderful that the physician should ever die, and that the priest should ever live. Why is it that the priest is never called to consult with the physician? Is it because men believe practically that matter is independent of spirit. But what is quackery? It is commonly an attempt to cure the diseases of a man by addressing his body alone. There is need of a physician who shall minister to both soul and body at once, that is, to man. Now he falls between two souls.|$|E

50|$|The {{artichokes}} are cleaned {{with a sharp}} knife, eliminating all {{the hard}} leaves and the thorns with an upward spiral movement. Only a couple of cm of the stem are left: the rest is cleaned, cut in pieces and cooked with the artichokes. The artichokes are plunged for some minutes in water with lemon juice, so that they won't turn brown. Then they are opened {{in the center and}} the choke (present only towards season's end) is removed. In the resulting cavity of each artichoke, is stuffed a mixture of parsley, lesser <b>calamint</b> (in Rome named mentuccia), garlic, salt and pepper. At the end, all the artichokes are put in a deep pan, standing on the stem, enough in number so that they support each other and don't fall. Water and white wine are added, and oil, pepper and salt are sprinkled on them. Then are braised in the covered pan until the liquid has evaporated. One can eat them warm or at room temperature.|$|E

40|$|Plants {{are rich}} in {{bioactive}} compounds, {{some of them have}} important antioxidant properties useful in prevention of the oxidative stress and neurodegenerative diseases, however their medicinal uses are mainly based on traditional beliefs, without scientific evidence [1]. Some studies reported the ethnoveterinary applications of medicinal plants in feeding and nutrition of livestock, suitable to improve the antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [2]. Phytotherapeutical use of essential oils (EOs) gain increasing attention in animal nutrition due to their spasmolytic and diuretic activities [3]. However, further scientific research is therefore needed to use essential oils effectively in feeding of livestock. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate antioxidant and pharmacological properties of EOs and extracts of two aromatic plants from Alentejo, Calamintha nepeta (L.)

Anti-ulcer activity was evaluated by measuring the ulcer index, gastric content, total acidity, and pH of gastric fluid. Calamintha officinalis Moench, dose dependently decreased gastric content, total acidity, ulcer index and increased pH of gastric fluid in pylorus ligation ulcer model. In Diclofenac sodium induced ulcer models, all the doses of Calamintha officinalis Moench. oil decreased the ulcer index and increased the pH gastric fluid.

40|$|Plants are {{constituted}} for diverse bioactive {{compounds that}} {{are found to be}} important, like antioxidants compounds that are often found in secondary metabolite in plants and are useful in prevention of some diseases (neurodegenerative and others) and oxidative stress [1] In present work we develop a set of studies for evaluation of antioxidant and toxicological properties of essential oils (EOs) and aqueous extracts of some aromatic plants from Alentejo, namely Calamintha nepeta (L.) Savi subsp nepeta (<b>calamint),</b> Rosmarinus officinalis L. (rosemary) and Foeniculum vulgare L. (fennel). EOs were extracted from aerial parts of these plants by hydrodistillation and aquoes extracts were obtained by lyophilization of the corresponding hydrolates [2]. Antioxidant activities were determined by three methods: DPPH radical, -carotene/linoleic acid and reducing power assay. Toxicity of EOs and hydrolates was carried out by the brine shrimp mortality test (LC 50) and evaluation of acute toxicity (DL 50) in mice. Additionally, the serum levels of some enzymes as biomarkers of liver and kidney function (AST, ALT, ALP, -GT, creatinine and bilirubin) were performed...|$|E
40|$|Aromatic plants, an {{important}} source of biologically active products, have been used for a variety of purposes for thousands of years and are recognized by their antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, insecticidal, and antioxidant properties. The use of essential oils (EOs) are increasingly alongside in traditional medicine. Alentejo (southeast of Portugal) is a Mediterranean region rich in aromatic plants, often used by local populations in food preparations. The aim of current study was to evaluate the antimicrobial and toxicological properties of EOs of five aromatic herbs and to correlate with chemical composition. The aromatic plants selected for this study were: Calamintha nepeta (L.) Savi subsp nepeta (<b>calamint),</b> Lavandula stoechas L. subsp luisieri (Rozeira) Rozeira (topped lavender), Mentha spicata L. (spearmint), Rosmarinus officinalis L. (rosemary) and Foeniculum vulgare L. (fennel). EOs were extracted from the aerial parts of plants by hydrodistillation and chemical composition was evaluated by GC-FID. Antimicrobial activity was assessed by solid diffusion disk assay and minimal inhibitory concentration estimation (MIC) against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Enterobactereaceae strains and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and against food spoilage fungi (Aspergillus spp., Fusarium oxysporum and Penicillium spp.) ...|$|E
