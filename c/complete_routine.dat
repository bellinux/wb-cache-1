Impairment is defined as being unable to <b>complete</b> <b>routine</b> tasks whether occupational, academic or social. In acrophobia an impairment of occupation could result from not taking a job solely because of its location at the top floor of a building, or socially not participating in a social event at a theme park. The avoidance aspect is defined as behavior that results in the omission of an aversive event that would otherwise occur with the goal of the preventing anxiety.|$|E

40|$|This project {{provides}} multiple {{benefits for}} students with disabilities to engage in motor and sensory activities in the classroom. It is important for teachers to allow students opportunities to move and experience multimodality learning. Key researchers like Dimatties and Sammons (2003), Hess (2014) and Jensen (2005) state that students need to be taught foundational skills in order to develop a healthy able body, so participation in academics is possible. Standards and individualized education plan goals assisted in the design of a manual with routines that will allow teachers to implement motor and sensory activities. Additionally, teachers will have a schedule to follow and conduct assessments for student progression towards motor skills and academic success. The manual included in this project includes Common Core and California Alternative Performance Assessment standards, Individual Education Plan goals, activities and materials needed to set up a classroom for a daily routine. The purpose of the manual is for teachers to understand how to incorporate engaging motor and sensory activities in a classroom for students who struggle with motor control tasks like balance, eye hand coordination, bilateral movement, and sensory integration.

40|$|Vigabatrin is {{considered}} the drug of choice for infantile spasms and simple and complex partial epilepsy in childhood. Its mechanism of action relies on the irreversible inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transaminase. Since June 1997 several articles have been published reporting visual field constriction in adult patients on vigabatrin therapy. Recently, 7 pediatric patients, 1 on vigabatrin monotherapy and 6 on add-on therapy with visual field constriction have been described. We have observed 30 pediatric patients with epilepsy (14 boys and 16 girls), ages ranging from 4 to 20 years (mean: 11 years and 2 months) treated with vigabatrin for infantile spasms, simple and complex partial epilepsy, who had never complained of ophthalmologic disturbances. Twenty-one patients underwent <b>complete</b> <b>routine</b> ophthalmologic examination (fundus oculi, visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and visual field tests); 9 children (< 6 years old) underwent only fundus examination, because collaboration was lacking. We report on 4 children showing constriction of visual field, prevailing in nasal hemifield. In 1 child, visual abnormalities were stable even 10 months after vigabatrin discontinuation, while in another a greater improvement was observed 5 months after discontinuation. The possible mechanisms have been discussed and the cone dysfunction, connected with GABA augmentation in the outer retina, has been outlined.

40|$|The {{debate on}} the {{benefits}} of trust or distrust in groups has generated a substantial amount of research that points to the positive aspects of trust in groups, and generally characterizes distrust as a negative group phenomenon. Therefore, many researchers and practitioners assume that trust is inherently good and distrust is inherently bad. However, recent counterintuitive evidence obtained from face-to-face (FtF) groups indicates that the opposite might be true; trust can prove detrimental, and distrust instrumental, to decision-making in groups. By extending this argument to virtual teams (VTs), we examined the value of distrust for VTs <b>completing</b> <b>routine</b> and non-routine decision tasks, and showed that the benefits of distrust can extend to short-term VTs. Specifically, VTs seeded with distrust significantly outperformed all control groups in a non-routine decision-making task. In addition, we present quantitative evidence to show that the decision task itself can significantly affect the overall levels of trust/distrust within VTs. In addition to its practical and research implications, the theoretical contribution of our study is that it extends to a group level, and then to a VT setting, a theory of distrust previously tested in the psychology literature in the context of <b>completing</b> non-routine and <b>routine</b> decision tasks at an individual level. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

40|$|Background and objective: Implementing {{preventive}} {{health care}} for young children provides {{the best chance of}} improving health and changing a child's life course. In Australia, despite government support for preventive health care, uptake of preventive services for young children is low. Using Andersen's behavioural model of health-care utilization, we aimed to understand how parents conceptualized their children's preventive health care and how this impacted on access to preventive health-care services. Design: Semi-structured telephone interviews conducted between May and July 2011. Setting and participants: Twenty-eight parents of children aged 3 - 5 years from three diverse socio-economic areas of Melbourne, Australia. Results: Thematic analysis showed parents' access to child preventive health care was determined by birth order of their child, cultural health beliefs, personal health practices, relationship with the health provider and the costs associated with health services. Parents with more than one child placed their own experience ahead of professional expertise, and their younger children were less likely to <b>complete</b> <b>routine</b> preventive health checks. Concerns around developmental delays required validation through family, friends and childcare organizations before presentation to health services. Conclusions: To improve child preventive health requires increased flexibility of services, strengthening of inter-professional relationships and enhancement of parents' knowledge about the importance of preventive health in early childhood. Policies that encourage continuity of care and remove point of service costs will further reduce barriers to preventive care for young children. Recent reforms in Australia's primary health care and the expansion of child preventive health checks into general practice present a timely opportunity for this to occur...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: A {{certain degree}} of {{impaired}} kidney function is related to an increased cardiovascular risk. The cardiovascular protection exerted in the postmenopausal state by the hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is debated. No studies have so far explored the relationship between menopause, renal function and cardiovascular risk profile in healthy menopausal women in relation with HRT. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 362 postmenopausal healthy women with normal albumin excretion rate were recruited and {{divided into two groups}} (HRT+ and HRT-) according to {{the presence or absence of}} HRT. All participants underwent a <b>complete</b> <b>routine</b> biochemical analyses and an echocardiogram. RESULTS: Clinical characteristics of the two groups were similar, but HRT+ showed a significantly higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR; by CKD-EPI formula). Regarding the heart ultrasonography, HRT+ had a significantly lower size of the aortic root and left atrium diameter (p = 0. 038 and p = 0. 012, respectively); no differences were found in the ejection fraction and Left Ventricular Mass Index (LVMI). In the whole study group, eGFR correlated inversely with LVMI and with the size of the aortic root (both p 80 and 80 women, in comparison with < 80, showed a significantly lower LVMI and lower size of aortic bulb, further reduced in the HRT+. CONCLUSION: In a cohort of healthy, drug-naïve, postmenopausal women, HRT seems to positively affect glomerular filtration and is associated with lower values of left ventricular mass and aortic root size, thus offering a further mechanism through female hormones exert cardioprotection...|$|E
40|$|Burning mouth {{syndrome}} (BMS) is {{a distinct}} clinical entity characterized by a chief complaint of unremitting oral burning concomitant with no oral mucosal clinically observable lesions. Numerous causes of this condition have been suggested, including local factors, systemic factors, and psychogenic disorders. A total of 36 consecutive subjects, 32 women and 4 men, complaining of BMS, who had attended the Dental Clinic of the University of Ferrara {{during a period of}} 2 years, was studied. The method of assessment followed closely a strictly co-ordinated management protocol based on conventional guidelines, namely history, clinical examination and special investigations. A detailed history was taken of duration of the condition, site affected, and pattern of burning. The severity and the response to treatment were assessed with a Visual Linear Analogue Scale (VLAS). A full medical history was taken, with regard to xerostomia-inducing drug assumption. The presence and the severity of menopausal symptoms were explored. Inquiries were made on use of mouthwashes. For the denture-wearers, specific questioning was directed to the length of denture-wearing experience, temporal association of the symptom with the wearing of dentures, relationship to burning sensation of any relines or repairs, denture cleaning technique, and use of fixatives. A <b>complete</b> <b>routine</b> intraoral and extraoral examination was performed. The presence of parafunctional habits, such as tongue thrusting, clenching, grinding, lip and cheek biting, was investigated. If dentures were worn, their design and condition were examined.

40|$|Gender, {{along with}} men’s {{alignment}} with the normative masculine identity {{have been identified}} key determinants of medical help seeking for cancer symptoms. Combined these factors influence the self construct and shape individual attitudes, values, beliefs, norms, expectations and thus behaviours regarding health and including when medical help is sought. Socially conditioned from birth and with a need to conform to social expectations, men delay medical help seeking until their pain is unbearable, or they are faced with an inability to <b>complete</b> <b>routine</b> tasks due to the severity of their illness symptoms. This pattern of men’s delayed help seeking contributes to their early mortality from all the leading causes of death, including gender neutral cancers. Lifestyle factors have been identified key determinants of cancer and thus cancer is concentrated in low socio economic areas where factors such as poor nutrition, high obesity and low exercise prevail, as does delayed medical help seeking by men. In considering how best to address men’s delayed help seeking, the source and accuracy of the health information men held was investigated and {{was found to be}} to a large extent, inaccurate. A positive factor identified however was that men do discuss heath issues, informally amongst themselves. With numerous factors influencing men’s medical help seeking, Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory (1979) was identified a suitable framework on which to base this investigation into those social factors that influence men’s medical help seeking. Suggestions are made as to how to use this same framework to effect population behavioural change in this regard, that if successful would see improved treatment outcomes and a reduction in the gender mortality disparity...|$|E
