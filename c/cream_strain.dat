40|$|Canning {{tests were}} carried out on 5 {{mushroom}} strains from 2 flushes of 4 separate crops. Particular attention {{was given to the}} ratio of whole closed canned mushrooms to that of whole closed canned mushrooms plus canned stems and pieces - i. e. total yield. Factors considered in the tests included grading prior to processing, blanching and retort losses, shrinkage in size and mushroom whiteness. Cream and off-white strains had the highest level of open and misshapen mushrooms prior to processing and a brown strain the lowest. Blanching losses, which comprised shrinkage and mushrooms that opened during blanching, ranged from 37. 8 % for the <b>cream</b> <b>strain</b> to 22. 7 % for the brown strain. Values for shrinkage during blanching were similar for the 5 strains with a mean of 19. 2 % loss in weight. Shrinkage during retorting ranged from 15. 0 % for the off-white- 2 strain to 11. 4 % for the <b>cream</b> <b>strain.</b> Strains which showed a relatively low level of shrinkage during blanching had a relatively high shrinkage during retorting and combined shrinkage values for blanching and retorting were similar, ranging from 31. 5 to 34. 0 %. The brown strain gave the highest yield of whole closed canned mushrooms at 54. 8 % and the <b>cream</b> <b>strain</b> the lowest at 45. 0 %. Corresponding yields of canned stems and pieces were 16. 0 and 24. 8 % respectively. Total yield values for all strains were similar, ranging from 69. 7 % to 70. 8 %. Most shrinkage in mushroom size took place during blanching. Colour of the canned mushrooms of the 5 strains was considered acceptable by a sensory panel...|$|E
5000|$|Sogan-dolma, {{which means}} stuffed onions in Turkish (soğan dolması), is a {{traditional}} Bosnian dish, considered the specialty of Mostar. Ingredients include onions, minced beef, rice, oil, tomato purée, paprika, vinegar or sour <b>cream,</b> <b>strained</b> yogurt (locally known as kiselo mlijeko, literally [...] "sour milk"), black pepper, salt and spices.|$|R
50|$|Tokyo Banana Miitsuketa (見ぃつけたっ) {{went on sale}} in 1991. The <b>cream</b> uses <b>strained</b> banana puree. After baking, {{the sponge}} cake is steamed to bring out a soft texture.As of 2016, the yearly sales are roughly 4 billion yen.|$|R
50|$|Earl Grey tea {{is used as}} a {{flavouring}} {{for many}} types of cakes and confectionery, such as chocolates, as well as savoury sauces. For sauces, the flavour is normally created by adding tea bags to the basic stock, boiling {{for a few minutes and}} then discarding the bags. For sweet recipes, loose tea is often added to melted butter or hot <b>cream</b> and <b>strained</b> after the flavour is infused.|$|R
50|$|Dulce de Crema de Coco - Dulce de leche {{cooked in}} a double boiler with water, cream of coconut, and egg yolks. Once the eggs are cooked to a smooth textures the <b>cream</b> is then <b>strain</b> over a pan layered with lady fingers. Once {{finished}} baking the dulce de crema coco is topped with a soft meringue.|$|R
50|$|In Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, and Syria, Labneh {{is made by}} {{straining}} {{the liquid}} out of yogurt until it takes on a consistency similar to a soft cheese. It tastes like tart sour <b>cream</b> or heavy <b>strained</b> yogurt and is a common breakfast dip. It is usually eaten in a fashion similar to hummus, spread on a plate and drizzled {{with olive oil and}} often, dried mint. It is also often paired as a dip with the mixed herb blend za'atar.|$|R
50|$|Herrenhausen was a royal property, used as {{a summer}} house, which bred its own strains of {{well-known}} horses for ceremonial use. Cream-colored carriage horses, possibly of Persian extraction, with the distinct Baroque type fashionable for the time, had been bred at Herrenhausen well before George II of Great Britain first brought them to England. Napoleon stole {{a number of the}} Hanoverian creams, and used them to pull his carriage at his coronation. The Hanoverian <b>creams,</b> and a <b>strain</b> of white horses, were sold after Herrenhausen's breeding activities were dissolved in the 1920s.|$|R
50|$|A full or {{strained}} liquid diet {{consists of}} both clear and opaque liquid foods {{with a smooth}} consistency. It includes milk, milkshakes, cocoa, coffee, teas, plain ice cream (ice cream that does not contain pieces of fruit, chocolate, or candy), smooth plain milk or dark chocolate (allowed to melt in the mouth), certain custard desserts, gelatins and puddings absent of coconut or other inclusions or toppings, <b>strained</b> <b>cream</b> soups, fruit nectar with or without pulp, coconut water or coconut milk without pulp or bits of coconut flesh, smooth cooked cereal such as cream of wheat (oatmeal is best avoided due to it having a larger fiber content), butter, and honey.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} thesis was {{to summarise}} the current knowledge about application of probiotic culture of microorganisms into high-fat food matrixes (dairy or non-dairy) and their potential for devolepment of probiotic cookies. Probiotics are defined as living microorganisms which provide specific health benefits when consumed in a certain amount. They could be consumed {{in the form of}} commercially available food with added value or as nutritional supplements. The most common strains of probiotic microorganisms used in food industry are lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Bifidobacterium sp.) Their benefical effects include immunostimulatory, antibiotic, antihypertensive, hypocholesterolemic, anticarcinogenic, anti-allergenic and antidiabetic effects and decrease of lactose intolerance symptoms. As food carriers for probiotic strains of lactic acid bacteria were successfully tested some high-fat dairy or non-dairy matrixes. Non-dairy probiotic carriers with high potential include dressing and chocolate. However, the most common probiotic carriers are dairy products. Traditional are fermented dairy products, especially yogurt, quark and cheese. Increasingly popular are also probiotic ice <b>creams.</b> Probiotic <b>strain</b> Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei LBC 82 was successfully used for production of cream chocolate mousse. Unfortunately, studies which are focused on probiotic cookies development are currently not available. However, based on the available results about high-fat probiotic carriers, it could be presume that suitable matrixes for probiotic cookie filling would be cream, yogurt and fresh cheese. High potential has also chocolate in the form of chocolate chips, filling or glaze...|$|R
40|$|Skin {{whitening}} (bleaching) creams {{are often}} used to deliberately lighten the skin in response to social pressures or {{for the treatment of}} skin pigmentation. Bleaching creams contain varied concentrations of hydroquinone, corticosteroids, ammoniated mercury and kojic acid. Prolonged use of these creams may have deleterious (mutagenic) effect on the genetic material (DNA) of body cells. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the mutagenicity potentials of eight commonly used bleaching creams (Body white, Tura, Maxitone, Movate, Amos white, Top gel, Ultra clair, Fair and white), using the modified Ames test (with and without metabolic activation) that uses the wild type Escherichia coli (0157 :H 7) as tester strain. The assay was examined for revertant strains of the organism with at least three alterations in the phenotypic characteristics of the wild type organism. Results obtained showed that the eight bleaching <b>creams</b> produced revertant <b>strains</b> of the organism with alteration in more than three of its phenotypic characteristics and compared favourably with the standard mutagen (ethidium bromide), which produced the same effect. Three mutation mechanisms (forward, backward and silent mutations) were identified. The introduction of liver enzymes (S 9 mix) made no significant difference in the number of characteristics altered (p> 0. 05). The results of this study revealed that the eight bleaching creams were mutagenic in bacteria and could be said to possess carcinogenic potentials. Their mechanism of mutagenesis could also be by intercalation just as ethidium bromide...|$|R
