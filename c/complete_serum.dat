In serum-deprived fibroblasts, which exhibit a low free calcium ion concentration, a majority of the fluorescent analog of calmodulin remained unbound (fraction bound, fB < 10 %). However, upon stimulation of the serum- deprived cells with <b>complete</b> <b>serum,</b> calmodulin binding (maximum fB approximately 95 %) was directly correlated with the time course of the elevation and decline of the free calcium ion concentration, while the contraction of stress fibers continued for an hour or more. Calmodulin binding was also elevated in the leading lamellae of fibroblasts (maximum FB approximately 50 %) during the lamellar contraction phase of wound healing and was spatially correlated with the contraction of transverse fibers containing myosin II. Highly polarized and motile fibroblasts exhibited the highest anisotropy (calmodulin binding) in the retracting tails and in association with contracting transverse fibers in the cortex of the cell. These results suggest that local activation of myosin II-based contractions involves the local binding of calmodulin to target proteins.

40|$|Because blood {{interacts with}} almost all tissues of the body, {{it is likely}} that changes in the overall health of an {{organism}} will be reflected in the quantities of specific serum peptides and proteins, making them biomarkers. Due to the complexity of serum, pre-analytical sample simplification and separation are needed prior to mass spectrometric analysis. Use of a reverse-phase capillary column coupled to a mass spectrometer allows for separation and analysis of serum as part of efforts to discover biomarkers. Even after sample simplification by organic solvent precipitation, data files for a single sample typically exceed one gigabyte, making it difficult to analyze <b>complete</b> <b>serum</b> mass spectrometry profiles with currently available software. However, with adequate safeguards, it appears possible to consider portions of mass spectra to find differences in peak intensities between clinical comparison groups visually. To facilitate this, the elution profile was divided into 2 -min intervals in which mass spectrometry data were averaged. This required that molecular species had defined reproducible elution times. Given liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry variation, misalignment of elution times of individual peaks occurred often. Hence, internal time controls were identified within each window and used for elution time normalization. This significantly reduced variability in data.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The "cotton fur" (CF) {{condition}} in mink {{has been shown}} through investigations at Oregon State University to have three basic causes, viz. : 1) Feeding diets of fish comprising certain species of the cod family, including: Pacific hake, Atlantic whiting and Alaskan pollock; 2) Inclusion of rancid fats in the diet; and 3) Genetic susceptibility of particular strains. This thesis investigates further the cause of CF {{as it relates to}} the third factor. Experiments were conducted in two areas and involved, first, a study of iron absorption using ⁵⁹Fe as a tracer in an attempt to determine if genetically susceptible, CF mink are able to absorb adequate dietary iron in a normal manner, and secondly, a study of the iron transport system by electrophoretic separation of the iron carrying proteins (transferring) to determine whether the CF mink differs from normal animals. Iron balance trials conducted at the Oregon State University Radiation Center were designed to investigate possible differences in gastro-intestinal absorption of ferrous iron between mink with an inherent proclivity to CF and normal animals. General methods for these trials followed those used by Bailey (1967). After a single dose of ⁵⁹ferrous sulfate was administered via stomach tube, total urine and fecal samples were collected for a period of seven days. Each sample was weighed, subsampled when necessary and counted to a standard error of one percent with an auto-gamma, deep-well, solid scintillation counter. Three milliliter blood samples were withdrawn from the unanesthetized mink by cardiac puncture periodically after isotope administration and mixed with an anticoagulant. Radioactivity of the whole blood was measured by counting a weighed one milliliter sample. From the remaining whole blood the hematocrit level was determined and the plasma thus separated, was weighed and radioactivity measured. Radioactivity of erythrocytes was calculated from these data. Technical problems encountered in the first two iron absorption trials indicated that presence of food in the gastro-intestinal tract prior to stomach tubing increased absorption possibly by acting to slow passage of the administered isotope. The presence of thiaminase in the fish component of the diet complicated the second trial and injections of thiamine were administered for the final trial. Although absorption was minimal it was concluded that under the conditions of these experiments the anemic CF mink absorbs iron equally as well as its normal counterparts. ⁵⁹Fe absorption followed the pattern expected of normal animals. To establish more definite conclusions about the absorption and metabolism of iron by the CF as compared to the normal mink would require subsequent trials. It was theorized that polymorphism of blood serum transferrins could conceivably account for the iron deficiency anemia observed in CF animals; therefore, the second phase of investigation of this abnormality involved electrophoretic study of these proteins. The disc electrophoresis apparatus and procedures used were patterned from those suggested by Davis (1964) for determining serum types in humans. A polyacrylamide-gel column, formed in a glass tube was composed of three layers: i. e. (1) a large-pore gel containing the serum sample in which electrophoretic concentration of the sample proteins was initiated; (2) a large-pore (spacer) gel in which electrophoretic concentration of the sample proteins was completed; and (3) a small-pore gel in which electrophoretic separation took place. Blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture as before and centrifuged to separate the serum. Three micro-liters of serum were placed in each column of the disc electrophoresis apparatus. A <b>complete</b> <b>serum</b> sample and a sample containing only the transferrin protein fraction prepared by following a precipitation technique described by Sutton and Karp (1965) were analyzed for anemic animals of the CF strain; normal mink of the Cr strain; and normal individuals from an unrelated strain. Proteins of the <b>complete</b> <b>serum</b> were stained with amido schwarz dye and compared visually with the corresponding precipitated serum sample from the same animal. Visual examination of complete, mink serum proteins revealed as many as 10 to 14 dark staining bands of varying thickness and intensities. The transferrins of the precipitated, serum, gel sample appeared as two, closely aligned bands usually corresponding to a single, heavy, dark band in the <b>complete</b> <b>serum</b> sample. Heavy concentration of protein in some cases apparently obscured the two bands. Polymorphism of serum transferrins in mink was not revealed in this study. Visual examination of gel samples indicated that the iron-transport proteins of CF mink were like those of the normal animal under the conditions imposed. Results did not conclusively indicate that such variants of protein do not exist, but it was concluded that any effect would be slight and would probably not be responsible for the CF {{condition in}} mink...|$|E

In the present study, an attempt was made to analyze the <b>complete</b> <b>serum</b> lipid profile, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high density lipoprotein (HDL) choleste - rol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol in OSMF and controls.

The complete lipid profile including TC, TG, HDL cholesterol, LDL choles - terol and VLDL cholesterol was analyzed. Results: The serum lipid levels were significantly lower in the patients with OSMF than in the controls. When the values were compared between different disease stages, the maximum reduction of lipids was evident for stage 3 OSMF. From the present results, it is evident that the level of serum lipids decreases with progression of the disea - se. Conclusions: From these findings, it appears that the decrease in the lipid levels may be considered as a useful marker in the early diagnosis of oral premalignant condition like OSMF...|$|E

In addition to gene expression analysis using microarrays, a <b>complete</b> <b>serum</b> chemistry profile and liver and kidney histopathology were performed. We analyzed hepatic gene expression profiles using a supervised learning method (support vector machines; SVMs) to generate classification rules and combined this with recursive feature elimination to improve classification performance and to identify a compact subset of probe sets with potential use as biomarkers. Two different SVM algorithms were tested, and the models obtained were validated with a compound-based external cross-validation approach. Our predictive models were able to discriminate between hepatotoxic and nonhepatotoxic compounds. Furthermore, they predicted the correct class of hepatotoxicant in most cases. We provide an example showing that a predictive model built on transcript profiles from one rat strain can successfully classify profiles from another rat strain. In addition, we demonstrate that the predictive models identify nonresponders and are able to discriminate between gene changes related to pharmacology and toxicity.

The grafting process, the resulting brushes, and the resistance toward biomolecular adsorption are investigated by surface plasmon resonance, quartz crystal microbalance, and atomic force microscopy. We determine both grafting density and thickness independently and use narrow molecular weight distributions which result in well-defined brushes. High density (e. g., 0. 4 coils per nm(2) for 10 kDa) and thick (40 nm for 20 kDa) brushes are readily achieved that suppress adsorption from <b>complete</b> <b>serum</b> (10 × dilution, exposure for 50 min) by up to 99 % on gold (down to 4 ng/cm(2) protein coverage).

The brush heights are in agreement with calculations based on a simple model similar to the de Gennes "strongly stretched" brush, where the height is proportional to molecular weight. This result has so far generally been considered to be possible only for brushes prepared by grafting-from. Our results are consistent with the theory that the brushes act as kinetic barriers rather than efficient prevention of adsorption at equilibrium. We suggest that the free energy barrier for passing the brush depends on both monomer concentration and thickness. The extraordinary simplicity of the method and good inert properties of the brushes should make our results widely applicable in biointerface science...|$|E

It {{has been suggested}} that the absence of ovarian androgen production together with oestrogen treatment-related increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels could be leading to HSDD, due to low levels of biologically available testosterone. This study wishes to document the HSDD prevalence among transsexual women and the possible association to androgen levels. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Transsexual women (n = 62) and a control group of ovulating women (n = 30) participated in this study. Questionnaires measuring sexual desire (sexual desire inventory) and relationship and sexual satisfaction (Maudsley Marital Questionnaire) were <b>completed.</b> <b>Serum</b> levels of total testosterone, LH and SHBG were measured in blood samples obtained at random in transsexual women and in the early follicular phase in ovulating women. Results: The transsexual group had lower levels of total and calculated free testosterone (both P < 0. 001.) than the ovulating women. HSDD was reported in 34 %, of the transsexual and 23 % of the ovulating women (P= 0. 30). Both groups reported similar levels of sexual desire (P= 0. 97).

40|$|Background: The {{notion that}} AP- 2 clathrin adaptor is an {{essential}} component of an endocytic clathrin coat appears to conflict with recent observations that substantial AP- 2 depletion, using RNA interference with synthesis of AP- 2 subunits, fails to block uptake of certain ligands known to internalize through a clathrin-based pathway. Methodology/Principal Findings: We report here the use of in vivo imaging data obtained by spinning-disk confocal microscopy to study the formation of clathrin-coated structures at the plasma membranes of BSC 1 and HeLa cells depleted by RNAi of the clathrin adaptor, AP- 2. Very few clathrin coats continue to assemble after AP- 2 knockdown. Moreover, there is a total absence of clathrin-containing structures completely lacking AP- 2 while all the remaining coats still contain a small amount of AP- 2. These observations suggest that AP- 2 is essential for endocytic coated-pit and coated-vesicle formation. We also find that AP- 2 knockdown strongly inhibits light-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-mediated endocytosis, as long as cells are maintained in <b>complete</b> <b>serum</b> and at 37 uC. If cells are first incubated with LDL at 4 uC, followed by warming, {{there is little or no}} decrease in LDL uptake with respect to control cells.

IRI induced more severe injury in Sca- 1 null kidneys, as assessed by increased expression of Kim- 1 and Ngal, rise in serum creatinine, abnormal pathology, and increased apoptosis of tubular epithelium, and persistent significant renal injury at day 7 post IRI, when recovery of renal function in control animals was nearly <b>complete.</b> <b>Serum</b> creatinine, Kim- 1 and Ngal were slightly but significantly elevated even in uninjured Sca- 1 -/- kidneys. Sca- 1 constitutively bound both TGFβ receptors I and II in cultured normal proximal tubular epithelial cells. Its genetic loss or silencing lead to constitutive TGFβ receptor-mediated activation of canonical Smad signaling {{even in the absence}} of ligand and to KIM- 1 expression in the silenced cells. These studies demonstrate that by normally repressing TGFβ-mediated canonical Smad signaling, Sca- 1 plays an important in renal epithelial cell homeostasis and in recovery of renal function following ischemic acute kidney injury...|$|E
30|$|The {{procedures}} for obtaining and culturing the primary OFTu cells are shown below. Briefly, after the pregnant goat was anesthetized, the abdomen and uterus were surgically opened. The goat embryos were removed in a sterile manner. The turbinate {{parts of the}} embryos were washed in the PBS (pH 7.2) three times. Then, the turbinate parts were {{cut into small pieces}} in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The turbinate parts were digested with trypsin at a concentration of 12.5  g/L at 37  °C for 10  min in a water bath. Then, the digested products were centrifuged at 1000 r/min for 15  min. The cells were collected and added into <b>complete</b> <b>serum</b> containing 10 % fetal bovine. The cell suspension was counted and diluted into 5  ×  105  cells/μL. OFTu cells were cultured in 6 -well plates (400  µL per well) and incubated for 1  h at 37  °C under 5 % CO 2. ORFV was added to the OFTu cells, and the cells were gently shaken for 10  min three times before the liquid was removed. Next, 2  mL of DMEM containing 2 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added to each well. After 72  h, OFTu cells exhibited typical cytopathic effects (CPEs). The cells were then freeze-thawed three times. After centrifugation at 2000 g for 5  min, the supernatants were collected and used for DNA extraction. Goatpox virus, sheeppox virus, and swine pseudorabies virus were propagated in baby hamster kidney cells (BHK- 21) in DMEM containing 10 % heat-inactivated FBS and 1 % antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin and 100  mg/mL streptomycin).|$|E
40|$|Background: Low {{sexual desire}} {{is present in}} 1 / 3 of {{male-to-female}} transsexuals (post-operative male-to-female transsexual persons on estrogen replacement). Several studies report lower endogenous testosterone (T) levels in this group compared to community dwelling women. However, no relationship between T and sexual desire {{has been found in}} male-to-female transsexuals. Considering its role in androgen sensitivity, cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide repeat sequence in the androgen receptor (AR) might modify the relationship between T levels and sexual desire in male-to-female transsexuals. Aim: This study aims to assess the potential contribution of the number of CAG repeats in the association between T and sexual desire in male-to-female transsexuals. Material, subjects, and methods: Thirty-four post-operative male-to-female transsexuals participated in a cross-sectional study. The Sexual Desire Inventory, a questionnaire measuring sexual desire, was <b>completed.</b> <b>Serum</b> levels of total (TT) and free T (FT), DHEA-S, SHBG, and LH were measured in morning blood samples. AR gene CAG repeat length was determined by automated DNA fragment analysis of exon 1 of the AR gene. Results: The CAG repeat length ranged from 14 to 28 with a median of 21. CAG polymorphism was correlated with FT (r= 0. 389; p= 0. 023) but not with TT (r= 0. 191; p= 0. 280). The observed interaction between TT and CAG was significant only for solitary sexual desire (p= 0. 002). The interaction of CAG repeats and FT on sexual desire failed to reach significance. Conclusions: We could not establish that CAG repeat length is a consistent modulating factor in the relationship between TT or FT and sexual desire in male-to-female transsexuals. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective An unknown {{proportion}} of transsexual women (defined as post-operative male-to-female transsexuals on oestrogen replacement) experience hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). It {{has been suggested}} that the absence of ovarian androgen production together with oestrogen treatment-related increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels could be leading to HSDD, due to low levels of biologically available testosterone. This study wishes to document the HSDD prevalence among transsexual women and the possible association to androgen levels. Design Cross-sectional study. Methods Transsexual women (n= 62) and a control group of ovulating women (n= 30) participated in this study. Questionnaires measuring sexual desire (sexual desire inventory) and relationship and sexual satisfaction (Maudsley Marital Questionnaire) were <b>completed.</b> <b>Serum</b> levels of total testosterone, LH and SHBG were measured in blood samples obtained at random in transsexual women and in the early follicular phase in ovulating women. Results The transsexual group had lower levels of total and calculated free testosterone (both P< 0. 001) than the ovulating women. HSDD was reported in 34 % of the transsexual and 23 % of the ovulating women (P= 0. 30). Both groups reported similar levels of sexual desire (P= 0. 97). For transsexual women, no significant correlation was found between sexual desire and total (P= 0. 64) or free testosterone (P= 0. 82). In ovulating women, these correlations were significant (P= 0. 006, resp. P= 0. 003). Conclusions HSDD is reported in one-third of transsexual women. This prevalence is not substantially different from controls, despite markedly lower (free) testosterone levels, which argues against a major role of testosterone in this specific group. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Interleukin (IL) - 33 is a {{cytokine}} of the IL- 1 family, which signals {{through the}} ST 2 receptor. Previous work suggested {{implication of the}} IL- 33 /ST 2 axis in the pathogenesis of human and mouse arthritis. Here, we directly investigated the role of endogenous IL- 33 in K/BxN serum transfer-induced arthritis by using IL- 33 knockout (KO) mice. METHODS: Arthritis was induced by injection of <b>complete</b> K/BxN <b>serum</b> or purified IgG. Disease severity was monitored by clinical and histological scoring. RESULTS: K/BxN serum transfer induced pronounced arthritis with similar incidence and severity in IL- 33 KO and wild-type (WT) mice. In contrast, disease development was significantly reduced in ST 2 KO mice. IL- 33 expression in synovial tissue was comparable in arthritic WT and ST 2 KO mice, and absent in IL- 33 KO mice. Transfer of purified arthritogenic IgG instead of <b>complete</b> K/BxN <b>serum</b> also resulted in similar arthritis severity in IL- 33 KO and WT mice, excluding a contribution of IL- 33 contained in the serum of donor mice to explain this result. We investigated additional potential confounding factors, including purity of genetic background, but the mechanisms underlying reduced arthritis in ST 2 KO mice remained unclear. CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained with IL- 33 KO mice indicate that endogenous IL- 33 is not required {{for the development of}} joint inflammation in K/BxN serum transfer-induced arthritis. On the contrary, arthritis severity was reduced in ST 2 KO mice. This observation might relate to IL- 33 independent effects of ST 2, and/or reveal the existence of confounding variables affecting the severity of joint inflammation in these KO strains...|$|R
