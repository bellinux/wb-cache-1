25|$|Using CAE programs, a {{mechanical}} design team can quickly and cheaply iterate {{the design process}} to develop a product that better meets <b>cost,</b> <b>performance,</b> and other constraints. No physical prototype need be created until the design nears completion, allowing {{hundreds or thousands of}} designs to be evaluated, instead of a relative few. In addition, CAE analysis programs can model complicated physical phenomena which cannot be solved by hand, such as viscoelasticity, complex contact between mating parts, or non-Newtonian flows.|$|E
25|$|The {{product of}} the {{polymerization}} process is unmodified PVC. Before PVC can be made into finished products, it always requires conversion into a compound by the incorporation of additives (but not necessarily all of the following) such as heat stabilizers, UV stabilizers, plasticizers, processing aids, impact modifiers, thermal modifiers, fillers, flame retardants, biocides, blowing agents and smoke suppressors, and, optionally, pigments. The choice of additives used for the PVC finished product {{is controlled by the}} <b>cost</b> <b>performance</b> requirements of the end use specification (underground pipe, window frames, intravenous tubing and flooring all have very different ingredients to suit their performance requirements). Previously, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were added to certain PVC products as flame retardants and stabilizers.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Department of Energy’s 2008 report 20% Wind Energy by 2030 envisioned {{that wind}} power could supply 20% of all U.S. {{electric}} power, {{which included a}} contribution of 4% to the nation’s total electric power from offshore wind power. In order to achieve this, however, significant advances in <b>cost,</b> <b>performance</b> and reliability are needed, based on a 2011 report from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government, supported by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future. Obtaining 20% from wind requires about 305 GW of wind turbines, an increase of 16 GW/year after 2018, or an average increase of 14.6%/year, and transmission line improvements. Analysts estimate around 25 GW of added US wind power in 2016-18, depending on the Clean Power Plan and PTC extensions. After the current PTC phase-out in 2021, additional wind power capacity {{is expected to be}} around 5 GW per year.|$|E

2500|$|Hydrogen {{has been}} {{called one of the}} least {{efficient}} and most expensive possible replacements for gasoline (petrol) in terms of reducing greenhouse gases; other technologies may be less expensive and more quickly implemented. [...] A comprehensive study of hydrogen in transportation applications has found that [...] "there are major hurdles on the path to achieving the vision of the hydrogen economy; the path will not be simple or straightforward". Although Ford Motor Company and French Renault-Nissan cancelled their hydrogen car R efforts in 2008 and 2009, respectively, they signed a 2009 letter of intent with the other manufacturers and Now GMBH in September 2009 supporting the commercial introduction of FCVs by 2015. [...] A study by The Carbon Trust for the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change suggests that hydrogen technologies have the potential to deliver UK transport with near-zero emissions whilst reducing dependence on imported oil and curtailment of renewable generation.
