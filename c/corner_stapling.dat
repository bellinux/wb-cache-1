50|$|<b>Staples</b> <b>Corner</b> is a {{major road}} {{junction}} in London, United Kingdom.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Staples</b> <b>Corner</b> (A406 and A5), Dollis Hill, Greater London, has the {{roundabout}} on the ground.|$|R
2500|$|... 11 April 1992: a large IRA car-bomb {{exploded}} at <b>Staples</b> <b>Corner</b> in London causing {{serious damage}} to buildings and nearby roads.|$|R
50|$|<b>Staples</b> <b>Corner</b> {{is named}} after the Staples Mattress factory, which was at the road {{junction}} from 1926 to 1986. Harold Heal commissioned the designing and building of the factory.|$|R
50|$|The {{village of}} Freshford {{includes}} the smaller hamlets of Friary, Sharpstone, Park <b>Corner,</b> Woodside and <b>Staples</b> Hill, which {{are separated from}} the village centre by a few hundred metres of open fields.|$|R
50|$|In 1993 Dixons bought Vision Technology Group (VTG), {{operating}} under the PC World brand at Croydon, Lakeside Shopping Centre, Brentford and <b>Staples</b> <b>Corner.</b> Later that year the company sold VTG's mail order division, Dixons US Holdings Inc and Supasnaps.|$|R
50|$|It has two linked roundabouts and flyovers, which {{connect the}} A406 North Circular Road with the A5 Edgware Road {{and the start}} of the M1 motorway. Also running through <b>Staples</b> <b>Corner,</b> between the two roundabouts, is the Midland Main Line and Thameslink railway line.|$|R
50|$|The {{format of}} the <b>Staples</b> <b>Corner</b> {{junction}} was modified during the reconstruction works necessitated by the bombings. An additional sliproad onto the M1 from the east was added to remove the need for traffic coming from that direction to travel around the roundabout to access the motorway.|$|R
25|$|The {{final section}} of the M1 was opened to Junction 1 at <b>Staples</b> <b>Corner</b> in 1977. There the {{motorway}} meets the North Circular Road (A406) at a grade separated junction and roundabout. Unrealised plans made in the 1960s {{would have seen the}} motorway continue through the junction on an elevated roadway to end at West Hampstead where it would have met the North Cross Route, the northern {{section of the}} London Motorway Box, a proposed ring of urban motorway around the central area. The layout of the <b>Staples</b> <b>Corner</b> junction was originally built in accordance with these plans although most of the London Ringways Plan had been cancelled by 1973. Around the same time the section between the M10 and Junction 5 was widened from the original two lanes to three.|$|R
50|$|Neasden Recreation Ground is a park of 4.5 ha on the {{southern}} shore of the reservoir. It is mainly grassland with woods, a sports ground and a children's play area. There is access from Aboyne Road and from the North Circular Road, opposite Brook Road and close to <b>Staples</b> <b>Corner.</b>|$|R
50|$|The B&Q DIY store {{damaged by}} the bomb (on {{the site of the}} {{original}} mattress factory) was demolished, and replaced by a branch of Staples office supplies. There is a large retail park at <b>Staples</b> <b>Corner,</b> located between the A5 and the railway line. Close by is the Brent Cross Shopping Centre, named after the A406 and A41 road junction.|$|R
50|$|In early 2008, a {{planning}} application was submitted {{to develop the}} Brent Cross area into a new town centre, {{on both sides of}} the North Circular Road. The <b>Staples</b> <b>Corner</b> junction would be completely redesigned, with no south-bound A5 to west-bound North Circular Road travel, and no east-bound North Circular to south-bound A5 travel possible, except by using new roads at the eastern side of the M1 motorway junction.|$|R
50|$|The road runs north-west from Marble Arch to Edgware on the {{outskirts}} of London. It crosses the Harrow Road and Marylebone Road, passing beneath the Marylebone flyover. The road passes through the areas of Maida Vale, Kilburn and Cricklewood. It then crosses the North Circular Road before West Hendon at <b>Staples</b> <b>Corner.</b> After this, the road continues in the same direction, through the Hyde, Colindale, Burnt Oak, and then reaches Edgware.|$|R
25|$|In September 2017, a {{proposal}} for a new West Orbital Railway from Hounslow to Hendon using the disused Dudding Hill Line could go via a new station at Old Oak Common which would be located at Victoria Road and other new stations at <b>Staples</b> <b>Corner,</b> Harlesden and Old Oak Common Victoria Road. 4 trains per hour would run from Hendon to Hounslow and another service from Hendon to Kew Bridge via Old Oak Common.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Staples</b> <b>Corner</b> {{junction}} {{was built}} in accordance with plans from the 1960s to continue the M1 further south to West Hampstead. These proposals, part of the London Ringways Plan, would have seen a three level junction with the M1 as the middle level crossing above the roundabout on a flyover and passing under the A406 flyover. South of the junction the motorway would have headed through Cricklewood on an elevated roadway to meet the North Cross Route section of the London Motorway Box (Ringway 1) at an elevated Y-shaped junction. Most of the Ringways Plan including the North Cross Route was cancelled in 1973.|$|R
50|$|Between Kilburn High Road and West End Lane a major Y-shaped {{junction}} {{would have}} been constructed where the NCR was to meet the intended end of the M1 motorway. This was originally planned to be continued south of its <b>Staples</b> <b>Corner</b> junction with the North Circular Road (A406) (Ringway 2) along {{the east side of}} the St. Pancras mainline through Cricklewood. The M1 junction {{would have been}} provided with slip roads allowing traffic movements between the M1 and NCR in each direction and the NCR would also have been provided with additional lanes between this junction and a roundabout to have been built at Finchley Road (A41) between Finchley Road Underground station and Finchley Road & Frognal National Rail station.|$|R
50|$|Route 16A {{replaced}} the express route 616 on 31 January 1976, but running between Victoria Station (not Oxford Circus at route 616 had) and Brent Cross via Edgware Road, Cricklewood Broadway and <b>Staples</b> <b>Corner,</b> Monday to Saturdays. The route was changed from one man operation to Routemaster operation {{for a period}} between 1980 and 1987. The route was diverted in 1981 at Marble Arch to serve Oxford Circus once again. In 1991 the evening service ran between Brent Cross and Kilburn Park Station, although by 1994 the route was running between Brent Cross and Oxford Circus Daily (including Sundays) Shopping Hours. On 10 October 1997, the route was withdrawn, being partly replaced by new route 189, running via Abbey Road and Baker Street.|$|R
50|$|In April 2008, TJX {{launched}} the HomeSense brand in the United Kingdom. The first store to open was in Poole, {{and this was}} closely followed by stores in Cardiff, Bristol, Gloucester, Northampton and Manchester followed by Thurrock in October 2008 and Cambridge in March 2009. By the end of 2009 HomeSense are operating 14 stores and have opened an additional 6 stores between August and November in Worcester, Birmingham, Preston, Romford, <b>Staples</b> <b>Corner</b> (London) and Nottingham. HomeSense have plans for approx 150 stores in the UK & Ireland over the next 5-7 years, and has alluded to expansion in continental Europe in the future. In 2010 HomeSense plans to open stores in Reading, Chichester, Tunbridge Wells, and Chester. The HomeSense flagship store is located in Westfield Merry Hill, Dudley, England, and opened in May 2010.|$|R
500|$|The A406 runs on {{purpose-built}} road to {{the north}} of Hanger Lane Gyratory, and is referred to as [...] "North Circular Road" [...] on street signs. The road is a six-lane dual carriageway that connects the industrial estates in the area, and passes beneath the main railway line from Euston Station, near Stonebridge Park. Beyond this, there is a junction with IKEA and the Neasden temple to the southeast, and the road runs across empty land past the Welsh Harp Reservoir. Beyond the reservoir, there is a large interchange with the Edgware Road (A5) and junction 1 of the M1 motorway at <b>Staples</b> <b>Corner,</b> and a junction for the Brent Cross Shopping Centre at the Brent Cross Interchange (joining the A41 from Finchley). This section of the North Circular was used for filming the car chasing sequences in Withnail And I.|$|R
5000|$|The Warehouse Leeds, Yorkshire, {{was when}} Soft Cell first {{had a meeting}} with Stevo, who had hitch-hiked to Leeds from London, picked up at <b>Staple</b> <b>Corner</b> by the band Modern English as he was holding a sign saying [...] "Leeds". Marc Almond was {{impressed}} with Stevo, who he is quoted as saying [...] "had the gift of the gab" [...] and was [...] "immensely likeable". Stevo said that he was putting together the Some Bizzare Album, which would include bands that [...] "broke down barriers". He preferred to include undiscovered bands that he could then license to major record companies through his Some Bizzare label. Stevo wanted to include Soft Cell on the Some Bizzare Album, and also wanted to manage the band.After returning to his home in Leeds, Almond discussed the meeting with band mate Dave Ball and sought advice from Tony Mayo (of Naked Lunch), who would also appear on the Some Bizzare album. They decided that working with Stevo is what they wanted. Stevo was only seventeen at the time.|$|R
