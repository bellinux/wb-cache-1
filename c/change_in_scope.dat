However, studies show that rarely projects are complete within stipulated budget. This study is focusing on identification of significant causes affecting construction cost in MARA large projects. This paper presents the results of a questionnaire survey conducted among the personnel of Project Management Consultant (PMC). Data was analyzed with statistical tools to determine the rank of factors affecting construction cost. It is concluded that cash flow and financial difficulties faced by contractors, contractor's poor site management and supervision, inadequate contractor experience, shortage of site workers, incorrect planning and scheduling by contractors are most severe factors while <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>scope</b> of project and frequent design changes are least affecting factors on construction cost.

50|$|Although {{marketed as}} a {{relaunch}} of Speed, Fox Sports 1 was contractually {{considered to be}} a new channel; due to its <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>scope</b> from automotive and motorsports to mainstream sports, Fox was required to reach new deals with providers for them to carry the network. At first, Fox sought a higher carriage fee as well, estimated at 80¢ per subscriber (more than triple the subscriber fee of 23¢ that Speed had commanded; by comparison, ESPN pulls in fees of approximately $5.00 per subscriber, the most expensive fee of any pay television network). Concerns by providers over the increasing costs for cable and satellite services for their customers (largely believed to be partly due to the higher fees commanded by certain sports channels) resulted in Fox backing off charging the 80¢ per subscriber rate, instead charging the same 23¢ rate that those providers paid to carry Speed. For any remaining providers that had not reached a deal to carry Fox Sports 1, Fox planned to offer a version of Speed with limited programming on an interim basis until a deal was reached, in order to fulfill existing contracts that required Fox to provide a motorsports channel.|$|E
5000|$|In 1921, The Cambridge History of English and American Literature {{summarized}} {{the early history}} of the magazine: After the death of Charles Scribner differences arose between the management, and the publishing firm of Charles Scribner’s Sons, which resulted in the withdrawal of the Scribner interests and a change of name to The Century Magazine in 1881. Dr. Holland was to have continued in the editorship, but before the appearance of the first issue of the Century he died, and was succeeded by Richard Watson Gilder, who from the first had been associate editor. The change of name brought no radical <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>scope</b> or policy, and Scribner’s Monthly and the Century constitute virtually an unbroken series from 1870 to the present time.Dr. Holland was a clever editor who knew what the public wanted. From the first he secured well-known contributors of high rank. A [...] "Publisher’s Department," [...] with [...] "A word to our readers," [...] or [...] "A talk with our readers," [...] though relegated to the advertising pages, continued the methods of the old-fashioned personal journalist. Richard Watson Gilder was a man of greater literary ability and finer taste, and though he could hardly have gained initial success for the venture as well as did Holland it is to him that the high rank of the Century is largely due. ...The Century has always given much space to illustrated articles on history. There was something a trifle [...] "journalistic" [...] {{in a series of articles}} on the Civil War by Northern and Southern generals, yet even in these the editorial control was such as to insure a reasonable standard of excellence. The Life of Lincoln by Nicolay and Hay, large parts of which appeared serially in the Century, was of higher grade. In literary criticism E. C. Stedman had, even in the days of Scribner’s Monthly, contributed articles on the American poets. Without neglecting fiction, poetry, and other general literature the magazine has devoted rather more attention than has Harper’s to matters of timely, though not of temporary, interest.|$|E

During this time, the grid has evolved into a robust, production-level infrastructure, in no small part thanks to the extensive monitoring infrastructure which includes testing, visualization and reporting.

40|$|Review {{the driving}} forces {{affecting}} NI edu-cation; Suggest essential curricular components for undergraduate nursing programs seeking to prepare nurses for practice {{in this new}} mil-lennium. Definitions of NI Nursing informatics is a recent specialty within nursing and as a discipline has experienced immense <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>scope</b> and definition {{over the past few}} decades. These changes are the direct result of a proliferation of crucial nursing roles in informatics and of a sustained explosion of tech-nology in healthcare. As the discipline of NI con-tinues to mature, its definition and the educa-tional preparation of nurses will change in tandem to reflect this evolution. Initially, the earliest definitions of NI focused solely on computer literacy or the use of comput-ers in nursing. As a result, undergraduate nursing curricula offered courses to help move students toward achieving a basic level of computer liter-acy. In 1989, however, the classic definition of nursing informatics presented by Graves and Corcoran expanded the description of NI to in-clude a melding of computer science with infor-mation and nursing science [1].

40|$|The {{objective}} of this program {{is to develop a}} system to both monitor the vibration of a bottomhole assembly, and to adjust the properties of an active damper in response to these measured vibrations.

The principal objectives of Phase II are: more extensive laboratory testing, including the evaluation of different feedback algorithms for control of the damper; design and manufacture of a field prototype system; and, testing of the field prototype in drilling laboratories and test wells. Work during this quarter centered on the testing of the rebuilt laboratory prototype and its conversion into a version that will be operable in the drilling tests at TerraTek Laboratories.

40|$|MBA thesisProject {{delays and}} cost overruns are an {{inherent}} {{part of the}} building industry both globally and in South Africa. This paper is predicated on the principles of the iron triangle in project management. The study assumes that an increase or <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>scope,</b> in most cases, is largely to blame for the incumbent time delays and cost overruns. These slippages in both time and cost are therefore established on the belief that scope definition is the primary offending constraint. Continued scope creep suggests that there may be an inherent fault within the core business processes prior to the execution phase of the project life cycle. Further analysis is therefore required to explore the fault within business systems. The exploration and analysis of scope creep within the initial phases of the project life cycle, reveals the current methodologies used by project management firms, which are then assessed against model theories to test any discrepancies. A qualitative, exploratory research methodology was adopted to gather the appropriate data to answer the pertinent research questions. The findings of the study suggest that the level of decomposition, during scope definition, may be inadequately vague for the South African building industry and that the introduction of additional change control measures into the process may add further value...|$|E
