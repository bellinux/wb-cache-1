40|$|Ischemic {{heart disease}} {{has been a}} first-rate problem in the Czech Republic for several years, {{as it is the}} cause of nearly one third of deaths and seriously deteriorates life quality for the same number of people. Cardiovascular disease remains the main health problem of today?s {{population}} despite progress and various kinds of therapy. Selective <b>coronarography</b> is used for quick and highly efficient evaluation of state of coronary arteries today. It is an invasive examination that enables imaging coronary arteries of the heart. <b>Coronarography</b> is still an unbeatable diagnostic as well as treatment method frequently used nowadays. Prognosis of cardiovascular diseases is substantially improving thanks to that. The aim of my thesis was to learn about satisfaction of patients with nursing care after <b>coronarography.</b> I formed the first hypotheses for this aim as follows: patients are satisfied with nursing care after <b>coronarography.</b> I was also trying to find what the preparation of a patient before <b>coronarography</b> in relation to subsequent nursing care was like. Hypothesis No. 2 refers to this aim: Patients rate preparation performed by nurses before <b>coronarography</b> positively. The last aim was to find how nurses adhere to the nursing care standard in patients after <b>coronarography.</b> Research questions were prepared for this aim. The thesis is divided into two parts: a theoretical part describing ischemic heart disease, coronarographic examination and nursing care to patients before and after the intervention; and a practical part including the research itself. This involved the methods of qualitative and quantitative research. The quantitative research results confirmed both the hypotheses. The replies to the questions related to the qualitative research show that cardiology nurses adhere to the nursing care standard in patients after <b>coronarography.</b> Adherence to the treatment standard prevents possible serious complications. The hospitalization time is shortened and the whole restoration process may be substantially shortened. Quality treatment has moreover influence on patient?s satisfaction and good mental condition.

However, published data demonstrating that a prospectively applied screening program improves outcome in asymptomatic diabetic patient are still lacking. AimOur objective {{was to determine if}} patients with SMI+ and <b>coronarography</b> have a better survival than the patients with SMI who did not undergo coronagraphy. Methods and resultsIn our department, we used to screen for SMI in high risk diabetic patients, following international recommendations. All patients benefit of treatment of their risk factors following international guidelines. Since 2000, 913 high risk diabetic patients with normal baseline electrocardiography were evaluated to identify patients with SMI, using myocardial perfusion imaging. SMI prevalence was 18 %. <b>Coronarography</b> was done in 94 patients SMI+. There was no difference regarding risk factors between the group who underwent <b>coronarography</b> and the one who did not. These patients were followed during a mean period of 6, 5 years. Survival analysis was made for univariate analysis, using Kaplan Meyer methods. Covariables with p-value < 0. 15 at log-rank test were introduced in COX multivariate analysis. Significant variables were selectioned for final model selection through STEPWISE, BACKWARD, FORWARD methods. 79 patients died (8, 6 %), mainly from cardiovascular diseases (84 %).

Methods. The sense of coherence scale (SOC- 29) and sociodemographic questionnaires were used to evaluate the condition of the two groups. Results. In group of patients with irrelevant coronary stenoses statistically lower values of sense of comprehension were noticed in the first and the second examination and also statistically lower values of sense of manage were observed, comparing to the group of patients with significant stenoses. The initial value of general coherence was comparable in both groups and did not significantly change in 6 - 9 months after <b>coronarography.</b> The characteristic parameters: lack of social upport, intensity of depressiveness and anxiety before getting information about necessity of <b>coronarography</b> and worse education were connected with lower sense of coherence. Conclusions. The baseline strength of the total sense of coherence was not different between groups. Patients with no significant stenosis of coronary arteries demonstrate a lower sense of comprehensibility before and after the coronary arteriography and lower sense of manageability after the procedure compared to the group of patients with significant atherosclerotic lesions.

40|$|AbstractâThe {{myocardial}} sintigraphy is an {{imaging modality}} which provides functional informations. Whereas, <b>coronarography</b> modality gives useful informations about coronary arteries anatomy. In case of {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD), the <b>coronarography</b> can not determine precisely which moderate lesions (artery reduction between 50 % and 70 %), known as the âgray zoneâ, are haemodynamicaly significant. In this paper, we aim to define {{the relationship between the}} location and the degree of the stenosis in coronary arteries and the observed perfusion on the myocardial scintigraphy. This allows us to model the impact evolution of these stenoses in order to justify a <b>coronarography</b> or to avoid it for patients suspected being in the gray zone. Our approach is decomposed in two steps. The first step consists in modelling a coronary artery bed and stenoses of different location and degree. The second step consists in modelling the left ventricle at stress and at rest using the sphercical harmonics model and myocardial scintigraphic data. We use the spherical harmonics descriptors to analyse left ventricle model deformation between stress and rest which permits us to conclude if ever an ischemia exists and to quantify it.

40|$|Background. Inspite the indisputable {{significance}} of <b>coronarography,</b> {{the implications of}} a revealed stenosis - and how close it is to occlusion could vary in regard to its physiological importance. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) possibility to prove and objectivise the presence of ischemia and myocardial viability within an occlusion found coronarographically is especially significant since it makes possible to the clinician to choose an adequate therapy. Case report. We reported a 43 - year-old male patient who had been hospitalized to another institution due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) of posterolateral localisation. Following the acute AMI stage the ergometric test per Bruce protocole was performed, negative to ischemic heart disease, while multislice computed tomography showed no significant changes on the coronary arteries. The performed one-day-protocole MPS showed a massive area of residual ischemia within myocardial infarction (MI) type culprit lesion of the posterolateral zone starting from the subapical level to the basal cross-section. According to the MPS findings <b>coronarography</b> was indicated due to a revascularisation assessment. The performed <b>coronarography</b> revealed an occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery (CCA) right after the division of obtuse branch (OB) that presented discretely in the distal parts from the homo- and heterocolaterals. The distal portion of CCA presented discretely out off the right coronary artery (RCA). Echocardiography confirmed an ejection fraction of 50 % with hypokinesia of inferior and posterior walls, {{as well as the}} septum, showing a mild reduction of the general contractility. Flows through confluences were well. A month after MI a percutane coronary intervention (PCI) was performed with the implantation of a drug-releasing stent (Taxus).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Tako-tsubo {{cardiomyopathy}} is {{a rapidly}} reversible form of acute heart failure triggered by stressful events that occur {{more frequently in}} postmenopausal women. A central role {{is supposed to be}} played by catecholamines and the association with pheocromocytoma is rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a patient admitted for abdominal pain and suffering of hypertension pharmacologically treated. During hospitalization the patient presented cephalea and precordial pain with nausea and profuse sweating. ECG showed ST elevation and deep negative T wave. Blood tests were moderately elevated. Echo-cardiography reported a left ventricular apex akynesia and hyperkynesia of the base while <b>coronarography</b> was negative. As hypertension persisted the suspicion of pheocromocytoma arose. Urinary and blood catecholamines were mildly elevated and echography and Magnetic Resonance revealed a left adrenal gland mass. The diagnosis of pheocromocytoma was thus confirmed Left laparoscopic adrenalectomy was performed after adequate stabilization and preoperative pharmacological preparation by hydration, a-and f-blockers. Intraoperatively blood pressure was controlled by nitroprussiate, rapid half life beta-blockers (esmolol cloridrate). Post-operative course was uneventful and arterial pressure returned to normal as well as catecholamines values. Patient was discharged on the 5 th post-operative day Five months afterwards the patient had normal arterial pressure without anti-hypertensive therapy and symptom free. CONCLUSION: The case confirmed that tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy could be the first manifestation of tumors secreting catecholamines and that pheocromocytoma should be considered in patients with hypertension and acute stress-induced cardiomiopathy without evidence of acute coronary disease and with negative <b>coronarography...</b>|$|E
40|$|IntroductionDiabetes is an {{independent}} risk factor for morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease, {{in addition to other}} traditional risk factors. The aim of our work is to illustrate the clinical, angiographic and therapeutic management of coronary artery disease in type 2 diabetics. Materials and methodsA retrospective study on 150 patients with type 2 diabetes who have been realized a <b>coronarography</b> and followed by the Department of Endocrinology and Cardiology CHU Ibn Rochd of Casablanca, between January 2009 and January 2010. ResultsAll our patients have type 2 diabetes lasting for 10 years. The mean age was 52 years with female predominance (55 %), the average HbA 1 c is 8. 5 %. Like other cardiovascular risk factors, hypertension is noted in 66. 9 % of cases, a smoking in 35. 83 % of cases, 17. 25 % of obesity cases, hypercholesterolemia in 45 % of cases. The <b>coronarography</b> was performed in 69 % of cases for acute coronary syndrome, assessment of stable angina in 32 % of cases. Two-vessel coronary artery disease was noted in 20 % of patients and Three-vessel disease represented 35 % of cases. Drug-eluting stents were used in 60 % of cases, 10 % of coronary artery bypass graft. We noted six deaths, including 2 postoperative. ConclusionCoronary artery disease is not only more frequent in diabetics; it is also more severe because of the spread and complexity of coronary lesions, with higher rates of thrombosis and restenosis of stents...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The Diagonal Earlobe Crease is {{the first}} extracardiac sign of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), {{associated}} with generalized atherosclerosis. There is controversy about its validity. Objective: Determine signâs prevalence in hospitalized population with very-high cardiovascular risk, of a medical center in the southern area of Santiago-Chile, and recognize its association with CHD and Cerebrovascular Disease (CVD). Method: Case and control study. 304 male patients, â¥ 60 years-old, with personal CHD medical history and hospitalized between May and December of 2012 at El Pino Hospital were included. They were divided in 2 groups, evaluating the presence/absence of DELC by photography. Group 1 : submitted to <b>coronarography</b> with significant obstruction (â¥ 50...|$|E
