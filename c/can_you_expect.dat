Weiner criticized the episode's review by Alessandra Stanley of the New York Times, expressing that the publication revealed too much information. [...] He continued: [...] "I'm kind of powerless. It's the bargain you make. I wanted to have press, and {{it was nice to}} get that kind of space with those pictures. The alternative is not to share these things with the press any more – but how <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> journalists to write about the show if you don’t? It was all very disappointing to me.|$|E
500|$|Both Kanye West and Carlos Mencia responded {{within one}} day of the episode's {{original}} broadcast and said they enjoyed the parodies of themselves, although Kanye West said on his blog that his feelings were hurt. [...] After the episode was broadcast, Mencia wrote on his Twitter feed, [...] "They just made fun of me on South Park. I thought it was hysterical. Catch the rerun." [...] Dave Itzkoff, arts reporter for The New York Times, complimented Mencia for his response. West wrote on his blog, [...] "South Park murdered me last night and it's pretty damn funny. It hurts my feelings but what <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> from South Park!" [...] West thanked the South Park writers in his blog entry and acknowledged {{he has a problem}} with his ego, but said he was trying to change. Parker and Stone said they were extremely surprised by West's reaction, and felt Mencia was treated far more harshly in the episode than West. Parker said, [...] "It was like, dude, we just said you were a gay fish. What are you talking about? It was so dumb." ...|$|E

[...] Carlos Mencia, host of the Comedy Central show Mind of Mencia, was also spoofed in [...] "Fishsticks". He is portrayed as knowingly stealing credit for a joke he did not write, which is a reference to accusations other comedians have made that Mencia plagiarizes jokes from other people. After the episode aired, Mencia wrote on his Twitter feed, [...] "They just made fun of me on South Park. I thought it was hysterical. Catch the rerun." ...|$|E

2500|$|In March 2007, {{during a}} news conference in Staten Island, Bloomberg {{declared}} his strong opposition to legislation proposed in Congress calling for a clear timetable for troop withdrawal.

How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> them to go out and put their lives at risk? I just think that's untenable and that this is not a responsible piece of legislation. It is totally separate of how we're conducting the war. It's totally separate of whether we should have been there. The issue that you asked about is plain and simple: Should the Congress pass a law forcing the president to withdraw troops at a given point in time? I think that is not something that is in the country's interest or in the military's interest." ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{remaining}} competitor was Octave Lapize. In {{the fifth}} stage, Defraye {{had problems with}} his knees, and was more than fifteen minutes behind Lapize. Defraye came back, and kept Lapize one point behind him in the general classification. In the sixth stage, Defraye attacked and only Lapize could follow, as they climbed the major Alp mountains together. Then Defraye punctured, and Lapize won the stage, so Lapize shared the lead with Defraye. In the seventh stage, Defraye punctured again, but {{he came back and}} won the stage. The eighth stage was a flat stage, and the fight was expected to continue in the ninth stage. Before the ninth stage, Lapize was only 2 points behind. During that stage in the Pyrénées, Defraye broke away on the Col de Portet d'Aspet, and Lapize could not follow. Later, Lapize stopped in protest because all the Belgians were riding for Defraye. Lapize said: [...] "How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> me to challenge in such conditions?"

2500|$|Ewell led his corps in the May 1864 Battle of the Wilderness and {{performed}} well, enjoying the rare circumstance of a slight numerical superiority over the Union corps that attacked him. In the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, Lee {{felt compelled to}} lead {{the defense of the}} [...] "Mule Shoe" [...] on May 12 personally because of Ewell's indecision and inaction. At one point Ewell began hysterically berating some of his fleeing soldiers and beating them over the back with his sword. Lee reined in his enraged lieutenant, saying sharply, [...] "General Ewell, you must restrain yourself; how <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> to control these men when you have lost control of yourself? If you cannot repress your excitement, you had better retire." [...] Ewell's behavior on this occasion undoubtedly was the source of a statement made by Lee to his secretary, William Allan, after the war that on May 12 he [...] "found Ewell perfectly prostrated by the misfortune of the morning, and too much overwhelmed to be efficient." [...] In the final combat at Spotsylvania, on May 19, 1864, Ewell ordered an attack on the Union left flank at the Harris Farm, which had little effect beyond delaying Grant for a day, at the cost of 900 casualties, about one-sixth of his remaining force.|$|E
