5|$|A more {{indirect}} {{effect would be}} that the contracted s and p1/2 orbitals shield (take on themselves) the charge of the nucleus more effectively, leaving even less for the outer d and f electrons, which therefore move on larger orbitals. Dubnium is greatly affected by this: unlike the previous group 5 members, its 7s electrons are more difficult to extract from an atom than the 6d electrons, though these energy levels remain <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{subspecies}} of the goldcrest {{have been}} described.

5|$|Many of {{the same}} genera were present across these formations, though they varied at the species level. For example, the Djadochta was {{inhabited}} by Velociraptor mongoliensis, Protoceratops andrewsi, and Pinacosaurus grangeri, while the Bayan Mandahu was home to Velociraptor osmolskae, Protoceratops hellenikorhinus, and Pinacosaurus mephistocephalus. These differences in species composition may be due a natural barrier separating the two formations, which are relatively <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> geographically. However, {{given the lack of}} any known barrier which would cause the specific faunal compositions found in these areas, {{it is more likely that}} those differences indicate a slight time difference.|$|E

5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} was {{formerly}} often treated as the small, pale northern subspecies {{of the rock}} martin, but it is now usually {{considered to be a}} separate species. The changes in size and colour are continuous, so the evidence for separate species is not strong, although some rock martins can weigh {{more than twice as much}} as the smallest subspecies of the pale crag martin. The average weight for P.o.fusciventris is 22.4g (0.79oz) against 10g (0.35oz) for P.o.obsoleta.

The bid included a plan for North Side, Downtown Loop and South Side celebration locations that would have had high-definition LED screens for unticketed visitors. The bid noted {{that there was a}} very high concentration of event locations and training facilities <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and that the majority of event sites were clustered together.

When Elaine, Jerry and George {{go to a party}} of a friend of Elaine, Elaine asks Jerry if it would be uncomfortable for them to live so <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> but Jerry says he does not worry. George's wedding ring plan backfires, as he discovers that wearing the ring is actually causing women who would otherwise date him to reject him. Jerry feels stupid for not telling Elaine the truth, but, the following day, Kramer informs him that he found somebody who is willing to pay $10,000 for the apartment. However, Kramer's friend, a musician, plays loud music all day long, and Jerry regrets not letting Elaine rent the apartment.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scheduling}} {{problems can}} be modeled as a question about finding graph homomorphisms. As an example, one might want to assign workshop courses to time slots in a calendar so that two courses attended by the same student are not too <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in time. The courses form a graph G, with an edge between any two courses that are attended by some common student. The time slots form a graph H, with an edge between any two slots that are distant enough in time. For instance, if one wants a cyclical, weekly schedule, such that each student gets their workshop courses on non-consecutive days, then H would be the complement graph of C7. A graph homomorphism from G to H is then a schedule assigning courses to time slots, as specified. To add a requirement saying that, e.g., no single student has courses on both Friday and Monday, it suffices to remove the corresponding edge from H.|$|E
5|$|Still farther northward in {{the zone}} of the US 38th Infantry the North Koreans were also active. After the North Korean {{breakthrough}} during the night of August 31, Keiser had ordered the 2nd Battalion, 38th Infantry, to move south and help the 23rd Infantry establish a defensive position west of Changnyong. In attempting to do this, the battalion found North Korean troops already on the ridges along the road. They had penetrated to Hill 284 overlooking the 38th Infantry command post. This hill and Hill 209 dominated the rear areas of the regiment. At 06:00 September 3, 300 North Koreans launched an attack from Hill 284 against the 38th Regiment command post. The regimental commander organized a defensive perimeter and requested a bombing strike which was denied him because the enemy target and his defense perimeter were too <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> But the Air Force did deliver rocket and strafing strikes.|$|E
5|$|The {{geographic}} {{distribution of}} malaria within large regions is complex, and malaria-afflicted and malaria-free areas are often found <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Malaria is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions because of rainfall, consistent high temperatures and high humidity, along with stagnant waters in which mosquito larvae readily mature, {{providing them with}} the environment they need for continuous breeding. In drier areas, outbreaks of malaria have been predicted with reasonable accuracy by mapping rainfall. Malaria {{is more common in}} rural areas than in cities. For example, several cities in the Greater Mekong Subregion of Southeast Asia are essentially malaria-free, but the disease is prevalent in many rural regions, including along international borders and forest fringes. In contrast, malaria in Africa is present in both rural and urban areas, though the risk is lower in the larger cities.|$|E

5|$|Extra-pair {{copulation}} with neighbouring birds {{has been}} recorded and may be a reason for adult males {{to stay close to}} the female before and during the egg laying period. Females may sometimes associate with two males and all three help in raising the brood. The typical clutch consists of two eggs which are incubated in turns by both parents. The eggs are brick red with the broad end covered more densely with blotches of red, brown, and black. The parents begin incubating soon after the first egg is laid leading to asynchronous hatching. The first egg hatches after about 42 days. The second chick may hatch three to five days later and a longer delay increases the likelihood that it will die of starvation. In cliffs where the nests are located <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> young birds have been known to clamber over to neighbouring nests to obtain food. In the Spanish population, young fledge and leave the nest after 90 to 110 days. Fledged birds continue to remain dependent on their parents for at least a month.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Ehlers {{collaborated with}} Felix Pirani and Alfred Schild on a constructive-axiomatic {{approach}} to general relativity: {{a way of}} deriving the theory from a minimal set of elementary objects {{and a set of}} axioms specifying these objects' properties. The basic ingredients of their approach are primitive concepts such as event, light ray, particle and freely falling particle. At the outset, spacetime is a mere set of events, without any further structure. They postulated the basic properties of light and freely falling particles as axioms, and with their help constructed the differential topology, conformal structure and, finally, the metric structure of spacetime, that is: the notion of when two events are <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> the role of light rays in linking up events, and a notion of distance between events. Key steps of the construction correspond to idealized measurements, such the standard range finding used in radar. The final step derived Einstein's equations from the weakest possible set of additional axioms. The result is a formulation that clearly identifies the assumptions underlying general relativity.|$|E

5|$|Nemegtomaia is {{estimated}} to have been around 2m (7ft) in length, and to have weighed 40kg (85lb), a size extrapolated from more completely known relatives. As an oviraptorosaur, {{it would have been}} feathered. The neural spines of the neck (cervical) vertebrae were short, and the neural arches had an x-shaped appearance. The middle three of these vertebrae were the largest. The scapula (shoulder blade) appears to have been 185mm (7in) in total length. The humerus (upper arm bone) had a fossa (depression) in a position similar to modern birds, but atypical among oviraptorosaurs, and appears to have been 152mm (6in) long. The radius of the lower arm was straight, oval in cross-section, and may have been 144mm (5in) long. The first finger was relatively large and had a strong ungual (claw bone), and was more massive than the two other fingers. The second finger was slightly longer than the first, and the third finger was the smallest. The upper margin of the ilium of the pelvis was straight, and though both ilia were <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> they were not fused together.

5|$|VV Corvi {{is a close}} spectroscopic binary, its two {{component}} stars orbiting {{each other}} with a period of 1.46 days. Both are yellow-white main-sequence stars of spectral type F5V, though the primary has begun expanding and cooling as it nears the end of its time on the main sequence. The mass ratio of the two stars is 0.775 ± 0.024. A tertiary companion was discovered during the Two Micron All-Sky Survey. W Corvi is an eclipsing binary that varies in brightness from apparent magnitude 11.16 to 12.5 over 9 hours. Its period has increased by 1/4 second over a century. It is an unusual system in that its two stars are very <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> yet have different surface temperatures, and hence thermal transfer is not taking place as expected. SX Corvi is an eclipsing binary that is also a contact binary known as a W Ursae Majoris variable. The two component stars orbit closely enough to each other for mass to have been transferred between them—in this case the secondary having transferred a large amount of mass to the primary. RV Corvi is another eclipsing binary. Its brightness varies from apparent magnitude 8.6 to 9.16 over 18 hours. The system is composed of stars of spectral types F0 and G0, which orbit each other every 0.7473 days.|$|E

Artillery began to fire {{in support of}} the Australians, however it initially fell too far to the rear to be effective, and it had to be adjusted by the B Company forward observer, Captain Jim Ryan, himself under heavy fire. 5 Platoon was still in danger of becoming isolated and O'Brien now suggested he move A Company forward to assist B Company, however this was rejected by Mackay who feared the two companies clashing in the confusion. Meanwhile, O'Halloran called for the APCs to come forward to provide assistance, while the platoon sergeant—Sergeant Mervyn McCullough—guided a section from 6 Platoon forward to reinforce 5 Platoon, and begin evacuating the casualties. Bolstered by reinforcements and with accurate artillery covering fire O'Halloran now felt that he {{was in a position to}} extract his platoon. Yet at that moment two rounds from one of the howitzers fell short, and while one of the shells harmlessly exploded against a tree, the other landed just to the right of the 5 Platoon headquarters, killing two men and wounding eight others, including six of the seven reinforcements from 6 Platoon. Following an urgent radio call from O'Halloran, the artillery ceased fire. Shortly afterwards an RPG round hit the same area, wounding McCullough.|$|E
