5|$|The Puerto Rican {{delegation}} was freely {{elected by}} those eligible to vote (male Caucasian property owners), {{in a rare}} exercise of political openness in the colony. Segundo Ruiz Belvis {{was elected to the}} Junta representing Mayagüez, something that horrified the then governor general of the island. To the frustration of the Puerto Rican delegates, including its leader, José Julián Acosta, the Junta had a majority of Spanish-born delegates, which would vote down almost every measure they suggested. However, Acosta <b>could</b> <b>convince</b> the Junta that abolition could be achieved in Puerto Rico without disrupting the local economy (including its Cuban members, who frowned upon implementing it in Cuba because of its much higher numbers of slave labor). Once he became prime minister in 1870, Castelar did approve an abolition bill, praising the efforts of the Puerto Rico members, sincerely moved by Acosta's arguments.|$|E

25|$|The {{first edition}} of The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce was {{published}} on 1 August 1643, and a revised edition followed on 2 February 1644. A second revision was published in 1645. The work was, according to his nephew Edward Phillips, started from a collection of arguments supporting divorce that would reinforce him emotionally and psychologically while separated from his wife. Although he originally sought only a legal separation from his wife, his research convinced him that he <b>could</b> <b>convince</b> the government to legalise divorce.|$|E
25|$|Git version 2.6.1, {{released}} on 29 September 2015, contained a patch for a security vulnerability (CVE-2015-7545) which allowed arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability was exploitable if an attacker <b>could</b> <b>convince</b> a victim to clone a specific URL, as the arbitrary commands were {{embedded in the}} URL itself. An attacker could use the exploit via a man-in-the-middle attack if the connection was unencrypted, as they could redirect the user to a URL of their choice. Recursive clones were also vulnerable, since they allowed the controller of a repository to specify arbitrary URLs via the gitmodules file.|$|E
25|$|According to Khalidi {{before the}} mid-1930s the notables {{from both the}} al-Husayni and the al-Nashashibi factions acted as though by simply {{continuing}} {{to negotiate with the}} British they <b>could</b> <b>convince</b> them to grant the Palestinians their political rights. The Arab population considered both factions as ineffective in their national struggle, and linked to and dependent on the British administration. Khalidi ascribes the failure of the Palestinian leaders to enroll mass support to their experience during the Ottoman period, when {{they were part of the}} ruling elite and were accustomed to command. The idea of mobilising the masses was thoroughly alien to them.|$|E

25|$|To the {{frustration}} of the Puerto Rican delegates, including their leader José Julián Acosta, the Junta had a majority of mainland Spain-born delegates, which would vote down almost every measure they suggested, including the measure on the abolition of slavery. However, Acosta <b>could</b> <b>convince</b> the Junta that abolition could be achieved in Puerto Rico without disrupting the local economy (including its Cuban members, who frowned upon implementing it in Cuba because of its much higher numbers of slave labor). Emilio Castelar y Ripoll, once he became minister for foreign affairs in 1870, finally approved an abolition bill, praising {{the efforts of the}} Puerto Rican members, sincerely moved by Acosta's arguments.|$|E
25|$|In August 1940 La Rocque began {{actively}} {{to participate}} in the Resistance, transmitting information to the British Secret Intelligence Service via Georges Charaudeau's Réseau Alibi ("Alibi Network"), and forming the Réseau Klan ("Klan Network") in 1942 as a means of coordinating intelligence-gathering activities among PSF members. Nevertheless, he continued to believe that he <b>could</b> <b>convince</b> Pétain to abandon his collaborationist line, to which end he requested, and was granted, three meetings with the Marshal in early 1943. Two days after their last meeting, on 9 March, La Rocque was arrested by the Gestapo during a nationwide roundup of over one hundred PSF leaders. Deported first to Czechoslovakia and later to Austria, he returned to France only in May 1945.|$|E
25|$|In June 1951, Winters was {{recalled}} {{to active}} duty in the Army during the Korean War. He was ordered to join the 11th Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, but he was given six months to report and in this time he traveled to Washington, D.C. to speak to General Anthony McAuliffe, {{in the hope that}} he <b>could</b> <b>convince</b> the Army not to send him to Korea. He explained to McAuliffe that he had seen enough of war and apparently McAuliffe understood his position, but explained that he was needed because of his command experience. Winters then reported to Fort Dix, New Jersey, where he was assigned as a regimental planning and training officer.|$|E

25|$|Lerner's songwriting partner Frederick Loewe had {{expressed}} {{no interest in}} working in Hollywood, so Lerner agreed to write the screenplay only. He and Freed discussed casting; Lerner favored Audrey Hepburn, who had starred in the Broadway production written by Loos, but Freed preferred Leslie Caron, who had co-starred in An American in Paris for him. Both agreed Maurice Chevalier would be ideal for aging boulevardier Honoré Lachaille, and Lerner proposed Dirk Bogarde for Gaston. Lerner agreed to write the lyrics if Freed <b>could</b> <b>convince</b> Bogarde and designer Cecil Beaton to join the project. He decided to approach Loewe once again, and when he suggested they compose the score in Paris, Loewe agreed.|$|E
25|$|The {{occupation}} of the southern departments of Peru (Tacna, Arica and Tarapacá) and the Lynch expedition was proof that the army of Peru no longer possessed the skilled military manpower to defend the country. However, nothing <b>could</b> <b>convince</b> the Peruvian government to sue for peace. The defeated allies not only failed to realize their situation but, despite the empty Bolivian treasury, on June 16, 1880, the Bolivian National Assembly voted to continue the war. On June 11, 1880, a document was signed in Peru declaring {{the creation of the}} United States of Peru-Bolivia. But Piérola continued the struggle. W. Sater states: Had Piérola sued for peace in June 1880, he would have saved countless Peruvian lives and the nation's treasure.|$|E
25|$|Despite a U.S. ban on {{the export}} of helium under the Helium Control Act of 1927, the Germans {{designed}} the airship to use the far safer gas {{in the belief that}} they <b>could</b> <b>convince</b> the US government to license its export. When the designers learned that the National Munitions Control Board would refuse to lift the export ban, they were forced to re-engineer Hindenburg to use hydrogen for lift. Despite the danger of using flammable hydrogen, no alternative lighter-than-air gases could provide sufficient lift. One beneficial side effect of employing hydrogen was that more passenger cabins could be added. The Germans' long history of flying hydrogen-filled passenger airships without a single injury or fatality engendered a widely held belief they had mastered the safe use of hydrogen. Hindenburgs first season performance appeared to demonstrate this.|$|E

25|$|In 995 Olaf Tryggvason became King Olaf I of Norway. Olaf had raided various European {{cities and}} fought in several wars. In 986 however, he (supposedly) met a Christian seer on the Isles of Scilly. As the seer foretold, Olaf was {{attacked}} {{by a group of}} mutineers upon returning to his ships. As soon as he had recovered from his wounds, he let himself be baptized. He then stopped raiding Christian cities and lived in England and Ireland. In 995 he used an opportunity to return to Norway. When he arrived, Haakon Jarl was already facing a revolt, and Olaf Tryggvason <b>could</b> <b>convince</b> the rebels to accept him as their king. Haakon Jarl was later betrayed and killed by his own slave, while he was hiding from the rebels in a pig sty.|$|E
25|$|After Louis's death, {{the rival}} factions of Hungarian nobles {{simultaneously}} elected two kings, John Zápolya (1526–40) and Ferdinand of Habsburg (1526–64). Each claimed sovereignty {{over the entire}} country but lacked sufficient forces to eliminate his rival. Zápolya, a Hungarian who was military governor of Transylvania, was recognized by the sultan and was supported mostly by lesser nobles opposed to new foreign kings. John I's realm also became an Ottoman vassal in 1529 when he swore fealty to the sultan. Ferdinand, the first Habsburg to occupy the Hungarian throne, drew support from magnates in western Hungary who hoped he <b>could</b> <b>convince</b> his brother, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, to expel the Turks. In 1538 George Martinuzzi, Zápolya's adviser, arranged an agreement between the rivals, called the treaty of Nagyvárad, {{that would have made}} Ferdinand sole monarch upon the death of the then-childless Zápolya. The deal collapsed when Zápolya married and fathered a son. Violence erupted, and the Turks seized the opportunity, conquering the city of Buda and then partitioning the country in 1541.|$|E

[...] When they reached the area of those camps they found those militia companies in full retreat away from the gunfire in the distance, and no amount of persuasion <b>could</b> <b>convince</b> the men to turn around. [...] Livingston and Dunn continued riding toward Hubbardton.|$|E

500|$|The {{conscription}} legislation {{introduced the}} right to refuse military service, allowing for conscientious objectors to be absolutely exempted, to perform alternative civilian service, or {{to serve as a}} non-combatant in the army, according {{to the extent to which}} they <b>could</b> <b>convince</b> a Military Service Tribunal of the quality of their objection. Around 16,500 men were recorded as conscientious objectors, with Quakers playing a large role. 4,500 objectors were sent to work on farms to undertake [...] "work of national importance", 7,000 were ordered non-combatant duties as stretcher bearers, but 6,000 were forced into the army, and when they refused orders, they were sent to prison, as in the case of the Richmond Sixteen.|$|E
500|$|On 8 January, Tshombe reappeared in Élisabethville. The {{same day}} Prime Minister Adoula {{received}} a letter from the chiefs of the most prominent Kantangese tribes pledging allegiance to the Congolese government and calling for Tshombe's arrest. Thant, at the urging of the United States, considered making contact with Tshombe to negotiate. Bunche advised against this, saying to the secretary-general, [...] " [...] is maneuvering in every possible way to get some recognition. His position, after all, is only that of a provincial president, and now, for the first time, he is reduced to size. He should be kept there." [...] He shortly thereafter clarified his opinion, stating, [...] "If we <b>could</b> <b>convince</b> [...] that there is no more room for maneuvering and bargaining, and no one to bargain with, he would surrender and the gendarmerie would collapse." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 3, 1984, {{leaders of}} the Council for Better Education asked Combs to {{represent}} them in a legal challenge to Kentucky's school financing system, which it claimed unfairly discriminated against poorer school systems in the state. Combs felt the lawsuit {{would be difficult to}} win and could cause retaliation against his other clients by state government officials. He needed this lawsuit [...] "about like a hog needs a side saddle", he would later claim; nevertheless, he agreed to take the case if the Council <b>could</b> <b>convince</b> thirty to forty percent of the state's school boards to join it. The Council eventually persuaded 66 of the 177 school boards to join. Working pro bono, Combs assembled a legal team that included Kern Alexander, a Kentucky native and education law expert who was named president of Western Kentucky University in November 1985.|$|E
