25|$|On {{passenger}} cars, the <b>CHMSL</b> may {{be placed}} above the back glass, {{affixed to the}} vehicle's interior just inside the back glass, {{or it may be}} integrated into the vehicle's deck lid or into a spoiler. Other specialised fitments are sometimes seen; the Jeep Wrangler and Land Rover Freelander have the <b>CHMSL</b> on a stalk fixed to the spare wheel carrier. Trucks, vans and commercial vehicles sometimes have the <b>CHMSL</b> mounted to the trailing edge of the vehicle's roof. The <b>CHMSL</b> is required by regulations worldwide to be centred laterally on the vehicle, though UN Regulation 48 permits lateral offset of up to 15cm if the vehicle's lateral centre is not coincident with a fixed body panel, but instead separates movable components such as doors. The Renault Master and Ford Transit van, for example, uses a laterally offset <b>CHMSL</b> for this reason. The height of the <b>CHMSL</b> is also regulated, in absolute terms and with respect to the mounting height of the vehicle's conventional left and right stop lamps. Depending on the left and right lamps' height, the lower edge of the <b>CHMSL</b> may be just above the left and right lamps' upper edge.|$|E
25|$|The <b>CHMSL</b> is {{generally}} required to illuminate steadily and {{not permitted to}} flash, though U.S. regulators granted Mercedes-Benz a temporary, 24-month exemption in January 2006 to the steady-light requirement so as to evaluate whether a flashing <b>CHMSL</b> provides an emergency stop signal that effectively reduces {{the likelihood of a}} crash.|$|E
25|$|The <b>CHMSL</b> is {{intended}} to provide a warning to drivers whose view of the vehicle's left and right stop lamps is blocked by interceding vehicles.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence of stop lamp intensity, area, and aspect ratio on reaction time. Recent trends in auto body styling have begun to incorporate center high-mounted stop lamps (<b>CHMSLs)</b> into spoilers and trunk lids. These developments, brought on in part by technical advances in automotive lighting, have resulted in questions about the efficacy of stop lamps whose effective luminous area is long and narrow. Subjects in this study were asked to perform a computer-based tracking task to control their eye fixations, and to provide the approximate cognitive loading associated with driving, while responding to the onset of stop lamps of varying characteristics. The results of this laboratory study indicate that aspect ratio and intensity of stop lamps, as well as their interaction, influence reaction time. Specifically, subject reaction times to the onset of simulated stop lamps were longer when the stimulus intensity was low and the aspect ratio was large. These results suggest that further empirical investigation that examines intensity, area, and aspect ratio of stop lamps in the context of the total rear-signaling system is required to determine whether regulation affecting the aspect ratio of stop lamps or <b>CHMSLs</b> is warranted...|$|R
25|$|Effective {{with the}} 1986 model year, the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Transport Canada {{mandated}} that all new passenger cars come {{equipped with a}} <b>CHMSL.</b> The requirement was extended to light trucks and vans for the 1994 model year. Early studies involving taxicabs and other fleet vehicles found that a third, high-level stop lamp reduced rear-end collisions by about 50%. Once the novelty effect wore off as most vehicles on the road came to be equipped with the central third stop lamp, the crash-avoidance benefit declined.

This was the final year for the L69 5.0 305 HO 4-bbl option, of which 63 were built for racing in Canada's Player's series and 11 for public sale, making a total of 74. The 2.8 L V6 was now the standard engine in the base model, replacing the 2.5 L I-4 model. The 305 TPI LB9 horsepower rating dropped from [...] to [...] in the IROC-Z models.

The engine options included the naturally aspirated 2.2 L Four, and a turbocharged version of the same engine. From 1989 on, the 2.5 L Four became available with or without a turbocharger. The 2.2 engine was dropped, except for the Turbo II version that was standard equipment on the Chrysler GTS Shelby, the European sibling of the Dodge Lancer Shelby.

This model was only available with the standard cab and regular fleet-side box. Colors included white, black, and red. The Work Truck (W/T) was also introduced in 1990, which featured a single-cab long bed with Cheyenne trim and new grille with black bumpers.

In 1991, the 4L80-E automatic transmission was available for the 3/4-ton and one-ton trucks. In 1992, the four-speed manual transmission was dropped and the stepside trucks were available with extended cabs. The 6.5-liter diesel V8 was also made available with a turbocharger. In 1989, a Sport package was available for the fleet side short-bed Chevrolet trucks, featuring body-colored, striped molding, body-colored bumpers, and a blacked-out grille with chrome-plated steel wheels and specialized chromed plastic center caps. The Sport package also included a standard Chevrolet Receiver hitch and stiffer rear suspension, as well as oil and transmission cooling lines and heftier brake package. Of the first 1989 Silverado sport trucks there were only 5,400 produced. The Sport was re-introduced in 1990, this time with composite headlights and different sport emblems on the bedsides.

In 1993 all 1500 series and 2500 series two-wheel drive trucks were assembled with the newer 4L60E transmission and the 700 R4 was no longer used at this point. Exterior changes this year included a special two-tone paint job, available in many different varieties new gloss black folding exterior mirrors, and the door handles were changed from a smooth gloss black finish to a textured, satin finish. All 1995 models received a new interior that included a new steering wheel containing a driver's-side airbag, a new dashboard containing a more central-mounted radio, dial-operated HVAC system and an improved gauge cluster. New front door panels, and new seating were also included. In 1996, a passenger-side-mounted third door was optional on extended cab models. A new range of engines was included. The [...] "Vortec" [...] engines meant HP increases across gasoline V6 and V8 small-block engines. The 6.2 diesel V8 was dropped.|$|E

A variant of the standard centre high mounted stop light (<b>CHMSL)</b> that flashes under conditions of heavy braking was developed to reduce the incidence and severity of rear-end collisions.

Forty-two participants completed a series of simulator drives that were designed to examine whether participants’ braking performance under certain conditions was more effective in response to a heavily braking vehicle fitted with the Heavy Braking Light compared with a heavily braking vehicle fitted with a standard <b>CHMSL.</b> Among other things, it was found that, relative to the <b>CHMSL</b> condition, participants reacted by braking in a shorter time at an intermediate headway to the Heavy Braking Light, and braked harder in response to the Heavy Braking Light at both a near and intermediate headway. The results suggest that the Heavy Braking Light is a device that, through widespread use, may contribute to a reduction in the incidence and severity of rear-end collisions...|$|E
