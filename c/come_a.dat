5|$|Cairano's {{concentration}} on the Caesars is interrupted only briefly by {{the return of}} Tamagnino between 1499 and 1500. Tamagnino, likely based on his lauded works at the Certosa di Pavia, receives a commission for six different Caesars and other sculptures. But in an art scene increasingly monopolised by Cairano, who has <b>come</b> <b>a</b> long way from his naive expression of the Apostles, Tamagnino does not garner much attention, and, humiliated by the cold reception, he leaves Brescia, probably never to return.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{forecast}} {{called for the}} heat inversion to end that day, followed by a cold wind that would disperse the smog. Nevertheless, Heller {{said that if the}} wind did not <b>come,</b> <b>a</b> first-stage alert would likely remain in effect and it might become necessary to declare a second-stage alert if conditions worsened.|$|E
5|$|All {{day train}} service was {{restored}} from Burlington to Whitby, and peak service was finally brought to Oshawa in 2000, {{but this would}} be only one indicator of things to <b>come.</b> <b>A</b> large initiative to expand the GO Transit network in the mid-2000s under the GO Transit Rail Improvement Plan, or GO TRIP. $1 billion was invested in multiple rail and bus projects, making it the largest commuter rail project in Canadian history. This was later dwarfed by a further slate of new GO infrastructure proposed in MoveOntario 2020, the provincial transit plan announced by Premier Dalton McGuinty in the leadup to the 2007 provincial election. With significant re-investment in regional transit, GO experienced significant growth in its train network: all day service was restored to Oshawa in 2006 and Aldershot in 2007; service was expanded to Barrie South in 2007, to Lincolnville in 2008 and to Kitchener in 2011; and an excursion train now operates on summer weekends to Niagara Falls.|$|E

5|$|In the 1580s, Peerson was a choirboy of St. Paul's Cathedral in London under organist Thomas Mulliner. Subsequently, he {{came under}} the {{patronage}} of the poet Fulke Greville. On May Day in 1604 Peerson's setting of the madrigal See, O See, Who is Heere <b>Come</b> <b>a</b> Maying was performed as part of Ben Jonson's Private Entertainment of the King and Queene {{at the house of}} Sir William Cornwallis at Highgate (now in London). A letter dated 7 December 1609 states that at the time Peerson was living at Newington (now Stoke Newington, London) and had composed several lessons for the virginals, which was his principal instrument. It appears that he had Roman Catholic sympathies, for that year, on the same occasion as Jonson, he was convicted of recusancy – the statutory offence of not complying with the established Church of England.|$|E
5|$|The Jaguar was {{to replace}} the McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR2 in the close air support, {{tactical}} reconnaissance and tactical strike roles, freeing the Phantom {{to be used for}} air defence. Both the French and British trainer requirements had developed significantly, and were eventually fulfilled instead by the Alpha Jet and Hawker Siddeley Hawk respectively. The French, meanwhile, had chosen the Jaguar {{to replace the}} Aeronavale's Dassault Étendard IV, and increased their order to include an initial 40 of a carrier-capable maritime version of the Jaguar, the Jaguar M, for the Aeronavale. From these apparently disparate aims would <b>come</b> <b>a</b> single and entirely different aircraft: relatively high-tech, supersonic, and optimised for ground-attack in a high-threat environment.|$|E

60|$|Just then <b>came</b> <b>a</b> narrow turn, with a down grade, very uneven {{and full}} of rocks. Over the latter bumped the carriage. Then <b>came</b> <b>a</b> sudden jounce, {{followed}} by a crash.|$|R
60|$|<b>A</b> {{minute later}} <b>came</b> <b>a</b> fierce gust of wind, {{followed}} by {{a second and then}} a third. Around spun the biplane and then tilted up as if about to go over. Then <b>came</b> <b>an</b> unexpected ripping and tearing sound.|$|R
60|$|Steadily, inevitably <b>came</b> <b>a</b> {{brilliant}} line, <b>came</b> <b>a</b> thin edge of intolerable effulgence {{that took}} a circular shape, became a bow, became a blazing sceptre, and hurled a shaft of heat at us {{as though it was}} a spear.|$|R

60|$|<b>A</b> {{moment later}} <b>came</b> <b>a</b> {{gust of wind}} that almost lifted them from their feet. The trees of the forest were bent lower than ever, and amid the {{whistling}} of the tornado <b>came</b> <b>a</b> crack {{like that of a}} big pistol.|$|R
60|$|Forward {{went the}} Army of Red, {{throwing}} snowballs wildly. Then <b>came</b> <b>a</b> shower of balls in return, {{and several of}} the Reds were seen to fall, as if knocked down. Then <b>came</b> <b>a</b> pause, and several lads started to go back.|$|R
50|$|Then <b>came</b> <b>a</b> new band—Sweet Lightning—and the {{attention}} of RCA records, where they recorded an LP {{and a pair of}} singles. Next <b>came</b> <b>a</b> move to Cleveland, where Pete recorded with Eric Carmen (Raspberries), then joined the Euclid Beach Band.|$|R
25|$|What Dreams May <b>Come,</b> <b>a</b> 1998 {{movie that}} won an Academy Award for its {{depiction}} {{of heaven and}} hell as the subjective creations of the individual, was an essentially mystical interpretation of heaven, hell and reincarnation.

25|$|Mixed {{martial arts}} (MMA) has <b>come</b> <b>a</b> huge way. The sport {{was on the}} verge of being sent into {{oblivion}} in the early 1990s but has since clawed its way back and become one of the most popular sports in the USA.|$|E
25|$|With the popularization of Facebook and microtransactions has <b>come</b> <b>a</b> {{new wave}} of Flash and HTML5 based MMORPGs that use the free to play model.

60|$|It was cold, {{and evening}} was falling into dusk. Down the high-road came wild half-ragged men on ponies, in all degrees of costume and not-costume: came four wide-eyed cows {{stepping}} down-hill round the corner, and three delicate, beautiful merino sheep which stared {{at us with}} their prominent, gold-curious eyes: <b>came</b> <b>an</b> ancient, ancient man with <b>a</b> stick: <b>came</b> <b>a</b> stout-chested peasant carrying <b>a</b> long wood-pole: <b>came</b> <b>a</b> straggle of alert and triumphant goats, long-horned, long-haired, jingling their bells. Everybody greeted us hesitatingly. And everything <b>came</b> to <b>a</b> halt at the Risveglio corner, while the men had a nip.|$|R
60|$|In {{the midst}} of the tempest there <b>came</b> <b>a</b> sudden lull. Wind and water alike seemed hushed. And out of the lull, as if in answer to the woman's question, there <b>came</b> <b>a</b> loud cry--the shriek of a man in deadly peril.|$|R
25|$|Public {{healthcare}} is {{no longer}} an illusion for the poor. The district has <b>come</b> <b>a</b> long way from the colonial era.

25|$|Biogerontologist Marios Kyriazis {{suggested}} that biological immortality in humans is an inevitable consequence of natural evolution. His theory of extreme lifespans through perpetual-equalising interventions (ELPIs) proposes {{that the ability}} to attain indefinite lifespans is inherent in human biology, and that there will <b>come</b> <b>a</b> time when humans will continue to develop their intelligence by living indefinitely, rather than through evolution by natural selection.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1830s, Sydney Town had <b>come</b> <b>a</b> {{long way from}} its origins as a convict colony four decades earlier and free {{settlers}} were increasing in numbers. The Reverend John Dunmore Lang wished to build an Australian College in Sydney and sent Reverend Henry Carmichael to recruit craftsmen in Scotland. On the return journey in 1831 aboard the Stirling Castle Carmichael gave classes {{to some of these}} men. They formed the nucleus of a Mechanics' Institute when they arrived in Sydney.|$|E

25|$|After {{the failure}} of the anti-Roman Bar Kokhba revolt in the 2nd century AD which looked to a human leader as the promised messiah, Jews began to {{conceive}} of the messianic age in supernatural terms: first would <b>come</b> <b>a</b> forerunner, the Messiah ben Joseph, who would defeat Israel's enemies, identified as Gog and Magog, to prepare the way for the Messiah ben David; then the dead would rise, divine judgement would be handed out, and the righteous would be rewarded.|$|E
25|$|Vadilal Industries has <b>come</b> <b>a</b> {{long way}} since its {{inception}} in 1926, when Vadilal Gandhi started a soda fountain in 1926. He passed on the business to his son, Ranchod Lal, who ran a one-man operation. Eventually, Ranchod Lal's sons, Ramchandra and Lakshman, inherited the business and they were instrumental in giving a new direction to the company. The duo imparted a new vision to the venture and infused a spirit of calculated risk-taking into the firm. As a result, by the 1970s, the Vadilal Company had already evolved into a modern corporate entity.|$|E

After staring into the horizon, Homura leans over and falls off a cliff.|$|E
