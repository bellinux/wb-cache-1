40|$|To {{comprehensively}} assess conventional vs. some alternative laying-hen housing systems under U. S. production conditions, a multi-institute and multi-disciplinary project, {{known as}} the Coalition for Sustainable Egg Supply (CSES) study, was carried out at a commercial egg production farm in the Midwestern United States over two single-cycle production flocks. The housing systems studied include a conventional <b>cage</b> <b>house</b> (200, 000 hen capacity), an aviary house (50, 000 hen capacity), and an enriched colony house (50, 000 hen capacity). As {{an integral part of}} the CSES project, continual environmental monitoring over a 27 -month period described in this paper quantifies indoor gaseous and particulate matter concentrations, thermal environment, and building ventilation rate of each house. Results showed that similar indoor thermal environments in all three houses were maintained through ventilation management and environmental control. Gaseous and particulate matter concentrations of the enriched colony house were comparable with those of the conventional <b>cage</b> <b>house.</b> In comparison, the aviary house had poorer indoor air quality, especially in wintertime, resulting from the presence of floor litter (higher ammonia levels) and hens’ activities (higher particulate matter levels) in it. Specifically, daily mean indoor ammonia concentrations had the 95 % confidence interval values of 3. 8 to 4. 2 (overall mean of 4. 0) ppm for the conventional cage house; 6. 2 to 7. 2 (overall mean of 6. 7) ppm for the aviary house; and 2. 7 to 3. 0 (overall mean of 2. 8) ppm for the enriched colony house. The 95 % confidence interval (overall mean) values of daily mean indoor carbon dioxide concentrations were 1997 to 2170 (2083) ppm for the conventional <b>cage</b> <b>house,</b> 2367 to 2582 (2475) ppm for the aviary house, and 2124 to 2309 (2216) ppm for the enriched colony house. Daily mean indoor methane concentrations were similar for all three houses, with 95 % confidence interval values of 11. 1 to 11. 9 (overall mean of 11. 5) ppm. The 95 % confidence interval values (overall mean) of daily mean PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations, in mg/m 3, were, respectively, 0. 57 to 0. 61 (0. 59) and 0. 033 to 0. 037 (0. 035) for the conventional <b>cage</b> <b>house,</b> 3. 61 to 4. 29 (3. 95) and 0. 374 to 0. 446 (0. 410) for the aviary house, and 0. 42 to 0. 46 (0. 44) and 0. 054 to 0. 059 (0. 056) for the enriched colony house.

40|$|The {{metabolism}} cage is a barren, non-enriched, environment, combining {{a number of}} recognized environmental stressors. We investigated the ability of male BALB/c mice to acclimatize to this form of housing. For three weeks markers of acute and oxidative stress, as well as clinical signs of abnormality were monitored. Forced swim tests were conducted {{to determine whether the}} animals experienced behavioral despair and the serotonergic integrity was tested using an 8 -OH-DPAT challenge. The metabolism <b>cage</b> <b>housed</b> mice excreted approximately tenfold higher amounts of corticosterone metabolites in feces throughout the study when compared to controls. Urinary biomarkers confirmed that these mice suffered from elevated levels of oxidative stress, and increased creatinine excretions indicated increased muscle catabolism. Changes in the core body temperature (stress-induced hyperthermia) and the fur state of the mice also indicated impaired well-being in the metabolism <b>cage</b> <b>housed</b> mice. However, monitoring body weight and feed intake was found misleading in assessing the wellbeing of mice over a longer time course, and the forced swim test was found poorly suited for studying chronic stress in mice in the present setup. In conclusion, the mice were found not to acclimatize to the {{metabolism cage}}s whereby concern for animal welfare would dictate that mice should be housed in this way for as short periods as possible.

40|$|Two feeding {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to {{study the effects of}} dietary protein and energy upon feed consumption, nutrient intake and performance of laying and non-laying hens. These trials were conducted in a windowless cage layer house located at the Poultry Research Complex on the East Campus of the University of Nebraska. Environmental conditions were partially controlled within the <b>cage</b> <b>house.</b> Ventilation was regulated by thermostatically electric fans. Artificial light was supplied by incandescent lamps which were controlled with automatic time clocks. The hens were given 14 hours of continuous light and 10 consecutive hours of darkness per day. Higher levels of dietary protein were found to exert a definite but, insignificant effect increasing feed consumption. However, it was concluded that the effect of dietary protein upon feed intake was an indirect one resulting from an increased egg production as protein intake increased with increasing levels of dietary protein. The most prominent effect of increasing levels of dietary energy was to decrease feed consumption. This effect was highly significant in all cases. Advisor: Earl W. Gleave...|$|E

Host nutrition {{is one of the}} important ecological factors that affect the incidence and severity of the disease and the relationship between nutrition and the disease varies with the host and parasite involved (5, 6). Several workers have studied the effect of different nutrients on the downy mildew development on different hosts. Since, information on downy mildew of blond psyllium is lacking, present studies were undertaken to know the impact of host nutrition on the severity of downy mildew on blond psyllium.

40|$|Effects of tallow supplementation on dietary {{nutrient}} {{and minimal}} amino acid utilization in the laying hen were studied in two experiments. In the first experiment diets contained six levels of animal tallow ranging from 0 to 10 %. Percent egg production and egg mass {{were not significantly}} affected by tallow. Body weight was significantly increased by 2 % tallow was maximum at 6 %. Addition of up to 6 % fat improved feed conversion without adversely affecting other production characteristics. Metabolizable energy (ME) intake increased from 305. 1 to 322. 4 kcal/hen/d over the range of 0 to 6 % tallow with no further improvement at higher tallow levels. Maximum net energetic efficiency was obtained with 2 and 4 % tallow. Ability to digest tallow declined significantly with hen age. Higher tallow ME values were obtained from calorimetry data than from digestibility measurements due to beneficial effects of tallow on digestibilities of fat and protein in the basal diet. No improvement in starch retention was observed with tallow supplementation. In the second experiment, diets containing four levels of protein (15. 0, 13. 6, 15. 0 + methionine and 17. 0 %) without and with 3 % tallow were fed to hens housed in an open <b>cage</b> <b>house</b> or an insulated, evaporatively cooled house. Egg production and egg mass were significantly higher in the insulated house. This study indicates that reducing total protein below the National Research Council (NRC, 1984) recommended level significantly reduced egg production by birds housed in an open house. Supplemental methionine to provide. 60 % TSAA was required for maximum egg production. Egg production was significantly improved with the low protein diet when 3 % tallow was added; however, egg production rate supported by this combination was significantly below that obtained with the 17 % protein diet either with or without added tallow. For birds housed in the insulated, evaporatively cooled house the diet based on the NRC amino acid recommendations appeared to be optimal for performance, even with a lower protein level.

Internal and external temperature and relative humidity, ventilation rate, PM 10 concentration have been continuously monitored in order to evaluate particulate matter concentration changes during the day and the season and to define PM 10 emission factors. PM 10 concentration was corrected by gravimetric technique to lower measurements error. In the aviary system house, TSP and fine particulate matter (particles smaller than 2. 5 micron) concentration was measured. Average yearly PM 10 concentration was remarkably higher in the aviary system house with 0. 215 mg m- 3 vs 108 mg m- 3 for the ventilated belt house and vs 0. 094 mg m- 3 for the traditional battery <b>cages</b> <b>house.</b> In the Aviary system housing, TSP concentration was 0. 444 mg m- 3 and PM 2. 5 was 0. 032 mg m- 3, highlighting the existence of a severe working environment for men and animals.

40|$|As an {{integral}} part of the Coalition for Sustainable Egg Supply (CSES) Project, this study simultaneously monitored air emissions of 3 commercially operated egg production systems at the house level and associated manure storage over 2 single-cycle flocks (18 to 78 wk of age). The 3 housing systems were 1) a conventional <b>cage</b> <b>house</b> (CC) with a 200, 000 -hen capacity (6 hens in a cage at a stocking density of 516 cm 2 /hen), 2) an enriched colony house (EC) with a 50, 000 -hen capacity (60 hens per colony at a stocking density of 752 cm 2 /hen), and 3) an aviary house (AV) with a 50, 000 -hen capacity (at a stocking density of 1253 to 1257 cm 2 /hen). The 3 hen houses were located on the same farm and were populated with Lohmann white hens of the same age. Indoor environment and house-level gaseous (ammonia [NH 3] and greenhouse gasses [GHG], including carbon dioxide [CO 2], methane [CH 4], and nitrous oxide [N 2 O]) and particulate matter (PM 10, PM 2. 5) emissions were monitored continually. Gaseous emissions from the respective manure storage of each housing system were also monitored. Emission rates (ERs) are expressed as emission quantities per hen, per animal unit (AU, 500 kg live BW), and per kilogram of egg output. House-level NH 3 ER (g/hen/d) of EC (0. 054) was significantly lower than that of CC (0. 082) or AV (0. 112) (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). The house-level CO 2 ER (g/hen/d) was lower for CC (68. 3) than for EC and AV (74. 4 and 74. 0, respectively), and the CH 4 ER (g/hen/d) was similar for all 3 houses (0. 07 to 0. 08). The house-level PM ER (mg/hen/d), essentially representing the farm-level PM ER, was significantly higher for AV (PM 10 100. 3 and PM 2. 5 8. 8) than for CC (PM 10 15. 7 and PM 2. 5 0. 9) or EC (PM 10 15. 6 and PM 2. 5 1. 7) (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). The farm-level (house plus manure storage) NH 3 ER (g/hen/d) was significantly lower for EC (0. 16) than for CC (0. 29) or AV (0. 30) (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). As expected, the magnitudes of GHG emissions were rather small for all 3 production systems.

40|$|Thesis (PhD(Agric)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. The {{sugarcane}} borer, Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is {{the most}} limiting factor in the South African sugar industry with losses to this insect pest estimated {{to be at least}} ZAR 60 million per annum. Because of its cryptic nature as well as the fact that E. saccharina is both indigenous to Africa and occurs on several host plants, attempts to control or eradicate it using several available methods have not been very successful. However, the sterile insect technique (SIT) is one of the newer control methods that can be incorporated into an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) programme to achieve better control or eradication. The implementation of the SIT program needs to go through a series of well-researched phases in order to be successful. In the first of this multi-phase project, it was determined that E. saccharina is susceptible to ionizing radiation, and is thus a suitable candidate for the SIT development against it and that a sub-sterilizing dose of 200 Gy is sufficient to induce F 1 (inherited) sterility in male and complete sterility in female moths respectively. The results presented here are discussed in the context of further development of the SIT as an addition to the arsenal of tactics in an AW-IPM programme against E. saccharina. Based on these initial findings, the study examined the lek and mating behavior of male moths subjected to three radiation doses (150, 200, 250 Gy) against normal non-irradiated/fertile moths. Both mass-rearing and irradiation of E. saccharina led to a quantitative departure of male mating behavior away from that exhibited by their wild counterparts. However, treated males are still able to form leks and mate with wild females. Male E. saccharina irradiated at all three doses tested were found to be as active and competitive as wild males, but in some of the traits measured, performance diminished significantly with an increase in the radiation dosage. In general, the performance of moths treated at 200 Gy did not differ significantly from that of moths treated at 150 Gy and therefore the former dose is ideal for SIT development since it results in a lower residual F 1 fertility than the latter. The level of mating competitiveness and compatibility was assessed under both laboratory and semi-field conditions in pairwise comparisons consisting of laboratory reared vs. wild (L-W), 200 Gy irradiated vs. wild (S-W) and laboratory reared vs. irradiated moths (L-S). Based on the results from the more robust field cage assays, the mating indices generated indicated that the mass-reared E. saccharina strain produced in South Africa has not yet evolved sexual behaviours suggestive of incipient pre-mating isolation barriers with local wild strains. Wild moths did not discriminate against either the partially sterile or laboratory reared moths and most importantly, the irradiated males mated significantly more than their wild counterparts regardless of the type of female. The irradiated insects could therefore achieve the purpose for which they are intended upon release into the field. Third, the critical thermal limits (CTLs) to activity at high and low temperatures (i. e. critical thermal maxima “CTmax” and minima “CTmin”) of different E. saccharina strains/treatments were investigated under standard experimental conditions. The effect of laboratory rearing and increasing radiation dosage on thermal tolerance of the adult stage of E. saccharina was explored. There were highly significant differences between the laboratory-reared and wild strain and also between non-irradiated and irradiated strains in both CTmax and CTmin. Laboratory reared E. saccharina moths were more heat tolerant compared to wild moths for both genders while in the case of CTmin, the reverse was true. Irradiation had a negative effect on both CTmax and CTmin. Moths treated at the lowest radiation dose were more cold and heat tolerant than those treated at higher dosages thereby reinforcing the importance of lower dosages rather than those that induce full sterility against E. saccharina. In general, gender effects on the CTLs were non-significant. Pilot sterile male releases in shade house trials to measure the impact of sustained releases of partially sterile adult males at an over-flooding moth ratio of 10 T: 1 U (treated to untreated),were conducted to measure their efficacy to stop E. saccharina incursions and suppress populations prior to testing in pilot studies under true season-long and area wide conditions. Results from the current study demonstrated that releasing partially irradiated (200 Gy) adult male moths at the afore mentioned release rate significantly reduced sugarcane stalk damage as well as lowered the number of fertile progeny from F 1 to succeeding generations in a stable E. saccharina population initiated in a <b>cage</b> <b>house.</b> There were more damaged internodes per stalk in the control than in the sugarcane receiving regular releases of partially sterile male moths. Overall, there were significantly more undamaged stalks in the treated sugarcane than the untreated control. Furthermore, there were significantly more larvae per stalk retrieved from the control compared to the treated sugarcane suggesting that the sustained release of steriles was efficacious in reducing emergence of fertile larvae in the succeeding generations. The results {{of this study indicate that}} there is considerable scope for the SIT against E. saccharina...|$|E

40|$|Maintaining {{comfortable}} thermal {{environments and}} good {{indoor air quality}} is essential to ensuring optimal production performance, welfare, and health of animals. Alternative laying-hen housing systems are being adopted by some egg producers in the U. S. However, information on indoor thermal and aerial environments of such alternative housing systems is meager. This article reports a one-year monitoring of thermal conditions (air temperature and relative humidity or RH) and ammonia (NH 3) concentrations and emissions of four aviary laying-hen houses (same dimensions, manure belt plus litter floor systems, 50, 000 -hen capacity each) at a commercial farm in the Midwest U. S. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentrations at the air inlet and near the exhaust fans were measured and used, along with literature values of the metabolic rates of the hens, to estimate building ventilation rate (VR). The results show that indoor temperature, RH, CO 2 concentration, NH 3 concentration, and VR of the four houses (mean Â±standard deviation) were 23. 4 Â°C Â± 0. 3 Â°C, 64 % Â± 3 %, 1520 Â± 87 ppm, 5. 2 Â± 0. 4 ppm, and 4. 5 Â± 0. 6 m 3 h- 1 hen- 1, respectively. The highest daily mean NH 3 concentration was 13 Â ppm (and 20 ppm within the day) in winter. The NH 3 emission rate was 0. 14 Â± 0. 01 g d- 1 hen- 1. These values of NH 3 concentrations and emissions were lower than those reported for European aviary houses. The NH 3 emissions of the monitored aviary houses {{in this study are}} comparable to those of U. S. manure-belt <b>cage</b> <b>houses,</b> but are much lower than those of U. S. high-rise <b>cage</b> <b>houses.</b> The magnitude of NH 3 emissions observed in this study was consistent with that of similar aviary houses with brown hens in another extended field measurement in the same region...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of metabolic <b>cage</b> <b>housing</b> on the Wistar rat physiological state and to analyze the correlation between the minerals in blood and urine. Thirty male rats were used in the experiment. Fifteen rats (control group) were housed individually in standard polycarbonate cages and fifteen rats (experimental group) in metabolic cages (Techniplast, Italy) for two weeks. Body weight, respiration rate, water and food consumptions were recorded for each animal at the beginning of the experiment. The same parameters, as well as blood and urine parameters of control and experimental animals were recorded during the experiment after 72 h, 168 h and 336 h of <b>housing</b> in standard <b>cages</b> and metabolic cages. Urine collection was measured only in the experimental group. Rats weight decreased from 3. 84 % to 18. 59 % (P< 0. 05), respiration rate from 18. 65 % to 24. 59 % (P< 0. 05) when rats were <b>housed</b> in metabolic <b>cages.</b> Consumption of food and water by the rat depended on how long the animal was kept in metabolic cage. Glucose concentration increased on average by 15. 37 %, WBC count decreased by 5. 83 % in the blood of rats <b>housed</b> in metabolic <b>cages</b> compared to the animals <b>housed</b> in standard <b>cages.</b> We did not observe significant changes of triglycerides concentration, red blood cells count and total protein between all rats. The positive moderate correlation of rat housing in a metabolic cage was between K blood and K urine, P blood and P urine, Na blood and K blood, between Na urine and P urine and significant negative moderate correlation was determined between K urine and P urine. These present study findings indicate that metabolism <b>cage</b> <b>housing</b> significantly affects rat’s physiological parameters and potentially may influence animal health and wellbeing...|$|R

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the story, hoping {{to learn more about the}} science to which he owes his human intelligence, Johnny is reading an encyclopedia article about chemistry. Finding it hard to puzzle through without Professor Methuen's help, he goes for an amble about the station. The station seems unusually quiet. At the <b>cages</b> <b>housing</b> some of the other animals he finds the birds and monkeys chattering away as usual, but the chimpanzee McGinty in a catatonic state. Trotting over to the kitchen in hope of lunch, he finds the cook Honoria Velez in the same condition, and afterwards the station's scientists, including his patron Methuen, equally afflicted. Only nipping or prodding at them induces them into any movement, and that the minimum required to avoid the stimulus.|$|R
40|$|Beginning January 1, 2015, {{conventional}} <b>cage</b> <b>housing</b> for egg-laying hens {{is scheduled}} to be prohibited in California. We consider the economic implications of the new hen housing regulations on the California shell egg industry. Our data show that egg production is more costly using noncage systems than conventional cages. The main result of the new regulations will be a drastic {{reduction in the number of}} eggs produced in California, a large increase in egg shipments from out of state, little if any change in hen housing for eggs consumed in California, and little change in egg prices in California. animal welfare regulation, hen housing, egg supply, egg prices, egg costs of production, Agribusiness, Agricultural and Food Policy, Agricultural Finance, Consumer/Household Economics, Farm Management, Livestock Production/Industries, Production Economics, Productivity Analysis, Q 11, Q 18,...|$|R
