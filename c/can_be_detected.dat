5|$|A lesion in the {{posterior}} fossa <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> {{by asking the}} patient to roll his or her eyes upwards (Parinaud's syndrome).|$|E
5|$|Individual photons <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> {{by several}} methods. The classic {{photomultiplier}} tube exploits the photoelectric effect: a photon of sufficient energy strikes a metal plate and knocks free an electron, initiating an ever-amplifying avalanche of electrons. Semiconductor charge-coupled device chips use a similar effect: an incident photon generates a charge on a microscopic capacitor that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>detected.</b> Other detectors such as Geiger counters use {{the ability of}} photons to ionize gas molecules contained in the device, causing a detectable change of conductivity of the gas.|$|E
5|$|Germanium is {{normally}} absent in diamond, {{but it can}} be introduced during the growth or by subsequent ion implantation. Germanium in diamond <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> optically via the germanium-vacancy center, which has similar properties to those of the Si-vacancy center.|$|E
50|$|In A. japonicus, 5'-bromo- and 5'-chlorotetrafucol-A <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>detected.</b>|$|R
30|$|Lipid-containing angiomyolipoma <b>can</b> <b>be</b> easily <b>detected</b> with CT.|$|R
25|$|Dihydrocodeine <b>can</b> <b>be</b> presumptively <b>detected</b> by the Froehde reagent.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to its stimulant effects, mephedrone produces side effects, of which teeth grinding is the most common. The metabolism of mephedrone has been studied in rats and humans and the metabolites <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> in urine after usage.|$|E
5|$|No virus particles, bacteria, or fungi {{have been}} {{conclusively}} associated with prion diseases, although virus-like particles and Spiroplasma-like inclusions <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> in some TSE cases, {{but not in}} controls (uninfected individuals).|$|E
5|$|The {{map shows}} the {{exposures}} (black) and inferred near-surface extent (pink) of Siletzia, {{the latter being}} what <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> in the upper crust by aeromagnetic, gravitational, or seismological studies.|$|E

25|$|DNA {{methylation}} <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> by computational models through sophisticated algorithms and methods.|$|R
50|$|Now {{overgrown}} with vegetation, Pompeii Airfield's main runway <b>can</b> still <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> in aerial photographs.|$|R
5|$|A colour {{reaction}} for salts of acetic acid is iron(III) chloride solution, {{which results in}} a deeply red colour that disappears after acidification. A more sensitive test uses lanthanum nitrate with iodine and ammonia to give a blue solution. Acetates when heated with arsenic trioxide form cacodyl oxide, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> by its malodorous vapours.|$|E
5|$|Autoimmune {{disorders}} {{can often}} be traced to antibodies that bind the body's own epitopes; many <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> through blood tests. Antibodies directed against red blood cell surface antigens in immune mediated hemolytic anemia are detected with the Coombs test. The Coombs test is also used for antibody screening in blood transfusion preparation and also for antibody screening in antenatal women.|$|E
5|$|Damage to DNA {{alters the}} spatial {{configuration}} of the helix, and such alterations <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> by the cell. Once damage is localized, specific DNA repair molecules bind {{at or near the}} site of damage, inducing other molecules to bind and form a complex that enables the actual repair to take place.|$|E
50|$|The {{other two}} isomers are {{increasingly}} unstable. Bicycloprop-1-enyl <b>can</b> only <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> in trapping experiments.|$|R
50|$|Vessel {{restenosis}} <b>is</b> typically <b>detected</b> by angiography, but <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> by duplex ultrasound {{and other}} imaging techniques.|$|R
25|$|It <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> in {{passive mode}} by {{sniffing}} broadcast domains for repeating ARP requests.|$|R
5|$|However records {{indicate}} that Lochner's talent was recognised {{from an early}} age. He may have been of Netherlandish origin or worked there for a master, possibly Robert Campin. Lochner's work seems influenced by Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden; elements of their styles <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> in the structure and colourisation of Lochner's mature works, especially in his Last Judgment, although neither {{is thought to be}} the master with whom he studied.|$|E
5|$|Potassium <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> by taste {{because it}} {{triggers}} {{three of the}} five types of taste sensations, according to concentration. Dilute solutions of potassium ions taste sweet, allowing moderate concentrations in milk and juices, while higher concentrations become increasingly bitter/alkaline, and finally also salty to the taste. The combined bitterness and saltiness of high-potassium solutions makes high-dose potassium supplementation by liquid drinks a palatability challenge.|$|E
5|$|Pulsars are {{rotating}} {{neutron stars}} {{that have a}} magnetic field. A narrow beam of electromagnetic radiation is emitted from the poles of rotating pulsars. If the beam sweeps past {{the direction of the}} Solar System then the pulsar will produce a periodic pulse that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> from the Earth. The energy radiated by the magnetic field gradually slows down the rotation rate, so that older pulsars can require as long as several seconds between each pulse.|$|E
50|$|The Egg Nebula emits {{polarized}} light which <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> visually by a medium-sized telescope.|$|R

50|$|Linux malware <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> (and analyzed) using memory {{forensics}} tools, {{such as the}} following.|$|R
5|$|Remote {{observation}} of electrons requires detection of their radiated energy. For example, in high-energy environments {{such as the}} corona of a star, free electrons form a plasma that radiates energy due to Bremsstrahlung radiation. Electron gas can undergo plasma oscillation, which is waves caused by synchronized variations in electron density, and these produce energy emissions that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> by using radio telescopes.|$|E
5|$|Spacecraft and space-based modules that do {{particle}} detection, {{looking for}} cosmic rays and electrons. These can be emitted {{by the sun}} (Solar Energetic Particles), our galaxy (Galactic cosmic rays) and extragalactic sources (Extragalactic cosmic rays). There are also Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays from active galactic nuclei, those <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> by ground-based detectors via their particle showers.|$|E
5|$|The Wilson's disease gene (ATP7B) {{has been}} mapped to {{chromosome}} 13 (13q14.3) and is expressed {{primarily in the}} liver, kidney, and placenta. The gene codes for a P-type (cation transport enzyme) ATPase that transports copper into bile and incorporates it into ceruloplasmin. Mutations <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> in 90% of cases. Most (60%) are homozygous for ATP7B mutations (two abnormal copies), and 30% have only one abnormal copy. Ten percent have no detectable mutation.|$|E

5|$|The defects <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> by {{different}} types of spectroscopy, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), luminescence induced by light (photoluminescence, PL) or electron beam (cathodoluminescence, CL), and absorption {{of light in the}} infrared (IR), visible and UV parts of the spectrum. Absorption spectrum is used not only to identify the defects, but also to estimate their concentration; it can also distinguish natural from synthetic or enhanced diamonds.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of the}} {{induction}} phase is to reach a complete remission. Complete remission {{does not mean the}} disease has been cured; rather, it signifies no disease <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> with available diagnostic methods. Complete remission is obtained in about 50%â€“75% of newly diagnosed adults, although this may vary based on the prognostic factors described above. The length of remission depends on the prognostic features of the original leukemia. In general, all remissions will fail without additional consolidation therapy.|$|E
5|$|The lung is {{the main}} site of SFTPA1 synthesis, but SFTPA1 mRNA {{expression}} has also been detected in the trachea, prostate, pancreas, thymus, colon, eye, salivary gland and other tissues. Using specific monoclonal antibodies for Surfactant protein A, the protein <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>detected</b> in lung alveolar type II pneumocytes, club cells, and alveolar macrophages, but no extrapulmonary SP-A immunoreactivity was observed.|$|E
