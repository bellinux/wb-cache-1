40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to study the shelf life of guava under different post harvest treatments. Qualities of fruits of different varieties decreased with the advancement of storage duration and most were found to lose their marketability at the later stage except Kazi and Swarupkathi. In case of <b>wrapping</b> <b>materials,</b> white and black perforated polythene bags were better in on season for retaining marketability of guava fruits as compared with other treatments. Considering combined effect of variety and <b>wrapping</b> <b>materials,</b> fruits of the Kazi showed the longer duration of marketability among 10 varieties with all treatments. Weight loss of different guava varieties increased with increasing storage duration. Variety Kazi showed the lowest percentage of weight loss.

50|$|Cellophane was a DuPont Company plastic <b>wrapping</b> <b>material</b> {{that had}} its U.S. {{production}} restricted to du Pont by numerous patents {{in the early}} 1950s. Du Pont was sued under the Sherman Act for monopolization of the cellophane market by the U.S. Justice Department, and the case (U.S. v. E. I. du Pont) was decided by the Supreme Court in 1956. The Court agreed with du Pont that when evaluated at the monopolistic price observed in the early 1950s, there were many substitutes for cellophane and, therefore, du Pont had only a small {{share of the market}} for <b>wrapping</b> <b>materials</b> (i.e., it possessed little or no market power).|$|R

40|$|Adipocere is a greasy, waxy {{substance}} {{produced as}} a late post-mortem change that occurs due to putrefactive and hydrolytic enzymes {{associated with the}} decomposition process. Enzymes which convert free fatty acids in adipose tissue to saturated fatty acids commonly known to comprise adipocere include myristic, palmitic, stearic and hydroxy stearic acids. Many factors can affect the decomposition process, either increasing or retarding its rate of development, but there is limited research into the effects that <b>wrapping</b> <b>materials</b> and coverings have upon decomposition and adipocere formation in a forensic setting. A {{study was conducted to}} investigate the effects of different types of <b>wrapping</b> <b>materials</b> on the rate and extent of adipocere formation on a porcine model. Analysis using Gas-Chromatography coupled with Mass-Spectrometry was employed to determine the chemical composition of adipocere which formed over a 14 week decomposition period. The results suggest that <b>wrapping</b> <b>materials</b> accelerate the rate of adipocere formation in non-aqueous environments, suggesting that the water content within the porcine tissue is sufficient to induce adipocere formation. The chromatograms demonstrated the hydrolysis of triglycerides in fatty tissue to unsaturated fatty acids, oleic acid and palmitoleic acid. The further hydrogenation into saturated fatty acids, comprising palmitic acid and stearic acid were present confirming adipocere formation. A knowledge of the effects of a variety of different types of <b>wrapping</b> <b>materials</b> on the rate at which adipocere forms and its composition would be a useful forensic indicator and can offer valuable information for the estimation of post-mortem intervals and peri-mortem events.

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the shelf life and quality as affected by different stages of ripening, storage temperature as well as <b>wrapping</b> <b>materials</b> fruits of guava cv. Kazi. All the studied parameters except marketability increased for a certain storage period and then declined due {{to the effect of}} stages of ripening and <b>wrapping</b> <b>materials</b> (perforated and non perforated white and black polythene bag), while in case of storage temperature, there was gradual increase of physiological weight loss, sugar content (reducing, non-reducing and total sugar) and TSS content. Marketability decreased markedly with the advancement of storage period. All stages of ripening and all <b>wrapping</b> <b>materials</b> were able to keep fruits in marketable condition for 36 days of storage period. But fruits were in better marketable condition when harvested at stage 3 (ripe, yellowish green in colour and crispy pulp) or wrapped with black non-perforated polythene. 5 ºC storage temperature, was able to retain more percentage of fruits in marketable condition with longer storage duration. In case of treatment combinations, fruits harvested at stage 3, stored at 5 ºC temperature with black non-perforated polythene had the highest physiological weight loss, sugar content (reducing, non-reducing and total sugar) and TSS content while stage 1 fruits stored at 20 ºC with no wrapping (control) had the lowest...|$|R

50|$|Whitman's candy company {{initiated}} use of cellophane for <b>candy</b> <b>wrapping</b> in the United States in 1912 {{for their}} Whitman's Sampler. They remained the largest user of imported cellophane from France until nearly 1924, when DuPont {{built the first}} cellophane manufacturing plant in the US. Cellophane saw limited sales in the US at first since while it was waterproof, it was not moisture proof - it held water but was permeable to water vapor. This meant that it was unsuited to packaging products that required moisture proofing. DuPont hired chemist William Hale Charch, who spent three years developing a nitrocellulose lacquer that, when applied to Cellophane, made it moisture proof. Following the introduction of moisture-proof Cellophane in 1927, the material's sales tripled between 1928 and 1930, and in 1938, Cellophane accounted for 10% of DuPont's sales and 25% of its profits.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} testing eccentrically loaded columns externally wrapped with {{two types of}} materials. Six cylindrical (205 mm diameter and 925 mm height) plain columns were cast and tested. Half of the columns were wrapped with GFRP {{and the other half}} with CFRP. All columns were tested by applying an axial load at 50 mm eccentricity. In each group (GFRP or CFRP wrapped) of columns, one column did not have any vertical straps, one had vertical straps made of one layer of <b>wrapping</b> <b>material</b> and one column had vertical straps made of three layers of <b>wrapping</b> <b>material.</b> All columns were horizontally wrapped with three layers of material (GFRP or CFRP). A steel reinforced column was also cast and tested to serve as a reference column. Based on testing the columns it can be concluded that considerable gain in strength and ductility are obtained when reinforcing the columns with CFRP (vertical straps and horizontally wrapped).
