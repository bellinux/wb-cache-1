5000|$|European patents {{are granted}} by the European Patent Office under the 1973 European Patent Convention. 38 {{countries}} (including all countries of the European Union) are parties to the Convention. After grant, a European patent essentially becomes [...] "a bundle of national patents" [...] (subject, in some countries, to translation requirements in an official language of that country) in all countries separately, after which renewal fees are also due in all countries. Infringement procedures in one country have essentially no effect in others, which sometimes leads to multiple lawsuits regarding the same European patent in different countries; sometimes leading to different results. To reduce translation and litigation costs, the European Union has passed legislation regarding European patents with unitary effect. Registration of unitary effect is to be organized by the European Patent Office {{and is expected to}} result in limited translation requirements and a single renewal fee for the whole territory. As Spain and Italy objected to the translation requirements (featuring only the European Patent Convention languages English, German and French), they did not originally participate in the regulation, which was thus been organized as an enhanced <b>cooperation</b> <b>mechanism</b> between member states, though Italy subsequently joined. Unitary patent protection however also requires a uniform litigation system, provided for with the Unified Patent Court, constituted with the Agreement on a Unified Patent Court, signed on 19 February 2013.

A mixed methodology was used to obtain the values orientation profiles of twenty-nine respondents from six project environments using the Schwartz Values Survey Instrument (SVS) combined with repertory grid interviews to elicit the individuals' construct structures. Cluster and principal components analyses were subsequently carried out to enable values profiles to be assessed against construct categorisation. Two-dimensional values domains were obtained for all respondents where respondent propensity tended towards self-transcendent and openness-to-change domains (Schwartz, 1992). Values orientation was examined against elicited constructs after cluster and principal components analysis was carried out for each repertory grid interview response. Analysis enabled construct categorisation to be aligned with the categories identified in an amended model of <b>cooperation.</b> <b>Cooperation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> clustered into two groupings.

40|$|The {{separate}} trilateral <b>cooperation</b> <b>mechanism</b> among Japan, the Republic of Korea (thereafter Korea) and the People’s Republic of China (thereafter China) {{emerged from}} a wider framework for cooperation, the ASEAN Plus Three. To the scholarship on that framework, the new development constituted a puzzle, as the scholars considered a scenario for trilateral <b>cooperation</b> <b>mechanism</b> without ASEAN as highly unlikely. Instead, it took seriously prospects for Sino-Japanese competition and divisions running deep throughout all of Northeast Asia. Despite the obstacles that seemed insurmountable, a separate trilateral <b>cooperation</b> <b>mechanism</b> emerged in 2008. My argument to explain this development reaches back to regional sources. I introduce the analytical framework centred on foreign-policy preferences and outcomes to argue that collective outcomes originate neither in strategies of individual states nor in their bilateral relations, but through interaction {{at the level of}} a region; I also argue that the Trilateral Cooperation is a shift in regional affairs, but it is far from being a genuine revolution. I argue that ASEAN Plus Three provided a cooperative context for their relations in Asia. This thesis argues that for Asian international relations, the Trilateral <b>Cooperation</b> <b>mechanism</b> is neither a revolution nor an insignificant development, but a sign of shifts in regional affairs. While previous scholarship–as reviewed in chap. 2 –focused on obstacles to cooperation, my research emphasised the incentives. Even though a ‘trilateral cooperation’ may seem a vision too distant from the three states’ preferences, through interaction they achieved an outcome of cooperation in International Relations (chap. 1). Intentions of Japan, Korea, and China vis-à-vis Northeast Asian regional cooperation differ (chaps. 3, 4, and 5), but they share a participation in regional initiatives. Through a study of literature, official documents, and interviews, I re-picture foreign-policy profiles of these Northeast Asian states: albeit none of them was reaching for the Trilateral Cooperation in its specific form, this forum emerged as a side-effect of their regional interactions. This research implies that picturing state interests per ‘nation’ state leads to a stalemate in explanations. We can overcome this through allowing for side-effects of state interactions, which explain more effectively how preferences of the states can produce outcomes in International Relations...|$|E
