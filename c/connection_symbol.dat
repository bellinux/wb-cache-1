This work extends efforts showing {{the utility of}} linguistic models in verifiable robot control policies by now performing real visual analysis of human demonstrations to automatically extract a policy for the task. This method tokenizes each human demonstration into a sequence of object <b>connection</b> <b>symbols,</b> then transforms the set of sequences from all demonstrations into an automaton, which represents the task-language for assembling a desired object. Finally, we combine this assembly automaton with a kinematic model of a robot arm to reproduce the demonstrated task. I...|$|R

Rather than viewing the anchoring problem as a maintenance of <b>connections</b> between <b>symbols</b> and corresponding perceptual objects, we present a bottom-up approach in which symbols" are generated via a developmental process.

We motivate this approach by presenting an architecture that develops conceptual representations through its interactions with the environment. We argue that a general theory of anchoring that takes a top-down perspective will be inherently incomplete...|$|R

Lower bounds on the girth of PEG Tanner graphs {{and on the}} minimum distance of the resulting low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are derived in terms of parameters of the graphs. The PEG construction attains essentially the same girth as Gallager's explicit construction for regular graphs, both of which meet or exceed the Erdos [...] Sachs bound. Asymptotic analysis of a relaxed version of the PEG construction is presented. We describe an empirical approach using {{a variant of the}} "downhill simplex" search algorithm to design irregular PEG graphs for short codes with fewer than a thousand of bits, complementing the design approach of "density evolution" for larger codes. Encoding of LDPC codes based on the PEG construction is also investigated. We show how to exploit the PEG principle to obtain LDPC codes that allow linear time encoding. We also investigate regular and irregular LDPC codes using PEG Tanner graphs but allowing the symbol nodes to take values over GF(q), q > 2. Analysis and simulation demonstrate that one can obtain better performance with increasing field size, which contrasts with previous observations...|$|R

This study examined the impact of instruction that explicitly teaches preservice teachers the conceptual meaning of a mathematical symbol called the “bar diagram. ” Fifty undergraduate students (N = 50) were assigned to one of three conditions: Bar Diagram with Links (BDL), Bar Diagram with No Links (BDNL), or Comparison. The students in the BDL condition were explicitly shown, with the use of concrete materials, that Bar Diagrams are mathematical symbols used to represent quantity and relations among quantities. The BDNL condition was exposed to the Bar Diagram symbol without any explicit connection to referents. Students in the third condition served as a comparison group. Objectives of this study were to determine whether it is critical to make explicit connections to the conceptual meaning of a mathematical symbol prior to appropriately applying the symbol to (a) solve word problems presented using text in a story format, (b) view the bar diagrams as pictures that represent quantities for the purpose of solving problems, (c) understand the quantitative meaning of bar diagrams, and (d) use algebraic symbols to solve analogous problems. ...|$|R
