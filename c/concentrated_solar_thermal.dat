25|$|Solar {{photovoltaic}} modules {{have dropped}} about 75 per cent in price. Current {{scientific and technological}} advances in the laboratory suggest that they will soon be so cheap that the principal cost of going solar on residential and commercial buildings will be installation. On-shore wind power is spreading over all continents and is economically competitive with fossil and nuclear power in several regions. <b>Concentrated</b> <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> power (CST) with thermal storage has moved from the demonstration stage of maturity to the limited commercial stage and still {{has the potential for}} further cost reductions of about 50 per cent.|$|E
25|$|Solar thermal {{collectors}} {{are classified}} by the United States Energy Information Administration as low-, medium-, or high-temperature collectors. Low-temperature collectors are generally unglazed {{and used to}} heat swimming pools or to heat ventilation air. Medium-temperature collectors are also usually flat plates but are used for heating water or air for residential and commercial use. High-temperature collectors concentrate sunlight using mirrors or lenses and are generally used for fulfilling heat requirements up to 300 deg C / 20 bar pressure in industries, and for electric power production. Two categories include <b>Concentrated</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>Thermal</b> (CST) for fulfilling heat requirements in industries, and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) when the heat collected is used for power generation. CST and CSP are not replaceable in terms of application. The largest facilities {{are located in the}} American Mojave Desert of California and Nevada. These plants employ a variety of different technologies. The largest examples include, Ivanpah Solar Power Facility (377MW), Solar Energy Generating Systems installation (354MW), and Crescent Dunes (110MW). Spain is the other major developer of solar thermal power plant. The largest examples include, Solnova Solar Power Station (150MW), the Andasol solar power station (150MW), and Extresol Solar Power Station (100MW).|$|E

2500|$|Development of {{the power}} cycle - Developing a large helium or {{supercritical}} carbon dioxide turbine is needed for highest efficiency. These gas cycles offer numerous potential advantages for use with molten salt-fueled or molten salt-cooled reactors. These closed gas cycles face design challenges and engineering upscaling work for a commercial turbine-generator set. A standard supercritical steam turbine could be used at a small penalty in efficiency (the net efficiency of the MSBR {{was designed to be}} approximately 44%, using an old 1970s steam turbine). A molten salt to steam generator would still have to be developed. Currently, molten nitrate salt steam generators are used in <b>concentrated</b> <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> power plants such as Andasol in Spain.

50|$|Kazakhstan has {{areas with}} high {{insolation}} {{that could be}} suitable for solar power, particularly {{in the south of}} the country, receiving between 2200 and 3000h of sunlight per year, which equals 1200-1700 kW/m2 annually. Both <b>concentrated</b> <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> and solar photovoltaic(PV)have potential.There is a 2MW solar PV plant near Almaty and six solar PV plants are currently under construction in the Zhambyl province of southern Kazakhstan with a combined capacity of 300MW. In addition to solar PV, <b>concentrated</b> <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> is advantageous given it does not require water for operation so can be used in desert and semi-desert areas, the materials(steel, glass,and concrete) are domestically produced in Kazakhstan and readily available, and solar thermal plants store energy in the form of heat, which is far more efficient than the batteries used in PV systems and allows electricity to be produced on demand, even after the sun has set,enabling both base and peak loads to be met. There are no current plans to install a <b>concentrated</b> <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> plant although the government plans to create 1.04GW of renewable energy capacity by 2020.
