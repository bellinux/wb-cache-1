Typical frequency and magnitude profiles of <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> extensions of time are derived from a surveyed sample of 67 civil engineering projects in Hong Kong, and major categories of <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> extensions of time have been identified from the data obtained. Recommendations are made to minimize <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> extensions of time and to achieve more consistent assessments of the unavoidable <b>claims,</b> <b>for</b> example those relating to inclement weather. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|As {{the three}} {{suspects}} {{had been killed}} while preparing an act of terrorism, the court rejected the families' claims for damages, {{as well as their}} <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> expenses incurred at the inquest. The court did order the British government to pay the applicants' costs incurred during the proceedings in Strasbourg. The government initially suggested it would not pay, and there was discussion in parliament of the UK withdrawing from the ECHR. It paid the costs on 24 December 1995, within days of the three-month deadline which had been set by the court.|$|E

Though Brady lost that case, his proficiency for law and oration was immediately noted.|$|E

Distrustful of her ability to manage her finances, Wyatt made an arrangement with her sister Henrietta Lenhardt. Wyatt put oil leases he owned in Henrietta's name with the agreement that the proceeds would benefit Sadie after his death.

5|$|Prior to Baxter, {{the leading}} case on {{derivative}} governmental immunity in Australia was the 1979 High Court judgment in Bradken Consolidated Ltd v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd. In Bradken, the High Court upheld a <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> derivative governmental immunity by equipment suppliers to the Queensland Commissioner for Railways. The majority's conclusion {{was that if}} the Queensland government was immune from the TPA, it would prejudice the Queensland government if the contracts and arrangements it entered were subject to the TPA through the other parties to the contracts and arrangements.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeals {{held that}} Blacksmith could {{independently}} bring the <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> trespass, {{for which he}} need only show a right to possession. The Court of Appeals also held that Fellows' title was invalid, because the payment of compensation was a condition precedent. Welles, in dissent, agreed that Blacksmith could individually sue for trespass, but disagreed that the appraisal was a condition precedent; he would have reversed and granted a new trial, with costs. The Court of Appeals remanded back to the Supreme Court, after which a writ of error was granted by the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The series are counts of claimants for unemployment-related benefits at local benefit offices. The ONS release data to The Data Archive on schedule which coincides with the public release dates. Main Topics : From June 1983 onwards data have been produced in ward-based aggregations. Postcode sector aggregations are for the entire period from October 1982 onwards. Earlier data from October 1982 to August 1985 are also aggregated to Employment Office areas. Data for both stocks and flows (those joining or leaving the claimant count in the month) are produced. From May 1999, data on age and duration for stocks relate only to computerised claims processed clerically (currently fewer than 1 % of claims). Prior to May 1999, age and duration data for stocks include clerically processed <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> only quarter months (January, April, July and October). Data are also produced relating to claimants under 18, students, married women, and for stocks only, claimants under 60 <b>claiming</b> <b>for</b> less than 4 weeks, claimants under 60 <b>claiming</b> <b>for</b> more than 4 weeks, claimants over 60 <b>claiming</b> <b>for</b> less than 4 weeks, and claimants over 60 <b>claiming</b> <b>for</b> more than 4 weeks. For flows these data relate only to computerised <b>claims.</b> <b>For</b> stocks, they relate to all claims up to April 1999, and to computerised <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> May 1999 onwards. For datasets up to April 1999, data are produced relating to claimants whose employment is temporarily stopped - these data are discontinued from May 1999 onwards. <br...|$|R
