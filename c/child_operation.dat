5000|$|Following {{the break}} {{up of the}} first sex ring in May 2012, the police made arrests in {{relation}} to another child sexual exploitation ring in Rochdale. Nine men between 24 and 38 years old were arrested on suspicion of sexual activity with a <b>child.</b> <b>Operation</b> Doublet was launched {{at the same time}} as an investigation into child grooming and sexual abuse in the region. Assistant Chief Constable Steve Heywood said that about 550 officers were working on Operation Doublet in May 2013. He said the investigation was at [...] "an extremely sensitive stage" [...] and street grooming was the force's top priority, [...] "a bigger priority than gun crime". He said the investigation was looking at cases in Rochdale dating back to 2003.|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} 60 -year-old male with {{pancreatic}} head cancer presenting myocardial stunning {{just after the}} modified <b>Child</b> <b>operation.</b> He had neither a history of angina pectoris, nor electrocadiographic abnormalities before surgery. On 20 hours after surgery, 12 -lead electrocardiogram showed a typical pattern suggesting the existence of acute wide anterior myocardial infarction, that is, ST-elevation in leads Ⅰ, ₐⅤʟ, and Ⅴ₁～Ⅴ₆, although the patient had no chest pain. Emergent cardiac catheterization was performed, and revealed akinesis in the anterior wall on left ventriculogram, while there was no organic stenosis on coronary arteriogram. Peak value of creatinine kinase during his admission was just over the upper limit of normal. Left ventriculogram on the 34 th hospital day showed perfectly intact wall motion. Reversible myocardial infaction after abdominal surgery was first reported in 1976 by Kuramoto; however, the pathophysiology of this phenomenon still remains debatable. This is the first case report presenting myocardial stunning just after pancreatic surgery...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Literature {{on parents}} of {{children}} affected from cleft lip and/or palate has described the risk of higher levels of stress and anxiety during the pre-surgery period. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, just one study has empirically investigated the differences in the psychosocial adjustment of both mothers and fathers, but information on the pre-surgery period were not given. Given that, the aim of the current study is to evaluate the psychological functioning of both parents waiting for the <b>child</b> <b>operation.</b> Method Data from 34 Italian parents (F = 18; M= 16; Mean age = 36. 62, SD = 6. 07) of children affected by cleft lip and/or palate (Mean age = 12 months; SD. = 13. 75 months) were collected during the pre-hospitalization visits. The following questionnaires were administered, respectively to mothers and fathers: PSI-SF, MSPSS, PACQ, DAS and FACES-IV. Results Data shows no significant differences between fathers and mothers on the total score of each variable taken into account. Differently, significant differences emerge on the “Self Blame”PACQ subscales. Conclusions Mothers and fathers seem to share the same psychological experience during their child pre-surgery period. To note, our preliminary data highlight the maternal perception as featured by a greater sense of guilty for the child’s disease. The feeling of guilt may be a risk factor for the parental ability to cope with the experiences of the child’s illness, influencing parental care giving and parent-child relationship.

40|$|Background: School meals, if both nutritious and attractive, {{provide a}} unique {{opportunity}} to improve health equality and public health. Objective: To describe the study rationale, data collection, and background of participants in the study ‘Prospects for promoting health and performance by school meals in Nordic countries’ (ProMeal). The general aim was to determine whether overall healthiness of the diet and learning conditions in children can be improved by school lunches, and to capture the main concerns regarding school lunches among children in a Nordic context. Design: A cross-sectional, multidisciplinary study was performed in Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden on pupils (n= 837) born in 2003. Results: In total 3, 928 pictures of school lunches were taken to capture pupils’ school lunch intake. A mean of 85 % of all parents responded to a questionnaire about socioeconomic background, dietary intake, and habitual physical activity at home. Cognitive function was measured on one occasion on 93 % of the pupils during optimal conditions with a Stroop and a <b>Child</b> <b>Operation</b> Span test. A mean of 169 pupils also did an Integrated Visual and Auditory Continuous Performance Test after lunch over 3 days. In total, 37, 413 10 -sec observations of classroom learning behavior were performed. In addition, 753 empathy-based stories were written and 78 focus groups were conducted. The pupils had high socioeconomic status. Conclusions: This study will give new insights into which future interventions are needed to improve pupils’ school lunch intake and learning. The study will provide valuable information for policy making, not least in countries where the history of school meals is shorter than in some of the Nordic countries...|$|E

50|$|The Whipple {{procedure}} {{today is}} very similar to Whipple's original procedure. It consists of removal of the distal half of the stomach (antrectomy), the gall bladder and its cystic duct (cholecystectomy), the common bile duct (choledochectomy), the head of the pancreas, duodenum, proximal jejunum, and regional lymph nodes. Reconstruction consists of attaching the pancreas to the jejunum (pancreaticojejunostomy), attaching the common bile duct to the jejunum (choledochojejunostomy) to allow digestive juices and bile respectively to flow into the gastrointestinal tract, and attaching the stomach to the jejunum (gastrojejunostomy) to allow food to pass through. Whipple originally used the sequence: bile duct, pancreas and stomach, whereas presently the popular method of reconstruction is pancreas, bile duct and stomach, also known as <b>Child's</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|R

40|$|Study aim : {{to study}} the peculiarities of parents' {{emotional}} responses to the stress caused by their <b>child’s</b> hospitalization and <b>operation</b> to distinguish risk factors of losing personality potential by family members. Study participants and methods. The empirical study involved 82 parents (15 fathers and 67 mothers) and 76 children of preschool, primary school and juvenile age. A package of techniques involving analysis of medical cards, observation, structured conversation, mental stress calculation questionnaire, the “Incomplete sentences” technique, systematization of results and mathematical data treatment methods was defined. Theoretical analysis {{of the issue of}} emotional response of parents to stressful situations connected with their child’s congenital malformations and the need in operative intervention was made. Results. It was shown that all members of a family as a single system are subject to stress. The reaction of parents to their <b>child’s</b> <b>operation</b> depends on their personal characteristics, system of beliefs and life attitudes. Conclusions. The emotional condition of parents influences their child’s psychological condition and the efficacy of treatment. Supporting the family psychologically during pre- and post-operative stages allows to reduce the level of emotional discomfort of children and their parents. </p...|$|R
