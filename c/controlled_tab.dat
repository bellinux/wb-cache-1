Wing pitching moments are balanced by a smaller, external surface attached by a boom or equivalent structure. The external trimmer is, itself, a miniature free wing, and pitch control of the wing-trimmer assembly is effected through a trailing-edge <b>control</b> <b>tab</b> on the trimmer surface. The longitudinal behavior of representative small free-wing/free-trimmer aircraft was analyzed. Aft-mounted trimmer surfaces are found to be superior to forward trimmers, although the permissible trimmer moment arm is limited, in both cases, by adverse dynamic effects.

The effects of wing pivot location, wing chord, trailing-edge angle, propeller tilt angle, and thrust were studied, and a limited evaluation {{was made of}} high-lift devices. A dynamically similar wing was used to measure frequency and damping ratio from transient response data in the linear aerodynamic regime and the results were compared to quasi-steady and unsteady aerodynamic theory. It was found that at high trim angles of attack, in the nonlinear aerodynamic regime, stall flutter oscillations occurred with typical amplitudes ranging from 15 to 20 deg. Wing <b>control</b> <b>tab</b> deflection was effective in initiating and terminating stall flutter but variations in configuration or operating conditions did not greatly influence the occurrence of characteristics of the oscillations...|$|R
50|$|The {{elevator}} is a moveable part of {{the horizontal}} stabilizer, hinged {{to the back of}} the fixed {{part of the}} horizontal tail. The elevators move up and down together. When the pilot pulls the stick backward, the elevators go up. Pushing the stick forward causes the elevators to go down. Raised elevators push down on the tail and cause the nose to pitch up. This makes the wings fly at a higher angle of attack, which generates more lift and more drag. Centering the stick returns the elevators to neutral and stops the change of pitch. Some aircraft, such as an MD-80, use a servo tab within the elevator surface to aerodynamically move the main surface into position. The direction of travel of the <b>control</b> <b>tab</b> will thus be in a direction opposite to the main control surface. It is for this reason that an MD-80 tail looks like it has a 'split' elevator system.|$|R

40|$|No. 2606 * Surnrnary. [...] Oscillation of control-surface tabs has {{occurred}} in flight. General experience and the investigations of this report suggest that the oscillations were flutter, involving translation of the tab, arising from bending of the local control-surface structure, coupled with rotation of the tab about its hinge, arising from either backlash or elasticity of the <b>tab</b> <b>controlling</b> me&anism. Binary flutter calculations show that, for this coupling, the normal remedy, i. e. mass-balancing, is only partially effective (static mass-balancing roughly doubles the backlash flutter speed but may decrease the elastic flutter speed). If the <b>tab</b> <b>controlling</b> mechanism is adequately stiff, elimination of backlash gives higher flutter speeds than would be obtained by mass-balancing alone and in practice probably removes the danger of flutter. Flutter is completely prevented by aerodynamically balancing and dynamically mass-balancing (e. G. on hinge line) the tab. 1. I~troductio~. [...] 1. 1.

In the study, 36 Kunming mice were randomly divided into six groups: <b>control,</b> model, TAB-L (<b>TAB,</b> 5 mg/kg/day, i. g.), TAB-M (TAB, 20 mg/kg/day, i. g.), TAB-H (TAB, 40 mg/kg/day, i. g.) and omeprazole (OL, 10 mg/kg/day, i. g.). All mice except the control group were administrated with anhydrous alcohol (5. 0 mL/kg, i. g.) for induced gastric-ulcer 1 h after the 5 th day. At the same time, the control mice were given the same volume of physiological saline. After 4 h, TAB was evaluated for H+/K+-ATPase inhibitory activities of ulcerative gaster, gastric ulcer index and ulcer inhibition. In vitro, the anti-proliferation effect of TAB to gastric cancer cell (HGC- 27) in acid environment was detected by MTT, and the apoptosis morphological changes were also observed by Hoechst 33258 dye assay.
