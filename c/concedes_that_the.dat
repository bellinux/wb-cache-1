5|$|Copp {{wrote that}} Charnwood should have {{produced}} a rapid breakthrough but <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> battle {{was one of the}} most difficult of the campaign. Buckley singles out poor cooperation between armoured and infantry units as one of the reasons for such high Allied losses; he is critical of the habit of tanks standing off from German positions and firing the infantry onto the objective like artillery, instead of moving forward to give close support. He further notes that from the German perspective, the Anglo-Canadian forces apparently lacked the desire or ability to press home their advantages, citing Kurt Meyer's opinion that during the battle the Allies allowed the opportunity of destroying his 12th SS Panzer Division to elude them. Buckley comments on the defensive power of the British and Canadian formations. The German practice of conducting immediate local counter-attacks to retake lost ground cost them many of their best troops, losses they could ill-afford. He illustrates this with a typical action during which the Germans lost 13 tanks to British self-propelled anti-tank guns.|$|E
25|$|In , Harris {{writes that}} the purpose of spirituality (as he defines it – he <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> term's uses are diverse and {{sometimes}} indefensible) is to become aware that our sense of self is illusory, and says this realization brings both happiness and insight into the nature of consciousness. He argues this process of realization is based on experience and is not contingent on faith. In the same book, he describes his experience with Dzogchen, a Tibetan Buddhist meditation practice, and recommends it to his readers.|$|E
25|$|Trade {{liberalization}} may shift economic inequality from {{a global}} to a domestic scale. When rich countries trade with poor countries, the low-skilled {{workers in the}} rich countries may see reduced wages {{as a result of}} the competition, while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages. Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States. He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable. However, he <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts. Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality. They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper–Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes. Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15% of rising income inequality. Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low-skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations, and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries.|$|E

500|$|Various {{commentators}} {{are entirely}} dismissive {{of the visit}} and its importance. Th. Enescu describes its impact as [...] "amazing", since Péladan was merely an [...] "unusual [...] representative of French culture". He also proposes that the reception, with its [...] "noisy" [...] and [...] "exacerbated" [...] fanfare, shows the [...] "complexes of a provincial culture, confronted with the promiscuous exorbitance of a great culture". This assessment is quoted by literary historian Paul Cernat, who also notes Péladan's [...] "rather modest value" [...] should not have allowed such reactions. Cernat <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Péladan visit was important for promoting new cultural trends, specifically the notions of art for art's sake and decadence, even though this was done [...] "through the means of politics [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Jennens's {{letter to}} Holdsworth of 10 July 1741, {{in which he}} first {{mentions}} Messiah, suggests that the text was a recent work, probably assembled earlier that summer. As a devout Anglican and believer in scriptural authority, Jennens intended to challenge advocates of Deism, who rejected the doctrine of divine intervention in human affairs. Shaw describes the text as [...] "a meditation of our Lord as Messiah in Christian thought and belief", and despite his reservations on Jennens's character, <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> finished wordbook [...] "amounts to little short {{of a work of}} genius". There is no evidence that Handel played any active role in the selection or preparation of the text, such as he did in the case of Saul; it seems, rather, that he saw no need to make any significant amendment to Jennens's work.|$|E

Richard and Bruce Welch owned homes in Portugal near to the Andersons, {{and it was there}} that the two agreed to [...] "appear" [...] in the film as Supermarionation puppets. Also signed on to contribute to the film's score, Richard and the band recorded a song titled [...] "Shooting Star", with Richard providing the vocals, and an instrumental piece, [...] "Lady Penelope". Anderson <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sequence does not progress the plot, stating in her autobiography that it was [...] "sheer indulgence {{that would not have been}} possible on our television budget."

500|$|In the Journal of Political Economy, {{economic}} historian Stanley L. Engerman {{complains that}} the book is not [...] "written by or for economists" [...] and makes [...] "limited use of economic analysis". He continues, [...] "Given the concern with the 'personal autonomy' {{and culture of the}} slave, much of the book is devoted to the African heritage; to slave music, religion, and folklore; and to the discussion of the slave family and other personal relationships." [...] Engerman <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> <b>The</b> Slave Community [...] "is a book written at a time of transition in the interpretation of slavery and black culture", but [...] "the author at times seems unsure of the direction in which he is pointing." [...] He concludes that Blassingame's [...] "analysis is incomplete in its presentation of a different and more complex scene" [...] even though he [...] "effectively shows the difficulties of the concentration-camp image and the Sambo myth".|$|E
500|$|Historians {{disagree}} as to {{the strength}} of the evidence against Blackburn, and many of the federal and Confederate records relating to the case have been lost. Writing in the journal America's Civil War, U.S. Navy physician J. D. Haines notes that the Confederate agents who testified against Blackburn were of dubious reputation. Hyams in particular received immunity from prosecution and was paid for his testimony. Haines also points out that Blackburn's previous reputation as a humanitarian was ignored; in the hysteria following Lincoln's assassination, conspiracy theories abounded and Northerners were inclined to believe the worst about anyone with Confederate sympathies. The New York Times vilified Blackburn as [...] "The Yellow Fever Fiend" [...] and [...] "a hideous devil". Historian Edward Steers <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> evidence against Blackburn was circumstantial, but in his book Blood on the Moon, he contends that enough evidence survives not only to prove Blackburn's involvement in the plot, but to show that high-ranking Confederate officials up to and including President Jefferson Davis were aware of, condoned, and financed it. If true, Blackburn's plot would have represented one of the earliest attempts at biological warfare.|$|E

500|$|Inevitably, the Manual {{became a}} {{lightning}} rod for controversy. [...] Some observers took issue with its perspective on Canada; most notably, The Cambridge Companion to Canadian Literature criticizes its [...] "condescending tone" [...] in describing Canada's resources. [...] Elements in the U.S. and Canadian governments may have been upset by the Manual. [...] According to journalist Lynn Coady, the FBI and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) attempted to wiretap the House of Anansi Press's offices. [...] In addition, Anansi co-founder Dave Godfrey is convinced a 10-day government audit of the press was generated by FBI–RCMP concerns. [...] Many people did not want the Programme to encourage draft-eligible Americans to emigrate to Canada, and Satin routinely denied that the Manual encouraged emigration. [...] But few observers believed him, then or later. [...] The first sentence of an article in The New York Times from 1968 describes the Manual as [...] "a major bid to encourage Americans to evade military conscription". [...] Canadian essayist Robert Fulford remembers the Manual as offering an enthusiastic welcome to draft dodgers. [...] Even a House of Anansi Press anthology from 2007 <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Manual is [...] "coyly titled".|$|E
500|$|Following the {{resolution}} of Karen and David's storyline in the pilot, in which David <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> couple need to hire a nanny, Jacey Salles was cast as Ramona Ramirez. Salles was a bit-part actress in BBC sitcoms and had previously appeared in the 1998 Granada film The Misadventures of Margaret, which was co-produced by Harries. In her Cold Feet audition she was required to have a loud argument with her boyfriend over the telephone. She embellished this with [...] "a bit of comic bastardisation of the English language" [...] and won the part. Initially contracted for only two episodes, Salles assumed the Marsdens would employ a new nanny every few episodes, though she made two more appearances in the first series and eventually appeared in every series. Lennie James made two guest appearances as Kris Bumstead, though his second appearance in Episode 6 was mostly {{in the form of}} flashbacks. James was keen to find out {{the resolution}} to the [...] "who's the father?" [...] cliffhanger, reportedly repeatedly asking the producers whether the baby was Kris's. Other actors to make appearances were Denis Lawson as Alexander Welch and Sam Kelly as Algernon Gifford. John Thomson was pleased to work with Kelly, as he was a big fan of 'Allo 'Allo!, a sitcom in which Kelly appeared.|$|E
500|$|In the Fall 1996 {{issue of}} Raritan Quarterly Review, Stephen D. Cox, freely admitting to never having read the book, {{nonetheless}} called Terhune a [...] "hack writer" [...] who lacked [...] "storytelling skill" [...] and denounced Lad: A Dog as non-literature with [...] "sentences [...] are insufferably stilted and hammy" [...] and [...] "have {{a tendency to}} wander off on long romps with his personal obsessions." [...] Terming it a [...] "socially interesting" [...] work, he <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> novel has maintained [...] "intense and long-lasting" [...] interest from readers due to its successfully playing on their emotions and [...] "desire to have a collie dog." [...] He quotes Irving Litvag, author of Terhune's biography The Master of Sunnybank, stating that Lad [...] "became the dog we always wanted to have and never did. Maybe even more than that—maybe he became the friend we always waited to find, or even the brother, or the father." [...] In You're Only Young Twice: Children's Literature and Film, Timothy Morris felt the novel had [...] "dated badly" [...] due to changes in American society, and while he stated that he enjoyed the work, in comparing it to Anna Sewell's Black Beauty he faults Lad: A Dog for lacking an [...] "autobiographical frame" [...] and for leaving readers guessing {{as to what is}} happening.|$|E

500|$|The {{pastoral}} interlude {{that follows}} {{begins with the}} short instrumental movement, the Pifa, which {{takes its name from}} the shepherd-bagpipers, or pifferari, who played their pipes in the streets of Rome at Christmas time. Handel wrote the movement in both 11-bar and extended 32-bar forms; according to Burrows, either will work in performance. The group of four short recitatives which follow it introduce the soprano soloist—although often the earlier aria [...] "But who may abide" [...] is sung by the soprano in its transposed G minor form. The final [...] recitative of this section is in D major and heralds the affirmative chorus [...] "Glory to God". The remainder of Part I is largely carried by the soprano in B flat, in what Burrows terms a rare instance of tonal stability. The aria [...] "He shall feed his flock" [...] underwent several transformations by Handel, appearing at different times as a recitative, an alto aria and a duet for alto and soprano before the original soprano version was restored in 1754. [...] The appropriateness of the Italian source material for the setting of the solemn concluding chorus [...] "His yoke is easy" [...] has been questioned by the music scholar Sedley Taylor, who calls it [...] "a piece of word-painting... grieviously out of place", though he <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> four-part choral conclusion is a stroke of genius that combines beauty with dignity.|$|E
2500|$|In the past, Singer has {{not held}} that {{objective}} moral values exist, {{on the basis}} that reason could favour both egoism and equal consideration of interests. Singer himself adopted utilitarianism {{on the basis that}} people's preferences can be universalised, leading to a situation where one takes the [...] "point of view of the universe" [...] and [...] "an impartial standpoint".

2500|$|... "Save the World" [...] {{is held in}} low regard {{by several}} Harrison and Beatles biographers.

Ian Inglis echoes this view, deeming the lyrics [...] "trite {{to the point of being}} risible" [...] and the combination of an unfocused narrative and the overuse of sound effects to be as unsuccessful as the Beatles' work during the Magical Mystery Tour era. Although he <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> scarcity of environmental songs in the early 1980s, relative to the 1990s, might be a mitigating factor, Inglis dismisses the song as a [...] "hopelessly vague indictment of the perils we are inflicting around the globe", adding: [...] "The problem with such a general attack is that it lacks focus and, therefore, force." ...|$|E

2500|$|Simon Leng <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lyrics alone {{might make}} [...] "Hear Me Lord" [...] seem [...] "falsely pious" [...] yet, like Bruce Spizer, he {{recognises}} Harrison's [...] "clear" [...] sincerity {{reflected in his}} performance on the recording. [...] "Even more than 'My Sweet Lord'," [...] Leng writes, [...] "the closer to the album proper is the most emotionally compelling piece on an emotionally naked compilation. This is a true outpouring of feeling... A movingly impassioned vocal completes a picture that is as cathartic as anything on Lennon's Plastic Ono Band album." [...] Less convinced, Ian Inglis writes: [...] "the impression is of a man cowed, rather than liberated, by his faith." [...] Inglis notes an [...] "uneasy self-righteousness" [...] in Harrison's verse-one lines [...] "Forgive them Lord / Those that feel they can't afford you", and concludes: [...] "The song's gospel-tinged backing matches the evangelical nature of its sentiments, but [...] is a slightly unsettling end to a collection of songs of great power and passion." ...|$|E

But even under a stricter test, the ordinance was [...] "sufficiently clear." [...] No one doubted {{the meaning of}} the terms for cannabis or other illegal drugs; those were already and extensively defined in Illinois's state statutes. [...] "The Court of Appeals' speculation about the meaning of 'design' is largely unfounded," [...] he went on. Going with the dictionary definition of [...] "design" [...] as meaning [...] "to fashion according to a plan," [...] he observe that [...] "a business person of ordinary intelligence would understand that this term refers to the design of the manufacturer, not the intent of the retailer or customer." [...] While there were, he admitted, ambiguous terms in the guidelines and ordinances, he found the [...] "designed for use" [...] standard [...] "sufficiently clear to cover {{at least some of the}} items that Flipside sold," [...] in particular roach clips which have no legal use.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accounts}} in Geoffrey and Gerald make no special mention of Glastonbury. Instead, Gerald's {{letter from the}} clerics at StDavid's says that Fagan and [...] "Duvian" [...] were the first apostles of all Britain, baptising its king Lucius and then converting all his subjects after their arrival in 140. It says 27 pagan leaders were replaced by {{the same number of}} bishops and 3 archbishops placed over them, including one at St Davids. It advances these points in favor of its independence from Canterbury, a particular project of Bishop Bernard (1115–). Geoffrey also treats Fagan and [...] "Duvian" [...] as the first apostles to Britain, noting their conversion of Lucius's petty kings and success at [...] "almost" [...] removing paganism from the whole island until the Great Persecution under Diocletian. He states that the pagan temples were remade into churches and 28 [...] "flamens" [...] and 3 [...] "archflamens" [...] were replaced by 28 bishops under the 3 archbishops of London (over Loegria and Cornwall), York (over Deira and Albania), and Caerleon (over Wales). Fagan and [...] "Duvian" [...] were then said to have personally returned to Rome for confirmation of their work, returning again with still more clerics. This all supposedly occurred before the death of Lucius in 156. Gerald elsewhere <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> archbishop was initially at Caerleon but claims it was eventually moved to Menevia (St Davids). He states the early archbishops administered twelve suffragans each and each oversaw one of the five Roman provinces of Britain: Britannia Prima (Wales), Britannia Secunda (Kent), Valentia (Scotland), Flavia (Mercia), and Maxima (York). He further concedes, however, his knowledge of the time was mostly based on [...] "common report" [...] and not certain history.|$|E
