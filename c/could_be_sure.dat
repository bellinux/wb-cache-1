5|$|Over {{the months}} and years that followed, {{commentators}} questioned the accuracy of France2's report. The Israel Defense Forces accepted responsibility for the shooting at first but later retracted. French journalists who saw the raw footage confirmed that France2 had cut a final few seconds in which Muhammad appeared to lift his hand from his face; they acknowledged that he had died, but said the footage alone did not show it. France2's news editor said in 2005 that no one <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> who fired the shots. Other commentators, particularly Philippe Karsenty, a French media commentator, went further, alleging that the scene had been staged by Palestinian protesters; France 2 sued him for libel and in 2013 he was fined €7,000 by the Court of Appeal of Paris. In May that year an Israeli government report supported Karsenty's view. Jamal al-Durrah and Charles Enderlin rejected its conclusion and called for an independent international investigation.|$|E
5|$|At 09:00 Linois {{was still}} only observing the convoy, {{reluctant}} to attack until he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> {{of the nature}} of his opponents. Dance responded to the reprieve by reforming the line of battle into sailing formation to increase his convoy's speed with the intention of reaching the Straits ahead of Linois. With the convoy a less intimidating target, Linois began to slowly approach the British ships. By 13:00 it was clear that Linois's faster ships were in danger of isolating the rear of the convoy, and Dance ordered his lead ships to tack and come about, so that they would cross in front of the French squadron. The British successfully executed the manoeuvre, and at 13:15 Linois opened fire on the lead ship—Royal George—under the command of John Fam Timmins. The Royal George and the next four ships in line, the Indiaman Ganges, Dance's Earl Camden, the Warley and the Alfred, all returned fire, Ganges initially attacking Royal George in error. Captain James Prendergrass in Hope, the next in line, was so eager to join the battle that he misjudged his speed and collided with Warley, the ships falling back as their crews worked to separate their rigging. Shots were then exchanged at long range for 43 minutes, neither side inflicting severe damage.|$|E

Weart's {{history of}} The Discovery of Global Warming states that: While neither {{scientists}} nor the public <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> in the 1970s whether {{the world was}} warming or cooling, people were increasingly inclined to believe that global climate was on the move, and in no small way.|$|E

25|$|Huxley {{was also}} {{an active member of}} the Metaphysical Society, which ran from 1869 to 1880. It was formed around a nucleus of clergy and {{expanded}} to include all kinds of opinions.

25|$|Motivations {{behind the}} {{volunteering}} nature were not solely patriotic, but also commonly economic. Many men who joined as volunteers {{and went on}} to serve with the regular army were unemployed urban dwellers, and prospects of a standard income were better than none at all. Tradesmen <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> to make a tidy profit from selling their wares to the soldiers, and sutlers often became camp followers, following a regiment, whilst on campaign. Certainly more applicable to the landed and wealthy gentlemen, fears of invasion also persuaded many to serve; not so much to support the nation as a whole, but to preserve their own interests, money and property which could be lost if the enemy succeeded.|$|E

25|$|The {{great success}} of Reese on Play (an {{outstanding}} guide to dummy play and defence) {{was followed by}} an even more ambitious work. The Expert Game was the book which really made his name. As the title suggests, it dealt with card play at the highest level, including some ideas that were novel at the time, for instance, inferences from events that did not occur, and the principle of restricted choice. Examples of bridge logic abound in Reese, for instance, a player who overcalls but does not lead his suit is likely to lack one or two key honours; this concept is often called 'the dog that did not bark in the night' (after Sherlock Holmes in Arthur Conan Doyle's Silver Blaze). Another form of logic {{can be seen in}} 'If it must be so, assume it is so'. His examples of counting (and other ways of drawing inferences from the bidding and play) spread such ideas from a coterie of masters in London (or New York) to a much wider group of nascent experts. For at least twenty years after this book was published, one <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that virtually every top-class player had studied it minutely.|$|E
500|$|Lane ran for Governor of California in 1902 on the Democratic and Non-Partisan tickets. [...] At a {{time when}} California was {{dominated}} by the Republican Party, he lost by less than a percentage point to George Pardee. (Theodore Roosevelt won the state by 35points two years later.) [...] Between 8,000 and 10,000votes were disqualified on various technicalities, possibly costing him the election. [...] During the campaign, the influential San Francisco Examiner slanted its news coverage against him. [...] Examiner owner William Randolph Hearst later denied responsibility for this policy, and stated that if Lane ever needed anything, he should send Hearst a telegram. [...] Lane retorted that if Hearst received a telegram purportedly signed by Lane, asking him to do anything, he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> it was a forgery.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the immense}} {{difficulties}} {{involved in the}} development of such a railway, steady progress was made, and by 23 July 1897 the track stretched 103 miles into the desert. Here, however, progress was halted, for fear of coming within range of Mahdist raids from Abu Hamed. Work on the railway could not resume until the town had been taken; the entire campaign was stalled, awaiting the completion of the line to begin the general advance. As well, every delay offered greater chances for disaster; if the Mahdists were alerted to Kitchener's plans, the whole operation would be jeopardized and the catastrophic fate of General Gordon's expedition potentially repeated. In May a scouting mission under Captain Le Gallais had reconnoitered the area surrounding Abu Hamed, reporting that the town was weakly defended and the Mahdist presence throughout the area fairly slim, though the Khalifa's forces had been moving recently and no one <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> reinforcements were not on the way. Kitchener had to act fast; in late July he informed the respected and accomplished Major-General Sir Archibald Hunter that he had been selected to lead the assault.|$|E

500|$|At Madras Admiral Rainier [...] {{had become}} {{increasingly}} concerned during September by Linois's depredations, and {{had decided to}} strengthen his convoy escorts. He [...] replaced Wilhelmina with the 50-gun HMS Centurion. Centurion was under the nominal command of Captain John Sprat Rainier, who was seriously ill at Madras, so Captain James Lind assumed temporary command. Lind sailed from Madras to Vizagapatam earlier in the month with the Indiamen Barnaby and Princess Charlotte and anchored in the roads, while the Indiamen loaded cargo ready for the return journey to Madras. The ships were still anchored in the roads at 06:00 on 15 September when Linois's squadron appeared on the horizon to the south-west, approximately [...] away. The only flag visible on the strange ships was on board one of the frigates, which displayed the St George's Cross. Lieutenant James Robert Phillips, in command of Centurion while Lind was ashore, was not convinced by this ensign: {{he was aware that}} a French squadron was in the region, and positioned his ship so that his broadside faced the approaching vessels. At 09:45 the French came within range and Phillips opened fire, cautiously at first until he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> of the identity of the strangers.|$|E

2500|$|While {{it would}} have been {{possible}} to use some of these pins for the sort of command-switching they needed (the [...] "ready" [...] indications, for example, would have sufficed) Heatherington instead {{came up with the idea}} of using a rarely seen sequence of characters for this duty.

2500|$|However, a more {{contemporary}} account, not dulled by {{the passage of}} 40 years, has subsequently surfaced. In 1965, {{a member of the}} 1960 Chinese expedition, Wang Fu-chou gave a lecture in the headquarters of the USSR Geographical Society in Leningrad. While describing the expedition, Wang Fu-chou made a sensational remark, [...] "At an altitude of about 8,600 meters we found a corpse of a European". Asked how he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> the dead man was European, the Chinese climber replied simply, [...] "He was wearing braces".|$|E
2500|$|In 1940, {{in order}} to ensure Egypt's support of the war effort, which {{initially}} seemed to be going very badly for the Allies, Britain replaced the Egyptian government with one whose cooperation it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> of. [...] Martial law was imposed, and in 1941 some public figures that Britain considered subversive were arrested. [...] Hassan al-Banna was imprisoned twice (only to be released within weeks), the Brotherhood's journals were suppressed, its meetings were banned and any reference to it in newspapers was forbidden.|$|E

Scots noblemen had promised twenty-five thousand Highlanders and five thousand horses.|$|E
2500|$|The {{unemployment}} rate was about 25% and higher in major industrial and mining centers. Farm income had fallen by over 50% since 1929. An estimated 844,000 non-farm mortgages had been foreclosed between 1930–33, {{out of five}} million in all. Political and business leaders feared revolution and anarchy. Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., who remained wealthy during the Depression, stated years later that, [...] "in those days I felt and said I {{would be willing to}} part with half of what I had if I <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> of keeping, under law and order, the other half".|$|E
2500|$|A {{decision}} on the renewal of Trident was made on 4 December 2006. Prime Minister Tony Blair told MPs it would be [...] "unwise and dangerous" [...] for the UK {{to give up its}} nuclear weapons. He outlined plans to spend up to £20bn on a new generation of submarines for Trident missiles. He said submarine numbers may be cut from four to three, while the number of nuclear warheads would be cut by 20% to 160. Blair said although the Cold War had ended, the UK needed nuclear weapons, as no-one <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> another nuclear threat would not emerge in the future.|$|E
