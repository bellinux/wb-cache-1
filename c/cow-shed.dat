5|$|The 1980s saw {{the festival}} become an annual fixture, barring {{periodic}} fallow years. In 1981, Michael Eavis {{took control of}} the festival, and it was organised in conjunction with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). That year a new Pyramid Stage was constructed from telegraph poles and metal sheeting (repurposed from materials of the Ministry of Defence), a permanent structure which doubled as a hay-barn and <b>cow-shed</b> during the winter.|$|E
60|$|Outside, {{they heard}} the mountaineer calling loudly, {{although}} they {{could not make out}} what was being said. There was a commotion in the sheepfold and also in the <b>cow-shed.</b> Then came a crashing sound, and from the <b>cow-shed</b> came one of the horses.|$|E
6000|$|... "Goin' {{to offer}} any reward for capturin' that feller?" [...] {{questioned}} the older {{of the two}} boys, when the four {{were on their way}} back to the <b>cow-shed.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Found a man slinking {{around the}} <b>cow-shed</b> a while ago," [...] he said. [...] "He {{looked like a}} tramp. I {{wanted to talk to}} him, but he scooted in double-quick order." ...|$|E
60|$|In the <b>cow-shed</b> {{the boys}} were {{blacking}} their faces for a dress-rehearsal; the turkey hung dead, with opened, speckled wings, in the dairy. The time was come to make pies, in readiness.|$|E
60|$|Inside {{of fifteen}} minutes {{he came around}} to the <b>cow-shed</b> with a big, low sleigh, to which were {{attached}} four fine-looking horses. The sleigh contained two lanterns and a quantity of wraps and robes.|$|E
60|$|Dave {{was correct}} in his surmise, {{and soon the}} boys {{approached}} a big <b>cow-shed,</b> through a window of which they saw the faint rays of a lantern. Just as they did this they heard a voice cry out in wonder.|$|E
60|$|But {{the hardships}} of the storm {{were not to be}} endured for long. A quarter of a mile further on they came to a large farmhouse, {{situated}} some little distance back from the road. In the rear was a barn and a <b>cow-shed.</b>|$|E
60|$|It {{was rather}} a toilsome {{journey to the}} farmhouse. Between them and the place were a barn and a <b>cow-shed,</b> and just as they passed the former there arose a fierce barking, and three big black dogs came {{bounding}} toward the students.|$|E
60|$|Then the {{children}} became absorbed in seeking {{for a place}} where their fowls could find safe shelter from the enemies that lurked in the wood, and ended by an attempt of Stead's to put up some perches across the beam above the <b>cow-shed.</b>|$|E
60|$|About {{the middle}} of the night came a great disturbance, and in a minute the {{household}} was in an uproar. They heard the mountaineer call to his wife, and then, lantern in hand, he rushed outside and toward the sheepfold, back of the <b>cow-shed.</b>|$|E
6000|$|There {{being no}} {{depth of water}} close in shore, they landed from the vessel's boat, with all their goods beside them. There were a few log-houses visible among the dark trees; the best, a <b>cow-shed</b> or a rude stable; but for the wharves, the market-place, the public buildings-- ...|$|E
60|$|Leaving the {{building}} {{which they had}} first entered--an abandoned stable--they moved through a broken-down <b>cow-shed</b> to a long, low structure which had evidently {{been used by the}} helpers on the ranch. This building was also deserted, and all that remained in it was some filthy bedding alive with vermin.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Poyser had had {{her eyes}} fixed on her husband with cold {{severity}} during his silence, but now she turned away her head with a toss, looked icily at the opposite roof of the <b>cow-shed,</b> and spearing her knitting together with the loose pin, held it firmly between her clasped hands.|$|E
6000|$|He {{turned to}} Carol. [...] "Adolph Morgenroth, farmer ten miles {{southwest}} of town, got his arm crushed-fixing his <b>cow-shed</b> and a post caved in on him--smashed him up pretty bad--may have to amputate, Dave Dyer says. Afraid we'll have to go right from here. Darn sorry to drag you clear down there with me----" ...|$|E
60|$|A chest {{which he}} kept in the <b>cow-shed,</b> and which bore traces of {{the fire in the}} old house, had been brought down to serve as an Altar, and it was laid over, for want of {{anything}} better, with one of poor Mrs. Kenton's best table-cloths, which Patience had always thought too good for use.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is a bad}} road," [...] said he to Granbury Lapham, in Norwegian. [...] "A {{slip and}} a slide and {{we should all be}} killed. We must wait until the storm is over." [...] And so they put up at this hut by the roadside, and the horses were stabled in a <b>cow-shed</b> in the rear.|$|E
60|$|They had no regular stable, and {{the father}} left the boys to fit part of the <b>cow-shed</b> up for the pony, which they did by {{throwing}} part of the hen-coop open into it. The pigeon-cots were just over his head, and he never could have complained of being lonesome. At first everybody wanted to feed him as well as ride him, {{and if he had}} been allowed time for it he might have eaten himself to death, or if he had not always tried to bite you or kick you when you came in with his corn. After a while the boys got so they forgot him, and nobody wanted to go out and feed the pony, especially after dark; but he knew {{how to take care of}} himself, and when he had eaten up everything there was in the <b>cow-shed</b> he would break out and eat up everything there was in the yard.|$|E
60|$|Towards one o’clock {{the sound}} of rather boisterous and undisciplined carol-singing {{approached}} rapidly, {{and came to a}} sudden anchorage, apparently just outside the garden-gate. A motor-load of youthful “bloods,” in a high state of conviviality, had made a temporary halt for repairs; the stoppage, however, did not extend to the vocal efforts of the party, and the watchers in the <b>cow-shed</b> were treated to a highly unauthorised rendering of “Good King Wenceslas,” in which the adjective “good” appeared to be very carelessly applied.|$|E
60|$|This old castle, {{now used}} as a <b>cow-shed,</b> is the only record of antiquity at Grey Abbey; and yet the ancient family of the Greys have lived there for centuries. The first of them who possessed {{property}} in Ireland, obtained in the reign of Henry II, grants of immense tracts of land, stretching through Wicklow, Kildare, and the Queen's and King's Counties; and, although his descendants {{have been unable to}} retain, through the various successive convulsions which have taken place in the interior of Ireland since that time, anything like an eighth of what the family once pretended to claim, the Earl of Cashel, their present representative, has enough left to enable him to consider himself a very great man.|$|E
60|$|But healthy {{youth is}} re-active; {{and in an}} hour or two Thankful was down at the <b>cow-shed,</b> with her arms around the neck of her {{favorite}} heifer, to whom she poured out much of her woes, and from whom she won an intelligent sort of slobbering sympathy. And then she sharply scolded Caesar for nothing at all, and a moment after returned to the house with the air and face of a deeply injured angel, who had been disappointed in some celestial idea of setting this world right, but was still not above forgiveness,--a spectacle that sunk Major Van Zandt into the dark depths of remorse, and eventually sent him to smoke a pipe of Virginia with his men in the roadside camp; seeing which, Thankful went early to bed, and cried herself to sleep. And Nature possibly followed her example; for at sunset a great thaw set in, and by midnight the freed rivers and brooks were gurgling melodiously, and tree and shrub and fence were moist and dripping.|$|E
60|$|But {{because our}} land shows this {{readiness}} to be changed, all signs of permanence upon it raise a tender attachment instead of awe: some of us, at least, love the scanty relics of our forests, and are thankful if a bush {{is left of}} the old hedgerow. A crumbling bit of wall where the delicate ivy-leaved toad-flax hangs its light branches, or a bit of grey thatch with patches of dark moss on its shoulder and a troop of grass-stems on its ridge, is a thing to visit. And then the tiled roof of cottage and homestead, of the long <b>cow-shed</b> where generations of the milky mothers have stood patiently, of the broad-shouldered barns where the old-fashioned flail once made resonant music, while the watch-dog barked at the timidly venturesome fowls making pecking raids on the outflying grain--the roofs that have looked out from among the elms and walnut-trees, or beside the yearly group of hay and corn stacks, or below the square stone steeple, gathering their grey or ochre-tinted lichens and their olive-green mosses under all ministries,--let us praise the sober harmonies they give to our landscape, helping to unite us pleasantly with the elder generations who tilled the soil for us before we were born, and paid heavier and heavier taxes, with much grumbling, but without that deepest root of corruption--the self-indulgent despair which cuts down and consumes and never plants.|$|E
60|$|On deck, the {{confusion}} was equally great and destructive. Many {{of the boats}} were carried away. The great chain cables rolled from side to side, until they were actually polished bright by the friction, while they were a source of perpetual danger to the crew {{in the performance of}} their duties. The oil-tanks broke loose, and after tumbling about for a time, fell down through the upper hatchway. And the two cows that fell with their <b>cow-shed</b> down into the ladies' cabin were killed by the violence of the shock. The chief cook was flung against one of the paddle-boxes, and having put out his hand to save himself, had his wrist sprained. He was then flung towards the other side, and coming against a stanchion in the way, had his leg fractured in three places. One lady had a rib fractured; another her shoulder dislocated; another her wrist. These are only specimens, selected to show what the poor people were subjected to. It is said that there were twenty-two fractures altogether, among passengers and crew, besides innumerable cuts and bruises. The cabins were flooded to the depth of several feet, and broken articles of furniture floated about everywhere. The luggage in the luggage-room, which had not been secured, was hurled about, until trunks, boxes, valises, etcetera, striking against each other, and against the sides of the compartment, were utterly destroyed--the very leather of the trunks being torn into small shreds.|$|E
60|$|Plenty of life there, {{though this}} is the drowsiest time of the year, just before hay-harvest; {{and it is the}} drowsiest time of the day too, for it is close upon three by the sun, and it is half-past three by Mrs. Poyser's {{handsome}} eight-day clock. But there is always a stronger sense of life when the sun is brilliant after rain; and now he is pouring down his beams, and making sparkles among the wet straw, and lighting up every patch of vivid green moss on the red tiles of the <b>cow-shed,</b> and turning even the muddy water that is hurrying along the channel to the drain into a mirror for the yellow-billed ducks, who are seizing the opportunity of getting a drink with as much body in it as possible. There is quite a concert of noises; the great bull-dog, chained against the stables, is thrown into furious exasperation by the unwary approach of a cock too near the mouth of his kennel, and sends forth a thundering bark, which is answered by two fox-hounds shut up in the opposite cow-house; the old top-knotted hens, scratching with their chicks among the straw, set up a sympathetic croaking as the discomfited cock joins them; a sow with her brood, all very muddy as to the legs, and curled as to the tail, throws in some deep staccato notes; our friends the calves are bleating from the home croft; and, under all, a fine ear discerns the continuous hum of human voices.|$|E
6000|$|We {{lost our}} way, of course. I always {{do in the}} country, and it does make me so wild, because it is no use asking {{direction}} {{of any of the}} people you meet. One might as well inquire of a lodging-house slavey the way to make beds as expect a country bumpkin to know the road to the next village. You have to shout the question about three times before the sound of your voice penetrates his skull. At the third time he slowly raises his head and stares blankly at you. You yell it at him then for a fourth time, and he repeats it after you. He ponders while you count a couple of hundred, after which, speaking at the rate of three words a minute, he fancies you [...] "couldn't do better than--" [...] Here he catches sight of another idiot coming down the road and bawls out to him the particulars, requesting his advice. The two then argue the case for {{a quarter of an hour}} or so, and finally agree that you had better go straight down the lane, round to the right and cross by the third stile, and keep to the left by old Jimmy Milcher's <b>cow-shed,</b> and across the seven-acre field, and through the gate by Squire Grubbin's hay-stack, keeping the bridle-path for awhile till you come opposite the hill where the windmill used to be--but it's gone now--and round to the right, leaving Stiggin's plantation behind you; and you say [...] "Thank you" [...] and go away with a splitting headache, but without the faintest notion of your way, the only clear idea you have on the subject being that somewhere or other there is a stile which has to be got over; and at the next turn you come upon four stiles, all leading in different directions! ...|$|E
6000|$|Equally at the squire's table {{after the}} {{withdrawal}} of the ladies, at the farmers' market-ordinary, and at the village ale-house, the topic which, after the political question of the day, excites the most general interest, is the management of animals. Riding home from hunting, the conversation usually gravitates towards horse-breeding, and pedigrees, and comments on this or that [...] "good point;" [...] while a day on the moors is very unlikely to end without something being said on the treatment of dogs. When crossing the fields together from church, the tenants of adjacent farms are apt to pass from criticisms on the sermon to criticisms on the weather, the crops, and the stock; and thence to slide into discussions on the various kinds of fodder and their feeding qualities. Hodge and Giles, after comparing notes over their respective pig-styes, show by their remarks that they have been observant of their masters' beasts and sheep; and of the effects produced on them by this or that kind of treatment. Nor is it only among the rural population that the regulations of the kennel, the stable, the <b>cow-shed,</b> and the sheep-pen, are favourite subjects. In towns, too, the numerous artisans who keep dogs, the young men who are rich enough to now and then indulge their sporting tendencies, and their more staid seniors who talk over agricultural progress or read Mr. Mechi's annual reports and Mr. Caird's letters to the Times, form, when added together, {{a large portion of the}} inhabitants. Take the adult males throughout the kingdom, and a great majority will be found to show some interest in the breeding, rearing, or training of animals, of one kind or other.|$|E
6000|$|... "YOUNG MOTHER."--And so {{you think}} a baby {{is a thing of}} beauty and a joy forever? Well, the idea is pleasing, but not original; every cow thinks the same of its own calf. Perhaps the cow may not think it so elegantly, but still she thinks it nevertheless. I honor the cow for it. We all honor this {{touching}} maternal instinct wherever we find it, be it in the home of luxury or in the humble <b>cow-shed.</b> But really, madam, when I come to examine the matter in all its bearings, I find that the correctness of your assertion does not assert itself in all cases. A soiled baby, with a neglected nose, cannot be conscientiously regarded as a thing of beauty; and inasmuch as babyhood spans but three short years, no baby is competent to be a joy [...] "forever." [...] It pains me thus to demolish two-thirds of your pretty sentiment in a single sentence; but the position I hold in this chair requires that I shall not permit you to deceive and mislead the public with your plausible figures of speech. I know a female baby, aged eighteen months, in this city, which cannot hold out as a [...] "joy" [...] twenty-four hours on a stretch, let alone [...] "forever." [...] And it possesses some of the most remarkable eccentricities of character and appetite that have ever fallen under my notice. I will set down here a statement of this infant's operations (conceived, planned, and carried out by itself, and without suggestion or assistance from its mother or any one else), during a single day; and what I shall say can be substantiated by the sworn testimony of witnesses.|$|E
60|$|The {{ceremony}} of pressing noses having been duly completed with all present, we seated {{ourselves in a}} circle {{in the front of}} one of the-hovels, and rested there half an hour. All the hovels have nearly the same form and dimensions, and all agree in being filthily dirty. They resemble a <b>cow-shed</b> with one end open, but having a partition a little way within, with a square hole in it, making a small gloomy chamber. In this the inhabitants keep all their property, and when the weather is cold they sleep there. They eat, however, and pass their time in the open part in front. My guides having finished their pipes, we continued our walk. The path led through the same undulating country, the whole uniformly clothed as before with fern. On our right hand we had a serpentine river, the banks of which were fringed with trees, and here and there on the hill-sides there was a clump of wood. The whole scene, in spite of its green colour, had rather a desolate aspect. The sight of so much fern impresses the mind with an idea of sterility: this, however, is not correct; for wherever the fern grows thick and breast-high, the land by tillage becomes productive. Some of the residents think that all this extensive open country originally was covered with forests, and that it has been cleared by fire. It is said, that by digging in the barest spots, lumps of the kind of resin which flows from the kauri pine are frequently found. The natives had an evident motive in clearing the country; for the fern, formerly a staple article of food, flourishes only in the open cleared tracks. The almost entire absence of associated grasses, which forms so remarkable a feature in the vegetation of this island, may perhaps be accounted for by the land having been aboriginally covered with forest-trees.|$|E
6000|$|I {{hoped that}} if I made {{believe to be}} asleep she would get discouraged. So I closed the window ostentatiously, {{and went back to}} bed. But it only had the effect of putting her on her mettle. [...] "He did not care for that last," [...] I {{imagined}} her saying to herself, [...] "I wasn't at my best. There wasn't feeling enough in it." [...] She kept it up for about half an hour, and then the gate against which, I suppose, she had been leaning, gave way with a crash. That frightened her, and I heard her gallop off across the field. I was on the point of dozing off again when a pair of pigeons settled on the window-sill and began to coo. It is a pretty sound when you are in the mood for it. I wrote a poem once--a simple thing, but instinct with longing--while sitting under a tree and listening to the cooing of a pigeon. But that was in the afternoon. My only longing now was for a gun. Three times I {{got out of bed and}} [...] "shoo'd" [...] them away. The third time I remained by the window till I had got it firmly into their heads that I really did not want them. My behaviour on the former two occasions they had evidently judged to be mere playfulness. I had just got back to bed again when an owl began to screech. That is another sound I used to think attractive--so weird, so mysterious. It is Swinburne, I think, who says that you never get the desired one and the time and the place all right together. If the beloved one is with you, it is the wrong place or at the wrong time; and if the time and the place happen to be right, then it is the party that is wrong. The owl was all right: I like owls. The place was all right. He had struck the wrong time, that was all. Eleven o'clock at night, when you can't see him, and naturally feel that you want to, is the proper time for an owl. Perched on the roof of a <b>cow-shed</b> in the early dawn he looks silly. He clung there, flapping his wings and screeching at the top of his voice. What it was he wanted I am sure I don't know; and anyhow it didn't seem the way to get it. He came to this conclusion himself at the end of twenty minutes, and shut himself up and went home. I thought I was going to have at last some peace, when a corncrake--a creature upon whom Nature has bestowed a song like to the tearing of calico-sheets mingled with the sharpening of saws--settled somewhere in the garden and set to work to praise its Maker according to its lights. I have a friend, a poet, who lives just off the Strand, and spends his evenings at the Garrick Club. He writes occasional verse for the evening papers, and talks about the [...] "silent country, drowsy with the weight of languors." [...] One of these times I'll lure him down for a Saturday to Monday and let him find out what the country really is--let him hear it. He is becoming too much of a dreamer: it will do him good, wake him up a bit. The corncrake after awhile stopped quite suddenly with a jerk, and for quite five minutes there was silence.|$|E
6000|$|It {{is true that}} an observer, {{under that}} {{softening}} influence {{of the fine arts}} which makes other people's hardships picturesque, might have been delighted with this homestead called Freeman's End: the old house had dormer-windows in the dark red roof, two of the chimneys were choked with ivy, the large porch was blocked up with bundles of sticks, and half the windows were closed with gray worm-eaten shutters about which the jasmine-boughs grew in wild luxuriance; the mouldering garden wall with hollyhocks peeping over it was a perfect study of highly mingled subdued color, and there was an aged goat (kept doubtless on interesting superstitious grounds) lying against the open back-kitchen door. The mossy thatch of the <b>cow-shed,</b> the broken gray barn-doors, the pauper laborers in ragged breeches who had nearly finished unloading a wagon of corn into the barn ready for early thrashing; the scanty dairy of cows being tethered for milking and leaving one half of the shed in brown emptiness; the very pigs and white ducks seeming to wander about the uneven neglected yard as if in low spirits from feeding on a too meagre quality of rinsings,--all these objects under the quiet light of a sky marbled with high clouds would have made a sort of picture which we have all paused over as a [...] "charming bit," [...] touching other sensibilities than those which are stirred by the depression of the agricultural interest, with the sad lack of farming capital, as seen constantly in the newspapers of that time. But these troublesome associations were just now strongly present to Mr. Brooke, and spoiled the scene for him. Mr. Dagley himself made a figure in the landscape, carrying a pitchfork and wearing his milking-hat--a very old beaver flattened in front. His coat and breeches were the best he had, and he would not have been wearing them on this weekday occasion if he had not been to market and returned later than usual, having given himself the rare treat of dining at the public table of the Blue Bull. How he came to fall into this extravagance would perhaps be matter of wonderment to himself on the morrow; but before dinner something {{in the state of the}} country, a slight pause in the harvest before the Far Dips were cut, the stories about the new King and the numerous handbills on the walls, had seemed to warrant a little recklessness. It was a maxim about Middlemarch, and regarded as self-evident, that good meat should have good drink, which last Dagley interpreted as plenty of table ale well followed up by rum-and-water. These liquors have so far truth in them that they were not false enough to make poor Dagley seem merry: they only made his discontent less tongue-tied than usual. He had also taken too much in the shape of muddy political talk, a stimulant dangerously disturbing to his farming conservatism, which consisted in holding that whatever is, is bad, and any change is likely to be worse. He was flushed, and his eyes had a decidedly quarrelsome stare as he stood still grasping his pitchfork, while the landlord approached with his easy shuffling walk, one hand in his trouser-pocket and the other swinging round a thin walking-stick.|$|E
50|$|A hayloft is a {{space above}} a barn, stable or <b>cow-shed,</b> {{traditionally}} used for storage of hay or other fodder {{for the animals}} below. Haylofts were used mainly before {{the widespread use of}} very large hay bales, which allow simpler handling of bulk hay.|$|E

50|$|Some of the {{original}} railway lines {{can be seen in}} the <b>cow-shed</b> floor of the prison farm, which in a previous incarnation was the railway workshop. The line of a section of the track between Fort Bridgewood and Fort Horsted can be seen from the air (for example on Google Earth), as it curves away in a south westerly direction from the junction of City Way and Marconi Way.|$|E
5000|$|On Monday, 17 January 1955 {{the school}} was opened under the principalship of Rev. H. F. Swann. It was called Naparima College, Tunapuna Branch, with an {{enrollment}} of 44 students and two teachers. The church hall on Sheriff Street {{was used as the}} classroom and the portion of the grounds and <b>cow-shed</b> were used for games and also for teaching as a classroom ( [...] the cow - shed that is).|$|E
50|$|On some farms {{the loose}} hay was {{stored in a}} barrack, shed, or barn, {{normally}} {{in such a way}} that it would compress down and cure. Hay could be stored in a specially designed barn with little internal structure to allow more room for the hay loft. Alternatively, an upper storey of a <b>cow-shed</b> or stable was used, with hatches in the floor to allow hay to be thrown down into hay-racks below.|$|E
50|$|The Revd C E Douglas had {{the idea}} of {{encouraging}} attendance at Sunday School by a system of stamp collecting. The stamps were originally printed in London. Douglas moved the enterprise to Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire where a local printer, Henry Rutherford, began producing the stamps. This was so successful that in July 1907 the Faith Press was founded, at first in a converted <b>cow-shed</b> behind a pub, but from 1910 in a converted brewery in Leighton Buzzard.|$|E
