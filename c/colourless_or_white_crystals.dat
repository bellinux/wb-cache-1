50|$|Lead(II) acetate (Pb(CH3COO)2), {{also known}} as lead acetate, lead diacetate, plumbous acetate, sugar of lead, lead sugar, salt of Saturn, or Goulard's powder, is a white {{crystalline}} chemical compound with a sweetish taste. It is made by treating lead(II) oxide with acetic acid. Like other lead compounds, it is toxic. Lead acetate is soluble in water and glycerin. With water it forms the trihydrate, Pb(CH3COO)2·3H2O, a <b>colourless</b> <b>or</b> <b>white</b> efflorescent monoclinic crystalline substance.|$|R

50|$|Crystals are monoclinic. They {{may have}} a {{characteristic}} coffin-shaped habit, but may also form simple rhombic prisms. Frequently, a crust of fine crystals will form with only {{the ends of the}} rhombs visible, making the crystals look like wedges. They have a perfect cleavage parallel to the plane of symmetry, on which the lustre is markedly pearly; on other faces the lustre is of the vitreous type. The mineral is usually <b>colourless</b> <b>or</b> <b>white,</b> but may be orange, brown, yellow, brick-red, or green due to inclusions of celadonite. It varies from transparent to translucent. Isomorphous with heulandite is the strontium and barium zeolite brewsterite.|$|R

The largest cocaine seizures were in South Australia and Queensland implying importations may become more prevalent outside New South Wales, which {{is regarded as the}} main importation and distribution point. Organised criminal networks both within and outside of Australia are facilitating the movement of cocaine with increasing levels of collaboration.

40|$|It {{would indeed}} be {{difficult}} to find a more beautiful natural formation than that revealed to us in the cave known as the Gem of Jenolan. It is reached by a passage from the Jubilee Cave, and has been divided by the architectural processes of the dissolved limestone into three compartments. The wall in the view is of pure white, but is covered with innumerable stalactites, some of which are exquisitely tinted, others are of snow-white. A peculiar coating, like hoar frost, increases the general beauty. The entire wall, from the floor to the dome-shaped roof, is thickly covered with this phenomenal growth. The dividing wall, between the lower chamber and the one above, consists of a steep incline, bordered by a glistening white fringe. Arrived there, one finds the wealth of natural beauty embodied in a forest of crystal stalactites. Over this compartment is the Victoria Bower, where we find a semi-transparent column, six feet high, around which are large amber <b>or</b> <b>white</b> <b>crystal</b> stalactites, relieved by smaller ones like coral. From its base, two feet in diameter, it tapers upwards by a succession of terraces to a narrower crown. Near is a smaller column, similarly formed, but embellished with eccentric sprays; and on the right is a translucent column, with a tint of pink. The crystalline effect of the formations in the Gem of Jenolan may be noticed in the stalactites and columns in the stereograph, which carries with it the realism of na ture. The dark lips on the glistening pendants indicate the amber tint with which they are adorned, while the resemblance of the limestone to hoar frost is plainly noticeable. The Gem of Jenolan has been aptly named. Nothing else at the Caves can surpass it in beauty, and, indeed, it is claimed {{to be one of the}} finest examples of natural beauty in the known world...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{will try to}} solve the {{controversial}} points still existing in respect to the species Alcyonium palmatum Pallas, Alcyonium acaule Marion and Alcyonium brioniense Kükenthal. I found that A. brioniense has to be regarded a synonym of A. acaule, and that A. palmatum adriaticum Kükenthal, 1907, (= A. adriaticum of Kükenthal, 1909) can neither be considered a geographical race nor a valid species. I wish to express my sincere thanks to Dr. L. D. Brongersma, director, and Drs. W. Vervoort and L. B. Holthuis, curators, of the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie at Leiden, to Prof. Dr. H. Engel, director, and Dr. J. H. Stock, curator, of the Zoölogisch Museum at Amsterdam, for placing material of their respective museums at my disposal and for their kind assistance.

OUTLINE OF THE LITERATURE CONCERNING ALCYONIUM ACAULE MARION AND A. BRIONIENSE KÜ KENTHAL In 1878 Marion distinguished between two types of Alcyonium, occurring in the Bay of Marseilles. The first type he called „les Alcyons des fonds vaseux", evidently since it is found on a muddy bottom. This type was characterized as follows: (a) the colony has a long sterile stalk (Marion, 1878, pl. 6 fig. 1); (b) the length of the colony is 23 cm and more; (c) usually the colour is palish, though sometimes it may be a dirty light-yellow, brown-red or bright vermilion; (d) the tegument is transparent and nearly colourless; (e) usually the zooids are <b>colourless</b> <b>or</b> slightly <b>white</b> <b>or</b> yellow, sometimes their spicules are reddish; (f) in the sterile stalk there are short...|$|R
