This research examines post-apartheid South Africa’s intergovernmental development planning system. In particular, the research sets out to examine the extent to which the shift in the conceptualisation of the IDP, from a municipal-specific plan to an instrument of intergovernmental alignment, has contributed in tackling the challenges associated with intergovernmental alignment. Employing qualitative methods, this research drew on Gauteng as a case study, and utilizes the provincial Departments for Education, Health and Housing. At a municipal level, Ekurhuleni Metro, Metsweding District and Emfuleni Local Municipalities are utilised to examine the state of intergovernmental alignment both vertically and horizontally. It is argued that the South African system of intergovernmental development planning is highly dependent on individual goodwill and centred around forums. This is identified as a fundamental flaw that has contributed to challenges of intergovernmental alignment South Africa faces. As a solution it is proposed that an institutionalised system of intergovernmental alignment be introduced, and, drawing from international practices, the various models in this regard are presented.
