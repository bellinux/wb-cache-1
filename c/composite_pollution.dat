40|$|Vol. 8, pp. 97 - 121, 1974 The {{pollution}} in the air is a complex mixture of chemical substances of varying toxicity of which the sulfur oxides are a principal component. Those components which pose the primary hazards to human health {{have not yet been}} fully identified, nor have their respective contributions to human disease been fully determined. Efficient and effective control strategies are dependent upon the identification and understanding of these toxic components. Ultimately, the goal of standard-setting should be the development of <b>composite</b> <b>pollution</b> indices rather than control of individual pollutants. Concentrations of SO 2 ' in the ambient air twice the current standards are associated with adverse health effects. A consider'able body of evidence suggests that there may be discernible human health effects from exposure to concentrations approximating the current standards. There is therefore no basis for'relaxation of the present standards for sulffr oxides at this time. Since the scientific basis for this judgment is incomplete, further scientific'information will, be required either to validate the present standards or to justify alteration of these standards...|$|E
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of 5 heavy metals, Cd, Pb, Ni, Zn and Cu, were determined in Moehringia trinervia (L.) Clairv. collected from several {{sites in the}} Niepołomice Forest. This area is polluted by the numerous industrial plants of Krakow, mainly by the steel mill situated near the eastern city limits. The composite index obtained from {{the contents of the}} assayed elements was the basis for delineating 4 pollution zones of the forest: the western zone, which has the highest heavy metal pollution (closest to the steel mill), with a <b>composite</b> <b>pollution</b> index from 0. 26 to 0. 43; two moderate zones with indexes from 0. 02 to O. 15 and from - 0. 02 to - 0. 12 and the least polluted zone in the eastern area of the forest with an index of - 0. 18 to - 0. 29. It was found that Moehringia is an exceptionally good cadmium accumulator. The concentration of this element in the above-ground parts of this plant averaged about 9 µg g - 1...|$|E

40|$|This article reviews {{different}} views of neo-classical and ecological economics on the sustainability of economic growth and welfare. Neo-classical economics concludes that, due to substitution and technical progress, consumption can be sustained even if production depends on a natural resource that is being depleted. If production depends on an essential, renewable resource, there is a level of consumption that can be sustained forever. Pollution lowers the level of consumption that can be sustained. If production depends on an exhaustible resource, recycling of waste is insufficient for sustaining consumption unless 100 % recycling is possible. Sustainable economic development is possible if the resource growth potential exceeds {{the sum of the}} discount rate minus the rate of exogenous technical progress and if resource productivity is sufficiently high. In addition, intial levels of environmental quality (a <b>composite</b> of <b>pollution</b> and natural resources) and man-made capital influence the possibilities for sustainable economic development. If the resource stock itself affects utility, or if irreversibilities occur, optimal consumption and extraction are lowered. Ecological economics states that: substitution possibilities are restricted, full recycling of waste is impossible, and the limited influx of solar energy poses an additional constraint on the level of production that can be sustained. Since the functions of the environment (production factor, consumer good and waste sink) are intertwined, this life support function poses a restriction on economic growth as well. In ecological economics development is viewed as an evolutionary process with continuous feedbacks between a changing economy and environment. Welfare is not merely the sum of discounted individual preferences but requires environmental compatibility and the explicit (collective) formulation of policies regarding the conservation of species, ecosystems and natural resources...|$|R
40|$|The current {{challenge}} on {{cooling system}} {{all over the}} world was reviewed. The adsorption cooling system is believed to be able to solve the problems of energy shortage and environmental <b>pollution.</b> <b>Composite</b> adsorbents synthesized from zeolite 13 X and CaCl 2 were investigated for applications in solar adsorption cooling systems. The effect of Ca-ion-exchange on the adsorption properties of zeolite 13 X was studied by different characterization techniques, including XRF, TGA, BET, BJH and XRD. Sodium ions in the zeolite structure were replaced by calcium ions by ion exchange. It was found that the Ca-ion-exchange process decreased the specific surface areas of the Ca-ion-exchanged zeolites while the total pore volumes were increased. The optimized Ca-ion-exchange condition existed when soaking zeolite 13 X in 46 wt% CaCl 2 solution for 24 hours. The increase in the total pore volume is good for further impregnating the zeolite with CaCl 2. A large difference in equilibrium water uptake, 0. 4 g/g, between 25 °C and 75 °C under 870 Pa was recorded for the 13 X/CaCl 2 composite adsorbent impregnated in 40 wt% CaCl 2 solution. This was 419 % of that of zeolite 13 X under the same condition. The 13 X/CaCl 2 composite adsorbent showed a high potential in replacing vapor compression chillers in producing chilled water for central air-conditioning systems. The performance of the adsorber using the zeolite 13 X/ water pair was also studied in numerical simulation. It was suggested that the adsorbate gas diffusion can be omitted in the future simulation. The zeolite bed thickness shall be limited to 10 mm to reduce the bad effect caused by the poor thermal conductivity of the zeolite. Muti-adsorber tube connected in parallel can be employed to provide enough cooling power {{and at the same time}} maintain a large SCP and COP. The desorption temperature should be about 200 °C for maximizing the COP...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} of {{assessing}} water quality from satellite data is introduced. The <b>composite</b> <b>pollution</b> index (CPI) was calculated from measured chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nutrient concentration. The relationships between CPI and 240 band combinations of SeaWiFS water-leaving radiance were analyzed and the optimal band combination for estimating CPI was chosen from the 240 band combinations. An algorithm for retrieval of CPI was developed using the optimal band combination, (L- 443 x L- 510) / (L- 412 + L- 490). The CPI was estimated from atmospherically corrected SeaWiFS data by employing the algorithm. Furthermore, the CPI value range for each water quality level was determined based on data obtained from 850 samples taken in the Pearl River Estuary. The remotely sensed CPIs were then transferred to water quality levels and appropriate maps were derived. The remotely sensed water quality level maps displayed a similar distribution of levels based on in situ investigation issued by the State Ocean Administration, China. This study demonstrates that remote sensing {{can play an important}} role in water quality assessment. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} {{the effect of}} intense human activities in suburbs on environmental quality, we obtained 758 measurements of the heavy metals in certain farmland soils of the Beijing suburbs. Multivariate statistical analysis and geostatistical analysis were used to conduct a basic analysis of the heavy metal concentrations, the distribution characteristics and the sources of pollution of the farmland soils in these suburbs. The results showed the presence of eight heavy metals in the agricultural soils at levels exceeding the background values for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn. In particular, all the measured Cr concentrations exceeded the background value, while As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn were present at 1. 13, 1. 68, 1. 95, 1. 43, 1. 63, 0. 79, 0. 92 and 1. 36 times their background values, respectively. The results of correlation, factor and spatial structure analyses showed that Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn were strongly homologous, whereas Cr and Hg showed a degree of heterogeneity. The analysis further indicated {{that in addition to}} natural factors, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in the soil were mainly associated with distribution from road traffic and land use status. Different agricultural production measures in the various areas were also important factors that affected the spatial distribution of the soil Cr concentration. The major sources of Hg pollution were landfills for industrial waste and urban domestic garbage, while the spatial distribution of As was more likely to be a result of <b>composite</b> <b>pollution.</b> The regional distribution of the heavy metals indicated that except for Cr and Hg, the high heavy metal levels occurred in districts and counties with higher organic matter concentrations, such as the northwestern and southeastern suburbs of Beijing. There was no significant Ni pollution in the agricultural soils of the Beijing suburbs...|$|E
40|$|Regional <b>composite</b> <b>pollution</b> and {{variation}} of atmospheric oxidizing ability are significant problems in Beijing {{and its surrounding}} areas. In particular, a southwest northeast prevailing wind makes nonlinear {{variation of}} ozone and its precursors complex. In this study, simultaneous measurements of surface ozone (O- 3), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) were carried out from August 2009 to June 2010 to investigate ozone level and precursor concentrations in Northern China. Gucheng (GC), Longtanhu (LTH) and Xinglong (XL) were selected to represent rural area, urban area and background area in North China Plain, respectively. The results showed {{that there were two}} peaks for primary pollutants (NOx and CO) at urban and rural areas, and the highest values appeared nearly on rush hours. There was a single peak for O- 3 and O-x with peak values appearing at afternoon. The primary pollutants at urban and rural areas were higher than those in background region. However, the concentration of secondary pollutant O- 3 at downwind background areas was much higher than other sites due to transportation. Diurnal variations of pollutants indicated that O- 3 and O-x had peak values at afternoon, while other primary pollutants showed two peak values nearly on rush hours. Furthermore, high concentrations of O- 3 and O-x at background site XL also implied a robust atmospheric oxidizing ability. A positive correlation was observed between CO and O- 3 at XL site, which implied that air masses to the site had a large loading of anthropogenic emission experiencing strong photochemical processing. The correlation between CO and O- 3 was negative at GC and LTH, which indicated that local emission of precursors had significant influence on the formation of ozone. There was a positive correlation between NOx and O-x at GC and XL, which implied that NOx contributed to the formation of ozone, while a negative correlation meant titration in urban site LTH neutralized the formation of ozone due to high level of NO.
