As churches grew rapidly with more new believers everywhere in the state, the Annual Assembly Session of Tripura Baptist Christian Union which was held in Subhash Nagar (North Tripura) on 23–26 February 1989 passed resolution that the Circles (e.g., South, Udaipur, Saisawm Sazai, and Sadar North) be given the full status of Associations. And it was how the Sadar North Baptist Association was established as an Association in the month of February 1989.|$|E

500|$|Thus, if P lies {{outside the}} circle, then P' lies within, and vice versa. When P {{is the same}} as O, the {{inversion}} is said to send P to infinity. (In complex analysis, [...] "infinity" [...] is defined in terms of the Riemann sphere.) Inversion has the useful property that lines and circles are always transformed into lines and circles, and points are always transformed into points. Circles are generally transformed into other <b>circles</b> <b>under</b> inversion; however, if a circle passes {{through the center of the}} inversion circle, it is transformed into a straight line, and vice versa. Importantly, if a circle crosses the circle of inversion at right angles (intersects perpendicularly), it is left unchanged by the inversion; it is transformed into itself.|$|E
500|$|In the hospital, as Buffy {{listens to}} the doctor confirm how Joyce died, the doctor says something, but the words [...] "I have to lie to you {{to make you feel}} better" [...] are spoken discordantly, as though, {{according}} to cinema scholar Katy Stevens, Buffy [...] "constructs what she believes to be an unmentionable truth—her culpability in her mother's death". In the same scene, Dawn is shot with a hand-held camera that drifts, giving her a slightly unreal moment as she struggles to believe, unlike what Buffy already knows, that her mother's body is down the hall on a steel table. The scene with Buffy and Tara sitting in the waiting room was noted by Rhonda Wilcox for its reality in showing Gellar as ragged and distinctly unglamorous, particularly because she had been presented in a specific way to attract male viewers and was a spokeswoman for Maybelline while Buffy aired. Buffy sits with <b>circles</b> <b>under</b> her eyes, unflattering hair, and slumped posture next to Tara, who had been criticized for being too heavy, despite her body type being more typical of women her age.|$|E
500|$|Having {{given up}} {{his pursuit of}} Skarginska, Bax {{returned}} to England; in January 1911 he married the pianist Elsita Luisa Sobrino (b. 1885 or 1886), daughter of the teacher and pianist, Carlos Sobrino, and his wife, Luise, née Schmitz, a singer. Bax and his wife lived first in Chester Terrace, Regent's Park, London, and then moved to Ireland, taking a house in Rathgar, a well-to-do suburb of Dublin. They had two children, Dermot (1912–1976) and Maeve Astrid (1913–1987). [...] Bax became known in Dublin literary <b>circles</b> <b>under</b> the pseudonym [...] "Dermot O'Byrne"; he mixed with the writer George William Russell and his associates, and published stories, verses and a play. Reviewing a selection of the prose and poetry reissued in 1980, Stephen Banfield found most of Bax's earlier poems [...] "like his early music, over-written, cluttered with the secondhand lumber of early Yeats, though the weakness is one of loosely chosen language rather than complexity." [...] Banfield had better things to say of the later poems, where Bax [...] "focuses matters, whether laconically and colloquially upon the grim futility of the 1916 Easter Uprising... or pungently upon his recurrent disillusionment about love." [...] Some of Bax's writings as O'Byrne were regarded as subversively sympathetic to the Irish republican cause, and the government censor prohibited their publication.|$|E

Yet while that's a bit valid, it's also an exciting and surprising finale, that actually offers some bigger shocks than season 1." [...] Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a mostly positive review, praising the reveal of Beaver as the murderer while being slightly critical of his reveal as Veronica's rapist. He wrote that [...] "as twists go, this was a good one" [...] and that [...] "Kyle Gallner makes the transition from goofy, kind of pathetic little brother to insane mastermind quite well—the <b>circles</b> <b>under</b> his eyes, specifically, which seemed to indicate anxiety before suddenly indicated darkness and insanity when seen in a new light." [...] Regarding the rape reveal, the reviewers wrote that [...] "On a narrative level, I was fine with it...it's still a big problem in an emotional sense. In general, rape is a difficult subject, and to see it used as a plot device creates problems on its own." [...] Kaiser summed up his review by writing, [...] "'Not Pictured' acts as an effective capstone for a chaotic season. Sure, it doesn't entirely work, but overall, it gets the job done with emotion and flair." ...|$|E

50|$|A quasicircle {{is defined}} as the image of a <b>circle</b> <b>under</b> a quasiconformal mapping of the {{extended}} complex plane. It is called a K-quasicircle if the quasiconformal mapping has dilatation K. The definition of quasicircle generalizes the characterization of a Jordan curve as the image of a <b>circle</b> <b>under</b> a homeomorphism of the plane. In particular a quasicircle is a Jordan curve. The interior of a quasicircle is called a quasidisk.|$|R
2500|$|Polk's {{time in the}} White House {{took its}} toll on his health. Full of enthusiasm and vigor when he entered office, Polk left office {{exhausted}} by his years of public service. He lost weight and had deep lines {{on his face and}} dark <b>circles</b> <b>under</b> his eyes. He is believed to have contracted cholera in New Orleans, Louisiana, on a goodwill tour of the South after leaving the White House. He died of cholera at his new home, Polk Place, in Nashville, Tennessee, at 3:15pm on June 15, 1849, three months after leaving office. He had never joined any church, but received a deathbed Methodist baptism. Initially buried in what is now Nashville City Cemetery, due to a legal requirement related to his infectious disease death, he was moved to a tomb on the grounds of Polk Place (as specified in his will) less than a year later. Polk's last words illustrate his devotion to his wife: [...] "I love you, Sarah. For all eternity, I love you." [...] She lived at Polk Place for 42 years after his death and died on August 14, 1891. His mother, Jane Knox Polk, died on January 11, 1852. In 1893, the bodies of President and Mrs. Polk were exhumed and relocated to their current resting place {{on the grounds of the}} Tennessee State Capitol in Nashville. Polk Place was demolished in 1900. In 2017, state legislative action was considered to relocate the Polk's remains to his father's home in Columbia, Tennessee.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 April 1963 Thresher, now {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Commander John Wesley Harvey, got underway from Portsmouth at 08:00 and rendezvoused with the submarine rescue ship [...] at 11:00 to begin its initial post-overhaul dive trials, {{in an area}} some [...] east of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. That afternoon Thresher conducted an initial trim dive test, surfaced and then performed a second dive to half test depth. It remained submerged overnight and re-established underwater communications with Skylark at 06:30 on 10 April to commence deep-dive trials. Following standard practice, Thresher slowly dived deeper as it traveled in <b>circles</b> <b>under</b> Skylark—to remain within communications distance—pausing every additional [...] of depth to check the integrity of all systems. As Thresher neared her test depth, Skylark received garbled communications over underwater telephone indicating [...] "...minor difficulties, have positive up-angle, attempting to blow", and then a final even more garbled message that included the number [...] "900". When Skylark received no further communication, surface observers gradually realized Thresher had sunk. By mid-afternoon a total of 15 Navy ships were {{en route to the}} search area. At 18:30, the Commander, Submarine Force Atlantic, sent word to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard to begin notifying next-of-kin—starting with Commander Harvey's wife, Irene Harvey—that Thresher was [...] "missing". By morning the next day all hope of finding Thresher was abandoned, and at 10:30 the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) went before the press corps at The Pentagon to announce that the submarine was lost with all hands. 35th President John F. Kennedy ordered all flags to be flown at half-staff on 12–15 April in honor of the 129 lost submariners and shipyard personnel.|$|E
