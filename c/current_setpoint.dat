40|$|Abstract—In the {{smelting}} {{process of}} fused magnesium furnaces (FMFs), frequent {{changes in the}} raw material granule size and impurity constituent will cause the arc resistance between {{the lower end of}} the electrode and the surface of the molten pool to vary, and thus, the smelt-ing currents fluctuate. Consequently, abnormal conditions, which can arise if the <b>setpoints</b> of electrode <b>currents</b> are not properly adjusted on time, will causethe performance to deteriorate or even the overall operation to stall. Through analysis of the characteristics of different operating con-ditions, this paper presents a data-driven abnormal con-dition identification and self-healing control system. The proposed system extracts the identification rules accord-ing to the current tracking error, as well as the rate and duration of the current fluctuations, and identifies the ab-normal conditions based on rule-based reasoning. The self-healing control is developed using case-based reasoning to correct the <b>current</b> <b>setpoints</b> based on the identification results. The outputs of the control loop track the cor-rected setpoints, thereby forcing the process to recover from the abnormal conditions. The proposed method and the developed control system have been applied to a real FMF, and substantial improvement is achieved with many benefits provided to the factory. The implementation results show that occurrence of abnormal conditions has been reduced by more than 50 %, and the product quality has been increased by more than 2 %.

40|$|Abstract—This paper aims at {{assessing}} the setpoint tracking performance of proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers for nonlinear single-input-single-output (SISO) process loops. A comparison is {{made between the}} actual system output and an artificial process output response derived from nonlinear system identification and a user defined closed loop transient specification. Nonlinear system identification is achieved by fitting routine operating closed loop data to nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) models to describe a closed loop process model and the servo model. Once the nonlinear models are established they are linearized to corresponding autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) models where they are incorporated into a controller performance strategy. The framework will allow for control practitioners to assess the <b>current</b> controller <b>setpoint</b> tracking performance for general nonlinear systems from a transient specification point of view.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 100 - 103. In {{the recent}} years, progress in {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM) led to the multifrequency imaging paradigm in which the cantilever-tip ensemble is simultaneously excited by several driving forces of different frequencies. By using multifrequency excitation, various interaction forces of different physical origin such as electronic interactions or chemical interactions can be simultaneously mapped along with topography. However, a multifrequency magnetic imaging technique has not been demonstrated yet. The difficulty in imaging magnetic forces using a multifrequency technique partly arises from difficulties in modulation of the magnetic tip-sample interaction. In the traditional unmodulated scheme, measurement of magnetic forces and elimination of coupling with other forces is obtained in a double pass measurement technique where topography and magnetic interactions are rapidly measured in successive scans with different tip-sample separations. This measurement scheme may suffer from thermal drifts or topographical artifacts. In this work, we consider a multifrequency magnetic imaging method which uses first resonant flexural mode for topography signal acquisition and second resonant flexural mode for measuring the magnetic interaction simultaneously. As in a fluxgate magnetometer, modulation of magnetic moment of nickel particles attached on the apex of AFM tip {{can be used to}} modulate the magnetic forces which are dependent on external DC fields through the nonlinear magnetic response of the nickel particles. Coupling strength can be varied by changing coil <b>current</b> or <b>setpoint</b> parameters of Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM) system.

40|$|A high {{temperature}} superconducting {{magnetic energy storage}} device (SMES) has been realised using a 350 m-long BSCCO tape wound as a ''pancake'' coil. The coil is mounted on a cryocooler allowing temperatures down to 17. 2 K to be achieved. The temperature dependence of coil electrical resistance R(T) shows a superconducting transition at T = 102. 5 K. Measurements of the V(I) characteristics were performed at several temperatures between 17. 2 K and 101. 5 K to obtain the temperature dependence of the critical current (using a 1 uV/cm criterion). Critical currents were found to exceed 100 A for T < 30 K. An electronic DC-DC converter was built {{in order to control}} the energy flow {{in and out of the}} superconducting coil.

40|$|Dead-time {{effect is}} one of the {{dominant}} sources of output current and voltage distortion for pulse width modulated (PWM) amplifiers. Practical switching devices have finite turnon and turn-off time. To avoid short circuit a blanking time is added between turn-off and turn-on of the complementary working switches in a switching-leg. The blanking time, also referred to as dead-time, results in a nonlinear voltage error of the PWM output stage. Especially high-precision applications that require accurate input current for positioning systems suffer from the dead-time effect. Extensive studies have been done on the analysis and elimination, minimization and compensation of dead-time in PWM converters. Most of these techniques rely on the detection of the polarity of the output current of the converter. By using only the polarity of the output current, the inductor current ripple is neglected, which is not sufficient for high-precision applications. In this paper nonlinear feedforward of the <b>current</b> <b>setpoint</b> is used to compensate the dead-time effect.

40|$|Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) were {{investigated}} {{with regard to}} their application as templates to control processes down to the nanometre length scale. With applications of SAM for electrochemical nanotechnology in mind, the range of aspects studied comprises patterning on different length scales, behaviour of SAMs under the conditions of electrochemical metal deposition, and the influence of the head and tail groups on formation and structure of SAMs. On a micrometre scale, laser scanning lithography (LSL) was used to pattern SAM covered Au surfaces. With this technique, localized regions of a SAM are desorbed by scanning the focal spot of a laser beam. Thermal desorption occurs {{as a result of the}} high substrate temperature produced by the laser pulses. Patterns with line width as small as 0. 9 µm were produced by LSL. It is demonstrated that SAM can not only be patterned by laser radiation but can also be rendered more passive as revealed by electrochemical metal deposition. Such blocking effect is explained by annealing of defects upon irradiation at the appropriate laser energy. This effect can block deposition of bulk copper particles, but does not prevent the underpotential deposition. Based on this passivation effect, large passivation areas can be created, which can be used as substrate for further nano/micro fabrication. The combination of SAM patterning and electrochemical metal deposition was also demonstrated to be an effective way to prepare superhydrophobic surfaces, exhibiting a contact angle of 165 ° (water droplet). Aiming for the generation of smaller structures, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is used as a tool to pattern SAMs. Several phenomena observed in STM based manipulation of SAMs are addressed. The first one is sweeping effect. Deposited metal particles on top of SAM and SAMs are swept by STM tip by choosing appropriate I/V parameters. The closer the tip (higher current, lower bias), the more effective it is. Molecularly resolved images confirm that after sweeping, the scanned area is still covered by SAM molecules. This is explained by diffusion. The sweeping process can be repeated, thus, resulting in a layer by layer etching. The second effect is field-induced desorption. Applying a positive voltage (2. 5 - 5 V), a SAM is damaged beneath the area of the tip. The damage depends not only on the bias applied, but also on the <b>current</b> <b>setpoint</b> right before applying the bias. The third effect is nanografting. Nanografting was observed that a SAM having a stronger assembling ability can replace the weaker one (matrix layer) in hexadecane solution by STM scanning under normal I/V parameters combination that are usually used for imaging. It is found that longer chain can replace the shorter chain thiol, alkanethiol can replace biphenyl thiol. This method can be applied to pattern SAM. Defects (punched holes) were created purposely on the SAMs covered Au surface and in situ STM was used to investigate the process of Under-Potential Deposition (UPD) and bulk metal deposition. Bulk metal deposition on punched holes depends on the size. Small scale patterning by punching is sufficient for applications based on UPD but not for bulk metal deposition. Several SAMs assembled on Au(111) surface (1 -mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA), Dodecyl Thiocyanate (C 12 SCN) and bis(pyrazol- 1 -yl) pyridine-substituted thiol (bpp-SH) and thiocyanate (bpp-SCN)) {{were investigated}} with the aim to expand the type of SAMs that can be used as template for further application, such as metal coordination. High quality thiolate monolayers formed by cleavage of the S-CN bond can be obtained on Au(111). Thus, organothiocyanates appear to be a promising alternative to thiols. Well-ordered MUA monolayers are formed in a few hours at the temperature range of 323 - 363 K by Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD). Self-assembled monolayers of bpp-SH and bpp-SCN on Au(111) /mica were studied with STM. Preparation conditions such as temperature, solvent, and contamination affect the formation of SAMs on Au(111) much more than other common thiols such as alkanethiols and biphenythiols.

STM tip-induced surface {{nanostructuring}} {{based on}} "Jump-to-contact" mechanism is a nanostructuring technique {{that has the}} highest resolution in aqueous solutions. However,for metals that have high cohesive energy,atoms would transfer from surface to tip instead,which limits the wide application of this technique. In this paper,we present a two-step Nanostructuring-Replacement method to construct metal nanoclusters that cannot be obtained directly via the "Jump-to-contact" mechanism. The method is demonstrated to construct Pt nanoclusters that are of great interest in catalysis and electrocatalysis but cannot be constructed via the "Jump-to-contact" mechanism. Since Cu is the most intensively studied and successful system in the tip-induced nanostructuring,it is utilized as the system in {{the first step of}} nanostructuring on Au(111) surface. The as-prepared Cu nanoclusters are replaced with Pt in the second step to form Pt nanoclusters. To fulfill the STM tip induced nanostructuring,an external workstation equipped with AD/DA board is employed for controlled generation of voltage signals,which are superimposed on the signals from a commercial STM instruments to direct the tip movement at desire. Cu nanostructuring is carried out in a CuSO_(4) solution with the substrate and tip potentials held at 10 mV and- 30 mV vs. Cu/Cu~(2 +),respectively,and STM feedback gain of 0. 3 and <b>setpoint</b> <b>current</b> of 2 nA. A voltage pulse,typically 0. 2 V and 10 ms depending on the z-sensitivity of the piezo,is applied on the z direction of the piezo to generate a Cu nanocluster. By repeating the procedure at desired positions,Cu nanocluster arrays or patterns can be constructed. In the second step,the CuSO_(4) solution is replaced with that of 0. 1 mol/L HClO_(4) + 5 mmol/L K_(2) PtCl_(6) for replacement of Cu clusters with the Pt. Since the reduction of each Pt(IV) ion consumes two Cu atoms,the Pt nanoclusters thus obtained are lower than the original Cu nanoclusters. Besides,the Cu UPD monolayer-covered Au(111) surface becomes atomically rough as only 50 % of the Au(111) surface is covered by Pt clusters after replacement. XPS data showed that Cu has almost been completely replaced with Pt. 作者联系地址：厦门大学化学化工学院固体表面物理化学国家重点实验室,厦门大学化学化工学院固体表面物理化学国家重点实验室,厦门大学化学化工学院固体表面物理化学国家重点实验室,厦门大学化学化工学院固体表面物理化学国家重点实验室 福建厦门 361005,福建厦门 361005,福建厦门 361005,福建厦门 361005 Author's Address: *Chemistry Department and State Key Laboratory for Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces,College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering,Xiamen University,Xiamen 361005,Fujian,Chin...|$|R
40|$|Graphene has {{the ability}} to provide for a {{technological}} revolution. First isolated and characterized in 2004, this material shows promise in the field of flexible electronics. The electronic properties of graphene can be tuned by controlling the shape of the membrane. Of particular interest in this endeavor are the thermal ripples in graphene membranes. Years of theoretical work by such luminaries as Lev Landau, Rudolf Peierls, David Mermin and Herbert Wagner have established that 2 D crystals should not be thermodynamically stable. Experimental research on thin films has supported this finding. Yet graphene exists, and freestanding graphene films have been grown on large scales. It turns out that coupling between the bending and stretching phonons can stabilize the graphene in a flat, albeit rippled phase. These ripples have attracted much attention, and recent work has shown how to arrange these ripples in a variety of configurations. In this thesis, I will present work done using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to interact with freestanding graphene membranes. First I will present STM images of freestanding graphene and show how these images show signs of distortion under the electrostatic influence of the STM tip. This electrostatic attraction between the STM tip and the graphene sample can be used to pull on the graphene sample. At the same time, by employing Joule heating in order to heat graphene using the tunneling current, and exploiting the negative coefficient of thermal expansion, a repulsive thermal load can be generated. By repeatedly pulling on the graphene using the electrostatic potential, while sequentially increasing the <b>setpoint</b> <b>current</b> we can generate a thermal mirror buckling event. Slowly heating the graphene using the tunneling current, prepares a small convex region of graphene under the tip. By increasing thermal stress, as well as pulling using the out of plane electrostatic force, the graphene suddenly and irreversibly switches the sign of its curvature. This event is discovered using STM measurements and supplemented by molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, I will show how to characterize this transition using the famed Ising model. The ripples are modeled as individual Ising spins, which at low temperature exhibit antiferromagnetic coupling. By heating the graphene membrane, the strain increases, changing the antiferromagnetic coupling to ferromagnetic coupling, which characterizes the irreversible transition from a soft, flexible state to a rigid configuration...|$|R
