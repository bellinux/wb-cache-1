As part of a peace treaty signed by the two kings at York on 15 June 1220, Henry committed himself to give Joan in marriage to Alexander “if we are able to recover her”, and if not he promised Alexander his second sister Isabelle. He promised furthermore to find husbands from the English nobility for Alexanders own sisters Margaret and Isabelle, all matches to be effected within a tightly defined time scale.

40|$|The {{complexity}} {{of the study of}} tropospheric ozone {{lies in the fact that}} it is a secondary pollutant.

The European legislation <b>compells</b> to make measurements of the tropospheric ozone due to its effects on people (fatigue, irritation of the mucous membranes, aggravation of asthma [...] .) and on environment (decrease of the production of cereals, synergy with plagues [...] .). The measuring net in Catalonia belongs to the Department of Environment and Housing (DMAH). It has a pyramidal structure and it allows a surveillance to notify in case of exceeding a certain threshold. From the registered data of last years it is shown that the number of incidences is related to meteorology. They are more frequent during afternoon and the behaviour of this pollutant is different according to the proximity of the point of measurement to the sources of its precursors...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThere is a thirteenth {{retainer}} in {{the band}} of thanes who eventually fail Beowulf in his last fight, and his enigmatic presence has often been noted {{as part of a}} possible allegorical reading of the episode as strongly allusive to Gethsemane and the betrayal of Christ. Yet {{it seems to me that}} this discreet and, as it were, intersticial character is functionally perhaps more rewarding to study than it may seem at first. His theft of a cup, which he unfortunately reinvests into the symbolic system of indebtedness, ultimately <b>compells</b> a particular reading of Beowulf's hamartia, and hence of his ultimate tragedy. The fault, or the tragic flaw, may therefore be pointed out to reside not so much exclusively in the character of the hero as an individual man, but rather in a more communal and societal dimension. I would like to approach the poem from that particular angle, which does not at all imply a cultural study of the context, but simply a particular analysis of the text itself. For my suggestion happens to be corroborated, I think, by a cursive survey of those elements of the poem which have sometimes been called digressive, and which are really those textual hinges, when the scop swerves off from a diegetic telling of his story (as for instance to mention the thirteenth retainer). Thematic and structural links may be brought to light by a diachronic reading, which make for what I consider like a performative depth and momentum of the poem...|$|R

Using image morphing methods, it is now possible to add 2 D motion to photographs by moving and blending image pixels in creative ways. We have taken this concept a step further by adding the ability to convey three-dimensional motions, such as scene rotations and viewpoint changes, by manipulating one or more photographs of a scene. The effect transforms a photograph or painting into an interactive visualization of the underlying object or scene in which the world may be rotated in 3 D. Several potential applications of this technology are discussed, in areas such as virtual reality, image databases, and special effects. 1 Introduction We think of a photograph as a 2 D snapshot of a person or a scene frozen in space and time.

40|$|This study explores what {{sexuality}} {{means for}} individual adolescents, by examining how an why adolescents go about engaging with multiple {{social and cultural}} prescriptions or ideals relation to their sexual lives. Grounded in the refined conceptualization of agency, the study approaches adolescents as “agents” in themselves and their sexual or reproductive practices “social actions”. Based on ethnographic methods, the study focuses on sexual and reproductive experiences of adolescents in Mtwara Town, Southern Tanzania. Central to th analysis is the understanding of sexual and reproductive actions from the adolescents’ viewpoints. Findings show that sexual practices during adolescence in Mtwara Town constitute contested social phenomena as they are simultaneously disapproved and endorsed by different social actors and institutions. In their quest for social well-being, adolescents inter-subjectively engage with multiple, competing and often contradictory sexual norms an expectations along with their own aspirations. Fundamentally, sanctions and rewards attach to adolescents’ sexual practices articulate different forms of social reputation. Accordingly, sexual respectability is among the key concerns in adolescents’ sexual practices. Situational shifting between and/or simultaneously combining two or more sexual formations are common {{in most of the}} adolescents’ lived experiences. Moreover, adolescent sexual activiti are enacted for different purposes rather than simply performed as mere behaviours <b>compell</b> by some physical or mental urge, or habits. The expectations that adolescents project into sexual partnership(s) constitute horizons or resolutions of hopes and fears (or “risk” dimensions) which are often in contrast with the dominant sexual and reproductive health ri discourses. Equally important, social spaces for adolescents’ sexual practices are enmeshed, or interwoven, in socially and culturally pre-established practices. In spite of the dominant tendencies in policy and scholarly discourses to represent adolescents’ sexual practices in universal, essentialist and normative terms, sexuality means different things for different young people coming of age in the rapidly changing urban settings of Southern Tanzania. A nuanced understanding of adolescent sexual practices from the actors’ standpoints is a pre- requisite for adequate intervention programmes. ...|$|E
40|$|Inhomogeneous {{universe}} {{models have}} been proposed as an alternative explanation for the apparent acceleration of the cosmic expansion that does not require dark energy. In the simplest class of inhomogeneous models, we live within a large, spherically symmetric void. Several {{studies have shown that}} such a model can be made consistent with many observations, in particular the redshift [...] luminosity distance relation for type Ia supernovae, provided that the void is of Gpc size and that we live close to the center. Such a scenario challenges the Copernican principle that we do not occupy a special place in the universe. We use the first-year Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II supernova search data set as well as the Constitution supernova data set to put constraints on the observer position in void models, using the fact that off-center observers will observe an anisotropic universe. We first show that a spherically symmetric void can give good fits to the supernova data for an on-center observer, but that the two data sets prefer very different voids. We then continue to show that the observer can be displaced at least fifteen percent of the void scale radius from the center and still give an acceptable fit to the supernova data. When combined with the observed dipole anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background however, we find that the data <b>compells</b> the observer to be located within about one percent of the void scale radius. Based on these results, we conclude that considerable fine-tuning of our position within the void is needed to fit the supernova data, strongly disfavouring the model from a Copernican principle point of view.
