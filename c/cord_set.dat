50|$|In North American practice, {{equipment}} {{connected by}} a <b>cord</b> <b>set</b> must have three wires, if supplied exclusively by 240 volts, or must have four wires (including neutral and ground), if supplied by 120/240 volts.|$|E
50|$|A <b>cord</b> <b>set</b> {{includes}} connectors molded to {{the cord}} {{at each end}} (see Appliance coupler). Cord sets are detachable from both the power supply and the electrical equipment, and consist of a flexible cord with electrical connectors at either end, one male, and one female. One end of the <b>cord</b> <b>set</b> {{is attached to a}} molded electrical plug; the other is typically a molded electrical receptacle to prevent the possibility of having an exposed live prong or pin which would cause electric shock. The female connector attaches to the piece of equipment or appliance while the male plug connects to the electrical receptacle or outlet.|$|E

In {{the case of}} detachable leads, the appliance end of the power cord has a female connector to link it to the appliance, to avoid the dangers from having a live protruding pin. Cords may also have twist-locking features, or other attachments to prevent accidental disconnection at one or both ends. A <b>cord</b> <b>set</b> may include accessories such as fuses for overcurrent protection, a pilot lamp to indicate voltage is present, or a leakage current detector. Power cords for sensitive instruments, or audio/video equipment may also include a shield over the power conductors to minimize electromagnetic interference.|$|E

Philips-branded sets and most store brands use an offset, with the longer anode (positive lead) being lower and the shorter cathode (negative lead) being higher on the wedge base. GE-branded sets (no longer actually made by GE) use a larger round base with a tab that sticks out to one side. A small resistor may also be contained {{in the base of}} older two-volt LED colors (red, orange, yellow) when in a mixed-color set, so that they match the three volts needed by the newer colors (blue, deep green, purple, white), however other manufacturers only change the value of the resistor that {{is a part of the}} <b>cord</b> <b>set</b> itself.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeThe {{morphological}} and biomechanical {{features of}} the thoracic spine, together with its {{close proximity to the}} spinal <b>cord,</b> <b>set</b> it apart from other spinal segments. Management of thoracic spine injuries consists of achieving a reduction and an immediate and long-lasting stabilization of the spine while constantly protecting the central and peripheral nervous system. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the best treatment for surgical thoracic spine fractures. Materials and methodsWe studied the baseline characteristics of 68 patients admitted to our neurosurgical department for one or several thoracic spine fractures between 2008 and 2010. We analysed on this group of patient the surgical management, complications and functional outcomes. We detailed the 2 -years radiological outcome on 50 patients (23 months mean follow-up). ResultsThe majority of patients underwent an extensive posterior arthrodesis bridging, on average, 5. 3 vertebrae. The median time between diagnosis and surgery was 2 days and the median length of stay in hospital was 13. 5 days. About 94 % of hooks and 80 % of pedicle screws were considered stable. Mean values of reduction and correction loss were similar (about 4. 5 °). We concluded to the superiority of extensive procedures and of pedicle screws fixation for the reduction and the maintenance of the correction by the end of follow-up. Functional data indicated daily discomfort and moderate pain. ConclusionA prospective study comparing the different procedures and instrumentations is needed to better define guidelines for the management of thoracic spine injuries.

40|$|This is {{the first}} {{documented}} history of the birth and evolution of the workers' councils system in Yugoslavia and the political conflicts that accompanied it. Straddling fourteen years, from the split with Moscow in 1948 to the re-opening of the national question {{for the first time}} after the Second World War in 1962, this thesis demonstrates that the progressive opening to the world market after the nto-Stalin conflict intensified domestic struggles and centrifugal pulls on the federation. Using the archival materials of the ruling Communist Party, government and mass organisations, it explains the stages by which the market came to dominate the party-state's mobilising strategies for society and the shop-floor. In Chapter 1, the introduction of workers' councils is shown to have been a measure to reverse the extraordinary and democratising mobilisation that followed the break with the USSR, by splitting more advanced sections of the working class from those more tied to the countryside. Chapter 2 suggests that the umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>set</b> up from the West to 'keep Tito afloat' allowed the Yugoslav Communists to continue to invest in heavy industry over agriculture in order to escape underdevelopment. This created food shortages and massive resistance to managerial imperatives on the shop-floor. As the country fell deeper in debt, the government intensified market reform under the guise of expanding selfmanagement in order to create an export sector. Chapter 3 sets the stage for open factional conflict in the leadership by noting the gulf between promise and reality in the workplace and on the terrain of complex and uneven domestic development. The main contribution of the thesis is to go beyond history as elite conflict and present it also as a process of class struggle with many mediating instances between the workplace and the state beholden to the world market.

40|$|The {{applicability}} of damage accumulation rules {{and of a}} constitutive equation derived by Cords to {{the description of the}} creep behaviour of X 10 NiCrAlTi 32 20 (Alloy 800 H) in creep tests with stress or temperture changes has been investigated. The tests were carried out at 800 °C and 900 °C and {{in order to ensure that}} the creep damage in the tests was the same as that obtained during actual service, creep tests for durations of up to 10 000 h were carried out. Metallographic examination of tested specimens showed that typical creep damage was occurring under the selected test conditions. It was shown that thermally aged specimens exhibited with increasing ageing time a decrease in time to rupture. Therefore the use of the linear damage accumulation rules for predicting rupture time is only possible if large margins of safety are introduced or if the structural changes due to thermal ageing effects during the creep test are included. Investigations into the {{applicability of}} the non-linear damage accumulation model developed by Kachanov were carried out, using different methods for the determination of the necessary materials parameters. By the introduction of a logarithmic time scale for the fitting of all the measured strain/time data at a given temperature, the best prediction of rupture life was obtained. Evaluation of the test results using the <b>Cords</b> <b>set</b> of equations showed that the equations needed to be extended to include an additional damage term at the low stresses of the experiments...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTemplate-based {{analysis}} of multi-parametric MRI {{data of the}} spinal <b>cord</b> <b>sets</b> the foundation for standardization and reproducibility, thereby helping the discovery of new biomarkers of spinal-related diseases. While MRI templates of the spinal cord have been recently introduced, none of them cover the entire spinal cord. In this study, we introduced an unbiased multimodal MRI template of the spinal cord and the brainstem, called PAM 50, which is anatomically compatible with the ICBM 152 brain template and uses the same coordinate system. The PAM 50 template is based on 50 healthy subjects, covers the full spinal cord (C 1 to L 2 vertebral levels) and the brainstem, is available for T 1 -, T 2 -and T 2 *-weighted MRI contrasts and includes a probabilistic atlas of the gray matter and white matter tracts. Template creation accuracy was assessed by computing the mean and maximum distance error between each individual spinal cord centerline and the PAM 50 centerline, after registration to the template. Results showed high accuracy for both T 1 - (mean =  0. 37  ±  0. 06  mm; max =  1. 39  ±  0. 58  mm) and T 2 -weighted (mean =  0. 11  ±  0. 03  mm; max =  0. 71  ±  0. 27  mm) contrasts. Additionally, {{the preservation of the}} spinal cord topology during the template creation process was verified by comparing the cross-sectional area (CSA) profile, averaged over all subjects, and the CSA profile of the PAM 50 template. The fusion of the PAM 50 and ICBM 152 templates will facilitate group and multi-center studies of combined brain and spinal cord MRI, and enable the use of existing atlases of the brainstem compatible with the ICBM space...|$|R
