25|$|The {{shoulder}} {{consists of}} a ball-and-socket joint formed by the humerus and scapula and their surrounding structures - ligaments, muscles, tendons - which support the bones and maintain the relationship of one to another. These supporting structures attach to the clavicle, humerus, and scapula, the latter providing the glenoid cavity, acromion and <b>coracoid</b> <b>processes.</b> The main joint of the shoulder is the shoulder joint (or glenohumeral joint), between the humerus and the glenoid process of the scapular. The acromioclavicular joint and sternoclavicular joint {{also play a role}} in shoulder movements. White hyaline cartilage on the ends of the bones (called articular cartilage) allows the bones to glide and move on each other, and the joint space is surrounded by a synovial membrane. Around the joint space are muscles - the rotator cuff, which directly surrounds and attaches to the shoulder joint - and other muscles that help provide stability and facilitate movement.|$|R
40|$|Full {{field of}} view coronal chest {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) routinely displays bilateral images of the brachial plexus, surface anatomy, and anatomic structures. Eighty patients had chest radiographs correlated with surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome. The PA chest film findings correlated with the surgical findings: smaller thoracic inlet on the concave side of the cervicothoracic spine scoliosis, shorter distance between the dorsal spine of {{the second or third}} thoracic vertebral body to the concavity of the first ribs, asymmetric clavicles and <b>coracoid</b> <b>processes,</b> synchondrosis of the first and second ribs, and muscle atrophy {{on the side of the}} clinical complaints. More than 235 patients were imaged. One hundred sixty-five of these were imaged with a 1. 5 -T unit and 3 -D reconstruction MRI. Coronal, transverse (axial), oblique transverse, and sagittal plane T 1 -weighted, selected T 2 -weighted, and fast spine echo pulse sequences were obtained, 4 - to 5 -mm slice thickness, 40 to 45 cm full {{field of view}}, 512 x 256 matrix and 2 NEX.

25|$|The biceps is {{a muscle}} {{in the upper}} arm with two heads, called the short head and the long head, which {{converge}} into a single mass. It {{is one of the}} three muscles in the anterior compartment of the arm, the others being the brachialis muscle and the coracobrachialis muscle, with which the biceps shares a nerve supply. Both heads of the biceps arise from the scapula in the shoulder, and the muscle attaches to the radius (bone), in the forearm. Specifically, the short head of the biceps originates from the <b>coracoid</b> <b>process</b> {{at the top of the}} scapula. The long head originates from the supraglenoid tubercle just above the shoulder joint. From here, the long head has a tendon that passes up along the intertubercular groove of the humerus into the joint capsule of the shoulder joint. The tendon of the short head runs adjacent to the tendon of the coracobrachialis and likewise attaches to the <b>coracoid</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
25|$|Between the 14th and 20th years, the {{remaining}} parts ossify in quick succession, and usually in this order; first, in {{the root of}} the <b>coracoid</b> <b>process,</b> {{in the form of a}} broad scale; secondly, near the base of the acromion; thirdly, in the inferior angle and contiguous part of the vertebral border; fourthly, near the outer end of the acromion; fifthly, in the vertebral border.|$|E
25|$|The {{base of the}} {{acromion}} {{is formed}} by an extension from the spine; the two nuclei of the acromion unite, and then join with the extension from the spine. The upper third of the glenoid cavity is ossified from a separate center (sub coracoid), which appears between the 10th and 11th years and joins between the 16th and the 18th years. Further, an epiphysial plate appears for {{the lower part of}} the glenoid cavity, and the tip of the <b>coracoid</b> <b>process</b> frequently has a separate nucleus. These various epiphyses are joined to the bone by the 25th year.|$|E
40|$|The {{brachial plexus}} in infraclavicular region can be blocked by various {{approaches}}. Aim {{of this study}} was to compare two approaches (coracoid and clavicular) regarding success rate, discomfort during performance of block, tourniquet tolerance and complications. The study was randomised, prospective and observer blinded. Sixty adult patients of both sexes of ASA status 1 and 2 requiring orthopaedic surgery below mid-humerus were randomly assigned to receive nerve stimulator guided infraclavicular brachial plexus block either by lateral coracoid approach (group L, n = 30) or medial clavicular approach (group M, n = 30) with 25 - 30 ml of 0. 5 % bupivacaine. Sensory block in the distribution of five main nerves distal to elbow, motor block (Grade 1 - 4), discomfort during performance of block and tourniquet pain were recorded by a blinded observer. Clinical success of block was defined as the block sufficient to perform the surgery without any supplementation. All the five nerves distal to elbow were blocked in 77 and 67 % patients in groups L and M respectively. Successful block was observed in 87 and 73 % patients in groups L and M, respectively (P > 0. 05). More patients had moderate to severe discomfort during performance of block due to positioning of limb in group M (14 vs. 8 in groups M and L). Tourniquet was well tolerated in most patients with successful block in both groups. No serious complication was observed. Both the approaches were equivalent regarding success rate, tourniquet tolerance and safety. Coracoid approach seemed better as positioning of operative limb was less painful, <b>coracoids</b> <b>process</b> was easy to locate and the technique was easy to learn and master...|$|R

25|$|In {{the fossil}} therapsids, a third bone, the true coracoid, formed {{just behind the}} procoracoid. The {{resulting}} three-boned structure is still seen in modern monotremes, but in all other living mammals, the procoracoid has disappeared, and the coracoid bone has fused with the scapula, to become the <b>coracoid</b> <b>process.</b> These changes {{are associated with the}} upright gait of mammals, compared with the more sprawling limb arrangement of reptiles and amphibians; the muscles formerly attached to the procoracoid are no longer required. The altered musculature is also responsible for the alteration {{in the shape of the}} rest of the scapula; the forward margin of the original bone became the spine and acromion, from which the main shelf of the shoulder blade arises as a new structure.|$|E
25|$|The scapula is a wide, flat bone {{lying on}} the {{thoracic}} wall that provides an attachment for three different groups of muscles. The intrinsic muscles of the scapula include {{the muscles of the}} rotator cuff—the subscapularis, teres minor, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus. These muscles attach {{to the surface of the}} scapula and are responsible for the internal and external rotation of the shoulder joint, along with humeral abduction. The extrinsic muscles include the biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscles and attach to the <b>coracoid</b> <b>process</b> and supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, infraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, and spine of the scapula. These muscles are responsible for several actions of the glenohumeral joint. The third group, which is mainly responsible for stabilization and rotation of the scapula, consists of the trapezius, serratus anterior, levator scapulae, and rhomboid muscles and attach to the medial, superior, and inferior borders of the scapula.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{examination}} of the shoulder to feel for injury and discover the limits of movement, location of pain, and extent of joint instability. The steps to elicit this information are inspection (looking), palpation (feeling), testing range of motion, and performing special maneuvers. Information collected on inspection are asymmetry, atrophy, ecchymosis, scars, swelling, and venous distention. Palpation can help find pain and deformities, and should specifically include the anterior glenohumeral joint, acromioclavicular joint, biceps tendon, cervical spine, <b>coracoid</b> <b>process,</b> scapula, and sternoclavicular joint. Range of motion tests external and internal rotation, abduction and adduction, passive and active weakness, and true weakness versus weakness due to pain. The Apley scratch test is the most useful: touch opposite scapular by reaching behind the head for adduction and external rotation and behind the back for abduction and internal rotation. Finally, there are more specific maneuvers that can hone in on a diagnosis, however their accuracy is limited.|$|E
40|$|Objective Since the {{shoulders}} are rarely seriously injured in frontal or oblique collisions, {{they have been}} given low priority {{in the development of}} frontal impact crash test dummies. The shoulder complex geometry and its kinematics are of vital importance for the overall dummy kinematics. The shoulder complex also influences the risk of the safety belt slipping off the shoulder in oblique forward collisions. The first aim {{of this study was to}} develop a new 50 th percentile male THOR shoulder design while the second was to compare the new shoulder, mounted on a THOR NT dummy, with volunteer, THOR NT and Hybrid III range-of-motion and stiffness data. The third aim was to test the repeatability of the new shoulder during dynamic testing and to see how the design behaves with respect to belt slippage in a 45 ° far-side collision. Methods The new 50 th percentile THOR shoulder design was developed with the aid of a shell model of the seated University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) 50 th percentile male with coordinates for joints and bony landmarks (Schneider et al., 1983). The new shoulder design has human-like bony landmarks for the acromion and <b>coracoid</b> <b>processes.</b> The clavicle curvature and length are also made similar to that of a male human, as is the range-of-motion in the anterior-posterior, superior-inferior and medial-lateral directions. The new shoulder design was manufactured and tested under the same conditions that Törnvall et al. (2005 b) used to compare the shoulder range-of-motion for the volunteers, Hybrid III and THOR Alpha. The new design was also tested in two dynamic test configurations: the first was a 0 ° full-frontal test and the second was a 45 ° far-side test. The dummy tests were conducted with an R- 16 seat with a three-point belt, the ΔV was 27. 0 ± 0. 5 km/h and the maximum peak acceleration was approximately 14. 6 ± 0. 5 g for each test. Results A new shoulder design with geometry close to that of humans was developed to be retrofitted to the THOR NT dummy. The results showed that the range-of-motion for the new shoulder complex during static loading was larger by at least a factor of three, for the maximum load (200 N/arm), than that of either the Hybrid III or the THOR NT; this means it was more similar to the volunteers’ range-of-motion. It was observed that the THOR NT with the new shoulder did not slide out of the shoulder-belt during a far-side collision. The performance of the new shoulder was reasonably repeatable and stable during both the static tests and the sled tests. Conclusions A new shoulder for the THOR NT has been designed and developed, and data from static range-of-motion tests and sled tests indicate that the new shoulder complex has the potential to function in a more human-like manner on the THOR dummy...|$|R
40|$|There {{is limited}} {{information}} {{available on the}} morphology of the thoracic limb of the ringtailed lemur (Lemur catta). This study describes the morphology of the thoracic limb of captive ring-tailed lemurs evidenced by gross osteology and radiography {{as a guide for}} clinical use. Radiographic findings of 12 captive ring-tailed lemurs are correlated with bone specimens of three adult animals. The clavicle is well developed. The scapula has a large area for the origin of the m. teres major. The <b>coracoid</b> and hamate <b>processes</b> are well developed. The lateral supracondylar crest and medial epicondyle are prominent. The metacarpal bones are widely spread, and the radial tuberosity is prominent. These features indicate the presence of strong flexor muscles and flexibility of thoracic limb joints, which are important in arboreal quadrupedal locomotion. Furthermore, an ovoid ossicle is always seen at the interphalangeal joint of the first digit. Areas of increased soft tissue opacity are superimposed over the proximal half of the humerus and distal half of the antebrachium in male animals {{as a result of the}} scent gland.

2500|$|A bone {{fracture}} {{of the shoulder}} involves a partial or total crack {{through one of the}} three bones in the shoulder, the clavicle, the scapula, and the humerus.

Fractures usually involve the clavicle or the neck (area below the ball) of the humerus. Fractures of the scapula sometimes occur through the <b>coracoid</b> <b>process</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|The capsule is a {{soft tissue}} {{envelope}} that encircles the glenohumeral joint and {{attaches to the}} scapula, humerus, {{and head of the}} biceps. It is lined by a thin, smooth synovial membrane. [...] This capsule is strengthened by the coracohumeral ligament which attaches the <b>coracoid</b> <b>process</b> of the scapula to the greater tubercle of the humerus. [...] There are also three other ligaments attaching the lesser tubercle of the humerus to lateral scapula and are collectively called the glenohumeral ligaments.|$|E
2500|$|The scapula is ossified from 7 or more centers: {{one for the}} body, two for the <b>coracoid</b> <b>process,</b> two for the acromion, one for the {{vertebral}} border, and one for {{the inferior}} angle. Ossification of the body begins about the second month of fetal life, by an irregular quadrilateral plate of bone forming, immediately behind the glenoid cavity. This plate extends to form the chief part of the bone, the scapular spine growing up from its dorsal surface about the third month. Ossification starts as membranous ossification before birth. [...] After birth, the cartilaginous components would undergo endochondral ossification. The larger part of the scapula undergoes membranous ossification. [...] Some of the outer parts of the scapula are cartilaginous at birth, and would therefore undergo endochondral ossification.|$|E
2500|$|Endochondral {{ossification}} {{begins with}} {{points in the}} cartilage called [...] "primary ossification centers." [...] They mostly appear during fetal development, though a few short bones begin their primary ossification after birth. [...] They {{are responsible for the}} formation of the diaphyses of long bones, short bones and certain parts of irregular bones. [...] Secondary ossification occurs after birth, and forms the epiphyses of long bones and the extremities of irregular and flat bones. [...] The diaphysis and both epiphyses of a long bone are separated by a growing zone of cartilage (the epiphyseal plate). At skeletal maturity (18 to 25 years of age), all of the cartilage is replaced by bone, fusing the diaphysis and both epiphyses together (epiphyseal closure). In the upper limbs, only the diaphyses of the long bones and scapula are ossified. [...] The epiphyses, carpal bones, <b>coracoid</b> <b>process,</b> medial border of the scapula, and acromion are still cartilaginous.|$|E
2500|$|The {{proximal}} tendons of the biceps brachii {{are commonly}} involved in pathological processes {{and are a}} frequent cause of anterior shoulder pain. Disorders of the distal biceps brachii tendon typically result from partial and complete tears of the muscle. [...] Partial tears are usually characterized by enlargement and abnormal contour of the tendon. Complete tears generate a soft-tissue mass in the anterior aspect of the arm, the so-called Popeye sign, which paradoxically leads to a decreased strength during flexion and supination of the forearm. Tears of the biceps brachii occur in athletic activities and corrective surgery repairs biceps brachii tendon tears. [...] Proximal ruptures of the long head of the biceps tendon can be surgically repaired by two different techniques. Biceps tenodesis is resurfacing the tendon by screw fixation on the humerus and biceps tenotomy is trimming the long head of the biceps tendon promoting the muscle origination from the <b>coracoid</b> <b>process.</b> Preexisting degeneration in the tendon can cause partial tears called lesions and are rarely associated with a traumatic event. The most common symptom of a biceps tear is pain. It {{will be the most}} severe in the muscle, but may stretch to the shoulders and elbows as well. [...] Treatment of a biceps tear depends on the severity of the injury. [...] In most cases, the muscle will heal over time with no corrective surgery. Applying cold pressure and using anti-inflammatory medications will ease pain and reduce swelling. More severe injuries require surgery and post-op physical therapy to regain strength and functionality in the muscle. Corrective surgeries of this nature are typically reserved for elite athletes who rely on a complete recovery.|$|E
