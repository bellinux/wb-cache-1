50|$|The native enzyme {{was shown}} to {{be made up of}} two subunit {{monomers}} via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weights of these subunits was estimated to be 47,000 g/mol. The enzyme works as a homodimer, and is induced by choline chloride. Each monomer of <b>creatinase</b> has two clearly defined domains, a small N-terminal domain, and a large C-terminal domain. Each of the two active sites is made by residues of the large domain of one monomer and some residues of the small domain of the other monomer. It has been suggested that a sulfhydryl group is located on or near the active site of the enzyme following inhibition experiments. <b>Creatinase</b> {{has been found to be}} most active at pH 8 and is most stable between ph 6-8 for 24 hrs. at 37 degrees.|$|E

40|$|Amino acid {{sequence}} comparison {{suggests that}} the structure of Escherichia coli methionine aminopeptidase (EC 3. 4. 11. 18) and the C-terminal domain of Pseudomonas putida <b>creatinase</b> (EC 3. 5. 3. 3) are related. A detailed comparison of the three-dimensional folds of the two enzymes confirms this homology: with an approximately 260 -residue chain segment, 218 C alpha atoms of the structures superimpose within 2. 5 A; only 41 of these overlapping positions (i. e., 19 %) feature identical amino acids in the two protein chains. Notwithstanding this striking correspondence in structure, methionine aminopeptidase binds and is stimulated by Co 2 +, while <b>creatinase</b> is not a metal-dependent enzyme. Searches of protein data banks using sequence and structure-based profiles reveal other enzymes, including aminopeptidase P (EC 3. 4. 11. 9), prolidase (EC 3. 4. 13. 9), and agropine synthase, that likely share the same "pita-bread" fold common to <b>creatinase</b> and methionine aminopeptidase...|$|E
40|$|<b>Creatinase</b> (creatine amidinohydrolase, EC 3. 5. 3. 3) from Pseudomonas putida is a {{homodimer}} of 45 kDa subunit molecular mass, {{the three-dimensional}} structure {{of which is}} known at 1. 9 A resolution. Three point mutants, A 109 V, V 355 M, and V 182 I, {{as well as one}} double mutant combining A 109 V and V 355 M, and the triple mutant with all three replacements, were compared with wild-type <b>creatinase</b> regarding their physical and enzymological properties. High-resolution crystal data for wild-type <b>creatinase</b> and the first two mutants suggest isomorphism at least for these three proteins (R. Huber, pers. comm.). Physicochemical measurements confirm this prediction, showing that the mutations have no effect either on the quaternary structure and gross conformation or the catalytic properties as compared to wild-type <b>creatinase.</b> The replacement of V 182 (at the solvent-exposed end of the first helix of the C-terminal domain) does not cause significant differences in comparison with the wild-type enzyme. The other point mutations stabilize {{the first step in the}} biphasic denaturation transition without affecting the second one. In sum, the enhanced stability seems to reflect slight improvements in the local packing without creating new well-defined bonds. The increase in hydrophobicity generated by the introduction of additional methyl groups (A 109 V, V 182 I) must be compensated by minor readjustments of the global structure. Secondary or quaternary interactions are not affected. In going from single to double and triple mutants, to a first approximation, the increments of stabilization are additive...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{experiments}} was to investigate some key areas of nitrogen metabolism in adult and third-stage larval Ostertagia (Teladorsagia) circumcincta, to seek enzymes either not present in mammals or with distinctive kinetic properties, which clearly differentiated the nematode and host metabolic systems. The study encompassed excretion and uptake in intact worms and determining the kinetic properties of eleven enzymes involved in the metabolism of arginine, urea, alanine aspartate and glutamate. The metabolism of O. circumcincta was different from that in mammals and more like that of microorganisms and plants. Ammonia was the main excretory product, with a little urea, both apparently crossing the cuticle through specific permeases. The excretion rate increased with temperature, but decreased as the external ammonia concentration increased, suggesting that ammonia may {{be a source of}} nitrogen additional to amino acids, which were taken up by adult worms. Ammonia could be incorporated directly into glutamate and other amino acids through the glutamine synthetase-glutamate synthase pathway, which was more active in adult worms. Glutamate dehydrogenase was able to use either NADH or NADP in the deaminating direction, which would be the predominant direction because of the low affinity of GDH for ammonia. In the aminating direction, there was greater activity with NADH than NADPH. <b>Creatinase</b> and arginase were probably the sources of excreted urea. There was no urease activity to convert urea to ammonia. No role could be assigned to <b>creatinase</b> other than to degrade host creatine, perhaps to supply sarcosine for metabolism. The unusual feature of aspartate metabolism was aspartase activity in addition to aspartate aminotransferase, which, in larvae, had the highest activity of all enzymes studied. In adult worms, which are believed to have a more anaerobic metabolism than larvae, aspartase would allow aspartate to be formed directly from fumarate in association with only a partial TCA cycle. Perhaps the most important finding was the identification in the parasites of three enzymes, <b>creatinase,</b> aspartase and glutamate synthase, which are not believed to be expressed in the sheep host or other mammals, making them possible candidates for developing novel anthelmintic therapies...|$|E
40|$|To the Editor: Creatine, a major {{constituent}} of hu-man skeletal and cardiac muscle (1) {{has a low}} relative molecular mass (Mr 131). Thus the compound enters the plasma compartment very quickly af-ter cellular lesions occur (2) and is partly excreted in urine (3). Therefore, we tested {{the possibility of using}} cre-atine determinations in serum, saliva, and urine as an early marker for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarc-tion (AMI). For determining creatune, we used the enzymatic method of Suzuki and Yoshida (4). This method is not inter-fered with by cephalosporins and creat-mine (5), so it is advantageous for determinations of creatine in urine. The method also offers the possibility of automated analysis. <b>Creatinase,</b> sar-cosine oxidase, peroxidase,and 4. ami [...] nopyrine were purchased from Boeh-ringer, Mannheim, F. R. G.

40|$|The {{structure}} of the proline-specific aminopeptidase (EC 3. 4. 11. 9) from Escherichia coli has been solved and refined for crystals of the native enzyme at a 2. 0 -Å resolution, for a dipeptide-inhibited complex at 2. 3 -Å resolution, and for a low-pH inactive form at 2. 7 -Å resolution. The protein crystallizes as a tetramer, more correctly a dimer of dimers, at both high and low pH, consistent with observations from analytical ultracentrifuge studies that show that the protein is a tetramer under physiological conditions. The monomer folds into two domains. The active site, in the larger C-terminal domain, contains a dinuclear manganese center in which a bridging water molecule or hydroxide ion appears poised to act as the nucleophile in {{the attack on the}} scissile peptide bond of Xaa-Pro. The metal-binding residues are located in a single subunit, but the residues surrounding the active site are contributed by three subunits. The fold of the protein resembles that of creatine amidinohydrolase (<b>creatinase,</b> not a metalloenzyme). The C-terminal catalytic domain is also similar to the single-domain enzyme methionine aminopeptidase that has a dinuclear cobalt center...|$|E
40|$|It {{had been}} shown that the cloned dddP gene of the marine {{bacterium}} Roseovarius nubinhibens allows Escherichia coli to form the volatile dimethyl sulfide (DMS) from dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), an abundant anti-stress compatible solute made by many marine plankton and macroalgae. Using purified DddP, we show here that this enzyme is a DMSP lyase that cleaves DMSP to DMS plus acrylate. DddP forms a functional homodimeric enzyme, has a pH optimum of 6. 0 and a Km of ~ 14 mM for the DMSP substrate. DddP belongs to the M 24 B family of peptidases, some members of which have metal cofactors. However, the metal chelators EDTA and bipyridyl did not affect DddP activity in vitro and the as-isolated enzyme did not contain metal ions. Thus, DddP resembles those members of the M 24 B family, such as <b>creatinase,</b> which also act on a non-peptide substrate and have no metal cofactor. Site-directed mutagenesis of the active site region of DddP completely abolished its activity. Another enzyme, termed DddL, which occurs in other {alpha}-proteobacteria, had {{also been shown to}} generate DMS plus acrylate from DMSP. However, DddL and DddP have no sequence similarity to each other, so DddP represents a second, wholly different class of DMSP lyase...|$|E
40|$|Microbial enzymes {{were studied}} from two {{medicinal}} viewpoints. First, we examined proline-specific peptidases from pathogenic microorganisms. We found several proline-specific peptidases in pathogenic bacteria. Among them, prolyl tripeptidyl aminopeptidase from Porphylomonas gingivals and prolyl aminopeptidase from Serratia marcescens were crystallized. The complex structures of those enzymes and inhibitors were clarified in X-ray crystallography. Aminopeptidase N, which has wide specificity for amino acids, was {{distributed in the}} pathogens. The crystal structure of the aminopeptidase N elucidated the reasons for its wide substrate specificity but inertness to the X-Pro bond. It was also revealed that proline-specific peptidases and aminopeptidase N cooperatively degrade collagen for the uptake of amino acids as nutrition when these bacteria infect cells. Second, we applied enzymes from microorganisms to diagnostic analyses. We found a series of creatinine-metabolizing enzymes in Pseudomonas putida. Creatininase, <b>creatinase,</b> and sarcosine oxidase were coupled and {{have been developed for}} a diagnostic analysis kit that examines renal function. The structures of the native and the Mn 2 +-activated creatininases were determined in X-ray crystallography. Based on the structure, the activated enzyme was used for an improved assay kit.

The control group contain of 72 healthy subjects (31 men and 41 women), with the average age of 58. 5 year. The concentration of cathepsin B and procathepsin B in the urine were corrected to creatinine, which was determined by the enzymatic <b>creatinase</b> method. The concentrations of cathepsin B in urine were singnificantly elevated in patients than in control group (median = 3. 5 µg/l vs. 0. 9 µg/l, P = 0. 01), similarly the results of the cathepsin B/creatinine ratio were elevated (median = 0. 4 µg/mmol vs. 0. 1 µg/mmol, P = 0. 01).

40|$|The Gaussian {{network model}} (GNM) {{can be used}} as a first {{approximation}} for describing the fluctuation dynamics of proteins, the limits of applicability and the range of validity of the model parameters need to be established. A systematic analysis of the GNM predictions is done within the scope of this thesis, and the potential utility of GNM for elucidating structure-dynamics-function relations in enzymes is explored. The application of the GNM to a set of 183 non-homologous proteins shows that it can predict the X-ray crystallographic temperature factors more precisely than full-atomic normal mode analysis (NMA) does. Furthermore, the application to 1250 non-redundant proteins indicates that the GNM predictions agree better with NMR solution data, than X-ray crystallographic, and measurements taken at high diffraction temperatures. A systematic study of 98 enzymes that belong to different enzyme classes (EC) shows that catalytic residues are distinguished by their restricted mobilities in the global modes. The amplitudes of their fluctuations rank in the lowest 7 % range amongst the rank-ordered mobilities of all residues. Catalytic residues also bear more restricted mobilities than their 4 flanked neighbors in sequence and this feature holds for more than 70 % of the examined catalytic residues, suggesting a communication between chemical activity and molecular mechanics. The observed restricted mobility of catalytic residues is used as a criterion for identifying active sites of enzymes in a newly developed algorithm (COMPACT). The method shows a high sensitivity and a moderate-to-low specificity for a set of representative monomeric enzymes. All the false-positives predicted by COMPACT are found to be highly conserved, suggesting that their finely tuned dynamics results from evolutionary pressure. These particular sites are proposed to serve as alternative drug binding targets. We have implemented this tool in iGNM, a database of protein dynamics. Protein dynamics stored in iGNM or computed from the online calculation server (oGNM) have assisted in identifying possible silver ion binding residue in <b>creatinase</b> and describing the loop mobilities of low-fidelity DNA polymerase.

40|$|Amperometric enzyme {{electrodes}} {{have been}} developed for the detection of glucose, sarcosine and creatinine, and tested at "in-house" fabricated graphite rod electrodes. Determination of these analytes was primarily performed in the presence of ferrocenemonocarboxylic acid (FMCA) but also by the oxidation of enzymatically generated hydrogen peroxide (H 202) for comparison. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and amperometric responses were used to analyse the enzyme electrode performances. Colloidal silver/gold-(Ag/Au) -nanoparticles (NPs) and Ag/Au-NPs composite films developed in this study were characterized by ultraviolet-visible (UV -Vis) and Fourier transform infrared (FfIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. In order to determine creatinine, the amperometric enzyme electrode was prepared by immobilizing creatininase (CA), <b>creatinase</b> (Cl) and sarcosine oxidase (SOD) in the optimized ratio of 2 : 3 : 5 units (U) respectively, onto the surface of graphite working electrodes (WEs) by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde (GA) in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA). The linear working range of the electrode was up to - 1100 f,lM with a sensitivity of 4. 6509 E- 08 Amps. cm- 2. f,lM- 1, the response time was 29 s (t 95 % at 100 [...] -+ 200 f,lM creatinine change) and the detection limit was 190 f,lM (SIN = 3). Glucose oxidase (GOD) was also immobilized onto the surface of the graphite WE by cross-linking with GA in the presence of BSA to measure glucose. The ratio amounts between, GOD, BSA and GA was also optimized. The linear working range of the electrode was 1 - 8. 5 mM with a sensitivity of 3. 9518 E- 05 Amps. cm- 2. mM- 1, the response time was 6 s (t 95 % at 0. 5 [...] -+ ImM glucose change) and the detection limit was 0. 45 mM (SIN = 3). Ag-NPs in the enzyme layer had a negative effect on response however; the presence of Au-NPs improved the sensitivity by almost 20 %. Secondly, GOD was immobilized into partially prehydrolysed silica sol-gel (pphTEOS) and polyvinyl alcohol (PV A) composite film {{on the surface of the}} graphite electrodes. For comparison, Ag- and Au-NPs were incorporated into the immobilization process by preliminary preparing Ag/Au-NPs using PVA as a reducing agent. The linear working range of the electrode was 1. 5 - 6 mM with a sensitivity of 4. 322 1 E- 05 Amps. cm- 2 mM-I h.,t e response time was 5 s (t 95 % at 0. 5 [...] -+ ImM glucose change) and the detection limit was 0. 35 mM (SIN = 3). PVA loaded with Au-NPs was capable of extending the linear range by a further 3 mM. 11 This immobilization method was also employed for SOD to determine its activity towards sarcosine. The linear working range of the electrode was 1. S-SrnM with a sensitivity of 4. 3221 E-OSAmps. cm- 2. rnM- 1, the response time was 17 s (t 95 % at O.

40|$|Whenthe {{bacteria}} were, however, {{transferred from}} the glycocyamine medium to an agar glycine medium, which contained as C and N source only glycine, and harvested on this, glycocyamase activity of the bacteria disappeared, but creatinomutase and glycocyamidinase existed as before. The action of glycocyamidinase was certified beside by Jaffe reaction also by measuring the increased extinction of the solution colored with the Sakaguchi 2 ̆ 7 s reagents. On the other hand, when the bacteria were transferredand grown on an agar creatine medium, an adaptive enzyme system which decomposes creatine and creatinine into urea and sarcosine was produced, {{as in the case}} of the bacteria previously investigated here in respect to creatinomutase. Glycocyamase was, however, absent. Heating of this bacterial suspension at 55 ℃ for 30 minutes abolished the enzyme action to produce urea from creatine and creatinine, whereas the creatinomutase and glycocyamidinase actions were ascertained to have remained. From above mentioned data it is clear, so far as the strain of soil bacteria isolated this time is concerned, that the glycocyamase is an adaptive enzyme, but creatinomutase and glycocyamidinase belong to the constitutive enzyme. It was observed previously at the investigation on the bacterial decomposition of creatine and creatinine that in a strain of soil bacteria grown on the creatine or creatinine agar medium an adaptive enzyme system was formed. Among the enzymes there were the <b>creatinase</b> which produces urea from creatine but not from glycocyamine and the creatinomutase, which accelerates reversible interchange of creatine and creatinine. It was remarkable, thereby, that by the same bacterial preparation glycocyamidine could be hydrolyzed to glycocyamine. From this fact a provisional assumption was made that through relative adaptation of the bacteria the glycocyamidinase might be formed hand in hand with the creatinomutase owing to the resemblance of chemical constitution of both substrates. However, the experiment described in the present paper shows that the creatinomutase and glycocyamidinase can be present together a priori as constitutive enzymes. Therefore, the relative adaptation theory should be reserved as not established for a time until some further studies will determine whether or not the two enzyme actions would be found dissociated in some other bacteria. A strain of Gram-positive coccus was isolated from soil which could grow on agar medium containing glycocyamine as single C and N source. The bacteria obtained, when cultivated on this medium, the ability to hydrolyze glycocyamine into glycine and urea. Urease was also present. Activity of the enzyme, glycocyamase, was determined by photometric estimation of the decreasing amount of the Sakaguchi-reaction positive substrate. Optimum pH was 7. 0. Experimental temperature was 37 ℃ and test solutions, in which the final concentration of glycocyamine or other substrates was M/ 1000, were overlayed with toluene. Glycocyamase is thermostable and its action remained intact after heating the bacterial suspension at 55 ℃ for 30 minutes. The suspension of the bacteria thus adapted was not able to hydrolyse arginine, and α-guanido propionic acid, but arginic acid and β-guanido propionic acid though to a small extent, whereas the extract by M/ 10 Na_ 2 HPO_ 4 (pH 9. 0) of the acetone-dried bacteria hydrolyzed only glycocyamine and was inactive upon the other guanido compounds. The action of glycocyamase is therefore very specific. Moreover, the suspension did not produce any urea or ammonia from creatine and creatinine. However, it was observed that the Jaffe reaction of the test solution incubated with creatine became intensified and that with creatinine was on the contrary lessened. This indicates that the bacteria contain the creatinomutase which catalyses the mutual conversion of creatine and creatinine. Another enzyme, glycocyamidinase, which splits glycocyamidine to glycocyamine, and was previously investigated in this department, was also present, since the bacterial suspension lessened the Jaffe reaction of the test solution incubated with glycocyamidine. Therefore, the bacteria grown on glycocyamine medium contained glycocyaxnase, creatinomutase and glycocyamidinase...|$|E
