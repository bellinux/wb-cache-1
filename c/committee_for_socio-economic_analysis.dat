The present study investigates how gender, age, and cultural background account for differences in reference frame proclivity and performance in a virtual navigation task. Using an online navigation study, we recorded reaction times, error rates (confusion of turning axis), and reference frame proclivity (egocentric vs. allocentric reference frame) of 1823 participants. Reaction times significantly varied with gender and age, but were only marginally influenced by the cultural background of participants. Error rates were in line with these results and exhibited a significant influence of gender and culture, but not age. Participants??? cultural background significantly influenced reference frame selection; the majority of North-Americans preferred an allocentric strategy, while Latin-Americans preferred an egocentric navigation strategy.

40|$|The Northwest Atlantic Marine Ecoregional Assessment, {{designed}} by The Nature Conservancy, is a marine spatial planning process which strives for an integrated management approach to marine conservation design. As ecosystem based management gains momentum, non-governmental organizations {{and federal agencies}} have realized the need to consider <b>socio-economic</b> objectives <b>for</b> and impacts of management plans and conservation strategies on coastal and marine-related communities. 	This report reviews the application of three methods for the integration of socio-economics in marine conservation planning: market and non-market economic valuation and social impact assessment.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the requirements for, and illustrates the application of, a methodology <b>for</b> a <b>socio-economic</b> <b>analysis</b> (SEA) {{especially as it}} might be adopted in the framework of REACH. <b>Socio-economic</b> <b>analysis</b> weighs the costs of any restrictions on the production and use of chemicals against the benefits to human health and the environment. The reasons why industry needs to understand the principles and practices of socioeconomic analysis are: (l) to carry out, where appropriate, a SEA as an argument for authorisation (this is an industry responsibility), and (2) to be able to contribute as stakeholders in socio-economic discussions with regulatory authorities when a SEA is used as a basis for justifying restrictions. The focus of this report is on the ecological impacts of chemicals rather than on their human health impacts. This is where many of the most profound ecological and economic challenges are, and the ECHA guidance <b>for</b> <b>socio-economic</b> <b>analysis</b> associated with both restrictions and authorisation in the REACH process identifies the need for more work in this area. The report argues for as much quantification as possible, with the ideal of monetisation so that a cost-benefit analysis can be carried out. Without quantification the ecological benefits of restrictions on chemicals (including failure to authorise) may well be presented in emotive terms that are hard to counter {{on the basis of the}} economic benefits that might be lost from restricted use or the banning of a chemical. An ecological benefits assessment involves two components. One is the extent to which ecological etlects are or may be ameliorated by restrictions on a chemical, and the other is the monetary value that is put on the ecosystems so protected. There are enormous challenges in ascribing monetary values, especially to non-marketed ecological goods or services. However, environmental economics has made great strides over recent years in developing appropriate methodologies to enable this to be achieved. This report draws attention to the appropriate sources. A substantial part of the challenge for valuation in benefits assessments is in identifying and quantifying the ecological impacts themselves in appropriate terms. The problem is that ecological risk characterisations and assessments do not express effects in terms of 2 ̆ 7 impacts 2 ̆ 7 that can be valued. This report draws attention to a number of possible scenarios whereby the outputs of risk characterisations might be linked to quantified ecological impacts through such methods as species-sensitivity analysis, smart modelling, making connections to ecological quality status and using an ecosystem services approach. None of these methods is developed to the extent that they could be applied in case studies. There will be a need for pioneering efforts in these areas. The challenge of conducting a <b>socio-economic</b> <b>analysis</b> becomes even harder when only hazard criteria are available as is the case for substances of very high concern. The report takes the view that most of these chemicals will be degradable in the environment and in organisms, and therefore should be amenable to standard risk characterisations. However, the expectation is that the SEA arguments will have to be particularly convincing to allow authorisation. Finally, <b>socio-economic</b> <b>analysis</b> needs to bring together risk assessment and economic considerations. This requires that ecologists and economists, scientists and regulators understand each other 2 ̆ 7 s needs and languages. The establishment of a forum to facilitate this is to be encouraged...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{assumption}} {{of free will}} in contemporary economics is an important starting point <b>for</b> <b>socio-economic</b> <b>analysis</b> in contrast to methodologies which assume that human action is pre-determined by forces beyond individual control. However, contemporary economic theory is devoid of choice in critical domains with important implication for economic analyses and public policy, given the ancillary {{assumption of}} the importance of market forces in determining choice behavior. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to argue that freedom of choice exists given traditional constraints such as relative prices and income. Design/methodology/approach – This is a theoretical paper examining the assumption of free will in choice behaviour in economic theory. It makes reference to literature in economics and philosophy that shed light on this critical working assumption in economics. Findings – Conventional analysis pays little heed to non economic constraints on human action that affect and delimit but do not preclude free choice or free will. Of vital importance to free will in choice behavior are institutions which delimit the extent of coercion in the decision-making process. Practical implications – An important implication for research is the determination of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of free will in choice behaviour. Given the existence of free will and free choice, individuals are morally responsible for their choices. It is therefore important to determine the extent which free will exists and that which constrains free will in choice behaviour. Originality/value – This paper challenges the extremes of the free will debate in economics and suggests the boundaries within which free will exists in economic behaviour. It also suggests the welfare implications of limitations on free will where no negative externalities exist. Economic theory, Free will, Individual behaviour, Welfare...|$|R

However, the high cost of implementation does not allow to use large samples, and therefore it is difficult to carry out statistically significant comparison at the local level. The open access to databases which were created for different purposes (e. g., tax, administrative, monitoring) could overcome these limitations with many advantages. In this article we present a validation exercise based on data records provided by the Italian law whenever a change in an employment contract occurs, i. e. the so called compulsory communications (COB). This was possible because of an exceptional access to two different data sources, with the aim to assess the impact in terms of employment of vocational training policies in Regione Piemonte (northwest Italy), that is the COB database and a direct survey performed on students one year after the course. We describe the major differences between indicators calculated on survey data and indicators calculated on COBs. Discrepancies are observed for 20 % individuals in the sample analyzed. In addition, the change of source distorts the results of the net impact evaluation. In fact, both the determinants of the employment probability and the importance of the net impact do significantly vary across sources.

40|$|The {{primary concern}} of this {{research}} is the justice of using government resources for poverty reduction, in other words investigating whether or not such investment has served its claimed purpose. My central argument is that government organized resettlement projects have mobilized many resources and some have brought potential prosperity to the resettled farmers. However, they have not sufficiently benefited the government claimed target groups, namely the poorer populations of the places of origin. Many of the beneficiaries are not the poorer members of the population but come instead from the more affluent of those places. The central argument of my thesis is elaborated in three dimensions: socio-economic, the policy and the development sociological dimension. Socio-economic dimension is to illustrate the outcome of resettlement projects. The <b>socio-economic</b> <b>analysis</b> provides evidence about who has benefited and in what ways. The data used <b>for</b> the <b>socio-economic</b> <b>analysis</b> are drawn from both the questionnaire survey and participatory research. The argument concerning the policy dimension is that when modernization theory and the economic growth model dominate the rationale of policy formulation and implementation, a poverty reduction policy will not serve its aims. Sociological debates about development are explored to interpret the processes that have brought about the outcomes. My argument in regard to development sociology is that given the dynamics of resettlement, better-off farmers will take economic advantage, utilize their knowledge and their well-established social networks to benefit directly from the resettlement, and that the poorer farmers, who are supposed to the primary beneficiaries, get left out. Using an interface perspective and drawing on the key concepts of the actor-oriented approach enables me to interpret what has precisely happened in the resettlement process and why a development project is not simply about executing government policy. </font...|$|R

This paper describes the development and the findings of the Reference Document. The Reference Document provides a framework that is applicable to any GM crop that has been or might be grown in EU Member States. Almost 100 indicators, which range from farm adoption rates to consumer surplus, have been identified by the ESEB. The Reference Document found that evidence of impacts in the EU already exists for some crop/trait combinations both ex post and ex ante but that for most topics it is very limited. Methodologies have been developed by the scientific community for many of the topics and indicators, from simple partial budget analysis to complex aggregated models.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a two-stage analytical framework that integrates ecological crop (animal) growth and economic frontier production models to analyse the productive efficiency of crop (animal) production systems. The ecological crop (animal) growth model estimates "potential" output levels given the genetic characteristics of crops (animals) {{and the physical}} conditions of locations where the crops (animals) are grown (reared). The economic frontier production model estimates "best practice" production levels, taking into account economic, institutional and social factors that cause farm and spatial heterogeneity. In the first stage, both ecological crop growth and economic frontier production models are estimated to calculate three measures of productive efficiency: (1) technical efficiency, as the ratio of actual to "best practice" output levels; (2) agronomic efficiency, as the ratio of actual to "potential" output levels; and (3) agro-economic efficiency, as the ratio of "best practice" to "potential" output levels. Also in the first stage, the economic frontier production model identifies factors that determine technical efficiency. In the second stage, agro-economic efficiency is analysed econometrically in relation to economic, institutional and social factors that cause farm and spatial heterogeneity. The proposed framework has several important advantages in comparison with existing proposals. Firstly, it allows the systematic incorporation of all physical, economic, institutional and social factors that cause farm and spatial heterogeneity in analysing the productive performance of crop and animal production systems. Secondly, the location-specific physical factors are not modelled symmetrically as other economic inputs of production. Thirdly, climate change and technological advancements in crop and animal sciences can be modelled in a "forward-looking" manner. Fourthly, knowledge in agronomy and data from experimental studies can be utilised <b>for</b> <b>socio-economic</b> policy <b>analysis.</b> The proposed framework can be easily applied in empirical studies due to the current availability of ecological crop (animal) growth models, farm or secondary data, and econometric software packages.
