40|$|The {{thyroid gland}} in most animal species has two lobes, {{one on each}} lateral surface of the trachea. In pigs, the main lobe of the thyroid gland is on the midline in the ventral {{cervical}} region with dorsolateral projections from each side. The thyroid structural changes in gouts were investigated. About 386 pairs of thyroid glands collected from gout at the local municipal abattoir in Tabriz city of East Azerbaijan province. A total of 386 thyroid specimens examined, 8 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> follicular atrophy, 4 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> thyroid fibrosis, 71 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> diffuse hyperplasia of thyroid follicular cells, 5 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> colloid goiter, 10 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> parenchymal cysts, 3 <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> nodular hyperplasia, 1 <b>case</b> <b>was</b> C-cell adenoma and 1 <b>case</b> <b>was</b> C-cell carcinoma...|$|R
5|$|English pronouns {{conserve}} many {{traits of}} case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain {{a difference between}} subjective and objective case in most persons (I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them) {{as well as a}} gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing he/she/it). The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective <b>case</b> <b>is</b> used both {{in the sense of the}} previous accusative case (in the role of patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and in the sense of the Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb). Subjective <b>case</b> <b>is</b> used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, and otherwise the objective <b>case</b> <b>is</b> used. While grammarians such as Henry Sweet and Otto Jespersen noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example , retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.|$|E
5|$|Greenlandic is an ergative language. This means that, {{instead of}} {{treating}} the grammatical relations {{as in most}} European languages where grammatical subjects are marked with nominative case and objects with accusative, the grammatical roles are defined differently. In Greenlandic the ergative <b>case</b> <b>is</b> used for agents of transitive verbs and for possessors. Absolutive <b>case</b> <b>is</b> used for patients of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs. Research into Greenlandic as used by the younger generation {{has shown that the}} use of ergative alignment in Kalaallisut may be becoming obsolete, converting the language into a nominative–accusative language.|$|E

5|$|In addition, it {{also appears}} that an applicant's {{subjective}} motivation {{is relevant to}} {{whether he or she}} should be recognized as having public standing. If a <b>case</b> <b>is</b> brought out of ill-will or some other improper purpose, the courts will be reluctant to recognize that the applicant has standing, even if there is a public interest in the case being heard.|$|E
