5|$|In 1878, the British {{organisation}} {{now known}} as the Shire Horse Society was created, with the American Shire Horse Association beginning in 1885. The breed was exported from Britain to the United States in large numbers during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but popularity fell as mechanisation increased, reaching a low point in the 1950s and 1960s. Popularity began to increase again in the 1970s and after. However, population numbers are still considered to be at <b>critical</b> <b>levels</b> by both the UK-based Rare Breeds Survival Trust and the US-based American Livestock Breeds Conservancy.|$|E
5|$|In the lowcountry {{region of}} coastal Georgia and South Carolina, the Carolina Marsh Tacky {{was the most}} common horse for most of the breed's history. As the {{automobile}} became more common during the 20th century, breed numbers declined, and the Marsh Tacky was thought to have gone extinct during the 1980s and 1990s. Today there are 276 living animals recognized by the breed registry, including 153 mares and 123 stallions and geldings. The Equus Survival Trust considers the breed to be at critical/nearly extinct levels, meaning that there are fewer than 100 breeding mares in existence. The American Livestock Breeds Conservancy considers the Marsh Tacky (which they consider a strain of the Colonial Spanish horse) to be at <b>critical</b> <b>levels,</b> meaning that there are fewer than 200 annual registrations in the United States and an estimated global population of less than 2,000. Representatives of the ALBC state that the breed numbers will have to increase to an estimated 1,000 members to ensure permanent survival. On June 11, 2010, a bill was signed into law that made the Carolina Marsh Tacky the state heritage horse of South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Since 1977, Elizabeth II {{has been}} a patron of the Society, and during the Society's centenary year of 1984 she acted as its president. The British Cleveland Bay Horse Society also {{maintains}} a separate registry for part-bred horses. In the late 20th century, the breed again gained {{the attention of the}} United States public, and in 1985 the US association was reactivated, renamed the Cleveland Bay Society of North America. The US American Livestock Breeds Conservancy considers their status to be critical, which means there is an estimated global population of less than 2,000, and fewer than 200annual registrations in the United States. The UK Rare Breeds Survival Trust also considers their status to be critical, with less than 300breeding females registered worldwide. The Equus Survival Trust also considers the breed population to be at <b>critical</b> <b>levels,</b> meaning there are between 100 and 300breeding females left in the world. Currently, there are about 135purebred horses in the US and Canada recorded with the North American registry. There are also small populations in Japan, New Zealand, and Australia. In 2006, an estimated 550Cleveland Bay horses existed worldwide, of which about 220 were mares; the 2005 foal crop produced fewer than 50horses.|$|E
40|$|Let f=B_ 1 /B_ 2 be a {{ratio of}} finite Blaschke {{products}} having no critical points on ∂D.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{two models}} for the control of a satellite-in the first, fuel is expended in a linear fashion to move a satellite following a diffusion-where {{the aim is to}} keep the satellite above a <b>critical</b> <b>level</b> {{for as long as possible}} (or indeed to reach a higher, 'safe' level). Under suitable assumptions for the drift and diffusion coefficients, it is shown that the stochastic maximum of the time to fall below the <b>critical</b> <b>level</b> is attained by a policy which imposes a reflecting boundary at the <b>critical</b> <b>level</b> until the fuel is exhausted and jumps the satellite directly to the safe level if this is ever possible. In the second model, there is a nonlinear response to the expenditure of fuel, and no safe level.

25|$|Unemployment was {{a chronic}} problem for Yugoslavia, the {{unemployment}} rates were amongst {{the highest in}} Europe during its existence {{and they did not}} reach <b>critical</b> <b>levels</b> before the 1980s only due to the safety valve provided by sending one million guest workers yearly to advanced industrialized countries in Western Europe. The departure of Yugoslavs seeking work began in the 1950s, when individuals began slipping across the border illegally. In the mid-1960s, Yugoslavia lifted emigration restrictions and the number of emigrants increased rapidly, especially to West Germany. By the early 1970s 20 percent of the country's labor force or 1,1 million workers were employed abroad. This was also a source of capital and foreign currency for Yugoslavia.|$|E

2500|$|In 2015 the {{president}} of the Nepal Mountaineering Association warned that pollution, especially human waste, has reached <b>critical</b> <b>levels.</b> As much as [...] "26,500 pounds of human excrement" [...] each season is left behind on the mountain. Human waste is strewn across the verges of the route to the summit, making the four sleeping areas on the route up Everest's south side minefields of human excrement. Climbers above Base Camp—for the 62-year history of climbing on the mountain—have most commonly either buried their excrement in holes they dug by hand in the snow, or slung it into crevasses, or simply defecated wherever convenient, often within meters of their tents. The only place where climbers can defecate without worrying about contaminating the mountain is Base Camp. At approximately 18,000 feet, Base Camp sees the most activity of all camps on Everest because climbers acclimate and rest there. In the late-1990s, expeditions began using toilets that they fashioned from blue plastic 50-gallon barrels fitted with a toilet seat and enclosed. The problem of human waste is compounded by the presence of more anodyne waste: spent oxygen tanks, abandoned tents, empty cans and bottles. The Nepalese government now requires each climber to pack out eight kilograms of waste when descending the mountain.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the escape of species from Io's atmosphere using a steady-state model of Io's exospheric corona and its {{interaction with the}} Io plasma torus. The corona {{is assumed to be}} spherically symmetric with the radial density and compositional structure determined by the gas kinetic temperature, <b>critical</b> <b>level</b> radius, and mixing ratios of the component species. Thermal and nonthermal escape rates are calculated and the results compared with previously estimated torus and neutral cloud supply rates for O, S, Na, and K. Both oxygen- and sulfur-dominated exospheres are considered. Atmospheric sputtering is found to be the major escape mechanism for models in which the plasma flow reaches the <b>critical</b> <b>level.</b> However, such models produce total mass-loading rates an order of magnitude larger than inferred values suggesting that either (1) the structure of the thermal corona is significantly modified by the nonthermal interaction, or (2) substantial plasma flow modification and deflection occurs in the corona at or above the <b>critical</b> <b>level.</b> Assuming that the thermal model is a correct description of the corona, a comparison of these results with the observed near-Io distribution of neutral Na and estimated source rates for the neutral Na "jets" suggests an extended Na coronal component. Assuming that this component is part of the thermal exosphere, we find that the observations are consistent with an O-dominated corona, an exospheric temperature 1000 K, a 0. 001 <b>critical</b> <b>level</b> mixing ratio of Na, and a <b>critical</b> <b>level</b> radius 1. 5 R_(Io) ...|$|R
