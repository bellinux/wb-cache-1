40|$|The {{dawn of the}} {{information}} age brought to light technical and economic challenges in delivering broadband telecommunication services to subscribers in rural and remote areas; challenges created by tiny pockets of subscribers scattered over a vast network service area. Dealing with such challenges calls for an appropriate system engineering approach and the utilisation of suitable network building blocks, which could differ significantly from those of the urban areas. The aim of this thesis, therefore, was to make a distinct contribution of knowledge to enable the delivery of broadband telecommunication services to rural and remote communities in a technically-effective and economically-viable manner. The thesis viewed the <b>customer</b> <b>access</b> <b>line</b> as the crucial network building block in determining the optimal architecture of a telecommunication network, {{based on the fact that}} maximising the length of <b>customer</b> <b>access</b> <b>line</b> results in minimising the number of network nodes required to serve a given area. A <b>customer</b> <b>access</b> <b>line</b> utilising wideband VHF radio channels, capable of bridging distances of up to 100 km, would make a significant economic difference in deploying telecommunication services in rural and remote areas. For many years, narrowband VHF radio channels have been used to carry voice and low-speed data over long distances in rural and remote areas, but very little or no data is available on the use of wideband VHF radio channels. Therefore, the research focused on wideband VHF radio channel modelling and characterisation over paths extending beyond line-of-sight, where diffraction is the dominant mode of radiowave propagation. This research was mainly concerned with aspects of radiowave propagation, rather than modulation and coding schemes. Conducting radiowave propagation studies over long distances extending beyond line-of-sight is often time consuming and can be extremely expensive. Traditionally, a powerful radio channel sounder is needed for conducting such studies. In this work, a novel inexpensive wide band VHF radio channel sounding technique was developed by the candidate. The technique makes use of a VHF digital television transmitter as a source for wideband sounding signals. The receiving end of the sounder is a special configuration of two synchronised modern swept-tuned spectrum analysers and a crossed-dipole antenna array. This enables the simultaneous measurement of the co-polarised and cross-polarised components of incident radiowaves. The power spectrum traces obtained from both the analysers were then mathematically processed to produce the channel parameters. A field measurement campaign was staged for collecting primary data for eight case studies using a sma 1 l 4 -wheel drive vehicle equipped with a 6 m telescopic antenna mast. A specially developed in-situ terrain path profiling tool played a pivotal role in the investigations. In line with the aim of the thesis, the measurements were conducted over ranges from 10 to 100 km. The signals from two transmitter sites, one transmitting on horizontal and the other on vertical polarisation, were used as sources for wide band sounding signals. Field measurements were conducted using antenna height of 7 m above ground level. In conclusion, using the developed radio channel sounding technique, and under the propagation conditions described in this thesis, showed that diffraction alone has little or no effect on the performance of a 7 -MHz wide VHF radio channel. Diffraction by terrain obstacles seemed to reduce the effect of multi path. The investigation showed that low antenna height of approximately 7 m at the customer's premises can be used for distance of up to 100 km from the transmitter. The actual data transmission speed possible over a 7 -MHz wide VHF radio channel will depend on the adopted modulation and coding schemes...|$|E

40|$|We model an ATM network {{comprising}} {{an input}} quelling cell switching hub. <b>Customer</b> <b>access</b> <b>lines</b> are multiplexed into the relatively faster input links of this hub. Each access multiplexer is fed by on/off sources. Motivated {{by the fact}} that an ATM network should support both bursty as well as smooth traffic, we consider the scenario in which some multiplexers are fed by sources with long bursts of cells, and others by sources with short bursts. Here we report the results of a detailed simulation of this hub-based ATM network. Our objective is to compare the performance of various strategies for scheduling cell service in the access multiplexers, and in the ATM switch. The simulation results confirm what might be expected from the results of our earlier analytical modelling of the multiplexer and the switch in isolation (this analysis assumed a particular Markovian model for the aggregate cell arrival processes into the ATM switch). In particular, we find that, if mean burst delay is the performance criterion then, for a small ratio of ATM-Link to customer-access-line speed (less than or equal to 3 for the models and parameters we use), the more bursty traffic should undergo burst level multiplexing at the access multiplexer, and should be given lower priority during output contention resolution in the input queueing hub. If worst case delay performance (e. g., the 99. 9 percentile of the end-to-end delay of a burst) is a consideration, however, we find that, even for small ATM-link to access-line speed ratio, the best combination of strategies is that the access multiplexers should multiplex the packets from the <b>access</b> <b>lines</b> in a round-robin fashion, and the switch should still give lower priority to the burstier traffi...|$|R
40|$|Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) is a {{high-speed}} broadband Internet service that is {{best suited for}} residential use. In this paper, an analytically tractable information-theoretic model is proposed to determine optimal subchannel allocation in an ADSL system whose down-stream modem has wireline and/or wireless trunks at its input. The relevant (downstream) ADSL modem at the central office is assumed to receive packets from different types of trunks, such as optical lines, copper cables and/or wireless links, or their concatenated version. In information-theoretic point of view, this ADSL modem is modeled as a “demultiplexer ” {{in the sense that}} it selects out a specific set of bits and assigns it to an appropriate subchannel consistent with the Hartley-Shannon law specified SNR-level of the subchannels. The pertinent analyses pursued in evaluating a subchannel allocation metric (SAM) refer to the following: Hybrid CDMA/FDMA microcellular-fed fiber with a specified BER as the incoming trunk on an ADSL system and FEXT-infested copper <b>lines</b> <b>customer</b> loop <b>access</b> <b>lines.</b> The resultant performance of downs-stream ADSL traffic on subchannels is ascertained by the metric, SAM.

40|$|Adaptive {{streaming}} over HTTP {{is largely}} used to deliver live and on-demand video. It works by adjusting video quality according to network conditions. While QoE for different streaming services has been studied, {{it is still}} unclear how <b>access</b> <b>line</b> capacity impacts QoE of broadband users in video sessions. We make a first step {{to answer this question}} by characterizing parameters influencing QoE, such as frequency of video adaptations. We take a passive point of view, and analyze a dataset summarizing video sessions of a large population for one year. We first split customers based on their estimated <b>access</b> <b>line</b> capacity. Then, we quantify how the latter affects QoE metrics by parsing HTTP requests of Microsoft Smooth Streaming (MSS) services. For selected services, we observe that at least 3 ~Mbps of downstream capacity is needed to let the player select the best bitrate, while at least 6 ~Mbps are required to minimize delays to retrieve initial fragments. Surprisingly, <b>customers</b> with faster <b>access</b> <b>lines</b> obtain limited benefits, hinting to restrictions on the design of services...|$|R
