5|$|The League of Nations had devoted serious {{attention}} {{to the question of}} international intellectual <b>co-operation</b> since its creation. The First Assembly in December 1920 recommended that the Council take action aiming at the international organisation of intellectual work, which it did by adopting a report presented by the Fifth Committee of the Second Assembly and inviting a Committee on Intellectual Cooperation to meet in Geneva in August 1922. The French philosopher Henri Bergson became the first chairman of the committee. The work of the committee included: inquiry into the conditions of intellectual life, assistance to countries where intellectual life was endangered, creation of national committees for intellectual <b>co-operation,</b> <b>co-operation</b> with international intellectual organisations, protection of intellectual property, inter-university <b>co-operation,</b> co-ordination of bibliographical work and international interchange of publications, and international <b>co-operation</b> in archaeological research.|$|E

5|$|Although Malaysia's acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, who is {{also the}} country's Defence Minister, denied the {{existence}} of problems between the participating countries, academics said that because of regional conflicts, there were genuine trust issues involved in <b>co-operation</b> and sharing intelligence, and that these were hampering the search. International relations experts said entrenched rivalries over sovereignty, security, intelligence, and national interests made meaningful multilateral <b>co-operation</b> very difficult. A Chinese academic made the observation that the parties were searching independently; thus it was not a multilateral search effort. The Guardian noted the Vietnamese permission given for Chinese aircraft to overfly its airspace as a positive sign of <b>co-operation.</b> Vietnam temporarily scaled back its search operations after the country's Deputy Transport Minister cited a lack of communication from Malaysian officials despite requests for more information. China, through the official Xinhua News Agency, said that the Malaysian government ought to take charge and conduct the operation with greater transparency, a point echoed by the Chinese Foreign Ministry days later.|$|E

5|$|The Finnish and Swedish militaries {{engaged in}} wide-ranging <b>co-operation,</b> {{but it was}} more focused on the {{exchange}} of information and defence planning for the Åland islands than on military exercises or materiel. The Finnish objective was to commit the Swedes by establishing a military-political joint venture in the Åland: if the Swedes would undertake to assist Finland in fortifying the islands, then an important and useful precedent might be set. The Government of Sweden was aware of the military <b>co-operation,</b> but carefully avoided committing itself to Finnish foreign policy.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, {{bilateral}} ties were characterised {{by trade}} and economic co-operation; {{other areas of}} bilateral <b>co-operation</b> were explored from 2000 onwards.

Bilateral <b>co-operation</b> between both countries was also extended to defence matters in 2008 when another MoU was signed, which proposed for joint military trainings and collaboration in the defence industry between the Malaysian and Vietnamese militaries.

As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state. India subsequently signed <b>co-operation</b> agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E
