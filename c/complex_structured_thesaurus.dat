To enable the structure expansion, a <b>structure</b> <b>thesaurus</b> should be built first, which involves the construction of a weighted graph from XML documents and the linkage-based clustering method to cluster the nodes into several groups. After a query comes, the <b>structure</b> <b>thesaurus</b> is examined, so that for each tag in the original query, the tags in the same group are retrieved. Unrelated tags are filtered and some heuristic rules are applied to replacing the tags in the original query with the related tags and to expanding the structure. It is shown that using structure-based query expansion, the system can return result with high precision and recall. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{classical}} {{mechanics of}} {{a finite number}} of degrees of freedom requires a symplectic structure on phase space C, but it is independent of any <b>complex</b> <b>structure.</b> On the contrary, the quantum theory is intimately linked with the choice of a <b>complex</b> <b>structure</b> on C.

Then the notion of coherence is the same for all observers.

The lack of analyticity in transforming between nonbiholomorphic <b>complex</b> <b>structures</b> can be interpreted as the loss of quantum-mechanical coherence under the corresponding transformation.
