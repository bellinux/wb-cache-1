5|$|The Neptunian rings {{contain a}} large {{quantity}} of micrometer-sized dust: the dust fraction by <b>cross-section</b> <b>area</b> is between 20% and 70%. In this respect they {{are similar to}} the rings of Jupiter, in which the dust fraction is 50%–100%, and are very different from the rings of Saturn and Uranus, which contain little dust (less than 0.1%). The particles in Neptune's rings are made from a dark material; probably a mixture of ice with radiation-processed organics. The rings are reddish in color, and their geometrical (0.05) and Bond (0.01–0.02) albedos {{are similar to those of}} the Uranian rings' particles and the inner Neptunian moons. The rings are generally optically thin (transparent); their normal optical depths do not exceed 0.1. As a whole, the Neptunian rings resemble those of Jupiter; both systems consist of faint, narrow, dusty ringlets and even fainter broad dusty rings.|$|E

To describe the latter, a linear combination of two width eigenvectors with varying coefficients is proposed.

25|$|Because {{wirewound}} resistors are coils {{they have}} more undesirable inductance than other types of resistor, although winding the wire in sections with alternately reversed direction can minimize inductance. Other techniques employ bifilar winding, or a flat thin former (to reduce <b>cross-section</b> <b>area</b> of the coil). For the most demanding circuits, resistors with Ayrton-Perry winding are used.|$|E
25|$|Notice that, {{although}} it is practically convenient to compute PCSA based on volume or mass and fiber length, PCSA (and therefore the total fiber force, which is proportional to PCSA) is not proportional to muscle mass or fiber length alone. Namely, the maximum (tetanic) force of a muscle fiber simply depends on its thickness (<b>cross-section</b> <b>area)</b> and type. By no means it depends on its mass or length alone. For instance, when muscle mass increases due to physical development during childhood, this may be only due {{to an increase in}} length of the muscle fibers, with no change in fiber thickness (PCSA) or fiber type. In this case, an increase in mass does not produce an increase in force.|$|E
500|$|In {{all three}} types of {{structure}} the <b>cross-section</b> <b>area</b> of the choanocyte-lined regions {{is much greater than}} that of the intake and outlet channels. This makes the flow slower near the choanocytes and thus makes it easier for them to trap food particles. For example, in Leuconia, a small leuconoid sponge about [...] tall and [...] in diameter, water enters each of more than 80,000 intake canals at 6cm per minute. However, because Leuconia has more than 2million flagellated chambers whose combined diameter is much greater than that of the canals, water flow through chambers slows to 3.6cm per hour, making it easy for choanocytes to capture food. All the water is expelled through a single osculum at about 8.5cm per second, fast enough to carry waste products some distance away.|$|E

40|$|Magnetization {{processes}} in ultra-thin transition-metal films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are investigated. By model calculations it is shown that nucleation in ideal films is incoherent and therefore bulk-like, whereas the truly ultra-thin limit of coherent nucleation {{is restricted to}} film patches of small <b>cross-section</b> <b>areas.</b> In ideal mono-layers, the nonzero film thickness leads to bulk-like nucleation if the lateral dimensions of the film exceed about 1 mm. This means that monolayer patches having sub-micrometer diameters cannot be regarded as ultra-thin in a micro-magnetic sense. On the other hand, the critical single-domain diameter of ultra-thin films is larger by one order of magnitude than expected from bulk-type thin-film calculations...|$|R

The optimization problem searches for a truss structure of minimum volume, subject to stress constraints. The design variables are the bars <b>cross-section</b> <b>areas</b> and some nodal coordinates. Several loading conditions are also considered.

5000|$|Note {{that for}} {{engineering}} purposes, we often assume the <b>cross-section</b> <b>area</b> {{of the material}} does not change during the whole deformation process, which is not true since the actual area will decrease while deforming due to necking. The one assuming <b>cross-section</b> <b>area</b> fixed is so called “engineering stress-strain curve”, the latter is “true stress-strain curve”. In a tension test, true strain is less than engineering strain. Thus, a point defining true stress-strain curve is displaced upwards {{and to the left}} to define the equivalent engineering stress-strain curve.

They were able to cut, polish and glue together straight sections of channel waveguides of varying lengths (typically few centimeters) and cross-sections (typically few tens of microns). These waveguides were usually characterized by relatively large <b>cross-section</b> <b>areas</b> and high index contrast. As a result, unlike single mode fibers, they were multi-mode and able to maintain multiple optical modes at the same wavelength and polarization.
