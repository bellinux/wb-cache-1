Those {{methods have been}} used to grow <b>core</b> <b>shell</b> chalcogenide nanoparticles with an emphasis on better control of size, shape, and size distribution. To control the growth of nanoparticles with tunable optical properties, supporing matrices such as glasses, zeolites, polymers or fatty acids have been used. In addition, to prepare nanoparticles of sulfides, selenides and tellurides, the Langmuir-Blodgett film technique has been used successfully. In comparison to wet chemical methods, electrochemical synthesis is more desirable, {{such as the use of}} aqueous solvents rather than toxic organic solvents, formation of conformal deposits, room-temperature deposition, low cost, and precise control of composition and thickness of semiconductor coating on metal nanoparticles. However, owing to the difficulty of preparing electrically addressable arrays of nanoparticles, the use of electrochemical techniques to produce core-shell nanoparticles was difficult.

The genome is positive-sense, single-stranded RNA with a length of 27 to 29 kilobases and a 3’-polyA tail. Two large, overlapping ORFs at the 5'-end of the genome encode the major non-structural proteins expressed as a fusion protein by ribosomal frameshift. These include regions with protease, helicase and RNA polymerase motifs. There are 7 other genes downstream which encode structural proteins.

50|$|Emulsions {{can be used}} {{to create}} <b>core</b> <b>shell</b> or {{composite}} fibers without modification of the spinneret. However, these fibers are usually more difficult to produce as compared to coaxial spinning due to the greater number of variables which must be accounted for in creating the emulsion. A water phase and an immiscible solvent phase are mixed in the presence of an emulsifying agent to form the emulsion. Any agent which stabilizes the interface between the immiscible phases can be used. Surfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulfate, Triton and nanoparticles have been used successfully. During the electrospinning process the emulsion droplets within the fluid are stretched and gradually confined leading to their coalescence. If the volume fraction of inner fluid is sufficiently high, a continuous inner core can be formed.|$|E

40|$|Optical Tweezers {{are capable}} of {{trapping}} individual particles of sizes that range from micrometers to sub micrometers. One can compute the trap strength experienced by a particle by analyzing the fluctuations {{in the position of}} the trapped particle with time. It is reported that the trap strength of a dielectric bead increases linearly with increase {{in the power of the}} trapping laser. The situation with metallic particles, however, is strongly dependent on the particle size. Available literature shows that metallic Rayleigh particles experience enhanced trap strengths when compared to dielectric particles of similar sizes due to a larger polarizability. On the contrary, micrometer sized metallic particles are poor candidates for trapping due to high reflectivity. We report here that commercially available micrometer sized metal oxide <b>core</b> - dielectric <b>shell</b> (<b>core</b> – <b>shell)</b> beads are trapped in a single beam optical tweezer in a manner similar to dielectric beads. However as the laser power is increased these <b>core</b> – <b>shell</b> beads are trapped with a reduced corner frequency, which represents a lowered trap strength, in contrast to the situation with ordinary dielectric beads. We attribute this anomaly to an increase in the temperature of the medium in the vicinity of the <b>core</b> – <b>shell</b> bead due to an enhanced dissipation of the laser power as heat. We have computed autocorrelation functions for both types of beads at various trapping laser powers and observe that the variation in the relaxation times with laser power for <b>core</b> - <b>shell</b> beads is opposite in trend to that of ordinary dielectric beads. This supports our claim of an enhanced medium temperature about the trapped <b>core</b> – <b>shell</b> bead. Since an increase in temperature should lead to a change in the local viscosity of the medium, we have estimated the ratio of viscosity to temperature for <b>core</b> – <b>shell</b> and dielectric beads of the same size. We observe that while for ordinary dielectric beads this ratio remains a constant with increasing laser power, there is a decrease for <b>core</b> – <b>shell</b> beads. We plan to extend this work towards studying the hydrodynamic correlations between a pair of trapped beads where one of the beads acts as a heat source. © (2016) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

5000|$|In {{quantum dots}} the band {{energies}} {{are dependent on}} crystal size due to the quantum size effects. This enables band offset engineering in nanoscale heterostructures. It is possible {{to use the same}} materials but change the type of junction, say from straddling (type I) to staggered (type II), by changing the size or thickness of the crystals involved. The most common nanoscale heterostructure system is ZnS on CdSe (CdSe@ZnS) which has a straddling gap (type I) offset. In this system the much larger band gap ZnS passivates the surface of the fluorescent CdSe core thereby increasing the quantum efficiency of the luminescence. There is an added bonus of increased thermal stability due to the stronger bonds in the ZnS shell as suggested by its larger band gap. Since CdSe and ZnS both grow in the zincblende crystal phase and are closely lattice matched, <b>core</b> <b>shell</b> growth is preferred.

50|$|The virus encodes enzymes {{required}} for replication and transcription of its genome, including {{elements of a}} base excision repair system, structural proteins, and many proteins that are not essential for replication in cells, but instead have roles in virus survival and transmission in its hosts. Virus replication takes place in perinuclear factory areas. It is a highly orchestrated process with at least four stages of transcription—immediate-early, early, intermediate, and late. The majority of replication and assembly occurs in discrete, perinuclear regions of the cell called virus factories, and finally progeny virions are transported to the plasma membrane along microtubules where they bud out or are propelled away along actin projections to infect new cells. As the virus progresses through its lifecycle, {{most if not all}} of the host cell's organelles are modified, adapted, or in some cases destroyed. Assembly of the icosahedral capsid occurs on modified membranes from the endoplasmic reticulum. Products from proteolytically processed polyproteins form the <b>core</b> <b>shell</b> between the internal membrane and the nucleoprotein core. An additional outer membrane is gained as particles bud from the plasma membrane. The virus encodes proteins that inhibit signalling pathways in infected macrophages and thus modulate transcriptional activation of immune response genes. In addition, the virus encodes proteins which inhibit apoptosis of infected cells to facilitate production of progeny virions. Viral membrane proteins with similarity to cellular adhesion proteins modulate interaction of virus-infected cells and extracellular virions with host components.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHuman {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) Gag proteins are assembled into virus particles and then cleaved by the virion-associated HIV protease. Concomitant with Gag processing, doughnut-like HIV particles (the immature form) are converted to particles containing condensed cores (the mature form). Here {{we describe the}} in vitro processing of immature HIV Gag virus-like particles (VLP) by exogenously added HIV protease. Following delipidization, sequential processing of immature VLP showed that the matrix (MA) /capsid (CA) junction was cleaved faster than the CA/nucleocapsid (NC) junction, an altered order of processing when compared with authentic processing. When the in vitro processed VLP were analyzed on density gradients, most of the MA, CA-p 15 intermediate, and NC were detected as a highly multimeric form, equivalent to the unprocessed VLP. In contrast, CA was found as a monomer dissociated from the multimeric CA-p 15 following cleavage of the CA/NC junction. Electron microscopy revealed that the in vitro processing was accompanied by conversion of the doughnut-like particles to particles containing condensed cores and spherical outer <b>shells.</b> The <b>cores,</b> however, lacked <b>core</b> <b>shells,</b> which are normally observed for authentic HIV, suggesting that the in vitro processing of immature VLP failed to produce <b>core</b> <b>shells...</b>|$|R
