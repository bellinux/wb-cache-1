5|$|Wallace was {{attached}} to No. 2 Squadron, 1st Wing Royal Flying Corps (RFC) on 14 February 1915 as an observer, alongside William Barnard Rhodes-Moorhouse, the first serviceman of the RFC to be awarded the Victoria Cross. By July he was the squadron's senior observer and was made up to lieutenant on 21 July 1915. On 22 August 1915, Wallace was on a photographic reconnaissance mission in a B.E.2c piloted by his friend 2Lt Charles Gallie. The plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire and <b>came</b> <b>straight</b> down at Sainghin, near Lille, northern France.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the return}} of Tesche on a {{permanent}} contract seemed likely to endanger Davis's first-team place, he began the 2016–17 season in the starting eleven. He was booked {{in each of the}} first four matches, but two goals and a series of strong performances meant that when the fifth booking finally arrived in mid-October, he <b>came</b> <b>straight</b> back into the side after serving his suspension. He was named man of the match in the Second City derby against Aston Villa. Initially used on the right of midfield to counteract the attacking threat of Jordan Amavi, he moved into a more familiar central role after David Cotterill entered the match, and within minutes scored the equalising goal with a composed finish {{from the edge of the}} penalty area. The goal earned him the club's Moment of the Season award.|$|E
5|$|He {{accepted}} a teaching {{position in the}} Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati, having decided on Cincinnati over other universities, including his alma mater, Purdue, because it had a small aerospace department; he hoped that the faculty members would not be annoyed that he <b>came</b> <b>straight</b> into a professorship with only the USC master's degree. He began the work while stationed at Edwards years before, and finally completed it after Apollo11 by presenting a report on various aspects of Apollo, instead of a thesis on the simulation of hypersonic flight. The official job title he received at Cincinnati was University Professor of Aerospace Engineering. After teaching for eight years, he resigned in 1979 without explaining his reason for leaving.|$|E

At the wharf entrance, John Landers was talking with another man. About 60 feet down the wharf against the west railing, Josias Tanner and Jesse Murphy stood near each other. Frank Reid stood further on, alone. Their job was to identify Soap Gang members and prevent them from entering the meeting then in progress.|$|E

Although he took no wickets in a high-scoring draw, he was {{retained}} for the County Championship match against Somerset which followed. In this he returned an excellent match analysis of 36-24-36-5, and this set him up well to keep his place for the season. In all he took 41 first-class wickets {{at an average of}} 43.85, with a best return of 5-40 against Glamorgan in mid-May; Worcestershire lost this game by a single run.|$|E

25|$|Krause shocked Bulls fans on draft day in 2001 when he traded {{franchise}} player Brand to the Los Angeles Clippers for {{the second}} pick in the draft, Tyson Chandler. He also selected Eddy Curry with the fourth pick. Since both Chandler and Curry <b>came</b> <b>straight</b> out of high school, neither was expected to {{make much of a}} contribution for several years, but they were seen as potential franchise players. The team floundered without veteran leadership. At mid-season, the Bulls traded their top three scorers—Mercer, Artest, and Miller along with Kevin Ollie—to the Indiana Pacers for veteran guard Jalen Rose, Travis Best and Norman Richardson. There was also a change in coaching, with Floyd being dismissed in favor of assistant coach and former Bulls co-captain Bill Cartwright, following a series of arguments with players and management. The Bulls improved from 15 to 21 wins, although they were still tied for last in the league.|$|E
25|$|In 1902, aged only ten, Kramer {{ran away}} from his new home in Leeds, taking various jobs in {{different}} parts of the north of England, and even going away to sea for six months, being big for his age. During this sojourn away from his family Kramer attended occasional art classes, but his first formal art education was at Leeds School of Art where he had a scholarship from 1907 till 1913. During this time he was also to become involved in the radical modernist organisation the Leeds Arts Club, which introduced him to the ideas of expressionist artists, such as Wassily Kandinsky and the spiritualist beliefs that came to underpin his work. Writing to his close friend and fellow Arts Club member Herbert Read in 1918, Kramer stated that when he looked at an object he saw both its physical appearance and its spiritual manifestation. His struggle, he claimed, was to escape the physical appearance and only paint the spiritual form. Such ideas <b>came</b> <b>straight</b> from the expressionist and Theosophical spiritualism that dominated the Leeds Arts Club, and show clearly that Kramer was himself an English Expressionist artist.|$|E

In [...] "Klaus and Greta", Franco starts a fraudulent romance with Jenna in order to dismiss rumors that he is in love with a Japanese body pillow. According to a CNN report, following the broadcast, the subplot of Franco in love with a body pillow <b>came</b> <b>straight</b> from an article from The New York Times Magazine, published in July 2009, in which the article, deemed controversial, focused on a man in his mid-thirties who carries around a body pillow printed with an animated Japanese female character.|$|E

500|$|It {{fell to the}} {{commander}} of the UK-based US Third Air Force, Major General Roscoe C. Wilson, to initiate Project E. Wilson was a fortunate choice for this role; he had been the liaison officer with the Manhattan Project, and Deputy Chief of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, and was thoroughly familiar with nuclear weapons. The first aircraft to be fitted for American atomic bombs were not V-bombers but 28 Canberra bombers earmarked as night interdictors for the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) in 1957. These were new B(I)8 models, which <b>came</b> <b>straight</b> from the manufacturer for modification to carry the Mark 7 nuclear bomb. The intention was that {{they would be able to}} carry either American or British bombs, but since British bombs were not available, they were only fitted for American bombs. Later model Canberras would be able to carry both. Since the specifications for the bomb bay doors said they opened [...] wide, and the tail fins of the bombs were between [...] wide, no problem was anticipated, but it turned out that the doors only opened between , depending on the aircraft, which meant that the bombs would have to be individually matched with aircraft. After some thought, [...] was cut off each bomb fin.|$|E
500|$|The final {{night of}} {{recording}} {{was held on}} January 28, 1985, at A Recording Studios in Hollywood. Michael Jackson arrived at 9pm, earlier than the other artists, to record his solo section and record a vocal chorus by himself. He was subsequently joined in the recording studio by the remaining USA for Africa artists, who included Ray Charles, Billy Joel, Diana Ross, Cyndi Lauper, Bruce Springsteen and Smokey Robinson. Also in attendance were five of Jackson's siblings: Jackie, LaToya, Marlon, Randy and Tito. Many of the participants <b>came</b> <b>straight</b> from an American Music Award ceremony, which had been held that same night. Invited musician Prince, who {{would have had a}} part in which he and Michael Jackson sang to each other, did not attend the recording session. The reason given for his absence has varied. One newspaper claimed that the singer did not want to record with other acts. Another report, from the time of [...] "We Are the World"'s recording, suggested that the musician did not want to partake in the session because organizer Bob Geldof called him a [...] "creep". Prince did, however, donate an exclusive track, [...] "4 The Tears In Your Eyes", for the We Are the World album. In all, more than 45 of America's top musicians participated in the recording, and another 50 had to be turned away. Upon entering the recording studio, the musicians were greeted by a sign pinned to the door which read, [...] "Please check your egos at the door." [...] They were also greeted by Stevie Wonder, who proclaimed that if the recording was not completed in one take, he and Ray Charles, two blind men, would drive everybody home.|$|E
500|$|Derrickson and Marvel had {{originally}} discussed him writing the film alongside his Sinister co-writer C. Robert Cargill, with Derrickson also directing, but Marvel {{felt that they}} would not be able to reach their intended release date of July 2016 if Derrickson filled both roles. When Derrickson was chosen as director, Marvel passed on Cargill as an individual writer, with Jon Spaihts hired to rewrite the script instead. Spaihts, a big fan of Doctor Strange as a child, had started [...] "pestering" [...] Marvel as soon as he read reports of the company searching for a director for the film. This eventually led to him meeting with the studio, before they actually began looking for writers for the film. Spaihts said that they talked [...] "all afternoon, and the fit was right", but he received a call from Marvel several days later saying that they were not completely sure they wanted to take the film in the same direction as Spaihts, and were going to look at other writers. Spaihts told his agent to not [...] "take that answer. Call them back, tell them there’s a lot of right answers, and get me back in the room", and after talking with Marvel for [...] "another three or four hours" [...] he was given the job. Marvel never seriously looked at any other writer for the film. Derrickson was already hired when Spaihts joined, and the pair spent several months working on the film's story with Feige and executive producer Stephen Broussard. They started writing the film from the beginning, and initially were unsure whether it would be an origin story, or if it would begin with Strange already as a [...] "fully-formed" [...] sorcerer. Spaihts ultimately felt that [...] "the origin story of this character, as depicted in the comics, is so operatic and beautiful, and so tragic and epic in its sweep, that it was unavoidable. We had to tell that story, and tell our best version of it." [...] Elements from Spaihts' early drafts that he later stated were still in the final film include many of the film's set pieces, such as the climactic battle, which <b>came</b> <b>straight</b> from Derrickson, as well as [...] "little things" [...] from Spaihts, [...] "like a bandaged hand running down a row of prayer bells in a Nepalese temple." [...] Derrickson wanted Nightmare to be the film's antagonist, along with the concept of [...] "nightmares themselves as being a dimension", but Feige felt [...] "getting across the idea of the Dream Dimension as another dimension" [...] would have been challenging alongside everything else that the film introduces. Dormammu, [...] "the most present villain in the comics", became the film's main villain.|$|E
