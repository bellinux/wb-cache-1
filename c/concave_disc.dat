6000|$|The lagoons {{of all the}} atolls in the {{southern}} part of the Archipelago are from ten to twenty fathoms deeper than those in the northern part. This is well exemplified in the case of Addoo, {{the southern}}most atoll in the group, for although only nine miles in its longest diameter, it has a depth of thirty-nine fathoms, whereas all the other small atolls have comparatively shallow lagoons; I can assign no adequate cause for this difference in depth. In the central and deepest part of the lagoons, the bottom consists, as I am informed by Captain Moresby, of stiff clay (probably a calcareous mud); nearer the border it consists of sand, and in the channels through the reef, of hard sand-banks, sandstone, conglomerate rubble, and a little live coral. Close outside the reef and the line joining its detached portions (where intersected by many channels), the bottom is sandy, and it slopes abruptly into unfathomable depths. In most lagoons the depth is considerably greater in the centre than in the channels; but in Tilla-dou-Matte, where the marginal ring-formed reefs stand far apart, the same depth is carried across the entire atoll, from the deep-water line on one side to that on the other. I cannot refrain from once again remarking on the singularity of these atolls,--a great sandy and generally <b>concave</b> <b>disc</b> rises abruptly from the unfathomable ocean, with its central expanse studded and its border symmetrically fringed with oval basins of coral-rock, just lipping the surface of the sea, sometimes clothed with vegetation, and each containing a little lake of clear water! ...|$|E

40|$|Centrifugal {{fertilizer}} spreaders are {{the most}} commonly used type in Europe. Their possible inaccuracy results in extra fertilizer being spread, which contributes strongly to environmental imbalance. This imbalance can only be corrected if the correct amount of fertilizer lands in the right place. Accuracy depends on understanding the spreading process from the vane to the soil. This knowledge enables the development of a feedback system that adjusts the spreader settings to the measured spread pattern. The spatial distribution of fertilizer granules on the soil can be predicted by a ballistic flight model based on the measurement of the velocities, directions, pellet size and angular distribution of the pellets. Several models have been proposed to meet this challenge. In an earlier study we proposed a standard camera and a strobe combined with a cross-correlation image-processing algorithm to determine the motion parameters of the pellets at ejection. This system is highly accurate for predicting spread patterns, but only for flat discs, as it only measures the 2 D information of the ballistic flight of the pellets. Information on the third dimension will make this model more applicable in practice, as most centrifugal spreaders have <b>concave</b> <b>discs.</b> We developed a 3 D image acquisition system based on stereoscopy to characterize the spreading process.

There is some observational motivation to at least consider the role that an effectively <b>concave</b> <b>disc</b> surface might play: (1) a reprocessed fraction 1 / 2 in some Seyferts and possibly in the X-ray background, and (2) the commonality of a sharp iron line peak for Seyferts at 6. 4 KeV despite a dependence of peak location on inclination angle for flat disc models. Here it is shown that a <b>concave</b> <b>disc</b> may not only provide a larger total fraction of reprocessed photons, but can also reprocess a much larger fraction of photons in its outer regions when compared to a flat disc. This reduces the sensitivity of the 6. 4 KeV peak location to the inner disc inclination angle because the outer regions are less affected by Doppler and gravitational effects. If the X-ray source is isotropic, the reprocessed fraction is directly determined by the concavity. If the X-ray source is anisotropic, the location of iron line peak can still be determined by concavity but the total reflected fraction need not be as large as for the isotropic emitter case.

40|$|International audienceAim: Comparison of {{activities}} within two regions {{of interest in}} a slice is of prime importance in nuclear medicine. To ensure the reliability of such comparisons, a full knowledge of the statistical properties of the noise in the slices is mandatory. As reconstruction algorithms do not preserve the Poisson distribution, this information is not straightforward. Computationally expensive algorithms are available to predict the variances of pixel values, but they remain hardly compatible with the clinical settings. We have shown recently {{that the use of}} multi-scaled tilings in the slices allows the computation of a projection procedure that takes into account all the projection schemes associated with various geometrical models including the <b>concave</b> <b>disc</b> or the spatial dependent Gaussian projection. This approach leads to projection and backprojection algorithms whose outputs are interval-valued. The lengths of these interval-valued projections are highly correlated to the variances of the distribution of the corresponding usual (non interval-valued) backprojection. Materials & methods: Using interval arithmetic operators, the interval-valued projection procedure is used to create an interval-based version of the usual SIRT algorithm. 100 noisy projections of a Zubal phantom were used to reconstruct 100 interval-valued slices using this modified SIRT algorithm. Similarly, a cylindrical phantom filled with 740 MBq of a technetium 99 m solution was used to reconstruct 25 interval-valued slices. For each pixel location, we have computed the length and the median value of the reconstructed interval, and then we have compared the mean of these lengths and the standard deviation of these median values over the 100 or 25 reconstructions. Results: Using the Zubal and the cylindrical phantoms, the lengths of the interval-valued reconstructed activities increased with the iteration number. When convergence is reached, the mean lengths were highly correlated with the standard deviations of the median values (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0. 85 and 0. 84 respectively for the Zubal and the cylindrical phantom). Conclusion: These first experimental results showed that interval-valued projection and backprojection procedures can be used in the core of algebraic reconstruction algorithms to provides tomographic reconstructions in which the reconstructed pixel activities are computed together with an information that is correlated to the their noise levels. Further studies are now necessary to check if this additional information can be used to decide whether activities reconstructed in two regions of interest are significantly different...|$|E
40|$|Shallow {{cultivation}} to a {{depth of}} 5 - 7 cm has in the last years become a realistic alternative to common ploughless tillage (cultivation depth 1 0 - 15 cm), especially in Great Britain, France and Germany. Shallow cultivation means avoiding unnecessary soil loosening, preserving the soils natural structure, increasing activity in the top layer and decreasing fuel consumption with less power requirement. Two years ago VäderstadVerken AB developed a tillage tool for shallow cultivation called Rexius Carrier with System Disc. The tool consists of a heavy roller and a front tool called Systern Disc. The front tool includes two rows of <b>concave,</b> close mounted <b>discs,</b> which combined with a trave 1 ing speed of 10 - 14 km/h leaves a well leveled, 100 % work through, top layer. The aim of this thesis was to test shallow cultivation with Rexius Carrier under Swedish conditions, as autumn cultivation and as spring cultivation after a catch crop. This thesis includes the results of three different series of field experiments. The first, "Minimized autumn tillage to a spring crop", R 2 - 4122, was started in the autumn 2000. The result of the trial showed the highest yield for mouldboard ploughing and the lowest for the shallow cultivation, with deeper ploughless tillage in between. The second series, "Spring seeding without autumn tillage, including a catch crop", R 2 - 4123, was started in the spring of 2001. The series contained three experiments on sites with different clay contents, and compared autumn and spring ploughing with ploughless tillage to different depths and with different tillage intensities. The shallow cultivation performed well in this comparison. Despite a less suitable seedbed, plant establishment and crop yield in the shallow cultivated plots was nearly as high as for autumn ploughing. The weed population was greatly reduced in the shallow cultivated plots. The spring ploughed plots had less sui 1 able seedbed properties, poorer germination, more weed and lower crop yield than autumn ploughed plots. The third series, "Shallow cultivation to winter seed", started in the autumn of 200 1. In this series conventional mouldboard ploughing was compared with shallow cultivation with Rexius Carrier, chisel ploughing with and without roller and heavy disc harrow with and without roller. Before the second cultivation the germination of weeds and volunteers was counted, without any differences between different treatments. Before the seeding, the amount of straw and stubble on the surface was compared using digital image analysis. No differences between the treatments were found. After the seeding, the seedbed properties and the plant establishment was determined. Due to the large amount of rain that fell in the autumn, which had an equalizing effect on the analyzed parameters, {{no significant differences between the}} treatments were found. The trials has shown that only shallow cultivation before seeding can give good opportunities for the following crop. The trial R 2 - 4123 showed that shallow spring cultivation after a catch crop can maintain harvest yield compared to conventional mouldboard ploughing. Shallow autumn cultivation has a future as an alternative to conventional methods. The plant establishment were quite comparable despite the large amount of rain that fell in the autumn...|$|R
40|$|Tammar wallaby {{spermatozoa}} undergo maturation during transit {{through the}} epididymis. This maturation {{differs from that}} seen in eutherian mammals because in addition to biochemical and functional maturation there are also major changes in morphology, in particular formation of the condensed acrosome and reorientation of the sperm head and tail. Of spermatozoa released from the testes, 83 % had a large immature acrosome. By the time spermatozoa reached the proximal cauda epididymis 100 % of sperm had condensed acrosomes. Similarly 86 % of testicular spermatozoa had immature thumb tack or T shape head-tail orientation while only 2 % retained this immature morphology in the corpus epididymis. This maturation {{is very similar to}} that reported for the common brush tail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula. However, morphological maturation occurred earlier in epididymal transit in the tammar wallaby. By the time spermatozoa had reached the proximal cauda epididymis no spermatozoa had an immature acrosome and thumbtack orientation. Associated with acrosomal maturation was an increase in acrosomal thiols and the formation of disulphides which presumably account for the unusual stability of the wallaby sperm acrosome. The development of motility and progressive motility of tammar wallaby spermatozoa {{is similar to that of}} other marsupials and eutherian mammals. Spermatozoa are immotile in the testes and the percentage of motile spermatozoa and the strength of their motility increases during epididymal transit. During passage through the caput and corpus epididymis, spermatozoa first became weakly motile in the proximal caput and then increasingly progressively motile through the corpus epididymis. Tammar wallaby spermatozoa collected from the proximal cauda epididymis had motility not different from ejaculated spermatozoa. Ultrastructural studies indicated that acrosomal condensation involved a complex infolding of the immature acrosome. At spermiation the acrosome of tammar wallaby spermatozoa was a relatively large flat or <b>concave</b> <b>disc</b> which projected laterally and anteriorly beyond the limits of the nucleus. During transit of the epididymal caput and proximal corpus the lateral projections folded inwards to form a cup like structure the sides of which eventually met and fused. The cavity produced by this fusion was lost as the acrosome condensed to its mature form as a small button-like structure contained within the depression on the anterior end of the nucleus. During this process the dorsal surface of the immature acrosome and its outer acrosomal membrane and overlying plasma membrane were engulfed into the acrosomal matrix. This means that the dorsal surface of the acrosomal region of the testicular tammar wallaby sperm head is a transient structure. The dorsal acrosomal surface of the mature spermatozoon appears ultrastructurally to be the relocated ventral surface of the acrosomal projections which previously extended out beyond the acrosomal depression on the dorsal surface of the nucleus of the immature spermatozoon...|$|E
