40|$|Paper {{presented}} {{during the}} Annual Conference of the Philosophical Society of Southern Africa, 16 - 18 January 2008. Hosted by the Department of Philosophy, University of Pretoria. ABSTRACT: In the Phenomenology of Spirit Hegel provides his main {{discussion of the}} theme of recognition as it appears {{in the relationship between}} self and other. Recognition within his framework carries a certain amount of ambiguity. Recognition carries a sense of hope but simply if one <b>can</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> the domination <b>that</b> accompanies human relations. This means that recognition can be defined in terms that are detrimental to the other as conveyed in the master / slave dialectic that Hegel provides. The dynamic underpinning of this dialectic is taken up by Fanon in his critique of Western colonialism. Fanon’s critique is also a blow for the idea of mutual, reciprocal recognition because the master / slave dialectic was implicit in human relations in the colonies. Fanon provides a picture of this relation in terms of race, and recognition becomes a problematic notion in light of the Western conception of race. I would like to contend that Fanon’s work does not necessarily have to find its conclusion in a suspicious (and violent) notion of recognition. There is the possibility of an optimistic moment in his work where engagement with the other rests on mutual and reciprocal recognition...|$|R

They are associated with social, economic and political selfishness. A party interests that become the whole. A restricted loyalty. Understood in this way, his “alter ego” by definition can only be the universalism, that is, a set of principles and resources more truly "social" and associated with cooperative spirit, extended solidarity and generalized trust. Particularism, however, and the wealth of relational resources that exemplifies, is not antisocial by definition.

These risks are rather timeless in Italy if we consider that, despite centuries of disputes and different interpretations of the history of Rome, the greatest historians of all ages have always agreed on the central role of patronage in the Roman and Italian history and in the particular feature of the imperial court in promoting patronage network. Considering the current courtesans degeneration of power, the proposed paper will examine the border that makes a-social the existing relationships and that makes social ties no longer able to capitalize on the union in terms of social and political integration...|$|R
40|$|Kurt Vonnegut, one of {{the most}} known writers of the 20 th century American Literature, has always been more {{concerned}} with ideas than with characterization. In most of his works, Vonnegut probes the question of why people commit atrocities and how they <b>can</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> their conscience. <b>That</b> is why he chooses humor to make readers confront the pains and sufferings. Even though Vonnegut always denied any kind of label, we can agree that he deserves to be called a Black Humorist. The term, in fact, has caused discussions among literary scholars, especially concerning the difference between black humor and satire. But in the 1960 s, Bruce Friedman wrote a book called Black Humor that includes several contemporary writers. He said that writers like J. Barth, J. Heller, K. Vonnegut and others could be considered black humorists because they make readers laugh at hopeless situations. However, nothing could explain black humor – or as he called it “gallows humor ” – better than Vonnegut did, when he says in Wampeters, Foma & Granfalloons: “The biggest laughs are based on the biggest disappointments and the biggest fears”. (258) Jokes and laughs in dangerous and difficult situations are found in most of his novels, like “Slaughterhouse-Five”, “Mother Night”, “Cat’s Cradle”, etc. So, Black Humor calls attention to a significant part of Vonnegut’s fiction. That is the aim of this paper: to show how he chooses comedy to face the atrocities and sufferings of 20 th century...|$|R
40|$|After {{a decade}} of toxic {{political}} debates and a policy bonfire, {{there is an opportunity}} to forge a stable and compelling policy on climate change that could be supported by both sides of politics. Abipartisan approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions is within reach. This policy roadmap builds on the Coalition’s current climate policies while maintaining direction towards the long-term target. Its recommendations are designed to ensure both environmental credibility and the predictability essential to attract investment in clean technology. An economy-wide carbon price remains the ideal climate policy. But pragmatism and urgency demand a practical, next-best approach. Grattan’s assessment of Australia’s climate change options against a range of criteria indicates that none is perfect. Trade-offs are needed for a policy that both major parties <b>can</b> <b>live</b> <b>with,</b> and <b>that</b> will achieve the commonly agreed objective. The roadmap allows a Coalition government to modify its Safeguard Mechanism so that it no longer merely prevents emissions from going up, but drives them down in line with agreed targets – and via steps <b>that</b> are consistent <b>with</b> its political constraints. Equally, it shows how a future Labor government could take the Coalition’s policy framework and move to its preferred emissions trading model. Government should take three steps. First, it should tighten the emissions limits (‘baselines’) of the Safeguard Mechanism in line with Australia’s agreed targets. This forces our largest emitters to make significant reductions in their emissions. Next, it should auction tradeable permits that allow businesses to emit above the baselines, but within the target trajectory to 2030. This step ensures that reductions are achieved at lowest possible cost. The third step is to expand the Safeguard Mechanism to cover more emitters while reducing baselines to zero. Businesses covered by the scheme will then have to hold permits for all their emissions. This final step, which should be taken within a decade, creates the structure to deliver tougher future targets at low cost. <b>With</b> bipartisan agreement <b>that</b> Australia must move to a low-emissions economy, this report aims to provide a clear and workable plan for how to get there...|$|R

40|$|The phrase "canopy management" has {{recently}} become trendy in many New World grapegrowing areas. Interestingly enough, the concepts {{are not new}} and are generally acknowledged in Old World viticulture, though often these empirical observations are misinterpreted, as we will soon show. It was Nelson Shaulis of Cornell University who developed ideas of canopy management, especially for New World audiences, which culminated in his description in 1966 of the Geneva Double Curtain. Shaulis' studies showed him that the primary limiting factor in modern vineyard production was sunlight, once pests, diseases, and weed competition were overcome. Widely spaced rows alternating with dense vine canopies was standard vineyard practice. While the exterior leaves were well exposed, there was {{a high proportion of}} shaded interior leaves and fruit, which was shown to have negative effects on both yield and fruit composition. The solution was to divide dense canopies, and he found that an improved trellis system was preferable to closer row spacing. Although published over twenty years ago, there has been a reluctance to accept some of these basic biological principles. Probably a major reason was that the initial studies were with Labruscana grapes (Concord) and many believed the same results would not apply to Vitis vinifera, the European winegrape. Also, many believed that similar responses would not be obtained in "sunny" climates, like California or Australia. These same people had obviously never measured light levels in the center of dense canopies - they are equally low in "sunny" as in "cloudy" climates, and both inferior from a vine physiology point of view! Another major reason was the reluctance of researchers to evaluate other peoples' ideas or systems. This disturbing trend is still evident. While some may claim lack of mechanization as an impediment to local evaluation, it is noteworthy that Shaulis developed GDC for both mechanical harvesting and pruning. There were, however, a few converts to the Shaulis approach. During the early 1970 's, Dr. Cesare Intrieri of Italy, Dr. Alain Carbonneau of France, and I (Richard Smart of Australia) learned from Shaulis and further developed these ideas for vinifera winegrapes. The results were equally encouraging, and now, in the late 1980 's, canopy management is being actively researched throughout the New World. Over centuries of trial and error and empirical observation, the Europeans have determined vineyard factors important for wine quality - and, by the way, vineyard factors are regarded as more important than cellar practices generally! Several adages come to us from Europe, to wit: "A struggling vine makes the best wine" and the old favorite "High yield gives lower quality". I understand why there is support for these ideas and recognize that they do represent reasonable observation. But, like most empirical dogma, they are not necessarily correct. They show association only and do not prove cause and effect. A feature of both low vigor ("struggling vines") and low yields is that the canopies are open. That is, most leaves and fruit are exposed. As one increases yield, this is invariably accompanied by an increase in shading. Similarly, high vigor means long shoots and more and bigger leaves, and this also increases shading. Perhaps it is not the "high vigor" or the "high yield" that cause reduced quality, but more shading. This is the central idea to what we regard as proper canopy management. The last two decades have witnessed many studies of canopy microclimate and effects on wine quality. These studies have demonstrated similar responses with a range of varieties and over a range of climates, from "hot" to 11 cool". I have personally witnessed experimental wine tasting where wine judges (competent enologists all) thought they were tasting wines from different regions and were impressed to learn they all came from the same vineyard, the only difference being in canopy management. We might add a word here about our Ruakura philosophy of canopy management. Our primary aim is to improve quality. It turns out that as we improve quality by canopy management, yields also increase. We <b>can</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> Also, we are interested in mechanization. We believe the future lies in mechanization of all vineyard operations, including harvest, winter pruning, and summer pruning as well as cultivation and spraying. While we understand that Oregon growers are not at the moment as concerned with mechanization, that may change along with immigration laws in the future. Our goal is to maximize quality and minimize unit cost of production. This article is written as a series of questions and answers - we anticipate the question, then answer it! Hope we get the questions right...|$|E
30|$|In this paper, Kano Model {{was used}} for data {{collection}} and analysis. Berger et al. (1993) extension of Kano Model (Kano et al. 1984) was applied in determining the coefficient of customer satisfaction. A Kano questionnaire [based on the Kano model (Matzler et al. 1996)] was constructed and administered to fifty (50) respondents during the Kano survey and survey ethics were duly observed. The survey was designed to capture requirements for an E-Ebola Awareness System, an online e-Health awareness system. It is intended that this system will be built with quality in mind, right early from the elicitation of requirements. The requirement elicitation process takes the end-user into account such that the requirements gathered are does that satisfy and delight them. The Kano questionnaire design was adopted from (Matzler et al. 1996). The research participants were staff and students of Universiti Utara Malaysia, Malaysia. All participants are potential users of the proposed e-Ebola Awareness System (E-Easy) and all had pre-knowledge of the Ebola Virus Disease. With the sample size of fifty (50) the expected margin of error was 13  %. To remove inconsistency and bias, two questions were asked for each requirement elicited (following the Kano model); {{one of the questions}} was a functional (positive) question while the other was dysfunctional (negative). Each question (functional or dysfunctional), has a list of five options that respondents can select from. The options are: (1) I like it; (2) it must be; (3) I am neutral; (4) I <b>can</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> it; (5) I dislike it. The first question was asked to find out how the users/customers feel if the proposed feature is in place or requirement is met while the second question was to find out how they feel if the intended feature is not in place or requirement is not met. Each of the questions (whether functional or dysfunctional), has a list of five options, namely: (1) “I like it that way” (like), (2) “It must be that way” (must-be), (3) “I am neutral” (neutral), (4) “I <b>can</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> it <b>that</b> way” (<b>live</b> <b>with),</b> (5) “I dislike it that way” (dislike). After the survey, the result was tallied and totaled to show how the majority of users/customers expressed their requirements, and this was categorized into M “Must-Be”, O “One-Dimensional”, A “Attractive”, I “Indifferent”, R “Reverse” and Q “Questionable” categories. Concerning the “Questionable” category, the user has no opinion on the requirement. The answer to this question in the questionnaire by the potential user does not really make sense. They represent contradictions or misunderstandings in the requirements and indicate incorrectly phrased requirements, misunderstanding of requirements, or an incorrect response. The highest tally/count among the totals of each of these categories for a given requirement is picked as the category for the requirement. The rule for evaluation is: “M > O > A > I”. This rule guides decisions when making decisions on which feature/requirement has more influence on the perceived quality of the proposed software product (especially when their values are the same) (Li-Li et al. 2011; Supply Chain Opz 2015).|$|R

I Tradition {{has it that the}} main problems of philosophy include the nature of knowledge. But, in recent decades, questions of knowledge seem to have been marginalized by questions of justification. Thus, according to Crispin Wright, … knowledge is not really the proper central concern of epistemologico-sceptical enquiry. […] We <b>can</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> the concession <b>that</b> we do not, strictly, know {{some of the things we}} believed ourselves to know, provided we can retain the thought that we are fully justified in accepting them. (1991, p. 88; Wright’s italics) Similarly, John Earman argues that accounts of knowledge are irrelevant to the philosophy of science, because in it … the main concern is rarely whether or not a scientist “knows” that some theory is true but rather whether or not she is justified in believing it. (1993, p. 37) 1 Once Gettier showed in 1963 that justified true belief is insufficient for knowledge, and therefore that knowledge is unnecessary for justified true belief, it became natural to ask: if you can have justified true beliefs, why bother with knowledge? 2 There is a lacuna in the case for the unimportance of knowledge. Grant, for the sake of argument, that knowledge is important only if it is some- 1 Earman is discussing externalist accounts of knowledge, but the quoted comment would clearly apply to internalist accounts too. Earman’s further point, that “because science is a community enterprise the only forms of justification that are scientifically relevant are those which are stateable and open to public scrutiny”, may be most relevant to externalist accounts. See also Craig (1990, p. 272). For the contrary view that scepticism about knowledge entails scepticism about rationality and justification see Unger (1975, pp. 197 – 249) ...|$|R
