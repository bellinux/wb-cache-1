The research questions are: (1) was the spatial distribution of regional income random; (2) how helpful are traditional explanations - coal and institutions - of regional income; (3) how helpful is market potential when controlling for traditional explanations; and (4) did market potential have an effect on other determinants of income? This dissertation finds that: (1) the distribution of regional per capita income increasingly concentrated in the northwest; that there was little tendency to income convergence; and regional inequalities were higher within than between countries; (2) while a measure of regional institutions is correlated with income, simple distance-to-coal and a cost-to-coal measures are not; (3) market potential has a significant effect on income; foreign market potential more so than domestic; and increasing core relative to peripheral market potential results in perpherial income losses; and (4) changes in literacy rates, a proxy for human capital, responded to changes in market potential. In conclusion, a new economic geography framework with market potential at its core fits the historical experience well. Certain regions performed better than others generally because they had cheaper access to markets. At the start of the period, trade costs were high, and so economic activity - long concentrated in Britain - was spread out more or less evenly across the Continent. By the end of the period, when trade costs dropped dramatically, economic activity concentrated in the northwest of Europe at the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The stylized {{fact that}} {{regional}} concentration is lower in Europe {{than in the}} US has lead to the prediction that <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Single Market might increase spatial concentration in Europe. This has raised some fears that {{the social and political}} burden of rapid change might counterbalance the economic gains, that the core might win at <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> and that concentration of industry might make countries more vulnerable to asymmetric shocks in the Monetary Union. This paper uses a new disaggregated data set to substantiate whether spatial concentration increased during the nineties- the Post Single Market period, as we call it for short. Most other studies have not extended beyond the early nineties or have used less comprehensive and detailed data sets. The main result is that geographic concentration did not increase, but rather decreased during the nineties. Industrial patterns of geographic concentration and its dynamics partly conformed to the hypotheses provided by economic geography, trade theory and industrial organization...|$|R

[EN] The debt crisis, {{emerged in}} Greece in <b>the</b> second quarter <b>of</b> 2010, has quickly spread {{among the other}} {{peripheral}} countries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> euro zone with troubled fiscal and banking sectors. The fact that a significant portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bail-out <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> countries {{was put on the}} core countries has given rise to the debate on the structural differences between the cores and the peripheries; and ignited the discussion on <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disintegration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monetary union. This note assesses <b>the</b> decision <b>of</b> leaving <b>the</b> euro from <b>the</b> perspective <b>of</b> both <b>periphery</b> and core economies. Although at a first glance the euro break-up seems to have the potential to boost economic growth in peripheries through more competitive currency rates, an in-depth analysis illustrates that <b>the</b> economic <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> leaving <b>the</b> euro is rather high. As for the core countries, while leaving the monetary union presents an opportunity to abate <b>the</b> burden <b>of</b> financing <b>periphery</b> debt in <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> maintaining <b>the</b> common currency, <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> financial linkages are likely to bring about negative effects. ...|$|R

40|$|Within <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> motor control, {{there is}} no {{consensus}} on which kinematic and kinetic aspects of movements are planned or controlled. Perturbing goal-directed movements is a frequently used tool to answer this question. To be able to draw conclusions about motor control from kinematic responses to perturbations, a model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> (i. e., <b>the</b> skeleton, muscle-tendon complexes, and spinal reflex circuitry) is required. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present study was to determine to what extent such conclusions depend on <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> simplification with which <b>the</b> dynamical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> are modeled. For this purpose, we simulated fast goal-directed single-joint movement with four existing types of models. We tested how three types of perturbations affected movement trajectory if motor commands remained unchanged. We found that <b>the</b> four types <b>of</b> models <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> showed different robustness to the perturbations, leading to different predictions on how accurate motor commands need to be, i. e., how accurate <b>the</b> knowledge <b>of</b> external conditions needs to be. This means that when interpreting kinematic responses obtained in perturbation experiments <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> error correction attributed to adaptation of motor commands depends on <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> model used to describe <b>the</b> <b>periphery...</b>|$|R
