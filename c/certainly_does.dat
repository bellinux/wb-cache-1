5|$|Dawkins is an atheist, and is {{well known}} for his {{criticism}} of creationism and intelligent design. In The Blind Watchmaker (1986), he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. In The God Delusion (2006), Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> not exist and that religious faith is a delusion. He opposes the teaching of creationism in schools.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, {{a planet}} around Alpha Centauri B was announced, but in 2015 a new {{analysis}} {{concluded that it}} almost <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> not exist and was just a spurious artefact of the data analysis.|$|E
25|$|Typically {{this element}} is {{expressed}} as {{the intent to}} commit a felony “therein”. The {{use of the word}} “therein” adds nothing and <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> not limit the scope of burglary to those wrongdoers who break and enter a dwelling intending to commit a felony on the premises. The situs of the felony does not matter, and burglary occurs if the wrongdoer intended to commit a felony at the time he broke and entered.|$|E

25|$|The coachwhip {{trevally}} has had extremely {{little information}} collected regarding its diet, ecological interactions, reproduction and growth. Based on other {{fish in the}} same genus, it is certainly a predatory fish, although its diet is wholly unknown. The species is of very little importance to fisheries, and <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> not have catch statistics kept for it, usually counted among other species of trevally. It is usually taken as bycatch in trawling and hook and line fisheries.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} {{in what ways}} silica is {{important}} in the nutrition of animals. This field of research is challenging because silica is ubiquitous and in most circumstances dissolves in trace quantities only. All the same it <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> occur in the living body, leaving us with the problem {{that it is hard to}} create proper silica-free controls for purposes of research. This makes it difficult to be sure when the silica present has had operative beneficial effects, and when its presence is coincidental, or even harmful. The current consensus is that it certainly seems important in the growth, strength, and management of many connective tissues. This is true not only for hard connective tissues such as bone and tooth but possibly in the biochemistry of the subcellular enzyme-containing structures as well.|$|E

Tucker also noted that the segment involving Hogan, Austin and the Rock was [...] "meaningless, surreal and a lot of fun". Tucker concluded by saying that the event was [...] "easily one of the best Manias of the last ten years" [...] and that [...] "the future <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> look bright.

500|$|Grant {{has been}} more direct in his {{description}} of Anarky's virtuous attributes: [...] "In my eyes, Anarky's a hero. Anarky's the hero I want to be if I was smart enough and physically fit enough." [...] Acknowledging that Anarky's moral perspective was guided by his own, Grant expressed that the conflict between Anarky and other heroes {{is a result of}} their political divisions: [...] "In my eyes, he's a hero, but to others, they see him as a villain. That is because most people might gripe about the political situation, or various aspects of the political situation, and wouldn't advocate the total overthrow of the system under which we live. Anarky <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> that, and more." ...|$|E
500|$|Positive {{comments}} {{came from}} functionalist architect Erich Mendelsohn in 1938, who wrote to Holden {{that he was}} [...] "very much taken and am convinced {{that there is no}} finer building in London." [...] Architectural historian Arnold Whittick described the building as a [...] "static massive pyramid ... obviously designed to last for a thousand years", but thought [...] "the interior is more pleasing than the exterior. There is essentially the atmosphere of dignity, serenity and repose that one associates with the architecture of ancient Greece." [...] Nikolaus Pevsner was less enthusiastic. He described its style as [...] "strangely semi-traditional, undecided modernism" [...] and summarised the result: [...] "The design <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> not possess the vigour and directness of Charles Holden's smaller Underground stations." [...] Others have described it as Stalinist or as totalitarian due to its great scale.|$|E
500|$|For the 2004–05 season, {{the team}} {{moved into the}} Atlantic Division and the Raptors decided to revamp the team. Raptors President and CEO of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Richard Peddie fired Grunwald on April 1, 2004, after the team ended the season three games short of the eighth and final playoff spot in the {{previous}} season. Head coach Kevin O'Neill and his four assistant coaches were also dismissed immediately after Grunwald's termination. Toronto interim manager Jack McCloskey said: [...] "While the blame for that <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> not rest on O'Neill and his staff alone, we need a change." [...] Rob Babcock was named General Manager on June 7, 2004, alongside the appointments of Wayne Embry as senior advisor and Alex English as director of player development.

500|$|Gabrielle Union, a {{rape victim}} {{and one of the}} main stars of The Birth of a Nation, wrote in the Los Angeles Times, [...] "As {{important}} and ground-breaking as this film is, I cannot take these allegations lightly. On that night, 17-odd years ago, did Nate have his date’s consent? It’s very possible he thought he did. Yet by his own admission he did not have verbal affirmation; and even if she never said “no,” silence <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> not equal “yes.” Although it’s often difficult to read and understand body language, the fact that some individuals interpret the absence of a “no” as a “yes” is problematic at least, criminal at worst." [...] Sources suggest that Parker and Celestin's accuser was either unconscious or extremely drunk when Parker invited Celestin to have sex with her (Parker was already actively engaged in a sex act with her at the time).|$|E
500|$|Senate House divided opinion.

500|$|Dawkins rose to {{prominence}} in public debates relating {{science and religion}} {{since the publication of}} his most popular book The God Delusion in 2006, which became an international best seller. As of 2015, more than three million copies were sold and the book has been translated into over 30 languages. Its success has been seen by many as indicative of a change in the contemporary cultural zeitgeist and has also been identified with the rise of New Atheism. In the book, Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> not exist and that religious faith is a delusion—"a fixed false belief". In his February 2002 TED talk entitled [...] "Militant atheism", Dawkins urged all atheists to openly state their position and to fight the incursion of the church into politics and science. On 30 September 2007, Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris, and Daniel Dennett met at Hitchens' residence for a private, unmoderated discussion that lasted two hours. The event was videotaped and titled [...] "The Four Horsemen".|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} was reintroduced during the 2004 series finale. The episode {{focused on a}} fire at the Lassiter's complex which destroys the local pub, hotel, doctor's surgery and coffee shop. Paul's arrival coincidences with the fire which makes him a suspect. His return forms the end of season cliff-hanger and Australian viewers had to wait months before Paul's return continued on-screen. Dennis told Jason Herbison from Inside Soap that [...] "judging from his first appearance he <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> look guilty." [...] He teased that Paul is [...] "very enigmatic" [...] and his motives for committing the crime remain unclear. Dennis professed his love for his character's mysterious agenda but noted that Paul had [...] "grown and matured" [...] during his absence. Producer Peter Dodds believed that Paul's return gave his writers numerous stories. He detailed that it allowed the return of other past characters and [...] "kick-started a whole new web of deceit and lies" [...] within the show. He concluded that it made Neighbours more dramatic ever since.|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{feature for}} [...] "Oathbreaker", showrunner Weiss stated of the Tower of Joy {{flashback}} that [...] "One {{of the best}} things about being able to go back with Bran and look at the past {{is to be able to}} see the discrepancy between the received history, the things that everybody knows about the things that happened, and what actually happened." [...] Benioff continued, [...] "Every kid that grows up in Westeros, they all hear about this legendary sword fight that took place twenty years ago, and as far as Bran knew, it was just his father beat this legendary guy." [...] Weiss also stated [...] "Honor was so important to Ned Stark that it was worth losing his own life for, but he was completely ready to let go of that honor and excellence to do something that he really felt was more important. It could make a very, very strong defense for Ned doing what he did, and it <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> puncture the mythology of Ned Stark that's running through this world, especially after his death." ...|$|E
500|$|Henry Brougham {{wrote of}} the public {{reaction}} to Charlotte's death, [...] "It really was as though every household throughout Great Britain had lost a favourite child." [...] The whole kingdom went into deep mourning; linen-drapers ran out of black cloth. [...] Even the poor and homeless tied armbands of black on their clothes. [...] The shops closed for two weeks, as did the Royal Exchange, the Law Courts, and the docks. [...] Even gambling dens shut down {{on the day of}} her funeral, as a mark of respect. [...] Wrote The Times, [...] "It <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> not belong to us to repine at the visitations of Providence... there is nothing impious in grieving for that as a calamity." [...] Mourning was so complete that the makers of ribbons and other fancy goods (which could not be worn during the period of mourning) petitioned the government to shorten the period, fearing they would otherwise go bankrupt. [...] A dissenting note was struck by poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, who in his An Address to the People on the Death of the Princess Charlotte, indicated that the execution of three men the day after the Princess's death for plotting to overthrow the government was a greater tragedy.|$|E

500|$|Homer is an [...] "everyman" [...] and embodies several American {{stereotypes}} of working class blue-collar men: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, dim witted, clumsy and a borderline alcoholic. Matt Groening describes him as [...] "completely ruled by his impulses". Dan Castellaneta calls him [...] "a dog {{trapped in a}} man's body", adding, [...] "He's incredibly loyal– not entirely clean– but you gotta love him." [...] In his book Planet Simpson, author Chris Turner describes Homer as [...] "the most American of the Simpsons" [...] and believes that while the other Simpson family members could be changed to other nationalities, Homer is [...] "pure American". In the book God in the Details: American Religion in Popular Culture, the authors comment that [...] "Homer's progress (or lack thereof) reveals a character who can do the right thing, if accidentally or begrudgingly." [...] The book [...] includes a chapter analyzing Homer's character {{from the perspective of}} Aristotelian virtue ethics. Raja Halwani writes that Homer's [...] "love of life" [...] is an admirable character trait, [...] "for many people are tempted to see in Homer nothing but buffoonery and immorality. [...] He is not politically correct, he is more than happy to judge others, and he <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> not seem to be obsessed with his health. These qualities might not make Homer an admirable person, but they do make him admirable in some ways, and, more importantly, makes us crave him and the Homer Simpsons of this world."

Priya Elan from NME said the song [...] "seems to soar effortlessly" [...] and that [...] "what Madonna's {{doing in this}} song {{is so much more}} impossibly fun than we could have imagined." [...] She also stated the song was a progress from the sound of her previous album, Hard Candy. Jim Farber from the New York Daily News considered that the song is [...] "a pure snap of bubble gum, closer to an early single like 'Burning Up' than any of her more recent club hits. Only the rap cameos from the quite camp Nicki Minaj, and the less so M.I.A., tell us what decade we're in." [...] Michael Cragg from The Guardian felt that the track was not bad. [...] "Musically it's a pretty joyful four minutes, featuring bouncing beats, acoustic riffs and Gwen Stefani-style cheerleader chants, but there's something a bit flat about Madonna's delivery. Given all the love she's demanding, you'd think she'd be more excited." [...] Speaking of the rap part, he thought that [...] "Minaj <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> her best, her typically frantic rap an exercise in squeezing as many words into a 10-second space as possible, while MIA's more laconic drawl loses momentum." [...] Chris Willman of Reuters called it [...] "risible" [...] and infectious: [...] "Everything here is as dumb as the titular spelling, but the campiness has its charm, at least if you like the old musicals that some of the tracking shots here are paying homage to". MTV News journalist Bradley Stern wrote about the [...] "Hey Mickey" [...] comparisons, complimenting the guest rapping of Minaj and M.I.A. even though he felt it was [...] "one of the album’s least compelling moments". In a review of MDNA, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph felt that the prime purpose of the [...] "lightest, frothiest track" [...] from the album was to represent next generation's female pop stars.
