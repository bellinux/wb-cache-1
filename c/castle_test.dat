50|$|Battle Castle is {{an action}} {{documentary}} TV series co-produced by Parallax Film Productions Inc. with London-based Ballista Media Inc. It explores the medieval arms race reflected in castle {{construction in the}} Middle Ages and, using location filming, re-enactments and CGI reconstruction, tells the stories of six <b>castles</b> <b>tested</b> by siege. Hosted by Dan Snow, the series has aired on History Television, SBS Australia and most recently, Discovery UK.|$|R

5000|$|The Mark 21 {{nuclear bomb}} was a United States nuclear gravity bomb first {{produced}} in 1955. It {{was based on}} the TX-21 [...] "Shrimp" [...] prototype that had been detonated during the <b>Castle</b> Bravo <b>test</b> in March 1954. While most of the Operation <b>Castle</b> <b>tests</b> were intended to evaluate weapons intended for immediate stockpile, or which were already available for use as part of the Emergency Capability Program, Castle Bravo was intended to test a design which would drastically reduce the size and costs of the first generation of air-droppable atomic weapons (the Mk 14, Mk 17 & Mk 24). At 12 ft long, 56 in in diameter, and weighing 15000 lb, the Mk-21 was half the length and one-third the weight of the Mk-17/24 weapons it replaced. Its minimum yield was specified at four megatons.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{size of the}} <b>Castle</b> Bravo <b>test</b> on 1 March 1954 far {{exceeded}} expectations, causing widespread radioactive contamination. The fallout spread traces of radioactive material as far as Australia, India and Japan, and even the United States and parts of Europe. Though organized as a secret <b>test,</b> <b>Castle</b> Bravo quickly became an international incident, prompting calls for {{a ban on the}} atmospheric testing of thermonuclear devices.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Castle</b> Yankee {{thermonuclear}} <b>test</b> was {{the first}} bomb to use enriched Lithium-6 isotope, up to perhaps 40% enrichment (the earlier <b>Castle</b> Bravo <b>test</b> had used the same enriched lithium combination but was not weaponised i.e. was not built as a deployable bomb). The device tested was called the Runt II design; it was reportedly {{very similar to the}} Runt design <b>tested</b> in <b>Castle</b> Romeo, other than the enrichment level.|$|R
50|$|In 1954 {{work began}} at Aldermaston {{to develop the}} British fusion bomb, with Sir William Penney {{in charge of the}} project. British {{knowledge}} on how to make a thermonuclear fusion bomb was rudimentary, and at the time the United States was not exchanging any nuclear knowledge because of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. However, the British were allowed to observe the American <b>Castle</b> <b>tests</b> and used sampling aircraft in the mushroom clouds, providing them with clear, direct evidence of the compression produced in the secondary stages by radiation implosion.|$|R
50|$|It was detonated on May 5, 1954, at Bikini Atoll of the Marshall Islands, on a barge moored in {{the middle}} of the crater from the <b>Castle</b> Union <b>test.</b>|$|R

50|$|Like the Ivy Mike, Castle Bravo, and <b>Castle</b> Romeo <b>tests,</b> a large {{percentage}} of the yield was produced by fast fission of the natural uranium tamper, which contributed to the extensive fallout caused by these tests.|$|R
40|$|Filter {{materials}} {{are required to}} be cohesionless. They ensure safety of embankment dams against fault movement. At present, {{from this point of}} view, we have the criterion that the percentage of the filters passing the # 200 sieve (0. 074 mm) should be less than 5 %. However we can use any soil for filters, if we can confirm their high permeability and non-cohesion. We have performed Sand <b>Castle</b> <b>tests</b> proposed by P. Vaughan in order to confirm non-cohesion of filter materials. In addition, we have discussed the method of relaxing restrictions on the percentage finer than the # 200 sieve of filter materials for embankment dams...|$|R

50|$|The EC24 {{bomb was}} a limited {{production}} run of the <b>Castle</b> Yankee <b>test</b> device, with 10 produced and stockpiled through 1954. The EC24 was 61 by 255 in and weighed 39600 lb. The EC24 was a purely free-fall bomb design.|$|R
50|$|War {{missions}} {{would have}} been one-way, taking off from forward bases in Alaska or Greenland, overflying the USSR, with survivors landing in Europe, North Africa (Morocco), or the Middle East. Recollections of crew veterans reveal that, while crews were confident {{of their ability to}} complete a mission, they were less confident of surviving the weapon delivery itself. Their concerns were about dropping extremely powerful bombs from a relatively slow-moving aircraft, leaving the aircraft within blast range. Their concerns were borne out during the 1954 Operation <b>Castle</b> <b>tests.</b> Here B-36s were flown at the combat distance from the detonations of bombs in the 15-megaton range. At distances believed typical of wartime delivery the aircraft suffered extensive flash and blast damage.|$|R

5000|$|The {{fact that}} a large {{proportion}} of the yield of a thermonuclear device stems from the fission of a uranium 238 tamper (fission-fusion-fission principle) was revealed when the <b>Castle</b> Bravo <b>test</b> [...] "ran away," [...] producing a much higher yield than originally estimated and creating large amounts of nuclear fallout.|$|R
