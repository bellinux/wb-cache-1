60|$|Thirdly, {{from the}} Experiment of <b>charring</b> <b>of</b> Coals (whereby {{we see that}} {{notwithstanding}} the great heat, and the duration of it, the solid parts of the Wood remain, whilest they are preserv'd from the free access of the air undissipated) we may learn, that which has not, that I know of, been publish'd or hinted, nay, {{not so much as}} thought of, by any; and that in short is this.|$|E
60|$|The {{reason of}} which {{difference}} may probably be, that the <b>charring</b> <b>of</b> Vegetables, being an operation quickly perform'd, and whilest the Wood is sappy, the more solid parts may more easily shrink together, and contract the pores or interstitia between them, {{then in the}} rotten Wood, where that natural juice seems onely to be wash'd away by adventitious or unnatural moisture; and so though the natural juice be wasted from between the firm parts, yet those parts are kept asunder by the adventitious moystures, and so by degrees settled in those postures.|$|E

60|$|To {{take another}} example: the more {{powerful}} acids corrode or blacken organic compounds. This {{is a case of}} causation, but of remote causation; and is said to be explained when it is shown that there is an intermediate link, namely, the separation of some of the chemical elements of the organic structure from the rest, and their entering into combination with the acid. The acid causes this separation of the elements, and the separation of the elements causes the disorganization, and often the <b>charring</b> <b>of</b> the structure. So, again, chlorine extracts coloring matters (whence its efficacy in bleaching) and purifies the air from infection. This law is resolved into the two following laws: Chlorine has a powerful affinity for bases of all kinds, particularly metallic bases and hydrogen: such bases are essential elements of coloring matters and contagious compounds, which substances, therefore, are decomposed and destroyed by chlorine.|$|E
60|$|Kunz himself rode on {{till the}} sun had risen, and he was within so few miles of his castle that the terror of his name {{was likely to be}} a {{sufficient}} protection. Himself and his horse were, however, spent by the wild midnight ride, and on the border of the wood of Eterlein, near the monastery of Grunheim, he halted, and finding the poor child grievously exhausted and feverish, he lifted him down, gave him water, and went himself in search of wood strawberries for his refreshment, leaving the two horses in the charge of Schweinitz. The servant dozed in his saddle, and meanwhile the charcoal-burner, George Schmidt, attracted by the sounds, came out of the wood, where all night he had been attending to the kiln, hollowed in the earth, and heaped with earth and roots of trees, where a continual <b>charring</b> <b>of</b> wood was going on. Little Albrecht no sooner saw this man than he sprang to him, and telling his name and rank, entreated to be rescued from these cruel men. The servant awaking, leapt down and struck a deadly blow at the boy's head with his pole-ax, but it was parried by the charcoal-burner, who interposing with one hand the strong wooden pole he used for stirring his kiln, dragged the little prince aside with the other, {{and at the same time}} set his great dog upon the servant. Sir Konrad at once hurried back, but the valiant charcoal- burner still held his ground, dangerous as the fight was between the peasant unarmed except for the long pole, and the fully accoutered knight of gigantic size and strength. However, a whistle from George soon brought a gang of his comrades to his aid, and Kunz, finding himself surrounded, tried to leap into his saddle, and break through the throng by weight of man and horse, but his spur became entangled, the horse ran away, and he was dragged along with his head on the ground till he was taken up by the peasants and carried to the convent of Grunheim, whence he was sent to Zwickau, and was thence transported heavily ironed to Freiburg, where he was beheaded on the 14th of July, only a week after his act of violence. The Elector, in his joy at the recovery of even one child, was generous enough to send a pardon, but the messenger reached Freiburg too late, and a stone in the marketplace still marks the place of doom, while the grim effigy of Sir Konrad's head grins over the door of the Rathhaus. It was a pity Friedrich's mildness did not extend to sparing torture as well as death to his treacherous scullion, but perhaps a servant's power of injuring his master was thought a reason for surrounding such instances of betrayal with special horrors.|$|E

FTIR results showed that absorption peaks of functional groups on the surface <b>of</b> <b>char</b> from catalytic pyrolysis at 700 T were more than that <b>of</b> <b>char</b> from noncatalytic pyrolysis. Raman results demonstrated values Of (I-D 3 + I-D 4) /I-G,I- <b>of</b> <b>chars</b> from catalytic pyrolysis and noncatalytic pyrolysis were 4. 76 and 3. 86, respectively, indicating that ordering <b>of</b> the <b>char</b> was decreased by Fe 2 O 3.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the use of TGA under different thermal decomposition conditions (nitrogen or air, and 5 or 40 ℃/min) to evaluate preservative-treated woods and their preservatives. It also analyzed the residual elements in the char using EDX. Two types of preservative-treated woods were investigated. One impregnated with CCA- 3 {{and the other one}} treated with ACQ- 1 using a full-cell treatment. The results of the TGA showed that the thermal properties of CCA- or ACQ-treated wood were similar to that of untreated wood in either a nitrogen or an air atmosphere, but the pyrolysis temperature for the heating rate of 5 ℃/min was lower than that of 40 ℃/min. Regardless of different atmosphere or heating rate, the <b>char</b> <b>of</b> the CCA specimens and the CCA- 3 was more than that of the ACQ ones and the ACQ- 1. The results of the EDX analysis of both preservative-treated woods show that the main element is C (CCA: 47. 96 %; ACQ: 50. 24 %), and that the relative proportion of C (CCA: 60. 42 %; ACQ: 77. 89 %) is higher after thermal decomposition. Cr from the <b>char</b> <b>of</b> CCA- 3 is a stable element, and the amount of Cr (34. 99 %) is obviously more than that of As (11. 89 %) and Cu (16. 69 %). The <b>char</b> <b>of</b> ACQ- 1 left a high amount of inorganic metal elements, such as Cu (50. 14 %). This suggests that by using EDX to analyze the residual elements in char, the results can provide experimental data for referencing the disposal-end practices (<b>char)</b> <b>of</b> both preservative-treated woods...|$|R
