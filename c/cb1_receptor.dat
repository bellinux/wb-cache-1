And preclinical studies have demonstrated the <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor</b> {{is required for the}} behavioral effects of noradrenergic based antidepressants but is dispensable for the behavioral effect of serotonergic based antidepressants.|$|E
25|$|Rimonabant, {{also known}} by the {{systematic}} name , is a 1,5-diarylpyrazole <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor</b> antagonist (Figure 2). Rimonabant {{is not only a}} potent and highly selective ligand of the <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor,</b> but it is also orally active and antagonizes most of the effects of cannabinoid agonists, such as THC, both in vitro and in vivo. Rimonabant has shown clear clinical efficacy for the treatment of obesity.|$|E
25|$|A review has now {{published}} on the approaches and compounds being pursued as peripherally restricted <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor</b> blockers.|$|E
25|$|<b>CB1</b> <b>receptors</b> are coupled through Gi/o {{proteins}} and inhibit adenylyl cyclase and activate mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. In addition, <b>CB1</b> <b>receptors</b> inhibit presynaptic N- and P/Q-type calcium channels and activate inwardly rectifying potassium channels. CB1 antagonists produce inverse cannabimimetic effects that are opposite in direction from those produced by agonists for these receptors.|$|R
50|$|In {{the central}} nervous system, <b>CB1</b> <b>receptors</b> {{influence}} neuronal excitability, reducing the incoming synaptic input.This mechanism, known as presynaptic inhibition, occurs when a postsynaptic neuron releases endocannabinoids in retrograde transmission, which then bind to cannabinoid receptors on the presynaptic terminal. <b>CB1</b> <b>receptors</b> then {{reduce the amount of}} neurotransmitter released, so that subsequent excitation in the presynaptic neuron results in diminished effects on the postsynaptic neuron. It is likely that presynaptic inhibition uses many of the same ion channel mechanisms listed above, although recent evidence has shown that <b>CB1</b> <b>receptors</b> can also regulate neurotransmitter release by a non-ion channel mechanism, i.e. through Gi/o-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase A.Direct effects of <b>CB1</b> <b>receptors</b> on membrane excitability have been reported, and strongly impact the firing of cortical neurons.A series of behavioral experiments demonstrated that NMDAR, an ionotropic glutamate receptor, and the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) work in concert with CB1 to induce analgesia in mice, although the mechanism underlying this effect is unclear.|$|R
50|$|Cannabinoid <b>receptor</b> type 1 (<b>CB1)</b> <b>receptors</b> {{are thought}} {{to be one of the}} most widely {{expressed}} Gαi protein-coupled receptors in the brain. This is due to endocannabinoid-mediated depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition, a very common form of retrograde signaling, in which the depolarization of a single neuron induces a reduction in GABA-mediated neurotransmission. Endocannabinoids released from the depolarized post-synaptic neuron bind to <b>CB1</b> <b>receptors</b> in the pre-synaptic neuron and cause a reduction in GABA release.|$|R

25|$|Another compound, the {{indazole}} derivative O-1248, can {{be regarded}} as an analog of rimonabant wherein its 5-aryl group is fused to the pyrazole moiety. However, this structural modification resulted in a 67-fold decrease in <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor</b> affinity.|$|E
25|$|Antibodies of the <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} and introduced into clinical use in Russia. They include brizantin (®) and dietressa (®).

50|$|When postsynaptic action {{potential}} firing occurs prior to presynaptic afferent firing, both presynaptic endocannabinoid (<b>CB1)</b> <b>receptors</b> and NMDA receptors are stimulated {{at the same}} time. Postsynaptic spiking alleviates the Mg2+ block on NMDA receptors. The postsynaptic depolarization will subside by the time an EPSP occurs, enabling Mg2+ to return to its inhibitory binding site. Thus, the influx of Ca2+ in the postsynaptic cell is reduced. <b>CB1</b> <b>receptors</b> detect postsynaptic activity levels via retrograde endocannabinoid release.|$|R
5000|$|<b>CB1</b> <b>receptors</b> {{are found}} {{primarily}} in the brain, more specifically in the basal ganglia and in the limbic system, including the hippocampus [...] and the striatum.

CB1 is also found in the human anterior eye and retina.|$|R
50|$|Hemopressin (Hp) is {{an alpha}} {{hemoglobin}} fragment with the sequence PVNFKFLSH, originally identified in extracts of rat brain using an enzyme capture technique. It binds cannabinoid receptors, acting as an inverse agonist at <b>CB1</b> <b>receptors.</b> Longer forms of hemopressin containing 2-3 additional amino acids on the N-terminus {{have been identified}} in extracts of mouse brain. These longer hemopressin peptides, named RVD-Hpα and VD-Hpα, bind to <b>CB1</b> <b>receptors</b> and are agonists. In addition to the Hp peptides from alpha hemoglobin, a related peptide from beta hemoglobin has been found in mouse brain extracts; this peptide, named VD-Hpβ, is also an agonist at <b>CB1</b> cannabinoid <b>receptors.</b>|$|R

25|$|Depolarization Induced Suppression Of Inhibition is the {{classical}} and original electrophysiological example of endocannabinoid {{function in the}} central nervous system. Prior to the demonstration that Depolarization Induced Suppression Of Inhibition was dependent on the cannabinoid <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor</b> function, {{there was no way}} of producing an in vitro endocannabinoid mediated effect.|$|E
25|$|Binding of an agonist ligand to the <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor</b> provokes a {{conformational}} change {{and leads to}} the active state of the receptor {{which is responsible for}} the signal transduction. However, there is an additional mechanism that can lead to the active state in the absence of ligand. As numerous other GPCRs, <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor</b> displays a high level of constitutive activity and thus it can spontaneously adopt an active conformational state in the absence of agonist binding, keeping elevated basal levels of intracellular signaling. This {{can be explained by the}} two state-model of receptor activation in which receptors are in equilibrium between two states, active and inactive (R* and R). An agonist will stabilize the active state leading to activation, a neutral antagonist binds equally to active and inactive states, whereas an inverse agonist will preferentially stabilize the inactive state (Figure 3).|$|E
50|$|RCS-4 is {{a potent}} {{cannabinoid}} receptor agonist, with EC50 values of 146 nM for human <b>CB1</b> <b>receptors,</b> and 46 nM for human CB2 receptors.

50|$|AM-694 (1-(5-fluoropentyl)-3-(2-iodobenzoyl)indole) is a {{drug that}} acts as a potent and {{selective}} agonist for the cannabinoid <b>receptor</b> <b>CB1.</b> It is used in scientific research for mapping the distribution of <b>CB1</b> <b>receptors.</b> No public data about AM-694 metabolism is known. AM-694 has already emerged as a designer drug.|$|R
25|$|Research {{has shown}} that the absence of the carboxamide oxygen results in {{decreased}} affinity. Furthermore, the presence of carboxamide oxygen contributes in conferring the inverse agonist properties, whereas analogs lacking this oxygen are found to be neutral antagonists. These results support the hypothesis that the carboxamide oxygen forms a hydrogen bond with Lys192 residue at the <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor.</b>|$|E
25|$|Optimal binding at the <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor</b> {{requires}} a para-substituted phenyl ring at the pyrazole 5-position. The 5-substituent of the pyrazole {{is involved in}} receptor recognition and antagonism. The para-substituent of the phenyl ring could be chlorine, bromine or iodine, {{but it has been}} shown that an alkyl chain could also be tolerated. Numbering of the central pyrazole ring is shown in Figure 2.|$|E
25|$|Several {{attempts}} have been made to increase the affinity of the diarylpyrazole derivatives by rigidifying the structure of rimonabant. In terms of the general pharmacophore model the units A, B and/or C are connected by additional bonds leading to rigid molecules. For example, the condensed polycyclic pyrazole NESS-0327 showed 5000 times more affinity for the <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor</b> than rimonabant. However, this compound possesses a poor central bioavailability.|$|E
50|$|<b>CB1</b> <b>receptors</b> are {{expressed}} most densely {{in the central}} nervous system and are largely responsible for mediating the effects of cannabinoid binding in the brain. Endocannabinoids released by a depolarized neuron bind to <b>CB1</b> <b>receptors</b> on pre-synaptic glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, resulting in a respective decrease in either glutamate or GABA release. Limiting glutamate release causes reduced excitation, while limiting GABA release suppresses inhibition, a common form of short-term plasticity in which the depolarization of a single neuron induces a reduction in GABA-mediated inhibition, in effect exciting the postsynaptic cell.|$|R

25|$|For centuries hashish and {{marijuana}} from the Indian hemp Cannabis sativa L. {{have been used}} for medicinal and recreational purposes. In 1840, Schlesinger S. was apparently the first investigator to obtain an active extract from the leaves and flowers of hemp. A few years later, in 1848, Decourtive E. described the preparation of an ethanol extract that on evaporation of the solvent gave a dark resin, which he named “cannabin”. In 1964 the main active constituent of C. sativa L., Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), was isolated and synthesized by Mechoulam's laboratory. Two types of cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, responsible for the effects of THC were discovered and cloned in the early 1990s. Once cannabinoid receptors had been discovered, it became important to establish whether their agonists occur naturally in the body. This search led to the discovery of the first endogenous cannabinoid (endocannabinoid), anandamide (arachidonoyl ethanolamide). Later on other endocannabinoids were found, for example 2-AG (2-arachidonoyl glycerol). These findings raised further questions about the pharmacological and physiological role of the cannabinoid system. This revived the research on cannabinoid receptor antagonists which were expected to help answer these questions. The use of the cannabinoid agonist, THC, in its many preparations to enhance appetite is a well known fact. This fact led to the logical extension that blocking of the cannabinoid receptors might be useful in decreasing appetite and food intake. It was then discovered that the blockage of the <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor</b> represented a new pharmacological target. The first specific <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor</b> antagonist / inverse agonist was rimonabant, discovered in 1994.|$|E
25|$|The endocannabinoid system {{appears to}} play a {{significant}} role in the mechanism of action of clinically effective and potential antidepressants and may serve as a target for drug design and discovery. The endocannabinoid-induced modulation of stress-related behaviors appears to be mediated, at least in part, through the regulation of the serotoninergic system, by which cannabinoid CB1 receptors modulate the excitability of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons. Data suggest that the endocannabinoid system in cortical and subcortical structures is differentially altered in an animal model of depression and that the effects of chronic, unpredictable stress (CUS) on <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor</b> binding site density are attenuated by antidepressant treatment while those on endocannabinoid content are not.|$|E
25|$|The <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor</b> {{is found}} {{primarily}} {{in the brain and}} mediates the psychological effects of THC. The CB2 receptor is most abundantly found on cells of the immune system. Cannabinoids act as immunomodulators at CB2 receptors, meaning they increase some immune responses and decrease others. For example, nonpsychotropic cannabinoids {{can be used as a}} very effective anti-inflammatory. The affinity of cannabinoids to bind to either receptor is about the same, with only a slight increase observed with the plant-derived compound CBD binding to CB2 receptors more frequently. Cannabinoids likely have a role in the brain’s control of movement and memory, as well as natural pain modulation. It is clear that cannabinoids can affect pain transmission and, specifically, that cannabinoids interact with the brain's endogenous opioid system and may affect dopamine transmission.|$|E
40|$|Pharmacological {{activation}} of cannabinoid <b>CB(1)</b> and CB(2) <b>receptors</b> is a therapeutic strategy to treat chronic and inflammatory pain. It was recently {{reported that a}} mixture of natural triterpenes α- and β-amyrin bound selectively to <b>CB(1)</b> <b>receptors</b> with a subnanomolar K(i) value (133 pM). Orally administered α/β-amyrin inhibited inflammatory and persistent neuropathic pain in mice through both <b>CB(1)</b> and CB(2) <b>receptors.</b> Here, we investigated effects of amyrins on the major components of the endocannabinoid system...|$|R
50|$|Psychoactive cannabinoids {{from the}} {{marijuana}} plant (phytocannabinoids), {{from the body}} (endocannabinoids), and from the research lab (synthetic cannabinoids) produce their discriminative stimulus effects by stimulation of <b>CB1</b> <b>receptors</b> in the brain.|$|R
5000|$|... 5F-ADBICA (also {{known as}} 5F-ADB-PICA) is an indole-based {{synthetic}} cannabinoid {{that is a}} potent agonist at <b>CB1</b> <b>receptors</b> and CB2 receptors with EC50 values of 0.77 nM and 1.2 nM respectively.|$|R
25|$|Unlike anandamide, {{formation}} of 2-AG is calcium-dependent and is {{mediated by the}} activities of phospholipase C (PLC) and diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL). 2-AG acts as a full agonist at the <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor.</b> At a concentration of 0.3nM, 2-AG induces a rapid, transient increase in intracellular free calcium in NG108-15 neuroblastoma X glioma cells through a CB1 receptor-dependent mechanism. 2-AG is hydrolyzed in vitro by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), and the uncharacterized serine hydrolase enzymes ABHD6 and ABHD12. The exact contribution {{of each of these}} enzymes to the termination of 2-AG signaling in vivo is unknown, though it is estimated that MAGL is responsible for ~85% of this activity in the brain. There have been identified transport proteins for 2-arachidonoylglycerol and anandamide. These include the heat shock proteins (Hsp70s) and fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs).|$|E
2500|$|Other {{lines of}} {{evidence}} support {{the role of}} the <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor</b> in depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition. [...] This receptor is distributed very widely throughout the brain, covering all areas where depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition has been observed (Herkenham et al. 1990). [...] The <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor</b> also appears to be expressed mainly on GABA-ergic pre-synaptic terminals, making it an excellent candidate for mediating depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (Matyas et al. 2006, Katona et al. 1999). [...] In 2005, other groups began to demonstrate the involvement of the <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor</b> in DSI in other regions of the brain (Jo et al. 2005, Bodor et al. 2005). [...] Lastly, depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition research was finally applied to mice that had the <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor</b> genetically [...] "knocked-out". [...] So far, these knock-out mice are not known to exhibit DSI in any regions of the brain, suggesting that the <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor</b> is the crucial mediator for DSI (Kreitzer & Regehr 2001a, Ohno-Shosaku et al. 2002).|$|E
2500|$|A {{cannabinoid}} receptor antagonist, also {{known simply as}} a cannabinoid antagonist or as an anticannabinoid, {{is a type of}} cannabinoidergic drug that binds to {{cannabinoid receptor}}s (CBR) and prevents their activation by endocannabinoids. They include antagonists, inverse agonists, and antibodies of CBRs. The discovery of the endocannabinoid system {{led to the development of}} <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor</b> antagonists. The first CBR antagonist, rimonabant, was described in 1994. Rimonabant blocks the <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor</b> selectively and has been shown to decrease food intake and regulate body-weight gain. The prevalence of obesity worldwide is increasing dramatically and has a great impact on public health. The lack of efficient and well-tolerated drugs to cure obesity has led to an increased interest [...] in research and development of CBR antagonists. Cannabidiol (CBD), a naturally occurring cannabinoid, is a non-competitive CB1/CB2 receptor antagonist. And Δ9-tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), a naturally occurring cannabinoid, modulate the effects of THC via direct blockade of cannabinoid CB1 receptors, thus behaving like first-generation <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor</b> inverse agonists, such as rimonabant. CBD is a very low-affinity CB1 ligand, that can nevertheless affect <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor</b> activity in vivo in an indirect manner, while THCV is a high-affinity <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor</b> ligand and potent antagonist in vitro and yet only occasionally produces effects in vivo resulting from <b>CB1</b> <b>receptor</b> antagonism. THCV has also high affinity for CB2 receptors and signals as a partial agonist, differing from both CBD and rimonabant.|$|E
