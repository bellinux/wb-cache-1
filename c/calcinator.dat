Similarly, the temperature of >850 oC in the <b>calcinator</b> strikes a balance between increased rate of calcination at higher temperatures and reduced rate of degradation of CaO sorbent at lower temperatures.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} a {{horizontal}} rotating solar <b>calcinator</b> is studied numerically using computational fluid dynamics. The specific solar reactor is a 10 kW model designed {{and used for}} efficiency studies. The numerical model {{is based on the}} solution of the Navier-Stokes equations for the gas flow, and on Lagrangean dynamics for the discrete particles. All necessary mathematical models were developed and incorporated into a computational fluid dynamics model with the influence of turbulence simulated by a two-equation (RNG k-epsilon) model. The efficiency of the reactor was calculated for different thermal inputs, feed rates, rotational speeds and particle diameters. The numerically computed degrees of calcination compared well with equivalent experimental results. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

The actuality of the design of resources and energy saving measures in the electrode production was stated. The experimental temperature dependence of carbon materials physical properties was proved. Technical solutions of current equipment modernization were found out. In particular, multistage technological process of filler production was minimized; pilot project of the furnace for direct graphitization of electrode products was developed. The furnace possesses enhanced technological parameters of the electrode production process. Physical, mathematical and numerical models of the thermoelectrical, mechanical, thermal and hydrodynamic state of technological processes in industrial equipment were also developed, particularly, in electric <b>calcinators,</b> baking furnaces and furnaces for direct and indirect heating, which are necessary for numerical analysis of technological and constructional parameters of modernized equipment.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} the anhydrous borax process in a fluidized bed <b>calcinator,</b> it is absolutely necessary to study the dehydration behaviour of borax pentahydrate. It {{was found that the}} basic feature of the dehydration of borax pentahydrate to anhydrous borax is concerned with the conditions employed. The bulk density and sodium borate content of the end product were determined to be a function of number of stages of temperature of the dehydration period in the fluidized bed. It was observed that bulk density also depends on the number of moles of water remaining in the borax pentahydrate structure. High purity, low density and powdered anhydrous borax up to 99. 9 % can be produced by multi-stage calcination. Therefore, anhydrous borax may be produced in a convenient fluidized bed system by multi-stage heating of borax pentahydrate.

40|$|C 2 CNT (Carbon dioxide to carbon nanotube) {{cement plants}} have been {{introduced}} and analyzed which provide a significant economic incentive to eliminate the massive CO 2 greenhouse gas emissions of current plants {{and serves as a}} template for carbon mitigation in other industrial manufacturing processes. Rather than regarding CO 2 as a costly pollutant, this is accomplished by treating CO 2 as a feedstock resource to generate valuable products (carbon nanotubes). The exhaust from partial and full oxy-fuel cement plant configurations are coupled to the inlet of a C 2 CNT chamber in which CO 2 is transformed by electrolysis in a molten carbonate electrolyte at a steel cathode and a nickel anode. In this high yield 4 e- per CO 2 process, the CO 2 is transformed into carbon nanotubes at the cathode, and pure oxygen at the anode that is looped back in improving the cement line energy efficiency and rate of production. A partial oxy-fuel process looping the pure oxygen back in through the plant <b>calcinator</b> has been compared to a full oxy-fuel process in which it is looped back in through the plant kiln. The second provides the advantage of easier retrofit, while the first maximizes efficiency by minimizing the volume of gas throughput (eliminating N 2 from air). An upper limit to the electrical cost to drive C 2 CNT electrolysis is USD 70 based on Texas wind power costs, but will be lower with fuel expenses when oxy-fuel plant energy improvements are taken account. The current value of a ton of carbon nanotubes is substantially in excess of a ton of cement. Hence a C 2 CNT cement plant consumes USD 50 of electricity, emits no CO 2, and produces USD 100 of cement and USD 60, 000 of carbon nanotubes per ton of CO 2 avoided. As the cement product ages, CO 2 is spontaneously absorbed. This is a powerful economic incentive, rather than economic cost, to mitigate climate change through a carbon negative process.

40|$|The {{cost of the}} CO 2 capture using carbonation-calcination cycles as a {{technological}} option of the CO 2 capture in post combustion {{is the sum of}} several terms: sorbent costs, capital costs related to the capture plant, the new operation and maintenance processes, the cost of the additional fuels necessary to compensate the penalty in the efficiency due to the capture, and the cost of the CO 2 compression. The required conditions for the sorbents are that they have to be either very goods or very cheap. The cost of the sorbent flow can’t be higher than 1 - 3 € per separated CO 2 ton. In the case of utilisation of CaCO 3 as a sorbent, it has been calculated that the cost per separated CO 2 ton is 2, 5 €. The problem of this sorbent is that its deactivation is quick, but this is compensated by its high abundance in the nature. Apart from this, it has to be into account other terms in order to obtain the global cost. It has supposed a generation plant of 360 MW with a fluidized bed reactor. It has been estimated that it can be reached a realistic capture up to 78 % in the carbonator using CaO as a sorbent, as well as a 100 % of the CO 2 generated in the <b>calcinator,</b> resulting capture rates of 85 % approximately. The assumptions for the operation and maintenance are that the carbonators require a molar relation Ca/C of 4 for an effective CO 2 capture, a 30 % of the fuel is burned in the calcinators and the rest in the combustor, the capacity of the CaO to capture CO 2 decreases with the number of cycles, the recuperation rate of CaO is 92, 5 %, the global efficiency of the plant is 40, 7 %, the fuel is petroleum coke or anthracite. Furthermore, taking also into account the capital costs and the compression of the CO 2, it has been calculated that the global cost is 15, 5 € for a life of 30 years of the plant. Therefore, a priori {{it seems to be a}} reasonable cost compared with the technological options of CO 2 capture that are in operation nowadays, specially those which use amine...|$|E
40|$|Sorption Enhanced Steam Methane Reforming (SE-SMR) {{is a novel}} way of {{reforming}} {{natural gas}} to high purity hydrogen gas with in-situ CO 2 capture {{by the introduction of}} a CO 2 sorbent. The process is carried out in two steps. In the first step, hydrogen is produced and CO 2 is absorbed by the sorbent. In the second step, the sorbent is exposed to high temperature heat and the CO 2 is released. For the reforming to run continuously, two bubbling fluidized beds(BFB), can be coupled, one working as a reformer and the other one as a regenerator of the CO 2 sorbent. The reformer works at a temperature around 500 ˚C and the regenerator at around 900 ˚C. Once the reactions in the reformer are being carried out the reformer works at a near autothermal state due to the exothermic reaction between CO 2 and the sorbent. The regenerator however needs to be continuously supplied with heat to maintain at least 900 ˚C and for the endothermic calcination reaction of the sorbent to be carried out. One of the ways of providing heat to the process is by internal heat exchanger tubes. The advantage of using heat exchanger tubes is that no extra gas is added to the gas already in the bed (used interchangeably with reactor), thus not disturbing the volumetric flow and gas composition of the bed. For sequestration purposes, if the gases within the bed are not disturbed by for example nitrogen, N 2, they will be easier to separate and sequester. An analytical calculation of the energy balance of a calcination reactor with horizontal heat transfer tubes was carried out, and the necessary effect was found to be 14. 02 kW, which equates to a heat exchanger with 96 tubes in 8 rows, taking up 26 cm height in the reactor. Transferring heat via exhaust gas through metal tubes does however not yield a high thermal efficiency. One way of improving the efficiency of the <b>calcinator</b> is burning fuel gas directly in the reactor. This will lead to a direct heat exchange between the exhaust gas and the sorbent. On the other hand will the direct burning with air as an oxidizer lead to high fractions of N 2 in the reactor. Considering that the gas in question in this work is biogas, the release of CO 2 from the combustion is technically carbon neutral. Calculations for the necessary heat exchanger surface area and combustion rate of methane for the in-reactor combustion alternative have been carried out analytically, and a model of the in-reactor combustion has been established. At first, a fully fluidized bed model with integrated methane combustion was planned. Due to limitations of the modeling program and conversations with experts on the scope of the work in relation to the time-frame of the thesis, which is more closely discussed in Appendix H, the problem was reduced to a fixed bed approximation with 9 ̆ 3 black box 9 ̆ 4 combustion of methane outside the reactor. A heat balance, dependent on the rate of calcination was applied in the finite element modeling program COMSOL Multiphysics, and the resulting temperatures in the reactor were examined {{on the basis of what}} kind of fuel gas was used. In the first case, upgraded biogas, or SNG(Sustainable Natural Gas) was used as fuel gas. SNG is 100...|$|E
