2500|$|The first Deutsche Mark coins {{were issued}} by the Bank deutscher Länder in 1948 and 1949. From 1950, the {{inscription}} Bundesrepublik Deutschland (Federal Republic of Germany) appeared on the coins. These coins were issued in denominations of 1, 2, 5, and 10 pfennigs. The 1- and 2-pfennig coins were struck in bronze <b>clad</b> <b>steel</b> (although during some years the 2 pf. was issued in solid bronze) while 5 and 10 pf. were brass <b>clad</b> <b>steel.</b> In 1950, cupronickel 50-pfennig and 1-mark coins were released, while a cupronickel 2 marks and a [...]625 silver 5 marks were released in 1951. Cupronickel replaced silver in the 5 marks in 1975. [...] The 2- and 5-mark coins have often been used for commemorative themes, though typically only the generic design for the 5 marks is intended for circulation. Commemorative silver 10-mark coins have also been issued which have periodically {{found their way into}} circulation. Unlike other European countries, Germany retained the use of the smallest coins (1 and 2 pfennigs) until adoption of the euro.|$|E

In <b>cladding</b> <b>steel</b> plate, <b>cladding</b> interface vanished {{and was replaced}} new recrystallized grains, and no interface defects or inclusions were detected. Z direction tensile testing indicated that tensile fracture occurred in basal materials, i. e. strength and contraction of cross area are those of basal materials. Furthermore, with decreasing vacuum level of electron beam welding, size and amount of interface inclusions would obviously increase...|$|R

50|$|In 1980, coins were {{introduced}} in denominations of 50 centavos, 1, 2½, 5, 10 and 20 meticais. The 50 centavos, 2½ and 5 meticais were minted in aluminium, with the 1 metical in brass and the 10 and 20 meticais in cupro-nickel. In 1986, aluminium 1, 10, 20 and 50 meticais {{were introduced}}. A new coinage issued in 1994 was composed of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 meticais, with the lower four denominations in brass <b>clad</b> <b>steel</b> and the higher denominations in nickel <b>clad</b> <b>steel.</b> 5000 meticais coins {{were introduced in}} 1998, followed by 10,000 meticais in 2003.|$|E
5000|$|In 1912, {{production}} of gold coins ceased, whilst {{production of}} the 5 bolívares ended in 1936. In 1965, nickel replaced silver in the 25 and 50 céntimos, with the same happening to the 1 and 2 bolívares in 1967. In 1971, cupro-nickel 10 céntimo coins were issued, the [...] céntimos having last been issued in 1958. A nickel 5 bolívares was introduced in 1973. <b>Clad</b> <b>steel</b> (first copper, then nickel and cupro-nickel) {{was used for the}} 5 céntimos from 1974. Nickel <b>clad</b> <b>steel</b> was introduced for all denominations from 25 céntimos up to 5 bolívares in 1989.|$|E

5000|$|The State Bank of Vietnam resumed issuing coins on December 17, 2003. [...] The new coins, minted by the Mint of Finland, were in {{denominations}} of 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 5,000 đồng {{in either}} nickel <b>clad</b> <b>steel</b> or brass <b>clad</b> <b>steel.</b> Prior to its reintroduction, Vietnamese consumers had to exchange banknotes for tokens with a clerk before purchasing goods from vending machines. This was also {{to help the}} state ease the cost of producing large quantities of small notes which tended to wear hard. Many residents expressed excitement at seeing coins reappear after many years, as well as concern for the limited usefulness of the 200 đồng coins due to ongoing inflationary pressures.

Although for over 100 years people had been suggesting various ways of uniting copper and steel, it was not until the period mentioned that Farmer and Milliken tried wrapping a strip of copper about a steel wire. American engineers in 1883 and again in the 1890s made attempts to produce a copper-steel wire, in one instance at least, by electro-plating copper on steel.|$|E
50|$|In 1925 Abram Huston's son-in-law, Robert Wolcott, {{took his}} place as {{president}} of the mill. During World War I the company lost money but returned into good fortune in 1929 with a net income of $876,563 on sales nearing $20.4 million. Wolcott pushed the company through the tough times of The Great Depression. Production rates fell from 446,774 tons to 165,731 tons. Wolcott made a lot of cost reductions, intensive sales, and additional services such as partial fabrications before shipment in attempt to save the company. In 1930 the clad plate, which includes permanent bonding of two or more different metals that protects against rust, corrosion and abrasion, was brought to the production line.
