40|$|Bayer liquor is the pricipal {{source for}} gallium production. India {{is a large}} {{aluminium}} producing country and thus has a vast potential to produce gallium {{to the tune of}} 10 to 12 TPA from its five alumina plants. Various options are available for obtaining gallium from plant to plant through one of the following technologies viz, amalgam metallurgy, <b>cementation</b> of gallium <b>with</b> <b>aluminium</b> or aluminium gallium alloys, solvent extraction and ion exchange resins. The merits and otherwise of the various technologies will be discussed with reference to thier feasibility of commercial scale adoption in Indian Alumina plants, and their impact on the economy of alumina production. The world scenario of gallium production and consumption will also be dealt with...|$|R
