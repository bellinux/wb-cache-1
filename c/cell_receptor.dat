5|$|The membrane-bound {{form of an}} {{antibody}} may {{be called}} a surface immunoglobulin (sIg) or a membrane immunoglobulin (mIg). It {{is part of the}} B <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> (BCR), which allows a B cell to detect when a specific antigen is present in the body and triggers B cell activation. The BCR is composed of surface-bound IgD or IgM antibodies and associated Ig-α and Ig-β heterodimers, which are capable of signal transduction. A typical human B cell will have 50,000 to 100,000 antibodies bound to its surface. Upon antigen binding, they cluster in large patches, which can exceed 1 micrometer in diameter, on lipid rafts that isolate the BCRs from most other cell signaling receptors.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of insulin at the University of Toronto in 1921 is {{considered among the}} most significant events {{in the history of}} medicine. The stem cell was discovered at the university in 1963, forming the basis for bone marrow transplantation and all subsequent research on adult and embryonic stem cells. This was the first of many findings at Toronto relating to stem cells, including the identification of pancreatic and retinal stem cells. The cancer stem cell was first identified in 1997 by Toronto researchers, who have since found stem cell associations in leukemia, brain tumors and colorectal cancer. Medical inventions developed at Toronto include the glycaemic index, the infant cereal Pablum, the use of protective hypothermia in open heart surgery and the first artificial cardiac pacemaker. The first successful single-lung transplant was performed at Toronto in 1981, followed by the first nerve transplant in 1988, and the first double-lung transplant in 1989. Researchers identified the maturation promoting factor that regulates cell division, and discovered the T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor,</b> which triggers responses of the immune system. The university is credited with isolating the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases. Between 1914 and 1972, the university operated the Connaught Medical Research Laboratories, now part of the pharmaceutical corporation Sanofi-Aventis. Among the research conducted at the laboratory was the development of gel electrophoresis.|$|E

40|$|T <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> {{are among}} the most {{specific}} biological structures found in nature and are therefore excellent candidates for the molecular targeting of antigen. It is becoming increasingly apparent that common sets of T <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> are frequently used in humans to combat pathogen and cancer derived threats. Given that many of these conserved T <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> have high affinity for their target ligands, there is potential to amass virtual banks of “off-the-shelf” receptors for use {{in a wide range of}} immunotherapeutic strategies. Additionally, such T <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> could become basic blueprints for artificial enhancement through mutagenesis, thereby creating an even better 3 -dimensional fit for their cognate targets. Indeed, preliminary approaches using both “natural” and “supernatural” T <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> have shown promise in treating autoimmunity and malignancy. This review will discuss these studies and other approaches through which T <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> can be exploited in immunodiagnostics, pathogen control and gene therapy...|$|R

25|$|Thymocytes which pass β-selection {{express a}} T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> which {{is capable of}} {{assembling}} on the surface.

The T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> requires CD8 as a coreceptor to bind to MHC class I, and CD4 as a coreceptor to bind MHC class II. At this stage thymocytes upregulate both CD4 and CD8, becoming double positive cells.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most genes, {{which have}} a stable {{sequence}} in each cell which expresses them, the T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> {{is made up of}} a series of alternative gene fragments. In order to create a functional T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor,</b> the double negative thymocytes use a series of DNA-interacting enzymes to clip the DNA and bring separate gene fragments together. The outcome of this process is that each T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> has a different sequence, due to different choice of gene fragments and the errors introduced during the cutting and joining process (see section on V(D)J recombination for more information on TCR rearrangement). The evolutionary advantage in having a large number of unique T cell receptors is that each T cell is capable of recognizing a different peptide, providing a defense against rapidly evolving pathogens.|$|E

25|$|TCR {{rearrangement}} {{occurs in}} two steps. First the TCRβ chain is rearranged at the DN3 stage of T cell development. The TCRβ chain is paired with the pre-Tα {{to generate the}} pre-TCR. The cellular disadvantage in the rearrangement process {{is that many of}} the combinations of the T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> gene fragments are non-functional. To eliminate thymocytes which have made a non-functional T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor,</b> only cells that have successfully rearranged the beta chain to produce a functional pre-TCR are allowed to develop beyond the DN3 stage. Cells that fail to produce a functional pre-TCR are eliminated by apoptosis. This process is referred to as the beta-selection checkpoint. Successful beta-selection requires that TCRβ is produced, TCRβ is capable of pairing with pre-Tα to generate the pre-TCR, and that the pre-TCR can interact on the cell surface with the TCR signalling proteins.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} T cells to {{recognize}} foreign antigens is {{mediated by the}} T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> (TCR), which is a surface protein able to recognize short protein sequences (peptides) that are presented on MHC.

25|$|Idiotype Cross-Reaction – Idiotypes are {{antigenic}} epitopes {{found in}} the antigen-binding portion (Fab) of the immunoglobulin molecule. Plotz and Oldstone presented evidence that autoimmunity can arise {{as a result of}} a cross-reaction between the idiotype on an antiviral antibody and a host <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> for the virus in question. In this case, the host-cell receptor is envisioned as an internal image of the virus, and the anti-idiotype antibodies can react with the host cells.|$|E
25|$|Retrotransposons are transposable {{elements}} which proliferate within eukaryotic genomes {{through a}} process involving reverse transcription. RNA-Seq can provide information about the transcription of endogenous retrotransposons that may influence the transcription of neighboring genes by various epigenetic mechanisms that lead to disease.

25|$|Common lymphoid {{precursor}} cells that {{migrate to the}} thymus become known as T-cell precursors (or thymocytes) and do not express a T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor.</b> Broadly speaking, the double negative (DN) stage is focused on producing a functional β-chain whereas the double positive (DP) stage is focused on producing a functional α-chain, ultimately producing a functional αβ T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor.</b> As the developing thymocyte progresses through the four DN stages (DN1, DN2, DN3, and DN4), the T cell expresses an invariant α-chain but rearranges the β-chain locus. If the rearranged β-chain successfully pairs with the invariant α-chain, signals are produced which cease rearrangement of the β-chain (and silence the alternate allele) and result in proliferation of the cell. Although these signals require this pre-TCR at the cell surface, they are independent of ligand binding to the pre-TCR. These thymocytes will then express both CD4 and CD8 and progresses to the double positive (DP) stage where selection of the α-chain takes place. If a rearranged β-chain {{does not lead to}} any signalling (e.g. {{as a result of an}} inability to pair with the invariant α-chain), the cell may die by neglect (lack of signalling).|$|E

25|$|Aberrant B cell receptor-mediated {{feedback}} – A {{feature of}} human autoimmune disease {{is that it}} is largely restricted to a small group of antigens, several of which have known signaling roles in the immune response (DNA, C1q, IgGFc, Ro, Con. A receptor, Peanut agglutinin receptor(PNAR)). This fact gave rise to the idea that spontaneous autoimmunity may result when the binding of antibody to certain antigens leads to aberrant signals being fed back to parent B cells through membrane bound ligands. These ligands include B <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> (for antigen), IgG Fc receptors, CD21, which binds complement C3d, Toll-like receptors 9 and 7 (which can bind DNA and nucleoproteins) and PNAR. More indirect aberrant activation of B cells can also be envisaged with autoantibodies to acetyl choline receptor (on thymic myoid cells) and hormone and hormone binding proteins. Together with the concept of T-cell-B-cell discordance this idea forms the basis of the hypothesis of self-perpetuating autoreactive B cells. Autoreactive B cells in spontaneous autoimmunity are seen as surviving because of subversion both of the T cell help pathway and of the feedback signal through B <b>cell</b> <b>receptor,</b> thereby overcoming the negative signals responsible for B cell self-tolerance without necessarily requiring loss of T cell self-tolerance.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unknown}} what role the {{relatively}} bulky extracellular region of CD45 plays during cell interactions, but CD45 has various isoforms that change in size {{depending on the}} Th cell's activation and maturation status. For example, CD45 shortens in length following Th activation (CD45RA+ to CD45RO+), but whether this change in length influences activation is unknown. It has been proposed that the larger CD45RA+ may decrease the accessibility of the T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> for the antigen-MHC molecule, thereby necessitating {{an increase in the}} affinity (and specificity) of the T cell for activation. Once the activation has occurred however, CD45 shortens, allowing easier interactions and activation as an effector T helper cell.|$|E
40|$|<b>Cell</b> surface <b>receptors</b> {{have been}} {{identified}} as the sites of disease infectivity in living organisms in a previous study. Drugs used for the treatment or cure of infections have to eliminate infections through attacking infective organisms at the <b>cell</b> surface <b>receptors</b> to which the infective organisms are attached. Problem statement: The present study examines a wide sample of living things to get more information on the relationship of one <b>cell</b> surface <b>receptor</b> to other <b>cell</b> surface <b>receptors</b> in the body of an organism. Approach: The arrangement of <b>cell</b> surface <b>receptors</b> on the external covering of a few samples of fruits, leaves, stems, dry wood of a plant; wall gecko and some parts of the human body, were examined and photographed. Transverse and/or Longitudinal sections of soursop fruit and sycamore fruit were also examined and photographed. The five different coverings of the fleshy part of a coconut were also photographed. The photographs were studied to note the relationship of disease infection attached to <b>cell</b> surface <b>receptors</b> on the external surface of an organ to disease infection on the innermost covering of the same organ. Results: The results of the study showed that all living things had ubiquitous distribution of <b>cell</b> surface <b>receptors</b> which are usually observable with the unaided eye as dots or spots on the external covering of an organ, tissue or cell. The dots or <b>receptor</b> sites of <b>cell</b> surface <b>receptors</b> in the study are arranged in lines which were perpendicular, oblique, transverse or arranged in any other lineal geometrical form. The lineally arranged <b>cell</b> surface <b>receptors</b> were noted to be connected by grooves, channels or pipes which joined other receptor channels or intersected with them. Smaller <b>cell</b> surface <b>receptor</b> channels emptied into bigger channels or continued as small sized channels that ran side by side in a connective tissue bundle. These connective tissue bundles that carried many independent small-sized <b>cell</b> surface <b>receptor</b> channels joined up to form larger bundles that ran the whole length of the organism. In this way, the <b>cell</b> surface <b>receptors</b> in a locality were interconnect through bigger receptor channel highways to <b>cell</b> surface <b>receptors</b> in other remote parts of the body. This arrangement was illustrated by the sycamore fruit and the soursop fruit. The results of the study also showed that <b>cell</b> surface <b>receptors</b> have functional zonal units with other <b>cell</b> surface <b>receptors</b> which were delimited by <b>cell</b> surface <b>receptor</b> channels. The zoning system of <b>cell</b> surface <b>receptors</b> meant that an infection or a drug treatment of an infection would affect all the <b>cell</b> surface <b>receptors</b> of the same functional unit to the same degree. The <b>cell</b> surface <b>receptor</b> site was raised up when a disease infection at the site was being attacked by a body defence substance of an exogenous drug. Some <b>cell</b> surface <b>receptors</b> were damaged or obliterated or damaged by disease. Examination of different layers of the coconut fruit coverings showed that <b>cell</b> surface <b>receptors</b> traverse all external and internal coverings of an organ or organism no matter the hardness of the covering. They also showed that a disease infection at the outer covering of an organ passes through any number of coverings of that organ to infect the inside of that organ. <b>Cell</b> surface <b>receptors</b> can be destroyed by disease and infective agents still use <b>cell</b> surface <b>receptors</b> to destroy the remains of an organism after the organic death of the organism. Conclusion: From {{the findings of this study}} the researcher concludes that <b>cell</b> surface <b>receptors</b> are ubiquitous in living plants and animals; are arranged lineally in receptor channels; have anatomical and physiologic functional units; have a smaller and a bigger reactive head; are the receptors of the main endogenous mediator of an organisms normal body functioning/bodys defence and are interconnected by a systematic network of receptor channels...|$|R

25|$|The double {{positive}} thymocytes undergo lineage commitment, maturing into a CD8+ T cell (recognising MHC class I) or a CD4+ T cell (recognising MHC class II). Lineage commitment {{occurs at}} the late stage of positive selection and works by downregulation of both CD4 and CD8 (reducing the signal from the T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor)</b> and then upregulation of CD4 only. Thymocytes that start receiving signal again are those that recognise MHC class II, and they become CD4+ T cells. Thymocytes that do not start receiving signal again are those that recognize MHC class I, and they downregulate CD4 and upregulate CD8, to become CD8+ T cells. Both of these thymocytes types are known as single positive thymocytes.|$|E
25|$|Once the IF/B12 {{complex is}} {{recognized}} by specialized ileal receptors, it is transported into the portal circulation.

Hereditary defects in production of the transcobalamins and their receptors may produce functional deficiencies in B12 and infantile megaloblastic anemia, and abnormal B12 related biochemistry, even in some cases with normal blood B12 levels. For the vitamin to serve inside cells, the TC-II/B12 complex must bind to a <b>cell</b> <b>receptor,</b> and be endocytosed. The transcobalamin-II is degraded within a lysosome, and free B12 is finally released into the cytoplasm, where it may be transformed into the proper coenzyme, by certain cellular enzymes (see above).|$|E
25|$|The key {{disadvantage}} in a gene rearrangement process for T cell receptors {{is that by}} random chance, some arrangements of gene fragments will create a T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> capable of binding self-peptides presented on MHC class I or MHC class II. If T cells bearing these T cell receptors were to enter the periphery, they {{would be capable of}} activating an immune response against self, resulting in autoimmunity. Negative selection is the process evolved to reduce this risk. During negative selection, all thymocytes with a high affinity for binding self peptides presented on MHC class I or class II are induced to upregulate BCL2L11, a protein which drives apoptosis. Cells which do not have a high affinity for self-antigens survive negative selection. At this stage, some cells are also selected to become regulatory T cells, usually cells which have an intermediate affinity for self-peptide.|$|E
