5|$|The {{game has}} been likened to both Tomb Raider and Metal Gear Solid {{due to the}} 3D {{platforming}} and stealth gameplay respectively. Players guide the forest inhabitants through 20 levels, during which they must infiltrate a series of suburban homes in order to steal a variety of items and destroy construction materials. The items needed to lure endangered animals to the forest must be collected from houses and carried back to the forest one at a time. Each level requires several trips to be completed. Security systems must be avoided or deactivated in order to progress through each level. Household members and their pets must also be avoided, distracted or stunned by a thrown object. For example, a phone card {{can be used to}} make a prank call to lure a householder away, <b>catnip</b> can be used to distract cats.|$|E
25|$|This {{relationship}} {{is not limited}} to humans. A number of animals consume different psychoactive plants, animals, berries and even fermented fruit, becoming intoxicated, such as cats after consuming <b>catnip.</b> Traditional legends of sacred plants often contain references to animals that introduced humankind to their use. Animals and psychoactive plants appear to have co-evolved, possibly explaining why these chemicals and their receptors exist within the nervous system.|$|E
25|$|A list {{of plants}} which cause {{abortion}} was provided in De viribus herbarum, an 11th-century herbal {{written in the}} form of a poem, the authorship of which is incorrectly attributed to Aemilius Macer. Among them were rue, Italian <b>catnip,</b> savory, sage, soapwort, cyperus, white and black hellebore, and pennyroyal. Physicians in the Islamic world during the medieval period documented the use of abortifacients, commenting on their effectiveness and prevalence.|$|E

25|$|An unusual {{feature of}} {{valerian}} is that valerian root and leaves are a cat attractant similar to, and as safe as, <b>catnip.</b> Valerian contains the cat attractant actinidine. Cat attractants might mimic {{the odor of}} cat urine, which is caused by 3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol. Anecdotal reports claim that valerian is also attractive to rats—so much so {{that it had been}} used to bait traps. Stories describe the Pied Piper of Hamelin using both his pipes and valerian to attract rats. Research also shows that valerian root is the strongest chemoattractant of slime molds such as Physarum polycephalum.|$|E
25|$|About 70% of {{domestic}} cats are especially attracted to, and {{affected by the}} plant Nepeta cataria, otherwise known as <b>catnip.</b> Wild cats, including tigers, are also affected, but with unknown percentage. The first reaction of cats is to sniff. Then, they lick and sometimes chew the plant and after that rub against it, with their cheeks and the whole body by rolling over. If cats consume concentrated extract of the plant, they quickly show signs of over-excitement such as violent twitching, profuse salivation and sexual arousal. The reaction {{is caused by the}} volatile terpenoids called nepetalactones present in the plant. Although they are mildly toxic and repel insects from the plant, their concentration is too low to poison cats.|$|E
500|$|The show {{is aimed}} at an adult audience, {{features}} [...] "neutering, incontinence, cannibalism and <b>catnip</b> overdoses" [...] and humour styles such as slapstick and farce. For example, the first episode begins with {{a scene in which}} Marion, portrayed as desperately trying to revive his deceased owner, learns she has actually been dead for four months, whereupon he casually gives his cat friends permission to eat her. Mongrels has attracted accusations of plagiarism, with claims that Mongrels stole ideas from a similar Channel 4 show called Pets.|$|E
5000|$|She then {{wrote her}} first Young Adult book, Bad Kitty, {{published}} in January 2006, {{and the following}} month, it was named Book of the Month in the Meg Cabot Book Club. The next year, she published Kiss and Tell which {{was included in the}} anthology Prom Nights from Hell. In 2008, she wrote Kitty Kitty, the sequel of Bad Kitty, and the same year was published its graphic novel, <b>Catnipped.</b> Her latest YA novel is [...] "Rosebush," [...] which was published on December 7, 2010.|$|R
500|$|Many {{remedies}} {{have been}} tried {{in the search for}} control of the major pest species of cockroaches, which are resilient and fast-breeding. Household chemicals like sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) have been suggested, without evidence for their effectiveness. Garden herbs including [...] bay, <b>catnip,</b> mint, cucumber, and garlic have been proposed as repellents. Poisoned bait containing hydramethylnon or fipronil, and boric acid powder is effective on adults. Baits with egg killers are also quite effective at reducing the cockroach population. Alternatively, insecticides containing deltamethrin or pyrethrin are very effective. In Singapore and Malaysia, taxi drivers use pandan leaves to repel cockroaches in their vehicles.|$|E
500|$|Cats have {{an acute}} sense of smell, {{due in part}} to their {{well-developed}} olfactory bulb and a large surface of olfactory mucosa, about [...] in area, which is about twice that of humans. Cats are sensitive to pheromones such as 3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol, which they use to communicate through urine spraying and marking with scent glands. Many cats also respond strongly to plants that contain nepetalactone, especially <b>catnip,</b> as they can detect that substance at less than one part per billion. [...] About 70–80% of cats are affected by nepetalactone. This response is also produced by other plants, such as silver vine (Actinidia polygama) and the herb valerian; it may be caused by the smell of these plants mimicking a pheromone and stimulating cats' social or sexual behaviors.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} style also rates highly; {{writing in}} The Guardian, Mark Lawson called the pilot [...] "glossier and more populist than Newman's earlier work". Wry reference {{is made to}} Deed and Jo's relationship, with Lawson writing that Deed [...] "is desperate to conduct his own forensic investigation of the body fluids of the attractive defence QC". Writing on the programme's accessibility to an audience, Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian calls it [...] "talkative in the way television plays used to be when they had something to say. But it is notable that, in a profession famous for obfuscation, Deed uses only the most pellucid English". Banks-Smith has also drawn attention to the masculine skew the programme has; [...] "Judge John Deed [...] is <b>catnip</b> to the ladies. These are [...] called Georgie, Charlie, Jo and—when Rita defies abbreviation—Coop".|$|E
2500|$|The {{television}} show [...] "Knights", {{shown in the}} third act of the film, is {{a reference to the}} crime-centered reality show Cops, with Puss's <b>catnip</b> substituting for marijuana and pepper mills substituting for pepper spray.|$|E
2500|$|Newborns {{were held}} upside down by {{their feet and}} lifted up and down to prevent 'livergrown' disorder. Some {{midwives}} believed that placing the child next to the mother under the quilt would force 'bold hives' out of the baby's body. Others recommended a little <b>catnip</b> or ground ivy tea, a drop or two of turpentine, or a spoonful of whiskey in order to [...] "hive" [...] the baby. A piece of cloth was tied around the newborn's waist for six week to protect the navel area which was thought to easily rupture due to its weakness. The newborn’s hair could not be cut {{during the first few}} weeks of life for fear of death before six months of age. If a child whose hair was cut too early did not die, it was feared that the child would become a thief later in life. If someone stepped over the child, this would stunt the newborn’s growth. The day of the week on which the child was born also said a lot about the child. Children born on a Tuesday were said to be unlucky.|$|E

60|$|Beaten off by such undreamed-of glooms and steeps, you now sadly retraced your steps, and, mayhap, went {{skirting}} the inferior sideway terraces of pastures; where the multiple and most sterile inodorous immortalness of the small, white flower furnished no aliment for the mild cow's meditative cud. But {{here and there}} you still might smell from far the sweet aromaticness of clumps of <b>catnip,</b> that dear farm-house herb. Soon you would see the modest verdure of the plant itself; and wheresoever you saw that sight, old foundation stones and rotting timbers of log-houses long extinct would also meet your eye; their desolation illy hid by the green solicitudes of the unemigrating herb. Most fitly named the catnip; since, like the unrunagate cat, though all that's human forsake the place, that plant will long abide, long bask and bloom on the abandoned hearth. Illy hid; for every spring the amaranthine and celestial flower gained on the mortal household herb; for every autumn the <b>catnip</b> died, but never an autumn made the amaranth to wane. The <b>catnip</b> and the amaranth!--man's earthly household peace, and the ever-encroaching appetite for God.|$|E

60|$|Away trotted Prue, {{but in her}} haste she got <b>catnip</b> and wormwood, for the garret was darkish, and Prue's little {{nose was}} so full of the smell of the onions she had been peeling, that {{everything}} smelt of them.

[...] He referred to castoreum, a liquid obtained from the beaver, or castor, itself and having a powerful odor which acts on the animal just as <b>catnip</b> acts on a cat.|$|E
60|$|Nan {{went in for}} herbs, and had a fine {{display of}} useful plants, which she tended with {{steadily}} increasing interest and care. Very busy was she in September cutting, drying, and tying up her sweet harvest, and writing down in a little book how the different herbs are to be used. She had tried several experiments, and made several mistakes; so she wished to be particular lest she should give little Huz another fit by administering wormwood instead of <b>catnip.</b>|$|E
60|$|It did live. The little life, so frail, so {{unprofitable}} {{in every}} mere material view, so precious {{in the eyes}} of love, expanded and flowered at last into fair childhood. Not without much watching and weariness. Many a night the old fisherman walked the floor with the little thing in his arms, talking to it that jargon of tender nonsense which fairies bring as love-gifts to all who tend a cradle. Many a day the good little old grandmother called the aid of gossips about her, trying various experiments of <b>catnip,</b> and sweet fern, and bayberry, and other teas of rustic reputation for baby frailties.|$|E

The skeleton would pile his plate high with turkey bones from one side, and the fat lady would heap it up, whenever she could find a chance, with all sorts of food from the other, until Toby pushed back his chair, his appetite completely satisfied, if it never had been so before.|$|E

60|$|The pellet was administered, {{and such}} awful agonies {{immediately}} set {{in that the}} distracted mamma bade a sympathetic neighbour run for Mother Know-all. The neighbour ran, and in came a brisk little old lady in cap and specs, with a bundle of herbs under her arm, which she at once applied {{in all sorts of}} funny ways, explaining their virtues as she clapped a plantain poultice here, put a pounded <b>catnip</b> plaster there, or tied a couple of mullein leaves round the sufferer's throat. Instant relief ensued, the dying child sat up and demanded baked beans. The grateful parent offered fifty dollars; but Mother Know-all indignantly refused it and went smiling away, declaring that a neighbourly turn needed no reward, and a doctor's fee was all a humbug.|$|E

60|$|Ceres {{scarcely}} {{waited to}} hear what the nymphs had to say, before she hurried off to make inquiries all through the neighborhood. But nobody told her anything that could enable the poor mother to guess what had become of Proserpina. A fisherman, it is true, had noticed her little footprints in the sand, as he went homeward along the beach with a basket of fish; a rustic had seen the child stooping to gather flowers; several persons had heard either the rattling of chariot-wheels, or the rumbling of distant thunder; and one old woman, while plucking vervain and <b>catnip,</b> had heard a scream, but supposed it to be some childish nonsense, and therefore did not take the trouble to look up. The stupid people! It took them such a tedious while to tell the nothing that they knew, that it was dark night before Mother Ceres found out that she must seek her daughter elsewhere. So she lighted a torch, and set forth resolving never to come back until Proserpina was discovered.|$|E
60|$|Tony had {{not been}} idle while his {{mistress}} was away, and he showed her the hospital garden he had made close by, in which were cabbage, nettle, and mignonette plants for the butterflies, flowering herbs for the bees, chick-weed and hemp for the birds, <b>catnip</b> for the pussies, and plenty of room left for whatever other patients might need. In the afternoon, while Nelly did her task at lint-picking, talking busily to Will as she worked, and interesting him in her affairs, Tony cleared a pretty spot in the grove for the burying-ground, and made ready some small bits of slate on which to write {{the names of those}} who died. He did not have it ready an hour too soon, for at sunset two little graves were needed, and Nurse Nelly shed tender tears for her first losses as she laid the motherless mice in one smooth hollow, and the gray-coated rebel in the other. She had learned to care for him already, and when she found him dead, was very glad she had been kind to him, hoping that he knew it, and died happier in her hospital than all alone in the shadowy wood.|$|E
6000|$|Every {{thing in}} Uncle Abel's house {{was in the}} same time, place, manner, and form, from year's end to year's end. There was old Master Bose, a dog after my uncle's own heart, who always walked as if he was {{studying}} the multiplication table. There was the old clock, forever ticking in the kitchen corner, with a picture on its face of the sun, forever setting behind a perpendicular row of poplar trees. There was the never-failing supply of red peppers and onions hanging over the chimney. There, too, were the yearly hollyhocks and morning-glories blooming about the windows. There was the [...] "best room," [...] with its sanded floor, the cupboard in one corner with its glass doors, the ever green asparagus bushes in the chimney, and there was the stand with the Bible and almanac on it in another corner. There, too, was Aunt Betsey, who never looked any older, because she always looked as old as she could; who always dried her <b>catnip</b> and wormwood the last of September, and began to clean house the first of May. In short, this was the land of continuance. Old Time never took it into his head to practise either addition, or subtraction, or multiplication on its sum total.|$|E

I have the sympathetic manner, and they come to me to be cheered up. If a fellow's in love, he makes a bee-line for me, and tells me all about it. If anyone has had a bereavement, I am the rock on which he leans for support. Well, I'm a patient sort of man, and, as far as Bridley-in-the-Wold is concerned, I am willing to play the part. But a strong man does need an occasional holiday, and I made up my mind that I would get it. Directly I got here I saw that the same old game was going to start. Spencer Clay swooped down on me at once. I'm as big a draw with the Spencer Clay type of maudlin idiot as <b>catnip</b> is with a cat.

6000|$|As spring came on, {{a new set}} of amusements {{became the}} fashion, and the {{lengthening}} days gave long afternoons for work and play of all sorts. The garden had to be put in order, and each sister had a quarter of the little plot to do what she liked with. Hannah used to say, [...] "I'd know which each of them gardings belonged to, ef I see 'em in Chiny," [...] and so she might, for the girls' tastes differed as much as their characters. Meg's had roses and heliotrope, myrtle, and a little orange tree in it. Jo's bed was never alike two seasons, for she was always trying experiments. This year {{it was to be a}} plantation of sun flowers, the seeds of which cheerful land aspiring plant were to feed Aunt Cockle-top and her family of chicks. Beth had old-fashioned fragrant flowers in her garden, sweet peas and mignonette, larkspur, pinks, pansies, and southernwood, with chickweed for the birds and <b>catnip</b> for the pussies. Amy had a bower in hers, rather small and earwiggy, but very pretty to look at, with honeysuckle and morning-glories hanging their colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over it, tall white lilies, delicate ferns, and as many brilliant, picturesque plants as would consent to blossom there.|$|E

6000|$|In this Billerica solid {{men must}} have lived, select {{from year to}} year; a series of town clerks, at least; and there are old records that you may search. Some spring the white man came, built him a house, and made a {{clearing}} here, letting in the sun, dried up a farm, piled up the old gray stones in fences, cut down the pines around his dwelling, planted orchard seeds brought from the old country, and persuaded the civil apple-tree to blossom next to the wild pine and the juniper, shedding its perfume in the wilderness. Their old stocks still remain. He culled the graceful elm from out the woods and from the river-side, and so refined and smoothed his village plot. He rudely bridged the stream, and drove his team afield into the river meadows, cut the wild grass, and laid bare the homes of beaver, otter, muskrat, and with the whetting of his scythe scared off the deer and bear. He set up a mill, and fields of English grain sprang in the virgin soil. And with his grain he scattered {{the seeds of the}} dandelion and the wild trefoil over the meadows, mingling his English flowers with the wild native ones. The bristling burdock, the sweet-scented <b>catnip,</b> and the humble yarrow planted themselves along his woodland road, they too seeking [...] "freedom to worship God" [...] in their way. And thus he plants a town. The white man's mullein soon reigned in Indian cornfields, and sweet-scented English grasses clothed the new soil. Where, then, could the Red Man set his foot? The honey-bee hummed through the Massachusetts woods, and sipped the wild-flowers round the Indian's wigwam, perchance unnoticed, when, with prophetic warning, it stung the Red child's hand, forerunner of that industrious tribe that was to come and pluck the wild-flower of his race up by the root.|$|E
6000|$|The peculiarly brisk {{sensation}} of this morning, {{to which we}} have more than once alluded, enabled the Doctor to toil pretty vigorously at his medicinal herbs,--his <b>catnip,</b> his vervain, and the like; but he did not turn his attention to the row of mystic plants, with which so much of trouble and sorrow either was, or appeared to be, connected. In truth, his old soul was sick of them, and their very fragrance, which the warm sunshine made strongly perceptible, was odious to his nostrils. But the spicy, homelike scent of his other herbs, the English simples, was grateful to him, and so was the earth-smell, as he turned up the soil about their roots, and eagerly snuffed it in. Little Pansie, on the other hand, perhaps scandalized at great-grandpapa's neglect of the prettiest plants in his garden, resolved to do her small utmost towards balancing his injustice; so with an old shingle, fallen from the roof, which she had appropriated as her agricultural tool, she began to dig about them, pulling up the weeds, as she saw grandpapa doing. The kitten, too, with a look of elfish sagacity, lent her assistance, plying her paws with vast haste and efficiency at the roots of one of the shrubs. This particular one was much smaller than the rest, perhaps because it was a native of the torrid zone, and required greater care than the others to make it flourish; so that, shrivelled, cankered, and scarcely showing a green leaf, both Pansie and the kitten probably mistook it for a weed. After their joint efforts had made a pretty big trench about it, the little girl seized the shrub with both hands, bestriding it with her plump little legs, and giving so vigorous a pull, that, long accustomed to be transplanted annually, it came up by the roots, and little Pansie came down in a sitting posture, making a broad impress on the soft earth. [...] "See, see, Doctor!" [...] cries Pansie, comically enough giving him his title of courtesy,--"look, grandpapa, the big, naughty weed!" ...|$|E
