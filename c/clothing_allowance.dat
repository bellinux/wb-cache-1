He does not own {{a car or}} television; he gets his news from {{the people around him}} and gets around on a bicycle that he found, broken, {{on the side of the}} road. Though he has an open-door policy for people that come to visit him, he himself visits family only twice a year. He does have a computer, which he uses to keep in touch with other hermits via email. To earn his food and <b>clothing</b> <b>allowance,</b> which amounts to less than $5,500 per year, Withers makes pottery to sell and works one day a week for a scientific-instrument company.

25|$|The paid firemen had no days off, {{were not}} allowed to leave their post except for one meal, and were seldom allowed to leave the firehouse unless on fire {{business}} or a family emergency. An ordinance in 1859 made it illegal to give firemen alcoholic beverages. Their clothes were irregular; uniforms were not worn until 1874, with a regulation uniform established in 1928. Firemen had to buy their own uniforms until 1943, when a $60 <b>clothing</b> <b>allowance</b> was established. An attempt to remove politics from the fire department was not very successful; it was necessary to mandate that the department staff be half Republican and half Democrat, and the role of fire chief was based on political affiliation and family contacts.|$|E

Until 1979, the Queen made two distributions of money in leather purses to each recipient. [...] The first distribution, given to women in green purses and to men in white, was of an allowance {{in lieu of the}} clothing formerly given. [...] The white purses used for the <b>clothing</b> <b>allowance</b> may be distinguished from the white purses which contained Maundy money, as the former was tied with a short green string; the latter bears a long red string. [...] The <b>clothing</b> <b>allowance</b> purses had been introduced in 1936; prior to that, the <b>clothing</b> <b>allowance</b> was distributed in a paper packet. [...] In the second distribution two purses were given by the monarch; the red one contained £1.50 for provisions, once given in kind, and the additional sum of £1 mandated by Elizabeth I. [...] The white purses contained the Maundy money. [...] After 1979, the separate distribution of the <b>clothing</b> <b>allowance</b> was discontinued—the gifts have now been consolidated, and recipients now receive two purses in a single distribution, one white containing the Maundy coins, and one red containing the other money. [...] The distributions were consolidated so as to reduce the physical strain of the ceremony on the Queen as she aged. [...] The red purse contains £1 representing the money for redemption of the monarch's gown, £3 in lieu of the clothing once given, and £1.50 in place of the food once presented, totalling £5.50. [...] In 2015, for the ceremony at Sheffield Cathedral, the £5.50 not given in Maundy money took the form of a £5 coin commemorating the 50th anniversary of the death of Sir Winston Churchill and a 50p piece for the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain.|$|E

The vast majority of slaves transported across the Atlantic Ocean were sent to the Caribbean sugar colonies, Brazil, or Spanish America. Throughout the Americas, but especially in the Caribbean, tropical disease took a large toll on their population and required large numbers of replacements. Many Africans had a limited natural immunity to yellow fever and malaria; but malnutrition, poor housing, inadequate <b>clothing</b> <b>allowances,</b> and overwork contributed to a high mortality rate.|$|R

500|$|George {{had been}} raised under strict conditions, which he had rebelled against. [...] Despite this, he {{attempted}} to put his daughter, who had {{the appearance of a}} grown woman at age 15, under even stricter conditions. [...] He gave her a <b>clothing</b> <b>allowance</b> insufficient for an adult princess, and insisted that if she attended the opera, she was to sit {{in the rear of the}} box and leave before the end. [...] With the Prince Regent busy with affairs of state, Charlotte was required to spend most of her time at Windsor with her maiden aunts. [...] Bored, she soon became infatuated with her first cousin, George FitzClarence, illegitimate son of the Duke of Clarence. [...] FitzClarence was, shortly thereafter, called to Brighton to join his regiment, and Charlotte's gaze fell on Lieutenant Charles Hesse of the Light Dragoons, reputedly the illegitimate son of Charlotte's uncle, Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. [...] Hesse and Charlotte had a number of clandestine meetings. [...] Lady de Clifford feared the Prince Regent's rage should they be found out, but Princess Caroline was delighted by her daughter's passion. She did everything that she could to encourage the relationship, even allowing them time alone in a room in her apartments. [...] These meetings ended when Hesse left to join the British forces in Spain. Most of the Royal Family, except the Prince Regent, were aware of these meetings, but did nothing to interfere, disapproving of the way George was treating his daughter.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century women air pilots and other working women often wore trousers. Frequent {{photographs}} from the 1930s of actresses Marlene Dietrich and Katharine Hepburn in trousers helped make trousers acceptable for women. During World War II, women working in factories and doing other forms of [...] "men's work" [...] on war service wore trousers when the work demanded it. In the post-war era, trousers became acceptable casual wear for gardening, the beach, and other leisurely pursuits. Further, in Britain during World War II, because of the rationing of clothing, many women took to wearing their husbands' civilian clothes, including their trousers, to work while their husbands were away from home serving in the armed forces. This was partly because they were seen as practical workwear and partly to allow women to keep their <b>clothing</b> <b>allowance</b> for other uses. As this practice of wearing trousers became more widespread and as the men's clothing wore out, replacements were needed. By the summer of 1944, {{it was reported that}} sales of women's trousers were five times more than they had been in the previous year.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{buildings}} on Lewes Road {{were the first}} six of what later became the Percy and Wagner Almshouses.

[...] Their friend Margaret Marriot paid for the houses, which were intended for [...] "six poor widows {{who were members of}} the Church of England within the parish of Brighton" [...] (i.e. the area served by St Nicholas' Church) and who did not receive poor relief. [...] The endowment provided by Marriot provided an income which was used to buy clothes for each resident. [...] Brighton department store Hanningtons supplied each widow with two gowns valued between 12 and 15 shillings, a duffel cloak [...] "not to exceed in value 21 shillings nor less than 18 shillings" [...] in alternate years, and a black bonnet once every three years to a maximum value of 10 shillings. [...] Any remaining money was divided equally between the residents on a quarterly basis. [...] This amounted to about £48 per year at first between the six residents, but the endowment was later increased to £96 when the six additional houses were built.

50|$|As the war progressed {{rationing}} {{was extended}} to other commodities such as clothing. Clothing was rationed on a points system. When it was introduced, on 1 June 1941, no clothing coupons had been issued, and at first the unused margarine coupons in ration books were valid for <b>clothing.</b> Initially the <b>allowance</b> was for approximately one new outfit per year; as the war progressed the points were reduced until buying a coat used almost a year's clothing coupons. On 1 July 1942 the basic civilian petrol ration was abolished; this was announced on 13 March 1942. (Ivor Novello was a British public figure {{sent to prison for}} four weeks for misusing petrol coupons.) After that, vehicle fuel was only available to official users, such as the emergency services, bus companies and farmers. The priority users of fuel were always, of course, the armed forces.

6000|$|Hill {{was the son}} of a Landport cobbler, and {{had been}} hooked by a chance blue paper the {{authorities}} had thrown out to the Landport Technical College. He kept himself in London on his allowance of a guinea a week, and found that, with proper care, this also covered his <b>clothing</b> <b>allowance,</b> an occasional waterproof collar, that is; and ink and needles and cotton, and such-like necessaries for a man about town. This was his first year and his first session, but the brown old man in Landport had already got himself detested in many public-houses by boasting of his son, [...] "the Professor." [...] Hill was a vigorous youngster, with a serene contempt for the clergy of all denominations, and a fine ambition to reconstruct the world. He regarded his scholarship as a brilliant opportunity. He had begun to read at seven, and had read steadily whatever came in his way, good or bad, since then. His worldly experience had been limited to the island of Portsea, and acquired chiefly in the wholesale boot factory in which he had worked by day, after passing the seventh standard of the Board school. He had a considerable gift of speech, as the College Debating Society, which met amidst the crushing machines and mine models in the metallurgical theatre downstairs, already recognised--recognised by a violent battering of desks whenever he rose. And he was just at that fine emotional age when life opens at the end of a narrow pass like a broad valley at one's feet, full of the promise of wonderful discoveries and tremendous achievements. And his own limitations, save that he knew that he knew neither Latin nor French, were all unknown to him.|$|E
5000|$|Caswell {{came under}} fire from Michigan Public Radio [...] for a 2011 {{proposal}} to issue the Michigan state $80 <b>clothing</b> <b>allowance</b> for children that receive state welfare assistance [...] as an $80 gift card redeemable at secondhand clothing stores, such as Goodwill and Salvation Army, rather than just adding another $80 credit to the Bridge Card account that would be untraceable in how it was actually spent.

40|$|The {{involuntary}} {{immigration of}} African slaves to America {{in the early}} nineteenth century had a secondary impact on the slaves as well as slaveholders related to the possession and use of clothing and textiles in daily life. The slaves were not allowed to bring their clothing, or other attributions of their native culture to America. Rather, the slaveholders were required by law to provide for their slaves 2 ̆ 7 adequate 2 ̆ 2 clothing and basic needs. 2 ̆ 2 These requisitions were influenced by the slaveowner 2 ̆ 7 s philosophy of slave management, wealth, and temperament. Dependency for these basic necessities of life on the slaveowner reinforced the dichotomy of power in the slave system and the allocations of these goods were ritualized to dramatize this aspect of the established economic and social order. Recently published women 2 ̆ 7 s diaries and letters of the nineteenth-century South contain numerous references to the <b>clothing</b> and textile <b>allowances</b> or provisions made seasonally to each slave on the plantation in the antebellum South. Detailed descriptions and enumeration of the type and amount of these allotments are well chronicled as well as the writers 2 ̆ 7 evaluations of their suitability and, at times, scarcity. Acquisition or production supervision and record keeping related to textile provision procurements for the extended plantation population were major responsibilities for these women. The importance of this function and officiousness of the textile presentations belies these simple textiles as a symbol of economic and social power. This study focuses primarily on references to textile presentations and allotments found in the published diaries of three prominent women in the early 19 th century South Floride Clemson; Mary Chesnut; and Frances Ann Kemble. The rural fiefdom of a rice, cane, or cotton plantation drew its order from the economic purpose of the unit. The paternalistic society, well protected by the legal system, channeled land, wealth and power through the elitist white family structure. The black slave population was the means of production; acquired, maintained, and evaluated as they increased crop output. Paramount in all decision making concerns was preservation of the slaves as productive units. Hiring immigrant workers was a common practice for especially hard and/or dangerous work. An overseer noted: 2 ̆ 2 It was much cheaper to have Irish do it, who cost nothing to the plantation if they died, than to tie up good field-hands in such severe employment 2 ̆ 2 (Campbell, E. D. C., 1991 : 41). The distribution of clothing and textile supplies to the slaves was a matter of plantation policy, strictly supervised by the plantation mistress, and usually was accompanied by a formal presentation. The allotments were typically bi-annual, a summer and winter supply...|$|R
