40|$|Summary. There {{are three}} basic {{equations}} in mechanics for treating collisions: {{the law of}} impact, kine-matic <b>compatibility,</b> <b>and</b> energetic <b>consistency.</b> In this paper, the conditions are examined under which {{a natural extension of}} the dynamics at an impact is possible without taking additional impact laws, and which additional assumptions have to be made to solve the impact for different classes of systems. It will be shown that Newton’s law of impact for two colliding point masses can be derived from the concept of energy conservation and the principle of maximum dissipation, and has therefore not to be regarded as an independent equation. Moreover, it can be assigned to single-contact impacts in multibody systems as soon as the classical definition of perfect constraints is being extended to impulsive dynamics and uni-lateral contacts. It will further be shown that the principle of maximum dissipation leads to a unique post-impact velocity in the case of multi-contact collisions. In all other cases, however, the velocities remain undetermined, and laws of impact have to be postulated as additional and independent equations, whereas the classic definition of the restitution coefficient as a dissipation parameter can still be kept. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationships between}} the dynamics of political support for the Soviet regime, as revealed in party membership, and economic policy. Soviet regime is considered as the rule of the bureaucracy that captures rents through collective control over state property and job assignment. Theoretical model focuses on the equilibrium in the “political labor market”, where the ruling bureaucracy acquires services and political support of activists in exchange for deferred promotion into rent-paying positions. This exchange is facilitated by the implicit contract between the party bureaucracy and activists (party candidates). The major implication of the model is that the stability of a Soviet-type one-party regime is consistent with high income inequality and strengthened when the ruling bureaucracy pursues active investment policy. The model also reveals conditions under which the ruling bureaucracy opts out of the contract and initiates transition to a regime based on private property and political competition. Incentive <b>compatibility</b> <b>and</b> time <b>consistency</b> problems inherent in the implicit contract between the bureaucracy and the activists may accelerate the movement toward regime change. The long-run trends in the communist party recruitment in the USSR {{and the end of the}} Soviet regime in 1991 are shown to be consistent with the model...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Interacting {{services}} {{are at the}} center of attention in businessto-business (B 2 B) process integration scenarios. Global interaction models specify the interaction behavior of each service and serve as contractual basis for the collaboration. Consequently, service implementations have to be consistent with the specifications. Consistency checking ensures that an implemented service is compatible with other services, i. e. that it can interact successfully with them. This is important in order to avoid deadlocks and guarantee proper termination of a collaboration. Different notions of compatibility between interacting services and consistency between specification and implementation are available but they are typically discussed independently from each other. This paper presents a unifying framework for <b>compatibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>consistency</b> and shows how these two notions relate to one another. Criteria for an optimal consistency relation with respect to a given compatibility relation are presented. Based on these criteria weak bi-simulation is evaluated. ...|$|E

We use a variant of signal temporal logic, namely, Stochastic Signal Temporal Logic (StSTL) to specify system behaviors as well as contract assumptions and guarantees, thus enabling automatic reasoning about requirements of stochastic systems. Given a stochastic linear system representation and a set of requirements captured by bounded StSTL contracts, we propose algorithms that can check contract <b>compatibility,</b> <b>consistency,</b> <b>and</b> refinement, and generate a controller to guarantee that a contract is satisfied, following a stochastic model predictive control approach. Our algorithms leverage encodings of the verification and control synthesis tasks into mixed integer optimization problems, and conservative approximations of probabilistic constraints that produce both sound and tractable problem formulations.

This paper takes stock of the existing material and tries to evaluate the suggestions and their possible effects. The underlying hypothesis is that a market-based instrument like the CDM might not be suited to achieving a balanced distribution of projects, and that additional measures may have to be considered to achieve a balanced clean development in every part of the world. In a first step, we look at the current situation of the CDM with regard to the distribution of projects. We then make an attempt to assess Africa’s CDM potential and correlate it with the numbers of inhabitants and the region’s level of CO 2 emissions. In the next chapter, we sum up the different barriers to an equitable distribution of CDM projects.

40|$|Governmental {{accountability}} is {{the requirement of}} government entities to be accountable to the citizenry {{in order to justify}} the raising and expenditure of public resources. The concept of service efforts and accomplishments measurement for government programs was introduced by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) in Service Efforts and Accomplishments Reporting: Its Time Has Come (1990). This research tested the feasibility of implementing the concept for the Federal-aid highway construction program and identified factors affecting implementation with a case study of the District of Columbia. Changes in condition and performance ratings for specific highway segments in 15 projects, before and after construction expenditures, were evaluated using data provided by the Federal Highway Administration. The results of the evaluation indicated difficulty in drawing conclusions on the state program performance, as a whole. The state program reflects problems within the Federally administered program that severely limit implementation of outcome-oriented performance measurement. Major problems identified with data acquisition are: data reliability, availability, <b>compatibility</b> <b>and</b> <b>consistency</b> among states. Other significant factors affecting implementation are institutional barriers and political barriers. Institutional issues in the Federal Highway Administration include the lack of integration of the fiscal project specific database with the Highway Performance Monitoring System database. The Federal Highway Administration has the ability to resolve both of the data problems, however interviews with key Federal informants indicate this will not occur without external directives and changes to the Federal “stewardship” approach to program administration. ^ The findings indicate many issues must be resolved for successful implementation of outcome-oriented performance measures in the Federal-aid construction program. The issues are organizational and political in nature, however in the current environment resolution is possible. Additional research is desirable and would be useful in overcoming the obstacles to successful implementation. ...|$|E
