5|$|A routine became {{established}} in which salesmen {{would provide the}} duckers with labels. The duckers would mark their ducklings with the labels of the firm to whom they wished them to be sold in London. The railway companies would <b>collect</b> ducklings, {{take them to the}} stations, ship them to London and deliver them to the designated firms, in return for a flat fee per bird. By avoiding the need for the duckers to travel to market, or the London salesmen to <b>collect</b> the ducklings, this arrangement benefited all concerned, and ducking became very profitable. By 1870 the duck industry was bringing over £20,000 per year into Aylesbury; a typical ducker would make a profit of around £80–£200 per year.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of ten differently colored modified box traps for <b>collecting</b> tabanids was {{studied in the}} Monjoroš Forest in eastern Croatia. A total of 5, 436 specimens belonging to 16 species of tabanids grouped into six genera were <b>collected.</b> The genus Tabanus was the most represented with 98 % of all <b>collected</b> tabanids. Tabanus bromius comprised 90 % of tabanids <b>collected,</b> and was the most abundant species <b>collected</b> in all box traps. The majority of tabanids (74 %) were <b>collected</b> from black, brown, bordeaux, red, and blue traps (dark group), whereas 26 % were <b>collected</b> from green, light violet, white, orange, and yellow traps (light group). The black modified trap was the most successful and <b>collected</b> 20 % of all <b>collected</b> tabanids, whereas the yellow trap was the least effective with 1 %. The number of <b>collected</b> specimens of species T. bromius differed significantly between the dark and light group of traps.

By collecting all 49 of them, seven in each level, the player unlocks a special The Itchy & Scratchy Show video. Several events cause the player to lose coins; because the character cannot die, injuries cause the player to lose coins. If the player is apprehended during a hit and run, they will be fined 50 coins.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to level keys, every level has one Primagen Key. The six Primagen Keys unlock {{the gate to}} the final boss in the hub area and require the player to use talismans to <b>collect</b> them. Talismans grant Turok special powers, such as allowing him to jump long distances or walk over lava. To use the power of a talisman, the player must <b>collect</b> a feather in a level and then take it to the talisman chamber from that level. There are five talismans in the game and every level, except for the first one, features a feather and a talisman chamber. The Primagen key from one particular level usually requires the player to use the talisman from the next level, except for the Primagen key from the last level, which requires the player to use four talismans. Therefore, the player needs to re-enter some levels more than once to <b>collect</b> all Primagen keys and complete the game.|$|E
