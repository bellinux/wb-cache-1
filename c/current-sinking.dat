5000|$|Like DTL, TTL is a <b>current-sinking</b> logic since {{a current}} must {{be drawn from}} inputs {{to bring them to}} a logic 0 level. At low input voltage, the TTL input sources current which must be absorbed by the {{previous}} stage. The maximum value of this input current is about 1.6 mA for a standard TTL gate. The input source has to be low-resistive enough (<500 Ω) so that the flowing current creates only a negligible voltage drop (<0.4 V) across it, for the input to be considered as a logical [...] "0" [...] (with a 0.4 V [...] "noise margin", see below). The output stage of the most common TTL gates is specified to function correctly when driving up to 10 standard input stages (a fanout of 10). TTL inputs are sometimes simply left floating to provide a logical [...] "1", though this usage is not recommended.|$|E
40|$|The 74 CBTLV 16211 {{provides}} a dual 12 -bit high-speed bus switch with separate output enable inputs (1 OE, 2 OE). The low on-state {{resistance of the}} switch allows connections to be made with minimal propagation delay. The switch is disabled (high-impedance OFF-state) when the output enable (nOE) input is HIGH. To ensure the high-impedance OFF-state during power-up or power-down, 1 OE and 2 OE should be tied to the VCC through a pull-up resistor. The minimum value of the resistor {{is determined by the}} <b>current-sinking</b> capability of the driver. Schmitt trigger action at control input makes the circuit tolerant to slower input rise and fall times across the entire VCC range from 2. 3 V to 3. 6 V. This device is fully specified for partial power-down applications using IOFF. The IOFF circuitry disables the output, preventing the damaging backflow current through the device when it is powered down. 2.

40|$|A display driver IC {{based on}} a <b>current-sink</b> driving scheme has been {{developed}} for QVGA (240 x 320), low-temperature poly-silicon (LTPS) active matrix organic light-emitting diodes (AMOLEDs) displays. The current-mode driver IC consists of a source driver block and a controller block. It uses a sample-and-hold scheme in the source driver block. The source driver block has 720 channel outputs, an 8 -bit segmented DAC, a pre-charge generation block, and a 64 -level gray scale (64 selections out of 256 gray levels for Gamma correction) per channel. The source driver output current ranges from 10 nA to 10 mu m. The controller block generates control signals for the source driver and UPS drivers (emission and scan driver), which are integrated on the panel glass. The current-mode driver IC was fabricated in a 0. 18 -mu m CMOS technology (two poly and four metals) with 5. 3 -V high-voltage transistor devicesclose 161...|$|R
40|$|Charge balance {{analysis}} and state transition analysis {{are presented in}} analyzing hysteretic voltage mode switching converters working in the steady state. It is shown that the ideal buck converter with a <b>current-sink</b> load can only work in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) but not in continuous conduction mode (CCM), and the same converter with a resistive load can work in CCM, but the output voltage ripple is very large compared to the hysteresis window. Previously published CCM designs are functional because their operations actually rely on the small but nonzero equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the filtering capacitor. For the CCM buck converter with nonzero ESR, our proposed state transition analysis gives a much more accurate switching frequency than previous approaches. The hysteretic voltage mode boost and buck-boost converters are then analyzed, and shown to have no feasible operating region. Crucial simulation results are presented to confirm the analyses...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The Naval Postgraduate School Spacecraft Architecture and Technology Demonstration Satellite, NPSAT 1, launching {{in the fall}} of 2006, will include a system to measure the performance of new experimental triplejunction solar cells. The measuring circuit in the Solar Cell Measurement System (SMS) is based on a circuit developed at the Naval Postgraduate School many years ago. It will trace the cells' current-voltage (I-V) curves while in orbit. The SMS consists of a radiation-hardened microcontroller that uses a radiation-hardened FPGA to monitor a collection of sensors. A <b>current-sink</b> circuit is used to measure the current and voltage on the test cells. Prior to launch, extensive testing is being performed on the system to ensure proper operation. The tests consist of subjecting solar cells and the measuring circuit electronics under conditions modeling the space environment while taking cell measurements. This thesis presents the mission information, system design, test setup, and test results of the SMS measuring circuit. Ensign, United States Naval Reserv...|$|R
