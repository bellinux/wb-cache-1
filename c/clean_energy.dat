5|$|Efficiency is {{essential}} to slowing the energy demand growth so that rising <b>clean</b> <b>energy</b> supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use. If energy use grows too fast, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. Likewise, unless <b>clean</b> <b>energy</b> supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed.|$|E

5|$|New {{government}} spending, regulation, {{and policies}} helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better {{than many other}} sectors. Most notably, U.S. President Barack Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included more than $70billion in direct spending and tax credits for <b>clean</b> <b>energy</b> and associated transportation programs. This policy-stimulus combination represents the largest federal commitment in U.S. history for renewables, advanced transportation, and energy conservation initiatives. Based on these new rules, many more utilities strengthened their clean-energy programs. Clean Edge suggests that the commercialization of <b>clean</b> <b>energy</b> will help {{countries around the world}} deal with the current economic malaise. Once-promising solar energy company, Solyndra, became involved in a political controversy involving U.S. President Barack Obama's administration's authorization of a $535million loan guarantee to the Corporation in 2009 as part of a program to promote alternative energy growth.

40|$|By using a {{language}} as accessible {{to a broad}} audience as possible, in this note we present evidence suggesting scientific caution prior to final claims that neutrinos and quarks are actual physical particles existing in our spacetime. We review historical and recent evidence dismissing the existence of neutrinos and quarks as physical particles, and outline recent theories representing experimental data without their existence. We also identify the negative implications for environmental issues of the neutrino and quark conjectures since they imply the suppression of due scientific process on new <b>clean</b> <b>energies</b> predicted by new structure models of hadrons with massive physical constituents produced free in spontaneous or stimulated decays. The note ends with the need of continuing theoretical and experimental research on neutrino and quark conjectures, but complemented, for evident scientific democracy, accountability and societal needs, with theoretical and experimental studies on alternative theories without the neutrino and quark conjectures and their prediction of new <b>clean</b> <b>energies.</b> 1.

40|$|AbstractChina is a coal-based energy {{consuming}} country. The proportion of coal {{is up to}} 70 % in the energy consumption structure in 1990 s. In the past 20 years, driven by energy saving policy, China's energy consumption structure has undergone great changes, especially in urban areas. This paper explores the evolution of energy-use structure {{at the national level}} and the level of Beijing City in China. Four major energy sources were considered, including coal, oil, natural gas and electricity. The dataset was collected from 1990 to 2012. The results show that the proportion of coal consumption decreased by approximately 20 % from 1990 to 2012 at the national level in compare with nearly 50 % at the level of Beijing City. Furthermore, the proportion of natural gas consumption and other <b>clean</b> <b>energies</b> rose.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to design the practices for the teaching laboratory on <b>clean</b> <b>energies,</b> focused on the process of bio-digestion of organic solid waste generated in the Camurí Grande community- Anare, as a strategy to allow technology-college students to understand the design of useful systems of utilization of these wastes under a technological and social approach. The method is analytical and includes the definition of the events (basic aspects and objective), construction and implementation of analysis matrix (development of laboratory practices taking into account all its dimensions), analyzes and conclusions where the performed practices related to the subject and their implications are explained considering all the dimensions from a systemic approach. The results are translated into the design of the <b>clean</b> <b>energies</b> teaching laboratory practices, mainly including the classification and characterization of the biogas produced in terms of energetic efficiency, scale testing of five selected houses that allow to establish the most adequate digestion process for production of biogas to ensure environmental mitigation and energy supply, as well as the transfer of this sustainable technology based mainly on the training of university students and community members. Conclusion: practices for the teaching laboratory of <b>clean</b> <b>energies</b> were formulated under a cooperative approach based on sustainability and meaningful learning, which can offer a comprehensive solution that contributes to the sustainable development of the community, and allows students of technological careers at USB Sede del Litoral to develop laboratory practices using a technological system as a technological, environmental and social solution to the community...|$|R
