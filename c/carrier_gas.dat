5|$|Unambiguous {{determination}} of the chemical characteristics of nihonium has yet to have been established. The isotopes 284Nh, 285Nh, and 286Nh have half-lives long enough for chemical investigation. It is theoretically predicted that nihonium should have an enthalpy of sublimation around 150kJ/mol and an enthalpy of adsorption on a gold surface around −159kJ/mol. From 2010 to 2012, some preliminary chemical experiments were performed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research to determine the volatility of nihonium. The reaction used was 243Am(48Ca,3n)288Mc; the isotope 288Mc has a short half-life and would quickly decay to the longer-lived 284Nh, which would be chemically investigated. Teflon capillaries at 70°C connecting the recoil chamber, where the nihonium atoms were synthesized, and the gold-covered detectors: the nihonium atoms would be carried along the capillaries by a <b>carrier</b> <b>gas.</b> While about ten to twenty atoms of 284Nh were produced, none of these atoms were registered by the gold-covered detectors, suggesting either that nihonium was similar in volatility to the noble gases or, more plausibly, that pure nihonium was not very volatile and thus could not efficiently pass through the Teflon capillaries at 70°C. Formation of the hydroxide NhOH would ease the transport, as nihonium hydroxide {{is expected to be}} more volatile than elemental nihonium, and this reaction could be facilitated by adding more water vapor into the <b>carrier</b> <b>gas.</b> However, it seems likely that this formation is not kinetically favored, so that the longer-lived isotope 286Nh, created as the granddaughter of 294Ts, might be more desirable for future experiments.|$|E

40|$|A {{growing demand}} for {{efficient}} air quality management calls {{for the development of}} technologies capable of meeting the stringent requirements now being applied in areas of chemical, biological and medical activities. Currently, filtration is the most effective process available for removal of fine particles from <b>carrier</b> <b>gases.</b> Purification of gaseous pollutants is associated with adsorption, absorption and incineration. In this paper we discuss a new technique for highly efficient simultaneous purification of gaseous and particulate pollutants from <b>carrier</b> <b>gases,</b> and investigate the utilization of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) imaging {{for the study of the}} dynamic processes associated with gas-liquid flow in porous media. Our technique involves the passage of contaminated <b>carrier</b> <b>gases</b> through a porous medium submerged into a liquid, leading to the formation of narrow and tortuous pathways through the medium. The wet walls of these pathways result in outstanding purification of gaseous, liquid and solid alien additives. NMR imaging was successfully used to map the gas pathways inside the porous medium submerged into the liquid layer. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|The {{formation}} of the source molecular beam therefore deserves special attention in Stark deceleration experiments. Common wisdom in molecular beam production methods may not automatically apply to Stark deceleration experiments. The use of your favorite pulsed valve, although performing well in other molecular beam environments, should be carefully considered. For instance, in most deceleration experiments the <b>carrier</b> <b>gases</b> Kr and Xe must be used to reduce the initial speed of the beam. Under specific conditions, however, these gases are known to produce clusters in the supersonic expansion, and some valves may perform poorly with these <b>carrier</b> <b>gases.</b> The operation conditions of the valves in {{this study did not}} result in any significant clustering.|$|R
25|$|GC-interface (combustion or pyrolysis) is also {{an online}} {{preparation}} method followed by IRMS detection. This is a 'compound-specific' method, allowing separation of analytes prior to measurement and thus providing information about the isotopic composition of each individual compound. Following GC separation, samples are converted to smaller gaseous molecules for isotope measurements. GC/pyrolysis uses the pyrolysis interface between GC and IRMS for the conversion of H and O in the molecules into H2 and CO. GC-IRMS was first introduced by Matthews and Hayes in the late 1970s, and was later used for δ13C, δ15N, δ18O and δ34S. Helium is used as the <b>carrier</b> <b>gas</b> in the GC systems. However, the separation of DH (m/z=3) signal from the tail of 4He+ beam was problematic due to the intense signal of 4He+. During the early 1990s, intense efforts were made in solving the difficulties to measure δD by GC/pyrolysis-IRMS. In 1999, Hilkert et al. developed a robust method by integrating the high temperature conversion (TC) into GC-IRMS and adding a pre-cup electrostatic sector and a retardation lens {{in front of the}} m/z=3 cup collector. Several different groups were working on this at the same time. This GC/pyrolysis-IRMS based on TC has been widely used for δD measurement nowadays. The commercial products of GC-IRMS include both combustion and pyrolysis interfaces so that δ13C and δD can be measured simultaneously.|$|E
2500|$|... Since {{ethylene}} oxide is explosive at concentrations above 3%, {{ethylene oxide}} was traditionally supplied with an inert <b>carrier</b> <b>gas</b> {{such as a}} CFC or HCFC. The use of CFCs or HCFCs as the <b>carrier</b> <b>gas</b> was banned because of concerns of ozone depletion. These halogenated hydrocarbons are being replaced by systems using 100% ethylene oxide because of regulations and {{the high cost of}} the blends. In hospitals, most ethylene oxide sterilizers use single use cartridges because of the convenience and ease of use compared to the former plumbed gas cylinders of ethylene oxide blends.|$|E
2500|$|TC/EA (or HTC, high {{temperature}} conversion; HTP, {{high temperature}} pyrolysis; HTCR, high temperature carbon reduction) is an 'online' or 'continuous flow' preparation method typically followed by IRMS detection. This is a [...] "bulk" [...] technique that measures {{all of the}} hydrogen in a given sample and provides the average isotope signal. The weighed sample is placed in a tin or silver capsule and dropped into a pyrolysis tube of TC/EA. The tube is made of glassy carbon with glassy carbon filling in which way oxygen isotope can be measured simultaneously without the oxygen exchange with ceramic (Al2O3) surface. The molecules are then reduced into CO and H2 at high temperature (> 1400 oC) in the reactor. The gaseous products are separated through gas chromatography (GC) using helium as the <b>carrier</b> <b>gas,</b> followed by a split-flow interface, and finally detected by IRMS. TC/EA method can be problematic for organic compounds with halogen or nitrogen due to the competition between the pyrolysis byproducts (e.g. HCl and HCN) and H2 formation. In addition, it is susceptible to contamination with water, so samples must be scrupulously dried.|$|E

2500|$|Aerodynamic {{enrichment}} processes include the Becker jet nozzle techniques developed by E. W. Becker and associates using the LIGA {{process and the}} vortex tube separation process. These aerodynamic separation processes depend upon diffusion driven by pressure gradients, as does the gas centrifuge. They in general have the disadvantage of requiring complex systems of cascading of individual separating elements to minimize energy consumption. In effect, aerodynamic processes {{can be considered as}} non-rotating centrifuges. Enhancement of the centrifugal forces is achieved by dilution of UF6 with hydrogen or helium as a <b>carrier</b> <b>gas</b> achieving a much higher flow velocity for the gas than could be obtained using pure uranium hexafluoride. The Uranium Enrichment Corporation of South Africa (UCOR) developed and deployed the continuous Helikon vortex separation cascade for high production rate low enrichment and the substantially different semi-batch Pelsakon low production rate high enrichment cascade both using a particular vortex tube separator design, and both embodied in industrial plant. [...] A demonstration plant was built in Brazil by NUCLEI, a consortium led by Industrias Nucleares do Brasil that used the separation nozzle process. However all methods have high energy consumption and substantial requirements for removal of waste heat; none are currently still in use.|$|E

They provide basic purification through single step distillation. However, contaminants and bacteria can rapidly build up if not frequently cleaned out. Bubblers cannot prevent entrainment of dissolved gas, volatile molecular contaminants, and micro-droplets that can carry particulate and ionic molecular contaminants. Process repeatability is limited due to control of process variables as well as thermal droop within the vessel with time.|$|E
