Most strains produced hemolysins, and 38 strains produced enterotoxin B. Acriflavine treatment of four strains resulted in elimination {{of resistance to}} methicillin and mercury; in one strain, resistance to cadmium was also lost. Production of enterotoxin B and β-hemolysin was eliminated in all four strains and penicillinase production was eliminated in one strain. In transduction experiments, methicillin resistance and enterotoxin B production were transferred together at a frequency of 0. 2 × 10 − 8 to 1. 1 × 10 − 8 by use of ultraviolet-induced phage lysates from naturally lysogenic methicillin-resistant strains. <b>Cotransductions</b> of resistance to mercury and cadmium, as well as production of penicillinase and β-hemolysin, were obtained to some extent.

40|$|Objective: During megakaryopoiesis, hematopoietic {{progenitor}} {{cells in}} the bone marrow proliferate and ultimately differentiate in mature megakaryocytes (MK). We and others have recently described a role for the mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) in proliferation and differentiation of MK cells. Two non-redundant complexes of mTOR have been described; mTORC 1 containing rapamycin-associated TOR protein (Raptor) and mTORC 2 containing Rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (Rictor). The individual roles of these complexes in MK development have {{so far not been}} elucidated, and were investigated in this study. Methods: We have used an siRNA approach to selectively knock down either Rictor or Raptor expression in MO 7 e megakaryoblastic cells. Using flow cytometry, nuclear ploidity, and cell cycling as assessed by BrdU incorporation were investigated. Electron microscopy and <b>cotransductions</b> with GFP-LC 3 were used to quantify autophagy. Activation of intracellular signal transduction pathways was studied by Western blot analysis. Results: We observed a reduced cell cycling upon Rictor siRNA transduction, resulting in decreased numbers of polypoid cells. Knocking down Raptor expression resulted in a reduced expansion and a reduced cell size. In addition, increased autophagy was observed in Raptor siRNA-transduced cells, in correspondence with an attenuation of activation of the p 70 S 6 K/S 6, and 4 E-BP pathways. Conclusions: The current study shows that the mTORC 1 and mTORC 2 complexes have distinct, non-redundant functions in MO 7 e MK cell proliferation, and development. The mTOR/Rictor complex affects megakaryopoiesis by regulating nuclear division and subsequent cell cycle progression, whereas Raptor signaling protects MK cells from autophagic cell death, enabling normal megakaryopoiesis to take place...|$|R

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model for nonrandom generalized transduction is proposed and analyzed. The model {{takes into account}} the finite number of transducing particle classes for any given marker. The equations for estimation of the distance between markers from <b>cotransduction</b> frequency data are derived and standard errors of the estimates are given. The obtained relationships depend significantly on the number of classes of transducing fragments. The model was applied to estimate the number of transducing fragment classes for a given marker in transduction with phage P 22 of Salmonella typhimurium. It was found that the literature data on frequencies of <b>cotransduction</b> in crosses with mutual substitution of selective and nonselective markers can be rationalized most accurately by assuming that the mean number of classes is equal to 2. An improved method for analysis of <b>cotransduction</b> data is proposed on the basis of our model and the results of calculation. The method relies on solving a set of algebraic equations for <b>cotransduction</b> frequencies of markers located within one phage length.

40|$|Recombinant {{adeno-associated virus}} (AAV) {{represents}} an efficient system for neuronal transduction. However, a potential drawback of AAV is its restricted packaging capacity of approximately 5 kb. To bypass this limita- tion, {{a number of}} dual- and triple-vector strategies divide the transgene(s) between two or three AAVs. The success of these approaches relies directly on efficient <b>cotransduction</b> of the component AAVs. Although proof of concept for these stratagems has been demonstrated, the underlying <b>cotransduction</b> rate has not been ana- lyzed quantitatively. In this study, <b>cotransduction</b> efficiencies in both retina and hippocampus have been in- vestigated, using two reporter AAVs expressing either a green (GFP) or red (DsR) fluorescent protein. Transduction efficiencies were monitored via microscopy, flow cytometry, and quantitative PCR. After viral transduction with 1. 5 ? 10 9 viral particles {{of each of the}} reporter AAVs, approximately one-third of the retinal cells expressed one or both transgenes at levels detectable by native fluorescence. Notably, the majority of the remaining retinal cells were also transduced and expressed the reporters at lower levels, which were detectable only by immunolabeling. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated <b>cotransduction</b> rates of up to 55 % with the two reporter AAVs in retinal cells. Modifying the ratio of the two coadministered AAVs resulted in altered mRNA expression levels of the two reporter genes in cotransduced cell populations.

40|$|Retroviral Replicating Vectors (RRVs) {{carrying}} the human codon optimized yeast cytosine deaminase (yCD 2) suicide gene {{are currently in}} Phase I/II clinical trials for treatment of high-grade glioma. These vectors are highly tumor specific due to their intrinsic inability to infect non-dividing cells, and their restriction by the innate immune system, which is often suppressed in the tumor microenvironment. Currently, this system relies on delivery of a single transgene, yCD 2, to the tumor mass. However, the current ‘gold standard’ in medical care is to treat cancer with a multi-drug regimen to combat the heterogeneous nature of tumors. As RRV therapy progresses, it must also {{address the issue of}} heterogeneity and seek to deliver more therapeutics to the cancer. These studies explore the possibility of using RRVs armed with multiple transgenes to improve the therapeutic efficacy of RRV-mediated cancer gene therapy. We examined the use of independent intrinsic promoter to drive RRV transgene expression in multiple cell lines. As transgene space in limited in RRVs, a smaller promoter was studied. Super Core Promoter (SCP 1) was found to have varying degrees of protein expression across different cell lines. As certain immune factors are confined to a therapeutic window, low expression of transgene by SCP 1 was used in U 87 cells to express cytokine mGM-CSF along with yCD 2. Protein levels of yCD 2 dropped, but the transgene still remained functional, while levels of mGM-CSF remained within the therapeutic range. The MLV 4070 A envelope, suffers from “superinfection resistance”, a phenomenon in which a virus is unable to infect cells that have already been infected by a virus expressing the same envelope protein. By switching out the envelope of RRV for different viral envelopes, the efficiency of <b>cotransduction</b> was studied across multiple cell lines. Results showed that <b>cotransduction</b> efficiencies varied between cell lines, potentially as a function of receptor availability or intrinsic viral immunity. Based on results from these studies, prime candidates for <b>cotransduction</b> of U 87 cells were established. Simultaneous <b>cotransduction</b> using two RRVs, expressing the noninterfering 4070 A (AC 3) and gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) envelopes, resulted in increased transgene expression from AC 3 -RRV, whereas transgene expression from GALV-RRV decreased slightly when compared to transduction with a single RRV. In order to increase transgene expression of larger transgenes without compromising transgene stability, P 2 A was attached to the end of 4070 A and GALV envelope proteins. P 2 A proved to increase protein expression in most cell lines compared to SCP 1, however, the vector copy number per cell decreased. GALV pseudotyped RRV with P 2 A was then used to cotransduce cells in combination with AC 3 -yCD 2. Expression of the yCD 2 transgene increased, while expression of the GALV-RRV transgene decreased slightly. Functional assays revealed that <b>cotransduction</b> with two RRVs resulted in increased cell death, except at the highest concentrations of ganciclovir. Thus use of pseudotyped RRVs to deliver multiple transgenes has the potential to increase the therapeutic efficacy of RRV-mediated gene therapy...|$|E
