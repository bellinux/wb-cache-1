The primary task of these volunteers is to sponsor and organized any many religious festivals and celebrations that occur through the year, as well as other duties. This may be paid for by collecting donations or paid for directly by the mayordomo. There are 422 officially recognized festivals during the year, including those local to specific communities. One of these more localized festivals is on May 3, Day of the Holy Cross, which has been celebrated in communities such as Santa Cruz Xochitepec (or Magdalena Xochitepec), Santa Cruz Acalpixcan and the center of Xochimilco for over 400 years.However, the best known mayordomo position is not for a festival, but rather for the care of an image of the child Jesus called the Niñopa.

40|$|Articles in {{this chapter}} {{emphasize}} the phenomenon of ion exchange across biomembranes. This topic has been of interest at least since 1947, when Hans Ussing articulated his model of ‘exchange diffusion ’ to account for an unexpected elevation {{in the rate of}} 22 Na+ efflux from skeletal muscle (Ussing, 1947). Ussing had tried to measure net Na+ movement by following tracer flux, but found that this approach greatly overestimated the true value. To explain this overestimate, Ussing postulated that isotopic flux reflected only isotopic exchange rather than net movement of mass, and he proposed the following model. Perhaps a negatively charged carboxyl group on some membrane element accepts the positively charged 22 Na+ so that the neutral complex can move through the membrane (mechanism unspecified) without interference from the electric field? If so, at the opposite surface, tracer could be discharged, replaced by (non-radioactive) 23 Na+, and the neutral complex would return to the original membrane surface, and at that point 23 Na+ would be released to let the <b>cycle</b> <b>begin</b> again. Clearly, by following the movement of 22 Na+, one might considerably overestimate the true net movement of Na+ itself...|$|E

40|$|The {{diffusion}} absorption {{refrigeration cycle}} was first identified {{nearly a century}} ago but until relatively recently its application had been limited to niche cooling applications such as camping refrigerators. The diffusion absorption refrigerator consists of several main components: a generator and bubble pump (a thermal pump), a condenser, evaporator, and an absorber. Unlike a vapour-compression cycle, the cycle operates at a single pressure level and uses three working fluids: a refrigerant, an absorbant and an auxiliary gas that {{is used in the}} system to equalize the pressure. Furthermore, where the ubiquitous vapour-compression refrigeration cycle requires work input to drive the compressor, the diffusion absorption refrigeration cycle is a thermally driven process. This characteristic has seen the <b>cycle</b> <b>begin</b> to receive the renewed attention due to the potential for it to operate using solar thermal energy to drive it. In this work the performance of an ammonia/water/hydrogen diffusion absorption refrigeration cycle is modelled for steady state operating conditions. The results show that the performance of the cycle is dependent on a number of variables including: the temperature and amount of heat added at the generator, the effectiveness of the heat recovery loops and the mass flow of the ammonia. Furthermore, it shows that the performance of the bubble pump plays a significant role in determining the performance of the system and is an area that requires further attention...|$|E

40|$|During spermatogenesis, step 1 {{spermatids}} (round spermatids) {{derive from}} spermatocytes following meiosis I and II at stage XIV of the epithelial <b>cycle</b> <b>begin</b> {{a series of}} morphological transformation and differentiation via 19 steps in rats to form spermatozoa. This process is known as spermiogenesis, which is marked by condensation of the genetic material in the spermatid head, formation of the acrosome and elongation of the tail. Since developing spermatids are lacking the robust protein synthesis and transcriptional activity, the cellular, molecular and morphological changes associated with spermiogenesis rely on the Sertoli cell in the seminiferous epithelium via desmosome and gap junction between Sertoli cells and step 1 - 7 spermatids. Interestingly, a unique anchoring junction type arises at the interface of step 8 spermatid and Sertoli cell known as apical ectoplasmic specialization (apical ES). Once it appears, apical ES is the only anchoring device restricted to the interface of step 8 - 19 spermatids and Sertoli cells to confer spermatid polarity, adhesion, signal communication and structural support, and to provide nutritional support during spermiogenesis, replacing desmosome and gap junction. While the adhesion protein complexes that constitute the apical ES are known, the signaling protein complexes that regulate apical ES dynamics, however, remain largely unknown. Herein we report {{the presence of a}} FAK (focal adhesion kinase) -p 130 Cas (p 130 Crk-associated substrate) -DOCK 180 (Dedicator of cytokinesis 180) -RhoA (Ras homolog gene family, member A) -vinculin signaling protein complex at the apical ES, which is also an integrated component of the beta 1 -integrin-based adhesion protein complex based on co-immunoprecipitation experiment. It was also shown that besides p-FAK-Tyr(397) and p-FAK-Tyr(576), beta 1 -integrin, p 130 Cas, RhoA and vinculin displayed stage-specific expression in the seminiferous epithelium during the epithelial cycle with predominant localization at the apical ES as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. Based on these findings, functional studies can now be performed to assess the role of this beta 1 -integrin-p-FAK-p 130 Cas-DOCK 180 -RhoA-vinculin protein complex in apical ES dynamics during spermiogenesis. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Two temperature-sensitive cell-cycle mutants {{were used}} to {{generate}} abnormally large cells (size estimated by protein content) with either normal or increased DNA contents. The first mutant, cd, blocks DNA synthesis, but allows cell growth at the restrictive temperature. The cells do not progress through the cell cycle while at the restrictive temperature, but do recover and complete the cell cycle when returned to permissive conditions. The progeny have increased cell size and normal DNA content. Downward regulation of cell size occurs during the ensuing cell cycle at permissive temperature. Two processes are involved. First, the Gt period is reduced or eliminated. As initial cell size increases there is a progressive shortening of the cell cycle to 75 % of normal. This limit cell-cycle duration is reached when the initial mass of the cell is {{equal to or greater}} than that of normal cells at the time of DNA synthesis initiation (0 - 25 of a cell cycle). Cells with the limit cell <b>cycle</b> <b>begin</b> macronuclear DNA synthesis immediately after fission. The durations of the S period and fission are normal. Second, the rate of cell growth is unaffected by the increase in cell size, and results in the partitioning of excess cell mass between the daughter cells at the next fission. The second mutant, cc 2, blocks cell division, but allows DNA synthesis to occur at a reduced rate so that cells with up to about 14 c % of the normal initial DNA content and twice the normal cell mass can be produced. The pattern of cell-cycle shortening is the same as in cd. The rates of growth and both the rate and amount of DNA synthesis are proportional to the initial DNA content. This suggests that the rates of growth and DNA synthesis are limited by the transcriptional activity of the macronucleus in both cd and cc 2 cells when they begin the cell cycle with experimentally increased cell mass. Increases in both cell size and initial DNA content are required to bring about increases in the rates of growth and DNA accumulation...|$|E
