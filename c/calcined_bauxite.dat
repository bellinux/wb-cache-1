The process {{can help to}} select low-cost commercially available oxides and can produce powders with nanometer size granules. On the other hand, high alumina cement provides high service temperature when used as refractory castable. Therefore, the effects of high-energy ball milling and subsequent calcinations on the formation of high alumina cementing phases using mixtures of Al 2 O 3 and CaCO 3 were investigated. Nano-meter sized high alumina cement (HAC) powders were synthesized by mechanochemical treatment of Al 2 O 3 and CaCO 3 in weight ratios 7 : 3 and 8 : 2. This paper compares the calcined high alumina cement obtained by mechanically activated precursor mix for 1, 2 and 3 h. Low cement castables were prepared from <b>calcined</b> Chinese <b>bauxite</b> as aggregate matrix, prepared HAC acting as hydraulic binder and micro-fine additives as pore filling agents. The bonding of high alumina cement as well as sinterability in these castable was studied with ZrO 2, α-Al 2 O 3 and SiC as micro-fine additives. Castables formulated by prepared high alumina cement demonstrate remarkably improved bulk density and apparent porosity as when compared with those prepared by commercially available cement. Casting water demand was also reduced, as a result quick setting behavior was observed. The addition of mechanochemically processed cements in refractory castables improved the thermo-mechanical properties to a significant extent...|$|R

HossainRoad {{surfaces}} may prematurely lose pavement friction due to polished aggregates on sharp horizontal curves, steep grades, or near intersections {{resulting in}} vehicle skidding. The problem gets exacerbated during wet weather. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) estimates that about 70 % of wet pavement crashes {{can be prevented}} or minimized by improving pavement friction. High Friction Surface Treatment (HFST), a specially-designed thin surface application of hard aggregates and thermosetting resins like epoxy, has been proven {{to be an effective}} method to increase road surface friction. <b>Calcined</b> <b>bauxite</b> has been predominantly used in the United States as the hard aggregate in combination with an epoxy binder for HFST. However, this treatment is expensive since the <b>calcined</b> <b>bauxite</b> is imported. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the performance of a local aggregate in HFST. Slab specimens of hot-mix asphalt (HMA) were compacted in the laboratory and treated with HFST systems incorporating both <b>calcined</b> <b>bauxite</b> and a local, hard aggregate, Picher Oklahoma flint aggregate.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the long term performance of the selected surface friction treatments, including high friction surface treatment (HFST) using <b>calcined</b> <b>bauxite</b> and steel slag, and conventional friction surfacing, in particular pavement preservation treatments such as chip seal, microsurfacing, ultrathin bonded wearing course (UBWC), and diamond grinding. This study also attempted to determine the correlation between vehicle crash and pavement surface friction, which {{makes it possible to}} quantitatively establish the so-called crash modification factors (CMFs) that are extremely useful in selecting a cost-effective solution to reduce wet pavement vehicle crashes. In-depth reviews were conducted to identify the aspects of the properties for aggregates used in HFST, including aggregate abrasion value (AAV), Los Angeles abrasion (LAA), Micro-Deval abrasion, and polished stone value (PSV). Extensive laboratory testing was conducted to examine the LAA, Micro-Deval abrasion, and PSV, and to provide first-hand data on the <b>calcined</b> <b>bauxite</b> and steel slag that may be used for HFST and friction surfacing in Indiana. Laboratory accelerating polishing was carried out {{to evaluate the}} effect of aggregate gradation and identify the HFST systems with satisfactory friction performance with respect to surface macro-texture and friction. Test strips were installed in the pavement on a real-world road to further evaluate the friction performances of the promising HFST systems under the true traffic polishing and assess the potential effect of winter and snow plough. Pull-off testing was also conducted to examine the bonding between the proposed HFST systems and the substrate surface. Field friction test data was utilized to evaluate the long-term friction performances of pavement preservation treatments, including chip seal, microsurfacing, UBWC, and diamond grinding. Statewide vehicle crash data between 2010 and 2014 was examined to determine the crash statistics associated with pavement friction.

40|$|Micro asphalt is a {{combination}} of nominal 6 mm aggregate, bitumen emulsion, Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), water and additive. This is mixed cold and applied in-situ by a purpose- built paver as a thin layer. The process meets many of the ideals of sustainable highway construction. The UK highway surfacing industry is dominated by hot mix asphalt types and a specification that asks for high skid resistant aggregate and texture depth to ensure wet skid resistance. Hot mix asphalt materials can result in a larger carbon footprint compared to micro asphalt. Production, transportation and installation of hot mix materials use higher amounts of energy compared to cold applied micro asphalt. Recent research has questioned whether there is the need to use limited reserves of high skid resistant aggregate in mixes with high texture depth that may generate excessive noise. It has been suggested that the use of smaller sized aggregate of lower skid resistance may provide acceptable levels of wet skid resistance by offering a greater number of contact points with a moving tyre compared to larger stone sizes. This argument formed the basic aim of the research reported in this thesis i. e. to assess whether the use of smaller sized mid range PSV aggregate in smaller carbon footprint micro asphalt would provide acceptable levels of wet skidding resistance. The research methodology has provided the opportunity to gather new data from a range of sources. It has developed new laboratory test methods to assess smaller sized aggregates and micro asphalt surfacing mixes. It has resulted in the first full-scale micro asphalt road trial in the UK to assess differing aggregates in the provision of wet skid resistance. This trial has allowed the development of micro asphalt early life skid resistance to be studied {{for the first time in}} detail over a 2 -year period. The trial has also' facilitated the first UK SCRIM/GripTester skid resistance measurement correlation study for micro asphalt. The research has provided improved understanding of the role of 2. 8 - 6. 3 mm porphyritic andesite aggregate in micro asphalt for the provision of wet skid resistance and made significant contributions to knowledge. Both the laboratory and full-scale A 26 road trial concluded that the different aggregate combinations used provided a durable surface and safe highway surface. The use of high PSV natural aggregate and the addition of imported <b>calcined</b> <b>bauxite</b> did not cause wet skid resistance to be significantly improved indicating that the mid range skid resistance aggregate offered acceptable performance i. e. a more sustainable use of natural resources. The micro asphalt mixes were found to offer immediate high levels of early life skid resistance and not suffer from early life issues of lower wet skid resistance experienced by some types of hot mix asphalt. The SCRIM / GripTester trial carried out with TRL found that data from the A 26 trial followed almost the exact same trend from the 2005 correlation study. This allows the data from the A 26 road trial to be quoted as equivalent SCRIM data if required and lets those involved in measuring skid resistance using GripTester know that it behaves in a similar manner. The research concludes that the use of small carbon foot print surfacing materials such as micro asphalt offer considerable opportunity to the UK highway industry in providing a safe, durable and sustainable surfacing material, while showing that there is a modest reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, primarily due to a reduction in travel distance for the micro asphalt material.
