Extensive modeling has been performed to demonstrate the value of using MOFs as membranes. MOF materials are adsorption-based, and thus can be tuned to achieve selectivity. The drawback to MOF systems is stability in water and other compounds present in flue gas streams. Select materials, such as ZIF-8, have demonstrated stability in water and benzene, contents often present in flue gas mixtures. ZIF-8 can be synthesized as a membrane on a porous alumina support and {{has proven to be}} effective at separating CO2 from flue gas streams. At similar CO2/CH4 selectivity to Y-type zeolite membranes, ZIF-8 membranes achieve unprecedented CO2 permeance, two orders of magnitude above the previous standard.|$|E

50|$|SOFC {{design and}} IGFC process {{configuration}} can greatly simplify {{the capture of}} carbon dioxide, which will increasingly be demanded for low greenhouse gas emissions of most fossil-fuel utilization processes. In conventional combustion, fuel is burned in air, resulting in exhaust gases containing large amount of nitrogen from which capture of a pure carbon dioxide stream (needed for storage of carbon in greenhouse gas emissions control scenarios) is inefficient. In oxy-combustion, oxygen is extracted from air and used for fuel combustion, resulting in exhaust gases uncontaminated with nitrogen from which capture of a pure carbon dioxide stream is efficient. However, a large energy penalty for doing the air separation required for isolating the oxygen stream {{in the first place}} is incurred. In contrast, for SOFC function neither inefficient carbon capture from exhaust gases nor air separation is required: the only required interaction of the anode and cathode reactant streams is the transfer of oxygen from cathode side (air) to anode side (fuel). All carbon, excepting the negligible amount in atmospheric air coming in at the cathode, will enter the module with fuel on the anode side, and it must exit the anode as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. By designing the SOFC module to keep anode and cathode off-gas streams separated, dilution of that carbon-rich stream with atmospheric nitrogen from the cathode side is avoided, allowing simple and inexpensive <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>separation</b> and capture downstream.|$|E

In this work, gas permeation properties of two fluorinated ionic liquids, tetrabutylammonium heptadecafluorooctanesulfonate and 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylpyridinium perfluorobutanesulfonate, were studied.

40|$|Zeolite {{membranes}} {{can potentially}} {{be used for}} separation of many types of mixtures. The membranes can be tailored {{by a number of}} methods to suit a specific separation application. In this work both traditional and new innovative methods were used to tailor the properties of zeolite membranes in order to enhance the selectivity for a given separation. In this work the traditional methods for tailoring of zeolite membranes by adjusting the Si/Al-ratio of, and exchanging the counterions in the zeolite have been used. In addition, two new methods have been developed: One where the impregnation concept often used in the catalysis field is adapted to tailor the properties of zeolite membranes for the first time, and another, where methylamine is used to modify the zeolite and form more and stronger basic sites. The polarity of a zeolite can be tailored by changing the Si/Al ratio in order to facilitate the separation of polar and non polar molecules. A low Si/Al ratio gives a more polar zeolite and vice versa. In the present work, separation of mixtures of water, hydrogen and n-hexane was investigated for membranes with two different Si/Al ratios (silicalite- 1 and ZSM- 5). The highest separation factors α-water/hydrogen were observed at 25 °C and were 14. 3 and 19. 7 for silicalite- 1 and ZSM- 5, respectively. Mixtures of methanol/ethanol, hydrogen, <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> and water were also investigated, and the highest measured methanol/hydrogen separation factor, 32, was achieved for a ZSM- 5 membrane, while a silicalite- 1 membrane was found to give the highest ethanol/hydrogen separation factor of 46. The polar ZSM- 5 favours the separation of the polar methanol, whereas the less polar silicalite- 1 is more favourable for separation of the less polar ethanol. These results confirm that the selectivity for these separations can be controlled by tailoring the polarity the zeolite. The effect of the counter ions in ZSM- 5 was studied by preparing, silicalite- 1 and ZSM- 5 membranes with three different counter ions (Na+, Li+ and Ba 2 +) and evaluating these for <b>separation</b> of quadrupolar <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> from binary and ternary mixtures of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide,</b> hydrogen and water. The aim was to develop a membrane suitable for <b>separation</b> of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> from synthesis gas. A separation factor α-carbon dioxide/hydrogen of 6. 2 was achieved for a BaZSM- 5 membrane at room temperature. In the BaZSM- 5 membranes, the permeances of both <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> and hydrogen were decreased by the presence of the Ba 2 +counter ion, but due to enhanced adsorption of the more quadrupolar <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> the <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> permeance was decreased much less than the hydrogen permeance. By development of a new and innovative impregnation procedure, <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> selective membranes with high flux were prepared by impregnating the pores of a silicalite- 1 membrane with calcium compounds to aid the adsorption of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide.</b> The <b>separation</b> experiments with mixtures of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> and hydrogen showed that the separation factor α-carbon dioxide/hydrogen at 25 °C was drastically changed from 0. 7 (hydrogen selective) to 3. 7 (<b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> selective) by this modification. A second new modification procedure was also developed, where MFI membranes with high Si/Al ratio were modified with methylamine to increase the <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> affinity and thus increase the <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> selectivity. These membranes were then evaluated for <b>separation</b> of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> from various mixtures of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide,</b> hydrogen, methane and water. The modification had significant effects on both permeances and separation factors and the selectivity towards <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> was increased considerably for all the feed mixtures tested. The results of the different modifications were evaluated by techniques such as SEM, TEM, XRD, DRIFT spectroscopy and by single component permeation and mixture separation experiments. High quality membranes with few defects are critical to study the effects of membrane modification and throughout this thesis adsorption-branch permporometry is used as a standard tool to evaluate membrane quality. The permporometry technique was also studied more in detail. It is shown how the distribution of flow-through defects can be estimated from the permporometry pattern. The estimated defect distribution is supported by SEM observations. In addition the permporometry data can be used to predict the permeance of molecules diffusing through defects in the membrane in mixture separation experiments and also indicate the separation factor.

40|$|AbstractThe {{improvement}} of <b>Carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> (CO 2) <b>separation</b> efficiency from flue gases {{to reduce the}} total energy cost of sequestration technologies in coal-fired power plants {{has been identified as}} a high-priority research area. In the past three decades, membranes have attracted the attention of chemists and engineers due to their unique separation principles (i. e., selective transport and efficient separation compared to other unit operations). In this study, the formation of cellulose acetate (CA) membrane for CO 2 /nitrogen (N 2) separation was investigated by wet phase inversion. In order to modify the CA membrane structure, different concentration ratio of solvent mixture (acetic acid:water), acetic acid and water were studied. The CA membranes were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The separation results supported by the characterization, where the best formulate membrane with solvent mixture ratio of 70 : 30 (acetic acid:water), acetic acid concentration of 63 wt% and water concentration of 27 wt% had high CO 2 permeance of 400. 92 GPU and slightly better CO 2 /N 2 separation performance at 32. 92 as compared to others literature...|$|R
