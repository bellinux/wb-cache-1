40|$|Heat-stable {{antibacterial}} {{activity in the}} following suspensions was demonstrated against Pseudomonas aeruginosa at pH 6. 5, 6. 0, and 5. 5 : (i) pooled colon contents of normal mice; (ii) an anaerobic, 48 -h culture of normal mouse feces; and (iii) anaerobic, 48 -h cultures of different bacteria from human <b>colon</b> <b>flora</b> (Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis). The lower the pH of the medium, the greater was the {{antibacterial activity}} of these suspensions. The antibacterial activity of five fatty acids (propionic, butyric, isobutyric, acetic, and formic acids) was greater against P. aeruginosa than against three Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis) at all fatty acid concentrations (0. 16 M to 0. 005 M) and at the 3 pH values studied (5. 5, 6. 0, and 6. 5). As the pH value increased, the antibacterial activity decreased. Antibacterial activity was greater at higher fatty acid concentrations, and at each pH value it was greatest for the fatty acids having high pKa values. Lactic acid, with the lowest pKa, exhibited little or no antibacterial activity. Acetic and butyric acids, {{two of the three}} predominant volatile fatty acids determined by gas chromatography in the mouse colon contents and in the anaerobic culture of mouse feces, occurred in vivo in concentrations which inhibited growth of P. aeruginosa in vitro at the pH of the mouse cecum. These results suggest that undissociated short-chain fatty acids produced by the <b>colon</b> <b>flora</b> may be a mechanism of intestinal resistance to colonization by P. aeruginosa...|$|E
40|$|A {{promoting}} {{effect of}} large bowel contents on colonic carcinogenesis {{as seen in}} the animal model is still incompletely explored in man. We investigated simultaneously deoxycholate absorption (as marker of colonic mucosal exposure to tumour promoting bile salt metabolites), mouth-anus transit time, and the ratio of anaerobic to aerobic bacteria in stool in 10 persons with colonic adenomas and in 10 age matched control subjects. We found that anaerobic/aerobic ratios and colonic deoxycholate absorption were higher in patients with colonic adenomas (p less than 0. 002 and p less than 0. 001) and that these parameters were clearly interrelated, which also applied to intestinal transit times and the anaerobic/aerobic ratios. These data are consistent with a promoting effect of the intracolonic environment on development of adenomas in man. Long term induction of a more aerobic <b>colon</b> <b>flora</b> and shortening of intestinal transit time may diminish bile-salt induced tumour promotion in adenoma patients...|$|E
40|$|Breast milk {{contains}} many biologically active substances, including {{epidermal growth factor}} (EGF), that are absent from artificial milk formulas. Previous studies have shown dramatic growth and maturation effects of milk-borne EGF on the intestine. This raises {{the question as to}} whether artificial milk formulas should be supplemented with biologically active substances, such as EGF. As a result, this dissertation examined whether feeding suckling rats artificial milk formula supplemented with EGF modulates liver development. The normal development of hepatic cells in suckling and weanling rats also was characterized. Additionally, this dissertation examined whether gut-derived endotoxin and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) play a role in liver development. Dam-fed suckling and weanlings showed increases in the reorganization of hepatocellular plates, numbers of binucleated hepatocytes, and a tendency for sinusoidal endothelial cell fenestrae density and porosity to increase with age. Monocytic derived cells increased at days 8 - 12 and decreased at day 16. Hepatic stellate cells decreased with age. <b>Colon</b> microbial <b>flora</b> and portal venous endotoxin were present from day 8 onward. Compared to artificial milk formula feeding alone, EGF in the artificial formula elicited increased numbers of binucleated hepatocytes, changes in <b>colon</b> microbial <b>flora,</b> and a tendency for increased numbers of Kupffer cells and portal venous endotoxin. Compared to breast milk, the artificial diet caused decreases in binucleated hepatocytes, increases in monocytic derived cells, Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells, portal venous endotoxin and changes in the composition of the <b>colon</b> microbial <b>flora.</b> These increases in cells may be due to colonization of the <b>colon</b> with microbial <b>flora</b> which increased portal venous endotoxin. Increased endotoxin may provide a stimulus for the recruitment of monocytic derived cells to the liver and differentiation into Kupffer cells, which then stimulates hepatic stellate cell proliferation. However, the increases in portal venous endotoxin were not sufficient to elicit hepatic TNFα, mRNA production. In conclusion, milk-borne EGF is involved in differentiation of hepatocytes and changes <b>colon</b> microbial <b>flora</b> that occur in suckling rats. Whether accelerating maturation of hepatocyte is beneficial or detrimental to the suckling rats remains to be determined. Therefore, the supplementation of artificial milk formula with EGF warrants further consideration and research...|$|R

40|$|Children who {{present with}} chronic diarrhea, {{flatulence}} and/or abdominal pain possibly suffer from malabsorption of carbohydrates. Most frequently this {{depends on a}} lactase deficiency causing a carbohydrate overload in the colon. The fermentation of these carbohydrates by anaerobic bacteria can provoke osmotic diarrhea and gas production in the bowel. The hydrogen-breath test can easily be used to diagnose which kind of carbohydrates are causing the symptoms. When carbohydrates are digested by anaerobic bacteria, hydrogen is set free, which {{can be measured in}} exhaled breath. The results are plotted on a curve. Certain circumstances influence this test. False negative results are seen in 5 to 10 % non-producers due to the absence of hydrogen producing bacteria in their <b>colon</b> <b>flora</b> or in case of recent antibiotic use. False positive results can be caused by the presence of undigestable oligosaccharides or carbohydrates in the colon or also in case of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. It is necessary to evaluate test results in relation to symptoms during and shortly after the test procedure. These symptoms need to resemble the complaints which raised the suspicion on the carbohydrate malabsorption...|$|E

Numbers of lactobacilli and clostridia remained unaffected by colitis, irrespective of the TLR-genotype of mice. Culture-independent molecular analyses confirmed the microflora shifts towards enterobacteria during colitis and showed that the gut flora composition was similar in both, healthy wt and TLR-deficient animals. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: DSS-induced colitis {{is characterized by a}} shift in the intestinal microflora towards pro-inflammatory Gram-negative bacteria. Bacterial products exacerbate acute inflammation via TLR 2 - and TLR 4 -signaling and direct the recruitment of neutrophils and regulatory T-cells to intestinal sites. E. coli may serve as a biomarker for colitis severity and DSS-induced barrier damage seems to be a valuable model to further identify bacterial factors involved in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and to test therapeutic interventions based upon anti-TLR strategies...|$|E
40|$|Background: Recent theory {{proposes that}} the {{appendix}} {{functions as a}} reservoir for commensal bacteria, and serves to re-inoculate the <b>colon</b> with normal <b>flora</b> {{in the event of}} pathogen exposure or purging of intestinal flora. If true, we reasoned that flora from a normal appendix could provide protection against Clostridium difficile. We conducted this investigation to examine the protective effect of an intact appendix and test the hypothesis that prior appendectomy will be more common among patients with a positive test for C. difficile as compared with patients who test negative. Methods: We contacted patients who had undergone C. difficile testing and asked them whether or not they had a prior appendectomy. Using their responses and results from Toxin A & B EIA tests, we calculated the difference in appendectomy rates between those who tested positive for C. difficile, and those who tested negative. We considered a positive 15 % absolute difference to represent a significant increase in appendectomy rate. Results: We enrolled 257 patients. Among the 136 who tested positive for C. difficile, 27 (19. 9 %) had prior appendectomies, while among 121 patients testing negative for C. difficile, 38 (31. 4 %) had Manuscript accepted for publication December 1, 2011...|$|R
40|$|Mucositis manifesting as {{diarrhoea}} is {{a common}} side effect of chemotherapy which remains poorly understood. It {{is one of a}} number of manifestations of alimentary mucositis, which affects the entire gastrointestinal tract. The exact number of patients that are affected by diarrhoea as a result of treatment is uncertain, although it is believed that approximately 10 % of patients with advanced cancer will be afflicted. Despite advances in the understanding of oral and small intestinal mucositis over recent years, large intestinal mucositis, including diarrhoea, has not been well defined and the underlying mechanisms of the condition are yet to be established. The majority of the literature available concerning diarrhoea is based on clinical observations, with very little basic research existing. However, from the research conducted, it is likely that the intestinal microflora and mucins play a role in the development of chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea. This thesis will examine in detail what is known about the mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea (CID). Furthermore it will explore the potentially important relationship between intestinal microflora, the luminal environment and the subsequent development of chemotherapy-induced mucositis and diarrhoea. 5 -Fluorouracil (5 -FU) {{is a common}}ly used chemotherapy agent in clinical oncology practice. Two of its major side effects are mucositis and diarrhoea. The structure of mucins offers mucosal protection, and allows maintenance of intestinal flora by providing attachment sites and preventing bacterial overgrowth and/or penetration. Following treatment with 5 -FU, we showed decreases in Clostridium spp., Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus spp., and an increase in Escherichia spp. in the jejunum. In the colon, 5 -FU caused decreases in Enterococcus spp., Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus spp. Real time PCR of faecal samples showed decreasing trends in Lactobacillus spp. and Bacteroides spp., and an increasing trend in E. coli. Significant increases (p< 0. 05) were seen in Clostridium spp. and Staphylococcus spp. at 24 h. Goblet cell numbers decreased significantly in the jejunum from 24 - 72 h, with a significant increase in the percentage of cavitated goblet cells, suggesting 5 -FU treatment causes significant changes in intestinal flora and mucin secretion in rats. These changes could result in systemic effects, and in particular may contribute to the development of chemotherapy-induced mucositis. Irinotecan causes cholinergic and delayed onset diarrhoea in patients, in which β-glucuronidase produced by gut bacteria is thought to be involved. Diarrhoea was observed in treated rats, as expected, following irinotecan treatment. β-glucuronidase expression increased in the jejunum and <b>colon.</b> Faecal <b>flora</b> changed quantitatively after treatment also, with increases in E. coli, Staphylococcus spp., and Clostridium spp. (all β-glucuronidase producing), and decreases in Lactobacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp. (both beneficial bacteria), and Bacteroides spp. (β-glucuronidase producing, major component of intestinal flora), suggesting that irinotecan-induced diarrhoea may be caused by an increase in β-glucuronidase producing bacteria. However, the increase in bacteria may also be caused by irinotecan, further exaggerating the toxicity of the drug, and emphasising the need for these specific bacteria to be therapeutically targeted for successful treatment regimens to be accomplished. Mucus production appears to be increased after irinotecan treatment, which may contribute to the development of diarrhoea. Goblet cells were demonstrated to decrease significantly after irinotecan treatment. However, mucin secretion increased. Mucin expression changed significantly after treatment. Muc 2 and Muc 4 decreased significantly in the villi of the jejunum after treatment, Muc 2 and Muc 4 decreased significantly in the crypts. Muc 2 decreased significantly in the colon. This indicates that irinotecan causes an increase in mucin secretion and a net decrease in mucin-producing goblet cells, and the expression of Muc 2 and Muc 4 in the gastrointestinal tract is altered following treatment. Increased mucin secretion is likely to be related to altered mucin expression, and may contribute to chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea. To determine if the changes to the intestinal microflora caused by chemotherapy could be translated to the clinic, a pilot clinical study was carried out. Sixteen patients experiencing CID were recruited to the study with two control subjects. A large proportion of patients (75 %) demonstrated a reduced anaerobic component of their faecal microflora. A reduced diversity of species was also observed in patients. The majority of patients exhibited decreases in Clostridium spp., Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp., whilst all patients exhibited decreases in Bacteroides spp. and Enterococcus spp. Patients receiving antibiotics did not exhibit any marked differences to patients not receiving antibiotics. This indicates that the results observed in the animal studies are clinically relevant, and further research into this area should be undertaken. CID is associated with marked changes in the intestinal microflora. These changes may result in diminished bacterial functions within the gut, altering gut function and initiating intestinal damage, resulting in the onset of diarrhoea. In conclusion, there is clear evidence demonstrating chemotherapy treatment results in changes to the intestinal microflora and mucin secretion, which may be responsible in part for the development of severe mucositis and diarrhoea. Irinotecan toxicity may be compounded by the increase in β-glucuronidase producing bacteria. The intestinal flora of cancer patients experiencing CID is also noticeably different to that of healthy subjects. Irinotecan causes changes to mucin secretion, and the specific expression of Muc 2, Muc 4 and Klf 4, suggesting that secretory control by the enteric nervous system may also be affected by chemotherapy. This research has extended the understanding of chemotherapy-induced mucositis and diarrhoea, complex side effects of chemotherapy. However, new areas for future research have also been identified.
