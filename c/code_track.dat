40|$|The {{proposed}} Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA) Facility, {{an innovative}} exotic-beam facility {{for the production}} of high-quality beams of short-lived isotopes, consists of a fully superconducting 1. 4  GV driver linac and a 140  MV postaccelerator. To produce sufficient intensities of secondary beams the driver linac will provide 400  kW primary beams of any ion from hydrogen to uranium. Because of the high intensity of the primary beams the beam losses must be minimized to avoid radioactivation of the accelerator equipment. To keep the power deposited by the particles lost on the accelerator structures below 1 [*]  W/m, the relative beam losses per unit length should be less than 10 ^{- 5 }, especially along the high-energy section of the linac. A new beam dynamics simulation <b>code</b> <b>TRACK</b> has been developed and used for beam loss studies in the RIA driver linac. In the TRACK code, ions are tracked through the three-dimensional electromagnetic fields of every element of the linac starting from the electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion source to the production target. The simulation starts with a multicomponent dc ion beam extracted from the ECR. The space charge forces are included in the simulations. They are especially important in {{the front end of the}} driver linac. Beam losses are studied by tracking a large number of particles (up to 10 ^{ 6 }) through the whole linac considering all sources of error such us element misalignments, rf field errors, and stripper thickness fluctuations. For each configuration of the linac, multiple sets of error values have been randomly generated and used in the calculations. The results are then combined to calculate important beam parameters, estimate beam losses, and characterize the corresponding linac configuration.

The accuracy of this code delay estimation is strictly connected with the accuracy of user position computation.

The cavity is similar to the 805 MHz high-{beta} cavity developed for the Spallation Neutron Source Linac, but the resonant frequency (1. 3 GHz) and beam tube diameter (78 mm) are the same as for the {beta} = 1 cavities developed for the TESLA Test Facility.

The beam dynamics <b>code</b> <b>TRACK</b> has been originally developed at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) {{to fulfill the}} special requirements of the rare isotope accelerator (RIA) accelerator systems. From the beginning, the code has been developed to make it useful in the three stages of a linear accelerator project, namely, the design, commissioning, and operation of the machine. To realize this concept, the code has unique features such as end-to-end simulations from the ion source to the final beam destination and automatic procedures for tuning of a multiple charge state heavy-ion beam. The TRACK code has become a general beam dynamics code for hadron linacs and has found wide applications worldwide. Until recently, the code has remained serial except for a simple parallelization used for the simulation of multiple seeds to study the machine errors. To speed up computation, the TRACK Poisson solver has been parallelized. This paper discusses different parallel models for solving the Poisson equation with the primary goal to extend the scalability of the code onto 1024 and more processors of {{the new generation of}} supercomputers known as BlueGene (BG/L). Domain decomposition techniques have been adapted and incorporated into the parallel version of the TRACK code. To demonstrate the new capabilities of the parallelized TRACK code, the dynamics of a 45  mA proton beam represented by 10 ^{ 8 } particles has been simulated through the 325  MHz radio frequency quadrupole and initial accelerator section of the proposed FNAL proton driver.

40|$|The {{front end}} of any modern ion {{accelerator}} includes a radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ). While many pulsed ion linacs successfully operate RFQs, several ion accelerators worldwide have significant difficulties operating continuous wave (CW) RFQs to design specifications. In this paper we describe the development and results of the beam commissioning of a CW RFQ designed and built for the National User Facility: Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System (ATLAS). Several innovative ideas were implemented in this CW RFQ. By selecting a multisegment split-coaxial structure, we reached moderate transverse dimensions for a 60. 625 -MHz resonator and provided a highly stabilized electromagnetic field distribution. The accelerating section of the RFQ occupies approximately 50 % of the total length {{and is based on}} a trapezoidal vane tip modulation that increased the resonator shunt impedance by 60 % in this section as compared to conventional sinusoidal modulation. To form an axially symmetric beam exiting the RFQ, a very short output radial matcher with a length of 0. 75 βλ was developed. The RFQ is designed as a 100 % oxygen-free electronic (OFE) copper structure and fabricated with a two-step furnace brazing process. The radio frequency (rf) measurements show excellent rf properties for the resonator, with a measured intrinsic Q equal to 94 % of the simulated value for OFE copper. An O^{ 5 +} ion beam extracted from an electron cyclotron resonance ion source was used for the RFQ commissioning. In off-line beam testing, we found excellent coincidence of the measured beam parameters with the results of beam dynamics simulations performed using the beam dynamics <b>code</b> <b>TRACK,</b> which was developed at Argonne.

40|$|Due to {{the unique}} {{properties}} of BOC signals, some of the existing tracking algorithms used for traditional BPSK should be modified to tailor for the new signals while eliminating the trade-off such as the tracking ambiguity. Moreover, it is impractical to apply a single technique to all BOC signals. Therefore {{it is important to}} look for a series of practical solutions (particularly for the <b>code</b> <b>tracking</b> loop) and develop the associated theory to describe the tracking behaviour for the general forms of BOC modulations. This research investigates GNSS receiver <b>code</b> <b>tracking</b> discriminators and architectures for different BOC signals, for a compromise between low structural complexity and high precision, while still taking advantage of the novel properties of BOC signals. Most of the existing <b>code</b> <b>tracking</b> discriminator techniques for BOC signals can be summarized as use of tailored reference waveform. One of these techniques tailored for BOC(fs,fc) with n= 2 fs/fc= 2 and sin-phased subcarrier modulation (e. g. BOCs(m 1,m 1)), is the BOC-PRN discriminator. This technique works for BOC(1, 1) with relatively low implementation complexity while completely mitigating a famous problem: <b>code</b> <b>tracking</b> ambiguity. However, due to its poor performance in both multipath and noise mitigation, it has attracted little interest and there is not much supporting literature on this technique. One contribution of this research is to explore the potential of BOC-PRN correlation and strobe waveforms to compensate these drawbacks.
