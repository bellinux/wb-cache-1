40|$|The immune system, which {{defends the}} body against {{a wide array}} of threats, is gaining a growing role in the fight against cancer. For an {{immunotherapy}} to be successful, it needs to overcome intrinsically weak tumour-specific immune responses. There are two broad approaches to achieving this goal: targeting the various arms of the immune system or targeting the cancer and its microenvironment. The experiments discussed in this thesis adopt the second approach. Tumours were transduced with a combination of costimulatory molecules: CD 48, CD 54, CD 70 & CD 86, the chemokine CX 3 CL 1 and the cytokines: IFNÎ³, GM-CSF and IL- 12. Transduction of <b>costimulatory</b> <b>molecules</b> enhances priming in-vitro and cause tumour rejection and delayed tumour growth in-vivo. This effect is demonstrated with single <b>costimulatory</b> <b>molecules</b> but is more pronounced when multiple <b>costimulatory</b> <b>molecules</b> are transduced. Addition of the cytokines and chemokine enhanced tumour rejection, and also resulted in partial rejection of contralateral parental tumours. Attempts to enhance anti-tumour memory by fusing IL- 2 and IL- 15 to their respective receptors are also discussed. Work in a human/mouse chimeric PD- 1 mouse model shows that transduction of multiple <b>costimulatory</b> <b>molecules</b> is able to overcome intrinsic anti-PD- 1 resistance. Radiation is known to result in upregulation of several <b>costimulatory</b> <b>molecules</b> within tumours or their infiltrating dendritic cells. The experiments presented here suggest that radiation therapy may be useful in overcoming anti-PD- 1 therapy resistance.

The cDNA is sequenced and the sequence encoding the variable heavy and variable light chains of these antibodies are cloned together using a small peptide linker. This resulting sequence encodes the scFv. This can be cloned into a transgene, encoding what will become the endodomain of the CAR.

Oral administration of JCM 1222 (T) to mice alleviated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) -induced acute colitis. The expression of type 1 helper T (Th 1) - and IL- 17 producing helper T (Th 17) -specific cytokines and transcriptional factors was suppressed by JCM 1222 (T) treatment. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) from colitic mice induced IL- 17 A production from CD 4 (+) T cells in a cell-cell contact-dependent manner, and this was suppressed by oral treatment with JCM 1222 (T).

SGH of L. longipalpis induced an increase in interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), IL- 8 and IL- 12 p 40 production but a decrease in tumor necrosis factor alpha and IL- 10 production by lipopolysaccharida (LPS) -stimulated monocytes. We also examined the expression of <b>costimulatory</b> <b>molecules</b> on the surface of monocytes, Mφs, and DCs. Whereas SGH affected the expression of these molecules on monocytes and Mφs, it had little effect on these molecules on DCs. However, when DCs were generated from human monocytes in the presence of SGH, SGH inhibited the expression of <b>costimulatory</b> <b>molecules.</b> In addition, a decrease in the maturation of DCs induced by CD 40 L was observed in the presence of SGH. Finally, preincubating SGH with human sera containing anti-SGH-specific antibodies abolished the effects of SGH on cytokine production by LPS-stimulated monocytes...|$|R
40|$|T cell {{mediated}} immune responses are induced following interaction of MHC-presented epitope on professional antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) with cognate T cell receptor. Up-regulation of receptor-ligand pairs of <b>costimulatory</b> <b>molecules</b> linking DC to T cell enhances the resulting T cell responses. This 2 ̆ 7 second signalling 2 ̆ 7 occurs through the B 7 molecules CD 80 / 86 expressed by DCs, and importantly through {{members of the}} TNF ligand/TNF receptor superfamilies. We have previously shown that co-expression of RANK/RANKL or 41 BB-L in addition to tumour antigen in dendritic cells augmented cognate effector and memory tumour antigen-directed cytotoxic T cell responses when the DCs were used to immunise mice. Here, we examined whether co-immunisation with naked plasmid DNAs encoding antigen and these <b>costimulatory</b> <b>molecule(s),</b> would enhance antigen specific T cell responses. We demonstrate that co-immunisation with DNAs encoding tumour antigen and <b>costimulatory</b> <b>molecules</b> failed to enhance antigen-directed CTL responses, or tumour protection, afforded by immunisation with DNA encoding tumour antigen alone.
