The study showed that, about 39. 00 percent of RCC farm owners were landless, 31. 00 percent were small and marginal farmers, 17. 00 percent were medium and 13. 00 percent were large farmers according to their landholding sizes. The cost of rearing RCC per cattle per year was found to be Tk. 17503. 76, Tk. 15540. 27, and Tk. 33044. 03 as <b>cash</b> <b>cost,</b> non <b>cash</b> <b>cost</b> and total cost respectively.

Therefore, climate impact mitigation strategies {{have to be}} developed based on comprehensive assessments of the different impacting factors. We quantify the climate impact mitigation potential and related costs resulting from changes in aircraft operations and design using a multi-disciplinary model workflow. We first analyze the climate impact mitigation potential and <b>cash</b> operating <b>cost</b> changes of altered cruise altitudes and speeds for all flights globally operated by the Airbus A 330 - 200 fleet in the year 2006.

Based on this analysis, new design criteria are derived for future aircraft that are optimized for cruise conditions with reduced climate impact.
