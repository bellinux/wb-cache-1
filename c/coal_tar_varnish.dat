40|$|International audiencePAHs are main {{constituents}} of <b>coal</b> <b>tar,</b> which is found on coking plant wastelands. The pumping rate of these DNAPLs is generally low {{due to its}} viscous nature and its high residual saturation. The goal {{of this study is}} to investigate effects of temperature on <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> recovery and determine if a thermal enhancement can improve the pumping efficiency. <b>Coal</b> <b>tars</b> used in this work were sampled from a pilot siteof a former coking plant. In order to understand how thermal remediation would enhance <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> recovery, we first investigated temperature sensitivity on <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> properties including density, viscosity, interfacial tension and contact angle with water. Viscosity is affected by temperature and showed a five-fold decrease when <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> is heated from 10 °C to 50 °C. Other <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> parameters, like wettability, were not significantly alteredby temperature changes. The lack of wettability variations due to temperature indicate that <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> residual saturationshould not be affected by thermal enhancement. However, the decrease in its viscosity shows that <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> under the water table can be remobilized by heating processes. As a consequence, the recovery rate of <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> would effectively increase, if a thermally enhanced pumping is used. We also conducted drainage-imbibition experiments of <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> – water system in a one-dimensional column to determine the impact of temperature on capillary pressure-saturation curves.

The theoretical results were compared to experimental pumping tests performed in laboratory in a two-dimensional tank to validate the numerical model. The next step is to perform the experiments in non-isothermal cases and to improve the numerical model bycouplingcoal tar-water flow with transient heat transfers in order to realistically model a thermally enhanced pumping.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Coal</b> <b>tar</b> ointments {{are used}} as {{treatment}} of various skin diseases, especially psoriasis and eczema. These ointments contain several carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Metabolites of these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are excreted in the urine and therefore, dermatological use of <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> {{may be associated with}} an increased risk of bladder cancer. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the association between dermatological use of <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> ointments and bladder cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A population-based case-control study was conducted including 1, 387 cases diagnosed with bladder cancer and 5, 182 population controls. Information on the use of <b>coal</b> <b>tar,</b> history of skin disease, and known risk factors for bladder cancer was obtained through postal questionnaires. Logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the risk of bladder cancer after <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> treatment, adjusted for age, gender, smoking status, duration of smoking, and intensity of smoking. RESULTS: The use of <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> ointments was approximately equal among cases and controls (3. 8 % vs. 3. 0 %, respectively). Dermatological application of <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> was not significantly associated with bladder cancer (adjusted odds ratio = 1. 37, 95 % CI: 0. 93 - 2. 01). An inverse association between bladder cancer and a history of skin disease was observed (adjusted odds ratio = 0. 74, 95 % CI: 0. 61 - 0. 90). CONCLUSION: This is the first study with a specific aim to study the association between the use of <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> preparations and bladder cancer.

40|$|Topical {{application}} of <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> {{is one of}} the oldest therapies for atopic dermatitis (AD), a T helper 2 (Th 2) lymphocyte-mediated skin disease associated with loss-of-function mutations in the skin barrier gene, filaggrin (FLG). Despite its longstanding clinical use and efficacy, the molecular mechanism of <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> therapy is unknown. Using organotypic skin models with primary keratinocytes from AD patients and controls, we found that <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> activated the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), resulting in induction of epidermal differentiation.

40|$|<b>Coal</b> <b>tar</b> {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} and an {{effective}} treatment for psoriasis. <b>Coal</b> <b>tar</b> has been directly applied to the skin, or used in combination with UV light as part of the Goeckerman treatment. The use of <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> has caused long-term remissions in psoriasis, but has fallen out of favor because the treatment requires hospitalization and <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> is poorly acceptable aesthetically to patients. Thus, determining the active antipsoriatic component of <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> is of considerable therapeutic interest. We fractionated <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> into its components, and tested them using the SVR angiogenesis inhibitor assay. Treatment of SVR endothelial cells with <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> fractions resulted in the isolation of a single fraction with antiangiogenic activity. The active antiangiogenic compound in <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> is carbazole. In addition to antiangiogenic activity, carbazole inhibited the production of inflammatory IL- 15 by human mononuclear cells. IL- 15 is elevated in psoriasis and is thought to contribute to psoriatic inflammation. Carbazole treatment also reduced activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is proinflammatory and elevated in psoriasis. The effect of carbazole on upstream pathways in human psoriasis was determined, and carbazole was shown to inhibit signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat) 3 -mediated transcription, which has been shown to be relevant in human psoriasis. IL- 15, iNOS, and stat 3 activation require the activation of the small GTPase rac for optimal activity. Carbazole was found to inhibit rac activation as a mechanism for its inhibition of downstream inflammatory and angiogenic pathways. Given its antiangiogenic and anti-inflammatory activities, carbazole is likely a major component of the antipsoriatic activity of <b>coal</b> <b>tar.</b> Carbazole and derivatives may be useful in the therapy of human psoriasis...|$|R
