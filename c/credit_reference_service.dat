40|$|Abstract <b>Reference</b> <b>services</b> {{have always}} been {{essential}} in academic libraries by meeting undergraduates’ information needs for enhanced academic achievement. It provides personalised information services to users in ensuring that their needs are adequately satisfied. However, in recent times, users’ satisfaction with <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> has become of great concern, as poor satisfaction of <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> will negatively affect subsequent use. There is dearth of scholarly research on patronage of <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> by undergraduates in Nigeria. The study, therefore, investigated the influence of users’ needs and satisfaction on the patronage of <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> by undergraduates in selected universities in Osun State, Nigeria. The survey research design was adopted for the study while questionnaire tagged “User Needs, Satisfaction, and Patronage of <b>Reference</b> <b>Services</b> (UNSPRS) ” was used for data collection. Random sampling technique was used to select 400 out of 29, 013 undergraduates in the selected universities in Osun State. Frequency counts, mean and standard deviation, correlation and multiple regression were used to analyse the data with hypotheses tested at 0. 05 level of significance. The results showed that inadequate time for <b>reference</b> <b>services,</b> lack of current <b>reference</b> materials, poor <b>service</b> quality and unfriendly reference personnel affect the patronage of <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> by the undergraduates. <b>Reference</b> <b>services</b> were moderately patronised by the undergraduates. The mean analysis revealed that undergraduates of the selected universities showed a moderate need for <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> and are only moderately satisfied with the <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> available to them. There was positive significant relationship between user needs and patronage of <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> (r= 0. 455, P 3 ̆c 0. 05). There was also {{a significant relationship between}} user satisfaction and patronage of <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> (r= 0. 422, P 3 ̆e 0. 05). The study recommended that the university libraries in Osun State should provide user-oriented <b>reference</b> <b>services</b> that will meet the users’ needs and increase patronage by undergraduates.
