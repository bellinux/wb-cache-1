40|$|D. Litt. et Phil. The {{research}} {{aim of this}} study was to develop a self-knowledge program for career counselling practitioners based on psychological type, and to evaluate the program in practice. The theory of psychological type, based on the work of Jung, McCaully, Murphy, Myers and Briggs, and Quenk, presents a practical communication model for the career <b>counselling</b> <b>interview.</b> The theory builds a basic structure of how the individual perceives and process information and how he or she evaluates and makes decisions with this information. It gives an understanding of the communication process in the career <b>counselling</b> <b>interview</b> with regard to the psychological types of both the client and the practitioner. A design and development research model was applied to develop and evaluate the self-knowledge development program. The four phases of the model are problem analysis and project planning, design, development, and evaluation. During the phase of problem analysis, the relevant literature in the field of psychology and related fields were researched. It was concluded that there was a need for a self-development program for career counsellors based on psychological type, and the project was planned. During the development phase, a practice model, role descriptions and specific skills of career counselling, were extended with regard to psychological type. This served as an explanatory model to develop the tentative self-development program. During the development phase the program was used in two pilot studies, with final year counselling students, in a workshop format. Data generated during the pilot studies was used to refine the program. For the final evaluation phase, the format was adapted to a workbook format that could be used by the individual practitioner...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{highlight}} the <b>counselling</b> <b>interview</b> in connection with the choice of upper secondary school from three perspectives, the student's, the counsellor's and society's. The intention is to describe and analyse the <b>counselling</b> <b>interview</b> in the ninth grade with relation to: · the student's expectations, perceptions and values before and after the interviews, · the counsellor's perceptions and values after the interviews, · society's goals and purpose for student counselling in secondary schools and · the theories and models for career development and counselling. Eight students from both sexes with diverse grades have been chosen, and all their interviews in year 9 to-gether with the four counsellors have been recorded and analysed. In the theory chapter, theories connecting three perspectives are described, the individual, the counsellor and society. Career development theories are used to describe and explain the process behind student choice. Counselling theories are used to illustrate what is happening during the interviews and frame factor theories to explain how decision and choice is influenced and limited by different factors in society. In conclusion it can be stated that educational and vocational orientation is not sufficiently well integrated into the school curriculum and educational activities. The role of the counsellor has primarily been to help stu-dents in the ninth grade to make a well thought-out decision through interviews. These interviews can also be described as meetings with certain in-built rituals. The counsellor took the initiative, questioned the students, continued to give information and then guided the student to a decision. Such a description is of course simpli-fied but does give a picture of counselling that is tightly framed by factors that the counsellor and student have difficulty breaking away from. Another way of describing counsellors is to see them as catalysts and co-ordinators who partly tried to start processes particularly to widen perspectives, and partly worked to connect the students' ideas and lack of ideas with those possibilities offered...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{misuse of}} {{antibiotics}} has {{been related to}} increased morbidity, mortality and bacterial resistance. The development of antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASPs) has been encouraged by scientific societies as an essential measure. An educational, institutionally supported ASP was developed in our tertiary-care centre. Local guidelines on the management of infectious syndromes were created. Antimicrobial prescriptions were chosen arbitrarily weekly and <b>counselling</b> <b>interviews</b> by expert clinicians were carried out, using a paedagogic, non-restrictive methodology. Satisfaction with the interview was assessed using anonymous questionnaires. The appropriateness of antimicrobial prescriptions as well as consumption was assessed prospectively throughout the year. Feedback regarding the correct use of treatments was communicated to each participating department periodically. The improvement in antimicrobial prescription was included among the annual objectives linked to economic incentives in every department. A total of 1206 <b>counselling</b> <b>interviews</b> were carried out during the first year. Fifty-three per cent of antimicrobial prescriptions (176 / 332) were inappropriate when the programme started. The rate of inappropriate prescriptions continuously declined to 26. 4 % (107 / 405) in the fourth trimester (p < 0. 001; RR = 0. 38; 95 % CI, 0. 23 – 0. 43). Antimicrobial consumption decreased from 1150 defined daily doses (DDDs) per 1000 occupied bed-days in the first trimester to 852 DDDs in the fourth, reflecting a reduction in antimicrobial expenditures of 42 %. A total of 352 satisfaction questionnaires were received and 98 % described the advice as positive. In conclusion, the implementation of an education-based ASP achieved a significant improvement in all antimicrobial prescriptions in the centre {{and a reduction in}} antimicrobial consumption, even when no restrictive measures were implemented.

40|$|IntroductionAfter stroke {{preventive}} {{treatments are}} a primary determinant {{to avoid a}} recurrent cardiovascular event. However, patient's adherence to long-term treatment is quite low [1]. Collaborative with healthcare providers, the pharmaceutical intervention already showed impact on drug therapy (pharmaceutical care concept). This concept is established in Canada for a long time, and begin to emerge in Europe [2]. ObjectiveTo develop pharmaceutical interviews with stroke survivors in hospital, and to bring this approach to community pharmacies. MethodsIndividual semi-guided interviews were conducted in two steps: (a) evaluation of patient's knowledge, skills and self-care; (b) providing appropriate structured information according to patient's needs. For (a) a specific questionnaire incorporating problems relating to generic drugs and hygiene and dietary follow-up was developed; educational tools were used for (b) : picture book, packages of drugs. At {{the end of the}} interview, information sheets and a management plan “how to take treatments” were given. This approach, developed in neurological rehabilitation unit, was then used in community pharmacy with ambulatory patients to test practicability of the method. ResultsA total of 26 interviews were conducted: 20 inpatients and 6 outpatients. (a) The level of drug knowledge varies and no {{difference between the two groups}} was observed. Some notions are well known such as treatment start-up date (respectively 85 and 83 %), management plan of treatments (60 and 67 %). On the other hand, therapeutic indication of treatment (40 and 33 %), what to do in risk situations (37 and 33 %) or in the case of adverse event (11 and 0 %), and hygiene and dietetic rules (45 and 33 %) were less known. (b) Patients were very satisfied with the <b>counselling</b> <b>interview.</b> DiscussionInterviews with ambulatory patients confirmed the feasibility of this approach first developed at the hospital. Patient's knowledge remains partial, including patients treated for a long time. It is now necessary to assess the impact of this pharmaceutical intervention on long-term health care's quality...|$|E
40|$|Background: Alcohol Brief Intervention (ABI) uses {{a motivational}} {{counselling}} approach to support individuals to reduce excessive alcohol consumption. There is growing evidence on ABI’s use within various health care settings, although {{how they work}} and which components enhance success is largely unknown. This paper reports on the qualitative part of a mixed methods study. It explores enablers and barriers associated with alcohol reduction following an ABI. It focuses on alcohol’s place within participants’ lives and their personal perspectives on reducing consumption. There {{are a number of}} randomised controlled trials in this field though few ABI studies have addressed the experiences of hazardous/harmful drinkers. This study examines factors associated with alcohol reduction in harmful/hazardous drinkers following ABI. Methods: This qualitative study was underpinned by a realist evaluation approach and involved semistructured interviews with ten harmful or hazardous alcohol drinkers. Participants (n = 10) were from the intervention arm of a randomised controlled trial (n = 124). All had received ABI, a 20 min motivational <b>counselling</b> <b>interview,</b> six months previously, and had reduced their alcohol consumption. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. Results: Participants described their views on alcohol, its’ place in their lives, their personal perspectives on reducing their consumption and future aspirations. Conclusions: The findings provide an insight into participants’ views on alcohol, ABI, and the barriers and enablers to change. Participants described a cost benefit analysis, with some conscious consideration of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} reducing intake or abstaining from alcohol. Findings suggest that, whilst hospital admission can act as a catalyst, encouraging individuals to reflect on their alcohol consumption through ABI may consolidate this, turning this reflective moment into action. Sustainability may be enhanced by the presence of a ‘significant other’ who encourages and experiences benefit. In addition having a purpose or structure with activities linked to employment and/or social and leisure pursuits offers the potential to enhance and sustain reduced alcohol consumption.

40|$|The use {{of audio}} and {{videotape}} recordings in counsellor {{education for the}} purpose of training and supervision is controversial. Although recordings give counsellors and supervisors direct access to the counselling session and therefore the skills of the counsellor, a number of concerns have been recorded both in early research (Betcher & Zinberg, 1988; Frankel, 1971; Gelso, 1973; Goldstein, 1988; Lamb & Mahl, 1956; Niland, 1971; Van Atta, 1969) and more recently in counsellors’ correspondence to the NZAC Newsletter (Anonymous, 2006; Grant, 2006) regarding the effects on counsellors, clients and on the counselling process itself. There is a scarcity of current research on whether or not recording of counselling or therapeutic interviews actually interferes with the counselling process. The few empirical studies of the effects of recording are inconsistent in their findings and their methodological flaws preclude meaningful interpretation of the literature as a whole (Goldstein, 1988). This qualitative research study focuses on one aspect of recording counselling interviews; the perceptions of counselling students. Thirteen counselling students enrolled on counsellor education programmes at five tertiary educational settings in Auckland and Christchurch, New Zealand participated in interviews. They indicated that they perceived the process of recording to be anxiety promoting, initially having an effect on their ability to be completely present in the <b>counselling</b> <b>interview.</b> They also reported that recording was extremely beneficial to the development of effective counselling skills. Counsellors perceived the process of recording to be a potential threat to the developing relationship between counsellor and client but many were able to manage this concern by establishing trust and rapport before introducing recording. The majority of the student counsellors perceived that they became more confident with the process over time, moving from a state of anxiety in initial recordings to a more relaxed style with practice. This has implications for future practice and for early introduction to frequent recording in counsellor education programmes...|$|E
40|$|The career {{counselling}} services industry {{is currently being}} challenged by {{a unique set of}} conditions which has resulted in calls for a greater client orientation in the delivery of career services. The current study takes up this challenge by using marketing concepts to explore the relationship between the expectations (desired) people in career transition have of a {{career counselling}} service and the perceptions career counselling service providers have of client expectations. In the process, it also examines variables (career transition group membership, career decision-making self-efficacy, age, gender, and previous experience with a career counselling service) that may impact on the expectations people in career transition have of a career counselling service. The study used a three-phased mixed method approach to gather expectation and perception data. In Phase 1, focus group interviews were conducted with participants from three career transition groups - Year 12 students, final year university students, and adults in midcareer transition. A series of one-to-one interviews with three groups of career counsellors (those in schools, tertiary institutions, and private practice) was undertaken in Phase 2. Phase 3 consisted of a questionnaire, which was administered to broader populations of people in career transition and career counsellors. The people in career transition subject group completed a three-part questionnaire consisting of the Expectations About Career Counselling measure (developed by the researcher), the Career Decision-Making Self-Efficacy-Short Form (an existing measure), and demographic questions. Career counsellors completed a two-part questionnaire, which included the Expectations About Career Counselling (EACC) and demographic questions. The people in career transition subject group {{were asked to respond to}} the EACC according to what they wanted from a career counselling service. Career counsellors were asked to respond to the same measure as if they were one of their clients attending their first career <b>counselling</b> <b>interview.</b> In the development of the EACC, an existing measure (the Expectations About Counselling-Brief Form; Tinsley, 1982), was modified using career counselling expectation themes derived from the analysis of data collected in Phases 1 and 2. Factor analysis of the data obtained from the EACC identified four clear factors. These factors were named Career Counsellor Responsibility, Client Responsibility, Quality Outcome and Realism. The findings from Phase 3 indicated that people in career transition had high to very high expectations for the EACC subscales Career Counsellor Responsibility and Quality Outcome, moderate expectations for Realism, and moderate to high expectations for Client Responsibility. Significant differences were found based on transition group membership, gender, age, and previous experience with a career counselling service. In addition, it was found that people in career transition had moderate to high career decision-making self-efficacy and that respondents with higher self-efficacy scores also had higher expectations of a career counselling service. The findings also indicated that there was a significant difference or gap between the expectations of people in career transition and the perceptions of career counsellors concerning client expectations of career counselling. Career counsellors perceived that clients were less committed and more unrealistic about the career counselling process and the counsellor's role than was indicated by the results from the people in career transition subject group. Recommendations based on the findings of this research study were made for career counsellors, professional associations, education and training organisations, education institutions and systems and government policy makers. Specifically, the recommendations addressed the importance of acknowledging, clarifying, and managing client expectations, providing interventions to educate people in career transition about the career decision-making process and the role of the career counsellor, and the implementation of processes to promote ongoing professional development in the career counselling services industry...|$|E

By 1999—as a result of {{certain aspects of the}} documentaries discussed above, as well as allegations made by advocates for Branch Davidians during litigation—public opinion held that the federal government had engaged in serious misconduct at Waco. A Time poll conducted on August 26, 1999, for example, indicated that 61 percent of the public believed that federal law enforcement officials started the fire at the Branch Davidian complex. In September of that year, Attorney General Reno appointed former U.S. Senator John C. Danforth as Special Counsel to investigate the matter.

Chronic consumer debtors exist {{in an environment of}} ongoing efforts to survive financially and meet their debt commitments. Despite otherwise favourable economic conditions for the community at large such as low interest rates and low levels of unemployment, the chronic consumer debtor remains continuously at peril of overcommitment. An analysis of financial <b>counselling</b> <b>interviews</b> in New South Wales (the largest state in Australia) has been used to identify the group that the authors believe to be most at risk of chronic consumer debt in Australia. Other independent studies are provided to support the choice of the identified group. The situation for chronic consumer debtors is contrasted to the situation for acute cases. While financial literacy and support programmes can be provided to the community, the ability to target programmes towards a specifically identifiable group concentrates activities on measures aimed to alleviate the distress caused by ongoing financial hardship for one particular consumer group. The challenge of reducing chronic consumer debt has the potential to raise awareness and understanding of risk factors for consumer debtors generally. Thus, concentrated efforts towards alleviating chronic consumer debt may lead to a reduction in consumer financial overcommitment...|$|R

DESIGN: Multiyear cross-sectional study of first-time attenders in Clinique de Confiance, a confidential STD clinic; biannual community-based behavioral surveys. METHODS: From 1992 to 1998, female sex workers were invited to attend Clinique de Confiance, where they were <b>counseled,</b> <b>interviewed,</b> clinically examined during their first visit and tested for STD and HIV infection. Community-based surveys, conducted in 1991, 1993, 1995, and 1997, interviewed women regarding socio-demographic characteristics and HIV/STD-related knowledge, attitudes and behavior. RESULTS: Among female sex workers in Abidjan, there was a trend toward shorter duration of sex work, higher prices, and more condom use. Among sex workers attending Clinique de Confiance for the first time, significant declines {{were found in the}} prevalence of HIV infection (from 89 to 32 %), gonorrhoea (from 33 to 11 %), genital ulcers (from 21 to 4 %), and syphilis (from 21 to 2 %).

However, {{in comparison to the}} wealth of general counselling research, there is a relative lack of research involving clients with {{an intellectual}} disability. In particular, there is a scarcity of research exploring the clients’ subjective experiences of counselling. This thesis therefore seeks {{to gain a better understanding}} of this under-explored area of counselling practice by inquiring of the two parties most intimately acquainted with the counselling process – clients and counsellors. Complementing the views of clients and counsellors, the views of support workers and key informants are also described. Using a qualitative case study methodology, six clients with an intellectual disability were interviewed about their subjective experiences of <b>counselling.</b> <b>Interviews</b> were also conducted with their counsellors and with nominated support people.

40|$|Clients’ {{experiences}} {{in attempting to}} access counselling help have rarely been studied. As such, a full and clear understanding of clients’ experiences with accessing services, as well as identification of the barriers encountered by clients and clients’ ideas about what would make accessing more comfortable, have eluded researchers. Typically, the research focus has been quantitative investigations of the no-show phenomenon, whereby clients fail to arrive at pre-booked counselling appointments. Such studies have left 24 % {{of the variance in}} the unexplained "other" category. More recently, researchers have begun to question whether or not mental health stigma impacts counselling attendance. The present study sought to describe the experience of individuals who self identified as having booked a counselling appointment within the previous 8 -months and then had failed to attend. A basic interpretive qualitative research design (Merriam, 2002) was employed for the purpose of describing and understanding this phenomenon, with special emphasis given to identifying possible barriers to accessing <b>counselling.</b> <b>Interviews</b> with four middle class Caucasian adults aged 27 - 33; two of whom had accessed counselling previously and two of whom had not, were conducted.

After seeking help through counselling, participants had experienced a wide variety of approaches and there were positive and negative perceptions of each. Other perceptions related to therapist characteristics {{and the way in which}} interventions were carried out. Recommendations for practitioners are given...|$|R
40|$|Career {{counselling}} {{is central}} to facilitating high school students’ postsecondary goals. Research studies have revealed student dissatisfaction with career guidance, but how do counsellors respond? Dialogue between counsellors who provide guidance and students who are discontent with career planning services is scarce. Counsellor and student opinions need to be collaborated and communicated {{to each other for}} practical and relevant practice. This thesis considers counsellor and student perspectives to inform effective career education in secondary schools. A mixed methods approach was used to examine existing policies in place at one Ontario high school. A survey of 35 Grades 11 and 12 students assessed student initiative towards, and opinions about, <b>counselling.</b> <b>Interviews</b> with 2 counsellors provided a more in-depth understanding of the counsellor-student discourse, contextualised realistic practice, and suggested methods to manage student expectations and needs. Findings indicated complementary results. Students were largely confident in their postsecondary goals, but a smaller percentage credited counsellors for their success. A majority of students sought advice from their counsellors, but responded differently on the quality of guidance received. Many Grade 12 students felt they were not receiving enough exclusive and specific attention. Counsellors’ multifaceted responsibilities did not allow for special attention to the graduating class. Differences between counsellor and student perspectives lay in their respective opinions about effective practice. However, both parties felt more counsellors or lower student-tocounsellor ratios would benefit their working relationship and improve provisions for student needs. Results suggest the need to better define counsellor and student responsibilities. Assessment of student concerns and counsellor responses support a proposal to infuse career development into other high school subject areas. Career education needs to encourage student independence and enforce student accountability for their career development...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} systematic desensitization and cognitive self-control training procedures in reducing anger arousal, overt hostility, and aggression; and their effectiveness in increasing constructive action in therapists conducting <b>counselling</b> <b>interviews</b> with child abusers. Thirty graduate social work students who indicated that they sometimes become at least mildly angry toward parents or caretakers who physically abuse children participated in the study. The students who volunteered for the study were randomly assigned to three treatment conditions in a pretest/posttest control group design. Anger was aroused experimentally in the subjects using laboratory provocations which consisted of six imaginal interviews with abusive and non-abusive parents. The imaginal interviews were conducted in a language laboratory using an automatically synchronized slide-tape program. The systematic desensitization and cognitive self-control treatments consisted of two one-hour training sessions administered within the same week. The criterion measures employed in the experimental study included (a) Reaction Inventory (Evans & Stangeland, 1971), (b) Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory (factor analytic version [...] Bendig, 1962), (c) Hostility Scale Applicable to Verbal Samples (Gottschalk, Winget, & Gleser, 1969), (d) Self-Report Rating of Anger Scale (Novaco, 1975), (e) Self-Report Rating of Aggression Scale (Novaco, 1975), and (f) Self-Report Rating of Constructive Action Scale (Novaco, 1975). Analysis of covariance of the experimental data indicated no statistically significant treatment differences on any of the six dependent measures. Although statistical significance was not achieved, the pre-treatment and post-treatment means showed changes in the desired direction on the six dependent measures for the systematic desensitization treatment group. The cognitive self-control treatment group means showed changes in the desired direction on five of the dependent measures. The empirical results were discussed with reference to theoretical concepts of anger arousal, and the research literature on experimental studies of training procedures relevant to anger control...|$|R
40|$|Solution-focused brief {{therapy is}} a client-focused and {{strengths}} based counselling approach {{aimed at helping}} clients identify and build on their own resources to achieve change and live the life they want. Part of this approach includes using feedback as an intervention. This feedback, discussed by the counsellor and client {{at the end of}} a counselling session, aims to highlight and validate clients’ strengths and resources and encourages the client to use these (to construct a task) and help achieve the change s/he wants. The semi-formal structure of the feedback is termed the summation message. While it is considered an essential part of solution-focused brief therapy, little research on its use is available, particularly from the client’s perspective. This thesis addresses this gap in the research. I conducted solution-focused counselling with three clients and, using qualitative research methods, gathered their perspectives on what they experienced as helpful from the summation messages. I also explored how engaging in the research informed my own solution-focused practice. Research data consisted of transcribed <b>counselling</b> <b>interviews,</b> observation notes, <b>counselling</b> notes, analytic and reflexive memos. I used a thematic analysis approach, informed by the interpretive paradigm, to analyse the data and generate four major themes on clients’ perspectives of the feedback technique. Excerpts of client responses highlight the following themes: the break time helped clients to recognise their own resources and enabled the development of client-chosen tasks; feedback encouraged clients to describe their own tasks; feedback encouraged a deeper awareness about resources identified in the counselling session and reflecting on the co-construction of their own solutions enabled clients to feel empowered by their summation messages. These findings are a valuable addition to practice-based research on solution-focused counselling and, particularly on the importance of using the summation message to encourage client agency...|$|R
