This is due to environmental concerns that lead to using more renewable resources in composite structures.

Cellulose exhibited better thermal stability and lignin was degraded {{in a wide range}} of temperatures. The hydrophilic nature of the fibres was predominantly caused by the presence of hemicellulose and then lignin constituents. Hemicellulose and lignin were mostly removed by the alkalisation with higher concentrations of NaOH, followed by acetylation. Silane treatment could not remove the hemicellulose and lignin, rather this treatment facilitated coupling with the fibre constituents. ...|$|R

50|$|Since {{paper is}} {{produced}} from wood fibres, {{it was possible}} to transfer some of the developments achieved in wood technology to paper technology. Several technologies (e.g. chemical modification, nano-scale celluloses, polyelectrolytes, functional polymers based on cellulose, hemicelluloses and starch) were researched and used by different research groups around Europe (e.g. PTS and University of Goettingen, Germany; Kungliga Tekniska högskolan (KTH), Sweden.) There is already well established knowledge on <b>chemical</b> <b>fibre</b> modification of recycled fibres. Adamopoulos and Mai (2011) modified recycled fibres with N-methylol compounds and glutaraldehyde with significant improvement on fibre characteristics and paper sheet performance. Laboratory sheets manufactured with a variety of chemically modified recycled fibres were found to be superior in stiffness and hygroscopic properties than these manufactured from unmodified ones.

40|$|The {{systematic}} {{study of}} collective action by business is an "enfant industry" in the scholarly enterprise. Compared {{to the thousands}} of volumes devoted to describing, explaining, and (often) extolling the action of trade unions, those devoted explicitly to trade and employer associations could barely fill a single library shelf. Compared to the heroics of worker demonstrations, strikes, and uprisings, the efforts of capitalists to defend their interests collectively are bound to appear prosaic. If fashion and emotion were not enough, theory has also conspired to discourage the study of cooperation and collusion among consenting capitalists. Liberals try to convince us that only the competitive interaction of individuals as producers/ consumers and citizens/voters leads to social choices and determines societal outcomes; Marxists assure us that capitalists do not need to act collectively, their dominance being assured "at the point of production" or "through the state". Nevertheless and without any specific protection or subsidization, an enfant industry of studying collective action by business has emerged and even begun to prosper during the past two decades. It has had to cut across the usual compartments of academic specialization and to develop its own concepts and assumptions. It has relied heavily on international comparative analysis among advanced industrial societies, which imposes a weighty burden on individual scholars or extracts high transaction costs from collaborative efforts. It is still a hazardous and difficult market to enter, especially for a graduate student attempting his first major piece of research.

For different uranium compounds specified according to their solubility and purity, and 16 other categories of pollutants: <b>chemicals,</b> <b>fibres,</b> vapours, dust, and heat a time- and plant-specific job exposure matrix (JEM) was created covering the period 1960 - 2006.

Although exposure assessment was semi-quantitative, the JEM allows computing of individual cumulative exposure score for each pollutant across time. Despite the predominant natural uranium compounds exposure, the amount of exposure to other pollutants such as TCE and other chlorinated products, asbestos, and fibres, is important at the plant.
