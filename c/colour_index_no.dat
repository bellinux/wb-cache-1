Untreated fruits remained firm and green for 11 days and reached <b>colour</b> <b>index</b> <b>No.</b> 4 in 13. 75 days. Ethylene, acetylene and ethrel triggered ripening at all concentrations used. The higher the concentration is, {{the higher the}} ripening rate. Ethylene at 1000 ppm was the most effective treatment, and fruits at that concentration reached <b>colour</b> <b>index</b> <b>No.</b> 4 only after 2. 75 days. Ethylene was 100 times more effective than acetylene and 20 times more effective than ethrel. Ethylene at 10 ppm, acetylene at 1000 ppm and ethrel at 200 ppm gave the same fruit ripening rate and similar fruit quality and acceptability. Khartoum University Pres...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{applicability}} of effective temperature scales of several broad band colours to T Tauri stars (TTS). We take into account different colour systems as well as stellar parameters like metallicity and surface gravity which influence the conversion from <b>colour</b> <b>indices</b> or spectral type to effective temperature. For a large sample of TTS, we derive temperatures from broad band <b>colour</b> <b>indices</b> and check if they are consistent in a statistical sense with temperatures inferred from spectral types. There are some scales (for V-H, V-K, I-J, J-H, and J-K) which indeed predict the same temperatures as the spectral types and therefore can be at least used to confirm effective temperatures. Furthermore, we examine whether TTS with dynamically derived masses {{can be used for}} a test of evolutionary models and effective temperature calibrations. We compare the observed parameters of the eclipsing T Tauri binary V 1642 Ori A to the predictions of evolutionary models in both the H-R and the Kiel diagram using temperatures derived with several <b>colour</b> <b>index</b> scales. We check whether the evolutionary models and the <b>colour</b> <b>index</b> scales are consistent with coevality and the dynamical masses of the binary components. It turns out that the Kiel diagram offers a stricter test than the H-R diagram. Only the evolutionary models of Baraffe et al. (1998) with mixing length parameter 1. 9 and of D'Antona & Mazzitelli (1994, 1997) show consistent results in the Kiel diagram in combination with some conversion scales of Houdashelt et al.

For this purpose we have combined all the groups into a single system, where velocities v and radius r are expressed adimensionally. We have used several methods to compare the distributions of relative velocities of galaxies with respect to the group centre for samples selected according to their spectral type (as defined by Madgwick et al., 2002), bj band luminosity and B-R <b>colour</b> <b>index.</b> We have found strong segregation effects: spectral type I objects show a statistically narrower velocity distribution than that of galaxies with a substantial star formation activity (type II-IV). Similarly, the same behavior is observed for galaxies with <b>colour</b> <b>index</b> B-R> 1 compared to galaxies with B-R - 19) galaxies show the same segregation. It is not important once the sample is restricted to a given spectral type. These effects are particularly important in the central region (Rp<Rvirial/ 2) and do not have a strong dependence on the mass of the parent group.
