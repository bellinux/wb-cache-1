5|$|Birth {{control is}} another consideration: women with SCI {{are usually not}} {{prescribed}} oral contraceptives since the hormones in them {{increase the risk of}} blood clots, for which people with SCI are already at elevated risk. Intrauterine devices could have dangerous complications that <b>could</b> <b>go</b> undetected if sensation is reduced. Diaphrams that require something to be inserted into the vagina are not usable by people with poor hand function. An option of choice for women is for partners to use condoms.|$|E

The last three battalions of the 1st Infantry Division, the 2nd Infantry Division, the 12th Ranger Group, and about 3,000 freshly trained soldiers from the Hoa Cam Training Camp were ordered to defend all key areas between Hoa Cam and Nuoc Man.

5|$|Leaks were noticed {{immediately}} after {{the installation of the}} topping. Harry S. Peterson Co. attempted many times to fix the leaks. In 1991, the owners contracted Trow to investigate the chronic leaking and find a solution.

5|$|The King County Superior Court {{ruled in}} April that the {{university}} was exempt from the city's landmarks-preservation ordinance and <b>could</b> <b>go</b> ahead with demolition of the More Hall Annex. While the city and preservationists appealed the decision, they allowed the demolition of the More Hall Annex to proceed by not seeking a stay that would leave them responsible for damages compensation. The decision was appealed to the Washington Supreme Court, who ruled in the city's favor, and rejected the university's claimed exemption from the city landmarks preservation ordinance.|$|E
5|$|The {{report also}} called for three {{commuter}} rail modernizations. The New Haven Railroad commuter service would get 144 EMUs, as well as signal improvements, high-level platforms, and renovated cars. The Penn Central Railroad would get 130 EMUs, high-level platforms, and electrified trackage north to the Brewster station. The Erie Lackawanna Railroad in New York State would get new equipment, and a study would be conducted {{to determine whether the}} ELRR <b>could</b> <b>go</b> to Pennsylvania Station. All of these improvements were to extend into Phase II of the project.|$|E

A few days later, Balfour Beatty changed its plea to guilty on {{the health and safety}} charges and, on 6 September, Network Rail was found guilty of breaching health and safety law. Network Rail were fined £3.5 million while Balfour Beatty were fined £10 million. All of the manslaughter charges against the executives were dismissed by the judge.|$|E

5|$|With {{forest fires}} {{continuing}} to burn in neighboring Indonesia, heavy smog {{was a concern}} for the event. Unhealthy levels forced the cancellation of other events in Singapore in the week leading up to the Grand Prix.

It was later reported that the smog had lifted and that the race <b>could</b> <b>go</b> ahead without any restrictions.|$|E
5|$|After Belushi's wife Judy and Aykroyd had a {{talk with}} Belushi about his antics, the {{production}} returned to Los Angeles. Filming there again ran smoothly, until {{it came time to}} shoot the final sequence at the Hollywood Palladium. Just beforehand, Belushi fell off a borrowed skateboard and seriously injured his knee, making it unlikely he <b>could</b> <b>go</b> through with the scene, which required him to sing, dance, and do cartwheels. Wasserman persuaded the city's top orthopedic surgeon to postpone his weekend plans long enough to stop by and sufficiently anesthetize Belushi's knee, and the scene was filmed as intended.|$|E
5|$|After spring thaw in 1852, {{the elderly}} Buffalo, Oshaga, Armstrong, and four others {{set out from}} La Pointe for Washington, D.C. by birch bark canoe. Along the way, they stopped in towns and mining camps along the Michigan shore of Lake Superior, {{securing}} hundreds of signatures in support of their cause. At Sault Ste. Marie, they were held by the US Indian agent, who told them that no unauthorized Ojibwa delegations <b>could</b> <b>go</b> to Washington {{and they had to}} turn back. The men pleaded the urgency of their case and traveled to Detroit by steamship. There another Indian agent tried to stop them. Once allowed to proceed, they sailed through Lake Erie to Buffalo, New York and then on to Albany and New York City.|$|E

5|$|As {{the club}} gained success in European club tournaments in the 1980s and 1990s, and {{thousands}} of IFK fans travelled to Hamburg, Barcelona, Dundee, Milan, Manchester and Munich, the supporters gained influence on the club, for example by lending money to the almost bankrupt IFK Göteborg so the team <b>could</b> <b>go</b> to Valencia to play the quarter-final in the UEFA Cup in 1982, or by being the main force behind the move back to Gamla Ullevi in 1992. The early 1990s saw a downward trend in attendance numbers, even though the club was successful on the pitch, but the trend turned in the later years of the decade and {{the first few years}} of the new millennium brought the club's highest average attendance since the early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Between May 1917 and May 1918, Mackinnon {{worked at}} the University War Hospital in Southamptom with William Fletcher from the Royal Army Medical Corps, {{focussing}} on the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} dysentery. The pair focussed on two forms of Shigella dysenteriae which had been identified by Simon Flexner and Kiyoshi Shiga. They discovered that the Flexner bacillus <b>could</b> <b>go</b> into intermission and be undetectable for periods of four to five weeks, making it very difficult to say when someone was no longer a carrier. They also found that men who were carriers of Shiga's bacillus would be prone to depression and would be no longer fit to be soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Director Harry Morris {{identified}} {{a site for}} a new ground in Bordesley Green, some three-quarters of a mile(1km) from Muntz Street towards the city centre. The site was where a brickworks once operated; the land sloped steeply down to stagnant pools, yet the stadium was constructed in under twelve months from land clearance to opening ceremony on Boxing Day 1906. Heavy snow nearly prevented the opening; volunteers had to clear pitch and terraces before the match, a goalless draw against Middlesbrough, <b>could</b> <b>go</b> ahead. The ground is reputed to have been cursed by gypsies evicted from the site; although gypsies {{are known to have}} camped nearby, there is no contemporary evidence for their eviction by the club.|$|E
5|$|Historical markers {{concerning}} Hines' exploits have occasionally included mistaken information. The historical marker {{placed by}} the Indiana Civil War Centennial Commission in 1963 {{in the vicinity}} of Derby, Perry County, Indiana, to memorialize Hines' entry into Indiana states that Hines invaded Indiana in 1862, although he actually did so in 1863. In addition, a marker by the Confederate Monument of Bowling Green in Bowling Green's Fairview Cemetery says that Hines died before he <b>could</b> <b>go</b> to the dedication ceremony in 1876, when in reality he died in 1898 and is buried a few hundred feet away.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Bernd Eichinger of Constantin Film {{acquired}} the film {{rights of the}} Fantastic Four from Marvel Comics. In 1992, Eichinger hired Roger Corman to produce a low-budget film {{in order to keep}} the rights. In 1994, the adaptation, titled The Fantastic Four, had its trailer released to theaters, and its cast and director went on a promotional tour, however the film was not officially released. The film was accused of being an ashcan copy, meaning it was only made to keep the license. Stan Lee and Eichinger stated that the actors had no idea of the situation, instead believing they were creating a proper release. Marvel Comics paid in exchange for the film's negative, so 20th Century Fox <b>could</b> <b>go</b> ahead with the big-budget adaptation. While the film was never released to theaters and home-video, it was released by bootleg video distributors.|$|E
