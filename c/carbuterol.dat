40|$|Abstract: A {{series of}} {{cationic}} drug-like substances with distinct basicity, hydrogen-bonding ability, and hydrophobicity, including three catecholamines, two beta-agonists, and thirteen beta-blockers, was successfully detected in a capillary electrophoresis system using an end-capillary coupled potentiometric sensor {{consisting of a}} PVC-based liquid membrane deposited directly on a 100 m diameter copper rod. The electrophoretic separation was performed on a 72 cm× 75 m id uncoated fused-silica capillary with an acidic background electrolyte containing phosphoric acid in a water-acetonitrile mixture, pH* 2. 8. Samples were injected electrokinetically at 5. 0 kV for 10 s and a running voltage of 19. 5 kV was applied. Excluding the bufuralol/practolol pair, baseline separation of all substances was achieved in the developed CE system within 9 minutes. A linear relationship (R 2 0. 8752) between {{the sensitivity of the}} applied potentiometric detector and the parameter log P characterising the hydrophobicity of the analytes was demonstrated. The best observable limits of detection (LODs) were obtained for the highly hydrophobic substances, i. e. bufuralol (8. 10 × 10 - 8 M injected concentration, S/N = 3), propranolol, alprenolol, and clenbuterol (ca. 1. 10 × 10 - 7 M). In the case of hydrophilic catecholamines and <b>carbuterol</b> their LODs with potentiometric detection were lowered by a factor of almost one thousand, reaching a value of 6. 6 × 10 - 5 M...|$|E
