5|$|In {{contrast}} to the forelimbs, the three-toed hindlimbs were long and thick, supporting the body in a bipedal posture. The long, heavy tail served as a <b>counterweight</b> to the head and torso and placed {{the center of gravity}} over the hips.|$|E
5|$|Traction trebuchet: The {{earliest}} type of trebuchet catapult was the traction trebuchet, developed {{first in}} China by the 5th or 4th century BC, {{the beginning of}} the Warring States period (403–221 BC); to operate the trebuchet, a team of men pulled on ropes attached to the butt of the shorter segment of a long wooden beam separated by a rotating axle fixed to a base framework, allowing the longer segment of the beam to lunge forward and use its sling to hurl a missile; by the 9th century a hybrid of the traction and <b>counterweight</b> trebuchet, employing manpower and a pivoting weight, was used in the Middle East, Mediterranean Basin, and Northern Europe; by the 12th century, the full-fledged <b>counterweight</b> trebuchet was developed under the Ayyubid dynasty of Islamic Syria and Egypt (described by Mardi bin Ali al-Tarsusi) and used in the Third Crusade; by the 13th century, the <b>counterweight</b> trebuchet found its way into Song Dynasty (960–1279) China via the Mongol invaders under Kublai Khan (r. 1260–1294) who used it in the Siege of Xiangyang (1267–1273).|$|E

5|$|Located at the {{southwest}} corner of Ellis Avenue and 55th Street, the Ratner Center has an award-winning design that substitutes a complex external mast and <b>counterweight</b> system for interior support devices to allow for large open-space areas inside the building. Cesar Pelli & Associates Inc. was credited as the design architect and OWP/P was the architect of record.|$|E
5|$|The Welles Declaration linked U.S. {{policy towards}} the Baltic {{states with the}} Stimson Doctrine, which did not {{recognize}} Japanese, German and Italian occupations during the 1930s. It broke with Wilsonian policies that had supported a strong Russian presence as a <b>counterweight</b> to German power. During the Cold War, the U.S. used the Baltic issue {{as a point of}} leverage in U.S.-Soviet relations.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{studies of}} {{different}} groups in Wilhelmine Germany have all {{contributed to a}} new view of the period. Although the Junkers did, indeed, continue to control the officer corps, they did not dominate social, political, and economic matters {{as much as the}} Sonderweg theorists had hypothesized. Eastern Junker power had a <b>counterweight</b> in the western provinces {{in the form of the}} Grand Bourgeoisie and in the growing professional class of bureaucrats, teachers, professors, doctors, lawyers, scientists, etc.|$|E

5000|$|After nearly {{another year}} passed, the bascule neared completion. Part {{of the issue}} was the bascule span's <b>counterweights.</b> The <b>counterweights</b> needed to have a density of 265 lb per , or about 5000 ST in total. Usually, large {{concrete}} <b>counterweights</b> would be used, but there was so little space inside and beneath the bridge {{that there was not}} enough space. Scrap steel punchings and iron ore (from a Swedish cargo ship) were crushed to a mostly uniform size and added to the concrete to create a density of 271 lb per [...] The span could open in 60 to 90 seconds.|$|R
5|$|In 1975, the United States was {{completing}} a retreat from Vietnam. A staunchly anti-communist Indonesia was {{considered by the}} United States to be an essential <b>counterweight,</b> and friendly relations with the Indonesian government were considered {{more important than a}} decolonisation process in East Timor. The United States also wanted to maintain its access to deep water straits running through Indonesia for undetectable submarine passage between the Indian and Pacific oceans.|$|E
5|$|The 1830s and 1840s saw romantic {{nationalism}} {{inspire the}} Croatian National Revival, {{a political and}} cultural campaign advocating the unity of all South Slavs in the empire. Its primary focus was {{the establishment of a}} standard language as a <b>counterweight</b> to Hungarian, along with the promotion of Croatian literature and culture. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 Croatia sided with the Austrians, Ban Josip Jelačić helping defeat the Hungarian forces in 1849, and ushering a period of Germanization policy.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{was perched}} {{at the end}} of a thick, S-shaped neck, and a long, heavy tail acted as a <b>counterweight</b> to balance out the head and torso, with the center of mass over the hips. Tyrannosaurids are known for their proportionately very small two-fingered forelimbs, {{although}} remnants of a vestigial third digit are sometimes found. Tarbosaurus had the shortest forelimbs compared to its body size, while Daspletosaurus had the longest.|$|E

50|$|The {{crankshaft}} {{was supported}} by five main bearings with thrust taken at the middle bearing. 1991 and 1992 engines had a different crankshaft than 1993 and later engines. 1993 and later crankshafts had ten degrees advanced reluctor ring slots to aid in startability. 1991 to 1998 crankshafts incorporated 4 <b>counterweights.</b> 1999 to 2002 crankshafts incorporated 8 <b>counterweights.</b>|$|R
5|$|After {{devolution}} {{began to}} take place {{in other parts of the}} United Kingdom it was planned that referendums for the regions of England would take place for their own elected regional assemblies as a <b>counterweight.</b> London accepted in 1998: the London Assembly was created two years later. However, when the proposal was rejected by the northern England devolution referendums, 2004 in the North East, further referendums were cancelled. The regional assemblies outside London were abolished in 2010, and their functions transferred to respective Regional Development Agencies and a new system of Local authority leaders' boards.|$|E
5|$|Daspletosaurus {{shared the}} same body form as other tyrannosaurids, with a short, S-shaped neck {{supporting}} the massive skull. It walked on its two thick hindlimbs, which ended in four-toed feet, although the first digit (the hallux) did not contact the ground. In contrast, the forelimbs were extremely small and bore only two digits, although Daspletosaurus had the longest forelimbs in proportion to body size of any tyrannosaurid. A long, heavy tail served as a <b>counterweight</b> to the head and torso, with {{the center of gravity}} over the hips.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Nasser {{sought to}} firmly {{establish}} Egypt {{as the leader}} of the Arab world and to promote a second revolution in Egypt with the purpose of merging Islamic and socialist thinking. To achieve this, he initiated several reforms to modernize al-Azhar, which serves as the de facto leading authority in Sunni Islam, and to ensure its prominence over the Muslim Brotherhood and the more conservative Wahhabism promoted by Saudi Arabia. Nasser had used al-Azhar's most willing ulema (scholars) as a <b>counterweight</b> to the Brotherhood's Islamic influence, starting in 1953.|$|E

50|$|The {{machine shop}} then determines if the proper {{rotational}} {{balance of the}} re-manufactured crankshafts is achieved. In the engine the crankshaft, pistons and rods all in a constant rotation. The <b>counterweights</b> are designed to offset {{the weight of the}} rod and the pistons in the engine. When in motion the kinetic energy and the sum of all forces should be equal to zero on all moving parts. If the re-manufactured crankshaft <b>counterweights</b> are imbalanced it adds additional stress on other components of the engine. The technician should then make sure the internal balance and the external balance of the crankshaft <b>counterweights</b> are properly aligned.|$|R
5|$|In January 1957, the US {{adopted the}} Eisenhower Doctrine and pledged {{to prevent the}} spread of {{communism}} and its perceived agents in the Middle East. Although Nasser was an opponent of communism in the region, his promotion of pan-Arabism was viewed as a threat by pro-Western states in the region. Eisenhower tried to isolate Nasser and reduce his regional influence by attempting to transform King Saud into a <b>counterweight.</b> Also in January, the elected Jordanian prime minister and Nasser supporter Sulayman al-Nabulsi brought Jordan into a military pact with Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|Michigan Avenue Bridge is a double-leaf, double-deck, fixed <b>counterweight,</b> {{trunnion}} bascule bridge. It was {{engineered by}} the Chicago Department of Public Works, Bureau of Engineering; Edward H. Bennett was the consulting architect and William A. Mulcahy {{the chief engineer}} of construction. At the time of construction it {{was believed to be}} the first double-deck bridge ever built to have roadway on both levels; faster non-commercial traffic using the upper deck and slower commercial traffic that served the various industries and docks in the vicinity of the river using the lower deck.|$|E
5|$|The Romans did not, however, remove Nabis {{from the}} Spartan throne. Even though Sparta was a {{landlocked}} and effectively powerless state, the Romans wanted an independent Sparta {{to act as}} a <b>counterweight</b> against the growing Achaean League. Nabis' allegiance was secured {{by the fact that he}} had to surrender five hostages, amongst them his son, Armenas. The Romans did not restore the exiles, wishing to avoid internal strife in Sparta. They did, however, allow any woman who was married to an ex-helot but whose husband was in exile to join him.|$|E
5000|$|Unfortunately, a 90° V6 cannot use {{the same}} {{technique}} that balances an even firing 90° crossplane V8 engine; rotating the middle two cranks to 90° from the outer two, using extra-heavy <b>counterweights</b> on the crankshaft to offset the rocking motion, and then using {{the mass of the}} pistons in the other cylinder bank at 90° to counteract the side-to-side rotation that the heavy <b>counterweights</b> would otherwise cause (resulting in an engine that is in perfect primary and secondary balance, albeit one with very heavy crankshaft <b>counterweights</b> and uneven firing intervals into the exhaust headers, resulting in the familiar V8 [...] "burbling" [...] exhaust note).|$|R
5000|$|Spreader plates {{serve to}} {{maintain}} consistent spacing between the arbor rods to ensure reliable containment of the <b>counterweights</b> under normal operating conditions. Also, {{in the event}} of a [...] "runaway" [...] (loss of control of an unbalanced lineset), the spreader plates will prevent the arbor rods from bending outward, and thus releasing the <b>counterweights</b> upon arbor impact at the end of its travel.|$|R

5|$|Bruce and Hughes clashed in both {{style and}} ideology. Bruce found Hughes' {{management}} of the government capricious and chaotic, and felt little was accomplished in Cabinet or in party meetings so long as Hughes headed them. But {{he served as a}} strong <b>counterweight</b> to the domineering Hughes, resisting several of his more expensive proposals or acting as the voice of reason to talk Hughes down from several of his more outlandish ideas. His tenure would ultimately be short, presiding over just one budget in 1922, which was conservative and tax-cutting. The Opposition criticised the budget for its failure to limit rising government spending and indebtedness. The budget included many concessions to rural interests and the recently formed Country Party, which appeared as a major threat to Nationalist Party dominance going into the 1922 elections in December. Yet Bruce endeared himself to many of his colleagues with his amiable personal style, his forceful voice in Cabinet against Hughes, and his conservative views, which were more in line with the majority of the party.|$|E
5|$|Later, on 19 June, Chief of Staff al-Hariri led a {{high-ranking}} delegation that included Prime Minister al-Bitar, Aflaq and Education Minister Sami Droubi to Algeria {{for a state}} visit. While al-Hariri was away, the Committee used the opportunity to undertake a purge of about 30 elite officers—mostly political independents—under al-Hariri's command. Al-Hariri was ordered to take a direct flight to the Syrian embassy in the United States, where he was reassigned as the embassy's military attache. Instead, he returned to Syria via a flight to Beirut on 23 June to protest the Committee's move against him. Unsuccessful, he left the country for France in a self-imposed exile on 8 July. The Committee's virtual ousting of al-Hariri was {{to the chagrin of}} al-Bitar, who viewed al-Hariri as the last military <b>counterweight</b> able to check the Committee's domination over his government.|$|E
5|$|Possible {{motivations for}} this {{complete}} rebuilding by Al-Adil include the damage the old citadel may have sustained from earthquakes in 1200 and 1201 {{and the threat}} that other Ayyubid princes continued to pose toward Al-Adil. The most likely motivation is that the defences of the old citadel became obsolete due to the introduction in the 12th century of the <b>counterweight</b> trebuchet, a siege engine easily capable of reducing thick stone walls to rubble. The new citadel introduced {{a number of important}} changes to the defensive system, including higher and thicker walls, a wide moat surrounding the citadel, and numerous closely spaced, high, massive towers. Unlike the older towers, these were square rather than round in design. The towers contained platforms on which trebuchets could be placed. Due to their high position, these trebuchets could outrange enemy artillery and thereby prevent them from breaching the walls.|$|E
