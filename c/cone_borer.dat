5000|$|Eucosma tocullionana, {{the white}} pine <b>cone</b> <b>borer,</b> is a moth of the Tortricidae family. It {{is found in}} North America from Minnesota to Quebec, south in the Appalachian Mountains to {{northern}} Georgia.|$|E
40|$|The {{compound}} eyes of four Mexican cone borers: Conophthorus ponderosae Hopkins, C. conicolens Wood, C. michoacanae Wood and C. teocotum Wood {{were studied}} and compared by main {{internal and external}} structures as are: number of facets, eye length, ventral eye width, dorsal eye width, facet diameter, primary and secondary pigments diameter, ommatidium length and cone length, where this last seem be larger in females than males; It is described the main characteristics of dioptric apparatus and photoreceptor layer. For 2 <b>cone</b> <b>borer</b> species studied. In general all the Conophthorus species showed identically kidney-shaped eyes where the number of ommatidia or facets quantified no differed significantly between species (P= 0. 0149) and sex, except for the case of C. teocotum W; the other parameters or characteristics compared are too seem for all species group studied. It was described that the general structures of the dioptric apparatus and photoreceptor layer for C. ponderosae H and C. conicolens W, where were identified the presence of 8 rhabdomeres, confirms {{the fact that this}} number of receptors is common in scolitids, which give them the possibility of a UV-sensitive navigation system added to a green sensitive motion detecting their hosts. ...|$|E
40|$|In three study {{sites in}} the Michoacan State, Mexico, we tested five {{behavioral}} chemicals: Pityol, 4 Allylanisole, Verbenone (3 M MEC), Conophthorin and Hexenol, in several field trials mixed at six combinations or treatments as posible repelents for females of Conophthorus conicolens W and Conophthorus teocotum W. Beetle-host tree combinations included these two cone bores species on cones of Pinus pseudostrobus (Lidl), the first, and on Pinus teocote (Schl and Cham) the second ones, baited previously with five semiochemicals, including the only case of Verbenone (3 M Mec) which was sprayed alone on healthy green cones of second year growing free from the presence of cone borers and previously to fly period of scolitids as at all other treatments. Cones baited with the combination of semiochemicals P+ 4 AA+V besides these sprayed with Verbenone were less attacked and obviously distinctibily. Moreover, cones baited only with Pityol and adding Verbenone as a spray periodically, the effect of treatment was inefficient {{to protect them from}} boring by Conophthorus conicolens W, whereas these baited with P+ 4 AA synergized the presence of <b>cone</b> <b>borer</b> females; The combination of all these semiochemicals and added with Conophthorin (P+ 4 AA+C) and Hexenol (P+ 4 AA+H) had inconsistent results, although for this last case, Hexenol apparently was synergist when is mixed with Pityol and 4 AA, to prevent from attack by Conophthorus teocotum W. The best results of study subject were obtained with the combined treatment Pityol + 4 AA+Verbenone, and significately better spraying as alone as Verbenone and repelling C. conicolens W and C. teocotum W. ...|$|E
