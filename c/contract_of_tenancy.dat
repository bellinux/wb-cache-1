50|$|The LCC {{built the}} estate to rehouse people from London's East End, due to slum clearance. However, the {{residents}} were almost all relatively prosperous working class, such as factory workers and busmen. At the time everyone marvelled at having indoor toilets {{and a private}} garden, although the sash windows were extremely draughty, there was no insulation in the attics, and {{during the winter months}} very few people could afford enough coal to heat the bedrooms. The toilet, bath tap and a tap in the kitchen over a copper boiler which was used for both washing clothes and heating bath water were all fed from a reservoir tank in the attic which invariably froze on winter mornings leaving the toilets unusable. One clause in the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenancy</b> stipulated that children born to parents living on the estate would not be housed by the LCC and when the time came for them to establish their own homes, the relevant local authority would be expected to provide housing.|$|E
50|$|In {{the centuries}} since 1449 the law {{south of the}} border has {{certainly}} gone beyond Scots law in the statutory regulation of leases; but Scotland must surely have been the first to confer rights beyond those conferred by the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>tenancy</b> itself, which prior to 1449 would have been binding only on the parties to it. But the effect of the 1449 Act (which is still on the statute book and which by modern standards is admirably concise, running only to some six lines) is that, where ownership of a property subject to an existing tenancy changes hands, the new owner is bound by the lease and must allow the tenant not only to remain in possession but to do so at the original rent. Thanks to the Act, the tenant has obtained, not only a personal right enforceable against the original landlord, but a real right enforceable against the landlord's singular successor.|$|E
50|$|In 1815, van de Capellen {{was made}} the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, {{where he had}} to deal with both a native {{rebellion}} and a money shortage. In fact, during his tenure in Java, his power was largely ceremonial as his adjunct, Cornelis Theodorus Elout, had much of the actual power. The King decreed freedom of cultivation and trade, and the slave trade was prohibited. Van der Capellen was less progressive than other commissioners; after they left in 1819, he increased the power of native chiefs. He protected the Government’s system of coffee plantations by not allowing European planters to settle in the Priangan area of West Java, nor would he let Europeans or Chinese trade there. In 1824 he cancelled <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> land <b>tenancy,</b> forcing the native chiefs to pay back the advances they had received by further exploiting the cultivators. This caused unrest in Yogyakarta. As the post-war boom in coffee and sugar exports faded, Javanese ports went into deficit. Money was spent quelling riots outside of Java in Maluku (Moluccas), Kalimantan (Borneo), Sulawesi (Celebes), Palembang, and on the west coast of Sumatra. Van der Capellen made a tour in 1824 and abolished the hated limit on the number of spice trees. Muntinghe’s proposal for a national company under King Willem was adopted in 1825 as the Netherlands Trading Society with 37,000,000 guilders in capital and paying 4.5 percent dividends. Hard-pressed cultivators had to pay taxes in money and turned to Chinese moneylenders.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{determinants}} <b>of</b> agrarian <b>tenancy</b> <b>contract</b> choice and its implication on productivity in prewar Japan. Rapid agricultural growth under extensive tenancy relationships in prewar Japan was achieved with {{the prevalence of}} a unique rent reduction contract, which was more efficient than a share tenancy or a pure fixed-rent <b>contract</b> in terms <b>of</b> provision of incentives and risk-sharing. Despite its potential efficiency, a rent reduction contract incurred substantial transaction costs, which may have inhibited its adoption outside Japan. The prevalence <b>of</b> this <b>contract</b> in prewar Japan was likely due {{to the presence of}} villages that reduced such costs through informal governance <b>of</b> the private <b>tenancy</b> relationships. We found quantitatively at the village level that the choice <b>of</b> <b>tenancy</b> <b>contract</b> in prewar Iwate prefecture was affected by risk and possibly transaction costs. Furthermore, a sign of Marshallian inefficiency was found at the prefecture level, where the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>tenancy</b> and productivity is negatively correlated and such inefficiency was worse in prefectures with a greater proportion <b>of</b> share <b>tenancy.</b> ...|$|R

FACS Housing uses tenancy law variously as an attempted adjunct to supportive modes of "working with clients" and, on the other hand, as an instrument of authoritative control; though in both regards, tenancy law is a heavy, blunt instrument.

40|$|We {{revisit the}} {{classical}} question of productivity implications <b>of</b> sharecropping <b>tenancy,</b> {{in the context}} <b>of</b> <b>tenancy</b> reforms (Operation Barga) in West Bengal, India studied previously by Banerjee, Gertler and Ghatak (JPE 2002).

We continue to find significant positive effects <b>of</b> lagged village <b>tenancy</b> registration rates. But the direct effects on tenant farms are overshadowed by spillover effects on non-tenant farms. The effects <b>of</b> <b>tenancy</b> reform are also dominated by those of input supply programs and irrigation expenditures of local governments.

40|$|Most of {{the discussions}} <b>of</b> farm <b>tenancy</b> have dealt {{primarily}} with the economic condition of the tenant class, the maintenance of soil fertility under tenant farming, and the more general and sociological aspects <b>of</b> the so-called <b>tenancy</b> problem.
