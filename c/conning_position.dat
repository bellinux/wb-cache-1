The British {{doctrine}} on how to engage ships like Admiral Graf Spee had been developed by Harwood in 1936 and, following this procedure, Exeter operated as a division on her own, Achilles and Ajax as the other, to split the fire of the German ship. They were only partially successful as the ship concentrated her main armament of six [...] guns on Exeter and her secondary armament of eight [...] guns on the light cruisers.

Spitefuls length overall was , her beam was [...] and her draught was [...] Her light displacement was 400tons (406.4tonnes). In common with similar Royal Navy ships of the time, her forecastle was of the [...] "turtle-back" [...] type with a rounded top: this design was intended to keep the forecastle clear of sea water, but in practice had the adverse effect of digging a ship's bow into the sea when it was rough, thereby making ships lose speed, besides making them [...] "wet and uncomfortable". Wetness was mitigated by screening across {{the rear of the}} forecastle and around the forward gun position, below which was the enclosed conning tower. A foremast stood behind the <b>conning</b> <b>position</b> and was fitted with a derrick. The crew numbered 63officers and men, for whom the accommodation on this type of ship was [...] "very cramped; usually the captain had a small cabin but... other officers lived in the wardroom."

50|$|During {{the first}} centuries after Christ, {{various forms of}} chiliasm (millennialism) were {{to be found in}} the Church, both East and West.

The Church never took a formal position on the issue at any of the ecumenical councils, and thus both pro and <b>con</b> <b>positions</b> remained consistent with orthodoxy.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the impact of}} environmental policies on international competitiveness of industries. Two positions are taken in the current debate on this issue.

A survey of empirical studies concludes that there is no general clear evidence for neither a positive nor a negative impact of environmental policy on international competitiveness...|$|R
40|$|During {{election}} campaigns, {{political parties}} deliver statements on salient {{issues in the}} news media, which are called issue positions. This article conceptualizes issue positions as a valued and longitudinal two-mode network of parties by issues. The network is valued because parties pronounce pro or <b>con</b> <b>positions</b> on issues in more or less extreme ways. It is longitudinal because the media report new statements of parties on issues each new day. In political science, issue positions are often assumed to be stable throughout the election campaign but this article shows that parties adjust their issue positions systematically to the issue positions of other parties. Applying concepts from social network analysis, notably structural balance and transitivity, we analyze {{the evolution of the}} network of issue positions showing that issue positions adopted previously by other parties as well as previous reports on support and criticism among parties have substantial and statistically significant effects on subsequent issue positions. Our dynamic adjustment model is estimated by means of a two-mode network autoregression model with cross-nested random effects.

40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{this meeting}} was an {{adjournment}} of that document with present {{state of the art}} evidence-based literature and experience. A thesis supporting a correlation between posture and occlusion was opposed to an oppositional position on the lack of a correlation (the pro and <b>con</b> <b>positions).</b> Results: After thorough review of the current literature, the committee developed a new document (consensus). The committee noted that current literature is poor both for quality and for quantity on this topic; nevertheless, it was observed, that conservative treatment might have a beneficial role in the treatment of postural and occlusal disorders. However, {{because of the lack of}} evidence in favor of any definitive treatment or evidence-based therapies, treatment cannot be invasive and should be limited to only conservative and reversible modalities. Conclusions: It was recognized by the committee that conservative, non-invasive, and reversible treatment may be beneficial for some patients, and treatment is not contraindicated, but no treatment can be provided unless a working diagnosis is arrived before instituting a treatment plan. For this reason, the updated document of this 2008 Consensus Symposium exhibits a significant improvement for guiding the clinicians while compared with 1997 position in that it suggests that there may be a rationale for conservative treatment for certain, well-defined conditions. The definition of posture in the new document encompasses the neurophysiological basis of posture and gait, and emphasizes that posture is now regarded as controlled by a dynamic, multifaceted system...|$|R

40|$|This report {{explores the}} {{development}} of interactive, web-based activities in a Computer Science course for majors that meets {{the requirements of the}} Computer Science Accreditation Commission (CSAC) for a course in computer ethics and social impact. Starting from a project to develop a digital library to support a longstanding course in "Professionalism in Computing", this web-based version has steadily evolved into a modular resource that permits teachers at other institutions to construct their own versions of an ethics and social impact course. For the past two years the passive nature of the digital library approach has been revised to incorporate active-learning concepts. While maintaining the belief that the teaching of ethics and social impact still requires some classroom interaction between participants and collaborative development activities, each topical module has been augmented by on-line active-learning plans that involve pre-class, in-class, and post-class projects. The preclass activities allow participants to gain a basic understanding of the topic prior to the class, to review assigned readings from the library, to surf the web for additional resources, and possibly to participate in an opinion survey that can be used as the basis for an in-class discussion. Post-class projects involve the application of learned concepts to the lives of the participants and the institution. An on-line debate system that emulates an "Oxford Union" style debate, forcing participants to clearly take pro or <b>con</b> <b>positions</b> on arguments, {{is an integral part of}} the course, though also available as an independent module.

40|$|The {{relatively}} sudden boom in {{shale gas}} {{production in the}} United States using hydraulic fracturing has provoked increasingly intense political conflict. The debate over fracking and shale gas production has become polarized very quickly, {{in part because of}} the size of the economic and environmental stakes. This polarized debate fits a familiar template in American environmental law, pitting “cool analysis” against “moral outrage. ” Opponents of fracking have generally framed their arguments in moral or ethical terms, while systematic research is beginning to build a more careful and nuanced understanding of the risks associated with shale gas production (though the record is far from complete). All of which makes the question of how to produce shale gas “responsibly” – corporate social responsibility being the focus of this symposium – very difficult to answer. This essay argues that: (i) because shale gas production entails difficult to measure and unevenly distributed costs and benefits, there is no clear responsible (read: ethically preferable) set of limitations that we ought to impose on shale gas production; and (ii) moral outrage is obscuring (or influencing perceptions of) empirical facts in the shale gas policy debate. More specifically, well-established behavioral heuristics – particularly, confirmation biases and the cultural cognition of risk – are impeding the development of a common understanding of the empirical facts necessary to guide policymaking. Recognizing this, policymakers must resist political pressures and work that much harder to ground their decisions in empirically-demonstrated facts – namely, those produced by sources that are less susceptible to these heuristics and biases. Thus, information generated by rigorous, empirical analyses performed by academic or government sources ought to be credited over anecdotes or studies associated with industry or NGOs that have staked out a clear pro or <b>con</b> <b>position</b> in the fracking debate. Indeed, responsible fracking decisions ought to consider all of the consequences of permitting, regulating or banning shale gas production, including the relative risks of shale gas production compared with the relevant energy alternatives...|$|R
