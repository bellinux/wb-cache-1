50|$|Crystals are {{sensitive}} to shock. The mechanical stress causes a short-term change in the oscillator frequency due to the stress-sensitivity of the crystal, and can introduce a permanent change of frequency due to shock-induced changes of mounting and internal stresses (if the elastic limits of the mechanical parts are exceeded), desorption of contamination from the crystal surfaces, or change in parameters of the oscillator circuit. High magnitudes of shocks may tear the crystals off their mountings (especially {{in the case of}} large low-frequency crystals suspended on thin wires), or cause cracking of the crystal. Crystals free of surface imperfections are highly shock-resistant; <b>chemical</b> <b>polishing</b> can produce crystals able to survive tens of thousands of g.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the Shore A hardness and color stability of two soft lining materials after thermocycling and when <b>chemical</b> <b>polishing</b> was used or omitted. Two acrylic-based soft lining materials were tested: Coe-Soft and Soft Confort, 14 specimens were made for each material. They were distributed in four groups according to the treatment performed. The specimens were thermocycled (1000 cycles) and half of the group submitted to <b>chemical</b> <b>polishing</b> (methyl methacrylate). Shore A hardness was determined and color stability was calculated by means of Commission International de l'Eclairage Lab uniform color scale using a spectrophotometer, the measurements were made immediately after deflasked, <b>chemical</b> <b>polishing</b> and thermocycling. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's tests were performed at p < 0. 01. Color changes (deltaE) were observed after thermocycling in both soft lining materials: Soft Confort (10. 60) showed significantly higher values than Coe-Soft (4. 57).

In this paper, an improved designed test rig is used to acquire the signals on <b>chemical</b> mechanical <b>polishing.</b> The shear force and temperature-rise are measured during <b>chemical</b> mechanical <b>polishing</b> process. The polishing temperature is measured by T-type thermocouples screwed behind the polishing interface of the carrier.

The parameters including down force, rotation speed, particle size and volume flow rate of slurry are investigated. The experimental results provide a good index to end-point-detection.

The results indicate that after <b>chemical</b> <b>polishing,</b> {{there is still a}} high Ni concentration {{on the surface of the}} NiTi SMA. On the other hand, electropolishing can form a thin surface titanium oxide film (about 10  nm thickness) with depleted Ni. In addition to the TiO 2 phase, some titanium suboxides (TiO and Ti 2 O 3) are found in the surface film. Compared to <b>chemical</b> <b>polishing,</b> electropolishing can more effectively mitigate out-diffusion of Ni ions and the wettability, blood compatibility, and thromboresistance are also better.

40|$|Micro-structures of RF {{surfaces}} in the electron-beam-weld (EBW) regions of niobium samples were studied. These surfaces were polished with different techniques, namely buffered <b>chemical</b> <b>polish</b> (1 : 1 : 2 BCP) and electrolytic polish (EP). It {{was found that}} there are three distinctively different regions near the EBW, characterized by different grain sizes, shapes, and orientations. Strikingly, we found grain boundaries within the EBW are nicely lined up so that they form an angle of about 60 degree with respect to the weld seam. Upon being polished with BCP, these grain boundaries evolve into micro-steps with sharp edges, due to preferential etching of different crystallographic planes. There is evidence that the step height increases up to possibly more than 30 microns with repeated <b>chemical</b> <b>polish.</b> In contrast to the result with BCP, dimensions of surface irregularities were reduced with EP and sharp edges were rounded off.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} <b>chemical</b> <b>polishing</b> on the internal adaptation of complete denture bases fabricated with Veracril® resin and polymerized by either the conventional (C) or microwave (M) techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six groups (n= 6 /group) were tested: 1) C + no polishing (CO); 2) C + <b>chemical</b> <b>polishing</b> (CQ); 3) C + immersion in hot water at 75 ºC (CW); 4) M + no polishing (MO); 5) M + <b>chemical</b> <b>polishing</b> (MQ); and 6) M + immersion in hot water at 75 ºC (MW). Internal adaptation immediately after the polishing treatment and after 30 days of storage in water at 37 ºC was evaluated by weighing a vinyl polysiloxane film reproducing the gap between resin base and metallic master model, using a precision scale. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey test and paired Student's t test, at a significance level of 0. 05. RESULTS: No significant difference in immediate adaptation was found {{as a function of}} technique, polishing treatment, or interaction of technique/polishing. After 30 days, adaptation means (g) were: CO= 2. 46 ± 0. 32 a; CQ= 3. 40 ± 0. 23 d; CW= 3. 14 ± 0. 22 c; MO= 3. 23 ± 0. 37 c, d; MQ= 3. 41 ± 0. 47 d; MW= 2. 81 ± 0. 33 b (means followed by different letters are statistically different at alpha= 0. 05).

For pickling, three acidic solutions at 10 % volume; that are tartaric, phosphoric and oxalic acid have been used. For <b>chemical</b> <b>polishing</b> a solution of phosphoric acid 10 % volume containing MnHPO 4 for different weight per litre was tested. Concerning pickling, the treatment duration time is longer for the organic acid solutions to pickle the same weight percentage of the coating oxide.
