25|$|Having contributed {{directly}} to L'Indépendence Roumaines success (it became the second-most popular newspaper by 1897), Claymoor made a return trip to Paris in 1899. He died in Bucharest on June 12, 1903, after falling {{down in front}} of L'Indépendence Roumaine office, just as he was bringing in his latest <b>Carnet</b> chronicle. Although he is sometimes assumed to have died there, on the spot, he actually did so at his sister's home. The ultimate cause of death was a peptic ulcer. Claymoor was buried at Bellu cemetery, Plot 17. His objets d'art were auctioned off by January 1904, but the Almanach du High-Life continued to be published over the following years.|$|E
25|$|Another {{vigorous}} {{supporter of}} Cubism was the art dealer and collector Léonce Rosenberg. By {{the end of}} 1918—filling in the vacuum left {{in the wake of}} D.-H. Kahnweiler's imposed exile—Rosenberg purchased works by almost all of the Cubists. His defense of Cubism would prove to be longer-lasting and wider-ranging than Reverdy's. His first tactical maneuver was to address a letter to Le <b>Carnet</b> de la Semaine denying the chimerical claim made by Vauxcelles that both Picasso and Gris had defected. Much more poignant and difficult to combat, however, was his second tactical maneuver: a succession of prominent Cubist exhibitions held at the Galerie de L'Effort Moderne, in Rosenber's Hôtel particulier, 19, rue de la Baume, located in the elegant and stylishly fashionable 8th arrondissement of Paris.|$|E

2500|$|Writer George Costescu {{describes}} L'Indépendence Roumaine as {{adhering to}} [...] "Western journalistic norms", and notes Claymoor's role in pioneering locally {{the genre of}} [...] "fashion reports": [...] "the crafty Mihail Văcărescu-Claymoor chronicled all the political and diplomatic receptions, all artistic reunions and balls, concerts, fêtes and weddings involving Bucharest's elite families." [...] The concept was criticized by anti-elitists. In 1912, the left-wing George Ranetti argued that <b>Carnet</b> du High-life would have been [...] "more or less justified in a city like Paris", but asked: [...] "what point could it serve in Romania?" [...] In {{the absence of an}} aristocratic culture, Claymoor only [...] "fed the vanities" [...] of a commercial [...] "plutocracy". Similarly, Bulei sees the <b>Carnet</b> as copying from Le Figaro and Le Gaulois, [...] "but with its Dâmbovița relish." [...] He suggests that some of the chronicles—for instance one describing Zoe Sturdza, wife of the politician D. A. Sturdza—were unintentionally amusing.|$|E

2500|$|Claymoor {{earned more}} respect as a pioneer cinema critic: in 1896–1897, {{he was among}} the first to chronicle the {{earliest}} Romanian film shows and, as film historian Dinu-Ioan Nicola argues, had [...] "surprising critical intuitions." [...] Having been present at a screening of Paul Menu's [...] "Romanian vistas" [...] in May 1897, Claymoor prophesied that [...] "cinema will reestablish truth and the sincerity of our lives will be transmitted over the ages, beyond ourselves. To us it is entertainment. To future generations, it will be a priceless document". As argued by one anonymous witness, Claymoor was personally involved in film promotion, making excuses for the technical difficulties and delays. His <b>Carnet,</b> [...] "I believe, has reached the peak of its glory during these days." ...|$|E
