40|$|This article {{proposes a}} model {{explaining}} how family control/influence {{in an organization}} affects individual stakeholders’ perceptions <b>of</b> <b>benevolence.</b> The model suggests two effects. First, based on socioemotional wealth research, we propose that family control/influence positively affects stakeholders’ perceptions <b>of</b> <b>benevolence</b> through the benevolent behavior that the organization shows toward its stakeholders. However, this effect can be negatively influenced if the family’s socioemotional wealth goals in terms of “Family control and influence” and/or “Renewal of family bonds to the firm through dynastic succession” are at risk. Second, we argue that family control/influence, {{to the extent that}} it is perceivable to the stakeholder, influences stakeholders’ perceptions <b>of</b> <b>benevolence</b> through categorization processes. However, the impact of perceivable family control/influence on stakeholders’ perceptions <b>of</b> <b>benevolence</b> is not straightforward but instead hinges on a set of individual-level contingency factors of the stakeholder, such as stakeholders’ family business in-group membership, stakeholders’ secondhand category information, and stakeholders’ firsthand category information...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{view the}} <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> top {{managers}} from an integrated agency theory-trust perspective, arguing that two conditions reflecting CEO risk bearing, top management team (TMT) behavioral uncertainty and CEO vulnerability, are {{negatively related to}} a CEO's perceptions <b>of</b> TMT <b>benevolence</b> toward him-/herself, which in turn influence the protective features <b>of</b> TMT <b>contracts.</b> Model tests on data from 122 family-owned firms in Spain support our hypotheses overall. Agency theory may be enhanced by accounting for a CEO's perceptions (as principal) <b>of</b> TMT <b>benevolence</b> and for the effect of those perceptions on contracts with TMT members (as agents).

40|$|In {{the name}} <b>of</b> <b>benevolence,</b> philanthropy, and {{humanitarian}} aid, individuals, groups, and nations {{have sought to}} assist others and to redress forms of suffering and deprivation. Yet, the inherent imbalances of power between the giver and the recipient <b>of</b> this <b>benevolence</b> have called into question the motives and rationale for such assistance. This volume examines {{the evolution of the}} ideas and practices <b>of</b> <b>benevolence,</b> chiefly in the context of British imperialism, from the late 18 th century to the present. The authors consider more than a dozen examples of practical and theoretical benevolence from the anti-slavery movement of the late 18 th century to such modern activities as refugee asylum in Europe, opposition to female genital mutilation in Africa, fund raising for charities, and restoring the wetlands in southern, post-Saddam Iraq. The book offers a complex and nuanced study <b>of</b> <b>benevolence</b> that avoids simple moralistic judgments while exploring a range of ethical, political, social, and cultural issues linked with benevolent pursuits and policies...|$|R

40|$|Part 6 : AlgorithmsInternational audienceDynamic Time Warping {{algorithm}} (DTW) is {{an effective}} tool for comparing two sequences which are subject {{to some kind of}} distortion. Unlike the standard methods for comparison, it is able to deal with a different length of compared sequences or with reasonable amount of inaccuracy. For this reason, DTW has become very popular and it is widely used in many domains. One of its the biggest advantages is a possibility to specify definable amount <b>of</b> <b>benevolence</b> while evaluating similarity of two sequences. It enables to percept similarity through the eyes of domain expert, in contrast with a strict sequential comparison of opposite sequence elements. Unfortunately, such commonly used definition <b>of</b> <b>benevolence</b> cannot be applied on DTW modifications, which were created for solving specific tasks (e. g. searching the longest common subsequence). The main goal {{of this paper is to}} eliminate weaknesses of commonly used approach and to propose a new flexible mechanism for definition <b>of</b> <b>benevolence</b> applicable to modifications of original DTW...|$|R
