40|$|The agar {{dilution}} MIC {{method was}} used to test the activity of <b>cefminox,</b> a β-lactamase-stable cephamycin, compared with those of cefoxitin, cefotetan, moxalactam, ceftizoxime, cefotiam, cefamandole, cefoperazone, clindamycin, and metronidazole against 357 anaerobes. Overall, <b>cefminox</b> was the most active β-lactam, with an MIC at which 50 % of isolates are inhibited (MIC 50) of 1. 0 μg/ml and an MIC 90 of 16. 0 μg/ml. Other β-lactams were less active, with respective MIC 50 s and MIC 90 s of 2. 0 and 64. 0 μg/ml for cefoxitin, 2. 0 and 128. 0 μg/ml for cefotetan, 2. 0 and 64. 0 μg/ml for moxalactam, 4. 0 and > 128. 0 μg/ml for ceftizoxime, 16. 0 and > 128. 0 μg/ml for cefotiam, 8. 0 and > 128. 0 μg/ml for cefamandole, and 4. 0 and 128. 0 μg/ml for cefoperazone. The clindamycin MIC 50 and MIC 90 were 0. 5 and 8. 0 μg/ml, respectively, and the metronidazole MIC 50 and MIC 90 were 1. 0 and 4. 0 μg/ml, respectively. <b>Cefminox</b> was especially active against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC 90, 2. 0 μg/ml), Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (MIC 90, 4. 0 μg/ml), fusobacteria (MIC 90, 1. 0 μg/ml), peptostreptococci (MIC 90, 2. 0 μg/ml), and clostridia, including Clostridium difficile (MIC 90, 2. 0 μg/ml). Time-kill studies performed with six representative anaerobic species revealed that at the MIC all compounds except ceftizoxime were bactericidal (99. 9 % killing) against all strains after 48 h. At 24 h, only <b>cefminox</b> and cefoxitin at 4 × the MIC and cefoperazone at 8 × the MIC were bactericidal against all strains.

40|$|Many {{cephalosporin}} antibiotics {{have recently}} been invented and {{attempts have been made}} to use them clinically. The choice of which of these drugs should be used has been difficult in gynecology. The efficacies of these drugs depend on their antibacterial spectra, potencies, and concentrations in tissues. This study was designed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of various cephem antibiotics in the exudate of the retroperitoneal space that is formed after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. These cephem antibiotics were cefoxitin, cefotiam, cefotetan, cefpiramide, <b>cefminox,</b> cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefoperazone, cefmenoxime, cefbuperazone, ceftazidime, cefpimizole, flomoxef, and cefuzonam. The maximum concentrations after administration of a 1 -g dose in the exudate of the pelvic retroperitoneal space were 37. 9 micrograms/ml with <b>cefminox,</b> 30. 3 micrograms/ml with cefpimizole, 21. 6 micrograms/ml with flomoxef, 21. 5 micrograms/ml with ceftazidime, and 17. 6 micrograms/ml with cefbuperazone, which were relatively high. When selecting antibiotics for prophylactic use against infections in the retroperitoneal space after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy, on the basis of drug transfer, flomoxef, <b>cefminox,</b> cefbuperazone, ceftazidime, and cefpimizole were considered to be the drugs of first choice at a dose of 1 g...|$|E

We prospectively collected and tested all consecutive isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. from blood, urine and sputum samples between March and November 2012. The minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of 16 antibiotics {{was determined by the}} broth micro-dilution method. Overall 925 isolates were included; 211 E. coli, 207 Klebsiella spp., 153 P. aeruginosa, and 354 Acinetobacter spp. The MIC 50 and MIC 90 were high for <b>cefminox,</b> biapenem and arbekacin for all pathogens but interpretative criteria were not available. The MIC 50 was categorized as susceptible for a couple of antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenems and amikacin, for E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and P. aeruginosa. However, for Acinetobacter spp., the MIC 50 was categorized as susceptible only for colistin. On the other hand, fosfomycin was the only antibiotic that inhibited 90 % of E. coli and Klebsiella spp. isolates, while 90 % of P. aeruginosa isolates were inhibited only by colistin. Finally, 90 % of Acinetobacter spp. isolates were not inhibited by any antibiotic tested. Fosfomycin and colistin might be promising antibiotics for the treatment of infections due to E. coli or Klebsiella spp. and P. aeruginosa, respectively, in India; however, clinical trials should first corroborate the in vitro findings. The activity of tigecycline should be evaluated, as this is commonly used as last-resort option for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the prevalence and risk factors of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) -producing microorganisms in urinary tract infection. Materials and Methods: A total of 2, 312 patients older than 25 years and diagnosed from January 2007 to December 2009 as having urinary tract infection were studied. The prevalence of ESBL-producing microorganisms including Escherichia coli and the antimicrobial susceptibility of E. coli were examined. Univariate analyses were performed with gender, age, inpatient status, previous hospitalization, recent history of urinary catheterization, recent exposure to specific antibiotics, and past history of urogenital organ operation as risk factors for the emergence of ESBL-producing microorganisms. Then, multivariate analysis was performed with all significant variables. Results: In outpatient urinary tract infection, the antimicrobial susceptibility of E. coli to each of the third-generation cephalosporins, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone, was 87. 6 %, 93. 4 %, and 87. 7 %, respectively, and the prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli was 12. 1 %. In inpatient urinary tract infection, the susceptibility of E. coli was 78 %, 84. 5 %, and 76. 9 %, respectively, and the prevalence was 23. 1 %. Conclusions: The overall prevalence of ESBL-producing microorganism was 12. 6 % and the risk appeared to be increased in cases with a previous hospitalization, a recent history of urinary catheterization, inpatient status, cefaclor medication, <b>cefminox</b> administration, and female gender.

40|$|Background: Medical {{misuse of}} {{antibiotics}} {{is associated with}} the acquisition and spread of antibiotic resistance, resulting in a lack of effective drugs and increased health-care cost. Nevertheless, inappropriate antibiotic use in China remains common and the situation requires urgent improvement. Here, we analyzed the prescriptions of antibiotics and evaluated the rationality of antibiotic use among outpatients in Beijing general hospitals during 2015. Methods: We collected basic medical insurance claim data from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015 in 507 general hospitals of Beijing. A descriptive analysis of outpatient antibiotic prescribing was performed. The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification/defined daily doses system was used to evaluate the rationality of antibiotic use. Results: Over the study, an estimated 721, 930, 613, 520, and 822, 480 antibiotics were dispensed in primary, secondary, and tertiary general hospitals corresponding to 5. 09 %, 5. 06 %, and 2. 53 % of all prescriptions, respectively. Antibiotic combinations represented 2. 95 %, 7. 74 %, and 10. 18 % of the total antibiotic prescriptions, respectively. Expenditure for the top twenty antibiotics in primary, secondary, and tertiary general hospitals was RMB 42. 92, 65. 89, and 83. 26 million Yuan, respectively. Cephalosporins were the most frequently prescribed class of antibiotic in clinical practice. The antibiotics used inappropriately included azithromycin enteric-coated capsules, compound cefaclor tablets and nifuratel nysfungin vaginal soft capsules in primary hospitals, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium dispersible tablets (7 : 1) and cefonicid sodium for injection in secondary hospitals, <b>cefminox</b> sodium for injection and amoxicillin sodium and sulbactam sodium for injection in tertiary hospitals. Conclusions: Antibiotic use in Beijing general hospitals is generally low; however, inappropriate antibiotic use still exists. Inappropriately used antibiotics should be subject to rigorous control and management, and public policy initiatives are required to promote the judicious use of antibiotics...|$|E
