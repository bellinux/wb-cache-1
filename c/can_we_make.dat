First of all, we can make sure that the parents of these {{children}} keep them in school until their preferred level (college, university, etc.). They also need to teach/lead the mindsets of the children about how education is important and how child labor should not be their only main focus, but education should be too. More people should do this, while still focusing on their finances.|$|E
500|$|In {{providing}} instrumentation for the record, Kurstin {{used all}} of his instruments, such as a Mellotron and a Chamberlin, taping them from a distance to simulate the Wall of Sound, a recording technique originally developed by Phil Spector that was popular in the early 1960s. He enlisted Clarkson to provide all the background vocals herself. Clarkson, who grew up singing in a choir, {{was pleased with the}} aspect, saying: [...] "Blending is something I knew how to do from childhood. Sometimes I'd have to do an alto instead of a soprano because they needed a bigger sound. But I've never had to do anything like this before—doing all my backup vocals, essentially being my own choir." [...] Together, they began to record in May 2013 and continued through the summer of that year, beginning by recording [...] "White Christmas" [...] with Clarkson in the vocal booth and with Kurstin on a piano. She commented: [...] "The production is all him. I would be just like 'Hey, <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> this more jazz? Hey, <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> this more bluesy. And he just, like Harry Potter, made this happen. It's so weird." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{selecting}} which {{single to}} release first, Usher and the label considered various marketing strategies. With many potential lead singles that could fare well in music markets, they were choosing between [...] "Yeah!" [...] and [...] "Burn". Even though [...] "Burn" [...] {{was just what}} the label was looking for, they believed that [...] "Yeah!" [...] would be a blockbuster. Meanwhile, they felt [...] "Burn" [...] also failed to meet their expectations: [...] "'Burn' being a great song is one thing, but it's one of them things where people said, 'It's strong, but <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> history with that?' At {{the end of the}} day, you want an event." ...|$|E
500|$|Though [...] "Yeah!" [...] was now completed, {{the label}} still had [...] "Burn" [...] on queue {{for the lead}} single. Usher's friend and former A rep Kawan [...] "KP" [...] Prather commented: [...] "'Burn' being a great song is one thing, but it's one of them things where people said, 'It's strong, but <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> history with that?' At {{the end of the}} day, you want an event." [...] Usher was unsure if [...] "Yeah!" [...] was the right choice. After Lil Jon leaked [...] "Yeah!" [...] to street DJs across the United States, Usher opted [...] "Burn" [...] as the lead single of the album and was already {{planning}} for its music video. The song was not intended to be a proper single and only a teaser for Usher's fans after waiting for years. However, the responses of [...] "Yeah!" [...] were overwhelmingly favorable, and [...] "Yeah!" [...] was released as the first single instead of [...] "Burn", which became the second single from the album. The single was released in the United States on January 27, 2004 as a CD single and 12" [...] single. LaFace Records sent [...] "Yeah!" [...] to US contemporary hit radio on February 7, 2004. In the United Kingdom, it was released as a CD single, containing the album and instrumental version of the song, and two unreleased tracks from the album, [...] "Red Light" [...] and [...] "Sweet Lies".|$|E

500|$|Final Destination was {{conceived}} by writers Jeffrey Reddick, James Wong, and Glen Morgan from Flight 180, a spec script {{intended for use}} in The X-Files. The film premiered across the United States and Canada on March 17, 2000, grossing $10,015,822 on its opening weekend and an overall gross of $112,880,294 internationally. The film's success inspired New Line Cinema then-President of Production Toby Emmerich to approach Reddick for a sequel, to which he responded positively. Reddick asserted that he [...] "wanted to expand on the mythology and not just tell the same story over again.” Unfortunately, Wong and Morgan weren't available for production since they had already signed on their respective projects The One and Willard. Instead, New Line hired second unit director and stunt coordinator David R. Ellis as director and writing partners Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber as co-writers. [...] "Second unit is like an extension of directing, you’re doing big action sequences on film {{and it was just}} something I was going after. Once I got the offer from New Line and we got a good script, {{it was kind of a}} natural transition," [...] Ellis professed. [...] "I wanted our film to be able to stand alone but I watched Final Destination to see what they did that was so successful. I tried to use some of that while trying to keep a stand-alone feel for our movie. I kind of took what worked and tried to improve on it," [...] Ellis added. [...] "We wanted to take what the first film did effectively, and add levels and layers that would come out through the characters. When we first started writing this, we were trying to think, 'How <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> Death just a total badass?' and to be perfectly honest, the first crack we ever took at this script had to be reined in!" [...] Bress uncovered. On the other hand, producers Craig Perry and Warren Zide from Zide/Perry Productions also returned and helped on financing the film.|$|E

For example, when Austrian-born neurobiologist Eric Kandel won the Nobel Prize in 2000, he [...] "stuck it to the Austrians" [...] by saying it was certainly not an Austrian Nobel, it was a Jewish-American Nobel. After that, he got a call from then Austrian president Thomas Klestil asking him, [...] "How <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> things right?"

Tim Sweeney, said that the new business model is a reflection of changes in the industry. Epic Games has traditionally made its Unreal Engine available to large AAA game development teams at a cost of millions of dollars but as the industry has evolved, Epic has had to [...] "really rethink our whole business as to how we make the engine available to teams." [...] "Looking at the new shape of the industry now, we realize that's an outdated tool," [...] Sweeney said.

2500|$|While a {{complete}} theory along this line {{has not been}} developed, entertaining and developing this hypothesis led scholars to interesting speculation and fruitful intuitions on how <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> sense of our world within a discrete framework. Marvin Minsky, the AI pioneer, investigated how to understand particle interaction with a four-dimensional CA lattice; Konrad Zuse—the inventor of the first working computer, the Z3—developed an irregularly organized lattice {{to address the question}} of the information content of particles. More recently, Edward Fredkin exposed what he terms the [...] "finite nature hypothesis", i.e., the idea that [...] "ultimately every quantity of physics, including space and time, {{will turn out to be}} discrete and finite." [...] Fredkin and Wolfram are strong proponents of a CA-based physics. In 2016 Gerard 't Hooft published a book long development of the idea to rebuild quantum mechanics using cellular automata.|$|E
