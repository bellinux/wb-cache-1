50|$|Mallite {{is a type}} of {{laminate}} composite material, formerly {{manufactured by}} the William Mallinson & Sons company. The material is formed of a <b>core</b> <b>sheet</b> of end grain balsa wood, faced by duralumin sheets. This construction endows the finished material with greater strength and rigidity than a light alloy sheet of equal mass. The material was originally developed in the late 1950s for use in the aerospace industry, primarily for use in flooring and internal partitioning in jet airliner construction. However, it found fame {{as one of the first}} engineered composite materials to be employed in the motorsport industry. Robin Herd, formerly a designer on the Concorde project, used his aerospace knowledge to design the first McLaren single-seater racing cars. The M2A prototype used Mallite extensively, throughout its construction. The final production model, the Formula One McLaren M2B of 1966, only used Mallite for its internal skins and lower bodywork; a lack of understanding of the material's properties had led the team to design the car with conventional curved bodywork, creating problems during the fabrication process as the inherently inflexible material would not readily conform to complex, compound curvatures. With greater understanding of Mallite's properties Herd later used the material to construct the unraced Cosworth four-wheel drive Formula One car of 1969, noted for its slab-sided, angular looks.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The dynamic {{response}} of the square honeycomb sandwich plates subjected to blast loading was simulated and analyzed by using the finite element software ABAQUS. With the given mass per unit area, <b>core</b> <b>sheet</b> spacing and height, the optimal relative density of the core was obtained under blast loading of three levels. With this optimal relative density, the sandwich plates have the best shock resistance ability and {{the top and bottom}} face sheets have the smallest deflection subjected to impulsive load. The sandwich plates were compared with the solid plates having the same mass per unit area. The results show that the sandwich plates have higher strength and energy absorption capability. Furthermore, influence of geometrical parameters including <b>core</b> <b>sheet</b> spacing, thickness, height and face sheet thickness on the face sheets’s maximum deflection were discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Many {{water pipes}} used in {{distribution}} networks (cooling system, fire network, drainage [...] .) are constituted of a core welded sheet coated with reinforced concrete. Steel constitutive of these pipes, in particular when {{in contact with}} sea water, are subject to corrosion. This corrosion involves reduction of the metallic <b>core</b> <b>sheet</b> thickness, which could affect the watertightness and the mechanical resistance of the pipe.

Powder metallurgy (P/M) Ti- 22 Al- 25 Nb alloy was prepared by hot pressed sintering at 1050 ˚C for 1 h under a pressure of 35 MPa. The flow behavior of a P/M Ti- 22 Al- 25 Nb alloy was evaluated by applying a series of compression tests with height reduction of 50 % performed in a temperature range of 940 - 1070 ˚C and a strain rate range of 0. 001 - 1 s- 1.

40|$|Abstract Almost {{one third}} of the overall {{transmission}} and distribution systems energy losses are lost in distribution transformers, while its core losses account for almost 70 % of the total transformers losses. A reasonably fast calculation tool to facilitate the core loss optimization through accurate predetermination of the impact of different design parameters on its losses seems indispensable, for a transformer manufacturer. In this paper, a novel fast 2 -D FEA transformer core loss determination method is presented. Assuming the normal component of the magnetic field to be zero, this method reduces the computation time substantially in comparison with the available conventional methods (maintaining the same accuracy level). Employing Gaussian fitting curve, the anisotropic and the non-linear behavior of the magnetic core material are modeled. The extra core losses which occur in the <b>core</b> <b>sheets</b> joints and the stacking holes are simulated accurately in this work. The proposed method is implemented on 12 different commercial size distribution transformers, to verify the speed and the accuracy of this computation method...|$|R

Increasing the corrugation angle and the <b>core</b> <b>sheet</b> thickness improved the specific bending strength of the sandwich structure, while increasing in the bond length led to reduction in the specific bending strength.

40|$|Metal/polymer/metal {{sandwich}} laminates show {{a rising}} rate {{in a variety}} of applications, for instance in automotive and aircraft industry. Due to the dissimilarity between the metal skin sheets and the polymer core, characterizing the forming potential of such laminates is a necessity. In this study, steel skin sheets and polypropylene-polyethylene copolymer as <b>core</b> <b>sheet</b> – called sandwich laminates - were used. They were produced in a roll bonding process using an adhesive agent. One major research point in IMET is investigating the effect of core and skin thicknesses on the forming behavior and mechanical properties of the sandwich laminates. Forming behavior is evaluated using deep drawing in addition to determining the forming limit curves (FLC). Bonding strength is evaluated by lap shear tests. More-over, the durability of the steel/polymer joints are evaluated under hydrothermal ageing conditions following heating/cooling regime cycles. Basically, the mechanical properties were determined using tensile testing. The adhesion test results show good adhesion strength and a cohesive failure mode. The lap shear strength after ageing shows no remarkable deterioration. The deep drawability of the sandwich laminates depends on the thicknesses of the layers and their volume fraction. With increasing the core thickness, the limiting drawing ratio (LDR) decreases and the probability of wrinkling in the flange area and cracking is higher as well. In case of different skin thicknesses in one sandwich, the best setting condition is to position the thinner skin in contact with the forming tool (punch) if acceptable by design...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{discusses the}} main processes of a superplastic forming (SPF) method {{to form a}} complex component with eight-pocket from a four-sheet sandwich panel sheetstock. Four sheets of titanium alloys were welded using resistance seam welding based on a defined pattern to manufacture a composite sheetstock of four layers. The composite sheet structures were inflated via SPF process using the Advanced Forming Research Centre’s 200 T SPF press in pockets where the sheets were not welded to each other to form a complex component. Each sheetstock was arranged to consist of four sheets: two <b>core</b> <b>sheets</b> from the same material, which create the inner structure of the panel, two skin sheets from the same material, which form the outer structure of the panel. Ti 64 (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) and Ti 54 M (Ti- 5 Al- 4 Cr- 4 Mo- 2 Sn- 2 Zr titanium alloy sheets {{were used for the}} <b>core</b> <b>sheets,</b> whereas Ti 64 and Ti 6242 (Ti- 6 Al- 2 Sn- 4 Zr- 2 Mo) titanium alloy sheets were used for the outer sheets of the packs. I will also discuss the manufacture and assembly of the four-sheet packs, and briefly, explain the manufacturing processes adopted to manufacture the dies used in SPF trials. Furthermore, I will go through the applied methodology to define the SPF pressure-time curves to inflate the packs for two SPF gas feeding pipes at specific forming temperature and strain rate. Several samples from selected regions of each inflated pack were investigated via optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to study whether diffusion bonding occurred between the sheets. The optical microscopy images were obtained for three different levels of magnification (x 10, x 20, and x 50) for all samples. The GOM scanning and image analysis demonstrated that during SPF the multisheet packs underwent a degree of diffusion bonding where the adjacent sheets exhibited thickness reduction under compression forces. The thickness reduction to the component surfaces imposed by SPF was found to be up to 59 % in some regions of the packs and the elongation was estimated to be up to 134 %. The same procedure could be implemented to manufacture sandwich panels with more complex core configurations from sheetstock composed of more than three sheets and made of different titanium alloy...|$|R

40|$|Carbamoyl {{phosphate}} (CP), {{an essential}} precursor of arginine and the pyrirnidine bases, is synthesized by CP synthetase (CPS) in three steps. The last step, the phosphorylation of carbamate, is also catalyzed by carbamate kinase (CK), an enzyme used by microorganisms to produce ATP from ADP and CP. Although the recently determined structures of CPS and CK show no obvious mutual similarities, a CK-like CPS reported in hyperthermophilic archaea was postulated to be a missing {{link in the}} evolution of CP biosynthesis. The 1. 5 Å resolution structure of this enzyme from Pyrococcus furiosus shows both a subunit topology and a homodimeric molecular organization, with a 16 -stranded open β-sheet core surrounded by α-helices, similar to those in CK. However, the pyrococcal enzyme exhibits many solvent-accessible ion-pairs, an extensive, strongly hydrophobic, intersubunit surface, and presents a bound ADP molecule, which does not dissociate at 22 °C from the enzyme. The ADP nucleotide is sequestered in a ridge formed over. the C-edge of the <b>core</b> <b>sheet,</b> {{at the bottom of a}} large cavity, with the purine ring enclosed in a pocket specific for adenine. Overall, the enzyme structure is ill-suited for catalyzing the characteristic three-step reaction of CPS and supports the view that the CK-like CPS is in fact a highly thermostable and very slow (at 37 °C) CK that, in the extreme environment of P. furiosus, may have the new function of making, rather than using, CP. The thermostability of the enzyme may result from the extension of the hydrophobic intersubunit contacts and from the large number of exposed ion-pairs, some of which form ion-pair networks across several secondary structure elements in each enzyme subunit. The structure provides the first information on substrate binding and catalysis in CKs, and suggests that the slow rate at 37 °C is possibly a consequence of slow product dissociation.

Assuming a harmonic time-dependent response, the problem is transformed into an eigenvalue problem, which can be solved in a numerically rather efficient manner. The numerical scheme is applied to an analysis of the effect of the face sheet anisotropy induced by fibre angle variations in laminated face sheets consisting of unidirectionally infinite fibre reinforced carbon epoxy plies.
