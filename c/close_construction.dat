6000|$|This {{peculiar}} trait {{was connected}} with another that sometimes amused friends, but always exasperated foes. Among the papers {{is a letter}} from an illustrious man to Mr. Gladstone--wickedly no better dated by the writer than 'Saturday,' and no better docketed by the receiver than 'T. B. Macaulay, March 1,'--showing that Mr. Gladstone was just as energetic, say in some year between 1835 and 1850, in defending the entire consistency between a certain speech of the dubious date and a speech in 1833, as he ever afterwards showed himself in the same too familiar process. In later times he {{described himself as a}} sort of purist in what touches the consistency of statesmen. 'Change of opinion,' he said, 'in those to whose judgment the public looks more or less to assist its own, is an evil to the country, although a much smaller evil than their persistence in a course which they know to be wrong. It is not always to be blamed. But it is always to be watched with vigilance; always to be challenged and put upon its trial.'[133] To this challenge in his own case--and no man of his day was half so often put upon his trial for inconsistency--he was always most easily provoked to make a vehement reply. In that process Mr. Gladstone's natural habit of resort to qualifying words, and his skill in showing that a new attitude could be reconciled by strict reasoning with the logical contents of old dicta, gave him wonderful advantage. His adversary, as he strode confidently along the smooth grass, suddenly found himself treading on a serpent; he had overlooked a condition, a proviso, a word of hypothesis or contingency, that sprang from its ambush and brought his triumph to naught on the spot. If Mr. Gladstone had only taken as much trouble that his hearers should understand exactly what it was that he meant, as he took trouble afterwards to show that his meaning had been grossly misunderstood, all might have been well. As it was, he seemed to be completely satisfied if he could only show that two propositions, thought by plain men to be directly contradictory, were all the time capable on <b>close</b> <b>construction</b> of being presented in perfect harmony. As if I had a right to look only to what my words literally mean or may in good logic be made to mean, and had no concern at all with what the people meant who used the same words, or with what I might have known that my hearers were all the time supposing me to mean. Hope-Scott once wrote to him (November 24, 1841): 'We live in a time in which accurate distinctions, especially in theology, are absolutely unconsidered. The [...] "common sense" [...] or general tenor of questions is what alone the majority of men are guided by. And I verily believe that semi-arian confessions or any others turning upon nicety of thought and expression, would be for the most part considered as fitter subjects for scholastic dreamers than for earnest Christians.' In politics at any rate, Bishop Butler was wiser.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of two parts. The first one is connected {{with the establishment of}} Preposition as a word class, and with that class of Prepositions whose association with the governing word is accounted for in a transformational generative grammar (TGG) either by a lexical redundancy rule or by a transformation, e. g. the prepositions associating with the active and the passive participles deriving from transitive verbs. The second part on the other hand is interested in Verb-Preposition-Noun combinations: it tries to differentiate between those whose verbal elements are in <b>close</b> <b>construction</b> with the Preposition-Noun Components, i. e. are prepositional verbs (PV), and those whose verbal elements are not, i. e. are non-PVs: true intransitive or intransitively used transitive verbs. To make an accurate comparison between these two classes of Verb-Preposition-Noun combinations the discussion is confined to the clauses embracing them and nothing but the subjects of their verbal elements. However, the structural peculiarities of the Preposition-Noun components of the Verb-Preposition-Noun combinations embraced by other clauses are discussed {{as long as they are}} identical with those of the Verb-Preposition-Noun combinations in the former clauses. The thesis is that setting up an Arabic PV has nothing to do with the constituency break of the Verb-Preposition-Noun combinations: both classes of these combinations break into Verb/Preposition-Noun components; and in this respect Arabic Verb-Preposition-Noun combinations are different from their English counterparts. A number of criteria including the co-occurrence restrictions related to the two classes of Verb-Preposition-Noun combinations are used to justify this thesis. With reference to the last criterion an attempt is made to incorporate into a TGG the co-occurrence restrictions associated with Verb-Preposition-Noun combinations. Part of this attempt is connected with the Verb-Preposition-Noun combinations whose verbal elements are non-PVs, and the other with the Verb-Preposition-Noun combinations whose verbal elements are PVs. In relation to both the first and the second part of this attempt an introductory evaluative examination is made of some previous transformational works on Verb-Preposition-Noun combinations and the restrictions related to them. The thesis ends with a chapter about the characteristics of the prepositional object of PV, i. e. of the Preposition-Noun component with which PV associates. Such characteristics are proved to be the appropriate bases for recognizing PV and differefttiating it from its counterpart, i. e. the verbal element of the Veib-Preposition-Noun combination whose P-N component functions as Adjunct...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT In the State of Iowa, bridge widths are {{typically}} limited to 60 -ft. Although {{the justification for}} 60 -ft is somewhat unknown, there is a desire, in some cases, to build wider bridges. For example, when dual bridges are constructed in urban areas they are frequently constructed very close to one another. In essence, this <b>close</b> <b>construction</b> results in a 2 ̆ 2 joint 2 ̆ 2 between bridges which is known to trap water and other debris which in some cases has led to accelerated deterioration. At the same time, integral abutment bridges are in wide use (in Iowa and beyond), since they have no expansion joints to allow leaking of chloride-contaminated water that can corrode {{the bottom of the}} deck and the adjacent girders. Thus, the practice of limiting bridge width and introducing a 2 ̆ 2 joint 2 ̆ 2 between dual bridges goes against other current practices. However, because there is concern that increased bridge width results in an increased propensity for cracking, there is resistance to commonly constructing wider bridges. The primary objective of this project is to determine the effect of bridge width on deck cracking in bridges. Other parameters, such as bridge skew, girder spacing and type, abutment type, pier type and number of bridge spans were also studied. To achieve the above objectives, one bridge was selected to conduct live-load and long-term testing. The data obtained from both field tests were used to calibrate a three-dimensional (3 D) Finite Element Model (FEM). Three different types of loading-live loading, thermal loading and shrinkage loading-were applied and used to calibrate the analytical model. A parametric study was then conducted using the calibrated FEM. The general conclusions are as follows: * Longitudinal and diagonal cracking in the deck near the abutment on an integral abutment bridge is due to the temperature differences between the abutment and the deck. * Based upon a limited review of bridges in the Iowa DOT inventory, it appears that, regardless of bridge width, longitudinal and diagonal cracks are prevalent in integral abutment bridges but not in bridges with stub abutments. * The parametric study results show that bridge width and skew have minimal effect on the strain in the deck bridge resulting from restrained thermal expansion. In other words, integral abutment bridges will show similar cracking regardless of width. * Pier type, girder type, girder spacing and number of spans also appear to have no influence on the level of restrained thermal expansion strain in the deck near the abutment. * FEM results showed that an effective solution to reduce cracking in the deck might be to place an isolation pad between the soil and back side of abutment...|$|E
40|$|This study {{determines the}} three basic data, which are light-shielding rate, surface {{roughness}} (by Manning's coefficient) and apparent opening size, of the nonwoven three-D netting, woven serfertnet method {{as well as}} three-D iron diamond compound netting of plastic materials by related experimental equipment; uses artificial rainfall instrument and hydraulic launders to conduct soil erosion and trap tests to get the different effects of different materials on soil erosion prevention and vegetation; and, tests and verifies the reliability and necessity of indoor tests by contrasting on-the-spot investigation data. The test of artificial rainfall takes the agricultural soil that is with the thickness of 10 cm and from Lugu Township of Nantou County at the altitude of 800 m as the bottom soil. Artificial materials are laid on the surface, and then, the organic soil without any adhesive with the thickness of 3 cm is sprayed on it. The testing conditions are the gradients of 15 ˚ and 45 ˚ and the rainfall intensity of 130 mm/hr. Soil erosion tests are separately conducted for 20 min on the three artificial covering materials and the laid control group. And, the trap efficiency of different materials are determined by adding homogenized sand grains with the fixed quantity into the steady launder with the gradient of 4. 5 ˚. According to the test, the nonwoven three-D netting with the light-shielding rate of 63 %, the Manning's coefficient of 0. 080 and the irregular structural type has the highest anti-erosion efficiency in the soil erosion test. The serfertnet method with the light-shielding rate of 66 %, the Manning's coefficient of 0. 163 and the regular structural type has the best efficiency in the trap test. However, both the two efficiency of the three-D iron diamond compound netting with light-shielding rate of 27 %, the Manning's coefficient of 0. 037 and regular structural type are low. As to the differences between vegetation restoration effects, this study develops the mode illustration of vegetation restoration hydrograph with the three modes of normality, slowness and fault by adopting the graph of plant growth (Lin, Hsin-Hui, 2000) and the mode illustration of ecological evolution (ODUM, 1996), and analyzes the modes by the 27 investigation points between 248. 7 K~ 386 K of the toward-north National Highway No. 3 with <b>close</b> <b>construction</b> periods. In light {{of the results of}} this study, we could tell that different ant-erosion covering materials of being vegatated by net have different characters. And, in accordance with the quantified data of this study, the function differences shown by characteristic data could be specifically defined, which could be taken as not only the basis of the quality control for applying similar materials to engineering application practically, but also the basis of choosing the materials of the engineering of being vegatated by net on sloping fields as well as the basis of designing the corresponding working methods. 透過相關實驗設備測定化纖材質非編織型立體網材，編織型肥束網和立體鐵菱型複合網的光遮蔽率、表面粗糙度(採計曼寧n值) 和表觀孔徑等三項基本數據，並運用人工降雨試驗台和水工流槽進行土壤沖蝕及囚砂試驗，求得不同的資材對土壤沖蝕防治和植生成效之差異，最後透過現地調查資料的比對，以驗證室內試驗的可靠性與必要性。 人工降雨試驗以厚度 10 cm，採自南投縣鹿谷鄉海拔 800 m處之農地土壤為底層土壤，表面鋪設人造資材後再灑覆厚度 3 cm未添加黏著劑之有機土，試驗條件為坡度為 15 ˚和 45 ˚降雨強度 130 mm/hr, 分別對三種人造被覆資材及鋪設之對照組進行 20 min的土壤沖蝕試驗。以及在坡度 4. 5 ˚的穩定流水槽中定量加入均質砂粒，測定不同資材的囚砂率。試驗結果發現光遮蔽率 63 %、曼寧n值 0. 080 ，結構形態為不規則的非編織型立體網材在土壤沖蝕試驗中，其抗沖蝕效率最高。光遮蔽率 66 %、曼寧n值 0. 163 ，結構形態為規則的肥束網帶在囚砂試驗中效率最高。覆蓋率 27 %、曼寧n值 0. 037 ，結構形態為規則的立體鐵菱型複合網兩者表現均低。 對於植生復育成效之差異，本研究引用植物生長曲線圖(林信輝， 2000) 和生態演替模式圖(ODUM, 1996) ，發展出包含常態、遲緩和斷層三模式的植生復育歷線模式圖，以施工期相近的國道三號北上 248. 7 K~ 386 K總計個 27 調查點，進行分析判別其模式。 由研究結果可知不同的掛網植生用抗沖蝕被覆材有其不同之特點，就本研究所得之量化數據，可明確的定義每一個特性數據所呈現的功能差異，在實務上除可做為相類似資材在工程應用上的品質管制依據外，最重要的是可做為坡地掛網植生工程選材和配合工法的設計評估依據。謝誌	I 摘要	II ABSTRACT	III 目 錄	V 表目錄	VIII 圖 目 錄	IX 第一章	前言	 1 1. 1 	緣起動機	 1 1. 2 	方法與目的	 2 第二章	文獻回顧	 4 2. 1 	土壤沖蝕相關研究	 4 2. 2 	漫地流沖蝕相關研究	 5 2. 3 	曼寧粗糙係數與沖蝕相關研究	 5 2. 4 	不同的地表狀況對土壤沖蝕之研究	 7 2. 5 	地工織物與抗沖蝕資材相關研究	 9 2. 6 	試驗設備之相關研究	 10 2. 7 	人工降雨試驗台	 11 2. 8 	植生與自然演替	 12 2. 8. 1 	自然演替	 12 第三章	研究材料與方法	 14 3. 1 	實驗流程	 15 3. 2 	土壤試驗	 16 3. 3 	被覆材基本特性試驗	 16 3. 3. 1 	試驗項目	 17 3. 4 	室內人工降雨沖蝕試驗	 20 3. 4. 1 	試驗設備	 20 3. 4. 2 	操作方法	 20 3. 5 	囚砂率試驗	 22 3. 6 	現地調查	 23 第四章	結果分析與討論	 24 4. 1 	土壤分析結果	 24 4. 2 	抗沖蝕材基本特性試驗結果	 24 4. 3 	室內人工降雨沖蝕試驗結果	 25 4. 3. 1 	雨量率定試驗結果	 25 4. 3. 2 	沖蝕試驗結果	 25 4. 4 	比對分析與討論	 43 4. 4. 1 	土壤沖蝕防治成效關係	 43 4. 4. 2 	植生復育成效關係	 45 4. 5 	綜合討論	 47 4. 5. 1 	土壤沖蝕行為與植生復育關係	 47 4. 5. 2 	室內實驗與現地調查結果探討	 51 第五章	結論與建議	 56 參考文獻	 5...|$|E
