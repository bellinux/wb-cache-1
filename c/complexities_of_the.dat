5|$|As {{a thought}} {{experiment}} in economics, many international trade economists {{have found this}} simplified and idealized {{version of the story}} important due to its ability to simplify the <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real world. The implicit assumption is that the study of a one agent economy will provide useful insights into the functioning of a real world economy with many economic agents. This article pertains to the study of consumer behaviour, producer behaviour and equilibrium as a part of microeconomics. In other fields of economics, the Robinson Crusoe economy framework is used for essentially the same thing. For example, in public finance the Robinson Crusoe economy is used to study the various types of public goods and certain aspects of collective benefits. It is used in growth economics to develop growth models for underdeveloped or developing countries to embark upon a steady growth path using techniques of savings and investment.|$|E

Final Fantasy X was the first game that allowed for 3-D model rendering of backgrounds that increased the presentation, including small details like grass {{blowing in the wind}} and cloud movement. Takayoshi Nakazato decided to abandon the typical world map concept for a more realistic depiction. Final Fantasy Xs spatial presentation of Spira is tied to progression; with a player's progress being marked through the panoramic introduction and depiction of the area upon first entry.

In a production process where tasks are complementary, the employer {{may have an}} incentive to pay higher wages when using more complex technologies because <b>the</b> output <b>of</b> such processes is more effort-sensitive. We use linked employer-employee data from the Finnish metal industry. These data provide quantified information on <b>the</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tasks <b>of</b> individual workers. <b>The</b> average <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tasks in the firm is used as a proxy for <b>the</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> production process.

25|$|The above CSM model {{requires}} that a total order of all {{objects in the}} system be specified. Effectively, the specification is reduced to new objects introduced by insert operations. However, specification of the total order entails application-specific policies such as those to break insertion ties (i.e., new objects inserted by two current operations at the same position). Consequently, the total order becomes application specific. Moreover, in the algorithm, the total order must be maintained in the transformation functions and control procedure, which increases time/space <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> algorithm.|$|E
40|$|This paper studies empirically <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Þrms {{production}} process on <b>the</b> hourly wages <b>of</b> workers at different tasks. According to models where tasks are complemen-tary in the {{production process}} and differentially sensitive to workers effort, <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Þrms production process will affect wage differentials both within and across tasks. Theoretical arguments are due to Kremer and Maskin [11] and Dalmazzo and Scaramozzino [6]. We argue that the Finnish metal industry data are suitable for <b>the</b> empirical analysis <b>of</b> this implication because they provide quantiÞed information on <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tasks <b>of</b> individual workers.
