2500|$|Configuration {{identification}} {{is the process}} of identifying the attributes that define every aspect of a configuration item. [...] A configuration item is a product (hardware and/or software) that has an end-user purpose. [...] These attributes are recorded in configuration documentation and baselined.

2500|$|Configuration Management {{originated}} in the United States Department of Defense in the 1950s as a technical management discipline for hardware material items—and {{it is now a}} standard practice in virtually every industry. The CM process became its own technical discipline sometime in the late 1960s when the DoD developed a series of military standards called the [...] "480 series" [...] (i.e., MIL-STD-480, MIL-STD-481 and MIL-STD-483) that were subsequently issued in the 1970s. In 1991, the [...] "480 series" [...] was consolidated into a single standard known as the MIL–STD–973 that was then replaced by MIL–HDBK–61 pursuant to a general DoD goal that reduced the number of military standards in favor of industry technical standards supported by standards developing organizations (SDO). This marked the beginning of what has now evolved into the most widely distributed and accepted standard on CM, ANSI–EIA–649–1998. Now widely adopted by numerous organizations and agencies, the CM discipline's concepts include systems engineering (SE), integrated logistics support (ILS), Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), ISO 9000, Prince2 project management method, COBIT, Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), product lifecycle management, and application lifecycle management. [...] Many of these functions and models have redefined CM from its traditional holistic approach to technical management. Some treat CM as being similar to a librarian activity, and break out <b>change</b> <b>control</b> or change management as a separate or stand alone discipline.|$|E

50|$|In {{software}} development, a <b>Change</b> <b>Control</b> Board (CCB) or Software <b>Change</b> <b>Control</b> Board (SCCB) is {{a committee}} that makes decisions regarding {{whether or not}} proposed changes to a software project should be implemented. In short any changes to the Baseline Requirements agreed with the client, should be taken up by project team on approval from this committee. If any change is agreed by the committee, it is communicated to the project team and client and the requirement is Baselined with the change. The <b>change</b> <b>control</b> board is constituted of project stakeholders or their representatives. The authority of the <b>change</b> <b>control</b> board may vary from project to project, but decisions reached by the <b>change</b> <b>control</b> board are often accepted as final and binding. The decision of acceptance of the changes also depends upon the stage or phase of the project. The main objective of CCB or SCCB is to ensure acceptance of the project (deliverable) by the client.|$|E
