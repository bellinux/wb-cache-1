40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis precipitated a condensing {{of capital and}} a fall in global equities markets that not only resulted in the necessity of government bailouts of the financial industry, but also exposed a number of Ponzi schemes that collectively will cost investors {{tens of billions of}} dollars. With a new wave of litigation by innocent investors against Ponzi scheme operators just beginning, and likely to take years to finish, it becomes important to clearly identify the methodologies used to value the loss and allocate existing assets among the remaining creditors. To that end, this Article argues that courts ought to use a comparatively new approach— the loss to the losing victim methodology originally pioneered in criminal law—to determine how equally innocent victims share the losses these schemes precipitated.

40|$|In credit {{portfolio}} modelling the normal copula approach and multi-factor models have be-come an industry-wide standard {{to describe the}} asset correlation structure. To calculate the portfolio loss distribution for these models, due to its analytical intractability, in general Monte Carlo methods, non-trivial numerical integrations, or structural simplifications have to be applied. Still, for more than 3 - 4 factors especially determination of risk contributions and optimisation routines become a very time-consuming endeavour. Aim {{of this paper is}} to present a new factor reduction approach using a single underlying factor to calculate the portfolio loss distribution. Focusing on risk contributions rather than asset correlations it is shown that the portfolio correlation structure could be captured in just one factor to an astonishing degree of accuracy. The paper outlines the basic idea and calibration of this factor reduction approach, and for illustrative as well as realistic, heterogeneous portfolios the new model is applied in the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> distributions and risk contributions.

40|$|The <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> {{is vital}} for design flood {{estimation}} models {{and in order to}} estimate continuing loss (CL), proportional loss (PL) and volumetric runoff coefficient, the surface runoff has to be separated from the total given in a stream flow hydrograph. To obtain the volume of surface runoff from the streamflow hydrograph, baseflow separation becomes necessary and in this paper a few base flow separation methods are explored and an appropriate method selected to assess to impact of baseflow on loss estimates. The process of separation requires a base flow separation coefficient and this coefficient (&# 945;) is selected from individual study catchments from 3 to 5 rainfall streamflow events of the same catchments based on sensitivity analysis. The selected &# 945; value of individual catchments is then applied to other rainfall streamflow events of a given catchment. It has been observed that a small degree of error in the selection of &# 945; value does not seem to affect the estimates of the CL, PL or runoff coefficient.

The static approach that involves the solution of Laplace’s equation can be utilized to characterize many important properties of microstrip lines, microshield lines, and microwave photonic components. In this work, we have incorporated such an analysis to obtain propagation loss in MMIC transmission lines and high-speed electrooptic modulators on LiNbO 3 and GaAs. It is shown that microwave losses play an important role on optical bandwidth of these modulators and the estimation of bandwidth depends on accurate <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss.</b> Here, the Perlow’s generalized equation has been used to estimate the propagation loss of MMIC lines and very good agreement with the previously published results has been obtained. Very important microwave properties for the design and optimization of MMIC lines and modulators, such as, microwave effective index, characteristic impedance are also calculated by using the capacitance per unit length. These properties have been used in the estimation loss. The dependence of microwave properties with the structural parameters are also investigated and it has been found that considering a dielectric material lossless always lead to an over estimation of optical bandwidth of modulators.

The number of studies analyzed was 469, and {{the total number of}} subjects was 54, 274. A linear model provided a fit of the data, for each variable, that was not significantly different from the best polynomial fit.

40|$|When {{assessing}} future {{pecuniary loss}} in personal injury litigation, courts often use the multiplicand/multiplier approach. The {{objective is to}} calculate a lump sum amount to compensate the plaintiff for a stream of future lost earnings and/or a stream of future expenses. Conventionally, the Hong Kong Courts followed the English authorities in choosing multipliers. Most judges select the multipliers by reference to a spread of multipliers in comparable English and Hong Kong cases. This conventional approach was first challenged in the Hong Kong Court of First Instance in 1995 (Chan Pui Ki (An Infant) v Leung On [1995] 3 HKC 732). The trial judge abandoned the conventional method of choosing multipliers and admitted actuarial evidence to calculate the appropriate multiplier. However, this decision was subsequently reversed by the Hong Kong Court of Appeal in 1996 which held that the conventional multipliers for the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> of future earnings should be maintained. The Court of Appeal also discouraged any further use of expert evidence given by economists and actuaries in Hong Kong personal injury litigation. On the contrary, the House of Lords in England made a landmark decision (Wells v Wells [1999] AC 345). It approved actuarial evidence as the primary method of assessing future pecuniary loss. In this respect, the socio-legal implications of the English House of Lords decision in Hong Kong will be analysed. In addition, the legal and actuarial principles in calculating multipliers will also be explored and examined...|$|E

Abstract <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> is possible only when the contract goods have current price. Current price is the price generally charged for such goods sold under comparable circumstances in the trade concerned. According to the CISG and Serbian Law of Obligations, for the determination of the current price is relevant time of avoidance. This general rule is not applicable in international sales law when the party claiming damages has avoided the contract after taking over the goods. In that case, the current price at the time of taking over shall be applicable instead of the current price at the time of avoidance. Current price rule contained in the Art. 76 (2) of the CISG presupposes that the current price is the price prevailing at the place where the delivery of the goods should have been made, or if there is no current price at the place, the price at such other place as serves as a reasonable substitute, making due allowance for differences in the cost of transporting the goods. Pursuant to Art. 524 (2) Of Serbian Law of Obligations, however, relevant is the price in the market of the place of effecting the transaction.
