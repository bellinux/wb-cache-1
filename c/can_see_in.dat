5|$|Cats {{are similar}} in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong {{flexible}} body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and {{a better sense of}} smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting), as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.|$|E
5|$|The {{porpoise}} eye {{is relatively}} small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, {{the eyes of a}} porpoise are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When porpoises surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; their eyes contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> both dim and bright light. Porpoises do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most porpoises have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, they are able to form a very clear image of the surrounding area.|$|E

The human eye, through adaptation of the iris and other methods, adjusts constantly {{to adapt to a}} broad range of luminance present in the environment. The brain continuously interprets this information so that a viewer <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> a wide range of light conditions.|$|E

25|$|Explaining {{the origins}} of the law that one <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the Cities of Refuge, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote that early forms of legal {{procedure}} were grounded in vengeance. Roman law and German law started from the blood feud, which led to the composition, at first optional, then compulsory, by which the feud was bought off. Holmes reported that in Anglo-Saxon practice, the feud was pretty well broken up by the time of William the Conqueror. The killings and house-burnings of an earlier day became the appeals of mayhem and arson, and then the legal actions now familiar to lawyers.|$|E
25|$|Belugas {{are able}} to see within and outside of water, but their vision is {{relatively}} poor when compared to dolphins. Their eyes are especially adapted to seeing under water, although when they {{come into contact with}} the air, the crystalline lens and the cornea adjust to overcome the associated myopia (the range of vision under water is short). A beluga's retina has cones and rods, which also suggests they <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> low light. The presence of cone cells indicates they can see colours, although this suggestion has not been confirmed. Glands located in the medial corner of their eyes secrete an oily, gelatinous substance that lubricates the eye and helps flush out foreign bodies. This substance forms a film that protects the cornea and the conjunctiva from pathogenic organisms.|$|E
25|$|The {{decarboxylation}} of oxalosuccinate (below center) {{is a key}} step in {{the formation}} of alpha-ketoglutarate. In this reaction, the lone pair on the adjacent Tyrosine hydroxyl abstracts the proton off the carboxyl group. This carboxyl group is also referred to as the beta subunit in the isocitrate molecule. The deprotonation of the carboxyl group causes the lone pair of electrons to move down making carbon dioxide and separating from oxalosuccinate. The electrons continue to move towards the alpha carbon pushing the double bond electrons (making the ketone) up to abstract a proton off an adjacent lysine residue. An alpha-beta unsaturated double bond results between carbon 2 and three. As you <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the picture, the green ion represents either Mg2+ or Mn2+, which is a cofactor necessary for this reaction to occur. The metal-ion forms a little complex through ionic interactions with the oxygen atoms on the fourth and fifth carbons (also known as the gamma subunit of isocitrate).|$|E

25|$|The Bay Observatory {{building}} {{is the only}} new building constructed on the Exploratorium‚Äôs campus.

The Observatory has glass walls on all four sides to facilitate observation. Many of the exhibits were developed specifically for the location, such as Oculus (a circular opening in the ceiling that allows the entire gallery {{to be used as}} a timepiece, tracking seasons, solstices, and the sun‚Äôs movement), Visualizing the Bay (a 3-D topographic map of the Bay Area that allows visitors to see real data mapped over the landscape, such as the movement of fog and the salinity of the Bay over the course of days or years), and the Map Table (an assortment of historic and contemporary maps and atlases displaying different views and perspectives on the landscape).|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of the Renormalization Group Theory of the instanton vacuum one can form a general flow diagram where the topological sectors are {{represented}} by attractive fixed points. When scaling the effective system to larger sizes, the system generally flows to a stable phase at one of these points and as we <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the flow diagram on the right, the longitudinal conductivity will vanish and the Hall conductivity takes on a quantized value. If we started with a Hall conductivity that is halfway between two attractive points, we would end up on the phase transition between topological sectors. As long as the symmetry isn't broken, the longitudinal conductivity doesn't vanish and is even able to increase when scaling to a larger system size. In the flow diagram, we see fixed points that are repulsive {{in the direction of the}} Hall current and attractive in the direction of the longitudinal current. It is most interesting to approach these fixed saddle points as close as possible and measure the (universal) behavior of the quantum Hall transitions.|$|E
