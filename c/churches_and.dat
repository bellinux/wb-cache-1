5|$|The three-week {{siege of}} Marash was also {{accompanied}} by the wholesale massacre of the Armenian repatriates. Roving Turkish bands threw kerosene-doused rags on Armenian homes and laid a constant barrage upon the American relief hospital. The Armenians themselves, as in previous times of trouble, sought refuge in their <b>churches</b> <b>and</b> schools. Women and children found momentary shelter in Marash's six Armenian Apostolic, three Armenian Evangelical <b>churches</b> <b>and</b> in the city's sole Catholic cathedral. The Armenian legionnaires attempted {{to put up a}} defense but were ultimately overwhelmed. All the <b>churches</b> <b>and</b> eventually the entire Armenian districts were put to flames. The plight of the Armenians was only exacerbated when the French decided to pull out on 10 February. When the 2,000 Armenians who had taken shelter in the Catholic cathedral attempted to follow the retreat, they were cut down by Turkish rifle and machine gun fire.|$|E
