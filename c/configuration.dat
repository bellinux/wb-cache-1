5|$|Because each <b>configuration</b> {{has only}} a bounded number of predecessors, the {{evolution}} of Rule 90 preserves the entropy of any <b>configuration.</b> In particular, if an infinite initial <b>configuration</b> is selected by choosing the state of each cell independently at random, {{with each of the}} two states being equally likely to be selected, then each subsequent <b>configuration</b> can be described by exactly the same probability distribution.|$|E
5|$|Every <b>configuration</b> of Rule 90 has exactly four predecessors, other {{configurations}} {{that form}} the given <b>configuration</b> after a single step. Therefore, in contrast to many other cellular automata such as Conway's Game of Life, Rule 90 has no Garden of Eden, a <b>configuration</b> with no predecessors.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of intensified simple column <b>configurations</b> (ISC) for multicomponent distillations is presented. The ISC <b>configurations</b> use less columns and less heat exchangers {{than the traditional}} distillation <b>configurations</b> (TDC), while they keep the similar structural simplicity as the TDC <b>configurations</b> that each column produces an overhead product with a condenser and a bottoms product with a reboiler. For an N-component zeotropic mixture, an easy-to-use procedure is first formulated to generate the ISC <b>configurations</b> from the simple column <b>configurations</b> (SC) with only sharp splits. Then, the procedure is generalized to produce the ISC <b>configurations</b> from any traditional distillation <b>configurations</b> (TDC) with both sharp and sloppy splits. It is demonstrated that the procedure can explicitly modify the TDC <b>configurations</b> step-by-step to systematically generate all the possible ISC <b>configurations.</b> The ISC <b>configurations</b> {{have the potential to}} reduce both energy consumption and capital costs than the TDC <b>configurations,</b> at the same time, they have the similar structural simplicity in terms of systems design, control and operation as the traditional distillation <b>configurations.</b> Therefore, they constitute an advantageous alternatives subspace when looking for an optimal system for a specific application in both new design and retrofit of distillation plants...|$|R

5|$|In 1988, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} led by Eichler calculated that lawrencium's enthalpy of adsorption on metal sources would differ enough depending on its electron <b>configuration</b> that it would be feasible to carry out experiments to exploit this fact to measure lawrencium's electron <b>configuration.</b> The s2p <b>configuration</b> was expected to be more volatile than the s2d <b>configuration,</b> and be more {{similar to that of the}} p-block element lead. No evidence for lawrencium being volatile was obtained and the lower limit for the enthalpy of adsorption of lawrencium on quartz or platinum was significantly higher than the estimated value for the s2p <b>configuration.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Rule 90, on an {{infinite}} one-dimensional lattice, every <b>configuration</b> has exactly four predecessor configurations. This is because, in a predecessor, any two consecutive cells may have {{any combination of}} states, but once those two cells' states are chosen, {{there is only one}} consistent choice for the states of the remaining cells. Therefore, there is no Garden of Eden in Rule 90, a <b>configuration</b> with no predecessors. The Rule 90 <b>configuration</b> consisting of a single nonzero cell (with all other cells zero) has no predecessors that have finitely many nonzeros. However, this <b>configuration</b> is not a Garden of Eden because it does have predecessors with infinitely many nonzeros.|$|E

5|$|A {{complete}} explanation of mercury's extreme volatility delves {{deep into the}} realm of quantum physics, but it can be summarized as follows: mercury has a unique electron <b>configuration</b> where electrons fill up all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s subshells.

5|$|A {{lawrencium}} atom has 103 electrons, {{of which}} three {{can act as}} valence electrons. In 1970, {{it was predicted that}} the ground-state electron <b>configuration</b> of lawrencium was 5f146d17s2 (ground state term symbol 2D3/2), following the Aufbau principle and conforming to the 4f145d16s2 <b>configuration</b> of lawrencium's lighter homolog lutetium. However, the next year, calculations were published that questioned this prediction, instead expecting an anomalous 5f147s27p1 <b>configuration.</b> Though early calculations gave conflicting results, more recent studies and calculations confirm the s2p suggestion. 1974 relativistic calculations concluded that the energy difference between the two configurations was small and that it was uncertain which was the ground state. Later 1995 calculations concluded that the s2p <b>configuration</b> should be energetically favored, because the spherical s and p1/2 orbitals are nearest to the atomic nucleus and thus move quickly enough that their relativistic mass increases significantly.|$|E
5|$|A {{neptunium}} atom has 93 electrons, {{arranged in}} the <b>configuration</b> 5f46d17s2. This {{differs from the}} <b>configuration</b> expected by the Aufbau principle in that one electron is in the 6d subshell instead of being as expected in the 5f subshell. This {{is because of the}} similarity of the electron energies of the 5f, 6d, and 7s subshells. In forming compounds and ions, all the valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind an inert core of inner electrons with the electron <b>configuration</b> of the noble gas radon; more commonly, only some of the valence electrons will be lost. The electron <b>configuration</b> for the tripositive ion Np3+ is 5f4, with the outermost 7s and 6d electrons lost first: this is exactly analogous to neptunium's lanthanide homolog promethium, and conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. The first ionization potential of neptunium was measured to be at most (6.19±0.12)eV in 1974, {{based on the assumption that}} the 7s electrons would ionize before 5f and 6d; more recent measurements have refined this to 6.2657eV.|$|E

A 2016 calculation on unbiunium monofluoride (UbuF) showed similarities between the valence orbitals of unbiunium in this molecule and those of actinium in actinium monofluoride (AcF); in both molecules, the highest occupied molecular orbital is expected to be nonbonding, unlike in the superficially more similar nihonium monofluoride (NhF) where it is bonding. Nihonium has the electron <b>configuration</b> 5f146d107s27p1, with an s2p valence <b>configuration.</b> Unbiunium may hence be somewhat like lawrencium in having an anomalous s2p <b>configuration</b> from relativistic effects that does not affect its chemistry: the bond dissociation energies, bond lengths, and polarisabilities of the UbuF molecule are expected to continue the trend down group 3. Hence lawrencium and unbiunium are expected to be similar to lutetium and actinium respectively, and not thallium and nihonium as would be expected from looking at their electron configurations.
