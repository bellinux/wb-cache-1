25|$|This is {{a matter}} of vital {{importance}} because a problem of economic development is identifying the membership of customary landowning groups and the owners. Disputes between mining and forestry companies and landowner groups often devolve on the issue of whether the companies entered into <b>contractual</b> <b>relations</b> for the use of land with the true owners. Customary property — usually land — cannot be devised by will. It can only be inherited according to the custom of the deceased's people. The Lands Act was amended in 2010 along with the Land Group Incorporation Act, intended to improve the management of state land, mechanisms for dispute resolution over land, and to enable customary landowners to be better able to access finance and possible partnerships over portions of their land, if they seek to develop it for urban or rural economic activities. The Land Group Incorporation Act requires more specific identification of the customary landowners than hitherto and their more specific authorisation before any land arrangements are determined; (a major issue {{in recent years has been}} a land grab, using, or rather misusing, the Lease-Leaseback provision under the Land Act, notably using 'Special Agricultural and Business Leases' (SABLs) to acquire vast tracts of customary land, purportedly for agricultural projects, but in an almost all cases as a back-door mechanism for securing tropical forest resources for logging — circumventing the more exacting requirements of the Forest Act, for securing Timber Permits (which must comply with sustainability requirements and be competitively secured, and with the customary landowners approval). Following a national outcry, these SABLs have been subject to a Commission of Inquiry, established in mid-2011, for which the report is still awaited for initial presentation to the Prime Minister and Parliament.|$|E
40|$|Several {{national}} health systems in Latin America embarked on health reforms to tackle widespread criticisms for low equity and efficiency. These reforms have included contracting by public purchasing agencies of external providers. This paper seeks to propose an analytical framework to support {{decision making and}} orient future search for evidences. It was built upon a literature review and four illustrations from Costa Rica Guatemala, Nicaragua and Salvador which focus on primary care providers. A preliminary literature review helped in proposing an initial framework with basic dimensions. Thereafter, we used four illustrations of <b>contractual</b> <b>relation</b> between public purchasers and external primary care providers in Central America to further develop the framework. Two types of themes emerged. The first group corresponds to choices {{that need to be}} done in the design of the <b>contractual</b> <b>relation.</b> Theses choices are not only technical but also value-based. The second group is mostly beyond the control of the <b>contractual</b> <b>relation</b> designers, or includes unexpected consequences of the <b>contractual</b> <b>relation.</b> Our framework would need further development. It might help however in designing more adequate processes and tools in assisting future decision in contracting or not external providers for primary care...|$|R

30|$|In an {{ordinary}} <b>contractual</b> <b>relation</b> diverse contingencies {{may lead to}} disputes between the contractual partners that may be best solved by an arbitrator or {{an ordinary}} court. For those contractual disputes it is pivotal that they typically occur infrequently and that they usually terminate the <b>contractual</b> <b>relation</b> by sorting out the invested assets and accrued profits. That is different with regard to meta-organizations where a whole network of contracts is established {{and the purpose of}} the meta-organization is specified in less detail than in an ordinary business contract. Insofar as meta-organizations are more similar to a company where the business strategy, product portfolio etc. are also not specified in the corporate contract itself, but the business strategy {{is the result of the}} whole business activity over time. But apparently a meta-organization is also not a regular company with a clearly defined hierarchy, because it has no board that holds the whole bundle of residual property rights and can take decisions independently. Hence the coordination of assets remains the weak spot of meta-organizations.|$|R

In addition, {{they are required to}} comply with a Code of Conduct for Ministers. For example, to counter potential allegations of corruption and unexplained wealth and to avoid potential conflicts between private interests and public responsibilities, the Code requires every Minister, upon appointment to office, to disclose in confidence to the President through the Prime Minister all sources of income other than his salary as a Minister and as an MP. This must include all assets, such as financial assets, real property, interests in any company or professional practice, and any other substantial personal assets as well as financial liabilities, including mortgages and borrowings. A Minister must also [...] "scrupulously avoid any actual or apparent conflict of interest between his office and his private financial interests". Thus, a Minister is not permitted to accept any favour of any kind from persons in negotiation with, or seeking to obtain any licence or enter into any <b>contractual</b> <b>relations</b> with, the Government, or to use official information that comes to him as a Minister for his own private profit or the profit of any family member or associate.|$|E

40|$|Several {{national}} health systems in Latin America initiated health reforms to counter widespread criticisms of low equity and efficiency. For public purchasing agencies, these reforms often consisted in contracting external providers for primary care provision. This paper intends to clarify both {{the complex and}} intertwined issues characterizing such contracting as well as health system performances {{within the context of}} four Central American countries. It results from a European Commission financed project lead between 2002 and 2005, involving participants from Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Salvador, United Kingdom, Netherlands and Belgium, whose aim was to promote exchanges between these participants. The findings presented in this paper are the results of a two stage process: (a) the design of an initial analytical framework, built upon findings from the literature, interlinking characteristics of <b>contractual</b> <b>relation</b> with health systems performances criteria and (b) the use of that framework in four case studies to identify cross-cutting issues. This paper reinforces two pivotal findings: (a) contracting requires not only technical, but also political choices and (b) it cannot be considered as a mechanical process. The unpredictability of its evolution requires a flexible and reactive approach. This should be better assimilated by national and international organizations involved in health services provision, so as to progressively come out of dogmatic approaches in deciding to initiate <b>contractual</b> <b>relation</b> with external providers for primary care provision. ...|$|R

[...] Economics, in principle, assumes that conflict is reduced by agreeing on voluntary <b>contractual</b> <b>relations</b> and prices instead of simply fighting or coercing or tricking others into providing goods or services. [...] In doing so, a provider agrees to surrender time and take bodily risks and other (reputation, financial) risks.

50|$|A key {{concept of}} Rational Choice Institutionalism is the principal-agent model {{borrowed}} from Neo-classical economics. The concept {{assumes that the}} principal enters into a <b>contractual</b> <b>relation</b> with a second party, the agent, and delegates responsibility to the latter to fulfil certain responsibilities or a set of tasks {{on behalf of the}} principal. Problems occur due to an asymmetric distribution of information which favours the agent. The latter enables the agent to pursue its own interest and engage in opportunistic behaviour - shirking - at the cost of the principal’s interest. The principal’s problem is how to control and limit shirking by the agent.|$|R

2500|$|C. B. Macpherson {{identifies}} {{an underlying}} {{model of the}} market underlying Anglo-American liberal-democratic political economy and philosophy in {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries: persons are cast as self-interested individuals, who enter into <b>contractual</b> <b>relations</b> with other such individuals, concerning the exchange of goods or personal capacities cast as commodities, with the motive of maximizing pecuniary interest. The state and its governance systems are cast as outside of this framework. This model came to dominant economic thinking in the later nineteenth century, as economists such as Ricardo, Mill, Jevons, Walras and later neo-classical economics shifted from reference to geographically located marketplaces to an abstract [...] "market". This tradition is continued in contemporary neoliberalism, where the market is held up as optimal for wealth creation and human freedom, and the states' role imagined as minimal, reduced to that of upholding and keeping stable property rights, contract, and money supply. According to David Harvey, this allowed for boilerplate economic and institutional restructuring under structural adjustment and post-Communist reconstruction. Similar formalism occurs {{in a wide variety of}} social democratic and Marxist discourses that situate political action as antagonistic to the market. In particular, commodification theorists such as György Lukács insist that market relations necessarily lead to undue exploitation of labour and so need to be opposed in toto.|$|E
2500|$|Macneil's theory {{posits that}} the {{traditional}} approach of doctrinal contract law in the common law countries, which he calls [...] "classical" [...] and [...] "neoclassical", which concentrates on [...] "the deal" [...] at its time of making, and treats individual contracts as discrete entities, is an inadequate and inaccurate tool {{for the study of}} contracts. He argues that all contracts are in fact not discrete at all but belong in the context of complex webs of exchange relations. This theory {{can be seen as a}} counter to both the [...] "death of contract" [...] idea, that contract as a separate idea was no longer relevant and that breach of contract is best regarded just as another tort (civil wrong), most closely associated with Grant Gilmore, and to Legal formalism in contract, in which the approach is to ignore, to a large extent, contextual matters surrounding the contract and concentrate only on the express terms and a strictly limited range of implied terms (though Robert E. Scott has argued that a formalist approach can still work within the context of an acceptance of a relational view of contract). Contract relations fall along a spectrum from the highly relational (e.g., long-term employment contracts) to the [...] "as if discrete", largely transactionalised relation (e.g., spot purchases of commodities). All relations, though, are connected with and belong within a broader social context, with which successful relations must be harmonised. It is possible to draw axes through many facets of <b>contractual</b> <b>relations,</b> indicating the likely features of such facets in relations falling at different points along the spectrum.|$|E
2500|$|This is {{the reason}} for the {{frequent}} choice of the law of the State of New York in commercial contracts, even when neither entity has extensive contacts with New York—and remarkably often even when neither party has contacts with the United States. Commercial contracts almost always include a [...] "choice of law clause" [...] to reduce uncertainty. Somewhat surprisingly, contracts throughout the world (for example, contracts involving parties in Japan, France and Germany, and from most of the other states of the United States) often choose the law of New York, even where the relationship of the parties and transaction to New York is quite attenuated. Because of its history as the United States' commercial center, New York common law has a depth and predictability not (yet) available in any other jurisdictions of the United States. Similarly, American corporations are often formed under Delaware corporate law, and American contracts relating to corporate law issues (merger and acquisitions of companies, rights of shareholders, and so on.) include a Delaware choice of law clause, because of the deep body of law in Delaware on these issues. On the other hand, some other jurisdictions have sufficiently developed bodies of law so that parties have no real motivation to choose the law of a foreign jurisdiction (for example, England and Wales, and the state of California), but not yet so fully developed that parties with no relationship to the jurisdiction choose that law. Outside the United States, parties that are in different jurisdictions from each other often choose the law of England and Wales, particularly when the parties are each in former British colonies and members of the Commonwealth. The common theme in all cases is that commercial parties seek predictability and simplicity in their <b>contractual</b> <b>relations,</b> and frequently choose the law of a common law jurisdiction with a well-developed body of common law to achieve that result.|$|E
