5000|$|Self-lubricating composites: Solid {{lubricants}} such as PTFE, graphite, MoS2 {{and some}} other anti-friction and anti-wear additives are often <b>compounded</b> <b>in</b> polymers and all kind of sintered materials. MoS2, for example, is <b>compounded</b> <b>in</b> materials for sleeve bearings, elastomer O-rings, carbon brushes, etc. Solid lubricants are <b>compounded</b> <b>in</b> plastics to form a [...] "self-lubricating" [...] or [...] "internally lubricated" [...] thermoplastic composite. For example, PTFE particles <b>compounded</b> <b>in</b> the plastic form a PTFE film over the mating surface, resulting in a reduction of friction and wear. MoS2 <b>compounded</b> <b>in</b> nylon reduces wear, friction and stick-slip. Furthermore, it acts as a nucleating agent effecting in a very fine crystalline structure. The primary use of graphite lubricated thermoplastics is in applications operating in aqueous environments.|$|R

5|$|Hundreds of {{compounds}} {{have been identified}} using ethnobotany, investigating plants used by indigenous peoples for possible medical applications. Some important phytochemicals, including curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, genistein and resveratrol are pan-assay interference compounds, meaning that in vitro studies of their activity often provide unreliable data. As a result, phytochemicals have frequently proven unsuitable as lead <b>compounds</b> <b>in</b> drug discovery.|$|E
5|$|In plants, {{nitrogen}} {{is first}} assimilated into organic <b>compounds</b> <b>in</b> {{the form of}} glutamate, formed from alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia in the mitochondrion. In order to form other amino acids, the plant uses transaminases to move the amino group to another alpha-keto carboxylic acid. For example, aspartate aminotransferase converts glutamate and oxaloacetate to alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate. Other organisms use transaminases for amino acid synthesis, too.|$|E

5|$|Lead shows {{two main}} {{oxidation}} states: +4 and +2. The tetravalent state {{is common for}} the carbon group. The divalent state is rare for carbon and silicon, minor for germanium, important (but not prevailing) for tin, and is the more important for lead. This is attributable to relativistic effects, specifically the inert pair effect, which manifests itself {{when there is a}} large difference in electronegativity between lead and oxide, halide, or nitride anions, leading to a significant partial positive charge on lead. The result is a stronger contraction of the lead 6s orbital than is the case for the 6p orbital, making it rather inert in ionic compounds. This is less applicable to <b>compounds</b> <b>in</b> which lead forms covalent bonds with elements of similar electronegativity such as carbon in organolead <b>compounds.</b> <b>In</b> these, the 6s and 6p orbitals remain similarly sized and sp3 hybridization is still energetically favorable. Lead, like carbon, is predominantly tetravalent in such compounds.|$|E

5|$|The +4 {{oxidation}} state dominates titanium chemistry, but <b>compounds</b> <b>in</b> the +3 {{oxidation state}} are also common.
