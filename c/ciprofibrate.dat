40|$|International audienceCiprofibrate is a {{well-known}} drug used to normalize lipid parameters and fibrinogen in atherosclerosis patients. In laboratory rodents such as rats or mice, <b>ciprofibrate</b> exhibits peroxisome proliferator activity. However, to date, no clear alterations or side effects caused by <b>ciprofibrate</b> have been noted in humans. In order to further investigate such possible relationships, we studied the effects of sustained <b>ciprofibrate</b> treatment in jerboas (Jaculus orientalis). In these rodents, <b>ciprofibrate</b> does not induce hepatomegaly or promote liver cell DNA replication, confirming that this species more closely resembles humans than do rats or mice. The jerboas were treated daily with <b>ciprofibrate</b> at 3 mg/kg body weight for 4 weeks. Subcellular markers, clinical enzymes and enzymatic antioxidant defenses were then assessed. The results showed a strong decrease in peroxisomal catalase activity {{and an increase in}} the level of malondialdehyde (a stress biomarker). Moreover, <b>ciprofibrate</b> in vivo and in vitro inhibited D- 3 -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial enzyme of the ketone body interconversion that is important in redox balance (NAD+/NADH+H+ ratio).

Here, we analyzed the response to <b>ciprofibrate</b> in mice that lack the NF-�B p 50 gene (p 50 –/ –). Wild-type and p 50 –/ – mice were fed a diet with or without 0. 01 % <b>ciprofibrate</b> for 10 days. NF-�B DNA binding activity was present and increased after <b>ciprofibrate</b> treatment in wild-type mice, but was not detected in p 50 –/ – mice.

However, the increase in proliferation was greater in ciprofibrate-fed wild-type mice than in ciprofibrate-fed p 50 –/ – mice. The apoptotic index was low in wildtype mice in {{the presence or absence of}} <b>ciprofibrate.</b> Apoptosis was increased in untreated p 50 –/– mice compared to wild-type mice; apoptosis was reduced in p 50 –/– mice after <b>ciprofibrate</b> feeding. The c-Jun and JunB mRNA levels were higher in untreated p 50 –/– mice than in untreated control mice; c-Jun mRNA levels increased, whereas JunB mRNA levels decreased in both groups after <b>ciprofibrate</b> treatment. The c-Jun and JunB protein levels were the same in untreated wild-type and p 50 –/– mice and increased in both groups after <b>ciprofibrate</b> treatment. Several apoptosis-related mRNAs were higher in untreated p 50 –/ – mice compared to untreated control mice; expression of these genes increased in both groups after <b>ciprofibrate</b> treatment.

40|$|The {{effects of}} feeding the {{peroxisome}} proliferators <b>ciprofibrate</b> (a hypolipidaemic analogue of clofibrate) or POCA (2 -[5 -(4 -chlorophenyl) pentyl]oxirane- 2 -carboxylate) (an inhibitor of CPT I) to rats for 5 {{days on the}} distribution of carnitine and acylcarnitine esters between liver, plasma and muscle and on hepatic CoA concentrations (free and acylated) and activities of carnitine acetyltransferase and acyl-CoA hydrolases were determined. <b>Ciprofibrate</b> and POCA increased hepatic [total CoA] by 2 and 2. 5 times respectively, and [total carnitine] by 4. 4 and 1. 9 times respectively, but decreased plasma [carnitine] by 36 - 46 %. POCA had no effect on either urinary excretion of acylcarnitine esters or [acylcarnitine] in skeletal muscle. By contrast, <b>ciprofibrate</b> decreased [acylcarnitine] and [total carnitine] in muscle. In liver, <b>ciprofibrate</b> increased the [carnitine]/[CoA] ratio and caused a larger increase in [acylcarnitine] (7 -fold) than in [carnitine] (4 -fold), thereby increasing the [short-chain acylcarnitine]/[carnitine] ratio. POCA did not affect the [carnitine]/[CoA] and the [short-chain acylcarnitine]/[carnitine] ratios, but it decreased the [long-chain acylcarnitine]/[carnitine] ratio. <b>Ciprofibrate</b> and POCA increased the activities of acyl-CoA hydrolases, and carnitine acetyltransferase activity was increased 28 -fold and 6 -fold by <b>ciprofibrate</b> and POCA respectively. In cultures of hepatocytes, <b>ciprofibrate</b> caused similar changes in enzyme activity to those observed in vivo, although [carnitine] decreased with time. The results suggest that: (1) the reactions catalysed by the short-chain carnitine acyltransferases, but not by the carnitine palmitoyltransferases, are near equilibrium in liver both before and after modification of metabolism by administration of <b>ciprofibrate</b> or POCA; (2) the increase in hepatic [carnitine] after <b>ciprofibrate</b> or POCA feeding can be explained by redistribution of carnitine between tissues; (3) the activity of carnitine acetyltransferase and [total carnitine] in liver are closely related...|$|E

Hepatic bilirubin glucuronidation activity and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase expression (RT-PCR and Western blotting) were measured after a single-dose <b>ciprofibrate</b> treatment (5  mg/kg by gastric intubation) in 36 -h time course experiments. <b>Ciprofibrate</b> regulation of PPARα and UGT 1 A 5 mRNA expression was also investigated in rat hepatocytes. Bilirubin conjugation activity was induced by <b>ciprofibrate,</b> reaching a maximum level (2. 4 ×) 24  h after the treatment. UGT 1 A 1 and UGT 1 A 5 mRNA expression was induced 1. 5 times by <b>ciprofibrate,</b> with UGT 1 A 5 reaching the basal level of UGT 1 A 1. Although UGT 1 A 2 mRNA was induced approximately threefold by <b>ciprofibrate,</b> its expression level remained low in comparison with basal or induced levels of UGT 1 A 1 and UGT 1 A 5 mRNA. In the 36 -h time course experiment, bilirubin conjugation activity as well as UGT 1 A 5 and PPARα mRNA expression presented a biphasic induction profile.

40|$|Abstract Background CETP is a {{plasma protein}} that modulates {{atherosclerosis}} risk through its HDL-cholesterol reducing action. The {{aim of this}} work {{was to examine the}} effect of the PPARα agonist, <b>ciprofibrate,</b> on the CETP gene expression, in the presence and absence of apolipoprotein (apo) CIII induced hypertriglyceridemia, {{and its impact on the}} HDL metabolism. Results Mice expressing apo CIII and/or CETP and non-transgenic littermates (CIII, CIII/CETP, CETP, non-Tg) were treated with <b>ciprofibrate</b> during 3 weeks. Drug treatment reduced plasma triglycerides (30 - 43 %) and non-esterified fatty acids (19 - 47 %) levels. Cholesterol (chol) distribution in plasma lipoprotein responses to <b>ciprofibrate</b> treatment was dependent on the genotypes. Treated CIII expressing mice presented elevation in VLDL-chol and reduction in HDL-chol. Treated CETP expressing mice responded with reduction in LDL-chol whereas in non-Tg mice the LDL-chol increased. In addition, <b>ciprofibrate</b> increased plasma post heparin lipoprotein lipase activity (1. 3 - 2. 1 fold) in all groups but hepatic lipase activity decreased in treated CETP and non-Tg mice. Plasma CETP activity and liver CETP mRNA levels were significantly increased in treated CIII/CETP and CETP mice (30 - 100 %). Kinetic studies with 3 H-cholesteryl ether (CEt) labelled HDL showed a 50 % reduction in the 3 H-CEt found in the LDL fraction in <b>ciprofibrate</b> treated compared to non-treated CETP mice. This means that 3 H-CEt transferred from HDL to LDL was more efficiently removed from the plasma in the fibrate treated mice. Accordingly, the amount of 3 H-CEt recovered in the liver 6 hours after HDL injection was increased by 35 %. Conclusion Together these data showed that the PPARα agonist <b>ciprofibrate</b> stimulates CETP gene expression and changes the cholesterol flow through the reverse cholesterol transport, increasing plasma cholesterol removal through LDL. </p...|$|E

Fasting plasma lipid levels and safety parameters were evaluated before and after treatment. One hundred milligrams ciprofibrate/day therapy {{was found to be}} approximately as effective as 200 mg fenofibrate HB/day therapy in altering the lipid profile.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the hypolipidemic drug <b>ciprofibrate</b> induces {{peroxisome}} proliferation in rodent liver, which in turn leads to the oxidative stress, and modifies some parameters related to cell proliferation and apoptosis.

Moreover, this modification was associated to about two-fold induction of mRNA-PPARalpha. On the contrary, in the kidney, although a similar two-fold up-regulation of PPARalpha was detected, the induction of both peroxisomal enzyme activities and Cyp 4 a 10 were weak, and no alterations were detected, neither in cell cycle nor {{in the size of the}} tissue.

40|$|An {{elevated}} plasma fibrinogen {{level is}} increasingly accepted {{as an independent}} risk indicator of cardiovascular disease. This has enhanced the interest in identifying agents that can normalize elevated plasma fibrinogen levels.

We studied fibrinogen levels after 12 weeks of treatment with <b>ciprofibrate</b> (n = 48) and gemfibrozil (n = 51) in hypercholesterolemic patients. The correlation of the decrease in fibrinogen with lipid lowering and {{the contribution of the}} acute phase and genetic polymorphisms to this decrease were also evaluated. After 12 weeks of treatment,the fibrinogen levels were significantly decreased (p < 0. 0005) with both drugs, although the decrease in the <b>ciprofibrate</b> group (mean 3. 4 g/l pre-treatment to 2. 4 g/l after 12 weeks) was larger than in the gemfibrozil group (mean 3. 4 g/l to 3. 0 g/l). The lipid lowering effect was comparable for the two drugs but there was no correlation for either <b>ciprofibrate</b> or gemfibrozil between the lipid lowering and the magnitude or the velocity of the fibrinogen lowering effect. An attenuation of the major regulatory mechanism of plasma fibrinogen levels, the acute phase reaction, was invoked as the underlying mechanism. However, pre-treatment C-reactive protein levels were not increased and did not change after treatment. Moreover, no effects of the polymorphisms of the fibrinogen β-gene on the decrease of the plasma fibrinogen levels were observed.

When administered at single doses over the same experimental period, blueberry and <b>ciprofibrate</b> were effective in lowering TG concentrations in ethanol-treated normolipidaemic animals and in genetically hyperlipidaemic Yoshida rats. Unlike <b>ciprofibrate,</b> however, blueberry failed to prevent the rise in plasma TG elicited by fructose and did not affect free fatty acid levels in any of the above experimental conditions. In rats treated with Triton WR- 1339, blueberry feeding induced an hypolipidaemic activity one hour after injection but proved to be ineffective at later time points, thus suggesting that its hypolipidaemic action may reflect improved TG-rich lipoprotein catabolism. In addition, <b>ciprofibrate</b> and the extract were tested for antithrombotic activity using a collagen-triggered model of venous thrombosis in diabetic and Yoshida rats. Only <b>ciprofibrate,</b> however, significantly reduced thrombus formation in diabetics, possibly because of its effects on free fatty acid metabolism, whereas no effect was observed in Yoshida rats.

Subsequent time course studies with <b>ciprofibrate</b> (100 mg kg- 1 day- 1) or methylclofenapate (25 mg kg- 1 day- 1) showed that liver-to-body weight ratio was significantly increased in treated groups by day 2, but that the induction of DNA synthesis was increased significantly only after three days of treatment, for both compounds. No induction of hepatic DNA synthesis was observed in PPARa null mice after treatment with <b>ciprofibrate</b> (100 mg kg- 1 day- 1) for 2 or 6 days, showing that the effect required the PPARa.

In order to explain the early time course of induction of DNA synthesis reported by Styles [113] [164] in Alderley Park mice, a time course study was performed between 1 - 4 days in Alderley park mice using methylclofenapate (25 mg kg- 1 day- 1). The study showed that liver growth was induced by day 2, but DNA synthesis was significantly induced only after 3 days of dosing. To evaluate species differences, the time-course of induction of DNA synthesis was examined in F- 344 rats treated with <b>ciprofibrate</b> (50 mg kg- 1 day- 1) for 1 - 4 days. The liver-to-body weight ratio was significantly increased in all time points, but DNA synthesis was significantly increased after 2 days of dosing. These findings demonstrate that there was a delay in induction of DNA synthesis by peroxisome proliferators in mouse by at least 48 hours. This delay in response is not due to strain differences. Moreover, induction of DNA synthesis in rat was earlier than those in mouse, which makes rats a feasible experimental model to study the immediate early genes/ proteins induced by peroxisome proliferators to induce liver growth.

40|$|After our {{previous}} {{report on the}} cloning of two cDNA species in guinea pig, both encoding the same hepatic 79 kDa multifunctional protein 1 (MFP- 1) [Caira, Cherkaoui-Malki, Hoefler and Latruffe (1996) FEBS Lett. 378, 57 - 60], here we report the cloning of a cDNA encoding a second multifunctional peroxisomal protein (MFP- 2) in guinea-pig liver. This 2356 nt cDNA encodes a protein of 735 residues (79. 7 kDa) whose sequence shows 83 % identity with rat MFP- 2 [Dieuaide-Noubhani, Novikov, Baumgart, Vanhooren, Fransen, Goethals, Vandekerckhove, Van Veldhoven and Mannaerts (1996) Eur. J. Biochem. 240, 660 - 666]. In parallel, we studied the effect of <b>ciprofibrate,</b> a hypolipaemic agent also known as peroxisome proliferator in rodent, on the expression of MFP- 1 and MFP- 2 (2. 6 kb) in rats and guinea pigs. By Northern blotting analysis we demonstrated that three MFP- 1 -related mRNA species are expressed in the guinea-pig liver. The expression of two of them (3. 5 and 2. 6 kb) is slightly increased by <b>ciprofibrate,</b> whereas the 3. 0 kb MFP- 1 mRNA is, unlike the rat one, strongly down-regulated in guinea pigs treated with <b>ciprofibrate.</b> In a similar way, the hepatic expression of the guinea-pig 2. 6 kb MFP- 2 mRNA is also down-regulated in guinea pigs treated with <b>ciprofibrate.</b> These results demonstrate (1) that {{in contrast with the}} unique 3. 0 kb MFP- 1 rat mRNA, at least three hepatic MFP- 1 -related mRNA species are co-expressed in guinea pig; and (2) that, opposed to the accepted idea of non-responsiveness of the guinea pig to <b>ciprofibrate,</b> this drug affects MFP- 1 and MFP- 2 gene expression in this species. Also, the mRNA species for acyl-CoA oxidase and thiolase, two other enzymes of the peroxisomal beta-oxidation pathway that are induced severalfold in responsive species are down-regulated in guinea pig.

40|$|Mice lacking apolipoprotein E (apoE) are {{characterized}} by severe hypercholesterolaemia, caused by an abnormal accumulation of apolipoprotein B- 48 (apoB- 48) -carrying remnants of chylomicrons and very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) in the plasma, and by the spontaneous development of atherosclerotic lesions. <b>Ciprofibrate</b> is a hypolipidaemic compound that acts primarily by enhancing the oxidation of fatty acids in the liver and, consequently, decreasing the production of hepatic VLDL. In the present study, homozygous apoE-deficient mice were fed with a normal chow diet, supplemented with <b>ciprofibrate.</b> We report that, as anticipated, <b>ciprofibrate</b> treatment (a) stimulated hepatic fatty acid oxidation, as indicated {{by an increase in}} the mRNA levels of peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX) and peroxisomal bifunctional enzyme, and (b) decreased the hepatic secretion of VLDL into the plasma, as determined by treating the animals with Triton WR- 1339. Paradoxically, the apoE-deficient mice developed a 3 - 4 -fold increase in their plasma cholesterol levels. A similar effect was observed in apoE-deficient mice treated with other peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor alpha agonists (fenofibrate, bezafibrate and WY 14, 643). By FPLC of the plasma and Western-blot analysis, we determined that the enhanced hypercholesterolaemia was due to an increased accumulation of apoB- 48 -carrying lipoprotein remnants in the plasma. Consistent with this finding, atherosclerotic lesions in animals treated with <b>ciprofibrate</b> for 90 days were considerably more advanced than in untreated animals. These results indicate that the ciprofibrate-induced accumulation of apoB- 48 -carrying remnants in apoE-deficient mice is caused by the inhibition of an as yet uncharacterized apoE-independent mechanism of removal of remnant from the circulation by the liver...|$|E
40|$|A rapid, {{sensitive}} and specific method for quantifying <b>ciprofibrate</b> in human plasma using bezafibrate as the internal standard (IS) is described. The sample was acidified prior extraction with formic acid (88 %). The analyte and the IS were extracted from plasma by liquid-liquid extraction using an organic solvent (diethyl ether/dichloromethane 70 / 30 (v/v)). The extracts {{were analyzed by}} high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Chromatography was performed using Genesis C 18 4 mu m analytical column (4. 6 x 150 mm i. d.) and a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile/water (70 / 30, v/v) and 1 mM acetic acid. The method had a chromatographic run time of 3. 4 min and a linear calibration curve over the range 0. 1 - 60 mu g/mL (r > 0. 99). The limit of quantification was 0. 1 mu g/mL. The intra- and interday accuracy and precision values of the assay were less than 13. 5 %. The stability tests indicated no significant degradation. The recovery of <b>ciprofibrate</b> was 81. 2 %, 73. 3 % and 76. 2 % for the 0. 3, 5. 0 and 48. 0 ng/mL standard concentrations, respectively. For <b>ciprofibrate,</b> the optimized parameters of the declustering potential, collision energy and collision exit potential were - 51 V, - 16 eV and - 5 V, respectively. The method was also validated {{without the use of}} the internal standard. This HPLC-MS/MS procedure was used to assess the bioequivalence of two <b>ciprofibrate</b> 100 mg tablet formulations in healthy volunteers of both sexes. The following pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained from the <b>ciprofibrate</b> plasma concentration vs. time curves: AUC(last), AUC(0 - 168 h), C(max) and T(max). The geometric mean with corresponding 90 % confidence interval (CI) for test/reference percent ratios were 93. 80 % (90 % CI = 88. 16 - 99. 79 %) for C(max), 98. 31 % (90 % CI = 94. 91 - 101. 83 %) for AUC(last) and 97. 67 % (90 % CI = 94. 45 - 101. 01 %) for AUC(0 - 168 h). Since the 90 % Cl for AUC(last), AUC(0 - 168 h) and C(max) ratios were within the 80 - 125 % interval proposed by the US FDA, it was concluded that <b>ciprofibrate</b> (Lipless (R) 100 mg tablet) formulation manufactured by Biolab Sanus Farmaceutica Ltda. is bioequivalent to the Oroxadin (R) (100 mg tablet) formulation for both the rate and the extent of absorption.

40|$|<b>Ciprofibrate,</b> a {{hypolipidemic drug}} {{that acts as}} a {{peroxisome}} proliferator, induces the transcription of genes encoding peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzymes. To identify cis-acting promoter elements involved in this induction, 5. 8 kilobase pairs of promoter sequence from the gene encoding rat peroxisomal enoyl-CoA hydratase/ 3 -hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 4. 2. 1. 17 /EC 1. 1. 1. 35) was inserted upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. Transfection of this expression vector into rat hepatoma H 4 IIEC 3 cells in the presence of <b>ciprofibrate</b> resulted in a 5 - to 10 -fold, cell type-specific increase in luciferase activity as compared to cells transfected in the absence of drug. A peroxisome proliferator-responsive element (PPRE) was localized to a 196 -nucleotide region centered at position - 2943 from the transcription start site. This PPRE conferred <b>ciprofibrate</b> responsiveness on a heterologous promoter and functioned independently of orientation or position. Gel retardation analysis with nuclear extracts demonstrated that ciprofibrate-treated or untreated H 4 IIEC 3 cells, but not HeLa cells or monkey kidney cells, contained sequence-specific DNA binding factors that interact with the PPRE.

40|$|Fibrates are hypolipidemic {{drugs that}} affect the {{expression}} of genes involved in lipid metabolism by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Fibrate treatment causes adverse changes in biliary lipid composition and decreases bile acid excretion, leading to an increased incidence of cholesterol gallstones. In this study, we investigated the effect of fibrates on bile acid synthesis. <b>Ciprofibrate</b> and the PPAR alpha agonist Wy 14, 643 decreased bile acid synthesis in cultured rat hepatocytes and suppressed cholesterol 7 alpha -hydroxylase and sterol 27 -hydroxylase activities, paralleled by a similar reduction of the respective mRNAs. Treatment of rats with 0. 05 % (wt/wt) <b>ciprofibrate</b> decreased cholesterol 7 alpha -hydroxylase enzyme activity and mRNA. The functional involvement of PPARa in the suppression of both enzymes was proven {{with the use of}} PPAR alpha -null mice. In wild-type mice, <b>ciprofibrate</b> reduced cholesterol 7 alpha -hydroxylase and sterol 27 -hydroxylase enzyme activities and mRNA.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into two main chapters. The first chapter relates to studies {{undertaken}} to gain insights into the mechanism of action on liver growth by the peroxisome proliferator (PP) <b>ciprofibrate</b> and the chemical cyproterone acetate (CPA) in rodents. Peroxisome proliferators are a class of chemicals that have diverse effects in rats and mice including increased DNA synthesis and peroxisome proliferation. Peroxisome proliferators include herbicides, plasticisers, hypolipidemic drugs and synthetic fatty acids. These chemicals act through ligand activation of nuclear membrane receptors termed ‘peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptors’ (PPARs), which ultimately activate nuclear transcription. PPs induce a cellular process in liver characterised by dramatic increases in the size and number of peroxisomes, correlated with both hepatocyte hypertrophy (i. e. an increase in the size of liver cells) and hyperplasia (i. e. {{an increase in the number}} of liver cells during replicative DNA synthesis and cell division). However, the mechanism of action of increased hepatocyte growth is not currently understood. Understanding the mechanism by which increased liver growth is induced by PPs in rodents will hopefully provide insights into how natural liver growth occurs and might have medical benefits for human health if the mechanism of PP toxicity can be overcome. Knowledge gained from the mechanism of PP activation might also then be applied to other chemical carcinogens. Therefore, firstly the mode of action of the peroxisome proliferator <b>ciprofibrate</b> was investigated. Previous work had indicated that two successive doses of <b>ciprofibrate</b> treatment separated by 24 hr led to two rounds of liver cell replication, but it was not clear whether the same or different hepatocytes were involved in this growth response. To study this phenomenon, histochemical experimental work was undertaken to assess whether the same or different hepatocyte cells were stained during the two rounds of cell division following <b>ciprofibrate</b> treatment. The two histochemical stains used were EdU and BrdU, which are both base-pair analogues that stain nuclei undergoing DNA replication. It was hypothesized that if EdU was used to stain cells at 24 hr and then BrdU at 48 hr, that if the same cells were responding to <b>ciprofibrate</b> treatment then cells would be co-stained by both dyes, whereas if different cells were responding then there would be little or no double staining of hepatocyte cells. It was found that different cells were stained by the two dyes, indicating that <b>ciprofibrate</b> treatment was targeting different cells. Secondly, the mode of action of the carcinogen cyproterone acetate (CPA) on hepatocyte growth was investigated. Previous work had investigated the effects of CPA on hepatocyte growth in male and female rats and had suggested differences in response between the sexes. In the present study female rats were treated with CPA, to assess whether differences in labelling indices were present compared to previous male results. Female F- 344 /NHsd rats, aged 14 - 15 weeks, were treated with CPA and then injected with BrdU at 22 hr, and rats were killed 2 hr later. Results confirmed that the female rats had a considerably higher labelling index (50...|$|E

40|$|The {{structurally}} diverse peroxisome proliferators <b>ciprofibrate,</b> clofibrate, and bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate [(EtHx) 2 {{greater than}} Pht] increase {{the activities of}} hepatic catalase and peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation enzymes in conjunction with profound proliferation of peroxisomes in hepatocytes. In order to delineate {{the level at which}} these enzymes are induced in the liver, the transcriptional activity of specific genes for fatty acyl-CoA oxidase (FAOxase) and enoyl-CoA hydratase/ 3 -hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase bifunctional enzyme (PBE), the first two enzymes of the peroxisomal beta-oxidation system, and for catalase were measured in isolated hepatocyte nuclei obtained from male rats following a single intragastric dose of <b>ciprofibrate,</b> clofibrate, or (EtHx) 2 greater than Pht. All three peroxisome proliferators rapidly increased the rate of FAOxase and PBE gene transcription in liver, with near maximal rates (9 - 15 times control) reached by 1 hr and persisting until at least 16 hr after administration of the compound. FAOxase and PBE mRNA levels, measured by blot-hybridization analysis and FAOxase and PBE protein content, analyzed by immunoblotting, increased concurrently up to at least 16 hr following a single dose of peroxisome proliferator. The catalase mRNA level increased about 1. 4 -fold, but the transcription rate of the catalase gene was not significantly affected. The results show that the peroxisome proliferators clofibrate, <b>ciprofibrate,</b> and (EtHx) 2 greater than Pht selectively increase the rate of transcription of peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation enzyme genes. Whether the transcriptional effects are mediated by peroxisome proliferator-receptor complexes remains to be elucidated...|$|E

In this report, we show that the orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TF also displays affinity for the ME-PPRE and competes with PPAR alpha/RXR alpha for binding to this element. In transient transfections of a reporter driven by the MRE-PPRE in a heterologous or in the homologous promoter context, COUP-TF strongly antagonizes the transactivation by PPAR alpha RXR alpha {{in the absence of}} exogenously added ligands. Although 9 -cis RA did not further enhance the transcriptional effects of the heterodimers activated by <b>ciprofibrate,</b> it greatly impaired the suppressive effects of COUP-TF on the <b>ciprofibrate</b> activated PPAR alpha/RXR alpha.
