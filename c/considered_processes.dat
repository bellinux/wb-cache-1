40|$|Advanced process {{technologies}} {{call for}} a proactive consideration of process variations in design to ensure high parametric timing yield. Despite of its popular use in almost any high performance IC designs nowadays, however, buffer insertion has not gained enough attention in addressing this issue. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for buffer insertion to <b>consider</b> <b>process</b> variations. The major contribution of this work is two-fold: (1) an efficient technique to handle correlated process variations under nonlinear operations; (2) a provable transitive closure pruning rule that makes linear complexity variation-aware pruning possible. The proposed techniques enable an efficient implementation of variationaware buffer insertion. Compared to an existing algorithm <b>considering</b> <b>process</b> variations, our algorithm achieves more than 25 × speed-up. We also show that compared to the conventional deterministic approach, the proposed buffer insertion algorithm <b>considering</b> correlated <b>process</b> variations improves the parametric timing yield by more than 15 %...|$|R

40|$|We have {{recently}} defined a weak Markovian bisimulation equivalence in an integrated-time setting, which reduces sequences of exponentially timed internal actions to individual exponentially timed internal actions {{having the same}} average duration and execution probability as the corresponding sequences. This weak Markovian bisimulation equivalence is a congruence for sequential processes with abstraction and turns out to induce an exact CTMC-level aggregation at steady state for all the <b>considered</b> <b>processes.</b> However, {{it is not a}} congruence with respect to parallel composition. In this paper, we show how to generalize the equivalence in a way that a reasonable tradeoff among abstraction, compositionality, and exactness is achieved for concurrent processes. We will see that, by enhancing the abstraction capability in the presence of concurrent computations, it is possible to retrieve the congruence property with respect to parallel composition, with the resulting CTMC-level aggregation being exact at steady state only for a certain subset of the <b>considered</b> <b>processes.</b> ...|$|E
