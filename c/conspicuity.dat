This function is used when parking in narrow unlit streets to provide parked-vehicle <b>conspicuity</b> to approaching drivers. This function, which is optional under UN and US regulations, is served passively and without power consumption in the United States by the mandatory side marker retroreflectors.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of twin rear {{fog lamps}} say two lamps provide vehicle {{distance}} information not available from a single lamp. Proponents of the single rear fog lamp say dual {{rear fog lamps}} closely mimic the appearance of illuminated stop lamps (which are mandatorily installed in pairs), reducing the <b>conspicuity</b> of the stop lamps' message when the rear fogs are activated. To provide some safeguard against rear fog lamps being confused with stop lamps, UN Regulation 48 requires a separation of at least 10cm between the closest illuminated edges of any stop lamp and any rear fog lamp.|$|E
30|$|Many {{attention}} {{models are}} based on the biologically inspired architecture proposed by Koch and Ullman [30], which is motivated from Treisman and Gelade’s feature integration theory (FIT) [31]. This structure explains the human visual search strategies, i.e., the visual input is firstly divided into several feature types (e.g., intensity, color, or orientation) which are explored concurrently, and then the <b>conspicuities</b> of the features are combined into a saliency or master map which is a scalar, two-dimensional map providing higher intensities for the most prominent areas.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{an image}} quality metric is {{proposed}} by modeling the visual Horizontal Effect (HE) and saliency prop-erty over structural distortions. Specifically, Structrue SIMilarity (SSIM) is firstly performed {{to obtain the}} structural distortion map. Subsequently, the obtained distortion map is refined by the visual HE model, which depicts visual sensitivities of oriented stimuli over different oriented contents. Finally, in order to describe the local Human Visual System (HVS) <b>conspicuities,</b> a saliency pooling strategy is proposed to generate the resulting image quality index. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms SSIM and Visual Information Fidelity (VIF), which indicates that the obtained similarity index is more consistent with the perceptual evaluation of image quality.

This paper introduces the " 4 C-model", developed to address competencies of organizations, involved in Virtual organizations Breeding Environments (VBEs), from a new perspective. Design of the 4 C-model aims at modeling those characteristics of organizations’ competencies that {{are directly related to}} the criteria demanded in collaborative opportunities. As such, the 4 C-model directly promotes these organizations for invitation / involvement in potential Virtual Organizations (VOs). The main components in the 4 C-model include: Capabilities, Capacities, Costs, and <b>Conspicuities,</b> that constitute the 4 C in this model. The paper further illustrates the applicability / validity of this approach to the context of VO creation. The introduced approach for competency-based creation of VOs in this paper also benefits from the introduction of other related concepts, namely "aggregate competency" and "collective competency"...|$|R

Frog leg views are to be avoided, as they may cause severe pain and further {{displace}} the fracture.

If an MRI is not available or the patient can not be placed into the scanner a CT {{may be used as}} a substitute. MRI sensitivity for radiographically occult fracture is greater than CT. Bone scan is another useful alternative however substantial drawbacks include decreased sensitivity, early false negative results, and decreased <b>conspicuity</b> of findings due to age related metabolic changes in the elderly.|$|E
25|$|Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) {{are being}} used with {{increasing}} frequency in automotive lamps. They offer very long service life, extreme vibration resistance, and can permit considerably shallower packaging compared to most bulb-type assemblies. LEDs also offer a potential safety benefit when employed in stop lights, because when power is applied they rise to full intensity approximately 250 milliseconds (¼ second) faster than incandescent bulbs. This fast rise time not only improves the intentional <b>conspicuity</b> of the stop lamp, but could also provide following drivers with increased time {{to react to the}} appearance of the stop lamps. However, this faster rise time has not been shown to make cars with LED stop lamps less likely to be struck from behind.|$|E
25|$|<b>Conspicuity</b> for {{the rear}} of a vehicle is {{provided}} by rear position lamps (also called tail lamps or tail lights). These are required to produce only red light and to be wired such that they are lit whenever the front position lamps are lit, including when the headlamps are on. Rear position lamps may be combined with the vehicle's stop lamps or separate from them. In combined-function installations, the lamps produce brighter red light for the stop lamp function and dimmer red light for the rear position lamp function. Regulations worldwide stipulate minimum intensity ratios between the bright (stop) and dim (rear position) modes, so that a vehicle displaying rear position lamps will not be mistakenly interpreted as showing stop lamps, and vice versa.|$|E

25|$|Seemingly {{working against}} efforts of mimicry, P. alternata often {{construct}} nests in clusters, which potentially attract attention due to size. Clusters {{are defined as}} the aggregation of a multitude of nests consisting of different colonies. Two majors reasons for clustering include reduced predation due to the dilution effect and improved hunting. Clustering can increase overall fitness of the colony because cooperation results {{in an increase in}} finding food. The dilution effect assumes that by aggregating in a larger group, the chances of predator attack are significantly reduced. In addition, the theory proposes that individuals will seek center positions in the group to further reduce their chances of attack. There is evidence that the core clusters of P. alternata nests often have greater visits from conspecifics and consequently greater defense. The central core comprises older nests surrounded by younger colonies. The more densely packed clusters attract more predation due to a decrease in <b>conspicuity</b> but the predation rate is lower. It is assumed that the advantages of passive protection from predation served as a major evolutionary factor that resulted in nest clusters in P. alternata.|$|E

40|$|LVMEN IN TENEBRAE (Light in the darkness) {{presents}} a {{comparative study of}} images on ceramic oil lamps from three military camps, Nijmegen Kops Plateau, Velsen 1 and Haltern (Germany), located in the Lower Rhine Area, on the frontier of the Roman Empire. This thesis starts with descriptions of the manufacture, distribution and main uses of picture lamps for the specific period of 20 BC until AD 70, when Nijmegen Kops Plateau functioned as a Roman military settlement. The discussion proceeds with the main topic, picture lamp motifs, and introduces the classification system of Hella Eckardt, the base method used for the cross-site comparison of motifs in this thesis. The central question {{of this research is}} what motifs on picture lamps can tell us about aspects of Roman military life in the northern Rhine region. From their analysis it has been found that soldiers in those days believed in a supernatural world, evidenced by the depiction of several deities and cupids. Also myths and legends illustrated the picture lamps’ discs. Furthermore, aspects of daily life were visible, as were animals and plants. A special subject was the gladiator, as well as the chariot race, showing strength and cunning, important characteristics for a soldier. Last but not least, also many erotic scenes were spotted on the lamps from some Roman sites. In spite of the presence of a central Roman authority, no uniform standard image file can be discerned. A visible heterogeneity exists, determined by consumer’s choice or by the selection of pottery or traders, a simple matter of supply and demand. The picture lamps from Nijmegen Kops Plateau, Velsen 1 and Haltern are by no means the same. Each site has its own collection of motifs without a specific motif dominating. Only Velsen 1 can be seen as an exception for its great number of erotic scenes. Finally, some equivalents are highlighted of Roman picture lamp motifs in other artistic media across the Empire. It has been demonstrated that comparing the three sites at the northern border of the Lower Rhine area with other sites in the Roman Empire does not provide any distinctive patterns. No site is characterized by specific <b>conspicuities.</b> Also, no site has the same range of subjects. With some caution it can be noted that a number of fragments from the sites of Nijmegen Kops Plateau, Velsen 1 and Haltern yielded striking images, worn in a certain way and showing a nearly complete picture. Perhaps these shards can be considered as amulets, a function they received when the owner of the formerly complete lamp found the image too valuable to discard. From a number of fragments found at the Port of Velsen 1 it can be determined that the image formed part of the same erotic scene. Perhaps this may signify a ritual deposition, wherein the offeror begs for fertility...|$|R
6000|$|No, {{the pinch}} for his {{conscience}} {{after a few}} weeks had passed was simply an acute mistrust of the superficiality of performance into which the desire to justify himself might hurry him. That desire was passionate as regards Julia Dallow; it was ardent also as regards his mother; and, to make it absolutely uncomfortable, it was complicated with the conviction that neither of them would know his justification even when she should see it. They probably couldn't know it if they would, and very certainly wouldn't if they could. He assured himself, however, that this limitation wouldn't matter; it was their affair--his own was simply to have the right sort of thing to show. The work he was now attempting wasn't the right sort of thing, though doubtless Julia, for instance, would dislike it almost as much as if it were. The two portraits of Miriam, after the first exhilaration of his finding himself at large, filled him with no private glee; they were not in the direction in which he wished for the present really to move. There were moments when he felt almost angry, though of course he held his tongue, when by the few persons who saw them they were pronounced wonderfully clever. That they were wonderfully clever was just the detestable thing in them, so active had that cleverness been in making them seem better than they were. There were people to whom he would have been ashamed to show them, and these were the people whom it would give him most pleasure some day to please. Not only had he many an hour of disgust at his actual work, but he thought he saw as in an ugly revelation that nature had cursed him with an odious facility and that the lesson of his life, the sternest and wholesomest, would be to keep out of the trap it had laid for him. He had fallen into this trap on the threshold and had only scrambled out with his honour. He had a talent for appearance, and that was the fatal thing; he had a damnable suppleness and a gift of immediate response, a readiness to oblige, that made him seem to take up causes which he really left lying, enabled him to learn enough about them in an hour to have all the air of having converted them to his use. Many people used them--that was the only thing to be said--who had taken them in much less. He was at all events too clever by half, since this pernicious overflow had wrecked most of his attempts. He had assumed a virtue and enjoyed assuming it, and the assumption had cheated his father and his mother and his affianced wife and his rich benefactor and the candid burgesses of Harsh and the cynical reporters of the newspapers. His enthusiasms had been but young curiosity, his speeches had been young agility, his professions and adhesions had been like postage-stamps without glue: the head was all right, but they wouldn't stick. He stood ready now to wring the neck of the irrepressible vice that certainly would tend to nothing so much as to get him into further trouble. His only real justification would be to turn patience--his own of course--inside out; yet if there should be a way to misread that recipe his humbugging genius could be trusted infallibly to discover it. Cheap and easy results would dangle before him, little amateurish <b>conspicuities</b> at exhibitions helped by his history; putting it in his power to triumph with a quick [...] "What do you say to that?" [...] over those he had wounded. The fear of this danger was corrosive; it poisoned even lawful joys. If he should have a striking picture at the Academy next year it wouldn't be a crime; yet he couldn't help suspecting any conditions that would enable him to be striking so soon. In this way he felt quite enough how Gabriel Nash had [...] "had" [...] him whenever railing at his fever for proof, and how inferior as a productive force the desire to win over the ill-disposed might be to the principle of quiet growth.

Perhaps these represented five different friends who had asked her--all women, just as perhaps now Mary and Cissy, or one or other of them, were wiring by deputy. Sometimes she put in too much--too much of her own sense; sometimes she put in too little; and in either case this often came round to her afterwards, for she had an extraordinary way of keeping clues. When she noticed she noticed; that was what it came to. There were days and days, there were weeks sometimes, of vacancy. This arose often from Mr. Buckton's devilish and successful subterfuges for keeping her at the sounder whenever it looked as if anything might arouse; the sounder, which it was equally his business to mind, being the innermost cell of captivity, a cage within the cage, fenced oft from the rest by a frame of ground glass.

The most she would ever do would be always to shove off on him whenever she could the registration of letters, a job she happened particularly to loathe.

60|$|The day, as it developed, {{was large}} and hot, an unstinted splendour of summer; excursions, exercise, {{organised}} amusement were things admirably spared us; life became a mere arrested ramble or stimulated lounge, and we profited to the full by the noble freedom of Newmarch, that overarching ease which in nothing was so marked as in the tolerance of talk. The air of the place itself, in such conditions, left one's powers {{with a sense of}} play; if one wanted something to play at one simply played at being there. I did this myself, with the aid, in especial, of two or three solitary strolls, unaccompanied dips, of half an hour a-piece, into outlying parts {{of the house and the}} grounds. I must add that while I resorted to such measures not to see I only fixed what I had seen, what I did see, the more in my mind.

A second was that Mrs. Server then occupied a place as remote as possible from this couple, but not from Guy Brissenden, who had found means to seat himself next her while my notice was engaged by the others. What I was at the same time supremely struck with could doubtless only be Mrs. Server's bright ubiquity, as it had at last come to seem to me, and that of the companions she had recruited for the occasion. Attended constantly by a different gentleman, she was in the range of my vision wherever I turned--she kept repeating her picture in settings separated by such intervals that I wondered at the celerity with which she proceeded from spot to spot. She was never discernibly out of breath, though the associate of her ecstasy at the given moment might have been taken as being; and I kept getting afresh the impression which, the day before, had so promptly followed my arrival, the odd impression, as of something the matter with each party, that I had gathered, in the grounds, from the sight of her advance upon me with Obert. I had by this time of course made out--and it was absurd to shut my eyes to it--what that particular something, at least, was. It was that Obert had quickly perceived something to be the matter with her, and that she, on her side, had become aware of his discovery.|$|E

50|$|<b>Conspicuity</b> {{refers to}} an object's ability to catch a person's attention. When {{something}} is conspicuous it is easily visible. There are two factors which determine conspicuity: sensory <b>conspicuity</b> and cognitive <b>conspicuity.</b> Sensory <b>conspicuity</b> factors are the physical properties an object has. If an item has bright colors, flashing lights, high contrast with environment, or other attention-grabbing physical properties it can attract a person's attention much easier. For example, people tend to notice objects that are bright colors or crazy patterns before they notice other objects. Cognitive <b>conspicuity</b> factors pertain to objects that are familiar to someone. People tend to notice objects faster if they have some meaning to their lives. For example, when a person hears his/her name, their attention is drawn {{to the person who}} said it. The cocktail party effect describes the cognitive <b>conspicuity</b> factor as well. When an object isn't conspicuous, it is easier to be inattentionally blind to it. People tend to notice items if they capture their attention in some way. If the object isn't visually prominent or relevant, there is a higher chance that a person will miss it.|$|E
