50|$|To {{continue}} {{the black market}} cycle, that $100 greenback would find its way to high-level Vietnamese government officials, especially the corrupt ones, who could travel out of country, where the U.S. currency could be deposited safely (Bangkok, Taipei, or Hong Kong). Rumors also suggested that this hard currency (US dollars), would find its way to North Vietnamese European exchange accounts. Thirteen series of MPC were issued between 1946 and 1973, with varied designs often compared to Monopoly money due to their colors. After the official end of U.S. participation in the Vietnam War in early 1973, {{the only place where}} MPC remained in use was South Korea. In autumn of 1973, a surprise <b>conversion</b> <b>day</b> was held there, retiring MPC and substituting greenbacks. MPC was never again issued, and the concept lay dormant until the late 1990s, when it was revived somewhat {{in the form of the}} Eagle Cash stored value card system, used by U.S. armed forces in Iraq.|$|E
5000|$|To reduce profiteering from {{currency}} arbitrage, the U.S. military {{devised the}} MPC program. MPCs were paper money denominated in amounts of 5 cents, 10 cents, 25 cents, 50 cents, 1 dollar, 5 dollars, 10 dollars, and starting in 1968 20 dollars. Unlike US currency, these certificates were issued {{under the authority}} of the Department of War (later Department of Defense) rather than the Department of the Treasury. Consequently they do not bear the US Treasury seal found on virtually every example of US currency. MPCs were fully convertible to U.S. dollars upon leaving a designated MPC zone, and convertible to local currencies when going on leave (but not vice versa). Because they were and are not obligations of the US Treasury, they are (unlike all US currency) no longer redeemable. It was illegal for unauthorized personnel to possess MPC, and that policy, in theory, eliminated U.S. dollars from local economies. Although actual greenbacks were not circulating, many local merchants accepted MPC on par with US dollars, since they could use them on the black market. This was especially evident during the Vietnam War when the MPC program was at its zenith. To prevent MPC from being used as a primary currency in the host country and destroying the local currency value and economy, MPC banknote styles were frequently changed to deter black marketers and reduce hoarding, as the old style would become worthless. Many veterans can recount a <b>conversion</b> <b>day</b> or C-Day.|$|E
40|$|Childhood {{nephrotic}} syndrome is a chronic disease harmful to growth of children. Scientific and accurate prediction of negative <b>conversion</b> <b>days</b> {{for children with}} {{nephrotic syndrome}} offers potential benefits for treatment of patients and helps achieve better cure effect. In this study, the improved backpropagation neural network with momentum is used for prediction. Momentum speeds up convergence and maintains the generalization performance of the neural network, and therefore overcomes weaknesses of the standard backpropagation algorithm. The three-tier network structure is constructed. Eight indicators including age, lgG, lgA and lgM, etc. are selected for network inputs. The scientific computing software of MATLAB and its neural network tools are used to create model and predict. The training sample of twenty-eight cases is used to train the neural network. The test sample of six typical cases belonging to six different age groups respectively is {{used to test the}} predictive model. The low mean absolute error of predictive results is achieved at 0. 83. The experimental results of the small-size sample show that the proposed approach is to some degree applicable for the prediction of negative <b>conversion</b> <b>days</b> of childhood nephrotic syndrome...|$|R
