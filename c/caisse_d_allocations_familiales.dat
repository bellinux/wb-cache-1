If the family has three or more children it is not eligible for APL, but receives <b>allocation</b> <b>familiales</b> (family allowance), the amount of which depends on both the revenue of the household and the number of children, but it is not linear (the difference in the allocation between three and four children is higher than that between five and six, for example).

50|$|As {{in every}} country, some areas {{have a very}} high {{unemployment}} rate. As the social security, unemployment and other welfare system benefits are not indefinite, and are predicated upon having had a job at one point, families with no paid income do not benefit from the usually generous French social security system. In addition, the amount and duration are based on length of employment and the specific employment contract, further disadvantaging the unskilled immigrants in the banlieues. Welfare benefits include housing benefits and <b>allocations</b> <b>familiales</b> (welfare benefits for children). The sum that is paid to a non-working family is similar to that which one would receive working at a minimum wage part-time job. In France, there is a minimum salary called the SMIC: salaire minimum interprofessionnel de croissance. This is the minimal interprofessional wage which follows the economic growth of the country http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/particuliers/F2300.xhtml). It is illegal to hire someone for less than it. In 2005, the SMIC was 8.86 EUR per hour, 1,217.88 EUR per month for a full-time job. However, even the wage of a full-time unqualified job is often insufficient for the lifestyles of many people.|$|R

The sub-populations were selected before the response to the call for research projects by the French Family Allowance Fund (Caisse nationale des <b>allocations</b> <b>familiales</b> - CNAF), which funded these interviews. The original intention was to re-interview some of the individuals with successful educational pathways as well as children of immigrants who occupy an elite position in order to study the mechanisms of success. The qualitative section of the project submitted to the CNAF (entitled “Number of siblings and educational and socio-occupational destinies of the children of immigrants”) examines (i) the pathways of these successful individuals and (ii) also highlights the pathways of unsuccessful individuals (other siblings who did not attain the same educational level as the respondents) by focusing on the influence of family dynamics, specifically those between siblings. The children of immigrants (born or socialised in France) who were re-interviewed were {{selected on the basis of}} the geographical origin of their parents (Maghreb, sub-Saharan Africa or Turkey), their social class (working class), their educational level (at least two years of higher education) and their age (25 – 40). The rationale for the last criterion was to analyse completed educational pathways that took place in a comparable educational environment. The biographical interviews reveal changes in family involvement over time and provide more detail than the fairly basic indicators in the statistical survey.|$|R

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{based on}} German and French micro data {{shows that the}} redistributive effects of family support provided {{in the form of}} tax relief are stronger in Germany than in France. This is true both for redistribution between households of different sizes and for redistribution between households with different incomes. The average burden on single individuals without children compared to other types of household is larger in Germany than in France. Couples with one, two, or three children bear a comparatively lower burden in Germany than in France. For couples with four or more children, the relative income-tax burden is the same in the two countries. Overall, all German households with children bear a below-average share of the income-tax burden, while in France this applies only to lone parents and to couples with three or more children. In France, therefore, there is a greater degree of redistribution than in Germany from households consisting of couples with one or two children to households that have three or more children. The study also revealed differences in the redistributive effects related to the amount of household income. In all households with children, the burden is much lower (or the relief obtained is much higher) in the bottom five deciles in Germany than in France. Only couples with children who are in the top two deciles (or in the top three deciles in the case of couples with three children) enjoy greater relief under the French system than their counterparts in Germany. For a long time, family policy has been more of a peripheral question in the political debate in Germany, but issues relating to family policy have recently been gaining increasing priority. One important reason is the fact that family policy in Germany - despite the substantial amount of public funds spent on it compared to other countries - performs less well with respect to a range of indicators than the family policy of other European countries. Indicators that deserve particular mention in this respect are the low birthrate and the low share of working mothers. Contributors to the public debate often cite France, whose income-tax system and supply of state-funded child-care facilities are believed to be particularly supportive of families. France is seen {{as an example of a}} country with a 'successful family policy' because both its fertility rate and the share of working mothers in its labor force are higher than in Germany and, in particular, because childlessness is less common there amongst highly qualified women than in Germany. 4 French family policy differs from German family policy in many respects, ranging from the supply of subsidized child-care facilities and the design of the regulations on parental leave benefits to the family policy components of the income-tax system. 5 The focal point of this report is a comparison between the redistributive effects engendered in Germany and France by the different tax treatment of families with children. The German instruments concerned are child benefits (Kindergeld) and the tax-free allowance for dependent children (Kinderfreibetrag); the French measures are the 'family splitting' procedure in the calculation of income tax and family allowances (<b>Allocations</b> <b>Familiales).</b> If a comparison of the relief provided by these measures is to yield useful information, then it must, on principle, also take account of the empirical income distribution and of the different definitions of taxable income. This is particularly important in the context of a Franco-German comparison because there are some substantial differences in the definitions of taxable income used in the two countries. Having compared the tax treatment of families in France and Germany, the results of the empirical analysis of the effective average tax burden or amount of tax relief will then be presented; the analysis is based on the year 2001 because more recent data are not yet available for France. ...|$|R

Cell proteins miiay show various kinds of behavior. Some of them are constantly being renewed, either secreted, like digestive enzymes or serum albumin from the liver, or subjected to a molecular turnover, {{as in the case of}} muscle aldolase and probably all the water-extractable muscle proteins. The other pro-teins apparently stay unchanged during the life span of the cell, as in the case of hemoglobin in red blood cells (3), of collagen in the rat (4), or of myosin in the myofibril, a subcellular unit (5. 6). We have previously shown in the rat that myosin has a very slow renewal and that its meta-bolic behavior permits the measurement of the life span of the myofibril, which is close to 30 days in the rat. If, after the injection of a radioactive amino acid, the radioactivity of the protein is plotted against time, the first kind of protein shows an exponential decline, but hemoglobin and m-vo-sin show a plateau followed by a rapid decline. These two kinds of curves are combined if the protein is slowly renewed and belongs to a cell or part of a cell with a relatively short life span. In this work we have compared the metabolism of myosin and water-extractable muscle proteins in dystrophic mice, in their normal litter mates, and in another normal strain of mice.

It {{has been}} widely used in exploring {{a wide variety of}} economic issues including business-cycle fluctuations, monetary and fiscal policy, trade related phenomena, and regularities in asset price co-movements. This is the equilibrium associated with dynamic programs that represent the decision problem when agents must distinguish between aggregate and individual state variables. These state variables embody the prior and current information of the economy. The decisions and the realizations of exogenous uncertainty determine the values of the state variables in the next sequential time period. Hence the problem is recursive. A RCE is characterized by time invariant functions of a limited number of 'state variables', which summarize the effects of past decisions and current information. These functions (decision rules) include (a) a pricing function, (b) a value function, (c) a period allocation policy specifying the individual's decision, (<b>d)</b> period <b>allocation</b> policy specifying the decision of each firm and (e) a function specifying the law of motion of the capital stock.

40|$|For {{the problem}} of allocating one or more items {{among a group of}} {{competing}} agents, the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism is strategy-proof and efficient. However, the VCG mechanism is not strongly budget balanced: in gen- eral, value flows out of the system of agents in the form of VCG payments, which reduces the agents' utilities. In many settings, the objective is to maximize the sum of the agents' utilities (taking payments into account). For this purpose, several VCG redistribution mechanisms have been proposed that redistribute a large fraction of the VCG payments back to the agents, in a way that maintains strategy-proofness and the non-deficit property. Unfortunately, sometimes even the best VCG redistribution mechanism fails to redistribute a substantial fraction of the VCG payments. This results in a low total utility for the agents, even though the items are allocated efficiently. In this paper, we study strategy- proof allocation mechanisms that do not always allocate the items efficiently. It turns out that by allocating inefficiently, more payment can sometimes be redistributed, so that the net effect is an increase in the sum of the agents' utilities. Our objective is to design mechanisms that are competi- tive with the omnipotent perfect allocation in terms of the agents' total utility. We define linear allocation mechanisms. We propose an optimization model for simultaneously find- <b>ing</b> an <b>allocation</b> mechanism and a payment redistribution rule which together are optimal, given that the allocation mechanism is required to be either one of, or a mixture of, a finite set of specified linear allocation mechanisms. Fi- nally, we propose several specific (linear) mechanisms that are based on burning items, excluding agents, and (most generally) partitioning the items and agents into groups. We show or conjecture that these mechanisms are optimal among various classes of mechanisms. Mingyu Guo, Vincent Conitze...|$|R

At the same time the role of long-term debt, especially when it is heavily subsidized, is being rethought because so many development banks are plagued with nonperforming loans and doubts about the selection criteria used in allocating funds. The authors explore empirical evidence about the structure of debt maturity in Ecuadorian firms. They discuss how it has been affected by government intervention in credit markets, and by financial liberalization. Using firm panel data, they investigate the determinants of access to long-term debt in Ecuador. Finally, they provide evidence about how the maturity structure of debt affects firms'performance, particularly productivity and capital accumulation. They find that: a) long-term debt is very unevenly distributed; b) large firms {{are more likely to have}} access to long term debt than small firms and are on average more profitable; c) conditional on size, operating profits do not increase probability of receiving long-term credit and may actually decrease it, suggesting that the mechanism used to allocate long-term resources in Ecuador may be flawed; <b>d)</b> the <b>allocation</b> problem was worse for directed credit, though there is evidence this problem was less severe after financial liberalization; e) there is a strong positive association between asset maturity and debt maturity, a matching of assets and liabilities; f) shorter-term loans are not conducive to greater productivity, while long-term loans may lead to improvements in productivity; and g) while long-term loans may positively affect the quality of capital accumulation, they do not have an impact on the amount of fixed investment.

Measures of weight gain, plasma corticosterone, behavior, and immune parameters were evaluated at 7, 28, and 70 <b>d</b> after housing <b>allocation.</b> Housing BALB/c mice at 10 /cage had negative effects on weight gain, corticosterone, behavior, and immune parameters. Housing C 57 BL/ 6 mice at 10 /cage did not affect immune function or weight gain, although behavior and corticosterone showed statistical trends implying a negative effect Differences associated with housing densities of 2 and 5 mice/cage were less robust for all variables measured. We conclude that housing female BALB/c mice at 10 mice/cage (that is, at twice the Guide-recommended density) affects their physiology. We also conclude that mice vary in their responses in the parameters measured. These observations support the conclusion that it will be extremely challenging to scientifically determine an optimal cage density standard that can be uniformly applied across all mouse strains...|$|R
40|$|La {{prescription}} d antipsychotiques atypiques (APA) est de plus en plus fréquente (plus d indications, tolérance correcte). Les effets indésirables de type syndrome métabolique sont connus, avec la publication de recommandations pour le suivi cardio-vasculaires des patients sous APA par l AFSSAPS en 2010. Nous avons voulu caractériser la collaboration entre médecins généralistes et psychiatres dans cette situation, évaluer le suivi de ces patients, la connaissance des recommandations, et enfin, élaborer des propositions. Nous avons envoyé un questionnaire aux médecins généralistes (MG) et aux psychiatres d exercice ambulatoire à Grenoble (Pages Jaunes électroniques). Nous avons reçu 76 réponses : 28 psychiatres et 46 MG (244 médecins contactés). Nous avons contacté la <b>caisse</b> régionale <b>d</b> assurance maladie (CRAM) de Lyon, qui nous a communiqué le nombre de prescriptions pour 4 APA le premier semestre 2011. Nos résultats confirment une collaboration non satisfaisante et en conséquence un suivi non optimal des patients. Les raisons invoquées sont : manque de temps, divergences d opinion Les solutions proposées sont souvent simples (téléphone, présentation à l installation, réunions pluridisciplinaires) et consistent en la mise en application de méthodes sous-exploitées. Il existe une différence majeure entre les résultats de nos questionnaires (prescriptions dites peu fréquentes d APA) et ceux de la CRAM (volume de prescriptions important), et une différence significative sur la connaissance des recommandations entre MG (41 %) et psychiatres (93 %). Dans chaque spécialité apparait le besoin de travailler ensemble et la reconnaissance d un apport mutuel. The prescription of atypical antipsychotics (AAP) {{is becoming}} a more and more common habit, given {{the extension of the}} indication and the tolerance of the molecules. The arisen of side effects under atypical antipsychotics, and specifically the appearance of a metabolic syndrome is widely admitted today, leading the AFSSAPS to publish recommendations for the follow up of patients treated by AAP. Our objective was to do an inventory on the team work between general practitioners (GP) and psychiatrists in this specific situation, as well as an evaluation of the supervision of the patients treated by AAP; the knowledge of the recommendation by the doctors of these two specialties and to elaborate propositions to improve the collaboration. In order to accomplish this task, we have done a questionnaire intended to general practitioners and psychiatrists who practice in ambulatory in Grenoble (Data collected via the Yellow Pages). We have received 76 answers among the 244 contacted doctors (28 from the psychiatrist and 46 from the general practitioners) based on which we have done statistical analyses. Besides, we have contacted the CRAM of Lyon, who have provided us with the requested information in term of numbers of prescriptions for 4 AAP for the first half-year / semester of 2011. The most relevant results of our study confirm that, most of the time, the collaboration isn t fully satisfactory between GPs and psychiatrists, which leads to a under-achievement medical supervision of the patients (even though it is well known by doctors that the metabolic side effect are very common). There is an important difference between the statements done by the GP in the questionnaire, who declare issuing fewer prescriptions than shown in the CRAM results. The solutions proposed are often simple and realistic, such as communication over the phone between GPs and psychiatrists, introducing ourselves at the time of settlement, multidisciplinary meetings all of these mentioned solutions are methods that already exist but which are currently not used to their full potential. There is a significant difference between GPs (41 %) and psychiatrists (93 %) about the knowledge of the recommendations of AFSSAPS. In this two specialties, a real need of working together appears, as well as an acknowledge of the contribution of each one, who just request to set up. The called reasons were: the lack of time, the difference of opinion. GRENOBLE 1 -BU Médecine pharm. (385162101) / SudocSudocFranceF...|$|R
40|$|In the {{previous}} issue of Critical Care, we {{read with interest}} the paper by Pittiruti and colleagues [1]. Th e work presents innovative approaches {{to the problem of}} venous access in intensive care, but characteristics of the study need to be discussed in order to correctly address the decision-making process {{at the base of the}} use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs). Th e study population consisted of adult and pediatric patients in whom power injectable PICCs were used, but the authors did not clarify whether every patient admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) was automatically eligible for the placement of a PICC (a table summarizing population characteristics would help). To give important suggestions (for example, train <b>ing</b> and resource <b>allocation)</b> to those centers that are developing programs to improve the management of central venous catheters (CVCs), it would be interesting to know the total number of venous catheters inserted in the same period of the study. Pittiruti and colleagues reported a virtual absence of deep vein thrombosis but only of symptomatic throm-bosis. Ultrasound examination is performed only in the presence of clinical symptoms of suspected thrombosis. So the low incidence of symptomatic thrombosis is similar to that documented in a recent study from our group [2], and a higher asymptomatic thrombosis inci-dence documented by ultrasonography surveillance cannot be ruled out. Th e precise selection of the ratio of inner diameter of the vein to the outer diameter of the catheter could justify the good results obtained and should ensure the maintenance of a residual venous fl ow suitable to prevent pericatheter thrombosis. © 2010 BioMed Central Ltd Power injectable peripherally inserted central catheters in the ICU: not only a question of fl o...|$|R
