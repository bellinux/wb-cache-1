40|$|A two part user {{centered}} {{study of}} levels of automation for the <b>clearance</b> <b>amendment</b> process for advanced transport category aircraft was conducted. First, a survey on cockpit automation was distributed to pilots of Boeing 767 and Boeing 737 - 300 aircraft {{in order to}} obtain their evaluation of the current flight path management system, and their suggestions for improvements. A simulation of the Boeing 757 / 767 Electronic Flight Instrumentation System and Control Display Unit were also developed. This apparatus was used for {{the second part of the}} study, an experiment in which six qualified Boeing 757 / 767 pilots compared three modes of communication for the <b>clearance</b> <b>amendment</b> process: standard voice procedures, a textual delivery method and a graphical delivery method. The textual and graphical methods of delivery will be feasible in the near future with the development of the Mode S transponder. Overall, the graphical mode was found to be superior, both in terms of...|$|E
40|$|A {{desk-top}} {{simulation of}} a Boeing 757 / 767 Electronic Flight Instrumentation System (EFIS) and Control Display Unit (CDU) {{was used in}} an experiment to compare three modes of communication for the <b>clearance</b> <b>amendment</b> process: standard voice procedures, a textual delivery method, and a graphical delivery method. Eight qualified Boeing 757 / 767 pilots served as subjects. Each flew nine landing scenarios with three amendments given in each scenario. Both acceptable and unacceptable clearance amendments were presented {{in order to assess}} situational awareness. Times for comprehension and execution of the amendment were recorded along with workload ratings, responses to unacceptable amendments, and subjective impressions. The graphical mode was found to be superior in terms of the time measures and subjective ratings. No difference was found between the modes in the ability to detect unacceptable clearances...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{to study how}} automation, when {{used in conjunction with}} datalink for the delivery of air traffic control (ATC) clearance amendments, affects the situational awareness of aircrews was conducted. The study was focused on the relationship of situational awareness to automated Flight Management System (FMS) programming and the readback of ATC clearances. Situational awareness was tested by issuing nominally unacceptable ATC clearances and measuring whether the error was detected by the subject pilots. The experiment also varied the mode of clearance delivery: Verbal, Textual, and Graphical. The error detection performance and pilot preference results indicate that the automated programming of the FMS may be superior to manual programming. It is believed that automated FMS programming may relieve some of the cognitive load, allowing pilots to concentrate on the strategic implications of a <b>clearance</b> <b>amendment.</b> Also, readback appears to have value, but the small sample size precludes a definite conclusion. Furthermore, because textual and graphical modes of delivery offer different but complementary advantages for cognitive processing, a combination of these modes of delivery may be advantageous in a datalink presentation...|$|E

Aircraft with appropriate navigational equipment such as GPS, are also often cleared for a direct-to routing, where only the destination, or a few navigational waypoints are {{used to describe the}} route that the flight will follow. ATC will assign altitudes in its initial <b>clearance</b> or <b>amendments</b> thereto, and navigational charts indicate minimum safe altitudes for airways.|$|R
