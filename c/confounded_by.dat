5|$|Overfishing is {{a serious}} threat to {{seamount}} ecological welfare. There are several well-documented cases of fishery exploitation, for example the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand and the pelagic armorhead (Pseudopentaceros richardsoni) near Japan and Russia. The {{reason for this is that}} the fishes that are targeted over seamounts are typically long-lived, slow-growing, and slow-maturing. The problem is <b>confounded</b> <b>by</b> the dangers of trawling, which damages seamount surface communities, and the fact that many seamounts are located in international waters, making proper monitoring difficult. Bottom trawling in particular is extremely devastating to seamount ecology, and is responsible for as much as 95% of ecological damage to seamounts.|$|E
40|$|Background: Evidence on {{influenza}} vaccine effectiveness (VE) is commonly derived from observational studies. However, {{these studies are}} prone to <b>confounding</b> <b>by</b> indication and healthy vaccinee bias. We aimed to systematically investigate these two forms of confounding/bias. Methods: Systematic review of observational studies reporting influenza VE and indicators for bias and confounding. We assessed risk of <b>confounding</b> <b>by</b> indication and healthy vaccinee bias for each study and calculated ratios of odds ratios (crude/adjusted) to quantify the effect of confounder adjustment. VE-estimates during and outside influenza seasons were compared to assess residual <b>confounding</b> <b>by</b> healthy vaccinee effects. Results: We identified 23 studies reporting on 11 outcomes. Of these, 19 (83 %) showed high risk of bias: Fourteen due to <b>confounding</b> <b>by</b> indication, two for healthy vaccinee bias, and three studies showed both forms of confounding/bias. Adjustment for confounders increased VE on average by 12 % (95 % CI: 7 – 17 %; all-cause mortality), 9 % (95 % CI: 4 – 14 %; all-cause hospitalization) and 7 % (95 % CI: 4 – 10 %; influenza-like illness). Despite adjustment, nine studies showed residual <b>confounding</b> as indicated <b>by</b> significant off-season VE-estimates. These were observed for five outcomes, but more frequently for all-cause mortality as compared to other outcomes (p[*]=[*] 0. 03) and in studies which indicated healthy vaccinee bias at baseline (p[*]=[*] 0. 01). Conclusions: Both <b>confounding</b> <b>by</b> indication and healthy vaccinee bias are likely to operate simultaneously in observational studies on influenza VE. Although adjustment can correct for <b>confounding</b> <b>by</b> indication to some extent, the resulting estimates are still prone to healthy vaccinee bias, at least as long as unspecific outcomes like all-cause mortality are used. Therefore, cohort studies using administrative data bases with unspecific outcomes should no longer be {{used to measure the}} effects of influenza vaccination...|$|R

In this simulation study, we applied several control sampling approaches to control for <b>confounding</b> <b>by</b> various temporal patterns of an exposure variable and evaluated the usefulness of symmetric bidirectional control strategies. We simulated true relative risks (RRs; true ss = 0. 001) of deaths of 1. 051 per 50 -ppb increase of sulfur dioxide and included <b>confounding</b> <b>by</b> right- or left-skewed seasonal waves, linear long-term time trends, or a combination of both. The range of the estimated RRs from symmetric bidirectional control sampling approaches was 1. 044 approximately 1. 056 at either a long-term trend or any skewed seasonal wave of SO(2) levels, which indicated the bidirectional control sampling methods would successfully control <b>confounding</b> <b>by</b> design. The simulations with bidirectional sampling, however, show that biases may occur if waves are incomplete (20 - 43 % underestimated RRs). In conclusion, our simulations show that the symmetric bidirectional case-crossover design can substantially control for <b>confounding</b> <b>by</b> linear long-term trends and/or seasonality of an exposure variable by design as well. However, unidirectional control sampling would fail to control <b>confounding</b> <b>by</b> those variations of air pollution. Simulation results also show that even the bidirectional case-crossover design can be biased in a situation where the exposure variable shows incomplete cyclic waves, and therefore it cannot completely control for temporal confounding...|$|R

5|$|Fisheries {{operating}} off Portugal and Japan {{are responsible}} for most commercial landings of the kitefin shark, generally as bycatch in bottom trawls and on hook-and-line. Portugal reported a kitefin shark bycatch of 282 tons in 2000 and 119 tons in 2003. In {{other areas of the}} northeastern Atlantic this shark is rare and reported catches are likely <b>confounded</b> <b>by</b> misidentifications of other species; some are caught by mixed-species gillnet fisheries operating in deep water west of the British Isles, where surveys suggest that kitefin shark numbers may have declined by 94% since the 1970s. In the Mediterranean, this shark is caught incidentally by bottom trawl and gillnet fisheries. Although it is generally discarded alive, many are unable to return to deep water and do not survive. In the Southern Hemisphere, catches by the Australian South East Trawl Fishery are increasing following the relaxation of regulations regarding seafood mercury content; this species is not included under Australian fishery quotas. New Zealand kitefin shark catches peaked from 1986 to 1997. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the kitefin shark as Near Threatened worldwide, and as Vulnerable in the northeastern Atlantic in light of documented population declines.|$|E

After Trevor shows his credentials, Angela says she wants the target murdered, which Dwight protests is too extreme, so they compromise to breaking the target's kneecaps. Dwight realizes the target is Oscar when Angela angrily crushes a cookie given to her by Oscar. Dwight tries to get Angela to reconsider, but Trevor has already arrived to carry out the job. Dwight rushes to get Oscar out. They run into Trevor outside. A struggle between the three men ensues, with Oscar ultimately managing to take away Trevor's lead pipe. When Trevor runs away, Oscar and Dwight are confronted by Angela, who blames Oscar for turning her husband gay. Oscar says that he was always gay, and refuses to hand the lead pipe over to Angela.

40|$|The authors {{conducted}} a simulation study {{to evaluate whether}} exclusion of the early mortality (deaths occurring during a prespecified period immediately after baseline) reduces confounding of the exposure-mortality relation by preexisting disease. The simulation specified an exposure that decreased mortality risk {{in the absence of}} confounding and then introduced <b>confounding</b> <b>by</b> preexisting disease that biased the “true” protective effect of exposure towards greater risk. In 2, 000 cohorts, exclusion of the early mortality (deaths occurring during the first 25 months of a 60 -month follow-up period) did not alter the mean hazard ratio for exposure under conditions of <b>confounding</b> <b>by</b> preexisting disease that produced a constant, threefold increase in mortality risk during follow-up (the mean hazard ratio was 1. 72 for all subjects and 1. 72 after exclusion of the early mortality). However, when the authors specified <b>confounding</b> <b>by</b> preexisting disease which produced a threefold increase in mortality risk that attenuated over time, exclusion of the early mortality consistently identified the “true ” protective effect of exposure (the mean hazard ratio was 1. 07 for all subjects and 0. 31 after exclusion of the early mortality). Thus, under conditions of <b>confounding</b> <b>by</b> preexisting disease which produces an increase in mortality risk that attenuates over time—an effect that does have empirical support—the early mortality exclusion can be very effective in revealing the “true ” exposure-mortality relation.

Assessing the association of psychosocial assessment with risk of repeat self-harm is challenging due to the effects of <b>confounding</b> <b>by</b> indication. We analysed data from a cohort study of 15, 113 patients presenting to the emergency departments of three UK hospitals to investigate the association of psychosocial assessment with risk of repeat hospital presentation for self-harm. Time of day of hospital presentation was used as an instrument for psychosocial assessment, attempting to control for <b>confounding</b> <b>by</b> indication. Conventional regression analysis suggested psychosocial assessment was not associated with risk of repeat self-harm within 12 months (Risk Difference (RD) 0. 00 95 % confidence interval (95 %CI) - 0. 01 to 0. 02). In contrast, IV analysis suggested risk of repeat self-harm was reduced by 18 % (RD - 0. 18, 95 %CI - 0. 32 to - 0. 03) in those patients receiving a psychosocial assessment. However, the instrument of time of day did not remove all potential effects of <b>confounding</b> <b>by</b> indication, suggesting the IV effect estimate may be biased. We found that psychosocial assessments reduce risk of repeat self-harm. This is in-line with other non-randomised studies based on populations in which allocation to assessment was less subject to <b>confounding</b> <b>by</b> indication.
