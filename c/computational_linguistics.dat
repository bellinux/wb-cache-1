5|$|Some {{proponents of}} Saussure's view of {{language}} have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements {{and then by}} presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is Noam Chomsky, the originator of the generative theory of grammar, who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars. Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature {{of the human mind}} and to constitute the rudiments of what language is. By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used in formal logic, in formal theories of grammar, and in applied <b>computational</b> <b>linguistics.</b> In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as Alfred Tarski, Bertrand Russell, and other formal logicians.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recent workin {{the field}} of <b>computational</b> {{evolutionary}} <b>linguistics</b> suggests that the dynamics arising from the cultural evolution of language can explain the emergence of syntactic structure. We build on this workby introducing a model of language acquisition based on the Minimum Description Length Principle. Our experiments show that compositional syntax {{is most likely to}} occur under two conditions specific to hominids: (i) A complex meaning space structure, and (ii) the poverty of the stimulus. 1 Introduction: Language as a Complex Adaptive System To what degree can properties of human language be explained by examining the dynamics resulting from the cultural evolution of language?

The proposed system is based on a logical approach to <b>computational</b> corpus <b>linguistics</b> where sentences of logic are used to express statements about texts and logical inference is used to manipulate these sentences in order to analyse the texts. The thesis demonstrates the remarkable ease with which the functionali-ties needed in a corpus system can be implemented when based upon ade-quate means of representing, querying, and reasoning. The proposed system implements hand coding, searching, concordancing, parsing, counting, tabling, collocating, automatic part-of-speech tagging, lemma-tizing, excerpting, interpreting, treebanking, explanation, and various kinds of learning.
