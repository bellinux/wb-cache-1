50|$|Textiles have an {{assortment}} of uses, {{the most common of}} which are for clothing and for containers such as bags and baskets. In the household they are used in carpeting, upholstered furnishings, window shades, towels, <b>coverings</b> <b>for</b> <b>tables,</b> beds, and other flat surfaces, and in art. In the workplace they are used in industrial and scientific processes such as filtering. Miscellaneous uses include flags, backpacks, tents, nets, handkerchiefs, cleaning s, transportation devices such as balloons, kites, sails, and parachutes; textiles are also used to provide strengthening in composite materials such as fibreglass and industrial geotextiles. Textiles are used in many traditional crafts such as sewing, quilting and embroidery.|$|R
5000|$|In 1814 the Smiths {{moved back}} across the Connecticut River to Norwich, Vermont, where they {{suffered}} three seasons of crop failures, the last {{the result of the}} Year Without a Summer. The extended Smith clan had already moved west to New York, and in 1817, Joseph Smith, Sr. traveled alone to Palmyra, New York, followed shortly by the rest of his family—although not before Lucy Smith was forced to settle with some last-minute creditors. In Palmyra village, Smith, Sr. and his oldest sons hired themselves out as common laborers, ran a [...] "cake and beer shop," [...] and peddled refreshments from a cart; Lucy painted cloth <b>coverings</b> <b>for</b> <b>tables</b> and stands.|$|R
50|$|A napkin, serviette or face towelette is a {{rectangle}} of cloth {{used at the}} <b>table</b> <b>for</b> wiping the mouth and fingers while eating. It is usually small and folded, sometimes in intricate designs and shapes. The word comes from Middle English, borrowing the French nappe - a cloth <b>covering</b> <b>for</b> a <b>table</b> - and adding -kin, the diminutive suffix.|$|R
50|$|Penny rugs are not actual rugs for the floor, but {{decorative}} <b>coverings</b> <b>for</b> beds, <b>tables</b> and dressers and mantles.

40|$|The {{floors are}} carpeted, {{often with the}} high pile carpet locally termed ‘plush’. The {{furniture}} consists of thick foam-based seats covered in a fake velvet, arranged in sets of one or often two couches, plus armchairs often providing upholstered seating… The maroon of the upholstery may be picked up in curtains, carpets, <b>coverings</b> <b>for</b> <b>tables,</b> artificial flowers such as roses and countless other decorations, amounting to a general ‘any colour as long as it’s maroon’ principle, or its equivalent in gold/brown arrays. Artificial flowers are extremely common, often set into elaborate arrangements with perhaps half a dozen examples within the living room. There is a buffet which is a glass-fronted cabinet filled with china and glassware. It may also have internal lining of white or maroon plush. Wall decorations will be dominated by a machine-made tapestry with a religious theme, such as the Last Supper … prints of oil paintings with gilt surrounds… Prints with a West Indian theme would very rarely {{be found in the}} normative living room.

5000|$|In many European {{cultures}} a white, or mainly white, tablecloth {{used to be}} {{the standard}} <b>covering</b> <b>for</b> a dinner <b>table.</b> In the later medieval period spreading a high quality white linen or cotton cloth was an important part of preparing for a feast in a wealthy household. Over time the custom of arranging tableware on a cloth became common for most social classes except the very poorest. As eating habits changed in the 20th century, a much greater range of table-setting styles developed. Some formal dinners still use white tablecloths, often with a damask weave, but other colours and patterns are possible.|$|R
40|$|Lower {{and upper}} bounds {{on the size}} of a {{covering}} of subspaces in the Grassmann graph _q(n,r) by subspaces from the Grassmann graph _q(n,k), k ≥ r, are discussed. The problem is of interest from four points of view: coding theory, combinatorial designs, q-analogs, and projective geometry. In particular we examine coverings based on lifted maximum rank distance codes, combined with spreads and a recursive construction. New constructions are given for q= 2 with r= 2 or r= 3. We discuss the density for some of these <b>coverings.</b> <b>Tables</b> <b>for</b> the best known <b>coverings,</b> <b>for</b> q= 2 and 5 ≤ n ≤ 10, are presented.

5000|$|The {{main source}} for {{the account of the}} {{construction}} of the Tabernacle is the biblical Book of Exodus, specifically Exodus 25-31 and 35-40.

The significant cost of linen derives {{not only from the}} difficulty of working with the thread, but also because the flax plant itself requires a great deal of attention. In addition flax thread is not elastic, and therefore it is difficult to weave without breaking threads. Thus linen is considerably more expensive to manufacture than cotton.|$|R
