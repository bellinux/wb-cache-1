5|$|The Beatles' last {{concert was}} at Candlestick Park, San Francisco, on 29 August 1966, but Evans {{continued}} {{to work for them}} in the studio, and to run errands. After recording Revolver in 1966, McCartney went by himself on holiday to France, but asked to meet Evans in Bordeaux, at the Grosse Horloge church (on the corner of cours Victor Hugo and rue St. James). At exactly the pre-arranged time of one o'clock, Evans was standing under the <b>church</b> <b>clock</b> when McCartney arrived. They then drove to Madrid together, but after feeling bored, McCartney phoned Epstein's office in London and asked to be booked on a safari holiday in Kenya. When they arrived they visited the Amboseli Reserve at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro, and also stayed at the exclusive Treetops Hotel, where the rooms are built on the branches of trees.|$|E
25|$|A <b>church</b> <b>clock</b> was {{installed}} in 1950. The belfry has a ring of eight bells that allows 5,030 changes to be rung.|$|E

In 1549 {{following}} the Dissolution of the chantries, monasteries and religious guilds, church plate was sold and land purchased for the town. Resulting rents were used to maintain Melton School, first recorded in 1347 {{and one of the}} oldest educational establishments in Britain. Funds were also used to maintain roads, bridges and to repair the <b>church</b> <b>clock.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{tower is}} of three stages. The lower stages might {{be part of}} an 11th-century {{previously}} unbuttressed tower, and contains at its west side an early 15th-century chamfered reveal window opening with pointed arch surrounded by a hood mould with label stops in human form. The inset Perpendicular window is of three lights of panel tracery below, and six above. The panels are headed with trefoils, the lower within ogee heads. A <b>church</b> <b>clock</b> is just below the belfry stage. Between the window and clock is a hooded slit window, a repeat slit window is on the north and south sides. The Belfry stage was added in the 13th century and is defined at its base by a string course with repeating dentils. Central to each side of the belfry stage is a chamfered window opening with a plain hood mould following a semi-circular head. Within the opening are louvered and pointed twin-lights, these separated by a central octagonal shaft with a trefoil opening above in the north and south windows. The roof line is defined by a further string course with repeated grotesque bosses, and pairs of gargoyle drains on each side. An embattled roof parapet with crocketed corner pinnacles sits above. The tower is partially clasped at the north and south by the church aisles, and on the north side by an ashlar three-stepped angled buttress against the lower stages.|$|E
500|$|The Rev. Robert Brickel, Rector of St. Michael's Church, Hoole from 1848–1881, {{raised money}} by public {{subscription}} in Lancashire, Oxford and Cambridge {{to fund the}} creation of a new chancel and sanctuary to the church to be named [...] "The Horrocks Chapel". The chancel was completed by 1824, and the sanctuary by 1858. The vestry was extended in 1998–1999, and the first window in the north wall, originally installed in 1872, has stained glass roundels commemorating the transits of Venus of 1874 and 2004. There is also a marble tablet commemorating Horrocks. The <b>church</b> <b>clock,</b> contributed by the parishioners as their commemoration of Horrocks, was installed in 1859; the sundial, installed in 1875, has a quotation from Horrocks ("Sine Sole Sileo") that translates as [...] "Without the sun I am silent".|$|E
500|$|The {{pastoral}} Epistles, too, {{give the}} impression of being in real places, with flesh-and-blood people, at specific times of day. Epistle 48 tells how the friends return to Stockholm by boat after a night out on Lake Mälaren, one summer morning in 1769. Each of its twenty-one verses paints a picture of a moment in the peaceful journey, from the wind stirring the fallen sails, the skipper's daughter coming out of her cabin, the cockerel crowing, the <b>church</b> <b>clock</b> striking four in the morning, the sun glimmering on the calm water. The effects may seem to be haphazard, but [...] "each stanza is a little picture, framed by its melody. We remember it all, seem to have lived through it, like a morning in our own lives." [...] Britten Austin calls it [...] "a new vision of the natural and urban scene. Fresh as Martin's. Detailed as Hogarth's. Frail and ethereal as Watteau's." ...|$|E

The memorial is repeated twice in the nave at the south of the tower arch, by a framed brass plaque and a printed and framed Roll of Honour.

On the second {{morning of the}} trial, after {{evidence}} had been taken for two hours (I heard the <b>church</b> <b>clocks</b> strike), happening to cast my eyes over my brother jurymen, I found an inexplicable difficulty in counting them. I counted them several times, yet always with the same difficulty. In short, I made them one too many.|$|R
