5|$|Asch was {{notable for}} a chance event. The 390th Squadron of the 366th Fighter Group had {{launched}} two fighter sweeps that morning, which played a <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in the failure of JG 11′s attack. The leader of the 487th squadron, 352nd Fighter Group, John Charles Meyer, anticipated German activity and had a flight of 12 P-51s about to take off on a combat patrol when the attack began. They took off under fire.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Arlington Line, which was built several miles to the southwest of Fort Jackson, atop the heights of Arlington, the maintenance of Forts Jackson and Runyon was neglected. The two forts had largely been made redundant by the newer, stronger works atop the hills, and it was believed that neither played a <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> any longer in the defenses of Washington. Fort Jackson was kept in service only as an inspection station for traffic crossing Long Bridge.|$|E

One source says that Hinde played a <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in negotiating early Indian treaties signed with the United States government, without defining his actions.|$|E
5|$|In an animal, {{cells are}} {{constantly}} dying. A balance between cell division and cell death keeps {{the number of}} cells relatively constant in adults. There are two different ways a cell can die: by necrosis or by apoptosis. In contrast to necrosis, which often results from disease or trauma, apoptosis—or programmed cell death—is a normal healthy function of cells. The body has to rid itself of millions of dead or dying cells every day, and phagocytes play a <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in this process.|$|E

5|$|Malaria parasites contain apicoplasts, organelles {{usually found}} in plants, {{complete}} {{with their own}} genomes. These apicoplasts {{are thought to have}} originated through the endosymbiosis of algae and play a <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in various aspects of parasite metabolism, such as fatty acid biosynthesis. Over 400 proteins {{have been found to be}} produced by apicoplasts and these are now being investigated as possible targets for novel anti-malarial drugs.|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} types and sizes of horse {{were used in}} war, depending on the form of warfare. The type used varied with whether the horse was being ridden or driven, and whether they were being used for reconnaissance, cavalry charges, raiding, communication, or supply. Throughout history, mules and donkeys as well as horses played a <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in providing support to armies in the field.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms {{can form}} an endosymbiotic {{relationship}} with other, larger organisms. For example, microbial symbiosis plays a <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in the immune system. The microorganisms {{that make up}} the gut flora in the gastrointestinal tract contribute to gut immunity, synthesize vitamins such as folic acid and biotin, and ferment complex indigestible carbohydrates. Some microorganisms that are seen to be beneficial to health are termed probiotics and are available as dietary supplements, or food additives.|$|E

According to The Guardian, Bardot's photographs in particular turned Saint-Tropez into the beachwear {{capital of the}} world, with Bardot identified as the original Cannes bathing beauty. Bardot's photography helped to enhance the public profile of the festival, and Cannes in turn played a <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in her career.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{far from}} land are tracked by weather satellites capturing visible and infrared images from space, usually at half-hour to quarter-hour intervals. As a storm approaches land, {{it can be}} observed by land-based Doppler weather radar.

5|$|Trucks {{came into}} {{widespread}} {{use in the}} Western World during World War I, and quickly gained reputation {{as a means of}} long distance transportation of goods. Modern highways, such as the Trans-Canada Highway, Highway 1 (Australia) and Pan-American Highway allowed transport of goods and services across great distances. Automobiles continue to play a <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in the economies of the Industrialized countries, resulting in rise of businesses such as motor freight operation and truck transportation.|$|E

5|$|While the {{long-term}} potentiation of synapses in cell culture seems {{to provide an}} elegant substrate for learning and memory, the contribution of LTP to behavioral learning — that is, learning {{at the level of}} the whole organism — cannot simply be extrapolated from in vitro studies. For this reason, considerable effort has been dedicated to establishing whether LTP is a requirement for learning and memory in living animals. Because of this, LTP also plays a <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in fear processing.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in the Clan {{is that of}} the deputy. When a new Clan {{leader is}} appointed, or the old deputy dies or retires, a new cat will be chosen to fulfill this role. The deputy of a Clan is {{generally}} in charge of less urgent, but still important duties, such as deciding which cats will go on a hunting patrol and which will check the borders. Although the Clan deputy still sleeps in the warriors den, they are respected by other members of the Clan. Often, a cat will come to the deputy first when asking for advice. When a Clan leader dies, the current deputy will take on the new role of leader, and receive their nine lives from StarClan.|$|E
5|$|As a Senator, Gravel became {{nationally known}} for his {{forceful}} but unsuccessful attempts to end the draft during the War in Vietnam and for putting the Pentagon Papers into the public record in 1971 at some risk to himself. He conducted an unusual campaign for the Democratic nomination in 1972 for Vice President of the United States, and then played a <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in getting Congressional approval for the Trans-Alaska pipeline in 1973. He was re-elected to the Senate in 1974, but gradually alienated most of his Alaskan constituencies and his bid for a third term was defeated in a primary election in 1980.|$|E

5|$|At the time, several princes {{complained that}} they were being betrayed by Britain, who they {{regarded}} as an ally, and Sir Conrad Corfield resigned his position as head of the Political Department in protest at Mountbatten's policies. Mountbatten's policies were also criticised by the opposition Conservative Party. Winston Churchill compared the language used by the Indian government with that used by Adolf Hitler before the invasion of Austria. Modern historians such as Lumby and Moore, however, take the view that Mountbatten played a <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in ensuring that the princely states agreed to accede to India.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though it}} has been adopted {{recently}} in Albanian folklore (around the 18th century), the clarinet, or gërneta as it is called, {{is one of the}} most important instruments in Albania, especially in the central and southern areas. The clarinet plays a <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in saze (folk) ensembles that perform in weddings and other celebrations. It is worth mentioning that the kaba (an instrumental Albanian Isopolyphony included in UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage list) is characteristic of these ensembles. Prominent Albanian clarinet players include Selim Leskoviku, Gaqo Lena, Remzi Lela (Çobani), Laver Bariu (Ustai), and Nevruz Nure (Lulushi i Korçës).|$|E
5|$|From {{the sixteenth}} century onwards Alfred's {{reputation}} became dominant and Æthelstan largely disappeared from popular consciousness. Sharon Turner's History of the Anglo-Saxons, first published between 1799 and 1805, played a <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in promoting Anglo-Saxon studies, and he helped to establish Brunanburh as a key battle in English history, but his treatment of Æthelstan was slight in comparison with Alfred. Charles Dickens had only one paragraph on Æthelstan in his Child's History of England, and although Anglo-Saxon history was a popular subject for nineteenth-century artists, and Alfred was frequently depicted in paintings at the Royal Academy between 1769 and 1904, {{there was not one}} picture of Æthelstan.|$|E
