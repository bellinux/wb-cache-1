5|$|A new {{civil war}} broke out when Duke Béla claimed the crown for himself in 1059, but his three sons {{accepted}} the rule of Solomon, Andrew I's son, in 1063. Initially, the young king and his cousins cooperated; for instance, they jointly defeated the Pechenegs plundering Transylvania in 1068. The power <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> royal family caused a new civil war in 1071. It lasted up to Solomon's abdication in favor {{of one of his}} cousins, Ladislaus, in the early 1080s.|$|E

5|$|The {{end of the}} Platine War did {{not bring}} a halt to <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region. Peace {{remained}} out of reach in Uruguay, which remained unstable and {{in a state of}} constant crisis due to continuing internecine strife between the Blancos and Colorados. Border disputes, power struggles among diverse regional factions, and attempts to establish regional and internal influence would eventually spark the Uruguayan War as well as the later Paraguayan War.|$|E

5|$|After the Cold War, the <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle East {{triggered}} {{a crisis in}} 1990, when Iraq under Sadaam Hussein invaded and attempted to annex Kuwait, an ally of the United States. Fearing that the instability would spread to other regions, President George H.W.

5|$|Between {{the second}} and third Macedonian wars Rome faced further <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region due to a {{tapestry}} of shifting rivalries, alliances and leagues all seeking to gain greater influence. After the Macedonians had been defeated in the Second Macedonian War in 197 BC, the Greek city-state of Sparta stepped into the partial power vacuum in Greece. Fearing the Spartans would take increasing control of the region, the Romans drew on help from allies to prosecute the Roman-Spartan War, defeating a Spartan army at the Battle of Gythium in 195 BC. They also fought their former allies the Aetolian League in the Aetolian War, against the Istrians in the Istrian War, against the Illyrians in the Illyrian War, and against Achaia in the Achaean War.|$|E
5|$|By 1986, Angola {{began to}} assume a more {{central role in the}} Cold War, with the Soviet Union, Cuba and other Eastern bloc nations {{enhancing}} support for the MPLA government, and American conservatives beginning to elevate their support for Savimbi's UNITA. Savimbi developed close relations with influential American conservatives, who saw Savimbi as a key ally in the U.S. effort to oppose and rollback Soviet-backed, undemocratic governments around the world. The conflict quickly escalated, with both Washington and Moscow seeing it as a critical strategic <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cold War.|$|E

5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, the Caribbean Sea was {{initially}} an important theatre of naval conflict, as ships operating {{from the various}} French, British, Spanish and Dutch colonies preyed on enemy trade. During 1809 and 1810 however, the Royal Navy launched a series of co-ordinated amphibious operations that eliminated the French and Dutch colonies and brought the <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean to an end. With the threat of attacks on British trade in the region significantly reduced, the Royal Navy correspondingly reduced {{their presence in the}} Caribbean and the remaining British ships were distributed to observe trouble spots in the region, which in 1812 included the independent nation of Haiti.|$|E
5|$|Imperial troops mainly used Minié rifles, {{which were}} much more accurate, lethal, and had a much longer range than the smoothbore Gewehr guns, although, being also muzzle-loading, they were {{similarly}} limited to two shots per minute. Improved breech-loading mechanisms, such as the Snider, developing {{a rate of about}} ten shots a minute, are known to have been used by troops of the Chōshū Domain against the Shogunate's Shōgitai, at the Battle of Ueno in July 1868. In {{the second half of the}} <b>conflict,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northeast theater, Tosa Province troops are known to have used American-made Spencer repeating rifles. American-made handguns were also popular, such as the 1863 Smith & Wesson Army No 2, which was imported to Japan by the Scottish trader Thomas Blake Glover and used by the Satsuma forces.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 {{a militant}} named Gédéon Kyungu Mutanga {{broke out of}} prison.

The United Nations Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (known as MONUSCO under its French name) provided logistical and advisory assistance to local government officials, police, and the military. Many Katangese people hoped that the UN would, {{in light of their}} role in ending the original secession, help resolve the situation. Kyungu and many of his forces surrendered in October 2016 to seek a peaceful solution.|$|E

5|$|In Washington, Savimbi forged close {{relationships}} with influential conservatives, including Michael Johns (The Heritage Foundation's foreign policy analyst {{and a key}} Savimbi advocate), Grover Norquist (President of Americans for Tax Reform and a Savimbi economic advisor), and others, who played critical roles in elevating escalated U.S. covert aid to Savimbi's UNITA and visited with Savimbi in his Jamba, Angola headquarters to provide the Angolan rebel leader with military, political and other guidance in his war against the MPLA government. With enhanced U.S. support, the war quickly escalated, {{both in terms of}} the intensity of the conflict and also in its perception as a key <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> overall Cold War.|$|E
