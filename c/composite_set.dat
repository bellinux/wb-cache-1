Individuals capable of developing gifted behavior are those possessing or capable of developing this <b>composite</b> <b>set</b> of traits and applying them to any potentially valuable area of human performance.

To overcome the disadvantages of this method, such as a short working time, light-curing resin composites were introduced in the 1970’s. The first light-curing units used ultra-violet light to set the material, however this method had a limited curing depth and was a high risk to patients and clinicians. Therefore, UV light-curing units were later replaced by visible light-curing systems which used Camphorquinone as a light source and overcame the issues produced by the UV light-curing units.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{approach}} that looks for the most discriminating points in horizontal, vertical, velocity and pressure trajectories. Then based on these discriminating points, we have made two <b>composite</b> feature <b>sets</b> i. e. (horizontal, vertical) and (velocity, pressure). Out of these two <b>composite</b> feature <b>sets,</b> one will be declared as the most discriminating <b>composite</b> feature <b>set</b> during the training phase. Finally the verification based on the selected discriminating composite feature will be performed. We believe that every signer has some discriminating points that a forger cannot mimic with certain pressure and velocity whereas these points are maintained by the genuine signer. So the verification based on these discriminating points can lead us to a better performance of the verification system. For a reliable verification system, comparison between forgery and genuine signer should {{be made on the}} basis of discriminating points rather than using all the sample points of each trajectory in the verification which means that all the points are given equal weights and there is always a possibility that the non-discriminating points can overshadow the effect of discriminating points. Experimental results demonstrate superiority of our approach in On-line signature verification in comparison with other techniques. 1...|$|R

30|$|The {{modeling}} process {{discussed in}} this section is applicable to the higher resolution model in Fig. 1 a, which contains N degraded states for N critical faults. Splitting each of these states yields a discrete state-space formed from the direct product of a <b>composite</b> <b>set</b> of binary equipment states {faulty, degraded} and a <b>composite</b> <b>set</b> of binary relay states {restrain, operate}, respectively. Thus the 6 -state model in Fig. 2 b is expansible systematically to any desired resolution. Transition rates associated with failure and misoperation processes generally increase linearly with the system size in the aggregated model as dictated by the Poisson superposition property [24]. Thus the model {{in the form of}} Fig. 2 b is also scalable, and the monotonic dependence of availability on security indices remains true.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} problems with image processing of petrographic thin sections is that the appearance (colour I intensity) of a mineral grain will vary with {{the orientation of the}} crystal lattice to the preferred direction of the polarizing filters on a petrographic microscope. This makes it very difficult to determine grain boundaries, grain orientation and mineral species from a single captured image. To overcome this problem, the Rotating Polarizer Stage was used to replace the fixed polarizer and analyzer on a standard petrographic microscope. The Rotating Polarizer Stage rotates the polarizers while the thin section remains stationary, allowing for better data gathering possibilities. Instead of capturing a single image of a thin section, six <b>composite</b> data <b>sets</b> are created by rotating the polarizers through 900 (or 1800 if quartz c-axes measurements need to be taken) in both plane and cross polarized light. The <b>composite</b> data <b>sets</b> can be viewed as separate images and consist of the average intensity image, the maximum intensity image, the minimum intensity image, the maximum position image, the minimum position image and the gradient image. The overall strategy used by the image processing system is to gather the <b>composite</b> data <b>sets,</b> determine the grain boundaries using the gradient image, classify the different mineral species present using the minimum and maximum intensity images and then perform measurements of grain shape and, where possible, partial crystallographic orientation using the maximum intensity and maximum position images...|$|R
