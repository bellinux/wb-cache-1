In general, abutment design has been extensively analyzed [4], particularly for integral abutments. Barr et al. [5] investigated the spalling of an integral abutment bridge in Salt Lake City, UT, through monitoring and finite element modeling. Nikravan [6] studied the behavior of integral bridges subjected to temperature variations using 3 D finite element models. However, pier choices are generally limited to CIP concrete supported either by one hammerhead bent cap or more than one column and pile bent cap [7]. Some special types (straddle bent caps) are briefly addressed elsewhere [8]. Public agencies have guidelines on the design of the most common bent cap types, such as rectangular <b>column</b> <b>bent</b> caps [9, 10], inverted T <b>column</b> <b>bent</b> caps [9, 10] and hammerhead bent caps [11]. However, comparative design/construction guidance for alternates is lacking.|$|E

This paper presents the new approach to improve the seismic behavior of such bridges using Nitinol shape memory alloys (SMAs). Superelastic SMAs have the ability to remain elastic under very large deformation due to martensitic transformation. This unique property leads to enhanced performance of controlled bridge compared with the performance of the reference bridge. To evaluate the effectiveness of the devices, nonlinear time history analysis is performed on a RC single <b>column</b> <b>bent</b> highway bridge using a suite of representative ground motions.

40|$|To {{assess the}} losses {{associated}} with future earthquakes, seismic vulnerability functions {{are commonly used}} to correlate the damage or loss of a structure {{to the level of}} seismic intensity. A common procedure in seismic vulnerability assessment is to estimate the seismic fragility, which is defined as the conditional probability that a structure fails to meet the specific performance level for given level of seismic intensity. This dissertation proposes a methodology to estimate the fragility of corroded reinforced concrete (RC) bridges with two-column bents subject to seismic excitation. Seismic fragility functions are first developed for the RC bridges with two-column bents. All available information from science/engineering laws, numerical analysis, laboratory experiments, and field measurements has been used to construct the proper form of the fragility functions. The fragility functions are formulated, at the individual <b>column,</b> <b>bent,</b> and bridge levels, in terms of the spectral acceleration and the ratio between the peak ground velocity and the peak ground acceleration. The developed fragility functions properly account for the prevailing uncertainties in fragility estimation. The probabilistic capacity and demand models are then combined with the probabilistic models for chloride-induced corrosion and the time-dependent corrosion rate. The fragility estimates for corroded RC bridges incorporates the uncertainties in the parameters of capacity and demand models, and the inexactness (or model error) in modeling the material deterioration, structural capacity, and seismic demands. The proposed methodology is illustrated by developing the fragility functions for an example RC bridge with 11 two-column bents representing current construction in California. The developed fragility functions provide valuable information to allocate and spend available funds for the design, maintenance, and retrofitting of structures and networks. This study regarding the vulnerability of corroding RC bridges will be of direct value to those making decisions about the condition assessment, residual life, and the ability of lifeline structures to withstand future seismic demands...|$|E
30|$|The {{application}} of end eccentricities at column ends changed the strain distribution along the column cross-section at the mid-height point, where tensile strain maybe developed {{based on the}} end eccentricity value {{as well as the}} curvature mode. For <b>columns</b> <b>bent</b> in single curvature modes, tensile strain could be developed at the mid-height section since this section is the maximum stressed section for the case of equal end eccentricities. While, for unequal end eccentricities, the maximum stressed section could be shifted based on the end eccentricities combinations. On the other hand, for the <b>columns</b> <b>bent</b> in double curvature modes, the mid-height section could develop the lowest strain for the case of equal end eccentricities and higher values but not the maximum ones for the case of unequal end eccentricities.|$|R

These moments could be produced by gravity loads or the lateral loads. First, the current paper presents a detailed analysis on the overall structural behavior of 15 eccentrically loaded columns as well as one concentrically loaded control one. <b>Columns</b> <b>bent</b> in either single curvature or double curvature modes are tested experimentally up to failure under the effect of different end eccentricities combinations. Three end eccentricities ratio were studied, namely, 0.1 b, 0.3 b and 0.5 b, where b is the column width. Second, an expression correlated the decay in the normalized axial capacity of the column and the acting end eccentricities was developed based on the experimental results and then verified against the available formula. Third, based on the equivalent column concept, the equivalent pin-ended columns were obtained for <b>columns</b> <b>bent</b> in either single or double curvature modes. And then, the effect of end eccentricity ratio was correlated to the equivalent column length. Finally, a simplified design procedure was proposed for eccentrically loaded braced column by transferring it to an equivalent axially loaded pin-ended slender column. The results of the proposed design procedure showed comparable results against the results of the ACI 318 - 14 code.|$|R

30|$|It {{was found}} in general that shear keys have a {{predominant}} effect on the overall seismic response of the bridges studied herein. Shear keys are commonly used at the abutment as a fuse to provide resistance to lateral loads. Therefore, bridge <b>columns</b> and <b>bents</b> are designed to provide capacity to resist the full seismic demand assuming failure of shear keys. This study suggest that however, these assumptions may lead to an overly conservative design of the bridge <b>columns</b> and <b>bents,</b> {{as well as the}} provided design deformation capacities of the components particularly at the abutments. This study suggests that the failure of shear keys is followed by elevated transverse displacements and increased demand on columns. The ‘absence’ of shear keys may lead to increased abutment-soil structure interactions. In other words, gap opening is larger and increases with skew. It was also noted that the relative ‘effectiveness’ of shear keys in controlling the seismic response of bridges diminishes as the skew angle becomes larger. Skewed bridges that were modeled without the shear keys experienced larger gap openings at the acute corner that became smaller toward the obtuse corner. The observation was valid for all skew angles and for all aspect ratios as well. In addition, the gap openings were significantly smaller in bridges modeled with the shear key elements.|$|R

In addition to the reinforced edge beam, four large prestressing tendons were installed the length of the bridge along the underside of the deck slab.

40|$|This {{research}} study {{concentrates on the}} effects of geometric irregularities on the seismic response and fragility analysis of bridges. The experiences of past earthquakes have affirmed that bridges with geometric irregularities or inconsistencies in configuration have a higher probability of damage than the regular, straight bridges. Although previous studies have explored the fragility analysis of different types of bridges, {{there is a lack of}} research that focuses {{on the effects of}} various types of geometric irregularities on the development of fragility curves. The current work aims to address this deficiency by focusing on the impacts of (i) skew angle, (ii) unbalanced stiffness of frames, and (iii) tall <b>column</b> <b>bents</b> on the seismic performance of concrete box-girder bridges in California. This research first identifies the analytical modeling considerations associated with the design and construction of bridges in California. In the next step, bridge plans are extensively reviewed to determine the appropriate distribution of parameters needed to set up the various bridge components required for finite element modeling. Following the analytical modeling of bridges, a sensitivity analysis is performed on different bridge attributes to classify all of the categories of bridges existing in California. This classification helps keep the number of simulations and computational efforts within a reasonable range. The impacts of each type of irregularity on the probabilistic seismic demand model and the fragility of bridges are investigated in the later phases of this project. Finally, implementing statistical techniques, the results are compared to the responses of bridges with regular configurations. This results in the development of modification factors that allow the fragility curves of regular bridges to be modified, taking irregularities into account. Eventually, the proposed modification factors for each type of irregularity are tested and finalized. Ph. D...|$|R
