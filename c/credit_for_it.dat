5|$|Coolidge {{has often}} been criticized for his actions during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the worst natural {{disaster}} to hit the Gulf Coast until Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Although he did eventually name Secretary Hoover to a commission in charge of flood relief, scholars argue that Coolidge overall showed {{a lack of interest}} in federal flood control. Coolidge did not believe that personally visiting the region after the floods would accomplish anything, {{and that it would be}} seen as mere political grandstanding. He also did not want to incur the federal spending that flood control would require; he believed property owners should bear much of the cost. On the other hand, Congress wanted a bill that would place the federal government completely in charge of flood mitigation. When Congress passed a compromise measure in 1928, Coolidge declined to take <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> and signed the bill in private on May 15.|$|E

25|$|Political {{leaders who}} were {{convinced}} that women's suffrage was inevitable began to pressure local and national legislators to support it so their party could claim <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> in future elections.

25|$|Finally, in late 1931, Szent-Györgyi gave Svirbely, {{formerly}} of King's lab, {{the last of}} his adrenal-derived hexuronic acid with the suggestion that it might be the anti-scorbutic factor. By the spring of 1932, King's laboratory had proven this, but published the result without giving Szent-Györgyi <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> leading to a bitter dispute over priority claims (in reality it had taken a team effort by both groups, since Szent-Györgyi was unwilling to do the difficult and messy animal studies).|$|E
25|$|In the 2008–09 season, she {{executed}} the 3A-2T combination {{in international}} competition, first getting full <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> at the 2008–09 Grand Prix Final. At that same competition, Asada {{became the first}} female skater to land two 3A in the same program.

25|$|Speaking {{with the}} support of both the Egyptian and Italian officials, Abbas and Hassan began talking to the hijackers – giving the {{appearance}} of real negotiations. The PLO hailed the incident as successful negotiations and took <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Hassan notified Arafat of the talk and Arafat called Italian Prime Minister Craxi midday Wednesday. Arafat told him that the hijackers would release the captives if two demands were met, that the ambassadors from U.S., Italy, West Germany, and Great Britain visit the ship, then the hijackers be given safe passage off the ship.|$|E
25|$|After the Red Skull's actions cause all {{heroes and}} villains present at his defeat {{to undergo a}} 'moral inversion', Alex {{attempts}} to argue for Janet's life as the X-Men prepare to detonate a gene bomb that will destroy all non-mutants in the blast radius, but accepts the decision nevertheless. After Carnage sacrifices himself to contain the blast, Alex attempts to take <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> but Janet sees through the deception. Although the inversion is undone, the two separate for good when Alex {{is one of three}} characters (the other two being Iron Man and Sabretooth) to remain in their new state.|$|E
25|$|Of course these {{movements}} exercised tremendous {{pressure on the}} British Government and shook the government machinery. But the real importance, to my mind, lay in the effect they had on our own people, and especially the village masses.... Non-cooperation dragged {{them out of the}} mire and gave them self-respect and self-reliance.... They acted courageously and did not submit so easily to unjust oppression; their outlook widened and they began to think a little in terms of India as a whole.... It was a remarkable transformation and the Congress, under Gandhi's leadership, must have the <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

500|$|Simon left Gracie Films and The Simpsons in 1993. Simon {{commented that}} he [...] "wasn't enjoying it anymore," [...] wished to pursue other projects, and [...] "that any show I've ever worked on, it turns {{me into a}} monster. I go crazy. I hate myself." [...] Before leaving, he {{negotiated}} a deal that saw him receive {{a share of the}} show's profits every year, particularly from home media, and an executive producer credit despite not having worked on the show since 1993. The deal means he made over $10 million a year from The Simpsons; he later told Stanford Magazine that [...] "tens of millions" [...] was a closer figure. Simon commented: [...] "When I was there I thought I was underpaid. I thought I wasn't getting enough <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Now, I think it's completely the opposite. I get too much <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> And the money is ridiculous." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Brawl in the Family" [...] was {{directed}} by Matthew Nastuk {{and was the first}} full episode Joel H. Cohen received a writing <b>credit</b> <b>for.</b> <b>It</b> was the first episode on which Al Jean served as sole showrunner. The idea for the episode was pitched by Jean, who wanted to produce a sequel to the season 10 episode [...] "Viva Ned Flanders", which he thought had a [...] "loose end". The episode features Jane Kaczmarek as Judge Constance Harm, and Delroy Lindo as Gabriel.|$|E
500|$|... "Sheep" [...] {{contains}} {{a modified version}} of Psalm 23, which continues the traditional [...] "The Lord is my shepherd" [...] with words like [...] "he maketh me to hang on hooks in high places and converteth me to lamb cutlets". [...] Towards the end of the song, the eponymous sheep rise up and kill the dogs, but later retire back to their homes. Wright played the song's introduction unaccompanied on the electric piano, but did not receive a writing <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

50|$|The video premiered on BET's Access Granted on Monday August 25, 2008 at 7:30pm. It {{was made}} {{in front of a}} green screen and {{features}} many special effects.

T-Pain served as an assistant director; however, he was never <b>credited</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
500|$|However, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening later stated {{during an}} {{appearance}} at the 1998 World Animation Celebration convention in Pasadena, California that [...] "Do the Bartman" [...] was actually co-written and co-produced by Jackson, {{but he could not}} receive <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> because he was under contract to another record label. Groening told a crowd at the convention that had gathered for a [...] "The Simpsons tribute" [...] that it had [...] "always [...] amazing to me that no one ever found out that Michael Jackson wrote that song. [...] He was a big fan of the show." ...|$|E
500|$|On July23, 1923, Raphael Beck, who had {{designed}} the seal for the 1901Pan-American Exposition, wrote to Mint Director Scobey {{to complain that}} the reverse design resembled his seal, which he had copyrighted in 1899, and that Beach should be given no further <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> The letter was forwarded to the Commission of Fine Arts for comment. In October, Fraser wrote to Beck, stating that he had suggested to Beach that he use figures to represent the continents instead of maps, {{and that he had}} never seen the Pan-American seal until Scobey forwarded the letter. According to Bowers, [...] "A comparison of the 1901 and 1923 designs, however, shows that this was highly unlikely." ...|$|E
500|$|A memo sent on October 24, {{showed that}} Robert H. Justman, an {{associate}} producer on The Original Series, {{was working with}} Roddenberry on the new plans for a series, which {{was at that time}} untitled. They took several influences from the criticism of the previous series in David Gerrold's The Worlds of Star Trek, and brought the writer of [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles" [...] on as a writer. Gerrold went on to produce the series bible, although Roddenberry took the <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Roddenberry also brought together former Star Trek associate producer Eddie Milkis, who had gone on to produce series such as Happy Days. Ideas were suggested such as an android and Klingon marine, which each made it into the final series as well as the great-great-great granddaughter of James T. Kirk, which did not.|$|E
50|$|Boston {{was often}} {{involved}} in Veteran fundraisers and dedicated work toward Veterans of Foreign Wars. In 1934, Boston opened his own medical establishment called Elm Terrace Hospital, which {{would later be}} renamed North Penn Hospital in 1954. Boston continued his work at Mercy Hospital, participating in various clinical lectures throughout the 1930s and was <b>credited</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> in the Chicago Defender.|$|R
5000|$|In a July 2012 {{interview}} with Complex magazine, Jean Claude [...] "Poke" [...] Olivier- {{one-half of the}} production team the Trackmasters- claimed they were the actual producers behind the Sean [...] "Puffy" [...] Combs remix, but were never properly <b>credited</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Instead, they were only credited as session musicians for programming the drums while Combs was credited as the producer.|$|R
50|$|SuperMegaMonkey of Comics Chronology {{stated that}} despite being {{a sequel to}} the Scorpio Connection it does not really delve into the Scorpio history any further {{but that it is}} still {{interesting}} due to being written by Howard Chaykin, who drew the Scorpio Connection but didn't get any writing <b>credits</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> and probably felt some ownership or connection with the characters but that it is just a general spy adventure story.|$|R
500|$|Baker {{was finally}} {{sent to the}} front in April and {{assigned}} to the 103d Aero Squadron, formed from {{former members of the}} Lafayette Escadrille and Lafayette Flying Corps in January 1918. [...] Baker helped to bring down an enemy plane {{for the first time in}} his career on May 21, but due to a complicated system of confirming kills, he was not given <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> In a letter home describing the battle, Baker said it was the [...] "biggest thrill I ever had in my life", and compared it to the feeling after a big sports game. Throughout the spring of 1918 Baker continued to lead planes over the front, and continued to see Scott, although he began to have reservations over their future together due to the financial disparity between them. After his first confirmed kill on May 21, 1918, the French government awarded him the Croix de Guerre.|$|E
500|$|David Geffen, {{founder of}} Geffen Records, {{had the idea}} to record the album The Simpsons Sing the Blues based on The Simpsons, to be {{released}} in time for Christmas 1990. The writers wrote humorous lyrics for the actors to perform over blues and hip hop. The album faced great publicity before its release. One particular element that was highly publicized was Michael Jackson's involvement, which was denied {{around the time of the}} album's release. Early published reports attributed Jackson as the composer of [...] "Do the Bartman", which Groening denied in a press release. However, Groening revealed in 1998 that [...] "Do the Bartman" [...] was actually co-written and co-produced by Jackson, but he could not receive <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> because he was under contract to another record label. Jackson was a fan of The Simpsons, especially Bart, and had called the producers one night offering to write Bart a number one single and do a guest spot on the show, which is how [...] "Do the Bartman" [...] came about. Jackson eventually guest-starred in the episode [...] "Stark Raving Dad".|$|E
500|$|There {{has been}} broad {{agreement}} among historians that McKinley's election {{was at the}} time of a transition between two political eras, dubbed the Third and Fourth Party Systems. Kenneth F. Warren emphasizes the national commitment to a pro-business, industrial, and modernizing program, represented by McKinley. Historian Daniel P. Klinghard argued that McKinley's personal control of the 1896 campaign gave him the opportunity to reshape the presidency—rather than simply follow the party platform—by representing himself as the voice of the people. Republican Karl Rove exalted McKinley as the model for a sweeping political realignment behind George W. Bush in the 2000s,—a realignment that did not happen. [...] Some political scientists, such as David Mayhew, questioned whether the 1896 election truly represented a realignment, thereby placing in issue whether McKinley deserves <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Historian Michael J. Korzi argued in 2005 that while it is tempting to see McKinley as the key figure in the transition from congressional domination of government to the modern, powerful president, this change was an incremental process through the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E
