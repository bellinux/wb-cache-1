The United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination also sent a team to assist the efforts of the Haitian government, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) also activated its crew within the country. Ahead of the storm, officials shut down the Hugo Chávez and Toussaint Louverture international airports, causing several flights to be canceled. The airport in Port-au-Prince remained closed until October6, only allowing in planes carrying humanitarian aid. Officials also halted travel by cars during the storm's passage until October5.|$|E

40|$|D. P. H. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2015. Includes bibliographical references. Physical {{activity}} (PA) is {{an essential}} health-promoting behavior. Unfortunately, the majority of U. S. adults are not sufficiently active, and certain groups are even less {{likely to engage in}} regular PA. To increase population-levels of PA and resolve PA disparities, <b>community</b> <b>interventions</b> are needed to address multiple levels of a social ecological framework. The purpose of this dissertation research was to contribute to the knowledge about effective <b>community</b> <b>interventions</b> for PA, with a particular focus on the process of engaging community members to participate in the design and implementation of <b>community</b> <b>interventions.</b> The dissertation research was comprised of three studies. The first study was a systematic literature review of community-based participatory research interventions for PA. The major finding of the systematic review was that community participation was integrated rather inconsistently in the intervention process, but nearly all interventions were able to impact multiple levels of a social ecological framework. In the second study, a grounded theory approach was used to develop a theory of change for how a community coalition, Get Fit Kaua‘i, was able to create policy and environmental changes. This qualitative study was comprised of semi-structured interviews with a purposeful sample of 25 coalition stakeholders. The theory resulting from the interviews highlighted the importance of capacity building, the influence of community context, and the complementary programmatic activities that enabled built environment policy changes. In the third study, a secondary data analysis employed structural equation modeling to assess the cross-sectional association between perceived social and built environment factors with PA levels in a sample of 3, 626 Hawai‘i adults. The resulting model confirmed that <b>community</b> <b>interventions</b> must address intrapersonal factors, along with modifiable factors in the built and social environments. Together, the dissertation studies contribute to the evidence supporting the utility of <b>community</b> <b>interventions</b> to promote PA. The studies reflect the challenges facing <b>community</b> <b>interventions</b> that seek to address the upper levels of policy and environmental change in the social ecological model. Based on the dissertation findings and study limitations, the final chapter provides practice implications and directions for future research...|$|R

The aim of the review was to systematically assess {{the current state of}} knowledge about the effectiveness of population-based whole of <b>community</b> <b>interventions</b> in preventing excessive population weight gain. Systematic searches of electronic databases (1990 – 2011) and reference lists of included trials and previous reviews were conducted to identify interventions to prevent excessive weight gain. Population-based, whole of <b>community</b> <b>interventions</b> were defined as those targeting the weight status of a population characterised along geographical boundaries. The review included eight trials. All of the identified trials targeted children or adolescents. Seven trials reported a significant effect favouring the intervention on at least one measure of adiposity. Meta-analysis of six trials revealed a small reduction in BMI z-score among participants in <b>intervention</b> <b>communities</b> (mean difference (MD) − 0. 09; 95 % confidence interval (CI) − 0. 16 to − 0. 02).

40|$|Background: Non-adherence to {{antidepressants}} generates {{higher costs}} {{for the treatment of}} depression. Little is known about the cost-effectiveness of pharmacist's interventions aimed at improving adherence to antidepressants. The study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a <b>community</b> pharmacist <b>intervention</b> in comparison with usual care in depressed patients initiating treatment with antidepressants in primary care. Methods: Patients were recruited by general practitioners and randomized to <b>community</b> pharmacist <b>intervention</b> (87) that received an educational intervention and usual care (92). Adherence to antidepressants, clinical symptoms, Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs), use of healthcare services and productivity losses were measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Results: There {{were no significant differences between}} groups in costs or effects. From a societal perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the <b>community</b> pharmacist <b>intervention</b> compared with usual care was 1, 866 for extra adherent patient and 9, 872 per extra QALY. In terms of remission of depressive symptoms, the usual care dominated the <b>community</b> pharmacist <b>intervention.</b> If willingness to pay (WTP) is 30, 000 per extra adherent patient, remission of symptoms or QALYs, the probability of the <b>community</b> pharmacist <b>intervention</b> being cost-effective was 0. 71, 0. 46 and 0. 75, respectively (societal perspective).

40|$|Earlier {{this year}} the BMC {{portfolio}} was enriched by a new journal BMC Obesity. Here, we present the {{aims and objectives of}} the section on Lifestyle and <b>Community</b> <b>Interventions.</b> Innovative research is needed. Preventing or managing obesity requires addressing different determinants across multiple levels where diverse levers and stakeholders can play a critical role. Interactions of these determinants within and between systems need to be studied. How to leverage, manage and measure this complexity underlies the innovation that is needed in the next generation of obesity interventions. The ambition of the Lifestyle and <b>Community</b> <b>Interventions</b> section is to provide a space for innovative research, including research that falls outside the traditional comfort zone. We welcome studies of heterogeneous designs, including those of qualitative, quantitative, mixed and systems methodologies. Studies of interest include not only outcomes research of interventions but also process evaluation, cost effectiveness or cost-benefit analysis, and implementation and dissemination research. Innovations that integrate diverse intervention levers or combine primary and secondary levels of prevention are particularly encouraged.

40|$|Background: Cigarette {{smoking is}} one of the leading causes of {{preventable}} death in the world. Decisions to smoke are often made within a broad social context and therefore <b>community</b> <b>interventions</b> using coordinated, multi-component programmesmay be effective in influencing the smoking behaviour of young people. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of multi-component <b>community</b> based <b>interventions</b> in influencing smoking behaviour, which includes preventing the uptake of smoking in young people. Search methods: The Tobacco Addiction group’s specialised register, Medline and other health, psychology and public policy electronic databases were searched, the bibliographies of identified studies were checked and raw data was requested from study authors. Searches were updated in August 2010. Selection criteria: Randomized and non randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of multi-component <b>community</b> <b>interventions</b> compared to no intervention or to single component or school-based programmes only. Reported outcomes had to include smoking behaviour in young people under the age of 25 years. Data collection and analysis: Information relating to the characteristics and the content of <b>community</b> <b>interventions,</b> participants, outcomes and methods of the study was extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second. Studies were combined in a meta-analysis where possible and reported in narrative synthesis in text and table. Main results: Twenty-five studies were included in the review and sixty-eight studies did not meet all of the inclusion criteria. All studies used a controlled trial design, with fifteen using random allocation of schools or communities. One study reported a reduction in short-term smoking prevalence (twelvemonths or less), while nine studies detected significant long-term effects. Two studies reported significantly lower smoking rates in the control population while the remaining thirteen studies showed no significant difference between groups. Improvements were seen in secondary outcomes for intentions to smoke in six out of eight studies, attitudes in five out of nine studies, perceptions in two out of six studies and knowledge in three out of six studies, while significant differences in favour of the control were seen in one of the nine studies assessing attitudes and one of six studies assessing perceptions. Authors’ conclusions: There is some evidence to support the effectiveness of <b>community</b> <b>interventions</b> in reducing the uptake of smoking in young people, but the evidence is not strong and contains a number of methodological flaws.
