Knowing he will not receive any funds, Chellappa decides to scare Viswanathan and narrates a horror story. Nagesh later said this was Gopu's idea; [...] "You know how director Dada [...] tells a story. Just follow the pattern". Nagesh and Balaiah completed shooting the scene in a single take. According to film historian Mohan V. Raman, this scene {{was inspired by the}} way in which Mirasi narrated the basic storyline of his directorial venture Puthiya Paravai (1964) to its lead actor Sivaji Ganesan's brother V. C. Shanmugham who, impressed with the narration, called Sridhar to listen to it. Kanchana recalled filming the scene and said, [...] "I was standing behind, trembling to <b>control</b> <b>my</b> laughter. The moment the scene was over, the entire team began to laugh, so hard, we soon had tears running down our faces." [...] The final length of the film was [...]|$|E
500|$|After his {{performances}} in the AHL, Hextall was invited to the Flyers' training camp as a long-shot. His play in four exhibition games convinced Flyers' coach Mike Keenan to call up Hextall to the NHL, and to play him in the opening game of the season, against the Edmonton Oilers. Hextall conceded a goal from the first shot he faced in the game, but allowed no further shots past him, leading his side to a 2–1 victory. Hextall continued to display the aggressive nature with which he had always played, swinging his stick at Brad Smith and Troy Murray early in his first NHL season. Despite these swipes, Hextall claimed at the time that, [...] "I used to be worse, I've learned to <b>control</b> <b>my</b> temper." [...] Two months after making these comments, Hextall {{was involved in a}} fight with opposing New Jersey Devils goaltender Alain Chevrier. Having lost to the Devils, the Flyers wanted revenge for Steve Richmond's punch on Kjell Samuelsson {{at the end of the}} game; Hextall targeted Chevrier in a fight labelled by Chico Resch as [...] "like a heavyweight against a lightweight." [...] Hextall and seven other players were fined $300 each for their part in the brawl.|$|E
500|$|Over 13 {{seasons with}} the White Sox, Pierce was the ace of the {{pitching}} staff, leading the team in wins nine times and in strikeouts eight times. He was Chicago's Opening Day starter seven times (1951–52, 1954, 1956–59), and started the home opener in 1953 and 1961. He had an outstanding fastball and an excellent curveball, and in 1951 added the slider (for which he used his motion for the curve rather than the fastball) as a third strong pitch, {{as well as a}} changeup. He worked quickly with an over-the-top motion, dropping his back shoulder in a style similar to that later used by Sandy Koufax. In 1957, Paul Richards noted of Pierce's early style: [...] "He had a tendency to windmill in his delivery, which makes the ball spin too much and takes the life out of it. He flashed his curve-the Yankees always knew when he was throwing a curve. But mainly Bill didn't want to throw anything but fast balls in the old days. He laughed at the change-of-pace and the slider, so most of the strong right-hand hitters were laying back for him, waiting for a fast ball down the middle." [...] After Pierce finally tried the slider against the Yankees, to great effect, Richards noted, [...] "Then, for a while there, he began throwing nothing but sliders. He finally learned about that, too. Even today Pierce will pitch a whole ball game and almost never throw anything but fast balls. But only on certain days." [...] Yankees star Joe DiMaggio was among those praising Pierce's ability, reportedly remarking, [...] "That little so-and-so is a marvel. So little – and all that speed. And I mean speed! He got me out of there on a fastball in the ninth that I'd have needed a telescope to see." [...] Richards became Chicago's manager in 1951, and worked with Pierce to develop his two new pitches and slow down his pace, as well as significantly improve his control; Pierce later recalled, [...] "I learned to <b>control</b> <b>my</b> fastball better [...] Developing the slider helped me tremendously because it gave me a third out pitch. I threw it almost as hard as my fastball, but I could throw it for strikes better than the fast ball or good curve ... Richards made me work on it, and it took me about two years before it was consistent." [...] After issuing 249 walks in 391 innings in 1949–1950, Pierce gave up only 73 walks in 240 innings in 1951, and averaged more than 3 walks per 9 innings in three seasons afterward. His 1951 ERA of 3.03 was fourth best in the league, and he ranked sixth in 1952 with a mark of 2.57. On September 21, 1952 he broke Doc White's 1907 club record of 141 strikeouts by a left-hander, ending the season with 144.|$|E

Fortunately, I was an acrobat growing up, and a very very good one — I won a lot of contests — so I knew how to <b>control</b> <b>my</b> body and be 'quiet.' You had to do that, you had to be very still and lay there and be a 'good patient.' A young actor will do anything to get their mug on the screen! I remember that the makeup process took about three hours. I had to lay back and be perfectly still as they put this plaster mold on my face. After seeing the test, everyone was very enthusiastic about going ahead with making Planet of the Apes. But they felt the makeup needed a little more work and perfecting before it would look good on screen." ...|$|E

She later said in interviews that she didn't bother correcting the rumors because people in show business hire drunks all the time, but not people who are sick." [...] Turner has had well-publicized problems with alcohol, which she used as an escape from the pain and symptoms of acute rheumatoid arthritis. Turner has admitted that because of her illness, she was in constant unbearable agony and that as a result, the people she was closest to would suffer from it, as she was constantly drinking to relieve the pain and it made her a very difficult person. A few weeks after leaving the production of the play The Graduate in November 2002, Turner was admitted into the Marworth hospital in Waverly, Pennsylvania, for the treatment of alcoholism. [...] "I have no problem with alcohol when I'm working," [...] she explained. [...] "It's when I'm home alone that I can't <b>control</b> <b>my</b> drinking...I was going toward excess.
