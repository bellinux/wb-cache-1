5|$|The {{alphabetic}} {{country codes}} were first included in ISO 3166 in 1974, and the numeric country codes were first included in 1981. The country codes {{have been published}} as ISO 3166-1 since 1997, when ISO 3166 was expanded into three parts, with ISO 3166-2 defining <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> subdivisions and ISO 3166-3 defining <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> former countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{hierarchical}} administrative subdivision <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> Svalbard is SJ.SV and for Jan Mayen is SJ.JM.|$|E
40|$|In {{a virtual}} machine interpreter, the <b>code</b> <b>for</b> each virtual machine {{instruction}} has similarities to <b>code</b> <b>for</b> other instructions. We present an interpreter generator that automatically generates <b>code</b> <b>for</b> the virtual machine instructions from simple instruction descriptions; it generates <b>code</b> <b>for</b> the virtual machine interpreter, for generating virtual machine <b>code,</b> <b>for</b> virtual machine <b>code</b> disassembly, <b>for</b> tracing, and for profiling...|$|R
5000|$|Developers make {{software}} {{for the world to}} use. The job of a developer is to crank out code -- fresh <b>code</b> <b>for</b> new products, <b>code</b> fixes <b>for</b> maintenance, <b>code</b> <b>for</b> business logic, and <b>code</b> <b>for</b> supporting libraries.|$|R
5000|$|HTTP status <b>code</b> <b>for</b> [...] "Payment Required", area <b>code</b> <b>for</b> Nebraska ...|$|R
5|$|FIPS County Codes are 5 digit codes. All County <b>Codes</b> <b>for</b> KY {{begin with}} 21 (in the format 21XXX where XXX are the numbers {{listed in the}} table below).|$|E
5|$|The cagA gene <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> one of {{the major}} H. pylori {{virulence}} proteins. Bacterial strains with the cagA gene are associated with an ability to cause ulcers. The cagA gene <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> a relatively long (1186-amino acid) protein. The cag pathogenicity island (PAI) has about 30 genes, part of which code for a complex type IV secretion system. The low GC-content of the cag PAI relative {{to the rest of the}} Helicobacter genome suggests the island was acquired by horizontal transfer from another bacterial species.|$|E
5|$|The genome of {{rotavirus}} {{consists of}} 11 unique double helix molecules of RNA which are 18,555 nucleotides in total. Each helix, or segment, is a gene, numbered 1 to 11 by decreasing size. Each gene <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> one protein, except genes 9, which <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> two. The RNA {{is surrounded by}} a three-layered icosahedral protein capsid. Viral particles are up to 76.5nm in diameter and are not enveloped.|$|E
5000|$|HTTP status <b>code</b> <b>for</b> [...] "Request Entity Too Large", area <b>code</b> <b>for</b> Western Massachusetts.|$|R

5|$|The list {{of names}} in Country and Region <b>Codes</b> <b>for</b> Statistical Use of the UN Statistics Division {{is based on the}} {{bulletin}} Country Names and other UN sources.|$|E
5|$|Besides sermons Wulfstan {{was also}} {{instrumental}} in drafting law <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> both kings Æthelred the Unready and Cnut the Great of England. He {{is considered one}} of the two major writers of the late Anglo-Saxon period in England. After his death in 1023, miracles were said to have occurred at his tomb, but attempts to have him declared a saint never bore fruit.|$|E
5|$|DJ Hero 2 {{was sold}} with various promotional items. Within Europe and select stores in North America, players that {{purchased}} {{the game in}} one of two bundle packages (either with one or two turntable controllers) received the predecessor DJ Hero free. Other North American stores offered carrying cases for the turntables, MP3 versions of selected mixes, or redemption <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> in-game customization options.|$|E
50|$|The ISO 639-3 <b>code</b> <b>for</b> Irish Sign Language is 'isg'; 'isl' is the <b>code</b> <b>for</b> Icelandic.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} subject <b>code</b> <b>for</b> Mathematics is G1, and {{the principal}} subject <b>code</b> <b>for</b> Physics is F3.|$|R
5000|$|HTTP status <b>code</b> <b>for</b> [...] "Expectation Failed". Also {{the area}} <b>code</b> <b>for</b> southwestern Missouri, {{including}} Springfield, and Joplin.|$|R
5|$|Genes are {{the primary}} units of {{inheritance}} in all organisms. A gene is a unit of heredity and corresponds to a region of DNA that influences the form or function of an organism in specific ways. All organisms, from bacteria to animals, share the same basic machinery that copies and translates DNA into proteins. Cells transcribe a DNA gene into an RNA version of the gene, and a ribosome then translates the RNA into a sequence of amino acids known as a protein. The translation code from RNA codon to amino acid {{is the same for}} most organisms. For example, a sequence of DNA that <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> insulin in humans also <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> insulin when inserted into other organisms, such as plants.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the specific amino acid codes, placeholders are used in cases where chemical or crystallographic analysis of a peptide or protein cannot conclusively determine {{the identity of a}} residue. They are also used to summarise conserved protein sequence motifs. The use of single letters to indicate sets of similar residues is similar to the use of abbreviation <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> degenerate bases.|$|E
5|$|The pre-release playable demo for Halo Wars {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in the October 2007 issue of Official Xbox Magazine, and it became available for download on February 5, 2009; redemption <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> early access were given starting January 29. According to Microsoft, the game demo was downloaded by more than 2million Xbox Live Gold members {{in the first five}} days, and set a record for most demo downloads on the service.|$|E
50|$|<b>Code</b> <b>for</b> America Commons (formerly Civic Commons) is {{a project}} by <b>Code</b> <b>for</b> America and OpenPlans focused on {{reducing}} government IT costs by helping government entities share code and best practices. It was initially launched as Civic Commons as an independent nonprofit organization, but later became a program of <b>Code</b> <b>for</b> America. The project is a coordinated effort between <b>Code</b> <b>for</b> America, OpenPlans, and the District of Columbia's Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO).|$|R
40|$|Plasmid DNAs {{obtained}} from 18 Escherichia coli isolates that hybridized with the heat-stable b (ST-b) enterotoxin gene probe were examined by Southern blot analysis <b>for</b> genes <b>coding</b> <b>for</b> heat-labile, ST-a, and ST-b enterotoxins with specific radiolabeled DNA probes. Four E. coli isolates contained plasmids <b>coding</b> <b>for</b> both heat-labile and ST-b enterotoxins, and one isolate contained a plasmid <b>coding</b> <b>for</b> ST-a and ST-b. Five of 11 isolates of antibiotic-resistant enterotoxigenic E. coli isolates containing ST-b-coding DNA transferred a plasmid <b>coding</b> <b>for</b> both antibiotic resistance and ST-b to E. coli K- 12, {{suggesting that the}} widespread use of antibiotics could increase the distribution of genes <b>coding</b> <b>for</b> ST-b...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] (CEVNI; European <b>Code</b> <b>for</b> Navigation on Inland Waterways) is the European <b>code</b> <b>for</b> rivers, {{canals and}} lakes {{in most of}} Europe.|$|R
5|$|A {{mitochondrion}} contains DNA, {{which is}} organized as several {{copies of a}} single, usually circular, chromosome. This mitochondrial chromosome contains genes for redox proteins, {{such as those of}} the respiratory chain. The CoRR hypothesis proposes that this co-location is required for redox regulation. The mitochondrial genome <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> some RNAs of ribosomes, and the 22 tRNAs necessary for the translation of messenger RNAs into protein. The circular structure is also found in prokaryotes. The proto-mitochondrion was probably closely related to the Rickettsia. However, the exact relationship of the ancestor of mitochondria to the alphaproteobacteria and whether the mitochondrion was formed at the same time or after the nucleus, remains controversial.|$|E
5|$|Any {{of these}} {{conditions}} that occurs in a family can indicate a diagnosis of Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, though it is only confirmed by a genetic test for a mutation in the FLCN gene, which <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> the protein folliculin. Though its function is not fully understood, {{it appears to be}} a tumor suppressor gene that restricts cell growth and division. Versions of FLCN have been found in other animals, including fruit flies, German shepherds, rats, and mice. The disease was discovered in 1977, but the connection with FLCN was not elucidated until 2002, after kidney cancer, collapsed lungs, and pulmonary cysts were all definitively connected to BHD.|$|E
5|$|At the Playground, {{the former}} SSR base that {{now serves as}} S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters, Director Phil Coulson recognizes the {{importance}} of the Obelisk, noting that it is the first 0-8-4, an object of unknown origin. Hydra double-agent, and S.H.I.E.L.D. prisoner, Grant Ward tells Agent Skye of secret frequencies Hydra uses to communicate, and Agent Billy Koenig intercepts Creel's next directive—to use the family of Brigadier General Glenn Talbot as leverage to find the Obelisk. Agent Melinda May, Skye, Hunter, and Hartley help Talbot fight off Creel, before abducting Talbot and deceiving him into giving them access <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> a U.S. military base near Washington, D.C. that contains numerous confiscated S.H.I.E.L.D. assets.|$|E
50|$|The Golomb <b>code</b> <b>for</b> this {{distribution}} {{is equivalent to}} the Huffman <b>code</b> <b>for</b> the same probabilities, if it were possible to compute the Huffman code.|$|R
5000|$|Lastly, <b>Code</b> <b>for</b> All (part of <b>Code</b> <b>for</b> America) organizes similar efforts {{outside the}} US, {{particularly}} Brigades and fellowship programs in {{countries around the}} world.|$|R
50|$|Charlie, Charlie, Charlie is the <b>code</b> <b>for</b> a {{security}} threat aboard Royal Caribbean ships and the <b>code</b> <b>for</b> upcoming helicopter winch operations aboard c-bed accommodation vessels.|$|R
5|$|Damage was {{eventually}} estimated at $100million, and many countries {{responded to the}} emergency with donations of blankets, tents, clothing, and food. Rescue teams were also dispatched to assist local volunteers in finding survivors trapped under the debris. The destruction around the earthquake's epicenter was, in places, almost total; this {{has been attributed to}} poor construction practices in rural areas, and imparted momentum to a growing movement for changes in building <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> earthquake-safe buildings. With 1 in 3,000 deaths in Iran attributable to earthquakes, a US geophysicist has suggested that a country-wide rebuilding program would be needed to address the ongoing public safety concerns.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{about the}} need to upgrade and {{renovate}} City Hall began anew in 1988. In 1994, proposals were made to remodel and update the structure to meet modern building codes, with an estimated cost of $16million. Work was to include replacing the concrete floors, structural upgrades, and restoring the original light corridors that penetrated all four floors of the building. In March 1995, plans were made to renovate the then-100-year-old structure. The estimated $22-million project was proposed due to the building failing to comply with the city <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> earthquakes and fires.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{different}} in structure from other retroviruses. It is roughly spherical with a diameter of about 120nm, around 60times smaller than a red blood cell. It is composed of two copies of positive single-stranded RNA that <b>codes</b> <b>for</b> the virus's nine genes enclosed by a conical capsid composed of 2,000 copies of the viral protein p24. The single-stranded RNA is tightly bound to nucleocapsid proteins, p7, and enzymes needed {{for the development of}} the virion such as reverse transcriptase, proteases, ribonuclease and integrase. A matrix composed of the viral protein p17 surrounds the capsid ensuring the integrity of the virion particle.|$|E
5000|$|... is a {{language}} <b>code</b> <b>for</b> Portuguese, defined by ISO standards (see ISO 639-1 and ISO 3166-1 alpha-2).There is no ISO <b>code</b> <b>for</b> spoken or written Brazilian Portuguese.|$|R
