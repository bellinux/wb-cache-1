25|$|Morgan hired nearly 50 {{engineers}} {{to analyze the}} Miami Valley watershed and precipitation patterns and to determine the flood volume. They analyzed European flood data for information about general flooding patterns. Based on this analysis, Morgan presented eight different flood <b>control</b> <b>plans</b> to the City of Dayton officials in October 1913. The city selected a plan based on the flood control system in the Loire Valley in France. It consisted of five earthen dams and modifications to the river channel through Dayton. The dams would have conduits to release {{a limited amount of}} water, and a wider river channel would use larger levees supported by a series of training levees. Flood storage areas behind the dams would be used as farmland between floods. Morgan's goal was to develop a flood plan that would handle 140 percent of the water from the 1913 flood. The analysis had determined the river channel boundaries for the expected 1,000-year major floods, and all businesses located in that area were to be relocated.|$|E

At {{present in}} China control {{strategy}} and <b>control</b> <b>plan</b> of highway monitor system are realized by collecting traffic environmental information, analyzing and processing by computer technology, publishing induction or banned instructions automatically and uniting the overall coordination {{of the road}} network traffic operation. In recent years in some provinces monitor plans of the whole distance have been started and monitor strategies of the whole distance have been made completely {{in order to make}} highway transportation safer, more open and more comfortable. With the help of the engineering experience and the characteristics of control strategy and <b>control</b> <b>plan</b> of highway monitor system in some provinces and cities,I study the control strategy and <b>control</b> <b>plan</b> of highway monitor system and in detail analyze four cases that are the traffic flow <b>control</b> <b>plan,</b> the traffic incident <b>control</b> <b>plan,</b> the meteorological environment <b>control</b> <b>plan</b> and the emergency phone alarm <b>control</b> <b>plan</b> by research on the control method, the control process, the facility linkage control and the control result...|$|R

By reformulating the optimization problem as a single machine scheduling problem, the core optimization algorithm, termed a schedule-driven intersection control algorithm, is able to compute optimized intersection <b>control</b> <b>plans</b> over an extended horizon on a second-by-second basis.|$|E
