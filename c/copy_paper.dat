5|$|Arrington {{completed}} much of {{the research}} for Great Basin Kingdom in the LDS Church library archives. Aware of the LDS Church Archives's hostility to academic research at the time, Arrington took John A. Widtsoe's advice and started his research with published materials and theses, working up to unpublished materials. Arrington was able to circumvent A. William Lund's policy of personally approving all notes taken in the archives: Arrington took his notes on a typewriter using carbon <b>copy</b> <b>paper,</b> enabling him to leave a copy with Lund and take his own copy home. In order to rewrite his dissertation into Great Basin Kingdom, Arrington took a sabbatical 1956–1957 and was granted a fellowship at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{reactions}} involved in Bynesian decay require a certain quantity of {{moisture in the}} air {{in order for them to}} take place, keeping the air somewhat dry, i.e. keeping the environmental relative humidity under control is beneficial. This is achieved by careful monitoring of the relative humidity (using instruments such as a hygrometer), and applying dehumidifiers when necessary; sometimes, simple air conditioning systems may suffice. Extremely low humidity can damage some specimens, so caution is recommended. Usually, a relative humidity maintained around 50% is considered to be adequate. Applying sorbents containing a strong base, such as potassium hydroxide, inside the storage environment to protect the specimens against degradation is also possible. <b>Copy</b> <b>paper</b> or KOH-impregnated filter paper are some low cost examples of sorbents which can be used. These strong bases have a preference to react with acid, thus they compete successfully with the calcium carbonate specimens for any acidic vapors that may be present. The bases also help reduce the overall acid concentration inside the enclosed space.|$|E

Tunis also played a doubles match against the French women's champion Suzanne Lenglen. Returning to the U.S. {{at the end of}} the summer, he dropped in on former Harvard classmate Lawrence Winship, the Sunday editor of The Boston Globe. When Winship learned that Tunis actually knew the flamboyant Lenglen, he insisted he write an article about her for the Globe before leaving the building. The pressure of that deadline caused him such anxiety that after half an hour of struggle he went to the building's fire escape, [...] "leaned over the railing, and threw up. I'll never forget it. I wiped my face with <b>copy</b> <b>paper.</b> But I did the story." [...] Between 1920 and 1940 Tunis freelanced for a number of major magazines, including Reader's Digest, Harper's, Atlantic Monthly, Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post and Esquire, writing primarily on two topics: sports and education. He also covered sports for the New York Evening Post from 1925 to 1932 and had a weekly column in The New Yorker. According to Norman Cousins in Writing for Love or Money, Tunis was known for producing [...] "fact-packed articles based upon research". Working six days a week and taking the seventh to play tennis, Tunis published over 2,000 articles and short stories, becoming one ofAmerica's premier sportswriters.|$|E

30|$|This study {{demonstrated}} that the integrated LCA and MCDA approach provided a structured and comprehensive methodology for impact analysis and environmental decision making. In the background of growing concerns over global warming, carbon emission became an important factor. Carbon footprint, however, should not be merely one element in decision-making. The developed method could thus improve previous studies in comprehensive assessment on carbon footprints of products and service on multiple issues. The developed method was then applied to <b>copying</b> <b>paper</b> and printing services of China. The application indicated that the hybrid MCDA-LCA method can provide a structured and comprehensive methodology for accounting CFP as well as assessing environmental impacts of products and services. The {{results indicated that the}} most emergent environmental impacts caused by paper production and printing services were resource consumption and hazardous waste. At the same time, {{due to a lack of}} life-cycle inventory data of planting trees, carbon storage was not included in system boundary of <b>copying</b> <b>paper.</b> The next study would be furthered in detailed carbon emission of paper-making industry. Moreover, when purchasing <b>copying</b> <b>paper,</b> consumers should pay attention on coal consumption of the product. In printing industry, VOC of printing services should be taken serious consideration in China.|$|R

2500|$|A polychlorinated {{biphenyl}} (PCB) is an {{organic chlorine compound}} with the formula C12H10−xClx. [...] Polychlorinated biphenyls were once widely deployed as dielectric and coolant fluids in electrical apparatus, carbonless <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> and in heat transfer fluids. [...] Because of their longevity, PCBs are still widely in use, even though their manufacture has declined drastically since the 1960s, when a host of problems were identified. Because of PCBs' environmental toxicity and classification as a persistent organic pollutant, PCB production was banned by the United States Congress in 1979 and by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in 2001. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), rendered PCBs as definite carcinogens in humans. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), PCBs cause cancer in animals and are probable human carcinogens. Many rivers and buildings including schools, parks, and other sites are contaminated with PCBs, {{and there have been}} contaminations of food supplies with the substances.|$|E
2500|$|BisphenolA is a {{preferred}} color developer in carbonless <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> and thermal {{point of sale}} receipt paper. When used in thermal paper, BPA is present as [...] "free" [...] (i.e., discrete, non-polymerized) BPA, {{which is likely to}} be more available for exposure than BPA polymerized into a resin or plastic. Upon handling, BPA in thermal paper can be transferred to skin, and there is some concern that residues on hands could be ingested through incidental hand-to-mouth contact. Furthermore, some studies suggest that dermal absorption may contribute some small fraction to the overall human exposure. European data indicate that the use of BPA in paper may also contribute to the presence of BPA in the stream of recycled paper and in landfills. Although there are no estimates for the amount of BPA used in thermal paper in the United States, in Western Europe, the volume of BPA reported to be used in thermal paper in 2005/2006 was 1,890 tonnes per year, while total production was estimated at 1,150,000 tonnes per year. [...] (Figures taken from 2012 EPA draft paper.) Studies document potential spreading and accumulation of BPA in paper recycling, suggesting its presence for decades in paper recycling loop even after a hypothetical ban. Epoxy resin may or may not contain BPA, and is employed to bind gutta percha in some root canal procedures.|$|E

Free BPA {{is found in}} high concentration in thermal paper and carbonless <b>copy</b> <b>paper,</b> which {{would be expected to}} be more available for exposure than BPA bound into resin or plastic. [...] Popular uses of thermal paper include receipts, event and cinema tickets, labels, and airline tickets. A Swiss study found that 11 of 13 thermal printing papers contained [...] (BPA). Upon dry finger contact with a thermal paper receipt, roughly [...] BPA (...) was transferred to the forefinger and the middle finger. For wet or greasy fingers approximately [...] more was transferred. Extraction of BPA from the fingers was possible up to [...] after exposure. Further, it has been demonstrated that thermal receipts placed in contact with paper currency in a wallet for 24 hours cause a dramatic increase in the concentration of BPA in paper currency, making paper money a secondary source of exposure. Another study has identified BPA in all of the waste paper samples analysed (newspapers, magazines, office paper, etc.), indicating direct results of contamination through paper recycling. [...] Free BPA can readily be transferred to skin, and residues on hands can be ingested. Bodily intake through dermal absorption (99% of which comes from handling receipts) has been shown for the general population to be 0.219ng/kg bw/day (occupationally exposed persons absorb higher amounts at 16.3ng/kg bw/day) whereas aggregate intake (food/beverage/environment) for adults is estimated at 0.36–0.43 μg/kg bw/day (estimated intake for occupationally exposed adults is 0.043–100 μg/kg bw/day).|$|E
