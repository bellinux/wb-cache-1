5|$|According to the Holy Land Handicraft Cooperative Society, the blowing {{technique}} employed is {{the same}} as was used by the ancient Phoenicians, though archaeologists and historians of glass agree that glassblowing was not common until the last few centuries BCE. Molten glass is withdrawn from a furnace on the end of an iron pipe, which is blown into as a metal tool called a kammasha is used to shape the glass. It is returned to the furnace and reshaped by the same process before being detached from the pipe and placed into a <b>cooling</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{first step}} in the {{manufacture}} of a typical shoe polish is the melting of the wax with the highest melting point in an electric heater. Following this, all other waxes are added, usually by descending order of melting point. While this wax is held at a constant temperature, the emulsion—a mixture of the various oils and, if used, fats, is then heated separately, at around 85°C. The heated emulsion is then added to the waxes, along with distilled water. When the mixture reaches around 80°C, turpentine oil is added. This mixture is then mixed and continually stirred for half an hour. Dyes are added and mixed in turpentine oil if it is not a neutral polish. The mixed mass is reduced slowly to 50°C, and as its viscosity increases, it is poured through a closed funnel into a <b>cooling</b> <b>chamber.</b> The poured mass is allowed to settle slowly, providing uniform distribution. The process is considered straightforward and the required equipment is relatively easy to acquire. The cost of establishing shoe polish manufacturing facilities has been estimated at around $600,000 (as of 2005).|$|E
25|$|In {{simplest}} form, {{a condenser}} can {{consist of a}} single tube of glass or metal, where the flow of outside air produces the cooling. In a further simple form, condensers consist of concentric glass tubes, with the tube through which the hot gases begin to pass running {{the length of the}} apparatus. The second tube defines an outer chamber through which air, water, or other cooling fluids can pass to reduce the temperature of the gasses to afford the condensation; hence, the outer tube (or, as designs become more complex, outer <b>cooling</b> <b>chamber)</b> has an inlet and an outlet to allow the cooling fluid to enter and exit.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- A {{study was}} {{conducted}} on the impact of soil inter-space bulk density and moisture content on the vitamin A content of stored oranges in passive evaporative cooling structures. Two sets of four different types of passive evaporative cooling structures made of two different materials, clay and aluminium were constructed. One set consists of four separate <b>cooling</b> <b>chambers.</b> Two <b>cooling</b> <b>chambers</b> were made with aluminium container (round and rectangular shapes) and the other two were made of clay container (round and rectangular). These four containers were separately inserted inside bigger clay pots and lateritic walls inter- spaced with clay soil of 5 cm (to form tin-in-pot, pot-in-pot, tin-in-wall and wall-in wall) with the outside structure wrapped with jute sack. The other set followed the same pattern with interspacing of 10 cm. The two sets (5 cm and 10 cm interspaced soil) were constantly wetted with salt solution (sodium chloride, NaCl)) at intervals of between 2 to 4 hours depending on the rate of evaporation to keep the soil in moist condition. In addition, the control has no fans and the inner <b>cooling</b> <b>chambers</b> were not lined with polyethylene nylon while the other two sets have fans and their inner <b>cooling</b> <b>chambers</b> lined with polyethylene nylon Freshly harvested oranges were used for the experiment and the inter-space soil bulk density, soil moisture content and vitamin A content of stored oranges were determined at interval of three days for a period of three weeks.

40|$|O presente estudo teve por objetivo avaliar a evolução da {{microbiota}} do ovo integral líquido (OIL) armazenado em câmaras de resfriamento e tanques de expansão, verificando a eficiência desses métodos de conservação. Foram obtidas 144 amostras, sendo 72 provenientes de três propriedades com armazenamento de OIL em tanques de expansão e 72 de três propriedades com armazenamento de OIL em câmaras de resfriamento. Foi pesquisada a presença de Salmonella spp. e quantificados os micro-organismos aeróbios mesófilos, psicrotróficos, coliformes totais, Escherichia coli e Staphylococcus aureus, acompanhando a evolução desses micro-organismos entre os intervalos de tempo de 0, 24, 48 e 72 horas, sob temperaturas entre 2 º e 5 ºC. Constatou-se que no OIL estudado, tanto as câmaras de resfriamento quanto os tanques de expansão foram eficientes no controle da evolução dos micro-organismos quantificados, exceto no controle dos psicrotróficos. O OIL avaliado revelou grande contaminação advinda do processo de produção e quebra que antecedem a refrigeração. A presença de Salmonella spp. foi constatada em 36 (75 %) das amostras analisadas. Em ambos os tipos de conservação, observou-se contagens iniciais acima dos padrões estabelecidos pela legislação para micro-organismos aeróbios mesófilos, Escherichia coli e Staphylococcus aureus. As contagens de micro-organismos psicrotróficos e colifiormes totais não possuem parâmetros legais, mas, utilizando-se o padrão para aeróbios mesófilos, também foram elevadas. Quando comparado a população microbiana do OIL nos dois tipos de armazenamento, a contaminação total e a de origem fecal foram mais elevadas em câmaras de resfriamento e em tanques de expansão, respectivamente.

In both conservation methods, there were initial counts above the limits established for mesophilic aerobes, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.

50|$|One {{benefit of}} {{rotational}} molding {{is the ability}} to experiment, particularly with wall thicknesses. Cost is entirely dependent on wall thickness, with thicker walls being costlier and more time consuming to produce. While the wall can have nearly any thickness, designers must remember that the thicker the wall, the more material and time will be required, increasing costs. In some cases, the plastics may significantly degrade due to extended periods at high temperature. Also, different materials have different thermal conductivity, meaning they require different times in the heating chamber and <b>cooling</b> <b>chamber.</b> Ideally, the part will be tested to use the minimum thickness required for the application. This minimum will then be established as a nominal thickness.|$|E
