25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{writings on}} the circulatory system {{are found in}} the Ebers Papyrus (16th century BCE), an ancient Egyptian medical papyrus containing over 700 prescriptions and remedies, both physical and spiritual. In the papyrus, it acknowledges the connection of the heart to the arteries. The Egyptians thought air <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>through</b> the mouth and into the lungs and heart. From the heart, the air travelled to every member through the arteries. Although this concept of the circulatory system is only partially correct, it represents one of the earliest accounts of scientific thought.|$|E
25|$|After {{nearly a}} decade of {{continuous}} success, most of the star players transferred abroad in the mid-1980s. Namely, Delibašiš, Varajić, Radovanović, Đogić along with coach Bogdan Tanjević who took over Juventus Caserta moved to foreign clubs. As a result, the club management decided to transfer members of its talented youth departmant to the senior team, along with bringing {{in a handful of}} new players from other Yugoslav clubs. Nenad Marković, Gordan Firić, Samir Avdić and others all <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>through</b> the youth ranks but their time in the club was cut short by the start of the Bosnian War.|$|E
25|$|Responding {{within three}} minutes to a {{dispatch}} call made at 10:15pm, seven police officers entered through the front entrance and moved toward the stage. Officer James Niggemeyer <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>through</b> the back door, behind the stage. Gale only saw the officers {{in front of the}} stage; he did not see Niggemeyer, who was armed with a 12 gauge Remington 870 shotgun. Niggemeyer approached Gale from {{the opposite side of the}} stage past a group of security guards, and saw Gale lift his gun to Brooks' head, and fired a single shot as Gale noticed him. Gale was struck in the face with eight of the nine buckshot pellets and killed instantly. Gale was found to have had 35 rounds of ammunition remaining.|$|E

25|$|Four {{explosion}}s {{were clearly}} detected. The fourth explosion {{was so strong}} that the stern of the Cuban ship was submerged and water <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>through</b> the hatchway of the engine room. At that time the hydrophones reported a sound similar to a liquid bubbling when it comes from a submerged container that is suddenly opened. The sounds indicated that the U-boat had been hit. To finish the U-boat off, the patrol boat launched two more depth charges, set to explode at 250 feet. A few minutes later, a dark stain was observed {{on the surface of the}} water. A spurt of a black and viscous substance smelling like gasoline came up from the deep. Although there was little doubt that the U-boat had been sunk, Delgado was ordered to take a sample of the contaminated seawater to confirm the victory. But even then it wasn't until after the war, when the Allies seized Germany's naval records, that proof of U-176s sinking was found. According to the seized documents, U-176 was under the command of Captain Lieutenant Reiner Dierksen, had sunk eleven enemy ships in her career, and was herself sunk with all hands lost.|$|E

500|$|This song {{transitions}} into Lennon's [...] "Sun King" [...] which, like [...] "Because", showcases Lennon, McCartney and Harrison's triple-tracked harmonies. Following it are Lennon's [...] "Mean Mr. Mustard" [...] (written {{during the}} Beatles' 1968 trip to India) and [...] "Polythene Pam". These in turn {{are followed by}} four McCartney songs, [...] "She <b>Came</b> <b>in</b> <b>Through</b> the Bathroom Window" [...] (written after a fan entered McCartney's residence via his bathroom window), [...] "Golden Slumbers" [...] (based on Thomas Dekker's 17th-century poem set to new music), [...] "Carry That Weight" [...] (reprising elements from [...] "You Never Give Me Your Money", and featuring chorus vocals from all four Beatles), and closing with [...] "The End".|$|E

500|$|The action resumed the {{following}} morning, with Howe closing on the French and then cutting through their line. Bellerophon followed Howe's flagship, the 100-gun , and sustained some damage from French fire. Howe isolated several French {{ships in the}} rear and pounded them with broadsides, but Villaret de Joyeuse {{was able to bring}} his van about to rescue them, and the two fleets parted again at night to reform their battle lines and repair damage. Poor weather on 30 May and 31 May prevented the fleets from making contact, but {{the following}} day, 1 June, Howe was able to bring about a decisive action, later known as the Glorious First of June. The British approached in line abreast, with Bellerophon {{at the end of the}} line. As they approached, the ships were heavily cannonaded by the French. Pasley was hit in the leg by a cannonball as he stood on the quarterdeck, with Midshipman Matthew Flinders reporting that [...] "our brave admiral lost his leg by an 18-pounder shot which <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>through</b> the barricadoes of the quarter-deck– it was in the heat of the action." [...] When two seamen expressed their sorrow, Pasley replied [...] "Thank you, but never mind my leg: take care of my flag." [...] He was taken below where the shattered leg was amputated. Captain Hope kept the ship in the engagement, pounding the 74-gun Éole until the French ship was forced out of the line. Bellerophon had by then lost all three topmasts, and her mainsail and lower shrouds had been cut to pieces. Hope then signalled the frigate [...] to tow the Bellerophon clear of the action. Despite being under heavy fire during the battle, Bellerophons casualties were comparatively light, amounting to four men killed and between twenty-seven and thirty wounded.|$|E
2500|$|On the Bee Gees' {{appearance}} on The Midnight Special in 1975, to promote Main Course, they sang [...] "To Love Somebody" [...] with Helen Reddy. Around the same time, the Bee Gees recorded three Beatles covers—"Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight", [...] "She <b>Came</b> <b>in</b> <b>Through</b> the Bathroom Window" [...] with Barry providing lead vocals, and [...] "Sun King" [...] with Maurice providing lead vocals, for the unsuccessful musical/documentary All This and World War II.|$|E
2500|$|During the sessions, the Beatles played many {{songs that}} were not {{featured}} in the film. Some would end up on Abbey Road ("I Want You (She's So Heavy)," [...] "She <b>Came</b> <b>in</b> <b>Through</b> the Bathroom Window"); others were destined for future albums by McCartney ("The Back Seat of My Car," [...] "Teddy Boy," [...] "Every Night"), Lennon ("Gimme Some Truth," [...] "Child of Nature" [...] – later reworked as [...] "Jealous Guy"), and Harrison ("All Things Must Pass," [...] "Isn't It a Pity"). The group also experimented with some of their previous songs ("Love Me Do," [...] "Help!," [...] "Lady Madonna," [...] "You Can't Do That") and played [...] "I Lost My Little Girl" [...] – {{which was the first}} song written by McCartney, when he was 14.|$|E
