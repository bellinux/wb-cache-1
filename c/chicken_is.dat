5|$|When being cooked, fried <b>chicken</b> <b>is</b> often {{divided into}} smaller pieces. The <b>chicken</b> <b>is</b> then {{generally}} {{covered in a}} batter, often consisting of ingredients such as eggs or milk, and a thickener such as flour. This is {{used to create a}} crust on the exterior of the meat. In addition, seasoning is often added at this stage. Once the <b>chicken</b> <b>is</b> ready to be cooked, it is placed in a deep fryer, frying pan or pressure cooker (depending on the method used) and fried in lard or a type of oil.|$|E
5|$|Fried chicken (also {{referred}} to as Southern fried chicken for the variant in the United States) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of <b>chicken</b> <b>is</b> that generally the <b>chicken</b> <b>is</b> cut at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made fried chicken.|$|E

According to the formula of y = − 0.023  × − 0.024 (R 2  =  0.994) (Fig.  5 c), we could calculate {{the concentration of}} lysozyme in serum.

The average numbers of H. gallinarum  originated from Asian and Europa were   9, 75 ± 12, 96 and 22, 43 ± 20, 45 worms respectively.   The defferences rate and intencity of infection in local <b>chickens</b> <b>were</b> inoculated with H. gallinarum from Asian and Europa indicated the difference of heritability of the worms...|$|R
5|$|There {{have been}} many known cases of {{population}} bottleneck in the recent past. Prior {{to the arrival of}} Europeans, North American prairies were habitat for millions of greater prairie chickens. In Illinois alone, their numbers plummeted from about 100 million birds in 1900 to about 50 birds in the 1990s. The declines in population resulted from hunting and habitat destruction, but the random consequence has been a loss of most of the species' genetic diversity. DNA analysis comparing birds from the mid century to birds in the 1990s documents a steep decline in the genetic variation in just in the latter few decades. Currently the greater prairie <b>chicken</b> <b>is</b> experiencing low reproductive success. However, bottleneck and genetic drift can lead to a genetic loss that increases fitness as seen in Ehrlichia.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), {{also called}} the white {{scavenger}} vulture or pharaoh's <b>chicken,</b> <b>is</b> a small Old World vulture and {{the only member of}} the genus Neophron. It is widely distributed; the Egyptian vulture is found from southwestern Europe and northern Africa to India. The contrasting underwing pattern and wedge-shaped tail make it distinctive in flight as it soars in thermals during the warmer parts of the day. Egyptian vultures feed mainly on carrion but are opportunistic and will prey on small mammals, birds, and reptiles. They also feed on the eggs of other birds, breaking larger ones by tossing a large pebble onto them. The use of tools is rare in birds and apart from the use of a pebble as a hammer, Egyptian vultures also use twigs to roll up wool for use in their nest. Egyptian vultures that breed in the temperate regions migrate south in winter while tropical populations are relatively sedentary. Populations of this species have declined in the 20th century and some island populations are endangered by hunting, accidental poisoning, and collision with power lines.|$|E

The {{purpose of the}} present study was to determine the presence of worm populations in intestine of chickens vaccinated and combined with egg yolk to experimental Ascaridia galli infection. Amount of 18 head <b>chickens</b> <b>were</b> devided into six groups (A – F). Group A, the <b>chickens</b> <b>were</b> not vaccinated. Group B, the <b>chickens</b> <b>were</b> vaccinated with excretory/secretory of A. galli L 3. Group C, the <b>chickens</b> <b>were</b> vaccinated with excretory/secretory of A. galli L 3, challenged with dose 1000 L 2, and treated ten times with 0, 875 mg egg yolk with an interval of one day intra orally. Group D, the <b>chickens</b> <b>were</b> vaccinated with excretory/secretory of A. galli L 3 and challenged with dose 1000 L 2. Group E, the <b>chickens</b> <b>were</b> challenged with dose 1000 L 2 and treated ten times with 0, 875 mg egg yolk with an interval of one day intra orally. Group E, the <b>chickens</b> <b>were</b> challenged with dose 1000 L 2. Intestinal worm burdens of infected groups were recorded. The result showed that excretory/secretory of A. galli L 3 combined with egg yolk decreased significantly A. galli survival in intestine of laying hens. Vaccinations were positively correlated with worm burden at 12 weeks after chalanged. The results suggest that A. galli L 3 excretory/secretory product contain potential antigen and that antibody-mediated mechanisms contribute to immune protection...|$|R

Although the chicken was domesticated in South-East Asia, archaeological evidence suggests that it was not kept as a livestock species until 400 BCE in the Levant. Prior to this, chickens had been associated with humans for thousands of years and kept for cock-fighting, rituals, and royal zoos, so they were not originally a prey species. The chicken was not a popular food in Europe until only one thousand years ago.|$|E
