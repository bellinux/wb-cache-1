In eusocial colonies, individuals may adjust their own efforts to maximize the productivity of the colony as a whole. Maximization of colony productivity can be achieved through sub-maximal individual performance. Attine leaf-cutter ant foragers often cut leaf fragments shorter than the hind legs could allow, suggesting other factors contribute to load size determination. Several studies have shown reasons why leaf-cutter ants <b>cut</b> smaller <b>loads</b> than they could maximally carry. The effects of wind speed on leaf-cutter load size selection were {{examined in this study}} and showed conditions in which leaf-cutter foragers change their behavior to <b>cut</b> larger <b>loads</b> than normal. In response to wind treatments, foragers <b>cut</b> larger leaf <b>loads</b> and fewer minima workers hitchhiked on those leaves. This study highlights behavioral plasticity of leaf-cutter foragers in response to local conditions on the foraging trail, and it adds to our knowledge of resource allocation in central-place foraging systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Recent {{work has}} {{suggested}} reducing electricity generation cost by cutting the {{peak to average ratio}} (PAR) without reducing {{the total amount}} of the loads. However, most of these proposals rely on consumer’s willingness to act. In this paper, we propose an approach to cut PAR explicitly from the supply side. The resulting <b>cut</b> <b>loads</b> are then distributed among consumers by the means of a multiunit auction which is done by an intelligent agent on behalf of the consumer. This approach is also in line with the future vision of the smart grid to have the demand side matched with the supply side. Experiments suggest that our approach reduces overall system cost and gives benefit to both consumers and the energy provider. I...|$|R

40|$|Intelligent {{software}} {{functions for}} energy management form a crucial element for aircraft electrical and thermal systems. In the electrical system, these are currently electrical load or power management functions that can <b>cut</b> and reconnect <b>loads</b> based on fixed priorities. The main aim of these functions {{is to prevent}} overload in failure mode of electrical generators, for example if one generator fails and another one has to take over its loads. For more-electric or all-electric aircraft, these functions should also <b>cut</b> <b>loads</b> during normal operation, since the electrical systems will not be sized to simultaneously provide maximum power to all loads. Additionally, energy management functions shall deal with multiple, parallel sources and should split power off-take {{in a way to}} reach maximum system efficiency. This paper provides an object-oriented tool and a method that enable a more intuitive development of an energy management function using economic models. They can deal with different criteria like efficiency and priorities while keeping computational effort low. For each load and each generator, a cost-over-power function is provided. A set of rules limit the characteristics of these functions. This enables a reliable and easy setup of the management function. This approach enables dynamic time-shifting of loads like galleys or environmental control systems (ECS) without defining fixed timetables in advance...|$|R

State-of-the-art vibration energy harvesting uses switching power electronics to synthesize compact conjugate matched loads allowing for maximum harvested power. Previous work demonstrating dual-frequency vibration energy harvesting used a piezoelectric <b>harvester</b> <b>loaded</b> with analog-controlled power electronics but was unable to cancel the parasitic output capacitance typical of piezoelectric harvesters at both frequencies. This thesis addresses the technical challenge of achieving maximum power transfer from multi-frequency vibration energy sources, simultaneously. Improved dual-frequency energy harvesting is demonstrated using a piezoelectric vibration energy <b>harvester</b> <b>loaded</b> with digitally-controlled power electronics. The digital controller - performing fixed-point computations - allows for synthesis of a band-limited negative capacitor needed to improve dual-frequency energy harvesting. by Felipe J Garza III.

The mill supply system is compound basically by the <b>cut,</b> <b>loading</b> and transportation operations (known as CLT).

In Campos dos Goytacazes, north of Rio de Janeiro state, the sugar cane activity is traditional and of great value, demanding continuous improvement of these operations. The aim of this work was to develop a simulation model to evaluate the relation of the CLT freight cost with the distance of the sugar cane supplier to the mill. Simulations of various ypothetical sceneries built to allow connecting the various suppliers concerning the paid freight were done. Results were validated with data from literature and with information furnish by local mills, allowing, and this way, to determine the impact of the freight over the direct operations costs of the CLT...|$|R
40|$|The {{consumption}} of electric power is increasing {{day by day}} without any control.

To avoid complete breakdown of power a new system is introduced by which power to individual consumers could be limited that helps the suppliers for controlling and distributing the generated power. The proposed system is fully automated and the main components used for the implementation of the system are an intelligent embedded system with the most modern AVR controller, a power line communication system and a set of Hall Effect sensors. The core logic behind the project is to monitor the current consumption at peak hours and to activate a breaker when the consumption increases beyond the limit value for that particular consumer. So in this way power consumption could be limited at peak hours and enables the distribution of available power according to the allowed deman...|$|R
