There are simple safety skills and understandings that can be easily incorporated into computer usage. Six hundred (600) questionnaires were personally administered to <b>computer</b> <b>operators</b> and other computer-users ranging from Students, Lecturers, Bankers, Civil Servants to Health Workers in the major cities of South- West of Nigeria. The result of the survey was analysed using SPSS and descriptive statistical techniques. The study shows that <b>computer</b> <b>operators</b> spend more hours working with computers than other computer-users. 83. 4 % of these <b>computer</b> <b>operators</b> spend more than 6 hours, working with computers at a stretch per day, very few (16. 6 %) observe breaks in-between. The study also reveals that RSIs are more prevalent among <b>computer</b> <b>operators</b> than other computer-users. Larger percentage of <b>computer</b> <b>operators</b> suffers some forms of RSI syndrome than other computer-users who rarely suffer more than one syndrome. Precautionary measures how these syndromes can be reduced are also highlighted in this study...|$|R

During Chuck Dixon's crossover series Nightwing: Hunt for Oracle, Barbara Gordon and Dinah Lance meet in person and establish a long-term friendship. They form {{the nucleus of the}} Birds of Prey organization. While Oracle serves as the basic head of operations, Black Canary becomes her full-time employee and field agent. In 2000, the first Batgirl monthly comic was launched with Cassandra Cain as the title character. Oracle appears as a supporting character throughout the series, acting as a mentor to the new Batgirl, alongside Batman. Gail Simone took over as writer of Birds of Prey with issue #56. In an interview, Simone explained her fondness for Barbara Gordon, stating: [...] "Kim Yale and John Ostrander picked up the character and made her into a brilliant master <b>computer</b> <b>operator</b> {{and one of the most}} fascinating characters in comics. From there, Chuck Dixon did wonderful things with her in his Birds of Prey run ... She’s fantastic because even just sitting in a chair in a dark room by herself, she’s tremendously compelling. The DCU without her would be a much less interesting place." [...] Simone integrates the Huntress into the comic, making her a central character in the series as Oracle's secondary field agent. In 2003, comic book authors Scott Beatty and Chuck Dixon revised Barbara Gordon’s origin with the miniseries [...] Gordon is a highly gifted child having graduated from high school early, but initially desires to join law enforcement as opposed to vigilantism in the previous origin myths.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Long {{hours of}} work at a {{computer}} can result in potential adverse effects such as pain, paraesthesia, and subjective weakness of upper extremities with associated decreased nerve conduction velocities of peripheral nerves (median and ulnar). Objective: To determine whether repetitive tasks performed for long hours by <b>computer</b> <b>operators</b> can lead to peripheral neuropathy as measured by nerve conduction studies of upper extremities. Material And METHODS: We performed nerve conduction tests on 50 <b>computer</b> <b>operators</b> in two study groups. Group I consisted of <b>computer</b> <b>operators</b> who worked a minimum of 6 hours per day at the computer while Group II worked a maximum of 2 hours per day. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between groups for most physical signs. In addition, {{there were significant differences}} between the groups for nerve conduction velocities of the medial (motor & sensory) and ulnar (motor & sensory) nerves. CONCLUSION: We found symptoms of pain, paraesthesia and subjective weaknesses as well as decreased conduction velocities of peripheral nerves in <b>computer</b> <b>operators</b> who work long hours. Further nerve conduction studies are needed to confirm predictive value for the development of carpal tunnel syndrome...|$|R

Aims To assess the prevalence and determinants of musculoskeletal pain in four occupational populations in Sri Lanka. Methods As part of the international Cultural and Psychosocial Influences on Disability study, samples of postal workers, sewing machinists, nurses and <b>computer</b> <b>operators</b> were interviewed about pain at each of six anatomical sites in the past month, and about possible physical and psychosocial risk factors. Associations with prevalent pain were assessed by binomial regression. Results Analysis was based on 852 participants (86 % response rate). Overall, the lower back {{was the most common}} site of pain, with 1 -month prevalence ranging from 12 % in <b>computer</b> <b>operators</b> to 30 % in nurses. Postal workers had the highest prevalence of shoulder pain (23 %), but pain in the wrist/hand was relatively uncommon in all four occupational groups (prevalence rates ranged from 8 % to 9 %). Low mood and tendency to somatize were consistently associated with pain at all six sites. After adjustment for psychosocial risk factors, there was a higher rate of low back pain in nurses and postal workers than in <b>computer</b> <b>operators,</b> a higher rate of shoulder pain in postal workers than in the other occupational populations, and a relatively low rate of knee pain in <b>computer</b> <b>operators.</b> Conclusions Rates of regional pain, especially at the wrist/hand, were lower than have been reported in Western countries. As elsewhere, pain was strongly associated with low mood and somatizing tendency. Differences in patterns of pain by occupation may reflect differences in physical activities...|$|R

Aims: To study the prevalence of asthenopia among <b>computer</b> <b>operators</b> and its association with various epidemiological factors. Settings and Design: Community-based cross-sectional study of 419 subjects who work on computer for varying period of time. Materials and Methods: Four hundred forty <b>computer</b> <b>operators</b> working in different institutes were selected randomly. Twenty-one did not participate in the study, making the nonresponse rate 4. 8 &#x 0025;. Rest of the subjects (n = 419) were asked to fill a pre-tested questionnaire, after obtaining their verbal consent. Other relevant information was obtained by personal interview and inspection of workstation. Statistical Analysis Used: Simple proportions and Chi-square test. Results: Among the 419 subjects studied, 194 (46. 3 &#x 0025;) suffered from asthenopia during or after work on computer. Marginally higher proportion of asthenopia was noted in females compared to males. Occurrence of asthenopia was significantly associated with age of starting use of computer, presence of refractive error, viewing distance, level of top of the computer screen with respect to eyes, use of antiglare screen and adjustment of contrast and brightness of monitor screen. Conclusions: Prevalence of asthenopia was noted to be quite high among <b>computer</b> <b>operators,</b> particularly in those who started its use at an early age.

40|$|Backgrand {{and aims}}   In recent years, {{computer}} application has been essential {{in nearly all}} kinds of job activities. Few jobs {{may be found in}} which computers are not applied. Studies have shown high rate of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) among <b>computer</b> <b>operators.</b> Since <b>computer</b> is used widely in banks, bank operators are considered as main users of computers in the workplace  and accordingly are encountered to the health hazards of working with computers. This study was  conducted with the aim of determination of MSDs prevalence among bank <b>computer</b> <b>operators.</b>   Methods   In this cross-sectional study, 287 randomly selected <b>computer</b> <b>operators</b> from 59 banks  of Shiraz city participated. Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) was used to study prevalence of MSDs.   Results   The results of NMQ revealed that the rates of MSDs prevalence in the past 12 months were 59. 6 % in shoulders, 58. 2 % in neck, 54. 7 % in upper back, 51. 2 % in lower back, 48. 8 % in wrists, 39. 4 % in knees, 31. 7 % in legs, 28. 9 % in elbows and 21. 6 % in thighs. Based on the results, the highest rates of MSDs prevalence were reported in shoulders, neck, upper back and lower back. Statistical analysis revealed significant association between job experience and prevalence  of MSDs in knees¡ thighs and legs (P< 0. 05). those was analysis also a significant association  between sex and prevalence of MSDs in shoulders, wrists and thighs (P< 0. 05).   Conclusion   MSDs, particularly upper limbs disorders and back problems, occurred in high rate  among bank <b>computer</b> <b>operators.</b> Regarding this, implementing interventional ergonomic  program in the bank workplace seems essential. Appropriate workstation design, increasing  operators' awareness of ergonomics principles in computer operation, job rotation and variation can be considered as parts of this interventional program...|$|R
