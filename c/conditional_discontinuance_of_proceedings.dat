40|$|Polish {{penal law}} {{provides}} pledge and surveillance of social institutions, organizations and. collective groups under which defendant or the sentenced person: works, receives an education or {{is in the}} military service. These measures can be of a litigious or probational character. The litigious pledge is a preventive means aiming at securing {{the appearance of the}} defendant at summons before the organs conducting the proceedings and preventing his obstruction of a process. It cannot be geared on resocializing the defendant as there is a principle of presumption of the accused's innocence hold valid in the penal proceedings, as long as a perpetration of a crime is not established in the final judgement starting upon a resocialization of the defendant will be untimely. The pledge as a probational means is aimed, on the other hand, at the resocialization. The litigious pledge is applied in the course of proceedings and for its duration unless it was limited to a certain stage of a process. It is terminated, at the latest by the final completion of proceedings while the pledge as a probational means is ruled at the <b>conditional</b> <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings,</b> conditional suspension of the enforcement of punishment and release on licence, it is undertaken for the time of testing a favorable behavior of perpetrator of a crime. A social organization, institution or a collective body which are undertaking a pledge have to appoint a person to perform the duties of a pledger directly. Surveillance is in principle a probational means. It can be applied as the litigious means of prevention only by the way of an exception, in case of stay of execution of a judgement pertinent to an extraordinary appeal against a valid judgement or a motion for instituting a trial de novo. A difference between the pledge and surveillance is not clear. The pledge is not limited itself to standing surety for the accused or the sentenced. It is related, as in the instance of the suryeillance, to the duties to control a conduct of the pledgee. Yet, the duties of surveilling person are regulated in a wider scope and more precisely. Theoreticians are advancing a proposition that a pledge is more flexible and less binding form of control. The pledge and surveillance are terminated upon the expiration of a probation period, earlier m the case of releasing a pledger from his duties and also in the instance of a final ruling of the enforcement of punishment or recalling a release on licence. The pledge expires also upon the reopening of conditionally discontinued proceedings. The social pledge — litigious and probational — is not often used in practice and so is the social surveillance performed by the social institutions and collective groups. Surveillance by court appointed curators (mostly social ones) is dominating.

40|$|Two {{directions}} of amending the Polish penal code are {{considered by the}} authoress to be the leading ones. The first one {{is characterized by the}} strife to diminish the represiveness of the Polish penal law. The second one comprises the proposals aiming at the increase of the law abidingness. When discussing the first trend, the authoress considers the multiple changes of the penal code regulations concerning a capital punishment, deprivation of liberty pecuniary penalty and the directives of determining a penalty. The elimination of capital punishment, or its limitation to cases of manslaughter and high treason is suggested. The lower limit of deprivation of liberty is decreased (to equal one month) as well as other sanctions related to individual crimes. Deprivation of liberty up to three years is to alternate, as a rule, with a penalty of restricted liberty and a pecuniary penalty (fine). The adoption of the socalled "Scandinavian system" in meting out fines in days is advised. Varying regulations are called for in questions of criminal responsiblity of juveniles and young adult offenders. The regulation of recidivism has to be essentially changed. The <b>conditional</b> <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> criminal <b>proceedings</b> is to be decided only in courts. The decrease in represiveness of penal law can also be effected by the new regulation of the conditional suspension of the enforcement of punishment and of the release on licence. The authoress advocates that the second trend of the proposed changes comprising postulates aiming at the increase of the law abidingness is out of proportion to the proposed amendments diminishing the represiveness of penal law. The scope of protection of criticism is not extended there and the grounds for the criminal responsibility of persons guilty of abuse of authority are not secured. The range of changes concerning protection against corruption and speculation is not satisfactory either. No coordination with the provisions of the Code of Offences and the Speculation Control Act can be observed. It seems also necessary to verify the obsolete part of the detailed provisions of the Penal Code. On the other hand, the extention of the smart money institution (paid by the perpetrator to the injured person) is to be classed among the changes of a right direction.

Being {{one part of}} divergences, the core <b>of</b> the <b>conditional</b> <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> criminal prosecution lays in temporally suspension of further criminal proceeding with a premise of its definitive suspension if the legal requirements are met. Except for the introductory part and the conclusion, the thesis {{is divided into three}} main chapters.

40|$|<b>Conditional</b> <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> {{criminal}} prosecution is an institute that was introduced into Czech {{criminal procedure law}} {{more than twenty years}} ago. Over the years, this alternative way of handling criminal cases has become the most commonly used (in the last four years, the second most commonly used) means of all alternative ways called diversions. This diversion is used by both prosecutors and courts in cases of less serious criminal offenses. The point <b>of</b> <b>conditional</b> <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> {{criminal prosecution}} is the decision of the prosecutor or the court not to initiate criminal court proceedings or cease them under certain conditions, the most important of them being the offender reimbursing the injured party for the damages caused by the crime. The goal of the author of this thesis is to briefly write about the history of alternative ways of handling criminal cases and their introduction into Czech criminal law, then to move on to specifically discussing the institute <b>of</b> <b>conditional</b> <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> criminal prosecution, the conditions that must be met for its use, the benefits it brings into Czech criminal law and criminal proceedings and to compare it with other types of diversions, {{as well as with the}} use of the same institute in Slovak criminal law under slightly different conditions.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is <b>conditional</b> <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> {{criminal}} prosecution. This institute {{is one of}} the alternative ways of handling the criminal case, which are collectively called diversions. Their theoretical basis is a concept called restorative justice. <b>Conditional</b> <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> criminal prosecution is an institute of criminal procedure that is a significant manifestation of the subsidiarity of criminal repression. This institute represents the provision of certain privileges to the accused that lie {{in the fact that the}} criminal proceedings are not brought to its standard end in exchange for reimbursing the relationship with the victim, disturbed by the criminal offence. The thesis is divided into six chapters, which seek to render the chosen theme as well as its broader context. At thebeginning, attention is paid to the concept of restorative justice and the concept of diversions. The main part of this thesis is in the third chapter and is entirely exclusively devoted to <b>conditional</b> <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> criminal prosecution. Author's goal is to cover all aspects of this concept and its application. The following chapter is devoted to other types of diversions.

5000|$|Among the {{specific}} changes to procedure that occurred {{as a result}} of enactment of the Judicature Acts was one impacting on the matter of [...] "abandonment of an action". Such an abandonment involves the <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> commenced in the High Court, typically emerging because a plaintiff is convinced that he will not succeed in a civil action. Prior to the 1875 Act, considerable latitude was allowed as to the time when a suitor might abandon his action, and yet preserve his right to bring another action on the same suit (see nonsuit); but since 1875 this right has been considerably curtailed, and a plaintiff who has delivered his reply (see pleading), and afterwards wishes to abandon his action, can generally obtain leave so to do only on condition of bringing no further proceedings in the matter.|$|R
40|$|The object hereof is the {{analysis}} of diversions in the Czech Criminal Law {{with a focus on}} conditional cessation of prosecution, which represents the most significant facultative alternative to the standard trial. The idea of procedural alternatives to traditional criminal procedure has become relevant in Czech legal system especially after 1989, when the ideas of restorative justice have begun to resonate also with the general public along with it new ways of decisions in criminal proceedings. Given that criminal policy is mainly controlled by the principles of restorative and retributive justice, it was necessary, in the introduction of this thesis, these two social movements define and analyse. In this sense was crucial to define the concept of diversion sufficiently, because is not legally handled, even defined. Using the deductive method was then possible to proceed to individual types of diversions and then to focus on the institute <b>of</b> <b>conditional</b> <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> criminal proceeding. For the purpose of comprehensive view of possible alternative procedures, the part of thesis was devoted to juvenile offenders, where special institutes and principles are applied.

40|$|The issue <b>of</b> <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> {{criminal}} prosecution in jurisprudence of Czech courts The <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> {{criminal prosecution}} is {{the institution of}} criminal procedure law, which is relatively widely used in criminal proceedings {{and it may be}} used at its different stages. This work is focused on current and controversial issues <b>of</b> interpretation <b>of</b> <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> criminal prosecution, part in light of obligatory reasons (generally defined in § 172 paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Code), part in light of facultative reasons <b>of</b> <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> criminal prosecution (§ 172 paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure).

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{principles}} of contemporary criminal law is the principle that criminal law is the “law of actus reus” (“deed of crime”). The main thesis of the paper is a statement {{that there is no}} reason to change that. As various forms of special crime prevention and their significance have been recently expanding, both in theory and practice, “the perpetrator’s criminal law” becomes of essential importance too. The fact that criminal law has always been the law dealing with actus reus (a deed of crime) is connected with the historical concept of repayment for damages. The penal suffering, or punishment inflicted, may be a re-payment for the deed of crime, but not for the identification of the perpetrator or placing the perpetrator in a certain category of perpetrators. Accordingly, the concept of mens rea (guilty mind) relates to actus reus (the deed of crime). The law of actus reus constitutes a certain bastion safeguarding against abuses on the part of the state, and therefore it is indirectly included in many constitutions through a requirement that a deed of crime must be defined, and through the principle of guilty mind as it arises from the principle of the state of law. The author asks whether the principle of a deed of crime (actus reus) is always adhered to by the German legislator. Consequently, the following are analysed: 1) the institution of an ineffective attempt, 2) a crime as an abstract exposure to danger of a legal good, 3) statutory attributes determining motivation to commit a forbidden act, 4) the so called principle of concurrence, or time coincidence in relation to the intention and guilt, 5) sentencing, particularly in case of persistent offenders, 6) <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> criminal <b>proceedings</b> arising from the opportunistic principle. The criticised solutions of the German law are being compared with selected provisions of the Polish criminal code...|$|R
