40|$|Abstract. Farm-level Census {{data and}} county-level income shock data reveal that past {{unexpected}} income shocks affect {{the rate of}} change in average farm size. Average farm size increases more quickly in counties experiencing negative income shocks as compared to counties experiencing positive income shocks. This result cannot be explained by perfect-market models, which predict farm size should adjust according to changes in the relative prices of labor and capital. We posit a model wherein cash flows affect liquidity, which in turn affects farm borrowing and capital costs. In the model, farms that do not face liquidity constraints benefit from negative income shocks because they reduce land values, so these farms expand while liquidity-constrained farms contract. Observed farm <b>consolidation</b> <b>patterns</b> and farm exit rates are consistent with a model wherein liquidity constraints affect small farms more than large farms...|$|R
50|$|The {{predecessor}} to the season's first designated {{tropical depression}} {{began as an}} area of persistent convection well removed from any landmasses. The JTWC began issuing products on the storm complex on October 21, noting recent <b>consolidation</b> <b>patterns</b> and its association with an ill-defined low-level circulation center. Over subsequent hours, the system developed a central region of convection with incipient rainbands. Despite these signs of potential tropical cyclogenesis {{in the very near}} future, the storm remained unclassified for several days as it tracked generally towards the west. At 1200 UTC on October 25, however, Météo-France classified the system as a tropical disturbance. Though upper-level atmospheric conditions were rather conducive for continued strengthening, factors including decreasing convergence and marginally sustainable sea surface temperatures were expected to inhibit tropical development, and as such initial forecasts only anticipated minimal and gradual strengthening.|$|R

40|$|The Brazilian Amazon {{is known}} for its {{ecological}} and social diversity, and its great economic potential. Human activities in this region have contributed to the intensification of deforestation where forest areas are replaced by other cover types and land uses as cattle ranching, mining, different types of agriculture, and logging. Thus, monitoring and analysis of forest landscape dynamics are important for land use planning aiming to sustainable use and environmental conservation. This study aims to identify and analyze patterns of deforestation associated to different types and trajectories of human occupation in the Amazon region using data mining techniques and landscape ecology metrics. This study uses data from Amazon Forest Monitoring by Satellite (PRODES) database. The analysis of deforestation patterns, associated to different forms of occupation and land use, contributes to add information to deforestation data and may subsidize studies involving environmental modeling, and land management and planning to support the development of public policies for the Amazon.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} lung abnormalities on serial thin-section computed tomographic (CT) scans {{in patients}} with {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) during acute and convalescent periods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serial thin-section CT scans in 30 patients (17 men, aged 42. 5 years ± 12. 2 [SD]) with SARS were reviewed by two radiologists together for predominant patterns of lung abnormalities: ground-glass opacities, ground-glass opacities with superimposed linear opacities, <b>consolidation,</b> reticular <b>pattern,</b> and mixed <b>pattern</b> (<b>consolidation,</b> ground-glass opacities, and reticular pattern). Scans were classified according to duration in weeks after symptom onset. Longitudinal changes of specific abnormalities were documented in 17 patients with serial scans obtained during 3 weeks. Each lung was divided into three zones; each zone was evaluated for percentage of lung involvement. Summation of scores from all six lung zones provided overall CT score (maximal CT score, 24). RESULTS: Median CT scores increased from 1 in the 1 st week to 12. 5 in the 2 nd week. Ground-glass opacities with or without smooth interlobular septal thickening and <b>consolidation</b> were predominant <b>patterns</b> found during the 1 st week. Ground-glass opacities with superimposed irregular reticular opacities, mixed pattern, and reticular opacities were noted from the 2 nd week and peaked at or after the 4 th week. After the 4 th week, 12 (55 %) of 22 patients had irregular linear opacities with or without associated ground-glass opacities and CT scores greater than 5; five of these patients had bronchial dilatation. When specific opacities were analyzed in 17 patients, consolidation generally resolved completely (n = 4) or to minimal residual opacities; six (55 %) of 11 patients with ground-glass opacities had substantial residual disease (CT scores > 5) on final scans. CONCLUSION: There is a temporal pattern of lung abnormalities at thin-section CT in SARS. Predominant findings at presentation are ground-glass opacities and consolidation. Reticulation is evident after the 2 nd week and persists in half of all patients evaluated after 4 weeks. Long-term follow-up is required to determine whether the reticulation represents irreversible fibrosis. © RSNA, 2004. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: The lung {{computed}} tomography (CT) features of acute chest syndrome (ACS) in {{sickle cell disease}} patients is not well described, and the diagnostic performance of bedside chest radiograph (CR) has not been tested. Our objectives were to describe CT features of ACS and evaluate the reproducibility and diagnostic performance of bedside CR. METHODS: We screened 127 consecutive patients during 166 ACS episodes and 145 CT scans (in 118 consecutive patients) {{were included in the}} study. RESULTS: Among the 145 CT scans, 139 (96 %) exhibited a new pulmonary opacity and 84 (58 %) exhibited at least one complete lung segment consolidation. Consolidations were predominant as compared with ground-glass opacities and atelectasis. Lung parenchyma was increasingly consolidated from apex to base; the right and left inferior lobes were almost always involved in patients with a new complete lung segment consolidation on CT scan (98 % and 95 % of cases, respectively). Patients with a new complete lung segment consolidation on CT scan had a more severe presentation and course as compared with others. The sensitivity of bedside CR for the diagnosis of ACS using CT as a reference was good (> 85 %), whereas the specificity was weak (< 60 %). CONCLUSIONS: ACS more frequently presented on CT as a <b>consolidation</b> <b>pattern,</b> predominating in lung bases. The reproducibility and diagnostic capacity of bedside CR were far from perfect. These findings may help improve the bedside imaging diagnosis of ACS...|$|E

Advances in virtualization hardware and software continue to improve resource isolation among consolidated workloads but a particular form of resource interference is yet to see a commercially widely adopted solution- the interference due to shared processor caches. Existing solutions for handling cache interference require new hardware features, extensive software changes, or reduce the achieved overall throughput. A crucial requirement for effective consolidation {{is to be able}} to predict the impact of cache interference among consolidated workloads. In this paper, we present a practical technique for predicting performance interference due to shared processor cache which works on current processor architectures and requires minimal software changes. While performance degradation can be empirically measured for a given placement of consolidated workloads, the number of possible placements grows exponentially with the number of workloads and actual measurement of degradation is thus not practical for every possible placement. Our technique predicts the degradation for any possible placement using only a linear number of measurements, and can be used to select the most efficient <b>consolidation</b> <b>pattern,</b> for required performance and resource constraints. An average prediction error of less than 4 % is achieved across a wide variety of benchmark workloads, using Xen VMM on Intel Core 2 Duo and Nehalem quad-core processor platforms. We also illustrate the usefulness of our prediction technique in realizing better workload placement decisions for given performance and resource cost objectives. 1...|$|E
40|$|Stanton, Mark E. Fetal alcohol {{spectrum}} disorders (FASDs) {{describes a}} continuum of birth defects caused by maternal intake of alcohol during pregnancy. In humans, developmental alcohol exposure impairs the normal development of many brain regions, including the hippocampus and frontal cortices (Fryer et al., 2007; Norman, Crocker, Mattson, & Riley, 2009; Norman et al., 2013). Importantly, the adverse effects of alcohol are largely {{a result of the}} timing, pattern and dosage of maternal ethanol consumption (Maier & West, 2001). In rat models of FASDs, the hippocampus, for example, is particularly vulnerable to damage when alcohol is administered during the neonatal period (Livy, Miller, Maier, & West, 2003; Marino, Aksenov, & Kelly, 2004; Tran & Kelly, 2003), which is equivalent to the brain growth spurt during the third-trimester of human pregnancy (Dobbing & Sands, 1979). The context preexposure facilitation effect (CPFE) is a hippocampus-dependent variant of contextual fear conditioning in which learning about the context (preexposure) and associating the context with shock (training) occur on separate occasions. This produces conditioned freezing during testing relative to a control group not preexposed to the conditioning context. Alcohol exposure from Postnatal Day (PD) 4 - 9 in the rat (equivalent to human third trimester) reveals a linear relationship between alcohol dose and spatial/contextual learning impairment in the CPFE (Murawski & Stanton, 2011). This dissertation further characterizes these neonatal alcohol-induced deficits in the CPFE. The purpose of the first group of experiments was to examine the effect of a range of alcohol doses administered during a narrower window, PD 7 - 9, than previously reported (Experiment 1) and to begin to determine which memory processes involved in this task are impaired by developmental alcohol (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, rats pups received a single day binge alcohol dose of 2. 75, 4. 00, 5. 25 g/kg/day or were sham-intubated (SI; Group SI) from PD 7 - 9. Conditioned freezing during CPFE testing on PD 33 was evident in all dosing groups, except for Group 5. 25 g. In Experiment 2, rat pups received either 5. 25 g/kg/day (Group EtOH) or were sham intubated over PD 7 - 9. During training on PD 32, rats remained in the conditioning context for 5 -min following immediate shock delivery, in which rats preexposed to the conditioning context showed comparable freezing levels, regardless of neonatal treatment (Group SI vs. Group EtOH). This suggests that alcohol impairs retention but not acquisition of the context-shock association and that context learning, consolidation, and retrieval is unaffected by alcohol treatment. Next, the novel object recognition (OR) and object location recognition (OL) paradigms were developed as a probe for examining the spatial learning processes affected by alcohol, without engaging the long-term consolidation, retrieval, and context-shock learning/retention components of the CPFE (Experiment 3). During testing in the OR task, a familiar object is replaced with a novel object. However, during testing in the OL task, a familiar object is placed in a novel location. In Experiment 4, we report no impairment in single-day novelty detection on PD 31 in either task for either Group EtOH or Group SI. This suggests contextual/spatial learning was not impaired by alcohol, in agreement with the results of Experiment 2. Lastly, Experiment 5 examined the impact of neonatal alcohol on Egr- 1 mRNA expression in the infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PL) subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the CA 1 region of dorsal hippocampus, and the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA), following the preexposure and training phases of the CPFE. Following context preexposure on PD 31, early-growth response gene 1 (Egr- 1) mRNA was elevated in both Group EtOH and Group SI compared to baseline control animals in all regions analyzed. Following both preexposure and training, Group EtOH displayed a significant decrease in mPFC Egr- 1 mRNA expression compared to Group SI. However, this dissociation was greatest after training. Training day decreases in Egr- 1 expression were not found in LA or CA 1 in Group EtOH compared to Group SI. These studies demonstrate that deficits in CPFE performance produced by PD 7 - 9 alcohol exposure likely reflect a failure to consolidate or retrieve a context-shock association, rather than a deficit in hippocampal conjunctive processes (context learning, <b>consolidation,</b> <b>pattern</b> completion) that occur prior to shock on the training day. Additionally, the alcohol-induced impairment of mPFC Egr- 1 mRNA expression during the context-shock association may contribute to these deficits. These findings illustrate the value of the CPFE for characterizing the separable memory processes that are impaired by neonatal alcohol exposure.

This study aims to propose an alternative indicator of infectivity in terms of prevention of disease transmission through selective isolation policy in children whose clinical condition is highly suggestive of tuberculosis. Material and Methods: This retrospective comparative study was performed on 95 children under 15 years of age diagnosed with tuberculosis based on both WHO criteria and positive sputum culture for mycobacterium Tuberculosis. The children were admitted for TB screening in the pediatric department of national research institute of tuberculosis and lung disease (NRITLD) between 2008 - 2012. Direct smear collected from sputum or gastric lavage, as well as HRCT were performed in all children prior to administration of medical therapy. Children were divided into 2 groups based on positive and negative smear results. HRCT abnormalities, as well as their anatomical distribution were compared between these 2 groups using multivariate analytic model. Results: The most prevalent abnormalities in the positive smear group were <b>consolidation,</b> tree-in-bud <b>pattern,</b> upper lobe nodular infiltration and cavitation. The negative smear group featured lymphadenopathy, consolidation, collapse and nodular infiltration in the upper lobe.

40|$|Continental glaciers covered {{as much as}} {{thirty percent}} of the present-day {{inhabited}} earth during the Quaternary period. Traditionally, one-dimensional consolidation has been considered as the main process of formation for the soils deposited during glaciation. One of the outcomes of accepting one-dimensional consolidation as the main process of formation is that the geomechanical properties of soil in a horizontal plane are isotropic (known as cross-anisotropy). Recent measurements of subglacial pore pressure and preconsolidation pressure profile have indicated that {{this might not be}} the case. The role of subglacial shear action has probably been long neglected. The main objective of this research is to investigate the effects of subglacial shearing on the geomechanical properties of glaciated soils. Recent research has found evidence of horizontal property anisotropy associated with the direction of the ice-sheet movement. A testing program was thus proposed to explore the relationship between the anisotropy of property and the direction of past glacier movement. The program involves several fundamental engineering parameters of soils. These parameters together with the corresponding test methods are as follows: (i) Conventional oedometer test – yield stress anisotropy; (ii) Oedometer test with lateral stress measurement – stiffness anisotropy; (iii) Load cell pressuremeter (LCPM) test – in situ stress anisotropy. The physical meaning of yield stress determined by conventional oedometer tests was interpreted as the critical state of structural collapse. The literature review and an experimental study on kaolin samples with a known stress history suggested that yield stress possesses certain dependency on the sampling direction. The anisotropy of yield stress for Battleford till from Birsay, Saskatchewan was also explored by testing directional oedometer samples. In addition, the anisotropy of stiffness was also investigated using a newly developed lateral stress oedometer that is capable of independent measurement of horizontal stresses at three different points with angles of 120 degrees. Preliminary evidence of a correlation between the direction of maximum stiffness in a horizontal plane and the known direction of glacial shear was observed. The correlation between the direction of maximum yield stress and known direction of glaciation was rather poor. Anisotropy of in situ stresses was investigated by conducting LCPM tests in Pot clay in the Netherlands. Based on the LCPM test results, it was concluded that the evidence of a correlation between the anisotropy of in situ stress and known direction of glacial advance is still rather obscure. Although both the laboratory studies and field studies cannot sufficiently confirm the existence of lateral anisotropy of geomechanical properties and its relationship to the direction of the Quaternary ice-sheet movement, the effects of subglacial shearing should not be neglected in assessing the geotechnical properties of glaciated soils. In practice, it is usually found that the preconsolidation pressure profile does not follow the gravitational line as predicted by the one-dimensional consolidation theory and its magnitude is not compatible with the measured effective pressure values {{at the base of the}} glacier. It has been suggested that changes in seepage gradient (upward or downward) are responsible for the deviation of preconsolidation pressure profile away from the gravitational line. In this thesis, a new glacial process model – consolidation coupled shearing – was proposed. This model is based on the framework of traditional soil mechanics (critical state theory, Modified Cam-clay model and one-dimensional consolidation theory) and is consistent with the general geological and glaciological evidences. This model may provide an alternative explanation for the preconsolidation pressure patterns generally observed in practice. It can also be combined with groundwater flow characteristics to explain the diversity of the preconsolidation <b>consolidation</b> <b>patterns.</b> The proposed model was used successfully to obtain the preconsolidation pressure profile observed in Battleford till at Birsay and the subglacial shear-softening phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: Tuberculosis is an {{important}} public health issue. The Brazilian government reported 78, 460 new cases in 1999. Miliary tuberculosis is a severe form of this disease. OBJECTIVE: To report on an uncommon clinical presentation of miliary tuberculosis in a child. CASE REPORT: A 5 -year old boy presented {{in the emergency room}} with fatigue and weight loss. He had had Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia 7 months before. Chest radiography revealed lobar <b>consolidation</b> and miliary <b>pattern</b> associated with small cavities in both upper lobes. Antibiotic therapy was started. The sputum was positive for acid-fast bacilli and hence the treatment recommended for tuberculosis (rifampicin, isoniazid [INH], pyrazinamide) was started. The patient was treated for 9 months {{and at the end of}} the follow-up period he had made a complete clinical recovery. CONCLUSION: Although in some particular cases sputum can be positive for acid-fast bacilli in children, limitations to the sputum test have forced pediatricians to base tuberculosis diagnosis on epidemiological data, clinical findings and radiographic pattern. In this particular case, we hypothesize that the sputum bacillus test was positive because bacilli grew inside residual pneumatoceles that were produced during previous pneumonia...|$|R
40|$|With the {{introduction}} of readily available technology, the subject of physical representations of mathematical concepts has become more of an issue for mathematics educators (Kaput, 1989). How technology {{is to be used}} for student learning may depend on the choice of representations inherent in the particular technological tools used. In discussing the idea of reflective abstraction and representations Steffe said: Our operationalization of reflective abstraction is compatible in its general outline with Kaput's (1988) view of how mathematical representational systems arebuilt in computer learning environments. (1989, p. 7) The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore one example of Kaput's model of multiple linked representation systems and how that example is compatible with constructivism. Kaput's Representational Systems James Kaput (1989) has stated that mathematical meaning-building can come from essentially four sources, grouped in two categories: Referential Extension Via translations between mathematical representation systems Via translations between mathematical representation systems and non-mathematical systems [...] .; <b>Consolidation</b> Via <b>pattern</b> and syntax learning through transformations within and operations on the notations of a particular representation system; Via mental entity building through reification of actions, procedures, and concepts into phenomenological objects which can serve as the basis for new actions, procedures, and concepts at a higher level of organization [...] . [i. e. ] reflective abstraction (p. 168) For the purposes of this paper, we will consider only the processes of translations between groups of mathematical representation systems. According to Kaput, the translations occur in two different areas (See figure 1), the mental world and the physical world. The mental world is the " [...] . essentially private world of mental events and state changes [...] . " 1989, p. 169) and the physical world is the " [...] . public world of characters and lines in some physical medium [...] . " (1989, p. 169). Both of these world views, as well as the correspondences between them, make up a representation system, and in this particular case, a mathematical representation system.

This article {{reviews the}} chest {{radiographic}} and CT findings {{in patients with}} presumed/laboratory-confirmed novel swine-origin influenza A (H 1 N 1) virus (S-OIV) infection. Materials and Methods. Of 222 patients with novel S-OIV (H 1 N 1) infection seen from May 2009 to July 2009, 66 patients (30 %) who underwent chest radiographs formed the study population. Group 1 patients (n = 14) required ICU admission and advanced mechanical ventilation, and group 2 (n = 52) did not. The initial radiographs were evaluated for the <b>pattern</b> (<b>consolidation,</b> ground-glass, nodules, and reticulation), distribution, and extent of abnormality. Chest CT scans (n = 15) were reviewed for the same findings and for pulmonary embolism (PE) when performed using IV contrast medium. Results. Group 1 patients were predominantly male with a higher mean age (43. 5 years versus 22. 1 years in group 2; p < 0. 001). The initial radiograph was abnormal in 28 of 66 (42 %) subjects. The predominant radiographic finding was patchy consolidation (14 / 28; 50 %) most commonly in the lower (20 / 28; 71 %) and central lung zones (20 / 28; 71 %). All group 1 patients had abnormal initial radiographs; extensive disease involving ≥ 3 lung zone...|$|R
40|$|Corridor (or belt) {{development}} and multi-polar patterns of urbanisation are long known {{features of the}} landscape. Corridor development {{is a form of}} urbanisation that, for a range of reasons such as mercha ndise, production, socio-economic and m ilitary/strategy, has occurred through the whole history of urbanisation. However it is a pressing topic in (Dutch) spatial planning and research. New technological developments in fields as transport, ICT and logistics plus the flexibilisation of labour, production and mobilisation this corresponds with, contribute strongly to the multi-polar network- or territory-city.
