The pygmy nuthatch is able to lower its body temperature when roosting, conserving energy through hypothermia and a lowered metabolic rate.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{grown as}} a hardy annual, lettuce is easily cultivated, {{although}} it requires relatively low temperatures {{to prevent it}} from flowering quickly. It can be plagued by numerous nutrient deficiencies, as well as insect and mammal pests, and fungal and bacterial diseases. L. sativa crosses easily within the species and with some other species within the Lactuca genus. Although this trait <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> to home gardeners who attempt to save seeds, biologists have used it to broaden the gene pool of cultivated lettuce varieties.|$|E
5|$|The loss of {{the weight}} of the gas taken from the {{cylinder}} makes the cylinder and diver more buoyant. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> if the diver is unable to remain neutrally buoyant {{towards the end of the}} dive because most of the gas has been breathed from the cylinder. The buoyancy change due to gas usage from back mounted cylinders is easily compensated by carrying sufficient diving weights to provide neutral buoyancy with empty cylinders at the end of a dive, and using the buoyancy compensator to neutralise the excess weight until the gas has been used.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> {{mathematical}} <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> that <b>is</b> {{amenable to}} being represented, analyzed, and possibly solved, with {{the methods of}} mathematics. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> real-world <b>problem,</b> such as computing the orbits of the planets in the solar system, or <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> of <b>a</b> more abstract nature, such as Hilbert's problems.It <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> referring {{to the nature of}} mathematics itself, such as Russell's Paradox.|$|R

5|$|Asexual {{organizations}} and other Internet resources {{play a key}} role in informing people about asexuality. The lack of research makes it difficult for doctors to understand the causation. Like with any sexual orientation, most people who are asexual are self-identified. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> when asexuality is mistaken for an intimacy or relationship problem or for other symptoms that do not define asexuality. There is also a significant population that either does not understand or does not believe in asexuality, which adds to the importance of these organizations to inform the general population; however, due to the lack of scientific fact on the subject, what these groups promote as information is often questioned.|$|E
5|$|Bacteriophages are {{viruses that}} infect {{bacteria}} and archaea. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses officially recognises 28 genera of bacteriophages {{that belong to}} 11 families. They are important in marine ecology: as the infected bacteria burst, carbon compounds are released back into the environment, which stimulates fresh organic growth. Bacteriophages are useful in scientific research because they are harmless to humans and can be studied easily. These viruses <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> in industries that produce food and drugs by fermentation and depend on healthy bacteria. Some bacterial infections are becoming difficult to control with antibiotics, {{so there is a}} growing interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat infections in humans.|$|E
5|$|In most species, the nymphs are herbivores or detritivores, {{feeding on}} algae, diatoms or detritus, {{but in a}} few species, they are predators of chironomid and other small insect larvae and nymphs. Nymphs of Povilla burrow into {{submerged}} wood and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for boat owners in Asia. Some are able to shift from one feeding group to another as they grow, thus enabling them to utilise a variety of food resources. They process a great quantity of organic matter as nymphs and transfer a lot of phosphates and nitrates to terrestrial environments when they emerge from the water, thus helping to remove pollutants from aqueous systems. Along with caddisfly larvae and gastropod molluscs, the grazing of mayfly nymphs has {{a significant impact on}} the primary producers, the plants and algae, on the bed of streams and rivers.|$|E
50|$|Corrosion of the {{insulators}} {{was found}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> in the harsh chemical environment as they gradually became conductive and the self-discharge rate increased. Dendritic-sodium growth <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|R

5|$|Men with SCI {{rank the}} ability to father {{children}} among their highest concerns relating to sexuality. Male fertility is reduced after SCI, due {{to a combination of}} problems with erections, ejaculation, and quality of the semen. As with other types of sexual response, ejaculation can be psychogenic or reflexogenic, and the level of injury affects a man's ability to experience each type. As many as 95% of men with SCI have problems with ejaculation (anejaculation), possibly due to impaired coordination of input from different parts of the nervous system. Erection, orgasm, and ejaculation can each occur independently, although {{the ability to}} ejaculate seems linked {{to the quality of the}} erection, and the ability to orgasm is linked to the ejaculation facility. Even men with complete injuries may be able to ejaculate, because other nerves involved in ejaculation can effect the response without input from the spinal cord. In general, the higher the level of injury, the more physical stimulation the man needs to ejaculate. Conversely, premature or spontaneous ejaculation <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for men with injuries at levels T12â€“L1. It can be severe enough that ejaculation is provoked by thinking a sexual thought, or for no reason at all, and is not accompanied by orgasm.|$|E

50|$|Another {{specialization}} {{problem may}} come as a result of security compartmentalization. An analytic team with unique access to a source may overemphasize that source's significance.

25|$|Freezes are an {{occasional}} occurrence in the Bartow area and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> if temperatures remain below freezing for a sustained period of time.

25|$|Odor {{pollution}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with old-style incinerators, but odors {{and dust}} are extremely well controlled in newer incineration plants. They receive and store the waste in an enclosed {{area with a}} negative pressure with the airflow being routed through the boiler which prevents unpleasant odors from escaping into the atmosphere. However, not all plants are implemented this way, resulting in inconveniences in the locality.|$|E
25|$|The outer {{shells of}} in-ear {{headphones}} {{are made up}} of a variety of materials, such as plastic, aluminum, ceramic and other metal alloys. Because in-ear headphones engage the ear canal, they can be prone to sliding out, and they block out much environmental noise. Lack of sound from the environment <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> when sound is a necessary cue for safety or other reasons, as when walking, driving, or riding near or in vehicular traffic.|$|E

25|$|Although insects <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> by far {{the biggest}} killer of {{carnivorous}} plants (besides human maltreatment) is grey mold (Botrytis cinerea). This thrives under warm, humid conditions and can be a real problem in winter. To some extent, temperate carnivorous plants can be protected from this pathogen by ensuring that they are kept cool and well ventilated in winter and that any dead leaves are removed promptly. If this fails, a fungicide is in order.|$|E
25|$|Malnutrition <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for cats fed non-conventional diets. Cats fed {{exclusively}} on raw, freshwater fish {{can develop a}} thiamine deficiency. Those fed {{exclusively on}} liver may develop vitamin A toxicity. Also, exclusively meat-based diets may contain excessive protein and phosphorus whilst being deficient in calcium, vitamin E, and microminerals such as copper, zinc, and potassium. Energy density must also be maintained relative to the other nutrients. When vegetable oil is used to maintain the energy balance cats may not find the food as palatable.|$|E
25|$|Habitat loss {{continues}} to be a major problem for the species. In northern Australia, much of the nesting habitat of the saltwater crocodile is susceptible to trampling by feral water buffalo, although buffalo eradication programs have now reduced this problem considerably. Even where large areas of suitable habitat remain, subtle habitat alterations <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> such as in the Andaman Islands, where freshwater areas, used for nesting, are being increasingly converted to human agriculture. After the commercial value of crocodile skins waned, perhaps the greatest immediate challenge to implementing conservation efforts has been the occasional danger the species can pose to humans, and the resulting negative view of the crocodile.|$|E

25|$|The {{manufacturing}} process itself has no unusual waste or byproducts, but {{getting rid of}} old bank vaults <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b> Newer, modular bank vaults can be moved if a bank closes or relocates. They can also be enlarged if the bank's needs change. Older bank vaults are quite difficult to demolish. If an old bank building is to be renovated for another use, in most cases a specialty contractor has to be called in to demolish the vault. A vault's demolition requires massive wrecking equipment and may take months of work at a large expense. At least one company in the United States refurbishes old vault doors that are then resold.|$|E
25|$|Atomix {{takes place}} on a playfield, {{consisting}} {{of a number of}} walls, with the atoms scattered throughout. The player is tasked with assembling a molecule from the atoms; more specifically, the atoms must be arranged into a specific shape, identical with the shape of the molecule displayed {{on the left side of}} the screen. The player can choose an atom and move it in any of the four cardinal directions; however, a moved atom keeps sliding in one direction until it hits a wall or another atom. Solving the puzzles requires strategic planning in moving the atoms, and on later levels with little free space, even finding room for the completed molecule <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b> Once the molecule is assembled, the player receives score; the faster the puzzle is completed, the more score is given.|$|E
25|$|While {{this method}} greatly {{improves}} {{the chances that}} an attack will be successful, it is not without problems. Exploits using this technique still must rely on some amount of luck that they will guess offsets on the stack that are within the NOP-sled region. An incorrect guess will usually result in the target program crashing and could alert the system administrator to the attacker's activities. Another {{problem is that the}} NOP-sled requires a much larger amount of memory in which to hold a NOP-sled large enough to be of any use. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> when the allocated size of the affected buffer is too small and the current depth of the stack is shallow (i.e. there is not much space {{from the end of the}} current stack frame to the start of the stack). Despite its problems, the NOP-sled is often the only method that will work for a given platform, environment, or situation; as such it is still an important technique.|$|E
