40|$|A {{diaphragm}} {{wall is a}} <b>cast</b> <b>in-situ</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> retaining wall applied in, among others, quay walls. The main advantages {{of this type of}} retaining wall are that it can be made in almost every preferred length and that it can resist high structural loads. However, there are several disadvantages: sufficient concrete cover on the reinforcement cannot be guaranteed and the wall has a low sustainability score because it requires a large quantity of building materials, which cannot be reused, and is difficult to remove. This study is done to improve the {{diaphragm wall}} design by applying prefabricated concrete elements that are connected by vertical prestressing. Research is done on the element dimensions and detailing, constructability, costs and the carbon footprint of the design option. The concept has been developed {{as an alternative to the}} quay wall in a reference project, namely the Euromax Terminal in the Port of Rotterdam. An optimized prefab element configuration is developed. The construction costs of the design option appear to be higher than those of the quay wall in the reference project, but the difference in costs reduces considerably when maintenance and removal costs are included in the analysis. The carbon footprints of the prefabricated wall and of the <b>cast</b> <b>in-situ</b> reference wall are almost equal. However, where there is a certain probability that a quay wall will be removed before it reaches the end of its technical lifetime, a prefabricated wall has a considerably better score than a <b>cast</b> <b>in-situ</b> wall; the prefab wall can be removed and its elements can be reused.

Although this problem is of national and international significance {{there are very few}} researchers or practitioners seeking to reconcile these opposing goals through innovative building design.

Indeed since 2015, clearing of Kwongkan has been prohibited under Australia’s Environmental & Biodiversity Conservation Act.

Research {{has shown that the}} thermal mass of the fabric {{can be used as a}} passive design strategy to reduce energy use for space conditioning. Concrete is a high density material, therefore said to have high thermal mass. Insulating concrete formwork (ICF) consists of <b>cast</b> <b>in-situ</b> <b>concrete</b> poured between two layers of insulation. ICF is generally perceived as a thermally lightweight construction, although previous field studies indicated that ICF shows evidence of heat storage effects. There is a need for accurate performance prediction when designing new buildings. This is challenging in particular when using advanced or new methods (such as ICF), that are not yet well researched. Building Performance Simulation (BPS) is often used to predict the thermal performance of buildings. Large discrepancies can occur in the simulation predictions provided by different BPS tools. In many cases assumptions embedded within the tools are outside of the modeller's control. At other times, users are required to make decisions on whether to rely on the default settings or to specify the input values and algorithms to be used in the simulation. This paper investigates the “modelling gap”, the impact of default settings and the implications of the various calculation algorithms on the results divergence in thermal mass simulation using different tools.

40|$|This project {{studies the}} dynamic {{response}} of a composite floor system to excitations from moving fork-lift trucks. The floor system analysed {{is a system}} of precast and partially prestressed double-tee elements with a cast in-situ topping. Currently, there are concerns whether the vibrations caused by fork-lift trucks might exceed acceptable limits due to an ongoing trend towards structures of higher slenderness. This study investigates the mechanical background of the excitation and the current design of the floor system. The study {{is divided into three}} major chapters: Dynamic fork-lift truck model A dynamic load model of a fork-lift truck is developed which can be used in the analytical verification of the vibration serviceability of structures. The model is based on tests performed on four fork-lift trucks in various configurations. The tests are analysed for the spectrum of accelerations. The analysis results in a simple two-degree-of-freedom model. Its only variables are velocity and time. All other values are constant throughout a simulation and depend on the geometry of the specific fork-lift truck and its payload. The frequencies and phase delays are constants and they are verified as eigen-frequencies of a three-degree-of-freedom model. FE-simulation of vibrations of a composite floor system The fork-lift truck model is applied to a three-dimensional model of a composite floor system. The finiteelement model is developed to simulate the construction process of the composite floor system and its influence on the in-service properties of the structure. As part of this work a preliminary investigation of the damping potential of the joint between precast and <b>cast</b> <b>in-situ</b> <b>concrete</b> is undertaken. A linear time-step analysis of the structure is performed and the nodal accelerations are analysed for their magnitude, dependence on the excitation and frequency content. Field test In order to verify the FE-model of the floor system and the results of the dynamic analysis a field test was undertaken: a floor system was monitored under service conditions. The field data comprise the accelerations of the floor and the forklift truck and the position of the truck relative to the points of measurement. A comparison of the field data and the simulation results proves the validity of both the dynamic fork-lift truck model and the FE-model of the floor system.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the vibration serviceability of long-span and slender in-situ concrete floors, which are typically post-tensioned. The motivation for the research is the present trend towards increased slenderness of post-tensioned floors supporting open-plan high- quality offices where vibration serviceability may easily become the governing design criterion. The vibration serviceability issue in post-tensioned floors is now also recognised by the UK Concrete Society which proposed, for the first time, guidelines for performing a vibration serviceability check when designing office floors. The guidelines were published in Concrete Society Technical Report 43 (CSTR 43) in 1994 and its publication prompted the initialisation of this research project. There were two reasons for this. Firstly, problems were reported with the reliability and practical application of these guidelines, and, secondly, the guidelines were not experimentally verified which is unusual for any design provision related to vibration serviceability. In order to improve understanding of the dynamic performance of a rather specific group of office floors which are long-span and made of <b>cast</b> <b>in-situ</b> <b>concrete,</b> a combined experimental and analytical approach has been adopted. A state-of-the-art facility comprising hardware and software suitable for field modal testing and dynamic response measurements of prototype floor structures was commissioned as a part of this research. The facility is built up around the instrumented sledge hammer, which served as the main excitation source in modal testing, and multi-degree-of-freedom vibration parameter estimation procedures utilising measured floor frequency response functions. The main testing programme consisted of modal testing of four prototype floor structures of varying complexity weighing between 13 and 1000 tonnes. All four slab structures were slender and made of in-situ concrete. These tests were complemented by measurements of the floors' acceleration responses to a single person walking excitation tuned to create as large as realistically possible responses. The modal testing experimental data (measured natural frequencies, mode shapes and modal damping ratios) were used to validate numerical finite element (FE) models representing each floor structure. To do this, advanced FE model correlation and manual updating procedures were employed. Results of these exercises highlighted a number of important issues related to the dynamic behaviour of the concrete floors investigated. Firstly, the bending stiffness of in-situ concrete columns and walls contributed significantly to overall floor bending stiffness and must be considered. Secondly, higher modes of vibration which are close to the fundamental frequency appear in concrete floors, and should not be neglected as they can be easily excited by walking leading to dynamic responses greater than those associated with the fundamental mode. Thirdly, the width of band beams contributes significantly to the lateral stiffness of post-tensioned floors, which, in turn, may be very beneficial for their vibration serviceability. The validated numerical FE models were then used to check the performance of three representative walking excitation models available in the literature. It was shown that, in general, all three models overestimated the measured response to the third harmonic of the walking excitation, which is particularly important for low-frequency office floors. Only one of the models did so in a way which is not overly conservative. This model is recommended for use in vibration serviceability assessment of post-tensioned floors. Finally, gross oversimplification of these important issues is identified as the principal reason for the failure of the current CSTR 43 vibration serviceability guidelines to predict reliably vibration response {{of a wide range of}} post-tensioned in-situ cast concrete floors...|$|E

40|$|To enable {{load-carrying}} in {{two directions}} in lattice girder systems, transverse reinforcement is needed. In the present study, the possibility to put transverse reinforcement in the precast concrete panels and complement with lapped reinforcement across the joints at the construction site was studied. The behaviour of such a joint, when subjected to bending, was investigated in two-dimensional finite element analyses. The analyses show that the cast joint between the precast <b>concrete</b> and the <b>in-situ</b> <b>cast</b> <b>concrete</b> is the weak link in this detailing, as could be expected. In the analyses where a rather large amount of transverse reinforcement was used, ø 8 s 150 NPs 700, the joint could be loaded close to yielding of the reinforcement; then opening of the cast joint occurred {{in all of the}} analyses. When no bent reinforcement, crossing the cast joint, is present, the failure mode will most likely become brittle. It is therefore recommended to have bent reinforcement crossing the cast joint. Two analyses were carried out with two different placement of bent reinforcement, ø 8 s 150 B 500 B in both cases. When the bent reinforcement was placed close to the joint, it obtained large stresses rather early in the analysis, and the analysis became unstable for rather low rotations. When the bent reinforcement was placed further away from the joint, the transverse reinforcement reached yielding, and the deformation capacity was approximately doubled compared to the other analyses. For small amounts of transverse reinforcement, or reinforcement with a lower yield strength, {{it might be possible to}} use the studied detailing even without bent reinforcement crossing the joint. In one analysis where the transverse reinforcement had a reduced yield strength, 500 MPa instead of 700 MPa, the reinforcement reached yielding, and it was possible to keep the yielding moment some additional rotation before the joint opened up. The modelling of the cast joint is of very large importance for the results of the analyses. The modelling of that was checked through analyses of joints between precast and <b>in-situ</b> <b>concrete</b> tested by Nissen et al. (1986), who made a large experimental investigation on the interaction between precast and <b>in-situ</b> <b>concrete.</b> Still some uncertainty about the input parameters remain.

The idea is that this residential quarter should be fully sustainable in ecological, economic and social terms. Since 2013, a number of pilot studies have been completed {{under the auspices of}} the Viva project framework thanks to financing from the Swedish Energy Agency. The various building frame alternatives that have been evaluated are precast concrete, <b>cast</b> <b>in-situ</b> <b>concrete</b> and solid wood, all proposed by leading commercial suppliers. The report includes a specific requirement for equivalent functions during the use phase of the building, B. An interpretation has been provided that investigates the building engineering aspects in detail, as well as an account of the results based on the social community requirements specified in Viva, durability, fire, noise and energy consumption in the Swedish National Board of Building, Planning and Housing building regulations (BBR), plus Riksbyggen’s own requirements, Sweden Green Building Council’s Environmental Building Gold (Miljöbyggnad Guld) and 100 -year life cycle. Given that the alternatives have different long-term characteristics (and also that our knowledge of these characteristics itself varies), these functional requirements have been addressed by setting up different scenarios in accordance with the EPD standard EN 15978. Because Riksbyggen has specified a requirement for a 100 -year life cycle, we have also opted for an analysis period of 100 years. The results show no significant differences between concrete and timber structures for the same functions during the life cycle, either for climate or for primary energy. The minor differences reported are accordingly less than the degree of uncertainty involved in the study. The available documentation on the composition of the relevant intumescent paint coating on solid wood frames differs from source to source, so it was not possible to fully allow for the significance of this. The LCA has not included functional changes in the building linked to load-bearing characteristics, noise, moisture, health or other problems that may result in increased maintenance and replacement. The concrete houses have been dimensioned for 100 years, for instance, in accordance with tried and tested standards and experience. The solid wood house is not dimensioned in the same way, and this has led to us having to assume various scenarios. The results also show the following:   • The uncertainties involved in comparing different structures and alternative solutions are very significant. The results are affected by factors such as life cycle, the functional requirements taken into consideration, transportation, design and structural details, etc.   • Variations in the built items and a considerable degree of uncertainty in the assumptions make it difficult to obtain significant results on comparisons. Only actual construction projects with known specific data, declared from a life cycle perspective that takes into account actual building developer requirements and involving different scenarios (best, documented and worst-case) for the user stage can currently be compared.   • In the other hand, comparisons restricted to different concrete structures only, or to different timber structures only, ought to involve a lower degree of uncertainty, These would then provide results that are significant as well as improvement requirements that are relevant.   • There is potential for improving concrete by imposing requirements on the material   • There is potential for improving solid wood frames by developing and guaranteeing well-documented long-term characteristics for all functional requirements.   The LCAs were performed as an iterative process where all parties were given the opportunity to submit their viewpoints and suggestions for changes during the course of the work. This helped ensure that all alternatives have been properly thought through. Because, during the project, Riksbyggen opted to procure a concrete frame, in the final stage the researchers involved focused on ensuring the procurement process would result in the concrete frame as built meeting the requirements set out above. As things currently stand, the material requirements for the concrete are limited by the production options open to the suppliers, and this is therefore being investigated in the manufacture of precast concrete frames for the Viva cooperative housing association. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{particular}} structural system for high-rise structures is discussed: the prefabricated concrete framed tube and tube-in-tube structures. These system {{consist of a}} prefabricated concrete perforated elements in {{the perimeter of the}} structure that are the main lateral load resisting elements in the building. For tube-in-tube structures, the perimeter elements work together with a structural core that also resists the high lateral loads that are due to the wind loading on high rise structures. The thesis starts with a literature study on multiple aspects that are associated with the subject. First, an introduction into prefabricated high-rise and framed tube structures is given and some key behaviors and elements of this kind of structures are explained, such as the shear lag effect and aspects of connections between prefabricated elements. Hereafter, previous research associated with the subject is described. Most of these titles are Master's Theses from Delft University of Technology, which is at the forefront for research on prefabricated concrete high-rise structures. Other references found are articles published in Asian countries or the United States of America, but those tend to focus on cast-in-place framed tube structures. Finally, sources describing the connection between elements are described, which is an important parameter in prefabricated concrete shear wall structures. The literature study continues with an analysis of prefabricated high-rise structures in the Netherlands. It presents different structures already constructed and their relevance to the subject of the thesis. Also a description of the Dutch high-rise market is given as well as the justification for the construction of high-rise towers in this market. The literature study leads to the section on the missing links in research and the research questions associated with these missing parts of information available in literature. As a result, the research part of the thesis is divided into three parts: - Shear lag effect of non-rectangular framed tube structures - Structural behavior of prefabricated framed tube structures - Case Study Zalmhaventoren: Potential of fully prefabricated tube-in-tube structures These missing links lead to two separate parts of this thesis. Firstly a parameter research was done to answer the research questions associated with the first two missing links. This parameter research tries to answer research questions such as: “How do framed tube structures without a rectangular floor plan behave with respect to shear lag?” and describes the relation between parameters such as aspect ratio, slenderness and corner stiffness on the shear lag effect and other structural aspects. It answers these questions by changing the parameters of a basic structure in the Finite Element Method (FEM) program AxisVM. This structure has a floor plan of 14. 4 m x 14. 4 m and has 25 floors with a 3. 5 m floor height, adding up to a total height of 87. 5 m and a slenderness just over 6. All models are made in 4 different configurations: a cast-in-place configuration, a prefabricated configuration with a masonry configuration for the elements and two similar prefabricated configurations with small and large windows. Two parameters are also formulated in this section {{to keep track of the}} shear lag effect: These are the shear lag factor P, for flange walls and the shear lag factor P* for web walls. All these previously mentioned characteristics, except for the floor plan, are used for the answering of the research question on non-rectangular structures. The conclusions from this part of the parameter research are that the changes in shear lag effect are small if inside corners or corners with an angle not being 90 degrees are used. For structures with the floor plan of higher polygons, such as octagons and hexadecagons improved structural behavior was found. The reduction in peak stresses in the corners can be attributed to the shorter elements where shear lag can form and the more corners over which the peak stresses can be divided. For the parameters researched using the square floor plan it was found that both the aspect ratio (the ratio between width and depth of the structure) and the introduction of structural vertical joints between the elements in masonry configuration had no to a negligible influence on the structural behavior. The effect of the corner stiffness on the structural behavior was more profound: especially reducing the corner stiffness has a noticeable negative effect on co-operation between the flange and webs walls, which in turn increases the deflection at the top of the structure. For the relation between the shear lag and the slenderness of the structure it was found that structures with a lower slenderness, that depend more on their shear stiffness to resist lateral loading, experience more shear lag than structures with a higher slenderness. In the second part the following research question was answered: “Is it possible to build a structurally feasible prefabricated tube-in-tube high-rise structure in the confines of the Dutch building market of approximately 200 m high and how does it compare to other prefabricated solutions?” In the literature report a building was described that could be used to answer both parts of this research question. The Zalmhaventoren is a proposed residential shear wall high-rise structure in Rotterdam which has been researched by ten Hagen for a Master's thesis at Delft University of Technology. In this thesis, the original <b>cast</b> <b>in-situ</b> <b>concrete</b> Zalmhaventoren is redesigned to a prefabricated shear wall structure that is 201. 3 m high. A redesign of this structure gives insight in the possibilities of a fully prefabricated concrete structure and has a model that as comparable to the model researched by ten Hagen. During the redesign the basic dimensions of the original structure were kept. The floor plan of the structure is 30 m x 29. 5 m, has a core of 14. 4 m x 12 m and the floor to floor height is 3. 05 m. Although originally designed as a residential structure, this floor height is also sufficient for other functions, such as an office function. To keep the structure comparable to the one designed by ten Hagen, 66 floors were used to reach the total height of 201. 3 m. Besides these basic dimensions however, significant changes were made to convert the structure into a prefabricated tube-in-tube structure. The removal of the shear walls and addition of the lateral load resisting façades changed the floor plan of the structure. To give the tube the stiffness that is required when loaded by wind, extra material was added in the corners of the structure, where windows were present in the shear wall design. Also an extra column was added in the center of the frame for the largest balcony on each side of the structure. In the lobby of the structure similar changes were made to fit the new structural system of the building. Another important part of the structural design was the determination of the stiffnesses of the different connections between the elements. Especially for the horizontal connections in the tube of the structure this proved difficult, because of the differences in normal stress between different parts in the same element. A 2 -level stepped stiffness was given to these tube elements to approximate the actual stiffnesses in this type of connections. For the corner connections (of the Interlocking Halfway Connection type) the stiffness was determined for the connection in compression and in tension. An iterative calculation ensured that the correct stiffness was attributed to the correct corner connection. After the model was made, the results were analyzed. Probably the most important result, for it is often governing in high-rise structures, is the deflection at the top of the structure. For a structure of this height, the maximum allowable deflection is 403 mm. For the four different wind directions, the deflection was between 282 mm and 327 mm. Also the shear stress between elements was checked and found to be within the limits set in the Eurocode. For two elements an estimation of the reinforcement was made. The reinforcement of the lintel was viable, but for the column near the lobby of the structure, a reinforcement percentage was found that was higher than the recommended maximum value in the Eurocode. However, if the integrity of the concrete can be assured or the less strict Dutch national annex is used, the found percentage does not interfere with the feasibility of the structure Along with the main model, some alternate models were made to research the effect of certain aspects on the most important result: the top deflection of the tower. The first one was the difference between a cast-in-place model and the prefabricated one. The increase in top deflection for the prefabricated structure was around 8 %. Not negligible, but not high enough to stop considering prefabricated tube-in-tube structures from being viable. The second check was if removing the balconies, and with them the less stiff frames around the balconies, and replacing them with ordinary stiffer windows had a positive effect on the top deflection. It was found that implementing this change at the same element thickness reduced the top deflection by 34 % to 42 %. Even when the thickness of all the elements was reduced from 400 mm to 300 mm, the top deflection of a structure without the balconies was better than for the model with balconies and a element thickness of 400 mm. In the comparison with the structure from the work of ten Hagen, it became clear that both lateral stability resisting systems could work for the Zalmhaventoren. Both had advantages and disadvantages that could be weighted either way by different developers if the structure was designed purely as a residential building. However, if the tower was designed as being a multipurpose building, the open floor plan of the tube-in-tube structure provides not only more flexibility at completion, but especially over the entire lifetime of the structure. Ultimately this research gives insight into the structural behavior of the prefabricated tube-in-tube structure and proved that the possibilities of the prefabricated tube-in-tube structure lie even beyond the 200 m, especially if the technologies associated with this stability system keep improving over the coming years.
