5|$|The {{community}} became wealthier and, {{following a}} royal provision by Queen Mary I in 1791, {{the inspector general}} Almada reorganized the town's layout, a new civic <b>center</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> monumental city hall, streets and infrastructure were built, all of which provided potential for a new business — sea baths.|$|E
5|$|About {{four hours}} after formation, the {{depression}} intensified into Tropical Storm Bret, upon which it attained a minimum central pressure of 1002mbar. Shortly thereafter, its appearance on radar deteriorated, and convection warmed around the <b>center.</b> <b>With</b> <b>a</b> mid-level anticyclone over Texas, Bret tracked steadily to the west-northwest, {{and began to}} re-organize just before moving ashore; at 12:00UTC on June 29, the storm made landfall just southeast of Tuxpan with winds of 65km/h (40mph). After crossing the coast, the storm quickly degenerated to tropical depression status, though Bret retained a well-organized cloud pattern with deep convection. The center turned to the north-northwest, and early on June 30 Bret dissipated inland over Mexico.|$|E
5|$|For the 2003–04 season, the Rockets {{moved into}} their new arena, the Toyota <b>Center,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> seating {{capacity}} of 18,500. During the 2007–08 NBA season where the team achieved a 22-game winning streak, the Rockets got their best numbers to date, averaging 17,379 spectators. These were exceeded once James Harden joined {{the team in}} 2013. The Rockets averaged 18,123 spectators during the 2013–14 season, selling out 39 out of the 41 home games. 2014–15 had even better numbers, with 40 sellouts and an average of 18,230 tickets sold.|$|E

5|$|Longyearbyen is {{the largest}} {{settlement}} on the archipelago, {{the seat of the}} governor and the only town to be incorporated. The town features a hospital, primary and secondary school, university, sports <b>center</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> swimming pool, library, culture center, cinema, bus transport, hotels, a bank, and several museums. The newspaper Svalbardposten is published weekly. Only {{a small fraction of the}} mining activity remains at Longyearbyen; instead, workers commute to Sveagruva (or Svea) where Store Norske operates a mine. Sveagruva is a dormitory town, with workers commuting from Longyearbyen weekly.|$|E
5|$|Metro Transit {{opened the}} A Line, Minneapolis–Saint Paul's first {{arterial}} {{bus rapid transit}} line, along Snelling Avenue and Ford Parkway. The A Line connects the Blue Line at 46th Street station to Rosedale <b>Center</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> connection at the Green Line Snelling Avenue station. The A Line {{is the first in}} a series of planned arterial bus rapid transit lines and is set to open in early 2016.|$|E
5|$|Although {{having the}} same floor plan, the House and Senate {{chambers}} are decorated very differently, with the former in terra cotta and teal colors and the latter in blue and gold. An oval cartouche in the carpet {{at the entrance to}} the House chamber features the state flower, the apple blossom. Presiding over the house is the speaker, whose chair is behind a desk in the <b>center</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> plaster and paint version of the state coat of arms. The Senate chamber is somewhat smaller than the House. The president of the Senate is the lieutenant governor, who presides over sessions from a walnut rostrum at the front of the chamber. Both the House and the Senate use computerized voting systems, including wall-mounted screens that allow visitors to follow the voting and both also contain glass tiled ceilings that allow natural light to shine through etched glass panels to better light the room. These ceiling tiles feature the coats-of-arms of each state in the United States.|$|E

5|$|For Thanksgiving 1988, {{his family}} spent the holiday with him, {{although}} he had developed neuropathy and was increasingly bed-ridden and reliant on morphine; he died in his bed on December 16, 1988 {{at the age of}} 41. Sylvester had planned his own funeral, insisting that he be dressed in a red kimono and placed in an open-top coffin for the mourners to see, with his friend Yvette Flunder doing his corpse's makeup. He wanted Tracy to sing at his funeral, accompanied by choirs and many flowers. The whole affair took place in his church, the Love <b>Center,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sermon being provided by Reverend Walter Hawkins. The event was packed, with standing room only, and the coffin was subsequently taken and buried at his family's plot in Inglewood Park Cemetery. An album titled Immortal was posthumously released; it contained Sylvester's final studio recordings, and was compiled by Marty Blecman.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{the city of}} Bellevue began {{studying}} a possible civic <b>center</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new city hall, courthouses, a jail, a museum and a basketball arena for the Seattle SuperSonics. The civic center plan was scaled back to a single convention center in downtown Bellevue, Meydenbauer Center, and a new downtown library, both of which opened in 1993; the plan for a city hall was seen as controversial and unnecessary at the time. In 1990, the city hall area was proposed {{as the site of}} a county jail and courthouse to serve the Eastside. The proposed site, located north of city hall, was seen as undesirable because of its existing wetlands and was rejected in favor of a site near Overlake Hospital Medical Center.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1930s, {{after the}} {{transfer}} of the Ukrainian capital from Kharkov to Kiev, a decision was made to demolish the cathedral and build administrative buildings in its place. For this purpose, in 1934 soviet authorities have decided to hold a competition for the project of the Governmental <b>Center</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> place for parades. In all of the projects submitted for the location in the area of Bogdan Khmelnitsky Square, the St. Michael's Golden-domed Cathedral was demolished, except for one. The project of Joseph Karakis {{was the only one of}} four projects submitted for the competition with the location of the center in this place, in which the St. Michael's Golden-domed Cathedral and the monument to Bogdan Khmelnitsky were preserved. However, at the end of the first round, the project of architect Peter Yurchenko was selected by the authorities as the most appropriate.|$|E

5|$|Nablus costume {{was of a}} {{distinctive}} style that employed colorful combinations of various fabrics. Due to its position as important trade <b>center</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> flourishing souk ("market"), in late 19th century, {{there was a large}} choice of fabrics available in the city, from Damascus and Aleppo silk to Manchester cottons and calicos. Similar in construction to the garments worn in the Galilee, both long and short Turkish style jackets were worn over the thob ("robe"). For daily wear, thobs were often made of white cotton or linen, with a preference for winged sleeves. In the summer, costumes often incorporated interwoven striped bands of red, green and yellow on the front and back, with appliqué and braidwork popularly decorating the qabbeh ("square chest piece").|$|E
5|$|On 6 August 2010, Wilders, who {{had become}} a regular guest with American conservatives and libertarians, {{announced}} that he would speak at a rally on 11 September in New York to protest the plans for Park51, a Muslim community <b>center</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> prayer space to be built near the World Trade Center site. The rally, to be held on the ten-year anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks, was organised by Stop Islamization of America, which was supported by former House speaker Newt Gingrich, who was originally announced as a speaker at the event, but never confirmed his appearance and cancelled a video appearance. According to SIOA's website world leaders, prominent politicians and 9/11 family members would be speaking at the rally, but Wilders was not mentioned by name, though he did attend as he had announced.|$|E
5|$|On March 18, 2015, Chabad Lubavitch {{purchased}} a building previously {{owned by the}} Ossining Heights United Methodist Church, on Campwoods Road {{in the village of}} Ossining. Chabad Lubavitch plans to renovate the building significantly before making it its first permanent synagogue. In June 2015, Saint Mary's Episcopal Church announced its plan to close on July 5, after 175 years in operation. A new community center was in development since as late as 2013. The part of the Briarcliff Manor Public Library building that formerly housed the library was renovated to serve as the community <b>center,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> completion date of 2016 and cost of $1,800,000. On December 12, 2015, the Law Park pavilion was damaged in a large fire described as arson; around 100 firefighters in multiple departments assisted to put out the fire that night. Damage to the structure was almost entirely confined to its upper level. The village government hired RGR Landscape to restore and improve the structure, reopening it on Memorial Day in 2017. Insurance covered the reconstruction, which retained the building's architectural style, and included a new concession area, an upper terrace with 280 donor-engraved bricks, bathrooms and walkways for ADA compliance, new lighting, and fire suppression and security systems. The village also planted new trees and shrubs replacing fire-damaged foliage.|$|E

5|$|Standing at 6 feet 11 {{inches tall}} (2.11 m) and {{weighing}} 250 pounds (113kg), Duncan was a power forward who could also play <b>center.</b> <b>With</b> <b>a</b> double-double career average in points and rebounds, {{he was considered}} one of the most consistent players in the NBA throughout his career. Regarded as one of the league's best interior defenders, Duncan also ranked consistently as one of the top scorers, rebounders and shot-blockers in the league. At the end of his final season in 2015–16, he was ranked first in regular season point-rebound double-doubles among active players, while he led the charts in post-season point-rebound double-doubles (158 as of 2013–14). His main weakness for much of his career was his free throw shooting, with a career average of less than 70%.|$|E
