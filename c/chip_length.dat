Milling experiments at various cutting speeds and chip lengths were performed, which resulted to different tool wear developments. To explain these results, a FEM simulation of the cutting process was conducted and the related chip geometries were predicted and compared to the corresponding experimental ones. Based on these results, the Coulomb friction coefficient between chip and tool rake was appropriately adjusted to achieve a sufficient correlation between experimental and computational data. By additional FEM calculations, the mechanical and thermal loads of the cutting edge were estimated and insight was provided concerning the effect of <b>chip</b> <b>length</b> on coated tool stresses and film fatigue fracture.

Conference theme - Innovative Systems Thinking: Unravelling Complexity for Successful Solutions. Titanium is used in aircrafts structures and engines. The materials’ low thermal conductivity and chip segmentation during machining cause a fluctuating heat load on the cutting edge. The extreme reactivity of titanium at elevated temperatures and its adhesive phenomena gives it the characteristic of being difficult-to- machine. The reduction of the <b>chip</b> contact <b>length</b> on the cutting tool edge will help to reduce the friction and thereby slow down tool wear. Various lubrication and cooling strategies were explored and evaluated {{in order to develop}} a new cooling technique that will be able to reduce the <b>chip</b> contact <b>length.</b> This will help to improve tool life and the surface integrity of the machined components. The tool wear was measured with an optical microscope in order to realize the performance of the different strategies. It was found that the high pressure cooling strategy showed to perform superior to the other strategies. Improved chip removal and reduced <b>chip</b> contact <b>length</b> with the cutting edge were found. Thereby, a new focused high pressure cooling cutting tool could be designed.

40|$|The {{method for}} {{determination}} of critical {{stress intensity factor}} based on <b>chip</b> segment <b>length</b> of <b>chip</b> type-I originating from orthogonal oblique cutting of beech wood (Fagus silvatica) in the 90 °- 0 ° direction is shown. Experimental cuts on 10 mm thick specimen with rake angles 31 ° and 42 ° were made, and the chip thickness varied between 0, 1 mm and 0, 3 mm. Using the ﬁnite element method, we modelled a representative chip segment of varying length and thicknesses. We varied the load at the chip segment and calculated, for each case, stress intensity at the crack tip and compressive stress in hypothetical chip. On presumption that the crack propagates during tissue separation only when the stress intensity at the crack tip equals the critical stress intensity and the compressive stress rises in chip formation process up to the limit strength, we can calculate the critical stress intensity factor by knowing the <b>chip</b> segment <b>length</b> and compressive strength in longitudinal direction. Speciﬁcally, the crack propagates until the compressive stress reaches the strength, which occurs at the place of chip break. Critical stress intensity factor calculated from representative 0. 3 mm thick <b>chip</b> segment <b>length</b> agrees well with values obtained with classical fracture tests. The results obtained from thinner chip segments deviates to a lesser extent, which is most probably a consequence of highly unsymmetrical specimen. The method has been undoubtedly shown as effective and reliable, {{which is the most}} important. The method is very simple and fast, enabling us to determine the fracture properties practically with a single oblique cut.

Using hybrid systems, which store excess energy from a diesel engine during periods of low loading for use during peak loading times, may yield higher energy efficiency compared to direct diesel-powered comminuting systems.
