40|$|A {{series of}} {{industrial}} powders, {{most of them}} organic, were characterized in terms of volumetric mean size, size distribution, density, particle shape, water rentention characteristics (under a series of controlled ambient relative humidities) and loosely packed and densely packed voidages (giving the compressibility). The behaviour of the powders in powder <b>handling</b> <b>apparatus</b> (a precision powder filler) was also determined. The minimum and maximum bulk densities of the powders {{were related to the}} properties of the individual particles by means of a semi-empirical equation. The filling capacity of the powder <b>handling</b> <b>apparatus</b> was found {{to be related to the}} maximum bulk density of the powder while the filling accuracy turned out to be related to the compressibility of the powder.

40|$|Background  The role {{of nickel}} in causing hand {{dermatitis}} in some occupations {{has been difficult}} to assess due to problems with reliable measurement of the exposure to nickel in the workplace and lack of a definitive threshold for nickel allergic contact dermatitis. It is not uncommon to find nickel allergy on patch testing {{but it is difficult to}} determine whether this is of relevance to occupational nickel exposure or simply a reflection of past exposure to nickel-plated jewellery or other nonoccupational nickel exposure. Objectives  To devise a simple and reproducible method to quantify the amount of nickel on the skin and to apply the technique to measure dermal nickel exposure in various occupational settings. Methods  A rapid and simple sampling procedure was developed for determination of nickel on the skin of workers potentially exposed to nickel by exposing individuals to nickel-releasing coins and measuring exposure by immersing the exposed thumbs and index fingers directly into graduated sample tubes containing ultrapure water and aqueous nickel extracts. The solutions were analysed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry after stabilization with nitric acid. The method shows advantages over alternatives such as wipe testing and tape stripping in terms of extraction efficiency, speed and ease of operation in the field. A pilot survey of dermal nickel exposure for workers in several occupational settings was conducted. Results  The study suggested that a ‘normal’ level of nickel on the skin is < 10 ng cm− 2. <b>Coin</b> <b>handling</b> induced an appreciable increase in the amount of nickel on the skin within 2 min. Experiments indicated a linear relationship between <b>coin</b> <b>handling</b> (exposure time) and measured dermal nickel levels following standardized <b>coin</b> <b>handling.</b> A pilot survey, conducted among cashiers, shop assistants, bar staff, hairdressers and workers in the nickel industry revealed dermal nickel concentrations ranging from < 0 · 9 to 7160 ng cm− 2. The levels of nickel on the skin of cashiers, shop assistants, bar staff and hairdressers were below the threshold level for water-soluble ionic nickel for occluded exposure at which 10...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} autonomous sorting of mov-ing coins via a robot as a multi-level {{task that}} supports the principled study of robotics fundamentals including kinematics, dynamics, perception, motion planning, controls, and optimiza-tion based around a widely obtainable, standardized, low-cost object (a coin). The paper also presents a demonstrated solution to this {{in the form of}} the CHARM (<b>Coin</b> <b>Handling</b> Arm for Robotics Mastery) robot, which addresses the autonomous coin sorting problem using an economical kit made from commodity computing hardware and three Dynamixel servomotors. From a learning perspective, this problem facilitates interdisciplinary practice across subject and grade levels with an algorithmic foundation that is central to modern robotics. Evidence sup-porting this approach is illustrated from case studies of student projects and, in particular, the CHARM robot. Beyond practice alone, by presenting a challenging (but manageable) research problem, we found that the coin sorting task teaches robotics in a principled way. Further, algorithmic complexity tiers the problem to academic levels. While motivated by robotics educa-tion, the (optimal) coin sorting problem may also be seen as an archetype problem for manipulation/motion-planning research. Thus, this also promotes a research foundation supporting later research opportunities. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of electrical conductivity using eddy current (electro magnetic induction) sensors {{is the most}} promising solution for validation of metal <b>coins</b> in <b>coin</b> <b>handling</b> devices, as the electrical conductivity is a very distinctive property of specific alloys. Low cost, simple and robust nature, and also possibility for high-speed precise measurements are the advantages of electromagnetic sensors. Multi-frequency scanning the coins under test at various field penetration depths is preferred due to the sophisticated "construction" of various alloys in nowadays coins. Air-core measurement coils have an additional advantage-a possibility to measure absolute values of conductivity without repetitive calibration of sensors and the measurement systems. Development of solutions for eddycurrent validation of metal coins has been investigated together with comparing the experimental results with the values derived from theoretical models. Frequency range of 10 kHz to 10 MHz have been considered (particularly up to 500 kHz for precision measurements) and conductivity values to be measured from 4 to 40 % of IACS (International Annealed Copper Standard) conductivity (about 60 MS/m). The results demonstrate that the precise, highspeed, low-cost and robust coin validation system can be developed {{on the basis of}} air-core coil arrays...|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, the <b>coin</b> <b>handling</b> aversion has {{resulted}} in the widespread practice of rounding payments. This is not technically a tip, and as such is not aimed primarily at the individual at the counter, but rather at the business. Nevertheless, if done with a smile it {{can be seen as a}} form of appreciation from the customer towards the clerk. Etiquette demands that one of the parties offers the change, but the other can choose to tell them to keep all or part of it. Small businesses may sometimes force the issue by just claiming they are out of change, or offering small value products instead, such as sticks of gum; this is considered rude and it is up to the customer to accept or call them out for it. The reverse can also happen, where the clerk does not have small change to make for the customer's paper money, but chooses to return a smaller paper denomination and round down in favor of the customer, in exchange for getting them through faster. The latter usually happens only in the larger store chains.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in the mid-2000s, the Federal Reserve {{consolidated}} its check-handling {{services as}} the number of paper checks fell rapidly in favor of check cards, debit cards and electronic bill payments.

50|$|Many casinos have {{eliminated}} {{the use of}} metal tokens (and coins) in their slot machines, in favor of paper receipts or pre-paid cards, which, while requiring heavy infrastructure costs to install, eliminate the <b>coin</b> <b>handling</b> expenses, jamming problems encountered in machines which took coins or tokens and can allow more game-specific technology {{in the space of}} a machine which would usually be dedicated to coin mechanisms. While some casinos (such as the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas) which installed the receipt system had kept the $1 tokens around for use as $1 chips, most other casinos using the receipts had simply scrapped the tokens entirely. Most casinos using receipts have automated machines at which customers may redeem receipts, eliminating the need for coin counting windows and decreasing labor costs.Casino chip collecting is a part of numismatics, more specifically as specialized exonumia collecting. This hobby has become increasingly popular with the Casino Chips & Gaming Tokens Collectors Club formed in 1988. Some collectors may value certain casino tokens up to $100,000, which are typically traded on online auction websites like eBay. Several casinos sell custom-made sets of chips and one or two decks of cards stamped with the name of the casino on them. Each set is contained in a small briefcase or box.|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, we have {{witnessed}} an exponential growth {{in the area of}} clinical diagnostic but surprisingly little has been done on the development of wearable chemo/bio-sensors in the field of sports science. In particular, the use of wearable wireless sensors capable of analysing sweat during physical exercise can provide access to new information sources {{that can be used to}} optimise and manage athletes’ performance. Lab-on-a-Chip technology provides a fascinating opportunity for the development of such wearable sensors. In this thesis two different colorimetric wearable microfluidic devices for real- time pH sensing were developed and used during athlete training activity. In one case a textile-based microfluidic platform employing cotton capillarity to drive sweat toward the pH sensitive area is presented that avoids the use of bulky fluid <b>handling</b> <b>apparatus,</b> i. e. pumps. The second case presents a wearable micro-fluidic device based on the use of pH responsive ionogels to obtain real-time sweat pH measurements through photo analysis of their colour variation. The thesis also presents the first example of sweat lactate sensing using an organic electrochemical transistor incorporating an ionogel as solid-state electrolyte. In this chapter, optimization of the lactate oxidase stability when dissolved in number of hydrated ionic liquids is investigated. Finally, a new fabrication protocol for paper-based microfluidic technology is presented, which may have important implications for future applications such as low-cost diagnostics and chemical sensing technologies...|$|R
40|$|The membrane-associated {{cytoskeleton}} of {{the cardiac}} muscle cell {{is emerging as}} {{an important element in}} the maintenance of normal cell functioning. Recently it was shown that when proteins (betaII-spectrin, muscle Lim-only protein, ankyrin-B, ankyrin-G) of this system are defective or deficient, cardiac malfunction ensues. It is well-established that the spectrin cytoskeleton is associated with the plasma membrane, but it was only lately demonstrated that its components also lie on internal cell membranes. This is particularly apparent in muscle cells of the heart which contain specialised intracellular membrane compartments particular to this cell type such as the sarcoplasmic reticulum and T-tubules. Cardiomyocytes are subjected to constant mechanical stress. Since their mechanics are controlled through coordination of calcium fluxes mediated via cell membrane-based assemblies, it is imperative that these essential elements withstand the displacement forces of contraction. Cardiomyocyte spectrin locates the multifunctional spectrin/actin-binding and membrane-binding component, protein 4. 1, and they act together on the plasma membrane as well as on internal membranes. We have found that cardiac protein 4. 1 links to the calcium <b>handling</b> <b>apparatus</b> whilst spectrins connect with the sarcomeric contractile elements of the cell. Overall this assembly fulfils roles in stabilising cardiomyocyte cell membranes and in coordinating the macromolecular protein accumulations which regulate and accomplish cardiac molecular crosstalk, whilst at the same time enabling the muscle cells to resist extreme forces of contraction...|$|R
