On the basis of an assessment of the implementation of this instrument, new possibilities could be considered in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaty, including giving further powers to the Eurojust national members, reinforcement of the powers of the College <b>of</b> <b>Eurojust</b> or the setting-up of a European Public Prosecutor”.|$|R

50|$|Eurojust was {{established}} {{as a result of}} a decision that the European Council of Tampere (15-16 October 1999) made to set up a permanent judicial co-operation unit in order to improve the fight against serious crime. The Treaty of Nice amended the Treaty on the European Union to include a reference to Eurojust. On 14 December 2000, a precursor organization called Pro-Eurojust was created by the Council of the European Union to permit prosecutors to test the Eurojust processes. It began operating in Brussels on 1 March 2001. The terrorist attacks in the U.S. in September of that year demonstrated strongly the need for international cooperation, speeding the development <b>of</b> <b>Eurojust,</b> which was then established in February 2002 by Council Decision 2002/187/JHA.

In the theoretical part the thesis focuses on historical development of extradition within the international judicial cooperation, explanation of basic terms and legal regulation of extradition. Development of extradition within the European Union is also described there {{and so is the}} comparison of extradition to European Arrest Warrant. The practical part is then dedicated to analysis of particular court decisions as an example how extradition and European Arrest Warrant work in practice...|$|R

40|$|First made {{available}} online on 12 January 2016. The {{development of the}} Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ) within the European Union (EU) has followed a remarkably capricious pattern. As a relatively new policy domain within the EU, it has been approached with caution and suspicion by politicians in the member States, who have implicitly or explicitly expressed resentment at relinquishing national control in sovereigntywsensitive areas, such as immigration and asylum control, police and judicial co-operation, and the fight against transnational organised crime, fraud and corruption. On the other hand, national politicians have embraced {{the construction of the}} AFSJ as an opportunity to turn the EU into a joint internal security enterprise which should bring the EU closer to the citizens of Europe. The latter approach has emerged particularly since the special Council Summit which was convened in Tampere during the Finnish Presidency and which was solely developed to Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) cooperation. The institutionalisation trend which was reinforced at the Tampere summit - particularly through the endorsement of the creation <b>of</b> <b>Eurojust</b> and the European Police College - has however been fettered by nested games and bargaining processes...|$|R

The first chapter deals with general information about judicial and police cooperation in criminal matters in the EU. It summarizes its history and discusses differences {{between the first and}} third pillar of the European Union and mentions the changes after adoption of the Lisbon Treaty which abolished the pillar structure. And thus communitarization of the third pillar has been made that has allowed deeper cooperation in criminal matters in the EU. Chapter Two describes Eurojust as a crucial institution of judicial cooperation in criminal matters in the EU. There is presented the history <b>of</b> <b>Eurojust,</b> its mission, tasks and organizational structure. The last part of this chapter is about the future of The European Union's Judicial Cooperation Unit, especially focuses on the possibility of establishing the European Public Prosecutor's Office from Eurojust.

40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the European Union enshrined in 67 alin. (1) (ex-art. 61 TCE and ex-art. 29 TUE) of the consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union is to create a common European space of security and justice without internal frontiers, in which to ensure the free movement of people, corralated with appropriate measures on external border controls, asylum, immigration, and crime prevention and combating. This is a long term goal that requires active cooperation of Member States and multiple efforts by EU institutions. The institutional functioning practice has shown that the clasic forms of judicial cooperation do not have the ability to complete this objective and that is necessary to create specialized structures. In this context the First European institutional structure was established in 2002, a specialized agency of the European Union, named Eurojust, with the main objective to promote and improve coordination and cooperation between the judicial authorities of the Member States in the fight against serious cross-border crime affecting the European Union. Tasks <b>of</b> <b>Eurojust</b> and relations with other European bodies, particularly the Council and Commission are established by Decision 2002 / 187 / JHA amended by Decision 2009 / 426 / JHA Council of 16 December 2008 It is exercised by College Eurojust or through its national members. ...|$|R
