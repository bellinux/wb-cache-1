40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the target was}} to explore the <b>cabin</b> air <b>conditioning</b> system and {{especially}} then fan solution. The fan motor is an electronically commutated (EC) motor. The idea is to clarify the harmonic phenomenon and how the EC-motors affect to the electricity quality. First it is convenient to introduce the electricity network of a passenger cruise ship and give {{a basic understanding of}} the components included in the network. There are both medium voltage and low voltage networks in the ship. The used electricity network is modified from a Mein Schiff –ship with little modifications so that the important key figures are not compromised. The EC-motor construction was introduced before the effects to ease the understanding why EC-motor produces harmonic currents and voltages which create harmonic distortion. The theory about harmonics is presented to the extent that is necessary for the the-sis; sources of harmonics, effects of harmonics and different solution for harmonic mitigation. After the electricity network and harmonics are presented {{the focus is on the}} information of the certain EC-motor type that is installed in the <b>cabin</b> air <b>conditioning</b> module. An active power factor correction unit is used in series with the EC-motor and the goal is to figure out if the power factor correction is needed in the system. This was done with both analyzing the theoretical side of the motor and then with practical measurements on the sea trial of the ship. The solution was that the power factor correction is not needed due the low harmonic currents and low electric power. This was also ensured by comparing total harmonic distortion measurements between the previous ship and the present ship because in the previous there was no power factor correction unit with the EC-motor. However the power factor correction improves the power factor almost by 0, 5 (0, 53 → 0, 99) which means also better energy efficiency. To decide whether the power factor correction unit is needed one must evaluate the cost of the installation and the cost of the electrical energy...|$|R

Air-conditioning in a transitional area should be considered to limit temperature difference to not more than 5 °C to decrease the unacceptability of temperature step-change. The linear relationship between thermal sensation and skin temperature or gradient of skin temperature does not apply in a step-change environment.

40|$|Air <b>conditioning</b> <b>cabin</b> of a {{transport}} truck {{is a new}} concept in India {{and has not been}} addressed. But in summer, the temperature in some parts of India is very high and results in unbearable cabin temperatures. In such conditions, an air cooled cabin for {{transport truck}} is a necessity. It is observed that much work has not been done in the field of cabin cooling of transport truck. The available options in heat generated cooling have been critically reviewed.

So, one of solutions to these problems are use Air Conditioning System (A/C) to reduce warm temperature in the <b>cabin.</b> Also, air <b>conditioning</b> can removes moisture in the windshield when driving in rainy. Cooling load calculation includes sensible heats from outdoor and latent heats from indoor. Sensible heats are heat transfers from sunlight through car body to interior cabin. Latent heats are heat transfers from passengers and air vent. Total of heat transfers will produce a total of heat in the car cabin. Then total of heat transfers converted into the power to determine Air Conditioning capacity.

40|$|Service vehicles, such as {{refrigerator}} {{trucks and}} tour buses, {{are equipped with}} auxiliary devices, including refrigeration systems and <b>cabin</b> air <b>conditioning</b> systems, which consume significant amount of energy. The engine of these vehicles should idle to supply power for auxiliary devices when they stop for a long time, e. g. for loading and unloading goods. This study proposes a new anti-idling system for service vehicles that powers auxiliary devices by a battery pack and an engine-driven generator (or alternator). In addition to idle elimination which is the main objective of all current anti-idling systems, the proposed system called Regenerative Auxiliary Power System (RAPS) attempts {{to reduce fuel consumption}} by enabling regenerative braking and utilizing an optimal power management system. The objectives of this study are to identify drive and service loads of a service vehicle for component sizing of the RAPS and to develop an optimal power management system for more fuel saving. In order to determine the size of required components (a battery pack and a generator) for the RAPS, drive and service loads of a given service vehicle should be identified. The drive load is the amount of power that is required for moving the vehicle, and the service load is the power consumption of the auxiliary devices. To identify drive and service loads, all the parameters in power balance equation of the engine should be either measured or estimated. As two inputs with unknown variations in this equation, vehicle mass and torque of auxiliary devices are required to be estimated. This study proposes a model-based algorithm that utilizes available signals in the CAN bus of the vehicle as well as a signal from a GPS receiver (road grade information) for simultaneous estimation of the vehicle mass and torque of auxiliary devices. The power management system of the RAPS should determine the split ratio of auxiliary power demand between the generator and battery in order to minimize fuel consumption. It should also guarantee that the battery has enough energy for powering auxiliary devices at all the engine-OFF stops. To meet these objectives, a two-level control system is proposed in this study. In the high-level control system, a fast dynamic programming (DP) technique which utilizes extracted features of the predicted drive and service loads obtains an SOC trajectory. In the low-level control system, a refined Adaptive Equivalent Fuel Consumption Minimization (A-ECMS) technique is employed to track the SOC trajectory obtained by the high-level control scheme. Many numerical simulations are carried out to test the functionality of the proposed identification algorithm and power management system. Moreover, the numerical simulations are validated by Hardware-In-The-Loop (HIL) simulations. The results show the idling is completely eliminated and a significant amount of fuel is saved by implementing the RAPS on a service vehicle. Therefore, the cost of energy can be noticeably reduced and consequently the cost of RAPS is recouped {{in a short period of}} time...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of aircraft in civil aviation {{has led to}} higher cruise flight altitude and Mach number. At the same time, economical and ecological requirements as well as comfort demands are increasing. This requires a new concept for the aircraft design, {{which may be the}} more electrical aircraft. In the proposed more electrical aircraft, all auxiliary systems are electric powered. This substitutes the pneumatic and hydraulic systems used in current aircrafts. The propulsion turbines of the next generation of aircraft will be designed for higher efficiency and durability. The bleed air outlets in a turbine decrease the efficiency and, by inducing vibrations on the blades, also significantly the durability of the engine. Moreover, the distribution of hydraulic fluid from the engine requires tubing throughout the aircraft, requiring fixed space and adding additional weight. Therefore, the increase in both efficiency and durability will be achieved by the electrification of the aircraft, which eliminates both bleed air and centralized hydraulic fluid distribution. In current aircraft, the bleed air is used partly to get compressed and warm air for the <b>cabin</b> air <b>conditioning.</b> In the next generation aircraft, the cabin air has to be provided by an air intake in combination with a compressor and an air conditioning system. The conventional centralized hydraulic system has to be replaced by electrical actuators or local hydraulic units. These components require also cooling air from the outside atmosphere, which has to be inducted by additional air intakes. Current civil transport aircraft commonly use NACA-type air intakes. The proposed new system design of the more electrical aircraft is characterized by the distribution of the consumers throughout the aircraft, which have to be cooled. This may require a wider variety of air intakes. Therefore a new design process including different types of air intakes has to be established. This work addresses the methods for the intake design process. One method to distinguish aerodynamic design methods is to categorize by the dimensions of the approach. One-dimensional approaches are most commonly used and combine streamline theory with empirical factors. They are used in preliminary design, as a relatively accurate estimation. In many cases, correction factors are used to extend the applicability of the method to describe the flow situation more realistically. Since empirical factors are used, the accuracy of these approaches is limited by the accuracy and portability of these factors usually obtained through experimental investigations. The objective of this work is to develop a method for preliminary air intake design. The focal point of the considerations is the intake design for supplying a compressor used in a civil transport aircraft at cruise flight condition at Mach 0. 82 and an altitude of 39000 ft. Different intake types are investigated in order to identify an optimal configuration in terms of high pressure recovery as well as for low additional drag force on the aircraft. The main objective of the design process of the air intake is to maximize the total pressure recovery from the free-stream air in order to minimize the required compressor power. The method for preliminary intake design is supposed to be one-dimensional and applicable to various intake types. The effects of varying boundary layer thickness, mass flow rate, and flight altitude are taken into account. Furthermore, parameters that specify the geometry of the air intake are evaluated with regard to optimal performance. The chosen method is implemented into a software tool, which allows the calculation of different air intakes and the comparison of those with regard to the requirements. This new calculation tool allows for prediction of intake performance in an early design stage. Dependencies between total pressure recovery, drag, and mass flow of the different intake types are investigated...|$|R
