5000|$|The art for the poster, shown above, {{was created}} by then {{illustrator}} now portrait painter, David R. Darrow, now living in San Jose, CA.

High-end digital compositing was too expensive at the time, so Darrow was further commissioned to create the new replacement label which was physically glued over the original illustration, preserving the original background and tomato characters.

When the shaft is eccentric in the seal, a Bernoulli effect low-pressure region occurs on the large-clearance side of the shaft.

This work extends the previous theory for short plain <b>centered</b> <b>seals</b> to large eccentricities using a perturbation analysis. Surface roughness effects are also included. An analysis of seals used in the Space Shuttle main engine hydrogen fuel turbopump indicates the desirability of plain seals over the labyrinth type. Experimental results confirm this...|$|R
40|$|Naval Special Warfare {{does not}} {{currently}} have a designated career path for an officer that requires professional military education (PME) for SEAL junior officers after {{the rank of}} Ensign (O- 1) and before the rank of Lieutenant Commander (O- 4). There currently is interest in this subject matter at the Naval Special Warfare Command and <b>Center.</b> <b>SEAL</b> officers increasingly hold key leadership positions and influence critical decisions in the execution of national strategy. This growing responsibility calls for a progressive and sequential education program to prepare junior officers for battle, staff, and command. Additionally, the Naval Special Warfare Officer corps {{will continue to grow}} in the coming years, adding more junior officers to the community. SEAL junior officers would benefit from structured PME throughout their careers. Through research analysis and a survey of Naval Special Warfare officers this thesis attempts to determine what education is critical for a SEAL junior officer. Additionally, this thesis attempts to determine {{the most efficient way to}} address education shortfalls and the frequency in which education should be experienced. Finally, the Naval Special Warfare junior officer community will benefit from education opportunities inserted into the officer career path to address nineteen specific subjects indicated in this research.
