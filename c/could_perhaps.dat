5|$|Although {{conclusive}} evidence might be wanting either way for whether Hebrew Law allowed for impalement, or just hanging, the Neo-Assyrian method of impalement {{as seen in}} the carvings <b>could,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> equally easily be seen as a form of hanging upon a pole, rather than focusing upon the stake's actual penetration of the body.|$|E
25|$|On Monday, 16 August 1731, Thomas Chambers' XI {{defeated}} the 2nd Duke of Richmond's XI at an unspecified venue in Chichester. The {{stake in this}} game was 100 guineas. No details are reported other than that Chambers' XI won. It seems that Chambers and his team all came from Middlesex so the match <b>could</b> <b>perhaps</b> be titled Sussex v Middlesex.|$|E
25|$|The biblical text {{does not}} {{explicitly}} depict {{the nature of}} the relationship between David and Jonathan. The traditional and mainstream religious interpretation of the relationship has been one of platonic love and an example of homosociality. Some later Medieval and Renaissance literature drew upon the story to underline strong personal friendships between men, some of which involved romantic love and <b>could</b> <b>perhaps</b> be described as romantic friendships.|$|E

Instead, jets of functions between two manifolds belong to a jet bundle.|$|E
25|$|Huainanzi translators {{proposed}} two hypotheses for {{the origins}} of ganying philosophy. Charles Le Blanc (1985: 143) asserts that the idea originated from musical resonance. John S. Major believes the ideas of Zou Yan (305-240 BCE), founder of the School of Yin-Yang, had a pervading influence on the Huainanzi, and suggests that the doctrine of qi and ganying resonance <b>could</b> <b>perhaps</b> {{be regarded as a}} genuine creation of the Zuo Yan school.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most of Australia, where {{exploration}} typically went inland {{from the}} sea, the Gippsland region was first explored and settled by Europeans who came overland from the Monaro region of New South Wales {{and headed down}} to the coastal regions. This <b>could</b> <b>perhaps</b> {{be seen as a}} natural expansion of the first settlements of Australia radiating out from Sydney, but to do so the settlers had to cross the not insignificant barrier of the Australian Alps.|$|E

25|$|The rectorate was {{an attempt}} to see {{something}} in the movement that had come to power, beyond all its failings and crudeness, that was much more far-reaching and that <b>could</b> <b>perhaps</b> one day bring a concentration on the Germans' Western historical essence. It will in no way be denied that at the time I believed in such possibilities and for that reason renounced the actual vocation of thinking in favor of being effective in an official capacity. In no way will what was caused by my own inadequacy in office be played down. But these points of view do not capture what is essential and what moved me to accept the rectorate.|$|E
25|$|New advancements in biotechnological {{experimental}} {{methods such as}} the use of Bessel beam plane illumination microscopy and FRET-based sensor molecules can better demonstrate dynamic structures of gap junction plaques. For these experiments, different types of AB5 toxins can be used to induce the fast formation of tCDR in E.Coli cells. The response can then be recorded using cAMP concentration fluctuations in gap junction-coupled cells using FRET-based sensor constructs. Research suggests that CDRs <b>could</b> <b>perhaps</b> be linked with rapid rearrangement of lipids and protein in connexin channels within the gap junction plaques. This can further help us understand the signaling cascade that follows a cellular loss of K+ when exposed to bacterial infection.|$|E
25|$|The first {{settlement}} at Phylakopi (Greek Φυλακωπή) {{arose in}} the Bronze Age, flourishing as the extraction of obsidian was in the decline. The first settlers were tuna fishermen. Lying on the north-east coast, excavations by the British School of Archeology revealed a town wall and a Minoan-inspired structure, dubbed the Pillar room, which contained fragments of vivid wall paintings. The famous fresco of the flying fish {{was found in the}} ruins of the Pillar room and was executed with delicate colouring and graphic observation of nature in the graceful movement of a fish. Stylistic similarities to Minoan frescoes are suggested, and it <b>could</b> <b>perhaps</b> have been the work of a Cretan artist. Part of the site has been washed away by the sea.|$|E

25|$|Boeing later won {{the contest}} against Airbus (Northrop having withdrawn) and US Aerospace/Antonov (disqualified), {{with a lower}} price, on February 24, 2011. The price was so low some in the media believe Boeing would take a loss on the deal; they also speculated that the company <b>could</b> <b>perhaps</b> break even with {{maintenance}} and spare parts contracts. In July 2011, {{it was revealed that}} projected development costs rose $1.4bn and will exceed the $4.9bn contract cap by $300m. For the first $1bn increase (from the award price to the cap), the U.S. government would be responsible for $600m under a 60/40 government/Boeing split. With Boeing being wholly responsible for the additional $300m ceiling breach, Boeing would be responsible for a total of $700m of the additional cost.|$|E
25|$|It {{seems to}} be one of the {{fundamental}} features of nature that fundamental physical laws are described in terms of a mathematical theory of great beauty and power, needing quite a high standard of mathematics for one to understand it. You may wonder: Why is nature constructed along these lines? One can only answer that our present knowledge seems to show that nature is so constructed. We simply have to accept it. One <b>could</b> <b>perhaps</b> describe the situation by saying that God is a mathematician of a very high order, and He used very advanced mathematics in constructing the universe. Our feeble attempts at mathematics enable us to understand a bit of the universe, and as we proceed to develop higher and higher mathematics we can hope to understand the universe better.|$|E
25|$|Navigation had an {{important}} role: historian Pierluigi Montalbano mentions the finding of nuragic anchors along the coast, some weighing 100kg. This {{has suggested that the}} Nuragic people used efficient ships, which <b>could</b> <b>perhaps</b> reach lengths up to 15 meters. These allowed them to travel the whole Mediterranean, establishing commercial links with the Mycenaean civilization (attested by the common tholos tomb shape, and the adoration of bulls), Spain, Italy, Cyprus, Lebanon. Items such as Cyprus-type copper ingots have been found in Sardinia, while bronze and early Iron Age Nuragic ceramics have been found in the Aegean region, in Spain (Huelva, Tarragona, Málaga, Teruel and Cádiz) up to the Gibraltar strait, and in Etruscan centers of the Italian peninsula such as Vetulonia, Vulci and Populonia (known in the 9th to 6th centuries from Nuragic statues found in their tombs).|$|E

25|$|The {{ability to}} raise more conscripts {{depended}} greatly on the High King’s grip over his vassals. Bayinnaung required newly conquered states to provide their quota of manpower for the next campaign. According to scholarship, {{at the peak of}} the empire, the imperial army <b>could</b> <b>perhaps</b> raise about 100,000 troops, and the largest initial troop level for a single campaign was about 70,000. A major weakness of the system was that the vast majority of the potential levy hailed from outside the capital region. In 1581, only 21% of residents within a 200-km radius of Pegu were ahmudans (whereas in 1650 in the Restored Toungoo period, over 40% of the ahmudans were within 200km of the capital Ava). It meant that the High King of the First Toungoo period needed to rely far more on his vassal rulers to raise the troops. The weakness was brutally exposed when the High King was not Bayinnaung. Nanda's troops most probably never totalled more than 25,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{writings}} of Antonio Gramsci and Herbert Marcuse were drawn upon. Gramsci wrote on power, cultural and ideological conflicts {{in society and}} institutions—real-time class struggles playing out in rapidly developing industrial nation states through interlinked areas of political behavior, Marcuse on coercion and hegemony in that cultural indoctrination and ideological manipulation through the means of communication ("repressive tolerance") dispensed {{with the need for}} complete brute force in modern 'liberal democracies'. His One-Dimensional Man was addressed to the restive students of the sixties. Marcuse argued that only marginal groups of students and poor alienated workers could effectively resist the system. Both Gramsci and Marcuse {{came to the conclusion that}} the ideological underpinnings and the 'superstructure' of society was vitally important in the understanding of class control (and acquiescence). This <b>could</b> <b>perhaps</b> be seen as an extension of Marx's work as he did not cover this area in detail. Das Kapital, his mainly economic work, was meant to be one of a series of books which would have included one on society and one on the state, but his death prevented fulfilment of this.|$|E
25|$|Homosexuality: Disease or Way of Life? is a 1956 book by the {{psychoanalyst}} Edmund Bergler, {{in which}} the author argues that homosexuality is a curable illness. Bergler denies that homosexuality is caused by hormonal or other biological factors, the Oedipus complex, or having a dominant mother and a weak or absent father, instead attributing {{both male and female}} homosexuality to pre-Oedipal factors involving an unsolved masochistic conflict with the mother during the earliest period of infancy. According to Bergler, homosexuality in men reflects unconscious fear and hatred of women. Bergler argues that there are several different types of homosexuality, each with a distinct clinical profile. Bergler rejects the existence of bisexuality, maintaining that all supposed bisexuals are homosexuals, and criticizes the work of sex researcher Alfred Kinsey. He characterizes homosexual men as sexually promiscuous, and argues that this promiscuity is a result of their unsatisfying sex lives and masochistic craving for danger. Bergler argues against immediately repealing laws against homosexuality, though he suggests that such laws <b>could</b> <b>perhaps</b> be repealed in the future if other measures against homosexuality proved effective. Bergler proposes the publicizing of his ideas as a measure against homosexuality.|$|E

25|$|The {{disease is}} caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. It often occurs in close {{proximity}} to water bodies, but no specific activities that bring people into contact with water have been identified (i.e. fetching of water, fishing, rice farming, washing, bathing, etc.). The mode of transmission of Buruli ulcer is not entirely known. Recent evidence suggests insects may be involved in the transmission of the infection. These insects are aquatic bugs belonging to the genus Naucoris (family Naucoridae) and Diplonychus (family Belostomatidae). Trauma is probably the most frequent means by which M. ulcerans is introduced into the skin from surface contamination. The initial trauma can be a mild skin wound such as scratch or as severe. Other studies have suggested aerosol spread but these are not proven. In Australia, animals such as koalas and possums are naturally infected. Epidemiological evidence has not clearly supported person-to-person transmission. However, Muelder & Nourou found that 10 out of 28 patients had relatives who had also had the disease, and cautioned against the dismissal of person-to-person transmission. Given the number of patients who shed large numbers of bacilli from their wounds and live in very close contact with relatives, more cases should have been observed. The cases reported by Muelder & Nourou <b>could</b> <b>perhaps</b> have been exposed to a common source of infection, and there might also be genetic component to sensitivity to the disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{participants}} received a life ban from Caribbean cricket in 1983. In many instances, they were ostracised socially and professionally, {{such was the}} hostility toward players that complied with the South African apartheid system. In contrast, the players commented on a warm reception from both blacks and whites in South Africa and the tour {{may have been a}} positive influence on relations between races. It {{was one of the few}} occasions when white and black people had played sport together in South Africa. The players' bans were lifted in 1989 (although Lynch appeared in ODI's for England a year earlier against the touring West Indians) but the only tour member who played for West Indies again was Moseley, at the age of 32 (two tests in the 1989-90 home series against England: though he did not take many wickets, his appearance was chiefly notable for breaking Graham Gooch's hand, forcing Gooch - now England's captain - to miss the remainder of the series). Stephenson and Clarke had very successful first-class careers in South African and English domestic cricket: and Stephenson in particular <b>could</b> <b>perhaps</b> be thought unlucky not to be given a chance in Test cricket, given the precedent set by Moseley's selection and the fact that his performances in the English county championship had been nothing short of spectacular.|$|E
