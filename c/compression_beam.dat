40|$|AbstractRecent {{research}} has established {{the effectiveness of}} sandwich structures with metallic cellular cores for blast mitigation. The choice of core architecture can enhance sandwich performance, dissipating energy through plastic core compression and exploiting fluid–structure interaction effects to reduce the momentum imparted to the structure by the blast. In this paper we describe the first analysis of a novel sandwich core concept for blast mitigation: the stacked folded core. The core consists of an alternating stacked sequence of folded sheets in the Miura (double-corrugated) pattern, with the stack oriented such that the folding kinematics define the out-of plane compressive strength of the core. It offers a number of distinct characteristics compared to existing cellular cores. (i) The kinematics of collapse of the core by a distinctive folding mechanism give it unique mechanical properties, including strong anisotropy. (ii) The fold pattern and stacking arrangement is extremely versatile, offering exceptional freedom to tailor the mechanical properties of the core. This includes freedom to grade the core properties through progressive changes in the fold pattern. (iii) Continuous manufacturing processes have been established for the Miura folded sheets which make up the core. The design is therefore potentially more straightforward and economical to manufacture than other metallic cellular materials. In this first investigation of the stacked folded core, finite element analysis is used to investigate its characteristics under both quasi-static and dynamic loading. A dynamic analysis of an impulsively loaded sandwich beam with a stacked folded core reveals the versatility of the concept for blast mitigation. By altering the fold pattern alone, the durations of key phases of the dynamic sandwich response (core <b>compression,</b> <b>beam</b> bending) can be controlled. By altering both fold pattern and sheet thickness in the core, the same is achieved without altering {{the density of the}} core or the mass distribution of the sandwich beam...|$|E
40|$|We are {{becoming}} dependent on energy more today {{than we were}} a century ago, and with increasing world population and booming economies, sooner or later our energy sources will be exhausted. Moreover, our economy and welfare strongly depends on foreign oil and {{in the shadow of}} political uncertainties, there is an urgent need for a reliable, safe, and cheap energy source. Thermonuclear fusion, if achieved, is that source of energy which not only will satisfy our demand for today but also for centuries to come. Today, there are two major approaches to achieve fusion: magnetic confinement fusion (MFE) and inertial confinement fusion (ICF). This dissertation explores the inertial confinement fusion using the fast ignition concept. Unlike the conventional approach where the same laser is used for compression and ignition, in fast ignition separate laser beams are used. This dissertation addresses three very important topics to fast ignition inertial confinement fusion. These are laser-to-electron coupling efficiency, laser-generated electron beam transport, and the associated isochoric heating. First, an integrated fast ignition experiment is carried out with 0. 9 kJ of energy in the <b>compression</b> <b>beam</b> and 70 J in the ignition beam. Measurements of absolute K{sub {alpha}} yield from the imploded core revealed that about 17 % of the laser energy is coupled to the suprathermal electrons. Modeling of the transport of these electrons and the associated isochoric heating, with the previously determined laser-to-electron conversion efficiency, showed a maximum target temperature of 166 eV at the front where the electron flux is higher and the density is lower. The contribution of the potential, induced by charge separation, in opposing the motion of the electrons was moderate. Second, temperature sensitivity of Cu K{sub {alpha}} imaging efficiency using a spherical Bragg reflecting crystal is investigated. It was found that due to the shifting and broadening of the K{sub {alpha}} line, with increasing temperature, both the brightness and the pattern of K{sub {alpha}} intensity are affected. Finally, x-ray spectroscopy of a 500 J 0. 7 ps laser-solid interactions showed the formation of a hot surface layer({approx} 1 {micro}m) {{at the front of the}} target. PIC simulations confirm surface heating...|$|E

40|$|Design of a {{damping ring}} in the ILC (International Lin-ear Collider) imposes bunch length of 6 mm rms and en-ergy spread of 0. 15 % rms. This paper investigates bunch {{compression}} that provides required <b>compression</b> of <b>beams</b> for the ILC. We present a short two-stage bunch compres-sor system that has been selected as alternative design in Baseline Configuration Design (BCD) for the ILC. The de-signed bunch compressor system has two rf sections and two chicanes in which each chicane consists of four bend-ing magnets. The bunch compressor system has a 680 m long that shows relatively short system length compared to baseline design for the ILC. Beams with bunch length of 6 mm rms extracted from the damping ring can be com-pressed to 0. 15 mm rms in the designed two-stage bunch compressor system that meets the required <b>compression</b> of <b>beams</b> for the ILC. We show results of beam tracking in the transverse and longitudinal planes including coherent and incoherent synchrotron radiations.
