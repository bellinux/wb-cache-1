5|$|The {{invention}} of electronic {{computers in the}} 1940s, along {{with the development of}} mathematical information theory, led to a realization that brains can potentially be understood as information processing systems. This concept formed the basis of the field of <b>cybernetics,</b> and eventually gave rise to the field now known as computational neuroscience. The earliest attempts at <b>cybernetics</b> were somewhat crude in that they treated the brain as essentially a digital computer in disguise, as for example in John von Neumann's 1958 book, The Computer and the Brain. Over the years, though, accumulating information about the electrical responses of brain cells recorded from behaving animals has steadily moved theoretical concepts in the direction of increasing realism.|$|E
5|$|Humans are {{corporeal}} beings and, as such, {{they are}} subject to examination and description by the natural sciences. Since mental processes are intimately related to bodily processes, the descriptions that the natural sciences furnish of human beings {{play an important role in}} the philosophy of mind. There are many scientific disciplines that study processes related to the mental. The list of such sciences includes: biology, computer science, cognitive science, <b>cybernetics,</b> linguistics, medicine, pharmacology, and psychology.|$|E
5|$|Campbell {{attended}} the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), {{where he was}} befriended by the eminent mathematician Norbert Wiener (who coined the term <b>cybernetics).</b> He began writing science fiction at age 18 and sold his first stories quickly. From January 1930 to June 1931, Amazing published six of his short stories, one novel, and six letters. Thus he was a well-known pulp writer at 21 – but he had failed German and MIT had dismissed him. After one year at Duke University, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in physics in 1932.|$|E
5|$|In electronics, {{magnetic}} core memory, radar, single electron transistors, and inertial guidance controls were invented or substantially developed by MIT researchers. Harold Eugene Edgerton {{was a pioneer}} in high speed photography and sonar. Claude E. Shannon developed much of modern information theory and discovered the application of Boolean logic to digital circuit design theory. In the domain of computer science, MIT faculty and researchers made fundamental contributions to <b>cybernetics,</b> artificial intelligence, computer languages, machine learning, robotics, and cryptography. At least nine Turing Award laureates and seven recipients of the Draper Prize in engineering have been or are currently associated with MIT.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{research into}} thinking machines {{was inspired by}} a confluence of ideas that became prevalent in the late 30s, 40s and early 50s. Recent research in neurology had shown that the brain was an electrical network of neurons that fired in all-or-nothing pulses. Norbert Wiener's <b>cybernetics</b> described control and stability in electrical networks. Claude Shannon's information theory described digital signals (i.e., all-or-nothing signals). Alan Turing's theory of computation showed that any form of computation could be described digitally. The close relationship between these ideas suggested that {{it might be possible to}} construct an electronic brain.|$|E
5|$|Whilst Bowlby's early {{writings}} on maternal deprivation {{may be seen}} as part of the background to the later development of attachment theory, there are many significant differences between the two. At the time of the 1951 publication, there was little research in this area and no comprehensive theory on the development of early relationships. Aside from its central proposition of the importance of an early, continuous and sensitive relationship, the monograph concentrates mostly on social policy. For his subsequent development of attachment theory, Bowlby drew on concepts from ethology, <b>cybernetics,</b> information processing, developmental psychology and psychoanalysis. The first early formal statements of attachment theory were presented in three papers in 1958, 1959 and 1960. His major work Attachment was published in three volumes between 1969 and 1980. Attachment theory revolutionised thinking on the nature of early attachments and extensive research continues to be undertaken.|$|E
25|$|Norbert Wiener's {{book was}} {{the forerunner of}} studies in <b>cybernetics,</b> and has {{influenced}} many theorists. It has impacted the fields of computers and technology, engineering, biology, sociology, and {{a broad range of}} other sciences. Numerous books have been published in relation to <b>cybernetics</b> theory which explore alternative concepts and models of feedback, human/machine relationships, systems science, and industrial advancement. William Ross Ashby, another founder of <b>cybernetics,</b> wrote the book Introduction to <b>Cybernetics,</b> which presents many new interpretations and definitions. Other theorists have produced writings on systems, communication, and the human experience in <b>cybernetics.</b> N. Katherine Hayles, author of How We Became Posthuman: Virtual Bodies in <b>Cybernetics,</b> Literature, and Informatics, describes the effects of technology in the age of virtual information and what it means for humans to live in an ever-advancing society. The American Society for <b>Cybernetics</b> (ASC) is a research association founded in 1964, the same year Wiener died, and is dedicated to the cooperative understanding and further improvement of <b>cybernetics</b> theory.|$|E

25|$|He is a past {{president}} of the American Society for <b>Cybernetics</b> (ASC). In 2007 Stuart Umpleby was awarded The Wiener Gold Medal of the American Society for <b>Cybernetics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following {{his work}} on {{biological}} <b>cybernetics</b> and social <b>cybernetics</b> Umpleby suggested a way of unifying the philosophies of realism, constructivism, and pragmatism by combining world, description, and observer.|$|E
25|$|The {{model was}} {{developed}} by operations research theorist and cybernetician Stafford Beer in his book Brain of the Firm (1972). Together with Beer's earlier works on <b>cybernetics</b> applied to management, this book effectively founded management <b>cybernetics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Norbert Wiener {{laid out}} the {{position}} that humans, machines and ecology are simply nodes in a network in his book <b>Cybernetics,</b> or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine, and this book became the bible of <b>cybernetics.</b>|$|E
25|$|This was {{the basis}} for the {{theoretical}} discipline of <b>cybernetics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Control theory, the {{grandchild}} of <b>cybernetics,</b> {{has many}} important applications, especially in robotics.|$|E
25|$|Sociocybernetics {{integrates}} sociology with second-order <b>cybernetics</b> and {{the work}} of Niklas Luhmann, along with the latest advances in complexity science. In terms of scholarly work, the focus of sociocybernetics has been primarily conceptual and only slightly methodological or empirical. Sociocybernetics is directly tied to systems thought inside and outside of sociology, specifically in the area of second-order <b>cybernetics.</b>|$|E
25|$|This episode investigates how machine ideas such as <b>cybernetics</b> {{and systems}} theory {{were applied to}} natural ecosystems, and how this relates to the false {{idea that there is}} a balance of nature. <b>Cybernetics</b> has been applied to human beings in an attempt to build {{societies}} without central control, self organising networks built of people, based on a fantasy view of nature.|$|E
25|$|And he {{has pointed}} out that George Soros's {{reflexivity}} theory is quite compatible with <b>cybernetics.</b>|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{simulations}} used {{in different}} fields developed largely independently, but 20th century studies of systems theory and <b>cybernetics</b> combined with spreading {{use of computers}} across all those fields have led to some unification and a more systematic view of the concept.|$|E
25|$|Wiener later {{helped develop}} the {{theories}} of <b>cybernetics,</b> robotics, computer control, and automation. He discussed the modeling of neurons with John von Neumann, and in a letter from November 1946 von Neumann presented his thoughts in advance of a meeting with Wiener.|$|E
25|$|Allende also {{undertook}} Project Cybersyn, {{a system}} of networked telex machines and computers. Cybersyn was developed by British <b>cybernetics</b> expert Stafford Beer.

25|$|In {{the history}} of aviation, Traian Vuia and Aurel Vlaicu built and tested some of the {{earliest}} aircraft designs, while Henri Coandă discovered the Coandă effect of fluidics. Victor Babeş discovered more than 50 germs and a cure for a disease named after him, babesiosis; biologist Nicolae Paulescu discovered insulin. Another biologist, Emil Palade, received the Nobel Prize for his contributions to cell biology. George Constantinescu created the theory of sonics, while mathematician Ştefan Odobleja is regarded as the ideological father behind <b>cybernetics</b> – his work The Consonantist Psychology (Paris, 1938) was the main source of inspiration for N.
