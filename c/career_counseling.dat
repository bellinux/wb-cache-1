5|$|The City of Everett {{selected}} a straightaway track segment east of downtown as the preferred {{location of a}} multimodal train/bus station, to replace the existing Amtrak station at Bond Street, in 1993. The Everett City Council chose a two-block industrial site bordered by Pacific Avenue to the north in 1995, estimating a cost of $30 million and an opening in 1998. Everett Mayor Ed Hansen proposed adding two additional stories to the station building to house classrooms and space for <b>career</b> <b>counseling</b> services, inspired by a similar project in Oakland, California. The Sound Transit Board passed a resolution in February 1999 allowing the use of $14 million to begin work on the Everett Multimodal Facility, {{which was to be}} the terminus for Sounder commuter rail and Sound Transit Express bus service. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on July 13, 2000, allowing for construction on Everett Station to begin. Sound Transit began with the construction of the Pacific Avenue overpass, replacing an earlier at-grade crossing, that opened on November 14, 2001 at a cost of $20 million. The station building was designed by the Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Partnership and built by Wilder Construction Company in 2000 and 2001.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} problem was that despite the Government efforts to support the provision of career guidance and counselling in public secondary schools, there was no readily available documented data of what is currently {{going on in the}} schools. Further more, during her literature review this researcher did not come across any study that had been carried out on the status of career guidance and counselling services in public secondary schools in Nairobi Province. The {{purpose of the study was}} therefore to assess the status of career guidance and counselling programmes for students in public secondary schools in Nairobi province. The specific objectives of the study were to: establish the status of <b>Career</b> Guidance and <b>Counseling</b> in public secondary schools; establish the availability and competence of Career Teacher Counsellors in public secondary schools; establish the availability and use of Career Guidance and Counselling resources in public secondary schools; find out the challenges in the effective implementation of <b>Career</b> and <b>Counseling</b> programmes in public secondary schools in Nairobi province and make recommendations on the ways of improving the status of <b>career</b> guidance and <b>counseling</b> in secondary schools. The population for the study were 65 public secondary schools in Nairobi Province. The target population were the 65 principals, 65 <b>career</b> guidance and <b>counseling</b> teachers and 5940 Form Three and Four students. Descriptive survey design was used for the study. Stratified and Purposive sampling methods were used. The primary data was collected by the use of questionnaires and an interview schedule. The study found that schools had different programmes for the implementation of <b>career</b> guidance and <b>counseling.</b> The study also found that the <b>career</b> guidance and <b>counseling</b> teachers were available but not adequately empowered with career guidance skills, knowledge and facilities to carry out effective career guidance services. The study further found that <b>career</b> guidance and <b>counseling</b> resources were available in schools but inadequate. The challenges facing the implementation of <b>career</b> guidance and <b>counseling</b> in public secondary schools were found to be the inadequacy of <b>career</b> guidance and <b>counseling</b> resources, overloading of <b>career</b> guidance and <b>counseling</b> teachers with academic class work and inadequate information on different careers. Based on these findings, the researcher recommended that secondary schools in Nairobi Province should be assisted to come up with varied programmes on <b>career</b> guidance and <b>counseling</b> which should be coordinated by a department in the ministry of education. It was also recommended that teachers should be trained on career guidance and counselling to improve their competences by organizing in-service trainings, seminars and workshops. The researcher finally suggested that a study be carried out on the Career Guidance training needs of all teachers in public secondary schools in Kenya. Kenyatta Universit...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effectiveness of <b>career</b> group <b>counseling</b> in raising the self-concept of at-risk high school students.

Two groups of students in the Lewisville Independent School District meeting the criteria for at-risk as defined by House Bill 1010 were administered a pretest and posttest using the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale. The experimental group was from the Lewisville Learning Center. The control group was students enrolled in the Coordinated Vocational Academic Education (CVAE) classes at Lewisville High School. A treatment sample of 25 students received <b>career</b> group <b>counseling.</b> A nontreatment sample of 25 students did not receive any group counseling. The t-test for independent samples was used to analyze the data. The pretests for the experimental and control groups showed no significant difference at the. 05 level.

At the end of 30 hours of counseling a posttest was administered to the treatment sample and to the control sample. The t-test for independent samples was used to analyze the data. While <b>career</b> group <b>counseling</b> appeared to impact the students in the experimental group, the limitations of sample size and population may have effected the results. The treatment was significant at the. 05 level and the null hypothesis was rejected.
