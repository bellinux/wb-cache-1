The carrier has laser scanners for one two-dimensional position sensor (120) to show its position in relation to the reference axis and a second two-dimensional position sensor (130) offset from the first and along the reference axis to show its position at right angles to the axis. An angle sensor (140), parallel to the reference axis, gives the carrier angle around a rotary axis. The reference axis is represented by a tensed steel wire (150) or a filament. USE - The system is for the detection of the position and orientation of a moving tool, e. g. the <b>calender</b> <b>roller</b> in paper finishing or a grinder. (Both claimed) ADVANTAGE - The assembly gives a highly accurate measurement of the position and orientation of the <b>calender</b> <b>roller</b> or grinder...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis refers {{experimental}} and theoretical {{studies of the}} calendering process making use of the pendulum device {{as a means to}} simulate the <b>roller</b> <b>calendering.</b> The main task has been to clarify characteristic feature of the device in its capacity to simulate the <b>calendering</b> process with <b>rollers.</b> Measurements are made to enlighten the dependency of the paper characteristics gloss, smoothness and density by the running conditions as nip load, dwell time, roller temperature and moisture content of the paper. Furthermore, the deformation of the fibres and the thermal conduction in the paper during the compression are studied. Finally, an {{experimental and}} analytical study of the heat transfer between the hammer and the paper specimen is made. The results are compared with results from <b>roller</b> <b>calenders</b> in the extent they are available in the literature. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
50|$|Calendering is an {{operation}} {{carried out on}} a fabric to improve its aesthetics. The fabric passes {{through a series of}} <b>calender</b> <b>rollers</b> by wrapping; the face in contact with a roller alternates from one roller to the next. An ordinary calender consists of a series of hard and soft (resilient) bowls (rollers) placed in a definite order. The soft roller may be compressed with either cotton or wool-paper, linen paper or flax paper. The hard metal bowl is either of chilled iron or cast iron or steel. The calender may consist of 3, 5, 6, 7 and 10 rollers. The sequence of the rollers is that no two hard rollers are in contact with each other. Pressure may be applied by compound levers and weights, or hydraulic pressure may be used as an alternative. The pressure and heat applied in calendering depend on the type of the finish required.|$|R

25|$|Preparing is {{the process}} used in place of carding for long wools and hairs which would break on the card and {{therefore}} greatly reduce {{the quality of the}} worsted yarn produced. The maker-up or double-screw sheeting preparer is the first machine. This passes the fibre to and from delivery sheets via rollers, and ends with a lap of wool from six to eight feet long. The single screw can preparer is the most important machine of these, as it is here that the laps of wool or hair taken from the preceding boxes are prepared into a continuous sliver. The lap is placed on the feed sheet and carried forward to the back rollers. From the back rollers the fibres are delivered to the fallers, which with the aid of the front rollers, draw out the material into a continuous sliver. From the front rollers the sliver of fibres passes through a funnel, through the <b>calender</b> <b>rollers</b> and into a can which is placed directly underneath them. The material is now ready for the combing machine.|$|R
25|$|In the French comb the {{slivers of}} wool are fed forward by ratchet-operated rollers and a pinned feed grid, the leading {{end of the}} fibres being pushed beyond the nipper jaws which open and shut to receive and hold them, leaving a fringe of fibres {{protruding}} through which the pins of the revolving cylinder comb pass, removing the short fibres or noil and any impurities. These are carried round to the underside and deposited in a box for removal. Whilst the above initial combing is taking place the drawing-off rollers, mounted on a carriage, move towards the nipper jaws and grip the fringe of fibres {{as soon as the}} last row of pins on the comb cylinder has passed through the fringe projecting from the nipper jaws. As the drawing-off rollers grip the projecting fringe, the intersector comb descends, piercing the fringe of fibres, the nipper jaws open and the fibres are given their second combing by the rotation and recession of the drawing-off rollers pulling the fibres through the pins of the intersector comb and the pins of the feed grid. The combed fibres are then conveyed by the leather apron of the drawing-off rollers to the front rollers of the carriage, down a funnel and through the <b>calender</b> <b>rollers,</b> into a can placed directly underneath.|$|R
50|$|Moire {{fabric is}} more {{delicate}} than {{fabric of the}} same type that has not gone through the calendering process. Also, contact with water removes the watermark and causes staining. Moire feels thin, glossy and papery due to the calendering process. Generally moire {{is made out of}} fabrics with a good body and defined ribs, such as grosgrain. Fabrics with defined ribs show the watered effect better than smooth fabrics like satin. Taffeta also works well. Fabrics with defined enough ribs can be <b>calendered</b> with smooth <b>rollers</b> and produce a moire finish; however generally the rollers have ribs that correspond to the grain of the fabric. The moire effect may be obtained on silk, worsted, or cotton fabrics, though it is impossible to develop it on anything other than a grained or fine corded weave.|$|R
