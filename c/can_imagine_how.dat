Thor clenched his hands on the shaft of the hammer so that the knuckles went white, and the peasant did as one might expect, and all his household, they cried out fervently, begged for grace, offered to atone with all their possessions.|$|E
25|$|The proneural protein Atonal (Ato) is {{responsible}} for the development of Drosophila’s R8 photoreceptors. However, it does not act alone, since it dimerizes with a second identical protein, ‘’Daughterless (Da)’’ that reinforces its expression. The coexpression of ‘’Ato’’ and ‘’Da’’ is important for the migration of the different cell types of an ommatidium and for the repression of atonal in the inter-cluster spaces, functioning as inhibitory signals that regulate both the number and position of the nascent R8 cells. Moreover, this expression leads to the activation of the kinase MAPK that is important for the cellular recruitment and the repressor effect, once, when this kinase is inactive the expression of ‘’Ato’’ is detected in every cell. In an initial state, Hedgehog (‘’Hh’’) and Decapentaplegic are responsible for the activation of ‘’ato’’ in small cellular clusters, leading to the activation of MAPK. First, Hedgehog induces ‘’ato’’ expression in more than just the cells that ultimately become photoreceptor cells, so its expression has to be refined and restricted to a single presumptive R8 cell. Hedgehog signaling is also required to repress ‘’atonal’’ expression between the nascent proneural clusters, which reveals a dual role crucial to building precision and geometry into the adult retina. Therefore, the regulation of ‘’ato’’ expression depends on the levels of Hedgehog: at low levels (that is far from the source) this pronuclear gene is activated and at high levels (close to the source) it is repressed. Combining lateral inhibition with the dual role played by Hedgehog, one <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>how</b> the hexagonal array of R8 cells can be patterned.|$|E
500|$|American {{environmentalist}} {{and writer}} Bill McKibben lamented the {{film on the}} Climate Progress website, where he wrote [...] "The climate skeptics can crow. It's the kind of stupidity that hurts our side, reinforcing in people's minds a series of preconceived notions, {{not the least of}} which is that we're out-of-control and out of touch—not to mention off the wall, and also with completely misplaced sense of humor". McKibben added [...] "There's no question that crap like this will cast a shadow, for a time, over our efforts and everyone else who's working on global warming. McKibben subsequently withdrew as an organisational partner of 10:10. When The Daily Caller asked about the film, environmental organisation Greenpeace spokeswoman Jane Kochersperger stated that [...] "as an organisation committed to non-violence, I think you <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>how</b> Greenpeace views this material. At this time, the only people promoting the material are climate skeptics and think tanks funded by corporations known for lobbying against climate change legislation". Five other environmental groups contacted by The Daily Caller did not comment on the film.|$|E

2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Bird was delighted with the victory, calling his achievement [...] "incredible" [...] and congratulated Formula E for organising the ePrix: [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>how</b> difficult it was, but it’s been an amazing week so far. We had pretty good speed today." [...] He said that the Berlin races were [...] "a turning point" [...] for his team {{as they had been}} extensively educated on their performance and praised his teammate Lynn for taking the pole position. Vergne was pleased to finish in second place but claimed his getaway off the grid prevented him from winning the race as there was a large amount of dirt off the racing line which caused him to lose positions. However, he was aware he could reclaim ground in the opening phase of the event, and increased his pace to conserve more electrical energy than Bird and felt the latter deserved the victory. Sarrazin said that he felt [...] "very good" [...] to secure a third-place finish, and despite making a small error in qualifying, he was aware that his car was good but felt [...] "lucky" [...] because of Abt's final lap problem.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{spent the}} Fall quarter (of 1950) at RAND. My first {{task was to}} find a name for {{multistage}} decision processes. An interesting question is, Where did the name, dynamic programming, come from? The 1950s were not good years for mathematical research. We had a very interesting gentleman in Washington named Wilson. He was Secretary of Defense, and he actually had a pathological fear and hatred of the word research. I’m not using the term lightly; I’m using it precisely. His face would suffuse, he would turn red, and he would get violent if people used the term research in his presence. You <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>how</b> he felt, then, about the term mathematical. The RAND Corporation was employed by the Air Force, and the Air Force had Wilson as its boss, essentially. Hence, I felt I had to do something to shield Wilson and the Air Force from the fact that I was really doing mathematics inside the RAND Corporation. What title, what name, could I choose? In the first place I was interested in planning, in decision making, in thinking. But planning, is not a good word for various reasons. I decided therefore to use the word “programming”. I wanted to get across the idea that this was dynamic, this was multistage, this was time-varying. I thought, let's kill two birds with one stone. Let's take a word that has an absolutely precise meaning, namely dynamic, in the classical physical sense. It also has a very interesting property as an adjective, and that it's impossible to use the word dynamic in a pejorative sense. Try thinking of some combination that will possibly give it a pejorative meaning. It's impossible. Thus, I thought dynamic programming was a good name. It was something not even a Congressman could object to. So I used it as an umbrella for my activities." ...|$|E
