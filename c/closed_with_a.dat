Tennessee scored first, on a 59-yard Tauren Poole touchdown run to take an early 7–0 lead. Alabama responded by scoring on its next two drives: a 36-yard Jeremy Shelley field goal, and a one-yard Greg McElroy touchdown run to take a 10–7 lead. The second quarter <b>closed</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 42-yard Shelley field goal and a 33-yard field goal by Michael Palardy of Tennessee to make the halftime score 13–10.|$|E
5|$|Davide Cassani won {{the fifteenth}} stage that {{featured}} a summit finish to Lumezzane, while the general classification remained largely unaltered. The next day of racing saw {{a break from}} the mountains, with a primarily flat course that stretched from Varazze to Pontechianale. The stage ultimately finished with a bunch sprint that was won by Italian Fabio Baldato. The Giro's seventeenth stage concluded with a summit finish to Chianale. Marco Saligari won the stage by over a minute on the second-place finisher Gianluca Bortolami, while the general classification contenders finished together leaving the classification largely unchanged. Stage eighteen was a primarily flat stage that <b>closed</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> field sprint. Adriano Baffi won the field sprint and the stage, which was his third stage victory at the Giro that year.|$|E
5|$|Each {{account is}} <b>closed</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{miniature}} woodcut known from {{its position in}} the text as a tail-piece. These small artworks depict aspects of country life, often with humorous subjects, but all with Bewick's eye for detail, style, and precision. Some add to the illustration of the bird in question, as for example the heron, where the tail-piece shows one heron catching an eel, and another flying away. The tail-piece for Sabine's snipe, a gamebird, shows a hunter firing, and a small bird falling to the ground. There is no exclusion of human life from the images: one tail-piece depicts a works complete with smoking chimney beside a river.|$|E

5|$|In 1885 Gaudí {{accepted}} a commission from Josep Maria Bocabella, promotor of the Sagrada Família, for an altar in the oratory of the Bocabella family, who had obtained {{permission from the}} Pope to have an altar in their home. The altar is made of varnished mahogany, with a slab of white marble in the centre for relics. It is decorated with plants and religious motifs, such as the Greek letters alpha and omega, symbol of the beginning and end, gospel phrases and images of Saint Francis of Paola, Saint Teresa of Avila and the Holy Family and <b>closed</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> curtain of crimson embroidery.

5|$|Michael Vehe, a Dominican monk and theologian, took in 1537 {{the medieval}} stanza as a {{starting}} point which he completed by adding three different stanzas. His version appears with the chant melody in the first German Catholic hymnal Gotteslob as GL 870 for the Diocese of Limburg. In the main section of that hymnal, it appeared as GL 248 again in a different version, with stanzas two to four written in 1972 by Maria Luise Thurmair, who <b>closed</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fifth stanza modeled after Vehe's second. The melody is a transcription of the chant in fixed rhythm. This version was kept in the second edition of the Gotteslob, GL 348.|$|E

5|$|Passing {{from these}} {{historic}} examples {{we find the}} chair monopolized by the ruler, lay or ecclesiastical, to a comparatively late date. As the seat of authority it stood {{at the head of}} the lord’s table, on his dais, by the side of his bed. The seigneurial chair, more common in France and the Netherlands than in England, is a very interesting type, approximating in many respects to the episcopal or abbatial throne or stall. It early acquired a very high back and sometimes had a canopy. Arms were invariable, and the lower part was closed in with panelled or carved front and sides—the seat, indeed, was often hinged and sometimes <b>closed</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> key.|$|E
5|$|Juventus re-capitalized on 28 June 2007, {{increasing}} €104,807,731.60 of share capital. The {{team made}} an aggregate net {{loss in the}} following seasons (2006 to date): –€927,569 (2006–07), –€20,787,469 (2007–08), net income €6,582,489 (2008–09) and net loss €10,967,944 (2009–10). After an unaudited €43,411,481 net loss was recorded {{in the first nine}} months of 2010–11 season, the board of directors announced that a capital increase of €120million was planned, scheduled to submit to the extraordinary shareholder's meeting in October. Eventually, the 2010–11 season net loss was €95,414,019. In the 2012–13 season, Juventus continued to recover from recent seasons' net losses thanks to the biggest payment in UEFA's Champions League 2012–13 revenue distribution, earning €65.3million. Despite being knocked out in the quarterfinal stage, Juventus took the lion's share thanks to the largesse of the Italian national TV market and the division of revenues with the only other Italian team making the competition's final phase, Milan. Confirming the trend of marked improvement in net result, the 2013–14 financial year <b>closed</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> loss of €6.7 million, but with the first positive operating income since 2006. In the 2014–15 season, by the excellent sports results achieved (the fourth year in a row of Serie A titles, the tenth Coppa Italia title and playing the Champions League final), net income reached €2.3million. Compared to the loss of €6.7million last year, 2014–15 showed a positive change of €9million and returned to a profit after six years since 2008–09.|$|E
5|$|Night {{was welcomed}} by the German and Polish forces {{surrounding}} Mont Ormel. Fighting was sporadic, as both sides avoided contact with one another. Frequent Polish artillery barrages interrupted German attempts {{to retreat from}} the sector. In the morning, German attacks on the position resumed. Although not as coordinated as on the day before, the attack still managed to reach {{the last of the}} Polish defenders on Mont Ormel. As the remaining Polish forces repelled the assault, their tanks were forced to use the last of their ammunition. At approximately 12:00, the last SS remnants launched a final assault on the positions of the 9th Battalion. Polish forces defeated them at point-blank range. There would be no further attacks; the two battlegroups of the Polish 1st Armoured Division had survived the onslaught, despite being surrounded by German forces for three days. Both Reynolds and McGilvray place the Polish losses on the Maczuga at 351 killed and wounded and 11 tanks lost, although Jarymowycz gives higher figures of 325 killed, 1,002 wounded, and 114 missing — approximately 20% of the division's combat strength. Within an hour, The Canadian Grenadier Guards managed to link up with what remained of Stefanowicz's men. By late afternoon, the remainder of the 2nd and 9th SS Panzer Divisions had begun their retreat to the Seine River. The Falaise Gap had been permanently <b>closed,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large number of German forces still trapped in the pocket.|$|E

The film was shown on the aircraft's video {{monitors}} during the flight from New York to Los Angeles. American Airlines provided the Boeing 767 gratis. Smith performed a few songs including Help Yourself in the aisle of the aircraft.

The screening of the film was followed by a conversation with cast members Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick. The Starz Denver Film Festival closed on November 22, 2009 with a screening of Up in the Air, with an introduction by J.K. Simmons, who was in town to accept the festival's Cassavetes Award earlier that afternoon.
