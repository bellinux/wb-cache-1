5|$|Alexander Luttrell, who {{inherited}} Dunster Castle in 1910, {{chose to}} live at East Quantoxhead instead, and it was left empty until his son Geoffrey reoccupied the castle in 1920, redecorating some of the rooms in a contemporary style and building a polo ground alongside the castle. The castle and the surrounding countryside at this time was very popular with the Luttrells for fox hunting and shooting. During the Second World War the castle {{was used as a}} <b>convalescent</b> <b>home</b> for injured naval and American officers between 1943 and 1944.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, {{the house}} saw {{service as a}} {{depository}} for the evacuated Wallace Collection and a <b>convalescent</b> <b>home.</b> A troop of gunners occupied the decaying service wing, and the park {{was used for the}} inflation of barrage balloons. During this turmoil, the Dashwoods retreated to the upper floor and took in lodgers to pay the bills, albeit very superior lodgers, who included Nancy Mitford and James Lees-Milne, who was secretary of the Country House Committee of the National Trust and instrumental in the Trust's acquisition of many such houses. In 1943, Sir John gave the house and grounds to the National Trust, on condition that he and his descendants could continue living in the house.|$|E
5|$|The new rectory {{was built}} by the Reverend John Ellershaw in the 1870s. The last rector to occupy it was Lionel St. Clair Waldy from 1907 to 1945. It was then bought by Douglas Wills who donated it and the rectory field to Winford Hospital as a <b>convalescent</b> <b>home</b> for 16 children, and later used as a nurses' home before being sold for private use. Primarily an {{orthopaedic}} hospital, Winford was built in 1930, and became a part-military and part-civilian hospital. Wards A to D were for civilian use, while wards E to K, added {{to the hospital in}} 1940, were for the treatment of service and civilian war casualties. The hospital closed in 1996, and the rectory is now divided into several residential units.|$|E
5|$|After inheriting Osborne, the King had his mother's {{personal}} {{photographs and}} belongings removed {{and some of}} them destroyed, especially material relating to John Brown, whom he detested. Queen Victoria had intended the house to be a private, secluded residence for her descendants, away from the pomp and ceremony of mainland life. However, the new King had no need for the house and consulted his lawyers about disposing of it, transforming the main wing into a <b>convalescent</b> <b>home,</b> opening the state apartments to the public, and constructing a Naval College on the grounds. His plans met with strong disapproval from Beatrice and Louise. Queen Victoria had bequeathed them houses on the estate, and the privacy promised to them by their mother was threatened. When Edward discussed the fate of the house with them, Beatrice argued against allowing the house to leave the family, citing its importance to their parents.|$|E

5|$|Built as the Mont Dore Hotel in 1881, Bournemouth Town Hall was {{designated}} a Grade II listed building in 2001. Designed by Alfred Bedborough in the French, Italian and neo-classical styles, the foundation stone was laid by King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway {{and the hotel}} opened in 1885. The buff brick exterior features Bath stone dressings and terracotta friezes. The main entrance is sited within a projected façade that reaches to the eaves and is topped with a pediment, while above sits a belvedere with turrets and a pavilion roof. During the First World War the hotel {{was used as a}} hospital for British and Indian soldiers and after as a <b>convalescent</b> <b>home.</b> It never opened as a hotel again and was purchased by Bournemouth Borough Council in 1919.|$|E
5|$|The {{successive}} {{rulers of}} Monaco tended to live elsewhere and visit their palace only occasionally. Charles III was succeeded in 1889 by Albert I. Albert married Lady Mary Victoria Douglas-Hamilton, {{a daughter of}} Scotland's 11th duke of Hamilton, and his German wife, a princess of Baden. The couple had one son, Louis, before their marriage was annulled in 1880. Albert was a keen scientist and founded the Oceanographic Institute in 1906; as a pacifist he then founded the International Institute of Peace in Monaco. Albert's second wife, Alice Heine, an American banking heiress who was the widow of a French duke, did much to turn Monte Carlo into a cultural centre, establishing both ballet and the opera in the city. Having brought a large dowry into the family she contemplated turning the casino into a <b>convalescent</b> <b>home</b> for the poor who would benefit from recuperation in warm climes. The couple, however, separated before Alice {{was able to put}} her plan into action.|$|E
5|$|For the {{invasion}} of Poland in September 1939, his regiment {{was attached to the}} XIII Army Corps, a part of the 8th Army. Near Warsaw on 24 September, he was one of four men selected by his company commander, then SS-Hauptsturmführer Wilhelm Mohnke to negotiate the surrender of Polish troops during the Battle of Modlin. He was picked because of his ability, although very limited, to speak Polish. After the negotiations failed, the Germans headed back to their lines. When they were about 80 metres from the fort, firing began. Several rounds struck Misch, who fell down and lost consciousness. Some German soldiers carried him to an aid station. Later, he was transferred to two different hospitals. Thereafter, he spent six weeks at a <b>convalescent</b> <b>home.</b> For his actions, Misch was awarded the Iron Cross, Second Class. As Misch was the last living member of his Lower Silesian family, Mohnke recommended him for the Führerbegleitkommando (Führer Escort Command; FBK). This was made up of SS members, including men from the LSSAH, who were not serving on the front lines.|$|E

50|$|Before 1914 {{those who}} could afford private nursing care were {{generally}} looked after in their own homes, but in the 1920s that began to change. In 1921 there were 25,981 patients in nursing and <b>convalescent</b> <b>homes.</b> In the 1931 census there were 54,920. The standards of nursing care, however, were low.|$|R
50|$|In 1958 the Congregation of Bon Secours in the United States {{became a}} {{separate}} Province.

25|$|Paybody Hospital {{opened in}} 1929 as a <b>convalescent</b> <b>home</b> for {{crippled}} children when Thomas Paybody donated £2,000, {{together with a}} large house in Allesley, to the Coventry Crippled Children's Guild.
