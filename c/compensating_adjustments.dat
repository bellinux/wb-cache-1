Associated polynomials are defined and used in the presentation of a computer algorithm suitable for accomplishing a partial fraction expansion including repeated roots.

40|$|The weaver mouse {{represents}} the only genetic animal model of gradual nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration which is proposed as a pathophysiological phenotype of Parkinson`s disease. The {{aim of the}} present study was to analyze the nitric oxide and dopaminergic systems in selected brain regions of homozygous weaver mice at different postnatal ages corresponding to specific stages of the dopamine loss. Structural deficits were evaluated by quantification of tyrosine hydroxylase and neuronal nitric oxide synthase-immunostaining in the cortex, striatum, accumbens nuclei, subthalamic nuclei, ventral tegmental area, and substantia nigra compacta of 10 -day, 1 - and 2 -month-old wildtype and weaver mutant mice. The results confirmed the progressive loss of dopamine during the postnatal development in the adult weaver mainly affecting the substantia nigra pars compacta, striatum, and subthalamic nucleus and slightly affecting the accumbens nuclei and ventral tegmental area. A general decrease in neuronal nitric oxide synthase-immunostaining with age was revealed in both the weaver and wild-type mice, with the decrease being most pronounced in the weaver. In contrast, there was an increase in the substantia nigra pars compacta nitric oxide synthase-immunostaining and a decrease mainly in the subthalamic and accumbens nuclei of the 2 -month-old weaver mutant. The decrease in the expression of nNOS may bear functional significance related to the process of aging. DA neurons from the substantia nigra directly modulate the activity of subthalamic nucleus neurons, and their loss may contribute to the abnormal activity of subthalamic nucleus neurons. Although the functional significance of these changes is not clear, it may represent plastic <b>compensating</b> <b>adjustments</b> resulting from the loss of dopamine innervation, highlighting a possible role of nitric oxide in this process.

40|$|This paper {{decomposes}} {{changes in}} inequality, which has in general been increasing {{in the transition}} economies of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, both by income source and socio-economic group, {{with a view to}} understanding the determinants of inequality and assessing how it might evolve in the future. The empirical analysis relies on a set of inequality statistics that, unlike"official data", are consistent and comparable across countries and are based on primary records from household surveys recently put together for the World Bank study"Growth, Poverty and Inequality in Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union: 1998 - 2003 "[World Bank (2005 b) ]. The increase in inequality in transition, as predicted by a number of theoretical models, in practice differed substantially across countries, with the size and speed of its evolution depending on the relative importance of its key determinants, viz., changes in the wage distribution, employment, entrepreneurial incomes and social safety nets. Its evolution was also influenced by policy. This diversity of outcomes is exemplified on the one hand for Central Europe by Poland, where the increase in inequality has been steady but gradual and reflects, inter alia, larger changes in employment and <b>compensating</b> <b>adjustments</b> in social safety nets and, on the other for the Commonwealth of Independent States by Russia, where an explosive overshooting of inequality peaked in the mid- 1990 s before being moderated through the extinguishing of wage arrears during its post- 1998 recovery. The paper argues that the process of transition to a market economy is not complete and that further evolution of inequality will depend both on (i) transition-related factors, such as the evolution of the education premium, a bias in the investment climate against new private sector firms which are important vehicles of job creation and regional impediments to mobility of goods and labor, as well as increasingly (ii) other factors, such as technological change and globalization. The paper also contrasts key features of inequality in Russia in the context of other transition economies with trends in inequality observed in China where rapid economic growth has been accompanied by a steep increase in inequality. It argues that the latter's experience is, to a large extent, a developmental, rather than a transition-related phenomenonderiving from the rural-urban divide and is, therefore, of limited relevance for predicting changes in inequality in Russia.

40|$|The {{ability to}} express thought in language, to communicate, and to rapidly {{understand}} {{who did what}} to whom is a highly complex cognitive skill and ultimately the cognitive trait that defines us as being human. For the most part, language comprehension runs very smoothly and people perform it extremely quickly and efficiently. One might think this is nothing exceptional, {{were it not for}} the fact that everyday speech contains plenty of ambiguities, speech errors, and otherwise conflicting or interfering information. Similar to any other cognitive system, the language system is fitted out with mechanisms that detect conflicts and trigger <b>compensating</b> <b>adjustments</b> ‘on-the-fly’ in order to make sense of what has been said. Inevitably, language comprehension requires a combination of automatic and controlled processes and, depending on the context, we engage in both to varying degrees. Historically, linguistic conflict resolution has been investigated regarding to what extent linguistic modules such as ‘syntax’ and ‘semantics’ contribute to the process. In this thesis I take a step away from the traditional approach towards the question how the mechanisms underlying linguistic conflict resolution fit into domain-general cognition. It has been shown that controlled processing reliably results in activation of large-scale networks throughout the cortex. Importantly, neuroimaging studies have shown that the crucial brain region that enables us to flexibly make adjustments is the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In this thesis I present four case studies that investigated brain oscillations (as recorded in the EEG and MEG signal) in the time-frequency- (TFR), amplitude-time- (ERP), and source domain to determine how the language system relates to general executive functions. The materials employed structures that are amongst the most well-studied in psycholinguistic research: locally ambiguous garden-path sentences (e. g. “The nurse examined by the doctor was not on duty”), gender-agreement mismatches in anaphora and cataphora (e. g. “The king left London after reminding himself/herself about the letter”/ “After reminding himself/herself about the letter, the king left London. ”), and syntactically complex garden-path sentences (“The receptionist realized that the nurse examined by the doctor was not on duty. ”). The results in this thesis support the notion that there is indeed a connection between the language system and general executive functions during linguistic conflict resolution. Still, there are also situations where specialized ‘modules’ perform conflict resolution in a highly automatised fashion, particularly when contextual information sufficiently cues future input. However, as soon as increased uncertainty comes into play or capacity limits are reached, the brain appears to rely on extremely flexible mechanisms in prefrontal cortex regions...|$|E
40|$|The {{appropriate}} {{literature has}} been reviewed {{for the purpose}} of defining the phenomenon of stress in lactating dairy cattle, establishing a baseline concept of lactation stress and emphasizing the most significant aspects of the natural mammary defence mechanisms. Data on the general adaptation syndrome (GAS) make it clear that stress is essentially the rate of wear and tear of the biological system affected by a stressor either eliciting stress of the organism as a whole or partly so. Owing to the variety of stressors which may affect the dairy cow at physiological and pathological levels, a definition of stress in the broad sense is indicated. This is essential {{from the point of view}} of the anti-homeostatic effects (metabolic and immunological) of lactation stress, aggravated by anti-homeostatic effects elecited by superimposed other types of stress (e. g. heat stress). The lactating cow, as a ruminant in a state of sustained stress, requires a special profile of hormonal mediators. In high yielding cows, for example, acute and sustained heat stress promotes increased activities of prolactin, progesterone and catecholamines. Compared with the mainly glycogenic/glycogenolytic metablolism of non-ruminant mammals, the lipogenic/lipolytic and glycogenic/glycogenolytic metabolism of the dairy cow depends on hormonal mediators which differ from those of the former not so much in their nature but in their magnitude and ratios. Stressors induce the development of GAS reactions in the dairy cow. These enable the cow to create and maintain homeostasis of its integrated 3 main physio-pathological systems and thus to endure the stressor(s). The cow's <b>compensating</b> <b>adjustments</b> to a stressor are therefore the effects of stress. This means that natural lactation is the effect of the lactation stress induced by the cow's progeny (i. e. the natural lactation stressor). Artificial lactation stressors (e. g. removal of milk by hand and machine) may affect the lactation stress in magnitude but not necessarily in nature. Likewise, a range of behavioural, physiological, lactational and lacteal changes related to other stressors are the effects of different types of stress. Lactation stress, like other types of stress, shows 3 stages of development, i. e., an overcompensating alarm phase (= lactogenesis), resistance phase (= galactopoiesis) and exhaustion phase (= regression). They facilitate adjustments of the cow's homeostasis from the level of involutional homeostasis (= no lactational activity) to that of lactational homeostasis. Like other tissues in a state of stress, the lactating mammary epithelium requires a greatly increased supply of glucose. This causes the glucose metabolism of the lactating cow to become so precarious that in the secretory mammary epithelium glucose is being reserved for specific key functions, such as balance of energy and electrolytes, and formation of lactose, NADPH and citrate. The secretory epithelium is therefore particularly susceptible to fluctuations of its oxydative glucose metabolism, which, in turn, enables the cow readily to control the number of secretory cells, their level of secretory activities and the integrity of the secretory epithelium. For that reason, mammary regression, unphysiological both in magnitude and timing, if stimulated in dairy cattle by stressful conditions superimposed on normal lactation stress, is of primary importance as a counter-measure to galactopoiesis, and the main predisposing factor to mastitogenic infection. Mammary regression may be considered the cow's inherent, non-specific response to stressors affecting it and/or its lactating udder. Stressful conditions, superimposed on the lactation stress, promote increased intramammary activities of adrenalin, which contribute to unphysiological mammary regression. Adrenalin also affects the bacterial trapping component, reverse pumping component and other components of the proposed 3 core systems of the natural defence mechanisms of the lactating bovine udder. This unfavourable effect of adrenalin on udder health may be further aggravated by various hormonal mediators in the plasma and milk. From the data reviewed it is evident that stress may elicit significant lactational and lacteal fluctuations jeopardize the anti-microbial efficacy of the natural defence mechanisms of the udder and increase the risk of unphysiological mammary regression and subclinical and clinical mastitogenic udder infections. It is clear therefore that stress may be of eminent importance to the 3 major determinants of bovine udder health, namely, intramammary integrity, somatic cellular defence and bacterial challenge.

The ATO’s determination rejected cost base inclusion. The central criticism in that previous article was that the determination was technically flawed. Feedback on the original article raised two issues: (1) Does the application of the GAAR have the effect of setting aside the relevant scheme, or does the GAAR only set aside the relevant tax benefit? And (2) What is the proper order of application of the relevant tax rules in regard to a split loan? The answer to these questions may be determinative of the issue debated here. Regrettably, there is little judicial consideration of these issues in the authorities. This article has two main parts. Section 1 deals with the effect of the GAAR operating in regard to a scheme. Section 2 deals with the order in which relevant tax rules apply. As a matter of policy, the further interest and the compound interest under a split loan should not be included in the cost base of the investment property.

Recent research has turned to fiscal federalism {{as a source of}} fiscal imbalance and to exploit the variation in fiscal experience. This study allows a comparison of the control regime of decentralized government in Denmark with neighbors Norway and Sweden and with similar analyses of US states. Fiscal adjustments are investigated in the context of responses to shocks. Shocks are measured as deviations from budgeted current surplus, and they motivate an adjustment of tax rates and current expenditure to avoid fiscal imbalance. The econometric results show that local governments in Denmark respond to shocks by <b>compensating</b> <b>adjustment</b> of tax rates and expenditures. The shock responses tend to be asymmetric, in particular for the income tax. Positive shocks hardly affect the income tax rate, while negative shocks induce higher tax rates. We interpret the asymmetry as the result of spending pressure due to redistributive politics, and show that political characteristics are important for tax determination.

In this work, we explored the opportunity to select mutants impaired in respiration and/or altered in dark metabolism by measuring maximum photosynthetic efficiency by chlorophyll fluorescence analyses (FV/FM). Out of about 2900 hygromycin-resistant insertional mutants generated from wild type or from a mutant strain deficient in state transitions (stt 7 strain), 22 were found to grow slowly in heterotrophic conditions and 8 of them also showed a lower FV/FM value. Several disrupted coding sequences were identified, including genes coding for three different subunits of respiratory-chain complex I (NUO 9, NUOA 9, NUOP 4) or for isocitrate lyase (ICL 1). Overall, the comparison of respiratory mutants obtained in wild-type or stt 7 genetic backgrounds indicated that the FV/FM value can be used to isolate mutants severely impaired in dark metabolism.

40|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that the brain can use an internally generated copy of motor commands, a corollary discharge, to guide rapid sequential saccades. Much of this evidence comes from the double-step paradigm: after two briefly flashed visual targets have disappeared, the subject makes two sequential saccades to the targets. Recent studies on the monkey revealed that amplitude variations of the first saccade led to compensation by the second saccade, mediated by a corollary discharge. Here, we investigated whether such saccade-by-saccade compensation occurs in humans, and we made three new observations. First, we replicated previous findings from the monkey: following first saccade amplitude variations, {{the direction of the}} second saccade compensated for the error. Second, the change in direction of the second saccade followed variations in vertical as well as horizontal first saccades although the compensation following horizontal saccades was significantly more accurate. Third, by examining oblique saccades, we are able to show that first saccade variations are <b>compensated</b> by <b>adjustment</b> in saccade amplitude in addition to direction. Together, our results demonstrate that it is likely that a corollary discharge in humans can be used to adjust both saccade direction and amplitude following variations in individual saccades...|$|R
40|$|The {{utilization}} of stereolithography molds {{in the manufacture}} pre-series for injection molded plastic parts aims to reduce costs throughout the product life-time, but mainly during design and manufacturing phases. The use of this Rapid Tooling technique in powder metal injection molding is evaluated in this work. One of the greatest differences between traditional and stereolithography tools {{is related to the}} heat conductivity of the materials employed. For example, steel molds have a heat conductivity coefficient 300 times higher than molds made with the photosensitive resin used in the stereolithography process. The discrepancy regarding the cooling rate of the molded parts during the injection cycle must be <b>compensated</b> with <b>adjustments</b> in the injection molding parameters, such as temperature, pressure and speed. The optimization of these parameters made it possible to eject green parts from the mold without causing defects which would become evident in debinding and sintering stages. The dimensional analysis performed {{at the end of each}} case study showed that the shrinking factor of the component after the sintering had the same value obtained for components using traditional metallic molds. Moreover, the dimensional error remains under 2 % which can be considered low for a pre-series of components (or prototype series) ...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{propose a}} new procedure, {{designated}} the adjoint-based genesis diagnostic (AGD) procedure, for studying triggering mechanisms {{and the subsequent}} genesis of the synoptic phenomena of interest. This procedure makes use of a numerical model sensitivity to initial conditions and the nonlinear evolution of the initial perturbations that are designed using this sensitivity. The model sensitivity is evaluated using the associated adjoint model. This study uses the dry version of the National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Adjoint Modeling System (MAMS) for the numerical experiments. The authors apply the AGD procedure to two cases of Alpine lee cyclogenesis that were observed during the Alpine Experiment special observations period. The {{results show that the}} sensitivity fields that are produced by the adjoint model and the associated initial perturbations are readily related to the probable triggering mechanisms for these cyclones. Additionally, the nonlinear evolution of these initial perturbations points toward the physical processes involved in the lee cyclone formation. The AGD experiments for a weak cyclone case indicate that the MAMS forecast model has an underrepresented topographic forcing due to the sigma vertical coordinate and that this model error can be <b>compensated</b> by <b>adjustments</b> in the initial conditions that are related to the triggering mechanisms, which is not associated with the topographic blocking mechanism...|$|R
40|$|A new {{theoretical}} {{method is}} presented for designing frequency responses of double-tuned, low-pass birdcage coils. This method {{is based on}} Kirchhoff's equations through a nonsymmetric matrix algorithm and extended through a modification of the corresponding eigenvalue system from a single-tuned mode. Designs from this method are verified for sodium/proton, dual-tuned, double-quadrature, low-pass birdcage coils at 1. 5 Telsa and 3. 0 Tesla and then are used to design dual-tuned, double-quadrature, lithium/proton and phosphorus/proton birdcage coils for 3. 0 Tesla. All frequencies show experimental deviations of less than 3 % from theory under unloaded conditions. The frequency shifts caused by loading and radiofrequency shielding are less than 1 MHz and can be <b>compensated</b> readily by <b>adjustment</b> of variable capacitors. Applications to human neuroimaging and spectroscopy are demonstrated. Magn Reson Med 41 : 268 – 275, 1999. © 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
