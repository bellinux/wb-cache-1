It is {{the only}} Mexican {{institution}} authorized to perform, in an integrated manner, the activities of safe-keeping, custody, management, clearing, settlement and transfer of securities. In this article, we report the modeling, simulation and analysis of a new Securities Settlement System (SSS) implemented by INDEVAL, {{as part of a}} project for the implementation of a safer and more efficient operating system. The main objective of this research was to use reduced amounts of cash and securities, within reasonable periods of time, for the settlement of securities of the Mexican market. A linear programming model for the netting and <b>clearing</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> was used. The performance of the new SSS was evaluated by performing experiments using a deterministic simulation model under different operation parameters, such as the number and monetary value of transactions, the time between clearing cycles and also under a new set of rules for pre-settlement operations. The results presented may be used by other Central Securities Depositories to make decisions related to the efficient and safer use of their resources. The implementation of the model took more than three years. Now many transactions that would remain pending if processed individually are settled together, thus reducing liquidity requirements dramatically -by 52 % in cash and 26 % in securities...|$|E

40|$|Cities in the post-industrial era are {{laced with}} {{interstitial}} edge-spaces formed largely by infrastructural and hydrological processes. Such linear spaces form rifts {{in the urban}} fabric which designing typically attempts to mitigate, either by stitching it up with buildings or filling it with linear parks. While the linear - or thin - park has been historically marginalized in design practice, the decline of industrial-era infrastructure is transforming cities and, accordingly, design opportunities. In this new context - based on an analysis of 20 linear parks from Europe and North America - the paper tenders a suite of characteristics particular to the typology of elongated landscapes. The paper aims to establish a <b>clearer</b> scope <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> {{for the design of}} thin parks, both in terms of particular design qualities and larger contextual influences...|$|R
