Following <b>customary</b> <b>procedure</b> while in port, her reactor was shut down. Since no shore power connection was available in San Juan, the ship's backup diesel generator was used to carry the [...] "hotel" [...] electrical loads. Several hours later, the backup generator broke down and the electrical load {{was transferred to the}} ship's battery; however, most of the battery power was needed to keep vital systems operating and to restart the reactor, so lighting and air-conditioning were shut down. Without air-conditioning, temperature and humidity in the submarine rose, reaching [...] after about ten hours. (Four men received Navy Commendation Medals for their work that night, attempting to repair the diesel generator under the extreme conditions of heat and humidity.) Eventually, it became apparent that repair of the generator would not be complete before the battery was depleted, so restart of the reactor was attempted, but by that time, there was not enough charge remaining in the battery, and it ran down before restart of the reactor could be accomplished. The captain, returning to the ship from a shore function, arrived just after the battery ran down. Since Cavalla was moored alongside, cables, borrowed from another ship in the harbor, were connected between Thresher and Cavalla, which started her diesels, providing power that enabled Thresher to restart her reactor.|$|E

How had {{he managed to}} go on so long in that town devoid of the scent of sweetpeas, where he had not even space to put his treasures? True, those had been years with {{no time at all}} for looking at them--years of almost passionate money-making, during which Forsyte, Bustard and Forsyte had become solicitors to more limited Companies than they could properly attend to. Up to the City of a morning in a Pullman car, down from the City of an evening in a Pullman car. Law papers again after dinner, then the sleep of the tired, and up again next morning. Saturday to Monday was spent at his Club in town--curious reversal of <b>customary</b> <b>procedure,</b> based on the deep and careful instinct that while working so hard he needed sea air to and from the station twice a day, and while resting must indulge his domestic affections. The Sunday visit to his family in Park Lane, to Timothy's, and to Green Street; the occasional visits elsewhere had seemed to him as necessary to health as sea air on weekdays. Even since his migration to Mapledurham he had maintained those habits until--he had known Annette.|$|E
6000|$|I rise to protest. I {{have kept}} still for years; but really I {{think there is}} no {{sufficient}} justification for this sort of thing. What do you want to celebrate those people for?--those ancestors of yours of 1620--the Mayflower tribe, I mean. What do you want to celebrate them for? Your pardon: the gentleman at my left assures me that you are not celebrating the Pilgrims themselves, but the landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth rock on the 22d of December. So you are celebrating their landing. Why, the other pretext was thin enough, but this is thinner than ever; the other was tissue, tinfoil, fish-bladder, but this is gold-leaf. Celebrating their lauding! What was there remarkable about it, I would like to know? What can you be thinking of? Why, those Pilgrims had been at sea three or four months. It was the very middle of winter: it was as cold as death off Cape Cod there. Why shouldn't they come ashore? If they hadn't landed there would be some reason for celebrating the fact: It would have been a case of monumental leatherheadedness which the world would not willingly let die. If it had been you, gentlemen, you probably wouldn't have landed, but you have no shadow of right to be celebrating, in your ancestors, gifts which they did not exercise, but only transmitted. Why, to be celebrating the mere landing of the Pilgrims--to be trying to make out that this most natural and simple and <b>customary</b> <b>procedure</b> was an extraordinary circumstance--a circumstance to be amazed at, and admired, aggrandized and glorified, at orgies like this for two hundred and sixty years--hang it, a horse would have known enough to land; a horse--Pardon again; the gentleman on my right assures me that it was not merely the landing of the Pilgrims that we are celebrating, but the Pilgrims themselves. So we have struck an inconsistency here--one says it was the landing, the other says it was the Pilgrims. It is an inconsistency characteristic of your intractable and disputatious tribe, for you never agree about anything but Boston. Well, then, {{what do you want to}} celebrate those Pilgrims for? They were a mighty hard lot--you know it. I grant you, without the slightest unwillingness, that they were a deal more gentle and merciful and just than were the people of Europe of that day; I grant you that they are better than their predecessors. But what of that?--that is nothing. People always progress. You are better than your fathers and grandfathers were (this is the first time I have ever aimed a measureless slander at the departed, for I consider such things improper). Yes, those among you who have not been in the penitentiary, if such there be, are better than your fathers and grandfathers were; but is that any sufficient reason, for getting up annual dinners and celebrating you? No, by no means--by no means. Well, I repeat, those Pilgrims were a hard lot. They took good care of themselves, but they abolished everybody else's ancestors. I am a border-ruffian from the State of Missouri. I am a Connecticut Yankee by adoption. In me, you have Missouri morals, Connecticut culture; this, gentlemen, is the combination which makes the perfect man. But where are my ancestors? Whom shall I celebrate? Where shall I find the raw material? ...|$|E

50|$|Alcorn's estrangement from Senator Adelbert Ames, his northern-born colleague, deepened in 1871, as African-Americans became {{convinced}} that the former governor was not taking the problem of white terrorism seriously enough; and, in fact, Alcorn resisted Federal action to suppress the Ku Klux Klan, contending that state authorities were sufficient to handle the task. By 1873 the quarrel had deepened into an intense animosity. Both men ran for governor. Ames {{was supported by the}} Radicals and most African Americans, while Alcorn won the votes of conservative whites and most of the scalawags. Ames won by a vote of 69,870 to 50,490. Alcorn withdrew from active politics in the state, emerging to assail the new governor as incapable and an enemy of the people of Mississippi. This was not true, but then, neither was Ames' view of Alcorn as an insincere and possibly corrupt man. When a second African-American Senator, Blanche K. Bruce, was elected in 1874, Alcorn refused to follow the <b>customary</b> <b>procedure</b> of introducing his new colleague to the Senate.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} methods for testing {{the existence of}} a cointegration relationship among the components of a nonstationary fractionally integrated (NFI) vector time series. Our framework generalizes previous studies restricted to unit root integrated processes and permits simultaneous analysis of spurious and cointegrated NFI vectors. We propose a modified F-statistic, based on a particular studentization, which converges weakly under both hypotheses, despite the fact that OLS estimates are only consistent under cointegration. This statistic leads to a Wald-type test of cointegration when combined with a narrow band GLS-type estimate. Our semiparametric methodology allows consistent testing of the spurious regression hypothesis against the alternative of fractional cointegration without prior knowledge on the memory of the original series, their short run properties, the cointegrating vector, or the degree of cointegration. This semiparametric aspect of the modelization does not lead to an asymptotic loss of power, permitting the Wald statistic to diverge faster under the alternative of cointegration than when testing for a hypothesized cointegration vector. In our simulations we show that the method has comparable power to <b>customary</b> <b>procedures</b> under the unit root cointegration setup, and maintains good properties in a general framework where other methods may fail.
