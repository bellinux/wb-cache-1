5|$|Manitoba's economy {{relies heavily}} on agriculture, tourism, energy, oil, mining, and forestry. Agriculture is vital and is found mostly in the {{southern}} half of the province, although grain farming occurs {{as far north as}} The Pas. Around 12 percent of Canadian farmland is in Manitoba. The most common type of farm found in rural areas is <b>cattle</b> <b>farming</b> (34.6%), followed by assorted grains (19.0%) and oilseed (7.9%).|$|E

Welsh beef has a European Union Protected Geographical Indicator, so it must be wholly reared and slaughtered in Wales.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{has been carried out}} to study and evaluate application of technical management (reproduction, feeding, and daily management) on various small holders dairy Farm scales in Garut regency, West Java. This research used the survey method, and the number of respondent was 82 small holder dairy farms which were divided into 37 respondents on the first dairy <b>cattle</b> <b>farm</b> scales with the ownership of 1 - 3 cows, 33 respondents on second dairy <b>cattle</b> <b>farm</b> scales with the ownership of 4 - 6 cows, and 12 respondents on the third dairy <b>cattle</b> <b>farm</b> scales with the ownership of > 7 cows. Simple random sampling was used for taking the respondents of smallholder dairy farm. Data were statistically analyzed using the Duncan method of one way ANOVA. The results of this research showed that: (1) Milk yields average on the third dairy <b>cattle</b> <b>farm</b> scale were same as the second and the third dairy <b>cattle</b> <b>farm</b> scales (13. 98 vs. 13. 91 vs. 13. 32 kg) respectively, (2) Farm management level was highest on the third dairy <b>cattle</b> <b>farm</b> scale than both the second and the first dairy <b>cattle</b> <b>farm</b> scales.

Improvements that could be recommended include : an appropriate tropical housing, energy rich feeding and more frequent feeding. Funthermore existing dairy <b>cattle</b> <b>farms</b> in the district should be replaced by dairy types that are resistence to warm environment. Sufficient feed availability and relatively high price of milk should be an optimum condition to enchance dairy cattle development in the said region.

5|$|The Gangavadi region {{consisted}} of the malnad region, the plains (Bayaluseemae) and the semi-malnad with lower elevation and rolling hills. The main crops of the malnad region were paddy, betel leaves, cardamom and pepper and the semi-malnad region with its lower altitude produced rice, millets such as ragi and corn, pulses, oilseeds {{and it was also}} the base for <b>cattle</b> <b>farming.</b> The plains to the east were the flat lands fed by Kaveri, Tungabhadra and Vedavati rivers where cultivations of sugarcane, paddy, coconut, areca nut (adeka totta), betel leaves, plantain and flowers (vara vana) were common. Sources of irrigation were excavated tanks, wells, natural ponds and water bodies in the catchment area of dams (Katta).

40|$|In many {{tropical}} <b>cattle</b> <b>farms</b> of Central America, farmers commonly retain {{trees in}} pastures to obtain timber and provide shade and fodder to cattle. However, {{little is known}} about the diversity, abundance, richness and species composition of dispersed trees in pastures of <b>cattle</b> <b>farms</b> in the dry tropics. Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterize and describe the pattern of tree cover dispersed in pastures of <b>cattle</b> <b>farm</b> systems assessing their roles in sustaining farm productivity. The study was conducted in 16 <b>cattle</b> <b>farms</b> in a tropical dry ecosystem in Costa Rica. A total of 5, 896 trees, from 36 families and 99 species, were found dispersed in pastures (836 ha). Trees were present on 100 % of the farms and in 85 % of pastures and they occurred as individual trees (54 %) and clustered (46 %).

40|$|Objective—To {{identify}} {{major environmental}} and farm management {{factors associated with}} the occurrence of tuberculosis (TB) on <b>cattle</b> <b>farms</b> in northeastern Michigan. Design—Case-control study. Sample Population— 17 <b>cattle</b> <b>farms</b> with infected <b>cattle</b> and 51 control farms. Procedure—Each case farm (laboratory confirmed diagnosis of Mycobacterium bovis infection) was matched with 2 to 4 control farms (negative whole-herd test results within previous 12 months) {{on the basis of}} type of farm (dairy or beef) and location. <b>Cattle</b> <b>farm</b> data were collected from in-person interviews and mailed questionnaires. Wildlife TB data were gathered through state wildlife surveillance. Environmental data were gathered from a satellite image-based geographic information system. Multivariable conditional logistic regression for matched analysis was performed. Results—Major factors associated with increased farm risk of TB were higher TB prevalence among wild deer and <b>cattle</b> <b>farms</b> in the area, herd size, and ponds or creeks in cattle housing areas. Factors associated with reduced farm risk of TB were greater amounts of natural open lands in the surrounding area and reducing deer access to cattle housing areas by housing cattle in barns, barnyards, or feedlots and use of electrified wire or barbed wire for livestock fencing. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Results suggest that certain environmental and management factors may be associated with risk of TB on <b>cattle</b> <b>farms...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{economy is}} mostly {{agricultural}} (grapes, honey, wool, meat and grain). Traditionally, sheep grazing {{has been the}} key element in agriculture on the Island, however in recent times, more diverse crops, such as potatoes and canola have been introduced. <b>Cattle</b> <b>farming</b> has grown as well, with good quality beef cattle being grown in the higher rainfall areas. Tourism and fishing also play significant roles, with the island experiencing over 186,000 visitors per annum, {{and some of the}} best southern rock lobster being sourced from the island's rugged south coast.

The Westray Development Trust is well known for its renewable energy and recycling initiatives and plans to make the island self-sufficient in energy by 2012. A 900kW community-owned wind turbine was erected in October 2009, the third large-scale such project in Scotland. “When the community realised it was their turbine, not someone else’s, there was no objection,” stated Alasdair McVicar of Westray Renewable Energy.|$|E
25|$|Following the Mexican Cession of California {{at the end}} of the Mexican–American War {{the owners}} of Rancho Laguna de La Merced tried to claim land between San Bruno Mountain and Lake Merced. An 1853 US {{government}} survey declared that the contested area was in fact government property and could be acquired by private citizens. There was a brief land rush as settlers, mainly Irish established ranches and farms in parts of what is now the neighborhoods of Westlake, Serramonte, and the cities of Colma and Pacifica. A decade later, several families left as increase in the fog density killed grain and potato crops. The few remaining families switched to dairy and <b>cattle</b> <b>farming</b> as a more profitable enterprise. In the late 19th century as San Francisco grew and San Mateo County was established, Daly City also gradually grew including homes and schools along the lines for the Southern Pacific railroad. Daly City served as a location where San Franciscans would cross over county lines to gamble and fight. As tensions built in approach to the American Civil War, California was divided between pro-slavery, and Free Soil advocates. Two of the main figures in the debate were US Senator David C. Broderick, a Free Soil advocate and David S. Terry who was in favor of extension of slavery into California. Quarreling and political fighting between the two eventually led to a duel in the Lake Merced area at which Terry mortally wounded Broderick, who would die three days later. The site of the duel is marked with two granite shafts were the men stood, and designated is California Historical Landmark number 19.|$|E
