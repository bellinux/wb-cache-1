5|$|Like all jumping spiders, P. schultzi {{can take}} in only a small visual field at one time, as the most acute part of a main eye <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>all</b> of a circle up to 12millimeters wide at 20centimeters away, or up to 18millimeters wide at 30centimeters away. A Portia spider takes a {{relatively}} long time to see objects, possibly because getting a good image out of such tiny eyes is a complex process and {{needs a lot of}} scanning. This makes a Portia vulnerable to much larger predators such as birds, frogs, and mantises, which it often cannot identify because of the other predator's size.|$|E
25|$|The {{award is}} {{annually}} {{given to the}} LCBL player with the most distinguished pitching season, regardless of role. This is solely determined by Pitcher Rating, a statistical equation created by Ross Clites in 2010. The formula takes into consideration individual winning percentage, saves (if any), strikeouts, ERA, WHIP, and a pitcher's run support average per start. It takes the subjectivity out of performances that only come around once a week. This is especially essential for pitchers in a summer league, where there's not a sample size of 30+ games and 100+ at-bats to judge. No manager <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>all</b> the starts made by each ace, {{and there is no}} safety net for an off-day. Thus, No voting and highest PR value wins.|$|E

The students in his class are Arianna Belle-Essai, Kendall Flowers, Taylor Gibson, Charlotte Grewal, Isabella Hart, Nolan Striukas, and Akira Yamazaki. Rook and all of the students have school-issued computers, which the students use to communicate between each other in private and public messages.

500|$|Although other spiders {{can also}} jump, salticids {{including}} Portia fimbriata have significantly better vision than other spiders, and their main eyes are more acute in daylight than a cat's and 10times more acute than a dragonfly's. Jumping spiders have eight eyes, the two large {{ones in the}} center-and-front position (the anterior-median eyes, also called [...] "principal eyes") housed in tubes {{in the head and}} [...] providing acute vision. The other six are secondary eyes, positioned along the sides of the carapace and acting mainly as movement detectors. In most jumping spiders, the middle pair of secondary eyes are very small and have no known function, but those of Portias are relatively large, and function {{as well as those of}} the other secondary eyes. The main eyes focus accurately on an object at distances from approximately 2centimetres to infinity, and in practice can see up to about 75centimetres. Like all jumping spiders, P. labiata can take in only a small visual field at one time, as the most acute part of a main eye <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>all</b> of a circle up to 12millimetres wide at 20centimetres away, or up to 18millimetres wide at 30centimetres away.

500|$|Despite many {{requests}} from Rail, WCRC chairman David Smith {{refused to comment}} on the incident. In an interview with Steam Railway, [...] he stated that the company was working to satisfy the seven demands made by Network Rail, and was only cancelling trains about a week in advance, in the hope that WCRC would be able to run trains again in the future. Responding to a comment by Smith that [...] "We are co-operating with the ORR in its enquiries, but from what we <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> <b>all</b> it is doing is keeping a watchful eye on what is going on", Rail editor Nigel Harris expressed astonishment at the [...] "jaw-dropping" [...] comments as criminal charges could lead to imprisonment following a guilty verdict. The reputational damage to WCRC was described as [...] "possibly commercially fatal". Rail contributor Pip Dunn said that WCRC refused to talk to journalists when negative stories concerning the company were being reported, yet was happy to when publicising a charter it was running. On 28 May, WCRC issued a press release apologising for the distress, disappointment and inconvenience caused by the incident and events arising from it. It also thanked the ORR and others for assistance and support given. It stated that it was giving full assistance to the RAIB in respect of its investigation into the SPAD.|$|E

Among the ancient Gallifreyans are time-sensitives, marked by their red hair, who pilot early Gallifreyan time machines. Rassilon is rumoured to have been one of these time pilots, who are known as Heroes (as much a title as a term of adulation). Rassilon, as a scientist, opposes the religious and monarchical power wielded by the Pythia.|$|E

2500|$|Passenger {{services}} {{are provided by}} Chiltern Railways. From Marylebone to Neasden Junction the track is shared with the Chiltern Main Line and from Harrow to Amersham the track is shared with London Underground's Metropolitan line, and is used by their [...] "fast" [...] services. As a result, all Chiltern trains must be fitted with the tripcock braking system to run on Underground lines. Marylebone Signalling Control Centre controls all the signals on the line between Marylebone and south of Harrow, and also from north of Amersham to Aylesbury. Marylebone <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>all</b> train movements throughout the line but does not control the signals on the Metropolitan line section. These are operated by London Underground signal cabins at Harrow, Rickmansworth and Amersham. The Network Rail-controlled section of the line is fully equipped with ATP, one of three lines in Britain to have this (the others being the Chiltern Main Line and the Great Western Main Line). As a result, all Chiltern trains must be equipped with ATP equipment.|$|E

2500|$|Huxley argued {{his case}} many times, {{even in his}} most {{important}} works. In the final chapter of his Evolution the modern synthesis he defines evolutionary progress as [...] "a raising of the upper level of biological efficiency, this being defined as increased control over and independence of the environment," [...] Evolution in action discusses evolutionary progress at length: [...] "Natural selection plus time produces biological improvement… 'Improvement' {{is not yet a}} recognised technical term in biology … however, living things are improved during evolution… Darwin was not afraid to use the word for the results of natural selection in general… I believe that improvement can become one of the key concepts in evolutionary biology.""Can it be scientifically defined? Improvements in biological machinery… the limbs and teeth of grazing horses… the increase in brain-power… The eyes of a dragon-fly, which <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>all</b> round [...] in every direction, are an improvement over the mere microscopic eye-spots of early forms of life." [...] " [...] the whole range of evolutionary time we see general advance—improvement in all the main properties of life, including its general organization. 'Advance' is thus a useful term for long-term improvement in some general property of life. [...] improvement is not universal. Lower forms manage to survive alongside higher". These excerpts are much abbreviated, but give some idea of his way of thinking. He addresses the topic of 'persistent types' (living fossils) later in the same book (pp 126–28).|$|E

2500|$|For Kierkegaard's author, Vigilius Haufniensis, anxiety/dread/angst (depending on the {{translation}} and context) is unfocused fear. Haufniensis uses {{the example of}} a man standing {{on the edge of a}} tall building or cliff. From this height he <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>all</b> the possibilities of life. He's reflecting on what he could become if he only threw himself into the power of his own choice. As long as he stands there he stands at the crossroads of life, unable to make a decision and live within its boundaries. The mere fact that one has the possibility and freedom to do something, even the most terrifying of possibilities, triggers immense feelings of dread. Haufniensis called this our [...] "dizziness of freedom."Anxiety may be compared with dizziness. He whose eye happens to look down into the yawning abyss becomes dizzy. But what is the reason for this? It is just as much in his own eye as in the abyss, for suppose he had not looked down. Hence, anxiety is the dizziness of freedom, which emerges when the spirit wants to [...] the synthesis and freedom looks down into its own possibility, laying hold of finiteness to support itself. Freedom succumbs to dizziness. Further than this, psychology cannot and will not go. In that very moment everything is changed, and freedom, when it again rises, sees that it is guilty. Between these two moments lies the leap, which no science has explained and which no science can explain. He who becomes guilty in anxiety becomes as ambiguously guilty as it is possible to become.
