25|$|The Glock's frame, {{magazine}} body, {{and several}} other components are made from a high-strength nylon-based polymer invented by Gaston Glock, called Polymer 2. This plastic was specially formulated to provide increased durability and is more resilient than carbon steel and most steel alloys. Polymer 2 is resistant to shock, caustic liquids, and temperature extremes where traditional steel/alloy frames would warp and become brittle. The injection-molded frame contains four hardened steel guide rails for the slide: two {{at the rear of}} the frame, and the remaining pair above and in front of the trigger guard. The trigger guard itself is squared off at the front and checkered. The grip has an angle of 109° and a nonslip, stippled surface on the sides and both the front and rear straps. The frame houses the locking block, which is an investment casting that engages a 45° <b>camming</b> surface on the barrel's lower <b>camming</b> lug. It is retained in the frame by a steel axis pin that holds the trigger and slide catch. The trigger housing is held to the frame by means of a polymer pin. A spring-loaded sheet-metal pressing serves as the slide catch, which is secured from unintentional manipulation by a raised guard molded into the frame.|$|E
25|$|When a {{cartridge}} is fired, {{the internal}} pressure expands {{the case to}} fit the chamber in a process called obturation. To allow ease of chambering the cartridge when it is reloaded, the case is swaged back to size. Competition shooters, using bolt action rifles {{that are capable of}} <b>camming</b> a tight case into place, often resize only the neck of the cartridge, called neck sizing, as opposed to the normal full length resizing process. Neck sizing is only useful for cartridges to be re-fired in the same firearm, as the brass may be slightly oversized in some dimensions for other chambers, but the precise fit of case to chamber will allow greater consistency and therefore greater potential accuracy. Some believe that neck sizing will permit a larger number of reloads with a given case in contrast to full size resizing, although this is controversial. Semi-automatic rifles and rifles with SAAMI minimum chamber dimensions often require a special small base resizing die, that sizes further down the case than normal dies, and allows for more reliable feeding.|$|E
25|$|The Desert Eagle uses a gas-operated {{mechanism}} normally {{found in}} rifles, {{as opposed to}} the short recoil or blow-back designs most commonly seen in semi-automatic pistols. When a round is fired, gases are ported out through a small hole in the barrel near the breech. These travel forward through a small tube under the barrel, to a cylinder near the front of the barrel. The slide which acts as the bolt carrier has a small piston on the front that fits into this cylinder. When the gases reach the cylinder they push the piston rearward. The slide rides rearward on two rails {{on either side of the}} barrel, both with action springs around them, with a large pin inside the <b>camming</b> surface in the rear of the bolt that causes the bolt to rotate and unlock. A cylindrical mechanism on the left side of the bolt, called the bolt stabilizer assembly, prevents the bolt from rotating freely as the slide moves, enabling it to align correctly with the barrel again as the slide moves it forward. The spring loaded ejector pin is continually being depressed by the case, until the case is free of the chamber and releases tension from the ejector, causing the case to fly out, becoming released from the extractor claw in the process. The slide reaches its rear-most travel, then rides forward again under tension of the springs around the slide rails, the bottom lug of the bolt pushes a new round into the chamber, then the bolt locks up and the gun can be fired again once the trigger is released.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Examine {{stability}} {{of use of}} complementary and alternative medicine (<b>CAM)</b> of breast cancer patients, reasons for <b>CAM</b> use, and sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological predictors of <b>CAM</b> use. Methods: <b>CAM</b> use was assessed after adjuvant therapy and six months later. Following the <b>CAM</b> Healthcare Model, <b>CAM</b> use was divided into use of provider-directed (guided) and self-directed (self-help) <b>CAM.</b> Stability and reasons for <b>CAM</b> use were examined with McNemar's tests and descriptive statistics. Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between predictors and <b>CAM</b> use were examined with univariate and multivariate logistical analyses. Results: Use of provider-directed and self-directed <b>CAM</b> was stable over time (N = 176). Self-directed <b>CAM</b> was more often used to influence the course of cancer than provider-directed <b>CAM.</b> Both were used to influence well-being. Openness to experience predicted use of provider-directed <b>CAM,</b> while clinical distress predicted use of self-directed <b>CAM,</b> after adjusting for other predictors. Perceived control did not predict <b>CAM</b> use. Conclusion: <b>CAM</b> use is stable over time. It is meaningful to distinguish provider-directed from self-directed <b>CAM.</b> Practice implications: Providers are advised to plan a 'CAM-talk' before adjuvant therapy, and discuss patients' expectations about influence of <b>CAM</b> on the course of cancer.

2500|$|The Glock 17 is a 9 mm short recoil–operated, locked-breech {{semi-automatic}} pistol {{that uses}} a modified Browning cam-lock system adapted from the Hi-Power pistol. The firearm's locking mechanism uses a linkless, vertically tilting barrel with a rectangular breech that locks into the ejection port cut-out in the slide. During the recoil stroke, the barrel moves rearward initially locked together with the slide about [...] until the bullet leaves the barrel and chamber pressure drops to a safe level. A ramped lug extension {{at the base of}} the barrel then interacts with a tapered locking block integrated into the frame, forcing the barrel down and unlocking it from the slide. This <b>camming</b> action terminates the barrel's movement while the slide continues back under recoil, extracting and ejecting the spent cartridge casing. The slide's uninterrupted rearward movement and counter-recoil cycle are characteristic of the Browning system.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{many other}} {{military}} rifles of the day, the Lee was not {{fitted with a}} turning bolt. [...] Though frequently described as a straight-pull action, the M1895 Lee actually uses a <b>camming</b> action in which a steel wedge or locking block beneath the bolt is forced into a recessed area in the receiver. [...] Pulling the operating handle back causes the bolt to rock back and upwards, freeing a locking stud on the receiver and unlocking the bolt. [...] The firing pin cocked on final closing where the resistance would be overcome by the forward inertia of closing the action. [...] Once the rather odd [...] "up and back" [...] bolt movement was mastered, {{and as long as}} the action was clean and well-lubricated, it worked fairly well, though the slightly inclined opening stroke proved awkward for some men when the rifle was operated from the shoulder. [...] Despite this, the Navy's Chief of Ordnance noted with approval that the Lee rifle could be fired [...] "with great rapidity", achieving a rate of fire considerably faster than most existing turn-bolt rifles of the day.|$|E
2500|$|Most climbers {{choose to}} wear {{specialized}} rubber climbing shoes {{which are often}} of a smaller size than their normal street shoes {{in order to improve}} sensitivity towards foot placements and use the tightness to their advantage. [...] Climbing chalk (MgCO3) is commonly used as a drying agent to minimize sweating of the hands. Most other equipment is of a protective nature. Rock climbing is inherently dangerous, so to minimize the potential consequences resulting from a fall, climbers use protection. The most basic protective equipment is a climbing rope. Climbing [...] would attach the rope to themselves; {{in the event of a}} fall, the rope would usually cause injury to the climber in the hope that it prevented death. With advances in technology came the development of specialized harnesses, carabiners which are used for clipping into belay and rappel anchors and connecting gear, and belay devices which are used to catch a falling climber, hold or lower a climber and for rappelling. Eventually, the placement of bolts with the use of quickdraws led to the rise of sport climbing. Traditional climbers developed the spring-loaded <b>camming</b> device, which increased safety over chocks, hexes, and pitons. Some climbers choose to wear a specialized climbing helmet to protect them from falling rocks or equipment or head injuries from crashing into rocks.|$|E

2500|$|Bottleneck rifle {{cartridges}} {{are particularly}} prone to encounter incipient head separations {{if they are}} full-length re-sized and re-trimmed to their maximum permitted case lengths each time they are reloaded. [...] In some such cartridges, such as the [...]303 British when used in Enfield rifles, as few as 1 or 2 re-loadings can be the limit, before {{the head of the}} cartridge will physically separate from the body of the cartridge when fired. [...] The solution to this problem, of avoiding overstretching of the brass case, and thereby avoiding the excessive thinning of the wall thickness of the brass case due to case stretching, is to use what is called a [...] "head space gauge". [...] Contrary to its name, it does not actually measure a rifle's headspace. [...] Rather, it measures the distance from the head of the cartridge {{to the middle of the}} shoulder of the bottleneck cartridge case. [...] For semi-automatic and automatic rifles, customary practice is to move the midpoint of this shoulder back by no more than 0.005 inches, for reliable operation, when resizing the case. [...] For bolt-action rifles, with their additional <b>camming</b> action, customary practice is to move this shoulder back by only 0.001 to 0.002 inches when resizing the case. [...] In contrast to full-length resizing of bottleneck rifle cartridges, which can rapidly thin out the wall thickness of bottleneck rifle cartridges due to case stretching that occurs each time when fired, partial length re-sizing of the bottleneck case that pushes shoulders back only a few thousandths of an inch will often permit a case to be safely reloaded 5 times or more, even up to 10 times, or more for very light loads.|$|E
2500|$|With bottlenecked {{cartridge}} cases, {{choosing the}} right sizing die can also be important. Full length sizing of cartridges is often thought to greatly shorten case life by work hardening {{the full length of}} the case, which can cause the case neck to split, although some studies show that the number of reloads possible with a case is essentially the same for either full length sizing as for neck sizing only if the issue is one of neck hardening. If the reloaded cartridges are going {{to be used in the}} same firearm in which they were previously fired, though, and if that firearm has a bolt action or other action with a strong <b>camming</b> action on closing, then full length resizing may not be needed. A collet neck sizing die can be used to size just the case neck enough to hold the bullet, and leave the rest of the case unsized. The resulting cartridge will chamber into the specific rifle that previously fired it, though the fit might be tight and require more force to chamber than a full length resized case. The use of a neck-sizing die in conjunction with moderate pressure loads may extend the life of the case significantly by minimizing the amount of case that is work hardened or stretched. This is especially true for reloads intended for military rifles with intentionally large chambers such as the Lee–Enfield in [...]303 British. [...] The use of partial length or neck sizing for cartridges used in such large chambers permits effectively switching the headspacing from relying on the rim of a rimmed cartridge to the shoulder of the bottle neck transition instead, increasing the number of times a rimmed military cartridge can be reloaded from once to perhaps 5 or more times, all while avoiding dangerous incipient head separations. [...] One final form of limiting case wear is, unfortunately, limited strictly to benchrest shooters with custom-cut chambers. The chamber of these rifles is cut so that there is just enough room, typically just a few thousandths of an inch, in the neck area. [...] The result of using this type of chamber is that fired rounds don't require any resizing whatsoever once the case is fired. [...] The brass will 'spring back' a bit after firing, and will properly hold a new bullet without further manipulation. Some refer to this as a 'fitted' neck, however it is a function of both the carefully cut precision neck and the case adjusted to fit with very little clearance.|$|E
