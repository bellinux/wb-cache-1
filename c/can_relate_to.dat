The Simons Foundation is an organization founded by Jim Simons and his wife Marilyn, and has awarded $130 million for autism research as of 2008. As scientific director, Fischbach collaborates with mathematicians, engineers, chemists, and neuroscientists to try and understand autism more completely.

25|$|Children {{learn about}} {{different}} gender categories by observing {{various forms of}} media. They often look for gender roles, with whom they <b>can</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to,</b> from books and television. Conversely, these sources of media will also stereotypically shape a child’s understanding for gender acceptable behaviors. Studies examining the effects of gender stereotyping in children’s literature describe that, most often than not, gender views are affiliated with stereotypes which are both culturally and individually constructed. In children’s literature, male characters {{appear to be more}} central as well as less emotional and stronger. Female characters on the other hand worked out their feelings through expression, they are more dependent and usually adopt the roles of more domesticated characters.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, {{school fees}} for grades 1 to 10 were officially {{abolished}} but hidden costs remained. Other costs include loss of children's wages or unpaid labour for agriculture, tending livestock or housework. Whether children work depends on relative household wealth. Labour-intensive assets such as farms can hire labour if they generate sufficient profit but poorer households may need {{their children to}} help with these assets. This <b>can</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> family size, with larger families sending their younger children to school because older children can help their parents. Attendance is reduced when children have to travel long distances to school since this increases personal risk and transport costs. There are also cultural attitudes against educating girls since education will only benefit her husband's household.|$|E

25|$|Analyzing {{aggression}} culturally or politically {{is complicated}} by the fact that the label 'aggressive' can itself be used as a way of asserting a judgement from a particular point of view. Whether a coercive or violent method of social control is perceived as aggression– or as legitimate versus illegitimate aggression– depends on the position of the relevant parties in relation to the social order of their culture. This in turn <b>can</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> factors such as: norms for coordinating actions and dividing resources; what is considered self-defense or provocation; attitudes towards 'outsiders', attitudes towards specific groups such as women, the disabled or the lower status; the availability of alternative conflict resolution strategies; trade interdependence and collective security pacts; fears and impulses; and ultimate goals regarding material and social outcomes.|$|E
25|$|The Canadian Charter {{has little}} to say, {{explicitly}} at least, about economic and social rights. On this point, it stands in marked contrast with the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms and with the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. There are some who feel economic rights ought to be read into section 7 rights to security of the person and section 15 equality rights to make the Charter similar to the Covenant. The rationale is that economic rights <b>can</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> a decent standard of living and can help the civil rights flourish in a livable environment. Canadian courts, however, have been hesitant in this area, stating that economic rights are political questions and adding that as positive rights, economic rights are of questionable legitimacy.|$|E
25|$|Among Native Hawaiians, {{the goal}} of {{learning}} is to transform participation to encompass conscientious accountability as active contributing members of the community, like that found in LOPI. For example, in some Native Hawaiian communities, parent(s) teach the older siblings the necessary skills of care taking. Sibling care-taking skills <b>can</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> Indigenous American ways of learning by the children becoming considerate of their parents and taking on the responsibility when needed {{in case of a}} tragic incident with the parents. Within the classroom and home settings, adults are present but are not always directly monitoring the children. Children ask for help when necessary, but adults appear to rarely interject. Children appeared to adapt to tasks and situations by observations and go off on their own to collectively work out how and what to do to complete the task.|$|E

25|$|Filipino American Theater {{ranges from}} {{topics such as}} Filipino/Filipino-American history to modern Filipino issues. The themes for these works were mostly {{influenced}} by the Spanish colonial rule {{as well as the}} American colonization. Filipino theater is not only made up of colonial influences but also pre-colonial and post-colonial influences which gives the audience {{a better understanding of the}} effects of the colonialism within the country. Contemporary issues are also a huge trend within the community since the audience <b>can</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> it more. Some common theatrical plays done by Filipino theater focuses on the historical background of the Philippines and the relationship between the Philippines and the United States. Some Filipino American productions provides personal, societal and cultural perspective from the past to now. The history of the Filipino American theater starts with indigenous tribes and their rituals then the colonization of Spain and their influences which then leads to the influences of the Filipino American War. Filipino American productions ranges from original playwrights to adaptations being done in the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|Social {{networks}} {{are beginning to}} be adopted by healthcare professionals {{as a means to}} manage institutional knowledge, disseminate peer to peer knowledge and to highlight individual physicians and institutions. The advantage of using a dedicated medical social networking site is that all the members are screened against the state licensing board list of practitioners. A new trend is emerging with social networks created to help its members with various physical and mental ailments. For people suffering from life altering diseases, PatientsLikeMe offers its members the chance to connect with others dealing with similar issues and research patient data related to their condition. For alcoholics and addicts, SoberCircle gives people in recovery the ability to communicate with one another and strengthen their recovery through the encouragement of others who <b>can</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> their situation. DailyStrength is also a website that offers support groups for a wide array of topics and conditions, including the support topics offered by PatientsLikeMe and SoberCircle. Some social networks aim to encourage healthy lifestyles in their users. SparkPeople offers community and social networking tools for peer support during weight loss. Fitocracy and QUENTIQ are focused on exercise, enabling users to share their own workouts and comment on those of other users.|$|E
