500|$|The {{first version}} of [...] "Human Nature" [...] was written and {{composed}} for Michael Jackson by Steve Porcaro of Toto. Porcaro recorded a rough demo of the song on a cassette. He had written the song after his first-grade daughter came home <b>crying</b> <b>because</b> a boy pushed her off the slide. He blurted out three reasons for the incident to comfort her: one, the boy liked her, two, people can be strange and three, it's human nature. Fellow Toto band member David Paich gave the demo tape, along {{with two of his}} own songs, to producer Quincy Jones, hoping they would be used by Jackson. Jones did not think Paich's songs were right for Jackson's current work, but enjoyed the rough demo of [...] "Human Nature" [...] {{at the end of the}} cassette. Jones explained, [...] "All of a sudden, at the end, there was all this silence, there was: 'why, why, dah dah da-dum dah dah, why, why'. Just a dummy lyric and a very skeletal thing—I get goosebumps talking about it. I said, 'This is where we wanna go, because it's got such a wonderful flavor'". However, Jones was dissatisfied with the original lyrics and so John Bettis, who had written lyrics for hits by the Carpenters and the Pointer Sisters, among others, was asked to add lyrics to the song. He completed the song in two days. The producer asked if the song could be included on Jackson's album, to which Porcaro and Bettis agreed. [...] "Human Nature" [...] was the last song selected for Thriller, ousting [...] "Carousel" [...] from the final track listing.|$|E
