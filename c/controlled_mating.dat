40|$|ABSTRACT- Social parasites exhibit several {{characteristics}} {{that allow them}} to exploit their host species efficiently. The smaller size of parasite species is a trait commonly found in ants. In this work, we investigated several aspects of the reproductive biology of Acromyrmex ameliae De Souza, Soares & Della Lucia, a recently discovered parasite of Acromyrmex subterraneus subterraneus Forel. Sexuals of A. ameliae are substantially smaller than those from host species. Parasite queens laid significantly less worker eggs than host queens and inhibit sexual production of the host. The sex ratio of parasite species is highly female biased. Interestingly, we have observed parasite coupling on the laboratory, inside the nests and in the ground, opening the possibility to use <b>controlled</b> <b>mating</b> to study genetic approaches of parasitism in the ants.

Whereas Uriankhai households and the wealthier Torguud herders pursued a quick re-stocking of herds, small-scale Kazakh herders abandoned livestock-keeping. For a majority of herders, local ecological knowledge of predicting harsh winters and taking precautions against such disaster gained importance only after the 2009 / 10 dzud. Therefore, priority was given to hay-making and winter pen preparation, whereas improvement of livestock productivity through segregated grazing (otor) of selected animals, frequent pastureland rotation of the main herd, <b>controlled</b> <b>mating</b> and early sale of fattened as well as skinny livestock were sometimes mentioned but hardly practiced. Since animals that enter the winter season in healthy and well-fed condition are more resistant against disaster than lean animals, national and international organizations wishing to support livestock keepers in this and similar regions should highlight the relevance of these local approaches. However, labour investments in refined herding strategies, hay-making and winter pen preparation can be substantial and surpass the capacities of individual households.

40|$|Risk {{assessment}} {{is a fundamental}} component of any decision-making process, including mate choice. For males, one element of risk that is rarely considered is that a female mate may not survive to offspring independence, resulting in total reproductive failure. This element of risk could be particularly important in short-lived species where all individuals, regardless of condition, attempt to reproduce, and developing mature eggs is a time and energetically expensive process during which females {{are at risk of}} predation, starvation, and disease. I evaluate whether males use female survival probability as a mate choice criterion in the golden orb-web spider Nephila clavipes by assessing how male reproductive investment changes depending on female proximity to oviposition. Using a field experiment and a <b>controlled</b> <b>mating</b> experiment, I show that males mate at higher frequencies, transfer more sperm, and father more offspring in the first clutch when mated with nonvirgin females close to oviposition compared with younger nonvirgin females. Furthermore, females close to oviposition have a lower probability of mortality prior to egg deposition compared with virgin females and young nonvirgin adult females. These findings support the hypothesis that males invest more reproductive effort as a female approaches oviposition, possibly because these females are a low-risk mating investment.

40|$|While {{extensive}} population genetic theory predicts conditions favoring {{evolution of}} self-fertilization versus outcrossing, {{there is no}} analogous theory that predicts conditions favoring evolution of inbreeding avoidance or inbreeding preference enacted through mate choice given obligate biparental reproduction.

We incorporated these processes into an individual-based model to predict conditions where selection should increase or decrease frequencies of alleles causing inbreeding avoidance or inbreeding preference when females or males <b>controlled</b> <b>mating.</b> Selection for inbreeding avoidance occurred given strong inbreeding depression when either sex chose mates, while selection for inbreeding preference occurred given very weak inbreeding depression when females chose but never occurred when males chose.

Structured face-to-face interviews were held in 50 households (HHs), addressing aspects of livestock possession and management as well as disaster prediction and mitigation. The responses disclosed that livestock losses during the 2009 / 10 dzud averaged 112.4 animals per HH, equaling nearly 80 % of the interviewees’ total livestock possession in summer 2013. To reduce such high losses in the future, herders planned to improve their hay-making efforts and winter pen preparation. However, they also stated that the earliest signs for a dzud occur in September, when it is already too late for substantial hay-making. Therefore, some herders underlined the necessity of maintaining livestock productivity through segregated summer grazing of specific animal groups, <b>controlled</b> <b>mating</b> and early sale of weak livestock.

In this issue of Cell, two independent studies (Boehm et al., 2005; Yoon et al., 2005) examine the inputs from each of these olfactory pathways to a population of neurons that plays {{a central role in}} mating behavior...|$|R
40|$|Botryotinia fuckeliana (Botrytis cinerea) is a heterothallic ascomycete which {{produces}} linear 8 -spored asci (tetrads) in apothecia. Ascospores {{were collected in}} their linear sequence from individual asci, and analysed to determine the segregation patterns of alleles at gene loci <b>controlling</b> <b>mating</b> type (MAT 1), resistance to dicarboximide fungicides (Daf 1) and resistance to benzimidazole fungicides (Mbc 1). The alleles were present in their expected linear sequence in 58 % of the asci; most irregular sequences (32 % of the asci) were caused by single exchanges between adjacent spores. The MAT 1 locus was ca 12 map units from its centromere, and the Mbc 1 locus showed loose linkage with its centromere. The Mbc 1 and Daf 1 loci were ca 47 map units apart on the same chromosome and not linked with the MAT 1 locus. Pairs of homothallic ascospores were found in seven out of 105 asci. Homothallism was not caused by inclusion {{of more than one}} nucleus in ascospores, and it occurred only in ascospores predicted to carry the MAT 1 - 2 allele after meiosis...|$|R
40|$|Cryptococcus neoformans is an {{opportunistic}} fungal pathogen that infects {{the human}} central nervous system. This pathogen elaborates two specialized virulence factors: the antioxidant melanin and an antiphagocytic immunosuppressive polysaccharide capsule. A signaling cascade <b>controlling</b> <b>mating</b> and virulence was identified. The PKA 1 gene encoding the major cyclic AMP (cAMP) -dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit was identified and disrupted. pka 1 mutant strains were sterile, {{failed to produce}} melanin or capsule, and were avirulent. The PKR 1 gene encoding the protein kinase A (PKA) regulatory subunit was also identified and disrupted. pkr 1 mutant strains overproduced capsule and were hypervirulent in animal models of cryptococcosis. pkr 1 pka 1 double mutant strains exhibited phenotypes {{similar to that of}} pka 1 mutants, providing epistasis evidence that the Pka 1 catalytic subunit functions downstream of the Pkr 1 regulatory subunit. The PKA pathway was also shown to function downstream of the Gα protein Gpa 1 and to regulate cAMP production by feedback inhibition. These findings define a Gα protein-cAMP-PKA signaling pathway regulating differentiation and virulence of a human fungal pathogen...|$|R
