In this paper, we apply a solution concept discussed <b>by</b> <b>Klemperer</b> and Meyer for games in which the strategy space consists {{of the class of}} all (non state-contingent) price quantity schedules. We examine a series of specific assumptions on demand and supply conditions and derive the associated equilibrium trade policies. We derive welfare implications for all cases examined...|$|R

50|$|Built in 1920 {{to attend}} the first Rhön glider contest at Wasserkuppe. Designed by Prof.. Theodore von Kármán and his {{assistant}} Wolfgang Klemperer the FVA-1 was a low-wing cantilever monoplane with twin skid undercarriage. The FVA-1 was constructed of wood, with the pilot sitting exposed {{at the front of}} the fuselage. Piloted <b>by</b> <b>Klemperer,</b> the FVA-1 won the Rhön contest in 1920, with a straight distance flight of 1,830 m. A year later, on ((date | 30 | August | 1921 | Aviation W)) Klemperer sets a world record for distance, running 4.6 kilometers in 13 minutes. One built.|$|R
40|$|In many contexts, {{efficiency}} {{is an important}} consideration in structuring auctions. In this paper, we survey several sources of inefficiency arising in auctions. We Þrst highlight how demand reducing incentives, both in theory and in practice, affect the efficiency of multi-unit auctions. Next, we study inefficiencies arising from interdependence in bidder valuations. Again, we highlight both theoretical insights {{as well as how}} these translate in practice. Finally, we present an impossibility theorem for attaining efficiency in sufficiently rich auction contexts. An auction form suggested <b>by</b> <b>Klemperer</b> is discussed as a means of ameliorating inefficiencies arising in practice...|$|R
50|$|Steinberg {{was born}} Hans Wilhelm Steinberg in Cologne, Germany. He {{displayed}} early talent as a violinist, pianist, and composer, conducting his own choral/ orchestral composition (based on texts from Ovid's Metamorphoses) at age 13. In 1914, he began {{studies at the}} Cologne Conservatory, where his piano teacher was the Clara Schumann pupil Lazzaro Uzielli and his conducting mentor was Hermann Abendroth. He graduated with distinction, winning the Wüllner Prize for conducting, in 1919. He immediately became a second violinist in the Cologne Opera orchestra, but was dismissed from the position <b>by</b> Otto <b>Klemperer</b> for using his own bowings. He was soon hired <b>by</b> <b>Klemperer</b> as an assistant, and in 1922 conducted Fromental Halévy's La Juive as a substitute. When Klemperer left in 1924, Steinberg served as Principal Conductor. He left a year later, in 1925, for Prague, where he was conductor of the German Theater. He next took the position of {{music director of the}} Frankfurt Opera. In 1930, in Frankfurt, he conducted the world premiere of Arnold Schoenberg's Von heute auf morgen.|$|R
40|$|Solitary fi brous tumors (SFT) {{are rare}} mesenchymal neoplasms, {{occurring}} {{mainly in the}} pleural cavity. Since their initial description in the pleura <b>by</b> <b>Klemperer</b> and Rabin 1 in 1931, SFTs {{have been reported in}} nearly every body site. 2 SFTs are generally benign, slow-growing neoplasms and carry a favorable prognoses; however, malignant variants, usually in the pleura, have been reported. 3 - 5 To date, 19 renal SFTs {{have been reported in the}} literature with only 1 reported case of histologically malignant SFT. 6 We report what is, to our knowledge, the fi rst documented case of malignant SFT arising in a renal graft...|$|R

40|$|Primary tumours of serosal {{membranes}} are un-common {{and their}} diagnosis is difficult. Several authorities deny {{that they are}} more than rare curiosities (Willis, 1960; Smart and Hinson, 1957). The pathology of pleural tumours was defined <b>by</b> <b>Klemperer</b> and Rabin (1931), and their general division into localized (usually fibrous) and diffuse (usually epithelial) tumours still obtains. Since Godwin (1957) laid down strict criteria for pleural tumours and Winslow and Taylor (1960) for peri-toneal, the diagnosis of these neoplasms has be-come more common (McCaughey, 1958; Mangui-kian and Prior, 1963). The association between pleural tumours and exposure to asbestos was first noted by Wagner (1960) in South Africa, and this work has been extended subsequently (Wagner...|$|R
50|$|On 10 March 1964, Legge {{announced}} {{that he was going to}} disband the Philharmonia Orchestra. At a recording session with Klemperer, a meeting was convened where those present unanimously agreed that they would not allow the orchestra to be disbanded. Klemperer gave his immediate support. On 17 March 1964, the members of the orchestra elected their own governing body and adopted the name New Philharmonia Orchestra. The inaugural concert of the New Philharmonia under its own auspices took place on 27 October 1964. It was a performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, conducted <b>by</b> <b>Klemperer,</b> who was now honorary president of the orchestra. From 1966 until 1972, the chairman of the orchestra was the principal flautist, Gareth Morris.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} electricity producers {{playing on}} the energy market. We model an oligopoly market facing uncertain demand, where each firm chooses as its strategy a supply function relating quantity to price. Such strategy allows a producer to adapt better to the uncertain environment than either setting a fixed price or a fixed quantity. We apply model of supply function competition in oligopoly under demand uncertainty, developed <b>by</b> <b>Klemperer</b> and Meyer [5]. We assume that the uncertain demand {{is a function of}} the price and the stochastic shock. We describe the shock by PARMA system (periodic ARMA model). Our aim in this paper is to provide as realistic as possible model of oligopolistic competition in single period game. Our belief is that the model we apply better represents oligopoly behaviour than standard Bertrand and Cournot models...|$|R
