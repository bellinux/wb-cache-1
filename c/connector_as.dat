5|$|NY128 {{was first}} {{constructed}} {{during the early}} 1900s {{with a pair of}} contracts handed out by the state of New York, which constructed the new alignment between NY22 and the triangle junction with NY117 in Mount Kisco. These segments were both added into the state highway system in 1903. NY128 itself was designated in the 1930 renumbering of state highways from Armonk to Mount Kisco. This was extended in the mid-1930s to connect to the Connecticut state line at Riversville Road. However, in 1971, the state truncated NY128 back to NY22 in Armonk and renumbered the short <b>connector</b> <b>as</b> NY433.|$|E

25|$|After {{failing to}} take any action for over a decade, and under threat of further lawsuits, the state finally agreed to start {{detailed}} engineering design for such an extension. Construction was expected to take six years, but a start date and funding scheme were never announced. The MBTA ultimately decided not to complete the design work necessary to build the Red/Blue <b>Connector,</b> <b>as</b> funding for constructing it {{was seen as an}} impossibility. The possibility of a public-private partnership (P3) to advance the project was studied in 2013.|$|E
25|$|The {{plugs and sockets}} used {{to power}} {{electric}} stoves from a single-phase line have to be rated for greater current values than ones for three-phase system because all the power has to be transferred through a single line. Electric stoves are often hardwired to the electrical supply system, connected to the mains with an appropriate high power industrial connector or with non-standard high power proprietary domestic <b>connector</b> (<b>as</b> some countries do not have wiring regulations for single-phase electric stoves). In Russia an electric stove can often be seen connected with a 25 to 32A connector.|$|E

25|$|A {{breakout}} dock is conceptually {{a breakout}} {{box in the}} form of a dock. It is an extension to a typical port replicator in that it not only replicates existing ports already on the computer, but also offers additional ports. Modern computers most often accomplish this by using a special, often proprietary, connector that consolidates the signals from many concealed traces from onboard external buses into one <b>connector.</b> <b>As</b> such, the dock can offer a greater number of ports than is physically present on the computer. This allows the basic unit to have fewer physical ports while still allowing users a way to access to the full range of features of its motherboard.|$|E
25|$|At {{one time}} three-pin XLR {{connectors}} {{were also used}} extensively on loudspeaker cables, as when first introduced they represented a new standard of ruggedness, and economic alternatives were not readily available. Often, two-conductor loudspeaker cable had three-pin female connectors on both ends, to distinguish it from a three-conductor shielded signal level cable, which has a female connector {{at one end and}} a male at the other. Either pin 2 or 3 was live, depending on the manufacturer, with pin 1 always the 'earthy' return. This usage is now both obsolete and dangerous to equipment but is still sometimes encountered, especially on older equipment. For example, some loudspeakers have a built-in male <b>connector</b> <b>as</b> an input connector for speaker-level signal. This use was superseded in professional audio applications by the Neutrik Speakon connector.|$|E
25|$|Residents of Massachusetts {{must have}} health {{insurance}} coverage under Chapter 58. Residents must indicate on their tax forms if they had insurance on December 31 of that tax year, had a waiver for religious reasons, or had a waiver from the Connector. The Connector waiver can be obtained if the resident demonstrates {{that there is no}} available coverage that is defined by the <b>Connector</b> <b>as</b> affordable. In March 2007, the Connector adopted an affordability schedule that allows residents to seek a waiver. If a resident does not have coverage and does not have a waiver, the Department of Revenue will enforce the insurance requirement by imposing a penalty. In 2007, the penalty was the loss of the personal exemption. Beginning in 2008, the penalty is half the cost of the lowest available yearly premium which will be enforced as an assessed addition to the individual's income tax.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Connector-Centric Design (XcD) {{is a new}} {{approach}} to specifying software architectures. XcD views complex <b>connectors</b> <b>as</b> highly significant in architectural designs, as it is the complex connectors that non-functional quality properties in systems can emanate from. So, XcD promotes in designs a clean separation of connectors (interaction behaviours) from components (functional behaviours). Designers can then specify connectors in detail explicitly thus easing the analysis of system designs for quality properties. Furthermore, XcD separates control behaviour from <b>connectors</b> <b>as</b> control strategies. Architectural designs in XcD thus become highly modular with re-usable components, connectors, and control strategies (representing design solutions for quality properties). The end result is the eased architectural experimentation with different design solutions by re-using components/connectors and formal analysis of these solutions to find out the optimal ones. ...|$|R

The device had a 0.39 watt-hour battery rated at 3.7 volts, giving a capacity of 105 mAh, and specified to give 24 hours of music playback on a single full charge. The device took about three hours for one full charge. The device retained the same 30-pin dock <b>connector</b> <b>as</b> previous generations. This Nano lost the previous generation's video camera, built-in voice recorder microphone (although plugging in headphones with a built in microphone revealed a Voice Memos app) and built-in speaker, and games. It also lost support for video playback, but music videos and video podcasts (vodcasts) could be synced onto the device, and the audio from them would play on the device, with a single key-frame shown on the screen. It still included the Nike+iPod fitness option as well as an FM radio tuner with RDS (Radio Data System). It had a black on white screen contrast option and other accessibility options. The 6th generation iPod Nano had the same price point as the 5th generation device.|$|E
500|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, gigging musicians were finding that older Leslies like the 122 were not {{loud enough for}} large venues, {{which led to the}} {{introduction}} of the [...] "Pro Line" [...] series. These Leslies had louder solid-state power amplifiers, and were mounted on casters for ease of portability. The first models Leslie manufactured were the 900 and 910, which contained a 100 watt, three-channel power amplifier. Both could split into two sections. The most popular version of the Pro-Line series was the 760. It was a smaller version of the 900 and 910, and contained a 40 watt treble and 50 watt bass amplifier. A smaller, more portable version of the 760 is the 820. It is a solid-state cabinet like the 760, and it connects to the organ with a 9-pin <b>connector</b> <b>as</b> well. However, it is only [...] high and has only a single rotor with a full-range 12-inch speaker.|$|E

The route {{comes to a}} partial interchange with the Garden State Parkway, with access {{to and from the}} northbound direction of the parkway. Past this interchange, the road heads through commercial areas and continues into Absecon. In Absecon, the White Horse Pike widens to six lanes and crosses CR651 before intersecting US9. After passing near the Absecon Station, US30 crosses Shore Road, which heads north as Route157 and south as CR585. The road turns south, narrowing back to four lanes before entering marshland to the west of Absecon Bay. There is a northbound exit and southbound entrance to CR646 before US30 crosses the Jonathans Thorofare into Atlantic City, where the name becomes Absecon Boulevard as it turns to the east. Absecon Boulevard crosses Newfound Thorofare before heading south and passing over Duck Thorofare. The road passes by the Jersey-Atlantic Wind Farm and heads southeast across Beach Thorofare. At this point, US30 widens to six lanes and passes to the north of residential neighborhoods, with maintenance of the road switching from the New Jersey Department of Transportation to the South Jersey Transportation Authority. After crossing the Penrose Canal, the route passes over the tunnel carrying the Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector and intersects the southern terminus of Route87, where there is a ramp to the northbound Atlantic City– Brigantine Connector.

500|$|Planning for the Puncheon Run Connector {{dates back}} to the 1980s, when a [...] "Relief Route" [...] was {{proposed}} for US 13 between Dover and Wilmington. In 1987, plans called for the Puncheon Run Connector to be built along its current alignment between US 13 and DE 1, with an intermediate interchange at US 113 (Bay Road), in addition to US 13 being upgraded to a freeway south to Woodside, with interchanges at Webbs Lane in Dover and DE 10 in Camden. In 1992, DelDOT held a meeting to discuss proposals for the road, including a possible Far West By-Pass Connector through the western part of Dover. The city of Dover initially opposed the Puncheon Run Connector and favored the Far West By-Pass <b>Connector</b> <b>as</b> the latter would ease traffic congestion caused by development {{in the western part of}} the city. Plans for the connector were modified in 1992 to not include the upgrade of US 13 to a freeway between Woodside and Dover. Prior to the construction of the Puncheon Run Connector, a site along Puncheon Run had to be excavated by DelDOT and Louis Berger & Associates as it consisted of Native American artifacts from prehistoric times. The excavation of the site lasted from October 1997 to September 1998. Construction on the road began in October 1998. The Puncheon Run Connector was completed and opened to traffic in a ribbon cutting ceremony on December 19, 2000, with Governor Tom Carper and DelDOT secretary Anne Canby in attendance. The road was constructed by David A. Bramble, Inc. and G.A. & F.C. Wagman, Inc. at a cost of $25 million.|$|E
