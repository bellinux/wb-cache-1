MethodsThe authors randomized eligible patients to receive K 305 spray (n = 44), tetracaine hydrochloride spray (n = 44), or a placebo solution (n = 22). The authors compared the incidence of the primary efficacy end point—completion of the procedure without rescue local anesthetic—by means of a 1 -tailed Fisher exact test. ResultsThe end point incidence was 84. 1 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 69. 9 - 93. 4) with K 305, 27. 3 % (95 % CI,  15. 0 - 42. 8) with tetracaine only, and 27. 3 % (95 % CI, 10. 7 - 50. 2) with placebo (P <. 001 for K 305 versus tetracaine only and versus placebo). <b>Combination</b> <b>spray</b> was associated with statistically significant but transient increases in blood pressure. The most frequent adverse events were rhinorrhea and nasal congestion, which resolved within 2 hours after treatment and occurred more often in the K 305 group and tetracaine-only group. ConclusionsIn this study population, the K 305 combination nasal spray was safe and more effective in attaining pulpal anesthesia of maxillary teeth from premolar to premolar compared with tetracaine-only and placebo sprays.

Fruit thinning {{has been used}} for hundreds of years to manipulate blooming and crop load to improve the alternate bearing process. Frequently, <b>combination</b> <b>sprays</b> of two or more chemical thinners are used in various fruit trees and the thinning responses were additive and more effective than individual compounds. In this study, we investigated the effects of Naphthalene acetic acid and carbaryl alone and in combination in thinning of ‘Kinnow’ mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco) trees. Some characteristics such as fruit weight, diameter and volume, total soluble solid (TSS), titrable acidity (TA), TSS/TA, vitamin C and peel thickness were measured prior to harvest for 2010 and 2011 as a complete randomized block design with 13 treatments and four replications. Results showed that the application of NAA and carbaryl alone in June drop stage of fruit growth increased fruit thinning percentage, TSS of fruit juice, fruit weight, volume, diameter and length. These chemical thinners improved fruit size significantly by increasing the leaf/fruit ratio. <b>Combination</b> <b>sprays</b> could not effectively thin fruits than individual chemicals and thus had no effect on fruit size.

The unique structure of 3 -D SU-CNTs prepared by this approach using a <b>combination</b> of <b>spray</b> pyrolysis and thermal CVD processes accounted for the enhancement of the mechanical properties of the polymer composites. The strong interaction of multiple CNTs with the large surface of the MNP core in the 3 -D SU-CNT nanofillers facilitated strong coupling forces between the CNTs and polymer molecules.

Methods: A randomized, prospective, comparative study design was conducted in sixty patients divided into two groups: Group (L) (n = 30) patients received low dose of dexmedetomidine (0. 5 μg/kg) along with airway blocks and Group (H) (n = 30) patients received standard dose of dexmedetomidine (1 μg/kg) along with airway blocks. Both the groups received dexmedetomidine infusion over 10 min followed by airway block. Quantitative data were analysed by applying Student's t-test whereas qualitative data were analysed with Chi-square test. The objectives were to compare patients' Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale (OAA/S) as primary outcome and other variables such as endoscopy, intubation condition, tolerance and haemodynamic stability among low and standard doses of dexmedetomidine.

Red Delicious was studied in the Division of Fruit Science, SKUAST-Kashmir, Shalimar, Srinagar during the year 2013 and 2014. Twenty five year old apple trees of cv. Red Delicious were selected at the Sher-e-Kashmir university of Agricultural Sciences and Technology, Shalimar, Kashmir. The soluble boron of solubor (0. 1 %) and bio-stimulants of Biozyme (1. 5 ml/lt) and triacontanol (10 ppm) and their <b>combinations</b> were <b>sprayed</b> at three timings: (i) At pink bud stage (ii) three weeks after fruit set of apple (iii) two months after second spray. Two months after second spray, solubor was replaced with 0. 5 % CaCl 2. The results revealed that combination of solubor + biozyme + triacontanol and solubor + biozyme was more effective to improve floral and yield characteristics with fruit set (74. 71 and 69. 50 %) and yield (97. 75 and 92. 70 kg/trees) Fruits were harvested and analysed for their physico-chemical characteristics. Foliar application of solubor + biozyme + triaconatanol and biozyme + triacontanol improved fruit color, size, weight, volume, firmness and TSS, sugars while acidity declined in all treatments at various stages...|$|R
