40|$|AbstractA gap in {{manpower}} and expertise exists in cybersecurity network defense teams. Little {{is known about}} how to compose these defense teams with maximum capability to address {{a wide variety of}} hard problems. Team selection can involve a wide array of human factors. We targeted a subset of interpersonal personality traits that in other disciplines, were related to short- and long-term team performance in dyad work teams as well as therapeutic group success. Eight novice cybersecurity teams completed the Interpersonal Adjective Scale-Revised (IAS-R) inventory [31] prior to participating in a 2 -day <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>exercise</b> on a simulated network. Teams were rank ordered from 1 to 8 based on their overall team score tracked in a jeopardy-style score board embedded in the exercise. We explored the relationship between team performance and interpersonal style complementarity as well as the degree of interpersonal maladjustment (vector length). First, we tallied the number of complementary interpersonal styles for the top-four and bottom-four performing teams using four theories of complementarity ([7] [9] [26] [27]). No trends emerged to support a possible relationship between the number of complementary interpersonal styles on a given team and respective team performance. Second, we evaluated the mean interpersonal style vector lengths and found that our top performing teams had the highest mean style vector lengths; long style vector lengths is an indicator of potential interpersonal maladjustment. Third, we explored which octant-level traits were predominant in the top- and bottom-performing teams. The top- performing teams tended to have higher counts of extreme expressions of hostile traits and bottom-performing teams tended to have higher counts of moderate expressions of friendly traits. Thus, maladjustment in the hostile quadrants of traits was trending in our top performing teams comparatively. However, small sample sizes and uncontrolled research settings make it difficult to interpret these findings with any certainty. We aimed to provide results using well-established social science theory of interpersonal styles and respective psychometrics for future cybersecurity researchers to build from...|$|E

40|$|Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) have a {{significant}} educational impact on student's learning. However, researchers report time intensive interaction is needed between ITS developers and domain-experts to gather and represent domain knowledge. The challenge is augmented when the target domain is ill-defined. The primary problem resides in often using traditional approaches for gathering domain and tutoring experts' knowledge at design time and conventional methods for knowledge representation built for well-defined domains. Similar to evolving knowledge acquisition approaches used in other fields, we replace this restricted view of ITS knowledge learning merely at design time with an incremental approach that continues training the ITS during run time. We investigate a gradual knowledge learning approach through continuous instructor-student demonstrations. We present a Mixed-response Intelligent Tutoring System based on Learning from Demonstration that gathers and represents knowledge at run time. Furthermore, we implement two knowledge representation methods (Weighted Markov Models and Weighted Context Free Grammars) and corresponding algorithms for building domain and tutoring knowledge-bases at run time. We use students' solutions to <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>exercises</b> as the primary data source for our initial framework testing. Five experiments were conducted using various granularity levels for data representation, multiple datasets differing in content and size, and multiple experts to evaluate framework performance. Using our WCFG-based knowledge representation method {{in conjunction with a}} finer data representation granularity level, the implemented framework reached 97 % effectiveness in providing correct feedback. The ITS demonstrated consistency when applied to multiple datasets and experts. Furthermore, on average, only 1. 4 hours were needed by instructors to build the knowledge-base and required tutorial actions per exercise. Finally, the ITS framework showed suitable and consistent performance when applied to a second domain. These results imply that ITS domain models for ill-defined domains can be gradually constructed, yet generate successful results with minimal effort from instructors and framework developers. We demonstrate that, in addition to providing an effective tutoring performance, an ITS framework can offer: scalability in data magnitude, efficiency in reducing human effort required for building a confident knowledge-base, metacognition in inferring its current knowledge, robustness in handling different pedagogical and tutoring criteria, and portability for multiple domain use...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedComputer Science courses often include laboratory exercises {{to make sure}} certain concepts are experienced hands-on by the students. These courses sometimes are taken by {{a large number of}} students and each assignment needs to be graded. Instructors or teaching assistants responsible for grading assignments are presented with the tedious task of verifying students' work. Besides making sure that each student performs the assignment correctly, the assignment grader may also be concerned that students do not cheat on the assignment by copying and submitting work from other students. The objective of this thesis is to investigate and develop a framework for Linux-based <b>cybersecurity</b> laboratory <b>exercises</b> performed on individual student computers. The purpose of the framework is to provide the designer of laboratory exercises with tools to parameterize labs for each student, and automate some aspects of the grading of laboratory exercises. A prototype of this framework was implemented by making use of the Linux Containers, which provide an additional benefit of standardizing execution environments utilized by students and instructors.
