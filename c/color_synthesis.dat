40|$|This paper proposes an {{image-based}} painterly rendering algorithm for automatically synthesizing {{an image}} with color ink diffusion. We suggest {{a mathematical model}} with a physical base to simulate the phenomenon of color colloidal ink diffusing into absorbent paper. Our algorithm contains three main parts: a feature extraction phase, a Kubelka-Munk (KM) color mixing phase, and a <b>color</b> ink diffusion <b>synthesis</b> phase. In the feature extraction phase, the information of the reference image is simplified by luminance division and color segmentation. In the color mixing phase, the KM theory is employed to approximate the result when one pigment is painted upon another pigment layer. Then, in the <b>color</b> ink diffusion <b>synthesis</b> phase, the physically-based model that we propose is employed to simulate the result of color ink diffusion in absorbent paper using a texture synthesis technique. Our image-based ink diffusing rendering (IBCIDR) algorithm eliminates the drawback of conventional Chinese ink simulations, which are limited to the black ink domain, and our approach demonstrates that, without using any strokes, a color image can be automatically converted to the diffused ink style with a visually pleasing appearance...|$|R
50|$|The first {{widely used}} method of color {{photography}} was the Autochrome plate, a process inventors and brothers Auguste and Louis Lumière {{began working on}} in the 1890s and commercially introduced in 1907. It was based on one of Louis Ducos du Hauron's ideas: instead of taking three separate photographs through color filters, take one through a mosaic of tiny color filters overlaid on the emulsion and view the results through an identical mosaic. If the individual filter elements were small enough, the three primary colors of red, blue, and green would blend together {{in the eye and}} produce the same additive <b>color</b> <b>synthesis</b> as the filtered projection of three separate photographs. Autochrome plates had an integral mosaic filter layer with roughly five million previously dyed potato grains per square inch added to the surface. Then {{through the use of a}} rolling press, five tons of pressure were used to flatten the grains, enabling every one of them to capture and absorb color and their microscopic size allowing the illusion that the colors are merged together. The final step was adding a coat of the light capturing substance silver bromide after which a color image could be imprinted and developed. In order to see it, reversal processing was used to develop each plate into a transparent positive that could be viewed directly or projected with an ordinary projector. One of the drawbacks of the technology is an exposure time of at least a second was required during the day in bright light and the worse the light is, the time required quickly goes up. An indoor portrait required a few minutes with the subject not being able to move or else the picture would come out blurry. This was because the grains absorbed the color fairly slowly and that a filter of a yellowish-orange color was added to the plate to keep the photograph from coming out excessively blue. Although necessary, the filter had the effect of reducing the amount of light that was absorbed. Another drawback was that the film could only be enlarged so much until the many dots that make up the image become apparent.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{hierarchical}} color correction algorithm for enhancing {{the color of}} digital images obtained from low-quality digital image capture devices such as cell phone cameras. The proposed method {{is based on a}} multilayer hierarchical stochastic framework whose parameters are learned in an offline training procedure using the well-known expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. This hierarchical framework functions by first making soft assignments of images into defect classes and then processing the images in each defect class with an optimized algorithm. The hierarchical color correction is performed in three stages. In the first stage, global color attributes of the low-quality input image are used in a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) framework to perform a soft classification of the image into predefined global image classes. In the second stage, the input image is processed with a nonlinear color correction algorithm that is designed for each of the global classes. This color correction algorithm, which we refer to as resolution <b>synthesis</b> <b>color</b> correction (RSCC), applies a spatially varying color correction determined by the local color attributes of the input image. In the third stage, the outputs of the RSCC predictors are combined using the global classification weights to yield the color corrected output image. We compare the performance of the proposed method to other commercial color correction algorithms on cell phone camera images obtained from different sources. Both subjective and objective measures of quality indicate that the new color correction algorithm improves quality over the existing methods.

40|$|Conventional four-color {{printing}} systems {{are limited by}} an insufficient number of degrees of freedom for tuning the visible region of the spectrum; as a consequence, they are often limited to metameric color reproductions. That is, color matches defined for a single observer and illuminant (usually CIE illuminant D 50 and the 1931 standard observer) are often unstable when viewed under other illuminants or by other observers. For critical color-matching applications, such as catalog sales and artwork reproductions, the results are usually disappointing due to typical uncontrolled lighting and viewing. Furthermore, the existing multiple-ink printing systems, which all focus on expanding color gamut, do not alleviate metamerism since their separation algorithms are trichromatic in nature. The advantage of an increased number of degrees of freedom is not exploited. A research and development program has been initiated at the Rochester Institute of Technology 2 ̆ 7 s Munsell Color Science Laboratory to develop a spectral-based color reproduction system Research has included multi-spectral acquisition systems and spectral-based printing. The current research is concerned with bridging these analysis and synthesis stages of color reproduction. The goal of the doctoral research was to minimize IV metamerism between originals and their corresponding reproductions, thus best approaching spectral matches. Accomplishing this goal required first estimating the spectral properties of the colorants used to create the original object or set of objects. After the possible colorants were statistically uncovered, they were correlated to an existing ink database for determining an optimal ink set. An algorithm was developed for predicting ink overprints, known as the Neugebauer secondary, tertiary, quaternary primaries, etc., which is the required information for <b>color</b> <b>synthesis</b> using a halftone printing process. Once all the required Neugebauer primaries were determined, a spectralbased printing model minimizing metamerism was derived to calculate the corresponding color separations for each selected ink. The various research components were tested computationally and experimentally. Finally, a DuPont Waterproof system {{was used as a}} representation of halftone printing process to output each color separation in order to test several computational subsystems. This completes the chain of a spectral-based output system. Five modules of this chain were developed and discussed in this dissertation...|$|E

In this study, tocotrienol rich fraction (TRF) was used to inhibit melanin synthesis. TRF contains 75 % α-tocotrienol and 25 % tocopherol. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of tocotrienol rich fraction (TRF) on melanin synthesis by determining melanin content and expression of genes involved in the regulation of melanin synthesis in skin melanocytes. Melanin synthesis was studied by determining melanin level and tyrosinase enzyme activity, while expression of TYR, TYRP 1 and TYRP 2 genes was determined by quantitative real time reverse transcriptase poly-merase chain reaction (real time RT-PCR). Primary culture of skin melanocytes were divided into two groups; control and cells that were treated with 500 μg/ml tocotrienol rich fraction for 24 hours. Our results showed that there was a reduction in melanin content and tyrosinase activity in skin melanocytes treated with tocotrienol rich fraction compared to the control (p< 0. 05). Expression of TYRP 2 gene in melanocytes treated with tocotrienol rich fraction was also decreased (p< 0. 05) compared to the control. In conclusion, palm tocotrienol rich fraction has anti pigmentation property that inhibits melanin synthesis in cellular aging by inhibiting tyrosinase activity and down regulating TYRP 2 gene expression...|$|R

The behaviors that determine weight status are embedded in the core social and cultural processes and environments of day-to-day life in these populations. Therefore, identifying effective, sustainable solutions to obesity requires an ecological model that is inclusive of relevant contextual variables. Race and ethnicity are potent stratification variables in U. S. society and strongly influence life contexts, including many aspects that relate to eating and physical activity behaviors.

In our data, one actor produces a total of 967 listener vocalizations, in his natural speaking style and three acted emotion-specific personalities. In an open categorization scheme, we find that eleven categories occur on at least 5 % of the vocalizations, and that most vocalizations are better described by two or three categories rather than a single one.

There is a strong, approximately linear correlation between the M/L for different wavebands and rest-frame color. The root-mean-scatter scatter in M_dyn/L residuals implies {{that it is possible to}} estimate the M/L with an accuracy of 0. 25 dex from a single rest-frame optical <b>color.</b> Stellar population <b>synthesis</b> (SPS) models with a Salpeter stellar initial mass function (IMF) can not simultaneously match M_dyn/L_g vs. (g-z) _rest-frame and M_dyn/L_K vs. (g-K) _rest-frame. By changing the slope of the IMF we are still unable to explain the M/L of the bluest and reddest galaxies. We find that an IMF with a slope between α= 2. 35 and α= 1. 35 provides the best match. We also explore a broken IMF with a Salpeter slope at M 4 M_ and a slope α in the intermediate region. The data favor a slope of α= 1. 35 over α= 2. 35. Nonetheless, our results show that variations between different SPS models are comparable to the IMF variations. In our analysis we assume that the variation in M/L and color is driven by differences in age, and that other contributions (e. g., metallicity evolution, dark matter) are small. These assumptions may be an important source of uncertainty as galaxies evolve in more complex ways. Comment: 16 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journa...|$|R
40|$|We compare three recent {{models of}} the {{spectral}} evolution of stellar populations to assess the origin of serious discrepancies in the colors predicted for greater than or similar to 1 Gyr old populations of the same input age and metallicity. To isolate the source of these discrepancies, we investigate separately the two main characteristics of each model: the underlying stellar evolution prescription and the spectral calibrations used to transform the theoretical Hertzsprung-Russell diagram into observables. A 0. 05 mag discrepancy in B - V color is caused almost entirely by a known limitation of theoretical spectra. Differences in spectral calibrations are found to account for {{only a small fraction}} of the 0. 25 mag discrepancies in V - K color and of the 25 % dispersion in mass-to-visual light ratio among the models considered here. The main source of disagreement for these quantities in the underlying stellar evolution prescription. For idealized galaxies containing a single generation of stars and no dust, properties derived from broadband <b>colors</b> using population <b>synthesis</b> models are found to be accurate by roughly +/- 35 % in age at fixed metallicity, 25 % in metallicity at fixed age if the heavy-element mixture is assumed to be scaled-solar, and 35 % in mass at fixed metallicity and fixed initial mass function. These indicative uncertainties are based on the dispersion in the predictions of the models investigated here. There appear to be persistent problems in virtually every ingredient of population synthesis models. The most serious are the lifetimes and luminosities of stars in post-main-sequence evolutionary stages; the temperature of the red giant branch and color-temperature relation for cool stars; and the lack of accurate libraries of stellar spectra, especially for cool stars and for nonsolar metallicities. These problems have profound causes. The main one is the high sensitivity of stellar evolution models on the efficiency of several critical factors which are either not sufficiently understood or cannot yet be determined uniquely from comparisons with observations (opacities, heavy-element mixture, helium content, convection, diffusion, mass loss, rotational mixing). Other major limitations are the difficult spectral modeling of cool stars and the unavailability of calibration stars for metal-rich populations and populations with altered chemical mixes...|$|R

40|$|Organic light {{emitting}} diodes (OLEDs) prepared from electroactive materials show great potential for multicolor display and white light source applications. Unfortunately, the commercialization of multilayer OLEDs has been slow. This can be attributed {{in part to the}} vapor deposition technique used to assemble small molecule thin films. The process is not amenable to large area displays and is relatively costly. An attractive alternative solution to this problem is to replace small molecules with organic polymers, which could be solution processed in an efficient and economical manner. Polymeric materials also offer the unique potential to achieve nanoscale self-assembled structures through their functional architecture. These materials can be solution processed and mimic multilayered small molecule devices to achieve improved performance and/or balanced <b>color.</b> Design and <b>synthesis</b> and OLED testing of functional polymers which can achieve defined multilayer or nanostructured film characteristics through simple solution processing is the focus of this thesis. 	In Chapter 1, the history of OLED materials as well as the device mechanism and key organic electronic characteristics necessary for high performance devices is introduced. There is also a discussion on the methods for device testing and characterization. 	The design and synthesis of novel dendronized linear polymer host materials is presented in Chapter 2. These polymers should possess a rigid linear rod like architecture which had not been investigated for its potential to order a thin film in an assembly of cylindrical structures. This host material was desired in order to optimize the interface of hole and electron transporting material to achieve improved recombination in the thin film. 	Similarly, in Chapter 3 a diblock copolymer architecture is studied as host material in OLED devices. In this work the differences between nanoscale self assembled diblock copolymers of hole and electron transporting units and random copolymers of the same composition are studied. These materials show a high external quantum efficiency of 5. 6 % for a simply prepared single layer device which is enabled by the self-assembly of the functional diblock copolymer architecture. 	In Chapter 4, these diblock copolymers are exploited not only to create nanoscale domains of hole and electron transporting domains but also to organize the site isolation of two different colored phosphorescent emitters. Polymerizable heteroleptic iridium complexes of different color were developed and covalently incorporated into separate blocks of the diblock copolymer. Following the self assembly of thin film morphology through simple spin coating, the energy transfer from blue to red emitters was greatly reduced enabling synergistic dual emission for white electroluminescence. 	Chapter 5 discusses the design and synthesis of electroactive crosslinked polymer nanoparticles with nanoscale size that can achieve the site isolation of emitters. Using different polymerizable iridium complexes, batches of different colored polymer nanoparticles can be simply prepared and mixed at the device preparation stage in any ratio to yield tunable colored devices. These nanoparticles dispersions behave as {{light emitting}} inks which can be simply solution processed with predictable and stable electroluminescent color. 	In Chapter 6, difunctional polymerizable iridium complexes are used to achieve multilayer structures of electron blocking layers and phosphorescent emissive layers. These small molecules can be solution processed to yield thin films which can be crosslinked through simple heating step. A subsequent layer can then be deposited on top to build up all solution processed multilayered devices. A select high triplet energy crosslinkable iridium complex was shown to perform well as an electron blocker and hole transporting layer in OLEDs with improved performance over the standard water soluble hole transporting layer poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) ...|$|R

Applicability of laccases has been highlighted due to green nature and versatile biochemical {{features of the}} enzymes. In particular, use of fungal laccases that are commercially available {{has proven to be}} effective for several biotechnological areas including pulp or textile bleaching, bioremediation, organic synthesis, and polymer surface modification. The green nature of the laccase applications can be markedly enhanced by the use of low-molecular-weight naturally occurring phenols, whose involvements in laccase-catalyzed in vivo metabolisms contributing carbon recycling in land ecosystem and morphogenesis of bio-matrices are also evident. Although several review papers focusing on laccase biotechnological applicability have been reported, connection between the in vivo metabolisms and the application concepts has not been attracted. Thus, we here reviewed current advances in laccase-catalyzed oxidations of naturally occurring phenols particularly focusing on laccase-mediator system (LMS) and organic synthesis, and discussed how both the application strategies can mimic in vivo biometabolism to make the application processes much greener and to extend applicability of the green reactions. 	Laccases have low redox potentials limiting their environmental and industrial applications. The use of laccase mediators has proven to be an effective approach for overcoming the low redox potentials. However, knowledge about the role played by the mediator cocktails in such a laccase-mediator system (LMS) is scarce. Here we assembled different dual-agent mediator cocktails containing 2, 2 ′-azino-bis-(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonate (ABTS), vanillin, and/or acetovanillone, and compared their mediating capabilities with those of each individual mediator alone in oxidation of pentachlorophenol (PCP) by Ganoderma lucidum laccase. Cocktails containing ABTS and either vanillin or acetovanillone strongly promoted PCP removal compared to the use of each mediator alone. The removal enhancement was correlated with mediator molar ratios of the cocktails and incubation times. Analysis of the kinetic constants for each mediator compound showed that G. lucidum laccase was very prone to react with ABTS rather than vanillin and acetovanillone in the cocktails. Moreover, the presence of the ABTS radical (ABTS+&# 8226) and vanillin or acetovanillone significantly enhanced PCP removal concomitant with electron transfer from vanillin or acetovanillone to ABTS+&# 8226. These results strongly suggest that vanillin and acetovanillone mediate the reaction between ABTS and PCP via multiple sequential electron transfers among laccase and its mediators. Laccase efficiently catalyzes polymerization of phenolic compounds. However, knowledge on applications of polymers synthesized in this manner remains scarce. Here, the potential of laccase-catalyzed polymerization of natural phenols to form products useful in hair dyeing was investigated. All 15 tested phenols yielded colored products after laccase treatment and color diversity was attained by using mixtures of two phenolic monomers. After exploring color differentiation pattern of 120 different reactions with statistical regression analysis, three monomer combinations, namely gallic acid and syringic acid, catechin and catechol, and ferulic acid and syringic acid, giving rise to brown, black, and red materials, respectively, were further characterized because such colors are commercially important for gray hair dyeing. Selected polymers could strongly absorb visible light and their hydrodynamic sizes ranged from 100 to 400 nm. Analyses of enzyme kinetic constants, liquid chromatography, and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) coupled with collision-induced dissociation MS/MS indicate that both monomers in reactions involving catechin and catechol, and ferulic acid and syringic acid, are <b>colored</b> by heteropolymer <b>synthesis,</b> but the gallic acid/syringic acid combination is based on homopolymer mixture formation. Comparison of color parameters from these three reactions with those of corresponding artificial homopolymer mixtures also supported the idea that laccase may catalyze either hetero- or homo-polymer synthesis. We finally used selected materials to dye gray hair. Each material colored hair appropriately and the dyeing showed excellent resistance to conventional shampooing. Our study indicates that laccase-catalyzed polymerization of natural phenols is applicable to the development of new cosmetic pigments. Fungal laccase-based eco-coloration with plant-derived phenols is highly applicable to cosmetic or food processing industries due to eco-friendly features of the dye synthesis process. However, the synthesis procedure is not based on any theoretical rationale so that considerable experimental work is required for finding desirable colors. Here, the coloration reaction using natural phenol blends was numerically predicted using a well-defined learning algorithm, the support vector machine. Both forward and backward predictions were successfully developed using 1, 439 different colorations for training and testing. The forward calculations commenced with known monomer compositions and yielded color parametersthe mean absolute errors for each parameter were 1. 4222 for L*, 0. 7583 for a*, and 2. 1442 for b*. Reversely, the backward calculations with known color parameters yielded monomer compositionsaverage accuracy was 71. 9 %. Two variables regarding color differentiation of each natural phenol were identified to critically affect the backward prediction accuracy, suggesting dependence of the accuracy on monomer compositions and color differentiation capacity of each monomer. Based on true or false (either -positive or -negative) ratio analysis, relation between the accuracy and the monomer composition was further discussed. Our coloration data pool and predictive models will aid to develop synthetic routes to give rise to desirable colors via fungal laccase-catalyzed polymerization of plant-derived phenols. The color SVM software is available at [URL] Natural organic coagulants (NOCs) such as chitosan and Moringa oleifera seeds have been extensively characterized for potential application in water treatment as an alternative to metal-based coagulants. However, the action of both chitosan and Moringa oleifera seeds is mainly restricted to anionic organic pollutants because of their cationic functional groups affording poor cationic pollutant coagulation by electrostatic repulsion. In this study, we employed ethanolic grape seed extract (GSE) and grape seed-derived polyphenols such as tannic acid and catechin in an effort to find novel NOCs showing stable anionic forms for removal of cationic organic pollutants. The target substances tested were malachite green (MG) and crystal violet (CV), both mutagenic cationic dyes. Polyphenol treatment induced fast decolorization followed by gradual floc formation concomitant with red or blue shifts in maximum absorbance wavelengths of the cationic dyes. Liquid chromatography analysis of flocs formed by polyphenols directly showed that initial supramolecular complexes attributed mainly to electrostatic attraction between polyphenol hydroxyphenyl groups and cationic dyes further progressed into stronger aggregates, leading to precipitation of dye-polyphenol complexes. Consistent with the results obtained using catechin and tannic acid, use of GSE also resulted in effective decolorization and coagulation of soluble MG and CV in aqueous solutions. Screening of several organic GSE components for NOC activity strongly suggested that natural polyphenols are the main organic ingredients causing MG and CV removal via gradual floc formation. The treatment by natural polyphenols and GSE decreased toxicity of MG- or CV-contaminated water...|$|R
