50|$|A Scout Group {{is led by}} a Group Scout Leader (GSL) whose {{responsibility}} {{is to ensure that}} the leaders of the different sections work together facilitating progress from one section to another by the young people in the Group. The GSL is also responsible for ensuring that the other leaders in the Group take part in leader training. Scout Groups are managed by an Executive Committee, with a Chairman, Secretary and Treasurer. They support a uniformed Group Scout Leader, and support the activities and events organised by the Section Leaders within the group. The Executive Committee is elected annually by the The Group Scout Council, a gathering of the parents, adult leaders and representatives of the young people of the Group.Scout Groups can form relationships with local organisations, such as local churches, temples, schools or the YMCA. Typically, this involves agreements to support certain events in exchange for the use of a building or some financial payment. These Groups are described as Sponsored Scout Groups and must arrange a Sponsorship Agreement with the organisation that sponsors them and with the District <b>Commissioner.</b> <b>Groups</b> without this type of affiliation are described as Open Scout Groups. Joint Scout and Guide Groups are supported by The Scout Association and Girlguiding; in these Groups, typically Scout and Guide sections share the same meeting place, equipment, funding and Executive Committee. A Scout Group meet in a school or church hall, or may be the owners of a Scout headquarters building.|$|R

5000|$|In February 2017, an FE Commissioner {{intervention}} report exposed grave financial problems facing Hull College <b>Group.</b> <b>Commissioner</b> Richard Atkins’ team was sent in {{to carry out}} their assessment, after the Skills Funding Agency issued it with a notice of concern in November 2016. The report on Hull explained that the notice was issued because the college had been rated inadequate by the SFA for financial health (based on its 2016 to 2018 financial plan) {{and as a result of}} the college’s request for exceptional financial support. It warned that the senior leadership team had not succeeded in addressing key issues facing the college, including steady decline in financial performance and loss of market share. There was said to be concern at all levels of the organisation that it “lacks strategic vision and strong, resolute leadership and that this is frustrating and demotivating for staff”.|$|R
50|$|On March 22, 1989, Pete Rozelle {{announced}} that he would retire as commissioner as soon as a successor was elected. Many owners wanted Rozelle to be succeeded by two equally responsible chiefs; a president that would oversee the business aspects of the game, and a commissioner responsible for maintaining the game's integrity. A six-owner search committee consisting of Wellington Mara, Lamar Hunt, Art Modell, Robert Parins, Dan Rooney, and Ralph Wilson was formed to find candidates for the job and the firm of Heidrick & Struggles was hired to assist in the search. The committee narrowed the candidates to five finalists; New Orleans Saints general manager and minority owner Jim Finks, New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority President and CEO Robert E. Mulcahy III, former Green Bay Packers defensive end and businessman Willie Davis, former Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul G. Kirk, and league attorney Paul Tagliabue. Housing and Urban Development Secretary and former Buffalo Bills quarterback Jack Kemp was considered for the job, but chose to remain in his cabinet post. Although committee chairman Mara had said they would present the owners with three or four candidates, the committee unanimously endorsed Finks and reached an agreement with him on a five-year contract. Although Finks ran unopposed for the job at the July 7 owners meeting, a group of eleven newer owners abstained from voting, which prevented Finks from receiving the nineteen votes necessary to become <b>Commissioner.</b> This <b>group</b> did not object to Finks' candidacy, but abstained on principal because they wanted more of a voice in the selection process, felt that they had not given enough information on the search process from the committee, were upset that the committee only recommended Finks despite promising several candidates, and were upset {{by the fact that the}} committee had begun contract negotiations with Finks before he was even elected to the post.|$|R

This project is supplementary to the long-standing project of the Scottish committee on the History of Parliament to provide concise biographies of all commissioners from burghs and shires who attended Scottish parliaments and associated conventions of estates from 1357 to 1707. Main Topics : In addition to the individual commissioner's election to and attendance at parliaments and conventions of estates, each biography records genealogical information and family connections, education, profession, property and business interests, public work and offices and voting records where known. Comprehensive datasets have been compiled on every burgh and shire commissioner from the reign of David II to the Treaty of Union. The tabled textual and alphanumeric information facilitates analysis of continuity and change {{in the composition of}} the Scottish parliament and representation of constituencies from the fourteenth to the early eighteenth centuries. At the same time, parlimentary <b>commissioners</b> can be <b>grouped</b> by occupations, by regions and by economic interests as well as by political persuasions, by office holding and by social affiliations.

40|$|The EU Electronic Privacy Directive 20021 {{requires}} Member States {{to ensure}} the confidentiality of communications. It prohibits. listening, tapping, storage or other kinds of interception or surveillance of communications.

40|$|Purpose - To {{explore the}} {{perceived}} and potential roles of pharmacists {{in the care}} of young people aged 10 - 24 years with chronic illness, through the exemplar of juvenile arthritis, from the perspectives of UK community and hospital pharmacists, health service commissioners, rheumatology health professionals and lay advocates. Methods - A sequential mixed methods study design comprising: focus groups with community and hospital pharmacists; telephone interviews with pharmacy and rheumatology stakeholders and <b>commissioners,</b> and multidisciplinary <b>group</b> discussions to prioritize roles generated by the first two qualitative phases. Results - The high priority roles for pharmacists, identified by pharmacists and rheumatology staff, were: developing generic healthcare skills among young people; transferring information effectively across care interfaces; building trusting relationships with young people; helping young people to find credible online health information, and the need to develop specialist expertise. Participants identified associated challenges for pharmacists in supporting young people with chronic illness. These challenges included parents collecting prescription refills alone, thus reducing opportunities to engage, and pharmacist isolation from the wider healthcare team. Conclusions - This study has led to the identification of specific enhancements to pharmacy services for young people which have received the endorsement {{of a wide range of}} stakeholders. These suggestions could inform the next steps in developing the contribution of community and hospital pharmacy to support young people with chronic illness in the optimal use of their medication...|$|R
5000|$|Bethuel Kiplagat was the {{chairman}} of the commission. Originally, President Mwai Kibaki picked him to head the commission. However, Kiplagat later stepped down in November 2010 after being pressured to resign by fellow <b>commissioners,</b> civil society <b>groups,</b> human rights activists and the general public since he was part of a meeting of the Kenyan Intelligence Committee held less than forty eight hours prior to the security operation that resulted in the Wagalla massacre, which according to the UN was the worst massacre in Kenya's history. The TJRC investigated the massacre and made a finding that Kiplagat should be barred from further public offices and investigated for possible complicity in the massacre. It is the first time a truth commission has made a negative finding concerning its own Chairman. In addition to the Wagalla Massacre, the Commission investigated two additional violations to which Kiplagat was linked: the murder of Kenya's Foreign Minister, Robert Ouko (politician); Kiplagat was also accused of land grabbing while he acted as Permanent Secretary during former President Moi's regime. In April 2012, Kiplagat was reinstated as TJRC chairman after the Justice Minister Eugene Wamalwa brokered a truce between him and the other commissioners. Previously, Kiplagat worked with the National Christian Council of Kenya, served as an Ambassador to France, the High Commissioner to UK, and the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Kiplagat was also the chair {{of the board of the}} African Medical and Research Foundation and worked with Kenya's Special Envoy to the Somalia peace process.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a structured overview of different self-governance mechanisms for privacy and data {{protection in the}} corporate world, with a special focus on Internet privacy. It also looks at {{the role of the}} state, and how it has related to privacy selfgovernance over time. While early data protection started out as law-based regulation by nation-states, transnational self-governance mechanisms have become more important due to the rise of global telecommunications and the Internet. Reach, scope, precision and enforcement of these industry codes of conduct vary a lot. The more binding they are, the more limited is their reach, though they – like the state-based instruments for privacy protection – are becoming more harmonised and global in reach nowadays. These “social codes” of conduct are developed by the private sector with limited participation of official data protection <b>commissioners,</b> public interest <b>groups,</b> or international organisations. Software tools - “technical codes” - for online privacy protection can give back some control over their data to individual users and customers, but only have limited reach and applications. The privacy-enhancing design of network infrastructures and database architectures is still mainly developed autonomously by the computer and software industry. Here, we can recently find a stronger, but new role of the state. Instead of regulating data processors directly, governments and oversight agencies now focus more on the intermediaries – standards developers, large software companies, or industry associations. And instead of prescribing and penalising, they now rely more on incentive-structures like certifications or public funding for social and technical self-governance instruments of privacy protection. The use of technology as an instrument and object of regulation is thereby becoming more popular, but the success of this approach still depends on the social codes and the underlying norms which technology is supposed to embed...|$|R
5000|$|In the Nebraska Supreme Court’s {{early years}} {{there were no}} {{regulations}} as to what cases could be appealed and heard by the court. Due {{to the lack of}} regulations the Supreme Court’s docket became overloaded. As a solution the Nebraska Supreme Court was allowed to elect commissioners to assist with the workload. Originally three commissioners were elected, one from the Democratic Party, one from the Republican Party, and the last a member of the Populist Party. The three commissioners would serve a term of three years. In 1901 the commissioners numbers increased from three to a total of nine. Six of the nine commissioners would serve a one-year term and three would serve a two-year term. The <b>commissioners</b> sat in <b>groups</b> of three. This resulted in the creation of four appellate courts, the fourth being the Supreme Court. Select District Court justices were allowed to sit on cases heard by the Supreme Court under four stipulations found in Article V, Section 2 of the state’s constitution. If the court was sitting in two separate five judge divisions, if the constitutionality of a statute was in question, an appeal case of a convicted homicide, and lastly when a decision by a division of the Nebraska Supreme Court was under review. [...] ) In 1977 a general guideline pertaining to the format of a court report was drafted and released to the court’s reporters. This guideline would assure that all reports were structured in the same manner. Even with the efforts to increase the time efficiency of the Supreme Court the docket remained over filled. It was proposed to increase the existing bench of seven judges to a bench of nine. The amendment was opposed but revisited later in 1977. It was in this year that the Supreme Court Judges received a salary of 39,750 dollars, an increase from previous years.|$|R
