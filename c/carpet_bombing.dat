5|$|Nixon {{approved}} a secret B-52 <b>carpet</b> <b>bombing</b> campaign of North Vietnamese (and, later, allied Khmer Rouge) positions in Cambodia in March 1969 (code-named Operation Menu), {{without the consent}} of Cambodian leader Norodom Sihanouk. In mid-1969, Nixon began efforts to negotiate peace with the North Vietnamese, sending a personal letter to North Vietnamese leaders, and peace talks began in Paris. Initial talks, however, did not result in an agreement. In May 1969 he publicly proposed to withdraw all American troops from South Vietnam provided North Vietnam also did so and for South Vietnam to hold internationally supervised elections with Viet Cong participation.|$|E
5|$|The B-52D was a {{dedicated}} long-range bomber without a reconnaissance option. The Big Belly modifications allowed the B-52D to carry heavy loads of conventional bombs for <b>carpet</b> <b>bombing</b> over Vietnam, while the Rivet Rambler modification added the Phase V ECM systems, which {{was better than}} the systems used on most later B-52s. Because of these upgrades and its long range capabilities, the D model was used more extensively in Vietnam than any other model. Aircraft assigned to Vietnam were painted in a camouflage colour scheme with black bellies to defeat searchlights.|$|E
5|$|Information {{obtained}} {{later from}} North Korean prisoners revealed the divisions the Far East Command {{thought to be}} still west of the Naktong had already crossed to the east side and {{were not in the}} bombed area. No evidence was found that the bombing killed a single North Korean soldier. However, the bombing appeared to have destroyed a significant number of North Korean artillery batteries, as artillery fire on UN positions waned substantially following the mission. The UN ground and air commanders opposed future massive <b>carpet</b> <b>bombing</b> attacks against enemy tactical troops unless there was precise information on an enemy concentration and the situation was critical. Instead, they recommended fighter-bombers and dive bombers would better support ground forces.|$|E

5|$|The bloody {{fighting}} obliged Paik to {{call for}} emergency reinforcements to hold the line. The Eighth Army responded immediately by sending the US 27th Infantry {{as well as the}} ROK 10th Regiment from the ROK 8th Division to reinforce the ROK 1st Division's three regiments. US Air Force aircraft also conducted a <b>carpet</b> <b>bombing</b> campaign against the advancing North Korean positions to undetermined effect. Around that time the KPA 15th Division, which had been supporting the KPA 13th Division, withdrew from the front to attack elsewhere, leaving the ROK 1st Division, with the US 27th Infantry, and the KPA 13th Division as principal opponents in the conflict that followed.|$|E
5|$|Back on Earth Nightbeat puzzles out {{the links}} between the Machination's various actions. The {{returned}} Prime attempts to get proactive by moving {{the location of the}} Ark-19, but it is shot down by Sixshot, though the crew survive. The subsequent battle between Prime and Sixshot exposes the Transformers to the world at large and forces the military to call in a <b>carpet</b> <b>bombing</b> strike. The Autobots escape, but Verity and Jimmy are seemingly killed. Elsewhere, Hot Rod and Wheeljack set out to recover Ironhide's body, but are confronted by the Machination's Headmaster army, only escaping due to Wheeljack's gadgets. Hunter escapes his captors and discovers the decapitated but still living head of Sunstreaker. Sunstreaker reveals his mind is being used as the hub for the Machination's army, and Hunter opts to fight back, becoming a Headmaster himself. The Reapers arrive at Earth, attacking the Decepticon base and forcing Megatron to recall Sixshot, while Nova Prime (now known as Nemesis Prime), concerned at the pace of events, dispatches Galvatron to Earth.|$|E

25|$|With {{the threat}} of war in the area, the RAF started {{building}} up their forces in the Far East in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Seletar airfield was the target of <b>carpet</b> <b>bombing</b> when Japanese navy bombers conducted the first air raid on Singapore, sometime after their ground forces invaded Kota Bahru. It was abandoned when the Japanese took Johore Bahru, which brought their artillery in range of the airfield.|$|E
25|$|In {{additional}} to controlling units, players {{may also}} call in tactical aid by spending tactical aid points. Points are primarily earned from destroying enemy units in battle. Tactical Aids allow the player {{to call in}} anything, from airstrikes on enemy positions, the deployment of paratroopers, to launching <b>carpet</b> <b>bombing</b> raids and tactical nuclear strikes. Tactical aids can allow up to three deployments, after which the player must wait until the support has recharged. In the single-player campaign, players are restricted by what tactical aid they can use, which can change during a mission.|$|E
25|$|During World War I, Bassarabescu he {{supported}} the Central Powers and was even appointed Prefect of Prahova County under a German-led occupation. This put his political career on hold until 1925, {{when he joined the}} People's Party. Moving into right-wing populism in the 1930s, Bassarabescu had stints in the National Agrarian Party and the National Christian Party, and joined the official National Renaissance Front in 1939. His last years were spent in seclusion: losing his fortune to Allied <b>carpet</b> <b>bombing,</b> stripped of his Romanian Academy membership by the communist regime, he died suddenly in a road accident.|$|E

50|$|An {{official}} United States Air Force {{record of}} U.S. bombing activity over Indochina from 1964 to 1973 was declassified by U.S. President Bill Clinton in 2000. The report gives {{details of the}} extent of the bombing of Cambodia, as well as of Laos and Vietnam. According to the data, the Air Force began bombing the rural regions of Cambodia along its South Vietnam border in 1965 under the Johnson administration; this was four years earlier than previously believed. The Menu bombings were an escalation of what had previously been tactical air attacks. Newly inaugurated President Richard Nixon authorized for the first time use of long range B-52 heavy bombers to <b>carpet</b> <b>bomb</b> Cambodia.|$|R
25|$|The {{main goal}} of the Republicans was to delay the Nationalist advance until the winter came, nevertheless, then the Legion Condor {{returned}} from the Aragon front and started to bomb the Republican positions.

The Republican troops retreated to Gijón and on 15 October the Solchaga's troops joined up with Aranda's troops.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, Dudayev began {{serving in}} the Soviet Air Force where he rose {{to the rank of}} Major-General, {{becoming}} their first Chechen general. Dudayev served in a strategic bombing unit of the Soviet Air Force in Siberia and Ukraine. He participated in the Soviet war in Afghanistan against the Mujahideen for which he was awarded the Order of the Red Star and the Order of the Red Banner. Reportedly from 1986–87 Dudayev had participated in bombing raids in western Afghanistan. Many of his military and political opponents who questioned his Muslim faith often made reference to his actions against the Mujahideen forces. For example, Sergei Stepashin asserted Dudayev participated in <b>carpet</b> <b>bombing</b> (a statement probably motivated by spite). These allegations were denied by Dudayev himself. Dudayev rose steadily in the Air Force, assuming command of the 326th Heavy Bomber Aviation Division of the Soviet Long Range Aviation at Tartu, Estonia, in 1987 gaining the rank of Major-General. From 1987 through March 1990 commanded nuclear-armed long-range strategic bombers during his post there.|$|E
25|$|Yeltsin {{ordered the}} Russian Army to show restraint, {{but it was}} neither {{prepared}} nor trained for this. Civilian losses quickly mounted, alienating the Chechen population and raising the hostility that they showed towards the Russian forces, even among those who initially supported the Russians' attempts to unseat Dudayev. Other problems occurred as Yeltsin sent in freshly-trained conscripts from neighboring regions rather than regular soldiers. Highly mobile units of Chechen fighters inflicted severe losses on the ill-prepared and demoralized Russian troops. Although the Russian military command ordered to only attack designated targets, {{due to the lack}} of training and experience of Russian forces, they attacked random positions instead, turning into <b>carpet</b> <b>bombing</b> and indiscriminate barrages of rocket artillery, and causing enormous casualties among the Chechen and Russian civilian population. On 29 December, in a rare instance of a Russian outright victory, the Russian airborne forces seized the military airfield next to Grozny and repelled a Chechen armoured counter-attack in the Battle of Khankala; the next objective was the city itself. With the Russians closing in on the capital, the Chechens began to hastily set up defensive fighting positions and grouped their forces in the city.|$|E
50|$|Fighting {{from four}} hilltops, surrounded, and outnumbered nearly ten to one, U.S. forces caused heavy losses on eight enemy battalions, before an aerial {{withdrawal}} under heavy mortar, anti-aircraft, and small arms fire.

Major General (ret) Ben Harrison, then {{the commander of the}} 3rd Brigade of the 101st Airborne at FSB Ripcord, is of the opinion that perhaps the NVA losses at Ripcord, just as their losses of their major offensives of the Ia Drang in 1965 and Tet in 1968, crippled the offensive capability of NVA for two full years, resulting in the delaying of their Easter Offensive from 1971 to 1972.|$|R
