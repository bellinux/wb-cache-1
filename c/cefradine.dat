40|$|The {{main focus}} {{of the present study}} was to {{generate}} information about the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance and various major virulence factors trends in local isolates of Pakistan. Isolation and characterization of Shigella was done by biochemical, serology and molecular methods. In vitro, resistances of 95 Shigella isolates against commonly used antimicrobial agents were studied by disc diffusion method. Presence/absence of 15 most commonly related genes and prevalence of integrons 1, 2 and 3 were screened by polymerase chain reaction. Among Shigella species, Sh. flexneri was found to be the most prevalent and significantly more resistant. Collectively, high resistance was found against ampicillin (96. 84 %), tetracycline (93. 68 %), streptomycin (77. 89 %) and chloramphenicol (72. 63 %). Significant emerging resistance was detected against modern frontline drugs; ciprofloxacin (12. 63 %), <b>cefradine</b> (17. 89 %), cefixime (28. 42 %), ceftriaxone (20. 00 %), and cefoperazone (22. 10 %). Class 2 integrons (42. 10 %) were most common. Prevalence rates for blaTEM, blactx-M, gyrA, gyrB, aadA 1, stra &b, tetA, tetB, catA and catP were 78. 94 %, 12. 63 %, 20. 00 %, 21. 05 %, 67. 36 %, 42. 10 %, 12. 63 %, 53. 68 %, 33. 68 %and 25. 26 % respectively. Pathogenicity of shigellae was checked by detection of virulence genes responsible for adhesion, colonization and penetration (ial and IpaH genes); and exotoxin (stx) and enterotoxins (SHET- 1 A, SHET- 1 B and SHET- 2) production. The prevalence of ial and IpaH genes were 50. 52 %(48 isolates) and 100 %(95 isolates) respectively while stx was found in 12. 63 %(12 isolates) of Shigella. Among enterotoxins SHET- 2 was detected in 46. 31 %(44 isolates) whereas both SHET- 1 A & SHET- 1 B were present in 21. 05 %(20 isolates) each. The present study suggests that Sh. flexneri and Sh. dysenteriae have significantly increased prevalence of virulence genes and Sh. flexneri is found to be the most resistant species.

Resistance to cephalothin, cephalexin and cefazoline ranged from 76 % to 96 % among the test bacteria. On the other hand, the majority of the isolates were sensitive to cefoxitime, ceftizoxime and ceftriaxone (84 - 100 %). β-lactamases from all bacteria were inhibited by clavu-lanic acid and none harbored extended spectrum β-lactamases as shown by the double disc diffusion method.

A common bacterial disease caused by A. veronii has appeared in cultured channel catfish producing symptoms of erythema, hemorrhages, skin ulcers and high mortality (˃ 30 %) in China, causing great economic loss. From 2007 to 2013, diseased channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, displaying symptoms of septicemia, ulceration, or abdominal dropsy were collected from Southwestern China. The goals {{of this study were}} to identify the bacterial strains isolated from diseased fish and to determine the susceptibility of the pathogenic strains to many currently available antimicrobial agents. 18 bacterial isolates were obtained from diseased fish. Based on phenotypic characteristics and 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis, all isolates were identified as A. veronii. These results indicate that the microbiological risk posed by A. veronii is considerable for channel catfish cultured in Southwestern China. Susceptibility of the isolates to antibiotics was tested using the agar dilution method. All 18 A. veronii isolates were sensitive to florfenicol, norfloxacin and chloramphenicol, and were resistant to <b>cefradine,</b> clindamycin, midecamycin, penbritin, and amoxicillin. There were sensitivity diversities of the 18 A. veronii isolates to other test antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole, deoxycycline, gentamycin, tobramycin, and more. This in vitro study provides enough data to recommend the use of these antibiotics for treating infectious diseases caused by A. veronii...|$|E
40|$|Background: Acute {{mastitis}} is {{an acute}} infectious disease of breast. Antibiotic treatment is often unable {{to obtain a}} good effect, and we should actively look for a safe and effective non-drug therapy. Objective: To validate the clinical efficacy of kneading and dispersing manipulation in treatment of early-stage acute mastitis. Design, setting, participants and interventions: According to the multicenter randomized controlled trial design, 198 cases of acute mastitis from Yueyang Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese Medicine, Longhua Hospital, and Shanghai Yangpu Maternity and Child Health Hospital were randomly divided into treatment group and control group. There were 99 cases in each group. Patients in the treatment group were only treated with manipulation, and <b>cefradine</b> was orally administered to patients in the control group. Main outcome measures: The local breast lump size, clinical symptoms and the adverse reactions {{in the two groups}} were observed before and after the treatment. Results: The total response rates in the treatment and control group were 95. 92 % (94 / 98) and 80 % (76 / 95) respectively. There was {{a significant difference in the}} total response rate between the two groups (P< 0. 05). There were significant differences in the score of breast lump size, and the score of signs and symptoms between the two groups (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Kneading and dispersing manipulation has certain effects on early-stage acute mastitis, and the therapy is safe and repeatable...|$|E
