5|$|An edited {{version of}} the musical <b>cue</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Tar Sequence (where the inmates are energetically paving the road) {{has been used for}} years as the theme music for local {{television}} stations' news programs around the world, mostly those owned and operated by ABC in the United States. Although the music was written for the film, it became more familiar for its association with television news, in part because its staccato melody resembles the sound of a telegraph.|$|E

25|$|Much of Melton's {{professional}} career has involved literary and field research into alternative and minority religious bodies. In taking his <b>cue</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> writings of Elmer Clark, Melton {{has spent much}} of his career identifying, counting and classifying the many different churches, major religious traditions, and new and alternative religions found in North America. His Encyclopedia of American Religions, which was originally published in 1978 (ninth ed. 2016), has become the standard reference work in the field.|$|E
25|$|Taking his <b>cue</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Jewish {{community}} leader Wilhelm Filderman, Aderca reacted against the branding of Jews as inherent anti-Romanians, placing ethnic clashes {{in a larger}} context, where Romanians also battled each other. He was bitter that Jews were being stereotyped as fainthearted; he mentioned lists of Jews who had fought and died for Romania in World War I. During Octavian Goga's premiership, which reintroduced racial discrimination, Aderca issued calls for democratic dissent, suggesting a compendium of Jewish Romanian literary contributions, past and present.|$|E

25|$|In France, {{during the}} long 1643–1715 reign of Louis XIV, billiard tables were narrowed, with wooden pins or {{skittles}} {{at one end of}} the table, and players would shoot balls with a stick or <b>cue</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other end, in a game inspired as much by bowling as billiards. Pins took too long to reset when knocked down, so they were eventually fixed to the table, and holes in the bed of the table became the targets. Players could ricochet balls off the pins to achieve the harder scorable holes. A standardized version of the game eventually became known as bagatelle.|$|E
25|$|The {{new wave}} scene has {{collapsed}} {{by the end}} of the eighties, to be replaced by the newcomers like; Tutti Frutti band, Daleka Obala, Majke and Laufer. While Daleka Obala sported a pop-rock sound influenced by Novi val, Croatian pop and even Dalmatian folk, Majke were a back-to-basics, garage-rock act stylistically influenced by bands like the Black Crowes, Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath, as well as their Serbian counterparts Partibrejkers. Laufer, led by Damir Urban (who later went on to form Urban & 4), were an early nineties alternative rock band taking their <b>cue</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> grunge movement.|$|E
25|$|Remuneration for the Chief Executive of Hong Kong {{is among}} the highest in the world for a {{political}} leader, and second only to that of the Prime Minister of Singapore. The pay level took a <b>cue</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> handsome amounts paid to the city's colonial governors – worth $273,000 per annum plus perks in 1992 – and is 25 times more than that of Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China. In 2005, then-CE CH Tung received some HK$3million ($378,500). From 2009 until the end of 2014, the salary for the job stood at HK$4.22million. In January 2015, CY Leung reversed a pay freeze imposed in 2012, resulting in its increase to HK$4.61million ($591,000).|$|E

25|$|In this view, {{the beast}} {{from the sea}} is {{interpreted}} as the state or any human kingdom that is in opposition to God. This would include the Roman Empire but would broadly apply to all empires. Scholars take their <b>cue</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> parallels between Revelation 13 and Daniel 7, noting that in Daniel 7:17 that the beasts are revealed as kingdoms. Therefore, given that the beast of Revelation thirteen is a composite of the beasts of Daniel, one should similarly interpret this beast as a kingdom, more specifically a composite of all kingdoms. Similarly, in some idealist circles, {{it is suggested that}} the beast represents different social injustices, such as exploitation of workers, wealth, the elite, commerce, materialism, and imperialism. Various Christian anarchists, such as Jacques Ellul, have associated the State and political power as the beast.|$|E
25|$|In 220 BC Demetrius and the Illyrian commander, Scerdilaidas sailed {{south of}} Lissus with ninety lembi. After {{an assault on}} Pylos in the western Peloponnese had failed they {{separated}} their forces, with Demetrius taking his chances in plundering the Cyclades while Scerdilaidas returned north. On putting in at Naupactus with forty ships Scerdilaidas was encouraged by his broth-in-law Amynas, king of the Athamanes, to join the Aetolians in their planned invasion of Achaea. With help from Cynaethan traitors, they attacked, seized and burned Cynaetha, a town {{in the north of}} Arcadia, located on the northern slope of the Aroanian Mountains. They also attacked but failed to take Cleitor. Meanwhile, Demetrius continued on into the Aegean with 50 ships. He sailed to the Cyclades, where he extorted tribute from some of the islands and plundered the others. Chased by Rhodian warships, Demetrius put into Cenchreae, the Aegean port of Corinth. At the same time the Macedonian commander in Corinth, Taurion, learned of Scerdilaidas' and the Aetolians' invasion. Taking his <b>cue</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Aetolians, Taurion agreed to drag Demetrius' ships across the Isthmus to bring them into play in the Gulf of Corinth, in return for Demetrius' assistance against the Aetolians. Although Demetrius conducted a few raids on the Aetolian coast, he was too late to hinder the Aetolians' return from Achaea.|$|E

He further {{commented that the}} song is [...] "genuine happy-feeling. It sounds lame at first but {{pay attention to what}} she's singing; that vocal smile changes everything." [...] "She even makes a bid for gay icon status", wrote Neil McCormick in a review of The Velvet Rope for The Daily Telegraph, [...] "delivering a diva-ish performance reminiscent of Diana Ross on 'Together Again'." ...|$|E

She recalled that [...] "every time I was in a scene where I wasn’t quite sure where I was going with it, I would go to the book and read through the lines because she's unreliable, in that much of the time she's not being truly honest with herself or the audience." [...] The young actress said that her friendship with Knightley made their scenes together easier because they would both regard each other's comments helpful and would not feel [...] "insulted or hurt" [...] in discussion.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, several Michigan bands rooted in garage rock {{recorded}} a works that became highly influential, {{particularly with the}} 1970s punk movement. [...] In 1969, MC5 issued their live debut LP, Kick Out the Jams, which featured a set of highly energetic, politically-charged songs. [...] The Stooges, from Ann Arbor were fronted by lead singer Iggy Pop, [...] Describing their approach, Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented: [...] "Taking their <b>cue</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> over-amplified pounding of British blues, the primal raunch of American garage rock, and the psychedelic rock (as well as the audience-baiting) of the Doors, the Stooges were raw, immediate, and vulgar." [...] The group released three albums during this period, beginning with the self-titled The Stooges in 1969 and culminating with Raw Power (now billed as Iggy and the Stooges) in 1973, which featured the cathartic opeing cut, [...] "Search and Destroy". [...] The Alice Cooper band relocated to Detroit, where they began to gain success with a new [...] "shock rock" [...] image, and recorded 1971's Love It to Death, which featured their breakout hit [...] "I'm Eighteen".|$|E
500|$|While such {{reactions}} were observed on the Internet, youth activism took to streets to protest on public interest issues. A direct impact {{was on the}} 1999 Jessica Lall Murder Case, one of the high-profile murder cases in India. A month after the film's release, a court acquitted the main accused because of inefficient prosecution and hostile witnesses. This sparked intense civil protests and media campaigns that sought his re-arrest. Taking <b>cue</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> scene in which the protagonists hold a silent, candlelight vigil at New Delhi's India Gate, one such group of demonstrators carried out a similar rally to voice their protest. Shortly thereafter, a survey was conducted to assess reasons for the sudden upsurge in people's social involvements. Eighteen {{percent of the respondents}} felt that movies like Rang De Basanti were the main reason behind it. Another such massive youth activism was seen in the Priyadarshini Mattoo rape and murder case where similar rallies were organized in India, United States and around the world. Following the release of the film, another social outcry was against the introduction of reservations for socially backward classes in educational institutions. Young doctors and engineers joined hands in peaceful rallies in major cities across India. Though the film was not released in the neighbouring Pakistan, it evoked similar reactions there. Inspired by the film, Pakistan's national newspaper, Jang, launched a television channel that was to focus on citizens' issues and support public awakening. Reacting to these strong social reactions, actor Kunal Kapoor thought that the film was just a catalyst that presented [...] "patriotism in a package that the youngsters understood and empathised with".|$|E
