The supporting power of a soil or rock {{is referred to as}} its bearing capacity. Reinforced earth is a composite material, a combination of soil and reinforcement suitably placed in layers to resist tensile stresses. In case of soft soils geogrid is one which redistributes the stresses internally with locally available backfill materials. Ground improvement technique using geosynthetic material i. e. geogrid is done below foundation.

Reinforcement of soil to improve the ground (weak soil) using a polymeric geosynthetic material i. e. <b>coated</b> <b>yarn</b> geogrid is applied below a square footing. To reduce the foundation settlement, bearing capacity of soil increased.

40|$|The latest {{technological}} advances in new materials and devices enabled wearable systems {{to be created}} by utilizing textile solutions. These solutions require electro-conductive yarns as a basic component. Although the production of electro-conductive yarn is widely reported, research is still necessary to characterize them to advance their electro-conductive and mechanical properties. Hence, we served this need and characterized copper-coated para-aramid yarns produced by an in-house developed electroless deposition method. In this paper we present our investigation on the yarn's copper layer characteristics after deposition. Furthermore, we looked, in depth, at the yarn's electro-conductive properties before and after washing {{as well as their}} mechanical properties before and after copper deposition. We found a dependency of the copper layer morphology on its deposition time.

40|$|In our times, when {{electricity}} and electrical devices are around us every day, {{it is very}} important to be protected from electrostatic discharge. The best protection from electric charge dissipation provides conductive textile materials. For the last few decades fine and flexible conductive yarns were developed, which ensure very good electrostatic properties. Unfortunately, due to their chemical nature, these yarns do not distinguish good comfort properties. The main purpose of development of such textiles is to determine the influence of conductive yarns and hollow fiber yarns arrangements in the middle layer of the three layer weft-knitted fabrics to electrostatic and comfort properties. So, in order to have flexible textile materials with good electrostatic and comfort properties, multifunctional three layer weft-knitted fabrics of combined pattern were designed and manufactured for this research work. Two groups of polyester based three layer knitted fabrics with different arrangement of conductive yarns (such as carbon core yarn and polyester silver <b>coated</b> <b>yarn)</b> and polyester yarn of special design (Coolmax®, Thermolite®) were investigated. The parameters of electrostatic characteristics, such as surface and vertical resistances as well as charge decay properties were measured. The results have showed that all tested fabrics have excellent shielding properties. The main influence on the electrostatic properties of tested fabrics has the arrangement of conductive carbon core yarns inserted in the knits. In order to evaluate the comfort of knitted fabrics the air permeability, hygroscopicity, time of absorption and drying degree of fabrics were evaluated. It was determined, that the values of comfort parameters depend on the quantity and distribution of Coolmax® and Thermolite® yarns in the fabrics. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Textiles are {{increasingly}} studied {{to use them}} as sensing and measuring devices of body parameters. For this purpose {{they need to be}} modified to provide on the one hand reliable and stable electroconductive properties and on the other they should be biocompatible.

Gold is an ideal material to use as it offers the aforementioned criteria and can be applied as a thin coating on the surface of a fibre, yarn or fabric. We developed gold <b>coated</b> <b>yarns</b> that are highly electrically conductive, skin-friendly and stable.

The in-house developed process allows deposition of micrometric thickness polymeric paste layer on the yarn surface. Barium hexaferrite is a hard magnetic material exhibiting high chemical stability and corrosion resistivity, relatively large saturation and residual magnetization and microwave absorbing properties.

Today, geotextiles are often made of coir fibres, which have a high lignin percentage leading to their slow degradation in soil. Fibres with a high cellulosic content, such as those of flax, exhibit lower resistance to soil degradation. This study investigates solutions to improve this parameter with a view to increasing their service life and therefore their credibility compared to coir fibres for geotextile applications.

It appears that the cellulose coating provides an efficient physical protection, preventing access of these enzymes to their fibrous substrate.

The aim of this work is to investigate fabric sensors which can be integrated into a garment to allow the unobtrusive monitoring of physiological parameters, primarily for measuring the electrocardiograph (ECG) and respiration. The work focuses on using only dry fabric electrodes where skin preparation {{and the use of}} chemical gels or adhesives are not employed. The textile structure used in {{this study was designed to}} provide controlled contact pressure, enable construction using common textile processing methods, allow accurate placement of electrodes on the body, allow comfortable fit and be unobtrusive to wear. It was decided to use the knitting method to make bands which incorporated conductive electrodes in order to evaluate different fabric electrodes materials. The detection of respiration using fabric strain sensors did not require electrical contact with the skin. Preliminary experiments were conducted on a single subject to develop a device and methodology. Galvanic skin response and ECG was initially investigated to determine the effectiveness of electrode materials. ECG was established as a more reliable measure and was subsequently used to evaluate the initial performance of the fabric electrodes, and further refine the test methodology on a single subject. Experiments were then conducted on 10 male volunteer participants of reasonable general health having no known heart conditions, with ages 30 - 55 and BMI 20 - 30. It was found that fabric sensors which were soft, pliable and flexible have advantages in terms of ability to provide better quality ECG signals and a comfortable bio-interface.

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of this {{doctoral}} thesis methods and concepts were examined detecting the wear of textile ropes. Ropes are employed in a variety of applications such as fixation of goods during transportation, on ships, and for sports such as climbing and sailing. To ensure the safety of ropes they are usually inspected by eye, but there is no clear criterion when a rope needs to be replaced. This inspection is expensive and time consuming by expert staff. A sensor system must not causes additional damage in a rope. Therefore, the only possibility was to use sensors which were braided together with other yarns in the rope. Eventually silver <b>coated</b> <b>yarns</b> were employed whose resistance is increased by straining and wear. Because of the very different application terms of ropes, only one concept could not satisfy all demands. Instead, different concepts were suitable for different cases. In very thin ropes, as for example parachute tethers, only a single sensor yarn was braided into the tethers. Very long and thick ropes required several sensor yarns and also the possibility to detect multiple breaks of a sensor yarn. Ropes are used predominantly outdoors. Therefore, it was important to know the behaviour of the sensor yarns as a function of temperature and humidity. The experiments showed that the sensor yarn changed its electric resistance permanently by repeated temperature cycles. Also air humidity affects the electric resistance. Therefore, no reliable information about the wear of a rope can be obtained from the measurement of the electrical resistance of a sensor yarn. Hence, it was concluded that the only reliable way of wear measurement is to employ sensor yarns which break at a given load. A break can be also detected a long time afterwards by an easy measurement of the electric resistance of the sensor yarn. It was found out that the strain of the rope at which the sensor yarn breaks {{is a function of the}} position where the sensor yarn was braided into the rope. Beside the measurement of the electrical resistance by contacts at both ends of a rope other methods were examined as for example measuring of the run time of an electric pulse or acoustic signal along the sensor yarn. In addition, wireless reading out textile transponder coils braided into ropes was investigated. For the fabrication of textile transponder coils a fully isolated contact between electrically conducting yarns was required.

40|$|Electrically {{conductive}} or electro-active fibers are the {{key components}} of smart and interactive textiles, {{which could be used}} in medical, sports, energy, and military applications in the near future. The functionalization of high-performance textile yarns/fibers with conjugated polymers can produce conductive fibers with better electro-mechanical properties, which is difficult with commonly used spinning techniques. In this thesis work, textile-based conductive yarns/fibers were prepared by coating viscose and polyester (PET) yarns with the conjugated polymer PEDOT. For coating purposes, an efficient technique called chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was used, which is a solventless technique and can produce PEDOT polymer layers with high conductivity values. The polymerization of EDOT monomer vapors and coating of oxidant (FeCl 3 or FepTS) enriched viscose and PET yarns took place simultaneously. The PEDOT-coated viscose and polyester yarns showed relatively high conductivity values, which could be sufficient for many electronic applications. The polymerization process and the quality of PEDOT polymer strongly depends on different reaction conditions. In this research work, the impact of most of these reaction parameters on the electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties of PEDOT-coated conductive yarns was considered separately. Under specific reaction conditions, it was found that viscose fibers were successfully coated with PEDOT polymer and showed rather high electrical conductivity (≥ 15 S/cm). However, due to the acid hydrolysis of viscose fibers in FeCl 3 solutions, the mechanical properties were drastically reduced. In order to improve the mechanical properties of conductive yarns, a relatively stable and chemical-resistant substrate (PET) was coated with PEDOT polymer. Comparative studies between PEDOT-coated viscose and PET conductive yarns showed that the electrical and mechanical properties were enhanced by changing the substrate material. Later on, PEDOT-coated conductive fibers were treated with silicone elastomer solution and due to the thin silicone layers, the hydrophobic properties, flexibility, and durability of <b>coated</b> <b>yarns</b> was improved. Furthermore, a novel electrical resistance-measuring setup was developed, which can be used not only for fibers but also for fabric structures. The electrical characterization of PEDOT-coated conductive yarns showed that it can be used effectively for sensitive fibers without damaging their surface morphology. Finally, the use of conductive yarns as stretch sensors was evaluated. For this purpose, small rectangular knitted patches of conductive yarns were prepared and then the change in electrical resistance values at different extension percentages (5 – 50 %) was investigated. The constant variations in electrical resistance values at different extension and relaxation cycles {{for longer periods of time}} revealed that the conductive yarns produced have the potential to be used as stretch sensors for monitoring of vital signs in medical and sports applications.

40|$|This paper investigates textile-based {{energy storage}} devices {{fabricated}} with poly(3, 4 -ethylene dioxythiophene) :poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as an electro-active polymer and conductive yarns as the electrodes. The conductive yarns are sewn into a textile substrate and then coated with PEDOT:PSS systematically. Two {{different sets of}} devices were made. A comparison of the devices made with silver <b>coated</b> polybenzoxazol filament <b>yarns</b> and the devices made with pure stainless steel filament yarns is performed. The devices were charged and their self-discharge was measured by voltage decay. A study {{of the influence of}} charging time on the decay and the effect brought by various load resistors on the voltage decay is also performed. In this research, the devices with electrodes of pure stainless steel filaments yarns performed better than the devices with silver coated yarns; this outcome has been reported as standard by various researchers...|$|R
40|$|Wool <b>yarns</b> were <b>coated</b> with {{conducting}} polypyrrole by {{chemical synthesis}} methods. Polymerization of pyrrole {{was carried out}} in the presence of wool yarn at various concentrations of the monomer and dopant anion. The changes in tensile, moisture absorption, and electrical properties of the <b>yarn</b> upon <b>coating</b> with conductive polypyrrole are presented. <b>Coating</b> the wool <b>yarns</b> with conductive polypyrrole resulted in higher tenacity, higher breaking strain, and lower initial modulus. The changes in tensile properties are attributed to the changes in surface morphology due to the coating and reinforcing effect of conductive polypyrrole. The thickness of the coating increased with the concentration of p-toluene sulfonic acid, which in turn caused a reduction in the moisture regain of the wool yarn. Reducing the synthesis temperature and replacing p-toluenesulfonic acid by anthraquinone sulfonic acid resulted in a large reduction in the resistance of the yarn. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The most {{effective}} way to reduce the thermal signature is to reduce the emissivity. The goal of our research is to create the material, which can reduce the thermal signature, and make it interflow with environment. The materials and material compositions concealing the thermal signature of the object were developed using aluminium coatings and conductive metalized fibres, i. e. yarns with stainless steel staples or coated with silver. The analysis of the prepared samples was carried out with equipment consisting of a stand with integrated heating controller imitating the human body. The concealing properties of the samples in the far infrared (FIR) spectral range were evaluated using ThermaCAM Reporter 7. 0. The thermal signature analysis of prepared samples demonstrates that respectable results could be obtained using <b>yarns</b> <b>coated</b> with silver and materials coated with aluminium, but the first one is more flexible and preferable for clothing.

40|$|By the {{integration}} of electro-conductive properties in the fabric structure can be obtained a flexible textile that does not reduce the quality of comfort, maintenance and wearability of clothing. Each type of yarns has its advantages and disadvantages: metal <b>coated</b> polymer multifilament <b>yarns</b> have a lower resistance to heat than metal multifilament yarns, but they are more flexible. For the experiments are chosen more suitable yarns for knitting with a lower resistance: silver coated multifilament polyamide, stainless steel multifilament yarns and polyester/stainless steel spun yarn. For the tensile experiments were knitted patterns of non-conducting yarn and horizontal loop rows of conducting yarn. Experimental results show different behavior of the knitted conductive yarn by stretching: electric resistance declines {{for most of the}} knitted samples; resistance is lower by samples, where are used only conductive yarns; for creating a knitted heating element are suitable yarns, which do not change electrical properties of knitted fabric by stretching...|$|R
