25|$|Despite these changes, the Z8 {{remained}} extremely {{faithful to}} the concept car. The side-mounted turn indicators were integrated into the side vents in a fashion that rendered them invisible until activated. The vintage simplicity of the interior was preserved by hiding the modern equipment under retracting panels. Complex compound curves were preserved {{through the use of}} an expensive MIG-welded aluminum space frame. The Z8 even retained the concept's five-spoke wheel design, albeit without the race-style <b>center</b> lug <b>nut.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a novel deformation of the 3 -dimensional sigma model with hyperkähler target, which arises naturally from the compactification of a 4 -dimensional N = 2 theory on a hyperkähler circle bundle (Gibbons-Hawking space). We derive the condition {{for which the}} deformed sigma model preserves 4 out of the 8 supercharges. We also study the contribution from a <b>NUT</b> <b>center</b> to the sigma model path integral, and find that supersymmetry implies it is a holomorphic section of a certain holomorphic line bundle over the hyperkähler target. We study explicitly the case where the original 4 -dimensional theory is pure U(1) super Yang-Mills, and show that the contribution from a <b>NUT</b> <b>center</b> {{in this case is}} simply the Jacobi theta function...|$|R
40|$|We study an N = 2 N= 2, pure U(1) SYM {{theory on}} a Gibbons-Hawking space Ω-deformed using the U(1) isometry. The {{resultant}} 3 D theory, after an appropriate “Nekrasov-Witten” change of variables, is asymptotically {{equivalent to the}} undeformed theory at spatial infinity but differs from it as one approaches the <b>NUT</b> <b>centers</b> which are fixed points under the U(1) action. The 3 D theory may be recast {{in the form of}} a generalized hyperkähler sigma model introduced in [1] where the target space is a one-parameter family of hyperkähler spaces. The hyperkähler fibers have a preferred complex structure which for the deformed theory depends on the parameter of Ω-deformation. The metric on the hyperkähler fiber can be reduced to a standard metric on ℂ × T 2 C×T^ 2 with the modular parameter of the torus depending explicitly on the Ω-deformation parameter. The contribution of the <b>NUT</b> <b>center</b> to the sigma model path integral, expected to be a holomorphic section of a holomorphic line bundle over the target space on grounds of supersymmetry, turns out to be a Jacobi theta function in terms of certain “deformed” variables...|$|R
5000|$|The Agera has a body {{made from}} {{impregnated}} carbon fiber/kevlar with lightweight reinforcements. The car's hardtop roof is stowable under the front hood lid. The chassis is also {{made out of}} carbon fiber with an aluminum honeycomb structure that comes with integrated fuel tanks for optimal weight distribution and safety. The rear wing is electronically adjustable with auto setting or manual control {{in order to have}} as little compromise as possible between low drag and downforce, depending on situation and mood. The Agera comes with forged aluminum wheels with <b>center</b> locking <b>nuts,</b> measuring 19" [...] on the front and 20" [...] on the back and wrapped in a set of Michelin Super Sport tyres that can be used with speeds of up to 260 mi/h km/h. Other highlights include the trademark Koenigsegg doors, a new traction control system, LED lighting, blue hood stripes that continue on through the cockpit of the car and a custom interior with a new [...] "Ghost light" [...] lighting system, which uses carbon nanotubes in a unique configuration to shine through the car's aluminum buttons.|$|R
50|$|The city holds annual Vacaville Fiesta Days, {{that happen}} downtown, which {{includes}} a parade that features the public school marching bands, gymnasts, and even an electric car showcase, among other things. Other sites for tourists include the Vacaville Premium Outlets and the Nut Tree, which {{is home to a}} train for children, a carousel, and even a life-size checkerboard, as well as numerous stores and dining establishments. Every Friday during the summer the city holds the Creek Walk in Down Town Vacaville. Every December, the city holds a Festival of Trees in the ice skating rink and the Tree Lighting Ceremony, in which residents of Vacaville gather downtown to see a 50 ft tree illuminate and enjoy festive music played by the Jepson Band, hot chocolate, and horse-drawn carriage rides. The Jimmy Doolittle <b>Center</b> at the <b>Nut</b> Tree Airport displays aircraft from as early as 1912 and is home to the Jimmy Doolittle Shell Lockheed Vega. Displays also include personal items of General Doolittle and items related to the Doolittle Raid of 1942.|$|R
50|$|The sweeper is a low-to-the-ground {{machine that}} makes two passes in each tree row. It has a 2 m belt {{attached}} to the front that rotates to sweep leaves, nuts, and small twigs from left to right, depositing the material {{in the center of}} the row as it drives forward. On the rear of the sweeper is a powerful blower to blow material left into the adjacent row with air speeds up to 90 m/s. Careful grooming during the year and patient blowing at harvest may eliminate the need for hand raking around the trunk of the tree, where nuts may accumulate. The sweeper prepares a single <b>center</b> row of <b>nuts</b> narrow enough for the harvesting tractor to drive over without driving on the center row. It is best to sweep only a few rows ahead of the harvesters at any given time, to prevent the tractor that drives the harvester from crushing the nuts that may still be falling from the trees. Hazelnut orchards may be harvested up to three times during the harvest season, depending on the quantity of nuts in the trees and the rate of nut drop as a result of weather.|$|R
50|$|When {{using this}} type of stator design, lining the slot with {{insulation}} paper is not required. The plastic end plates are designed {{in a way that}} the sides of the injected shafts insulate half of the stator slot. It is also beneficial, that costs for paper as well as costs for the production process for the mounting of the paper do not arise. Under consideration of a certain wall thickness of these injected shafts, z-shaped overlapping of the shafts in the area of the stator <b>nut</b> <b>center</b> may be achieved in order to increase the creepage distance and clearance to avoid dielectric breakdowns. However, a disadvantage constitutes in the fact that the depth of the shot of the injection process is limited depending on the stator lengths and the plastic material used.When e.g. using PA with a solid material content (e.g. glass fibers) of approx. 25% and a shot of approx. 25 mm depth, a wall thickness of at least 0.5 mm may be achieved. However, it has negative repercussions on the fill factor compared to the use of insulation paper which e.g. is only 0.1 mm thick.|$|R
5000|$|The Cronaca fiorentina {{explains}} that the spice-dealers and beccamorti sold burial items, such as perfumed spiced goods, benches, caskets, burial palls, biers, and cushions, at outrageously high prices, so that the government finally had {{to step in and}} control such prices. It also forbade the custom of ringing bells during a funeral, to limit the knowledge of how many funerals there actually were. Crying out a funeral announcement was also forbidden. Knowing how many funerals there were discouraged the sick as well as the healthy. Priests and friars served the rich, since they were paid large amounts of money for their services, and could become rich themselves. The local authorities then made laws prescribing how many clerics a church could have, usually setting the limit at six. Many rich people died, and many religious processions with relics went through the streets of Florence. The dead would be carried away by four beccamorti and a tonsured clerk carrying a Christian cross, each wanting to be highly paid. Bonaiuti makes it clear that the plague killed so many people that certain new customs were put into place. Fruits with a <b>nut</b> <b>center,</b> unhusked almonds, figs, and [...] "unhealthy" [...] fruits were forbidden to enter Florence, for fear of bringing in the pestilence. Men would gather and dine together. Each evening a man would provide the cooked meal for ten other men, rotating from night to night as the host. Many times a host would provide dinner for ten, but two or three were missing. Often by the next evening only one of the ten was still present, the other nine having died or having fled the city for villages outside it, to get fresh air, but they took the plague with them and contaminated otherwise healthy villages. Thus the pestilence spread, killing people at an ever faster rate.|$|R
