Even for {{a limited number of}} windings this geometry provides a reasonable homogeneous B1 field and a good filling factor is possible by winding the coil directly onto a holder containing the sample. Miniaturization to a scale of several hundred micrometers (µm) is not very difficult although the wire diameter (typically 20 to 50 µm) becomes very small and a freestanding coil is a very delicate object.A reduction to below 100 µm diameter is possible but the machining and handling of such coils will be rather tedious. For this reason other microsystem fabrication technology such as bulk micromachining, LIGA and micro-injection molding should be applied.For solenoid coils adding more turns to the coil will enhance the B1/i ratio and thus both the inductance and the signal response. At the same time the <b>coil</b> <b>resistance</b> will increase linearly, so the improvement in sensitivity will be proportional to the square root of the number of turns (n). At the same time we will have a larger ohmic heating at the center ofthe coil and an enhanced danger for arcing, so the optimum is generally found for {{only a limited number of}} turns. Besides RF performance, static field distortions due to susceptibility effects are an important factor in the design of microcoil probeheads.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a head servo-positioning system for hard disk drives (HDDs), {{in which the}} usual current command for the voice coil motor {{has been replaced by}} a simpler voltage command. This solution has proven advantages in terms of cost, since the voltage driver does not require any resistive shunt for current measurement and phase-shaping passive networks for the current controller. Also, it requires a lower pin count and can be easily implemented with a PWM power stage. The voltage driver consists of a voltage-controlled power stage, with a pre-filter placed at its input, plus a back e. m. f. feed-forward compensator. The role of the pre-filter is to provide a transfer function between input signal and VCM current as close as possible to that of a standard current loop, so providing a one-to-one replacement to standard current drivers. To achieve this, it can be shown that the filter must cancel out the low-frequency pole of the VCM, located in a position which depends on the electrical impedance of the VCM itself. This, however, may change by ± 30 % during HDD operations, due to self-heating and consequent variation of the VCM resistance. Such variation may lead to an unsatisfactory performance of the voltage driver, so an adaptation mechanism, capable of tracking variations of VCM <b>coil</b> <b>resistance,</b> must be set up. This paper presents an on-line estimation procedure, based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF), capable of estimating the VCM <b>coil</b> <b>resistance</b> with a high degree of accuracy. EKF, however, usually brings a high computational load, making it unsuitable for real-time, low-cost embedded applications. The paper presents two reduced-order model of the VCM, for which the EKF can be implemented with 30 and 50 % less computational effort, respectively, while maintaining a good estimate of the VCM <b>coil</b> <b>resistance.</b> The paper reports experimental results of VCM resistance estimation, obtained with the proposed algorithm, running in 30 S on a 25 MHz, fixed-point DSP. Also, the on-line estimation is used to adapt the pre-filter. Experimental results show that the servo performance with adaptive voltage driver is not affected by resistance variation and equivalent to that of the standard current driver...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a new voltage driven head servo-positioning system for hard disk drives (HDDs) called Voice Coil Model-based Control (VCMC). Previous works [1],[2] {{have shown that}} the usual current amplifier used in driving the voice coil motor can be replaced by a simpler system, consisting a power voltage amplifier driven by an adaptive, multi-rate, zero-pole pre-filter that cancels out the VCM electrical pole. This fully digital solution can be implemented by using a switching power stage in place of the standard linear high power operational amplifier, with savings in both silicon area and power dissipation. The latter is further reduced with the voltage driver, since {{there is no need for}} the shunt resistor, placed in series to the VCM as a current sensor. The major drawback exhibited by a voltage driven HDDs is that the dynamics of the system to be controlled depend on the variations of the VCM <b>coil</b> <b>resistance.</b> Moreover, previous realizations, based on a multi-rate zero-pole pre-filter, did not account for the saturation of the driving power amplifier, causing a performance worsening for seeks with average size span. The drawback related to the dependence on the variations of motor resistance has been partially solved in [2], where the pre-filter is tuned at start-up, using the estimated VCM <b>coil</b> <b>resistance</b> given by an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). This solution, however, presents a high computational complexity and cannot account for resistance variations when the HDD is in idle mode or during track following operations. During these phases, in fact, signal-to-noise ratio results not to be high enough to guarantee EKF convergence. The solutions proposed in this paper address all these issues. The VCMC is based on a new multi-rate pre-filter, which replicates the behavior of a current loop by using a model of the voice coil motor and its driver, including the saturation of the power stage. The performance obtained, when it is fully tuned, is the same as a current driven HDD during all operational phases. As for the pre-filter tuning, during seek operations, an adaptive algorithm based on a simplified least-square identification procedure, maintains the same performance level of the EKF with a lower computational complexity. Finally, several methods for estimating the value of VCM <b>coil</b> <b>resistance</b> during idle mode and track following operations will be compared. They are all based on the analysis of the information given by position error signal and VCM input. Experimental results, including those related to resistance estimation, will be presented in the final paper, showing that HDD servo-positioning performance obtained with the VCMC matches that obtained with a standard current loop, in both seek and track following operations...|$|E

To achieve the same performance of the current driver, the voltage driver requires a pre-filter placed at its input, to cancel out the electrical pole of the VCM. In the paper, {{we describe}} the voice coil model-based control (VCMC), a solution for implementing the pre-filter, which replicates the behavior of a current loop by using a model of the voice coil motor and its driver, including the saturation of the power stage. It is worth noticing that VCM resistance may change by 30 % during HDD operations, increasing when the disk is performing repetitive seeks or decreasing when the disk cools down during track following. Such variation may lead to an unsatisfactory performance of the VCMC, so an adaptation mechanism, capable of tracking variations of VCM <b>coil</b> <b>resistance,</b> must be set up.

40|$|Lead acid {{batteries}} {{are widely used}} in domestic, industrial and automotive applications. Even after lot of advancements in battery technologies, lead acid cells are still in use because of their high capacity and low cost. To use any battery effectively, first {{we should be able}} to identify the available capacity or State of Charge (SoC). There are many techniques available to measure SoC of a lead acid battery. One such unique method is to measure the capacity using eddy current sensors. This method is unique because it is non-obtrusive and online. Eddy current sensors (ECS) are wire wound inductors which work on the principle of electromagnetic induction. Eddy currents are the currents generated on a conductive material when it is kept in a varying magnetic. Eddy current sensors generate varying magnetic eldest and will be able to identify the properties of conductive materials like thickness, conductivity, material composition etc. Also they can be used as proximity sensors. Lead acid batteries use lead metal as cathode. Upon usage(discharge) the lead metal converts to lead sulfate and revert back to lead after charging. These changes in lead electrode can be monitored using eddy current sensors. The impedance of an eddy current sensor will change when it is kept close to the lead electrode when the battery is charging or discharging. These impedance parameters can be monitored to determine the battery SoC. When lead is deposited on cathode, there will be more eddy current loss in the target and the total resistance of coil increases. On the other hand, when lead is deposited on the electrode because of increase in the magnitude of eddy currents which oppose the source magnetic, the total inductance of coil decreases. We can observe exactly opposite behaviour of <b>coil</b> <b>resistance</b> and inductance when the lead electrode is converted to less conductive lead sulfate. There is a lot of research on using ECS to measure SoC of lead acid batteries and there are still many challenges to be addressed. First we have explained about different circuit designs we have used to monitor the battery capacity using eddy current sensors. After that, we have explained about our complete experimental setup and the procedure to measure the sensor parameters using the setup. Then, we have discussed about different issues involved in the eddy current sensing based state of charge measurement. Eddy current sensors are affected by temperature variations. We have studied the <b>coil</b> <b>resistance</b> behaviour with temperature at different frequencies using simulations and experiments. We have obtained the conditions for linear variation of <b>coil</b> <b>resistance</b> with temperature. The measured temperature compensation scheme is applied and the results are discussed. We have also modified the measurement system design in order to minimize the lift o errors. We have used a metallic clamp structure to minimize the lift o errors. We have used finite element analysis based simulations to study different design parameters and their effect on the sensitivity of eddy current sensor. We have created 2 D eddy current models and the sensitivity of <b>coil</b> <b>resistance</b> is computed by changing the coil dimensions and the core permeability.
