50|$|Physis {{refers to}} the {{physical}} modeling technology developed by Viscount. Two series of organs have been produced with Physis technology {{at the time of}} this writing: Unico and Unico CL. The latter being a stripped-down version of the former. Unico organs are based only on physical modeling synthesis, hence they no longer use sampling technology, currently the most common synthesis technology for musical instruments. Unico organs also feature a Linux-powered <b>core</b> <b>controller,</b> hence it is capable of managing USB devices such as USB sticks, and several DSPs for the sound synthesis.With these new products, Viscount seems to have gained back some popularity in the USA, after a demo tour featuring Cameron Carpenter as a player.|$|E

50|$|<b>Core</b> memory <b>controllers</b> were {{designed}} so that every read was followed immediately by a write (because the read forced all bits to 0, and because the write assumed this had happened). Computers began {{to take advantage of}} this fact. For example, a value in memory could be read with post-increment almost as quickly as it could be read; the hardware simply incremented the value between the read phase and the write phase of a single memory cycle (perhaps signalling the memory controller to pause briefly in the middle of the cycle). This might be twice as fast as the process of obtaining the value with a read-write cycle, incrementing the value in some processor register, and then writing the new value with another read-write cycle.|$|R
