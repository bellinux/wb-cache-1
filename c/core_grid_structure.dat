40|$|<b>Grid</b> <b>structures</b> are {{intended}} to aid graphic designers by providing a foundation for consistent communication; however, the usage of <b>grid</b> <b>structures</b> is rapidly descending. Numerous designers have expressed concern regarding habitual layouts produced by traditional grid design, and many have discarded the grid altogether. Because the grid is an organizational device, which allows for easy collaboration and faster communication, {{it is important that}} it not be abandoned. Not only does this thesis examine the evolution of grid design, it also discusses its potential future. By establishing a methodological approach to create conceptually dynamic <b>grid</b> <b>structures,</b> non-traditional alternative <b>grid</b> solutions are created.

40|$|Abstract:- The grid-based {{clustering}} algorithm, which partitions {{the data}} space into {{a finite number}} of cells to form a <b>grid</b> <b>structure</b> and then performs all clustering operations on this obtained <b>grid</b> <b>structure,</b> is an efficient clustering algorithm, but its effect is seriously influenced {{by the size of the}} cells. To cluster efficiently and simultaneously, to reduce the influences of the size of the cells, a new grid-based clustering algorithm, called DGD, is proposed in this paper. The main idea of DGD algorithm is to deflect the original <b>grid</b> <b>structure</b> in each dimension of the data space after the clusters generated from this original structure have been obtained. The deflected <b>grid</b> <b>structure</b> can be considered a dynamic adjustment of the size of the original cells, and thus, the clusters generated from this deflected <b>grid</b> <b>structure</b> can be used to revise the originally obtained clusters.

40|$|Abstract:- The grid-based {{clustering}} {{algorithm is}} an efficient clustering algorithm, but its effect is seriously {{influenced by the}} size of the predefined grids and the threshold of the significant cells. The data space will be partitioned into a finite number of cells to form a <b>grid</b> <b>structure</b> and then performs all clustering operations on this obtained <b>grid</b> <b>structure.</b> To cluster efficiently and simultaneously, to reduce the influences of the size of the cells and inherits the advantage with the low time complexity, an Adaptive Crossover-Imaged Clustering Algorithm, called ACICA, is proposed in this paper. The main idea of ACICA algorithm is to deflect the original <b>grid</b> <b>structure</b> in each dimension of the data space after the image of significant cells generated from the original <b>grid</b> <b>structure</b> have been obtained. Because the deflected <b>grid</b> <b>structure</b> can be considered a dynamic adjustment of the size of original cells and the threshold of significant cells, the new image generated from this deflected <b>grid</b> <b>structure</b> will be used to revise the originally obtained significant cells. Hence, the new image of significant cells is projected on the original <b>grid</b> <b>structure</b> to be the crossover image. Finally the clusters will be generated from this crossover image. The experimental results verify that, indeed, the effect of ACICA algorithm is less influenced {{by the size of}} the cells than other grid-based algorithms.

This approach is demonstrated by taking an example free-form dome surface and evolving a set of grid designs, in order to minimise deflection under snow load and maximise buckling load; performance enhancements of 35 - 45 % are achieved over 100 generations.

40|$|The {{detection}} of potentially damaged elements in <b>grid</b> <b>structures</b> is a challenging topic. By using limited measured test data, damage detection for <b>grid</b> <b>structures</b> is {{developed by the}} modal strain energy (MSE) method. Two critical problems are considered in this paper in developing the MSE method to detect potential damage to the <b>grid</b> <b>structure</b> by using limited modal test data. First, an updated mode shape expansion method based on the modal assurance criterion is adopted {{to ensure that the}} modal shape obtained from the reference baseline model is reliable and has explicit physical meanings. Second, after identifying the location of the element damage by the element MSE method with expanded mode shapes, multivariable parameters denoting element damage severity are simultaneously determined. These parameters are included in the column vector and matched with the corresponding element stiffness matrix while the error tolerance value of the Frobenius norm of the column vector is undercontrolled. Finally, a three-dimension numerical model of the <b>grid</b> <b>structure</b> is used to represent different damage cases and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the present method. The application of the three-dimension physical model to a full-scale <b>grid</b> <b>structure</b> is also verified. Analysis results demonstrate that the presented damage detection method effectively locates and quantifies single- and multimember damage in <b>grid</b> <b>structures</b> and can be applied in engineering practice...|$|R

40|$|<b>Grids</b> <b>structures</b> {{which form}} {{the main body}} of the score {{immediately}} project unique notational environments within which performers may operate. The paper aims to understand how and why <b>grid</b> <b>structures</b> are used in contemporary notational practice, to discover differences in the approach to their employment, and how they can influence composer’s decision making. Some of the first instances of <b>grid</b> <b>structures</b> in western experimental music scores are seen in Morton Feldman’s graph pieces from the Projection and Intersection series (1951 - 3). Feldman’s notions of framing material (in his own words, he is not “creating music, it’s already there”) underpin his use of grids, and this provides an analytical approach for the study of scores by more recent composers. Examples from scores by Michael Pisaro, Phill Niblock, John Lely, and the author’s own recent music are reviewed for their individual use of <b>grid</b> <b>structures.</b> In particular, the manner in which <b>grid</b> <b>structures</b> can be used to encompass many parameters, or to focus on one specific parametric variation, is considered. From this, the paper explores what can be conveyed by the use of a grid in {{the main body of}} the score. By including what the composers themselves say about their own use of grids, and related comments from performers, the paper establishes a scholarly insight into the interpretive decisions of musicians prompted by the use of <b>grid</b> <b>structures.</b> To understand further the communicative aspects of <b>grid</b> <b>structures</b> and their use in creative formats, the nature of grids in the visual arts will be discussed. The work of artists such as Agnes Martin, François Morollet, James Hugonin and Hanne Darboven will be presented to identify connections with the use of grids in music notation, and how these are interpreted by the observer. The viewpoints of graphic designers such as Mark Boulton are also included to consider the wide-ranging capabilities of <b>grid</b> <b>structures,</b> providing avenues for further creativity in all areas of musical activity...|$|R

Analysis of papers written by foreign and national scientists and devoted to theoretical, numerical and experimental studies of stress-strain state, influence of different factors on it and geometrical optimization and designing of space <b>grid</b> <b>structures</b> has been conducted in order to achieve the objectives. Space <b>grid</b> <b>structures</b> and, in particular, flat double-layer grid and most frequent nodes have been studied in the paper. The paper contains a short review of the history on development of space <b>grid</b> <b>structures.</b> It has been found that a rapid development of structural designs was caused by scientific and technical progress and, in particular, improvement of physical and mechanical properties of materials, development of calculation methods, application of software systems for simulating behavior of the structure under load, which significantly increased the calculation accuracy and reduced complexity of design. It has been also established that main parameters that have influence on effectiveness of a structural design are geometric dimensions of its modular elements, ratio of its depth to the span. The world experience on development of connection components has been studied in the paper. The paper presents general classification of nodal connections.
