That same year, recon flights were conducted into Hurricane Inez, but there were no seedings. Both the 1967 and 1968 seasons were inactive. Because of that, there were no suitable seeding targets in either of those two seasons.|$|E

5|$|On 5 December 1908, Sunderland {{achieved}} {{their highest}} ever league win, against north-east rivals Newcastle United. They {{won the game}} 9–1; Billy Hogg and George Holley each scored hat-tricks. The club won the league again in 1913, but lost their first FA Cup final 1–0 to Aston Villa, in a very tough loss. This was the closest the club has come to winning the league title and the FA Cup in the same season. Two seasons later the First World War brought the league to a halt. After the league's resumption, Sunderland <b>came</b> <b>close</b> to winning another championship in the 1922–23 season, when they were runners-up to Liverpool. They also <b>came</b> <b>close</b> the following season, finishing third, four points {{from the top of}} the league. The club escaped relegation from the First Division by one point in the 1927–28 season despite 35 goals from Dave Halliday. The point was won in a match against Middlesbrough, and they finished in fifteenth place. Halliday improved his goal scoring to 43 goals in 42 games the following season, an all-time Sunderland record for goals scored in a single season.|$|E

Darlington's captain Andy Crosby was {{proving to be a}} {{formidable}} figure at the heart of his team's defence, but Argyle fashioned another chance to open the scoring just before half-time. A flick on by Evans presented Adrian Littlejohn with the opportunity to redeem his earlier miss, but he dragged his shot wide.|$|E
5|$|Relations between Argentina and Uruguay worsened, {{and both}} nations <b>came</b> <b>close</b> to declaring war on each other, {{although}} neither {{could afford a}} direct military conflict.
