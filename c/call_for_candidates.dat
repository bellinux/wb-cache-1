40|$|In {{response}} to the <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>candidates</b> issued by the National Institute for Standards and Technologies (the Advanced Encryption Standard project) we propose a candidate called DFC as for "Decorrelated Fast Cipher", based on Vaudenay's decorrelation technique that provides provable security against several classes of attacks which include the basic version of Biham and Shamir's Differential Cryptanalysis as well as Matsui's Linear Cryptanalysis. From a practical point of view, this algorithm is naturally very efficient when it is implemented on 64 bit processor based computers. In this paper, we describe the implementation we made of DFC on a very low cost smart card. The performances we obtain proves that DFC is also well suited for low cost devices applications.

30|$|Following the <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>candidates</b> for the 10 th {{generation}} IGRF, we {{produced and}} submitted three main field and three secular variation candidate models. The candidates {{are derived from}} parent models which use a standard quadratic parameterisation in time of the internal Gauss coefficients. External magnetospheric fields are represented by combined parameterisations in Solar Magnetic (SM) and in Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric (GSM) coordinates. Apart from the daily and annual variations caused by these external fields, the model also accounts for induction by Earth rotation in a non-axial external field. The uncertainties of our candidates are estimated by comparing independent models from CHAMP and Èrsted data. The root mean square errors of our main field candidates, for the internal field to spherical harmonic degree 13, {{are estimated to be}} less than 8 nT at the Earth’s surface. Our secular variation candidates are estimated to have root mean square uncertainties of 12 nT per year. A hind-cast analysis of the geomagnetic field for earlier epochs shows that our secular acceleration estimates from post- 2000 satellite data are inconsistent with pre- 2000 acceleration in the field. This could confirm earlier reports of a jerk around 2000.0, with a genuine change in the secular acceleration.|$|E

50|$|Returning {{home again}} in 1953, he entered Vermont statewide politics, serving as Deputy Attorney General {{for the state}} from 1953 to 1955, and Attorney General from 1955 to 1957. In 1956, he was elected Lieutenant Governor, and in 1958 was elected Governor. Stafford's ascent to the {{lieutenant}} governorship and governorship was unusual in {{that he did not}} follow the path of most Vermont Republicans. From the founding of the party in the 1850s, Republicans in Vermont had made use of the Mountain Rule, which <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>for</b> governor and lieutenant governor to alternate between the east and west sides of the Green Mountains, and for governors to serve only two years in office. U.S. Senators were also allocated according to the Mountain Rule, with one from the east and one from the west. Under this system, <b>candidates</b> <b>for</b> governor and lieutenant governor were chosen by the party years in advance, and served in leadership roles in the Vermont General Assembly, including Speaker of the Vermont House of Representatives and President of the Vermont Senate. Stafford is one of Vermont's few governors who did not serve in the legislature. By the late 1950s, the Democratic Party in Vermont was becoming increasingly competitive, and in the 1958 election, Stafford won the governorship over Bernard J. Leddy with only 50.3% of the vote.|$|R

The opposition strongly protested Bongo's continued inclusion in the government. After Interim President Rose Francine Rogombé said that Bongo would be replaced so that all candidates would be {{on an equal footing}} for the election, Interior Minister Jean-François Ndongou was appointed to take over from Bongo as Minister of Defense in an interim capacity when the election campaign officially began on 15 August 2009.|$|R

In a minor reshuffle of the government on 15 August, Biyoghé Mba announced that Interior Minister Jean-François Ndongou was taking over from Bongo as Minister of Defense in an interim capacity, while the Minister of Urban and Regional Planning and the Craft Industry, Norbert Diramba, was taking over from Maganga Moussavou as Minister of Technical Education in an interim capacity.|$|R

30|$|Every 5 years, the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA) {{releases}} a new update {{of what is}} known as the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) model. This model is in fact a series of models providing snapshots of the past main geomagnetic field every 5 years since 1900. A secular variation model is also provided, describing the constant trend predicted for the evolution of the field over the 5 years following the update (see, e.g., Macmillan and Finlay (2011), for a general introduction to IGRF models, and Hulot et al. (2015 a), for more background on geomagnetic field modeling). Every time a new release is due, a dedicated task force is set up by IAGA and an open call issued, inviting the scientific community to produce and propose so-called candidate models. The latest call, issued in May 2014, requested <b>candidate</b> models <b>for</b> the 2015.0 IGRF model and for the 2015.0 – 2020.0 predictive IGRF secular variation model. As is standard practice, it also <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>candidate</b> models <b>for</b> the a posteriori 2010.0 Definitive Geomagnetic Reference Field (DGRF) model, meant to replace the 2010.0 IGRF model provided with the previous 2010 IGRF release (Finlay et al. 2010). All candidate models were requested by the deadline of October 1, 2014. The present paper reports on the production of a 2015.0 IGRF candidate model in response to this call. This model was built from a unique set of data acquired by absolute scalar magnetometers (ASM) running an experimental vector mode on board the satellites of the European Space Agency (ESA) Swarm mission. For reasons later explained, no candidate predictive IGRF secular variation model for the interval 2015.0 – 2020.0 was proposed, but only a test model. As the Swarm mission was only launched on November 22, 2013, no DGRF 2010.0 candidate model was proposed, either.|$|R
