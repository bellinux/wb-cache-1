40|$|Voltage-gated calcium {{channels}} are ubiquitously expressed in neurons and are of vital importance to proper cellular functioning. Calcium entry into cells via activation of voltage-gated calcium channels controls {{a wide variety}} of cellular functions including neurotransmitter release, muscle excitation-contraction coupling, gene regulation and activation of signaling cascades. Regulation of calcium channels via activation of G protein-coupled receptors is a prominent mechanism of calcium <b>current</b> <b>inhibition</b> and neurotransmitter release. An intriguing characteristic of this modulatory pathway is its voltage dependence whereby the degree of calcium <b>current</b> <b>inhibition</b> varies depending on the membrane voltage of the cell, and is susceptible to activity-dependent relief by trains of action potentials. Previously, {{it has been suggested that}} in chick ciliary ganglion neurons, somatostatin inhibits calcium current in a voltage dependent manner. Interestingly, the specific characteristics of the inhibition varied depending on the recording configuration used to collect data. Thus, I measured the voltage-dependence of somatostatin-mediated calcium <b>current</b> <b>inhibition</b> in individual ciliary ganglion neurons using the whole-cell and perforated patch configuration of voltage clamp recordings. The results indicate that the cytoplasmic dialysis that occurs during whole-cell recordings enhances the voltage dependence of calcium <b>current</b> <b>inhibition</b> and suggests that there is a greater concentration of activated G protein subunits in this configuration. While much is known about step depolarization-evoked calcium current and the kinetic changes that accompany G protein-mediated inhibition, relatively little is known about the effects of kinetic slowing on AP-evoked calcium current. Therefore, I used a modification of action potential waveforms was used to determine the effect of G protein activation on the kinetics of single action potential-evoked calcium current. The results demonstrate that kinetic slowing does not alter the time course of action potential-evoked calcium current and suggests that modulated channels may not contribute to AP-evoked calcium current...|$|E

Strong preclinical evidence supports the analgesic effects of -conopeptides, Vc 1. 1 and RgIA, which block 910 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). However, the analgesic mechanism is controversial. Some evidence supports the block of 910 nAChRs as an analgesic mechanism, while other evidence supports the inhibition of N-type CaV (CaV 2. 2) current via activation of GABAB receptors. Here, we reassess the effect of Vc 1. 1 and RgIA on CaV current in rat sensory neurons. Unlike the previous findings, we found highly variable effects among individual sensory neurons, but on average only minimal inhibition induced by Vc 1. 1, and no significant effect on the current by RgIA. We also investigated the potential involvement of GABAB receptors in the Vc 1. 1 -induced inhibition, and found no correlation between the size of CaV <b>current</b> <b>inhibition</b> induced by baclofen (GABAB agonist) versus that induced by Vc 1. 1.

The enhanced tonic inhibition of Ca(2 +) currents {{in the absence of}} agonists, indicative of constitutively active NOP receptors in transfected neurons, was abolished following pretreatment with pertussis toxin.

40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is {{a devastating}} and fatal neurodegenerative disease of adults which preferentially attacks the neuromotor system. Riluzole {{has been used}} as the only approved treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis since 1995, but its mechanism(s) of action in slowing the progression of this disease remain obscure. Searching PubMed for "riluzole" found 705 articles published between January 1996 and June 2009. A systematic review of this literature found that riluzole had a wide range of effects on factors influencing neural activity in general, and the neuromotor system in particular. These effects occurred over a large dose range (1 mM). Reported neural effects of riluzole included (in approximate ascending order of dose range) : inhibition of persistent Na+ <b>current</b> = <b>inhibition</b> of repetitive firing < potentiation of calcium-dependent K+ <b>current</b> < <b>inhibition</b> of neurotransmitter release < inhibition of fast Na+ <b>current</b> < <b>inhibition</b> of voltage-gated Ca 2 + current = promotion of neuronal survival or growth factors < inhibition of voltage-gated K+ current = modulation of two-pore K+ current = modulation of ligand-gated neurotransmitter receptors = potentiation of glutamate transporters. Only the first four of these effects commonly occurred at clinically relevant concentrations of riluzole (plasma levels of 1 - 2 mu M with three- to four-fold higher concentrations in brain tissue). Treatment of human ALS patients or transgenic rodent models of ALS with riluzole most commonly produced a modest but significant extension of lifespan. Riluzole treatment was well tolerated in humans and animals. In animals, despite in vitro evidence that riluzole may inhibit rhythmic motor behaviors, in vivo administration of riluzole produced relatively minor effects on normal respiration parameters, but inhibited hypoxia-induced gasping.

One of such is the resource-led strategy. Nigeria is superabundantly rich in crude oil and has reaped billions of petrodollars.

This paper employs the vector error-correction methodology in examining the long-run impact of the huge oil wealth accruing to Nigeria on its economic development. Indicators such as per capita GDP (PGDP), household consumption, infrastructural development (electricity), and agricultural and manufacturing output growth rates are examined. The results suggest a significant positive long-run impact of per capita oil revenue on per capita household consumption and electricity generation, while a negative relationship is established for GDP, agriculture and manufacturing. Even for those variables with negative relationship at current period, there exist positive relationships at subsequent lags. Thus, oil revenue, if properly managed and invested, could be effectively used to induce oil-led development in Nigeria provided the <b>current</b> <b>inhibitions</b> of corruption, lack of transparency, accountability and fairness in its use and distribution are removed.

The currents in both nuclei had activation and deactivation kinetics that were {{very similar to those}} of GABAB receptor-induced currents, were totally blocked by 0. 1 mM Ba 2 + and showed voltage-dependent relaxation.

In superior cervical ganglion neurons, {{we find that the}} signaling pathways underlying M <b>current</b> <b>inhibition</b> by B 2 bradykinin and M 1 muscarinic receptors respond very differently to inhibitors. The bradykinin pathway was suppressed by the phospholipase C inhibitor U- 73122, by blocking the IP 3 receptor with pentosan polysulfate or heparin, and by buffering intracellular calcium, and it was occluded by allowing IP 3 to diffuse into the cytoplasm via a patch pipette.

The addition of bradykinin was accompanied by a [Ca 2 +]i rise with a similar onset and time to peak as the inhibition of M current. The M <b>current</b> <b>inhibition</b> and the rise of [Ca 2 +]i were blocked by depletion of Ca 2 + internal stores by thapsigargin.

Voltage-gated Ca 2 + and K+ channels, the primary determinants of the influx of Ca 2 +, are regulated by GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) through G-protein-coupled intracellular signalling systems. Using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques, the changes of the Ca 2 + and K+ currents in primary cultured ovine and human somatotropes were recorded. Growth hormone-releasing hormone (10 nmol/L) increased both L- and T-type voltage-gated Ca 2 + <b>currents.</b> <b>Inhibition</b> of the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway by either Rp-cAMP or H- 89 blocked this increase in both L- and T-type Ca 2 + currents. Growth hormone-releasing hormone also decreased voltage-gated transient (I-A) and delayed rectified (I-K) K+ currents. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, such as calphostin C, chelerythrine or downregulation of PKC, blocked the effect of GHRH on K+ currents, whereas an acute activation of PKC by phorbol 12, 13 -dibutyrate (1 mu mol/L) mimicked the effect of GHRH. Intracellular dialysis of a specific PKC inhibitor (PKC 19 - 36) also prevented the reduction in K+ currents by GHRH. It is therefore concluded that GHRH increases voltage-gated Ca 2 + currents via cAMP/PKA, but decreases voltage-gated K+ currents via the PKC signalling system.

We now extend these conclusions by producing the first complete characterization of the effects of Gem, Rem, and Rem 2 on the neuronal Ca(V) 2. 1 Ca(2 +) channels expressed with Ca(V) beta(1) or Ca(V) beta(2) subunits. <b>Current</b> <b>inhibition</b> is limited to a decrease in amplitude with no modification in the voltage dependence or kinetics of the current.

Model simulations indicate that AA inhibits T-type currents by switching the channels into a nonavailable conformation and by affecting transitions between inactivated states, which results in the negative shift of the inactivation curve. Slow-inactivating α 1 G mutants showed an increased affinity for AA with respect to the wild type, indicating that the structural determinants of fast inactivation are involved in the AA–channel interaction...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{regulation}} of L-type voltage-gated Ca 2 + current {{is an important component}} of elucidating the signaling capabilities of retinal amacrine cells. Here we ask how the cytosolic Ca 2 + environment and the balance of Ca 2 +-dependent effectors shape native L-type Ca 2 + channel function in these cells. To achieve this, whole cell voltage clamp recordings were made from cultured amacrine cells under conditions that address the contribution of mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake (MCU), Ca 2 +/calmodulin (CaM) -dependent channel inactivation (CDI), protein kinase A (PKA), and Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 + release (CICR). Under control conditions, repeated activation of the L-type channels produces a progressive enhancement of the <b>current.</b> <b>Inhibition</b> of MCU causes a reduction in the Ca 2 + current amplitude that is dependent on Ca 2 + influx as well as cytosolic Ca 2 + buffering, consistent with CDI. Including the Ca 2 + buffer bis-(o-aminophenoxy) -N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) internally can shift the balance between enhancement and inhibition such that inhibition of MCU can enhance the <b>current.</b> <b>Inhibition</b> of PKA can remove the enhancing effect of BAPTA suggesting that cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation is involved. Inhibition of CaM suppresses CDI but spares the enhancement, consistent with the substantially higher sensitivity of the Ca 2 +-sensitive adenylate cyclase 1 (AC 1) to Ca 2 +/CaM. Inhibition of the ryanodine receptor reduces the current amplitude, suggesting that CICR might normally amplify the activation of AC 1 and stimulation of PKA activity. These experiments reveal that the amplitude of L-type Ca 2 + currents in retinal amacrine cells are both positively and negatively regulated by Ca 2 +-dependent mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the second}} {{synaptic}} {{layer of the}} retina, bipolar cell (BC) output to ganglion cells is regulated by inhibitory input to BC axon terminals. GABAA receptors (GABAARs) mediate rapid synaptic currents in BC terminals, whereas GABAC receptors (GABACRs) mediate slow evoked currents and a tonic current, which is strongly regulated by GAT- 1 GABA transporters. We have used voltage-clamp recordings from BC terminals in goldfish retinal slices to determine the source of GABA for activation of these <b>currents.</b> <b>Inhibition</b> of vesicular release with concanamycin A or tetanus toxin significantly inhibited GABAAR inhibitory postsynaptic currents and glutamate-evoked GABAAR and GABACR currents but did not reduce the tonic GABACR current, which was also not dependent on extracellular Ca 2 +. The tonic current was strongly potentiated by inhibition of GABA transaminase, under both normal and Ca 2 +-free conditions, and was activated by exogenous taurine; however inhibition of taurine transport had little effect. The tonic current was unaffected by GAT- 2 / 3 inhibition and was potentiated by GAT- 1 inhibition {{even in the absence}} of vesicular release, indicating that it is unlikely to be evoked by reversal of GABA transporters or by ambient GABA. In addition, GABA release does not appear to occur via hemichannels or P 2 X 7 receptors. BC terminals therefore exhibit two forms of GABACR-mediated inhibition, activated by vesicular and by nonvesicular GABA release, which are likely to have distinct functions in visual signal processing. The tonic GABACR current in BC terminals exhibits similar properties to tonic GABAAR and glutamate receptor currents in the brain...|$|R
40|$|Catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) retinal cone {{horizontal}} cells {{contain an}} L-type calcium current {{that has been}} proposed {{to be involved in}} visual processing. Here we report on the modulation of this current by activation of glutamate receptors and calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) from intracellular calcium stores. Fluorescence data obtained from isolated horizontal cells loaded with indo- 1 provided evidence of calcium release from an intracellular calcium store sensitive to caffeine, calcium and ryanodine. In the presence of caffeine, ryanodine-sensitive stores released calcium in a transient manner. Release of calcium was blocked when cells were preincubated in BAPTA, in the presence of ruthenium red, or in low concentrations of ryanodine. The release of calcium from ryanodine-sensitive stores directly corresponded with a decrease of the voltage-gated L-type calcium current amplitude. Caffeine-induced modulation of the calcium current was reduced in the presence of ruthenium red. Activation of ionotropic kainate receptors on catfish cone horizontal cells triggered CICR from ryanodine-sensitive stores and mimicked inhibition of the voltage-gated calcium <b>current.</b> Kainate-induced <b>inhibition</b> of the calcium current was diminished when intracellular calcium stores were inhibited with ruthenium red or depleted with ryanodine, or when calmodulin antagonists or CaM kinase II inhibitors were present. These results provide evidence that activation of an ionotropic glutamate receptor on catfish cone horizontal cells is linked to calcium release from ryanodine-sensitive intracellular calcium stores and modulation of the L-type calcium <b>current</b> activity. <b>Inhibition</b> of this calcium current directly or indirectly involves calmodulin and CaM kinase II and represents a possible mechanism used by horizontal cells to affect response properties of these cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{actions of}} the novel calcium (Ca 2 +) channel {{antagonist}} mibefradil (Ro 40 - 5967), a selective T-type channel blocker in myocardium, were investigated in embryonic rat spinal motoneurones maintained in culture. Whole-cell currents were recorded with the patch-clamp technique. Motoneurones displayed transient, low-voltage-activated (LVA) and, more sustained, high-voltage-activated (HVA) Ca 2 + currents. The LVA currents were small and preferentially blocked by amiloride and low doses of nickel. Most of the HVA Ca 2 + current flowed through N-type Ca 2 + channels, while L-, and P/Q-type channels represented a smaller fraction. Mibefradil caused a rapid and reversible dose-dependent block of inward Ca 2 + channel <b>currents.</b> <b>Inhibition</b> was nearly complete at 10 microM, suggesting mibefradil blockade of all subclasses of Ca 2 + channels. The IC 50 was approximately 1. 4 microM on currents measured at 0 mV, from a holding potential of - 90 mV. Inhibition of LVA Ca 2 + current occurred over the same contraction range. Slow tail currents induced by the dihydropyridine agonist Bay K 8644 were also blocked by mibefradil, although with a slightly lower potency (IC 50 = 3. 4 microM). These broad inhibitory effects of mibefradil on Ca 2 + influx were also supported by the strong inhibition of depolarization-induced intracellular calcium transients, measured from Indo- 1 loaded motoneurones imaged with confocal microscopy. We conclude that mibefradil has potent blocking effects on Ca 2 + channels in mammalian motoneurones. We hypothesize that therapeutic and pharmacological effects of mibefradil may involve actions on Ca 2 + channels other than type T. status: publishe...|$|R
