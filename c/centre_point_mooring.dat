40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of liquidity and execution probability in an exchange operated dark pool. We analyse {{a unique set of}} data collated from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) that allows the identification of trades and orders in its <b>Centre</b> <b>Point</b> dark pool. This study contributes to the understanding of factors that influence traders' preference to transact through an exchange operated dark pool and the execution probability of dark orders. We also examine the impact of <b>Centre</b> <b>Point</b> dark pool trading on market quality. The results show that the level of trading activity in the dark pool is higher for larger stocks with lower prices. Dark pool's share of total volume is higher when quoted spreads are wider, best depth is thicker, and when order imbalance, volatility and adverse selection are lower in the central limit order book. Execution probability of <b>Centre</b> <b>Point</b> orders increases when dark pool trading is most active and when average <b>Centre</b> <b>Point</b> order size is greater. We find no evidence of <b>Centre</b> <b>Point</b> trading being detrimental to market quality in our sample. 16 page(s...|$|R
