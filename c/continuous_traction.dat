The first system, called ACT-4 (active torque split) by Subaru, was the same setup commonly found on other Subaru models of the period, and used a variable clutch pack center differential using a 90/10 power split ratio front to rear, which could transfer up to a 50/50 power split ratio for maximum traction if the front wheels started to slip.

This engine was popular with Japanese buyers due to reduced tax liability based on Japanese vehicle size legislation; the car offered performance advantages over larger cars sold in Japan with bigger engines but with a smaller tax bill.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess whether}} {{mechanical}} traction, either {{alone or in}} combination with other treatments, improves pain, function/disability, patient satisfaction and global perceived effect in adults with mechanical neck disorders. Methods: We conducted a systematic review up to September 2004 of randomized controlled trials and used pre-defined levels of evidence for qualitative analysis. Two independent reviewers conducted study selection, data abstraction and methodological quality assessment. Using a random effects model, relative risk and standardized mean differences were calculated. The reasonableness of combining studies was assessed on clinical and statistical grounds. In the absence of heterogeneity, pooled effect measures were calculated. Results: Of the 10 selected trials, one study was of high quality. Our review revealed low-quality trials for mechanical neck disorders, showing evidence of benefit favouring inter-mittent traction for pain reduction. <b>Continuous</b> <b>traction</b> showed no significant difference for defined outcomes.

40|$|Closed femoral shaft {{fractures}} {{have always}} been a challenge to orthopaedic surgeons and traumatologists for many years. They account for high morbidity rates in trauma wards, prolonged hospitalization as well as affecting the productive age group of the society. In the developed world surgery is now the first option of treatment rather than conservative treatment. In the developing world however, owing to lack of both qualified personnel and funds to purchase modern implants, conservative treatment still remains the mainstay of treatment.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{effect of}} staged repair {{involving}} continuous re-lengthening of the retracted musculotendinous unit after rotator cuff tear is not known. We quantified changes in chronically retracted tendons undergoing no repair or a staged repair involving an initial re-lengthening of the musculotendinous unit by traction in a sheep model of massive rotator cuff tear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Infraspinatus tendons of 12 sheep were released {{and allowed to}} retract for 4 Â months. Repair was performed after the retracted musculotendinous unit had been progressively returned to its original length through <b>continuous</b> <b>traction</b> in 8 sheep (group I). In the other 4 sheep (group II) traction was not successful and the tendons remained retracted. Tendon structure was assessed macroscopically, by MRI, histology, and TEM. RESULTS: Normalized to their contralateral controls, at sacrifice, tendon thickness was unchanged in group I (116 %, n. s) and increased in group II (129 %, PÂ <Â  0. 05), however with substantial shortening. Increased collagen fiber crimping and disorganization was found in group II, whereas in group I the differences from normal tendon were less pronounced. CONCLUSION: Retracted musculotendinous units have deteriorated tendons, characterized by increased collagen fiber crimp, and ultrastructural collagen fibril atrophy and disorganization. <b>Continuous</b> <b>traction</b> may arrest and partially restore degenerative changes in retracted tendon. The {{findings of this study}} might contribute to new approaches for the treatment of chronic "irreparable" rotator cuff tears...|$|E

40|$|Closed {{intramedullary}} nailing, {{first reported}} byKuntscher in 1940,(1) {{is now the}} treatment of choice for most femoral shaft fractures.

The first step consists of longitudinal indirect skin traction {{for a period}} of more than 2 weeks with the hip in 20 Â° of flexion and the knee extended.

The traction is removed at least twice a day during the first two steps for skin care purposes. The third step is the reduction phase during which the weight of traction is reduced. The children remain in the hospital during the first three steps, but they are allowed home overnight or for weekends during the first and second steps depending on the treatment results. The fourth step is the spica casting to maintain the reduction, and the fifth step is the conversion of the spica cast to a Pavlik harness or abduction brace.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Long-standing {{rotator cuff}} tendon tearing is {{associated}} with retraction, loss of work capacity, irreversible fatty infiltration, and atrophy of the rotator cuff muscles. Although continuous musculotendinous relengthening can experimentally restore muscular architecture, restoration of atrophy and fatty infiltration is hitherto impossible. HYPOTHESIS: Continuous relengthening with pharmacological stimulation of muscle growth using an anabolic steroid or insulin-like growth factor (IGF) can reverse atrophy and fatty infiltration as well as improve the work capacity of chronically retracted rotator cuff muscles in sheep. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Sixteen weeks after tenotomy of the infraspinatus (ISP) tendon, atrophy and fatty infiltration had developed in the retracted ISP muscle. The musculotendinous unit was continuously relengthened in 14 sheep during 6 weeks: Four sheep were treated without pharmacological stimulation, 4 with intramuscular administration of an anabolic steroid, and 6 with IGF before final repair and rehabilitation (12 weeks). Changes were documented by intraoperative measurements of muscle work capacity, histology, and computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Musculotendinous relengthening by <b>continuous</b> <b>traction</b> resulted in gains of length ranging from 0. 7 cm in the IGF group to 1. 3 cm in the control group.

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONPrimary {{closure of}} the {{abdominal}} wall following intestinal transplantation or multivisceral transplantation could become a challenging problem in {{a significant number of}} patients. PRESENTATION OF CASEA 38 -year-old woman with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) underwent a multi-visceral transplantation for short gut syndrome. She subsequently developed acute graft rejection that proved resistant to conventional treatment. She was relisted and underwent re-transplantation along with kidney transplantation. Abdominal wall closure could not be achieved because of the large size of the graft and bowel oedema. The wound was initially managed with laparostomy followed by insertion of the delayed dynamic abdominal closure (DDAC) device (Abdominal Retraction Anchor â ABRAÂ® system). <b>Continuous</b> dynamic <b>traction</b> to the wound edges resulted in gradual approximation and complete {{closure of the}} abdominal wound was achieved within 3 weeks. DISCUSSIONSuccessful abdominal closure after multivisceral transplantation or isolated intestinal transplantation often requires biological mesh, vascularised flaps or abdominal wall transplantation. DDAC eliminated the need for a prosthetic mesh or skin graft and provided an excellent cosmetic result. Adjustment of the dynamic traction at the bedside minimised the need for multiple returns to the operating theatre. It resulted in a well-healed linear scar without a hernia.
