5000|$|At Stansted, the {{engineers}} {{who attempted to}} repair the ADI {{did not have the}} correct Fault Isolation Manual available and did not think of replacing the INU. One of them identified and repaired a damaged <b>connecting</b> <b>plug</b> on the ADI. When the ADI responded correctly to its [...] "Test" [...] button, they believed the fault had been corrected, although this button only tested the ADI and not the INU. The ADI's input selector was left in the normal position.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In the {{traditional}} teaching process of analog circuit course, the connected circuit element and current trend are not intuitive and students understand difficultly. In order {{to solve this}} problem, the teaching aid of analog circuit based on magnetic elements is researched and designed, including a DC power supply, some element modules and some connecting soft lights, {{both ends of the}} connecting soft light has a <b>connecting</b> <b>plug</b> connection, element module is comprised of bottom plate, switch, socket, input slot, output slot, symbol and permanent magnet, input slot and output slot are communicated together, switch and symbol are communicated together, permanent magnet is located {{at the bottom of the}} component module. By a plurality of component modules absorbed on the surface of iron blackboard that are marked with the symbol to make up the teaching circuit, by shining of connecting soft lights to simulate the current in the circuit, the teaching content of analog circuit is vividly demonstrated and understanding of students for teaching content is improved...|$|E

50|$|Some {{miniaturized}} {{electronic devices}} use 2.5 mm or 3.5 mm jacks as serial port connectors for data transfer and unit programming. This technique is particularly common on graphing calculators, {{such as the}} TI-83 series, and some types of amateur and two-way radio, though in some more modern equipment USB mini-B connectors are provided in addition to or instead of jack connectors. The second-generation iPod Shuffle from Apple has one TRRS jack which serves as headphone, USB, or power supply, depending on the <b>connected</b> <b>plug.</b>|$|R

25|$|Appliances with CEE7/7 (German/French) plugs {{are often}} sold in Italy, but the {{standard}} sockets will not always accept them since the pins of the CEE7/7 plugs are thicker (4.8mm) than the Italian ones (4mm). Adaptors are standardized in Italy under CEI23-57 {{which can be}} used to <b>connect</b> CEE7/7 <b>plugs</b> to linear CEI23-50 sockets.|$|R
50|$|A Toys to Life Game made by Jakks Pacific. It is a console {{connected}} to a portal <b>connected</b> to <b>plugs</b> which you <b>connect</b> to your TV. You place the figures on the portal and it goes to your game. It was short lived, there were three themes released: DC Super Heroes, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Power Rangers.|$|R
50|$|While iSCSI {{could be}} {{implemented}} {{as just a}} VLAN cluster of ports on a large multi-port switch that is also used for general network usage, the administrator may instead choose to use physically separate switches dedicated to iSCSI VLANs only, to further prevent {{the possibility of an}} incorrectly <b>connected</b> cable <b>plugged</b> into the wrong port bridging the logical barrier.|$|R

25|$|This {{style of}} connector, {{produced}} by Italian manufacturer BTicino, {{appeared in the}} 1960s and was intended {{as an alternative to}} the Europlug or CEI 23-16 connectors then in use. The socket is an almost rectangular socket, with one or more lateral key pins and indentations to prevent inverting the polarised <b>plug,</b> or <b>connecting</b> <b>plugs</b> and sockets with different current ratings. At least four models were produced: three single-phase general purpose connectors rated respectively 10 A, 16 A and 20 A; plus a three-phase industrial connector rated 10 A; all of them have different key-pin positioning so plugs and sockets cannot be mismatched. The socket is closed by a safety lid (bearing the word ‘’Magic’’ on it) which can be opened only with an even pressure on its surface, thus preventing the insertion of objects (except the plug itself) inside the socket. The contacts are blades positioned on both sides of the plug; the plug is energized only when it is inserted fully into the socket.|$|R
5000|$|One {{reason why}} banana {{connectors}} are not rated for mains usage {{is that an}} exposed banana plug or socket can present a shock hazard if connected to an energized source. A plug that is only partially inserted into a jack can also present a risk of accidental contact, because the conductive surface of the plug will not be completely covered. This can especially happen if a 20 mm long plug is inserted into a socket that is only intended for 15 mm long plugs. Further, some banana plugs have the screw used to fix the wire to the plug exposed. Also, when <b>connecting</b> <b>plugs</b> using transverse holes in the plug, {{large parts of the}} pin of the second plug are exposed. Another reason why banana connectors are not rated for mains usage is the lack of double isolation of wires and connectors. The hazards include electric shock, electrocution, burns from accidental short circuits, and damage to the attached equipment.|$|R

50|$|The CD64 sits {{underneath}} the N64 unit, {{making use of}} the EXTension port {{on the bottom of}} the console. Once <b>connected</b> and <b>plugged</b> in, a game cartridge is taken out of the N64 and one is placed into the slot on the face of the system, just {{underneath the}} N64 and just above the CD-ROM drive, to act as a kind of boot disk.|$|R
60|$|Myra had {{golden hair}} and a Greek face and would come {{bursting}} through the barber shop in a hat at least six inches wider than what they wear in Paris. As you saw her swinging up {{the street to the}} Telephone Exchange in a suit that was straight out of the Delineator and brown American boots, there was style written all over her,--the kind of thing that Mariposa recognised and did homage to. And to see her in the Exchange,--she was one of the four girls that I spoke of,--on her high stool with a steel cap on,--jabbing the <b>connecting</b> <b>plugs</b> in and out as if electricity cost nothing--well, all I mean is that you could understand why it was that the commercial travellers would stand round in the Exchange calling up all sorts of impossible villages, and waiting about so pleasant and genial!--it made one realize how naturally good-tempered men are. And then when Myra would go off duty and Miss Cleghorn, who was sallow, would come on, the commercial men would be off again like autumn leaves.|$|R

50|$|Connectors {{rated at}} 63 A and 125 A may {{optionally}} {{be equipped with}} a 6 mm pilot contact. This smaller pin in {{the centre of the}} connector is shorter than the others, designed to 'make' after all the other pins when <b>connecting</b> a <b>plug</b> and socket, and to 'break' first when disconnecting. It is used to switch off the load. This is useful as disconnecting under load will cause arcing which may cause damage to both the plug and socket, and risk injury to the user.|$|R
50|$|In 1944, the Luftwaffe {{introduced}} a plugboard switch, called the Uhr (clock), {{a small box}} containing a switch with 40 positions. It replaced the standard <b>plugs.</b> After <b>connecting</b> the <b>plugs,</b> as determined in the daily key sheet, the operator turned the switch {{into one of the}} 40 positions, each producing a different combination of plug wiring. Most of these plug connections were, unlike the default plugs, not pair-wise. In one switch position, the Uhr did not swap letters, but simply emulated the 13 stecker wires with plugs.|$|R

5|$|A plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicle (PHEV or PHV), also known as a plug-in hybrid, is a hybrid {{electric vehicle}} with rechargeable batteries that can be restored to full charge by <b>connecting</b> a <b>plug</b> to an external electric power source. A plug-in hybrid shares the characteristics of both a conventional {{hybrid electric vehicle}} and an all-electric vehicle: it uses a gasoline engine and an electric motor for propulsion, but a PHEV has a larger battery pack that can be recharged, allowing operation in all-electric mode until the battery is depleted.|$|R
50|$|An {{installation}} {{process that}} runs on a preset time or when a predefined condition transpires, {{as opposed to an}} installation process that starts explicitly on a user's command. For instance, a system administrator willing to install a later version of a computer program that is being used can schedule that installation to occur when that program is not running. An operating system may automatically install a device driver for a device that the user <b>connects.</b> (See <b>plug</b> and play.) Malware may also be installed automatically. For example, the infamous Conficker was installed when the user plugged an infected device to their computer.|$|R
