40|$|The present {{research}} examines {{the impact of}} not reauthorizing the Superfund taxes on {{the operations of the}} program. EPA NPL site status data were obtained from the EPA CERCLIS database for analysis in this study. Data were selected for the fiscal years 1981 to 2009 in four NPL listing status categories: proposal to the NPL, final NPL listing, deletion from the NPL, and achievement of construction completion. Since the Superfund tax expired in 1995, data from the 1981 to 1995 fiscal years and data from the 1996 to 2009 fiscal years were analyzed to determine if there were mean differences in NPL status achievements for those time frames potentially caused by lack of funding. The data in the fifth category (partial NPL deletion) were not analyzed because the EPA did not begin tracking this category as a program goal until 1997. EPA uses the status of sites in these categories to track achievement of program goals and effectiveness. The null hypothesis for this study {{is that there is no}} difference between program outcomes (NPL site status data reported by fiscal year) for the time period from 1981 to 1995 and 1996 to 2009 meaning that the failure to re-authorize the Superfund tax has not affected the <b>clean-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> and how they are managed. The alternative hypothesis is that failure to re-authorize the Superfund tax has affected the <b>clean-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> and how they are managed. In support of the alternative hypothesis, there were mean differences (for time frames 1981 to 1995 and 1996 to 2009) for NPL site status achievements for the following milestones: final listing on the NPL, deletion from the NPL, and achieving construction completion status on the NPL. These results suggest that variations in funding may have some impact on NPL status achievements. Annual funding trends from program inception to 2010, achievement of Superfund program goals for the 2009 and 2010 fiscal years, and the impact of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funding on the program were also examined.

40|$|<b>Clean-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> {{is usually}} {{based on a}} risk-based {{approach}} for {{the definition of the}} remediation goals, which relies on the well known ASTM-RBCA standard procedure. In this procedure, migration of contaminants is described through simple analytical models and the source contaminants’ concentration is supposed to be constant throughout the entire exposure period, i. e. 25 – 30 years. The latter assumption may often result over-protective of human health, leading to unrealistically low remediation goals. The aim of this work is to propose an alternative model taking in account the source depletion, while keeping the original simplicity and analytical form of the ASTM-RBCA approach. The results obtained by the application of this model are compared with those provided by the traditional ASTM-RBCA approach, by a model based on the source depletion algorithm of the RBCA ToolKit software and by a numerical model, allowing to assess its feasibility for inclusion in risk analysis procedures.

The use of biological methodologies for the <b>clean-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites,</b> collectively referred to as "bioremediation", has been gaining an increasing interest in recent years because it represents an effective, cost-competitive and environmentally friendly alternative to the physico-chemical and thermal treatments.

40|$|Using the hedonic pricing approach, {{this paper}} investigates how the {{information}} released on public registries of contaminated and potentially contaminated sites affects nearby {{commercial and industrial}} properties in Baltimore, Maryland.

This external cost is not cleared once the site has been cleaned up or has been pronounced to be harmless. It also found that the impacts of urban economic development policies, such as Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Zones, have had positive effects on industrial property values, but less so on commercial properties.

40|$|The use of {{cylindrical}} solid-crystal detectors for {{the detection}} and removal of gamma-emitting sources has become a common practice for the <b>clean-up</b> <b>of</b> radiological <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites.</b> It {{is often difficult to}} determine the capability of detecting a sub-surface source without performing experimental studies due to the large variation in detector types, source energy, and attenuating media. Furthermore, significant cost savings can be evident when the source is localized because time and the amount of material to be removed are reduced. 	The first part of this thesis presents a method to determine the minimal detectable limits of a sub-surface source using multiple gridded measurements. The method uses data simulated with the Los Alamos Monte Carlo N-Particle transport code (MCNPX) for detector efficiency calculations. As a necessary supplement to the process, a program was written to automate all MCNPX simulations by modifying input cards and recording the results for all required scenarios. In this work, simulated experiments were performed using Cs- 137 and Na- 22 in air and soil media to demonstrate the method. 	The second part of this thesis addresses the problem of source localization. By using a mapping of expected detector responses as a function of source location, the ratios of multiple detector measurements are fit to MCNPX simulated data. From the fit, the lateral position, depth, and activity of the source within an attenuating medium are extracted. As with {{the first part of this}} thesis, the detectors are non-collimated to maintain high detection efficiency. The method is intended to be straightforward yet effective to allow real-time localization of sources. The method is a necessary conceptual step away from triangulation since real detectors have non-isotropic efficiency and real sources are commonly attenuated. Several experiments were performed using Cs- 137 and Na- 22 in both air and soil media to verify the method. Environmental Restoration Group, Inc. Nuclear EngineeringMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

30|$|Phytoremediation {{refers to}} the use of green plants in the removal of {{environmental}} pollutants, which is recognized as a cost effective, sustainable, and environmentally friendly approach that has many advantages during the large-scale <b>clean-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> (Clemens et al. 2002; Kramer 2005; Malik 2004; Ruiz and Daniell 2009; Salt 1998). In recent studies, Meager et al. engineered bacterial mer operons such as MerA (mercuric reductase) to reduce reactive mercuric ions to volatile and relatively inert monoatomic Hg(0) vapor, and MerB (organomercurial lyase) to degrade methylmercury to mercuric ions into plants, thereby remediating methylmercury contamination (Meagher and Heaton 2005). Plants such as cottonwood trees (Lyyra et al. 2007) and tobacco (Heaton et al. 2003) have been modified to express either MerB or both MerB and MerA, which convert methylmercury to mercuric ions or mercury vapor, respectively. The disadvantage of this approach is that elemental mercury Hg(0) is released into the environment, where it accumulates and can eventually be converted into highly toxic methylmercury. To help address this environmental problem, a new methylmercury remediation method is required to replace the merA- mediated mercury reduction mechanism so plant cells can accumulate methylmercury from contaminated sites without releasing mercury vapor into the ambient air.|$|E

The white paper and supporting documentation (Appendices A and B) provide DOE with a concise and up-to-date review of potential MTCA impacts to cost and schedule for the Hanford site activities. MTCA, Chapter 70. 105 D RCW, is the State of Washington's risk based law governing <b>clean-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> and is implemented by The Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology) under the MTCA Clean-up Regulations, Chapter 173 - 340 WAC.

Most of the Hanford clean-up actions are being implemented under the CERCLA program, however, there is a trend is toward increased use of MTCA procedures and standards. The application of MTCA to the Hanford clean-up has been an evolving process with some of the Hanford clean-up actions considering MTCA standards as an ARAR and using MTCA procedures for remedy selection.

However, the application of this technology to con-taminated soil in Libya has not been fully exploited. Inthisstudy, the efficacy of different bioremediation processes (necrophytoremediation using pea straw, bioaugmentation and acombination of both treat-ments) together with natura lattenuation were assessed in dieselcontaminated Libyan soils. The addition of pea straw {{was found to be}} the best bioremediation treatment for cleaning up diesel contaminated Libyan soil after 12 weeks. The greatest TPH degradation, 96. 1 % (18, 239. 6 mgkg 1) and 95 % (17, 991. 14 mgkg 1) were obtained when the soil was amended with pea straw alone and in combination with a hydrocarbonoclastic consortium respectively. Incontrast, natural attenuation resulted in a sig-nificantly lowerTPH reduction of 76 %(14, 444. 5 mgkg 1). The presence of pea straw also led to asig-nificant increased recovery of hydrocarbon degraders; 5. 7 log CFUg 1 dry soil, compared to 4. 4 log CFU g 1 dry soil for the untreated (naturalattenuation) soil.

40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) constitute {{a group of}} priority pollutants which are of increasing environmental concern because of their adverse effects on humans, animals, and plants. Soils and sediments generally serve as a sink for PAHs, {{which leads to the}} accumulation <b>of</b> PAHs at <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites.</b> In the last decade, bioremediation has been frequently used for the <b>clean-up</b> <b>of</b> such <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites.</b> However, despite the common use and cost-effectiveness of bioremediation, it is generally observed that a residual fraction remains undegraded even when optimal biodegradation conditions have been provided. In many cases the recalcitrance of this residual fraction is caused by a limited bioavailability of PAHs. The present thesis focuses on the development of simple and rapid laboratory methods for the prediction of PAH bioavailability. As an integrated part of this study, it was aimed to expand the current knowledge on the structure of amorphous and condensed soil/sediment organic matter (SOM) domains. It is believed that PAHs sorbed in amorphous domains are readily bioavailable, while PAHs sorbed in condensed domains are poorly bioavailable. Three different methods were investigated for the prediction of PAH bioavailability: persulfate oxidation, cyclodextrin extraction, and surfactant extraction. Persulfate oxidation appeared to be a good and rapid method for the prediction of PAH bioavailability. It was demonstrated that a 3 hour oxidation at 70 o C was sufficient for the removal of all bioavailable PAHs. The oxidation method was successfully validated in a study with 14 historically contaminated soil and sediment samples. Cyclodextrin extraction and surfactant extraction were investigated in a study with two sediment samples, using hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin and Triton X- 100 (surfactant) as model compounds. It was demonstrated that hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin extracted primarily readily bioavailable PAHs, while Triton X- 100 extracted both readily and poorly bioavailable PAHs. Moreover, hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin did not affect the biodegradation of PAHs, while Triton X- 100 enhanced the degradation of low molecular weight PAHs. Altogether, it may be concluded that persulfate oxidation currently provides the most rapid validated method for the prediction of PAH bioavailability in soils and sediments. To study the composition of amorphous and condensed SOM domains, two different approaches were followed: (i) samples were subjected to persulfate oxidation to remove amorphous SOM, before and after which the composition of SOM was studied by thermogravimetric analysis, pyrolysis-GC/MS, and CPMAS 13 C-NMR; (ii) samples were split in two parts, one part was bioremediated to remove bioavailable PAHs, and both the bioremediated and non-bioremediated part were subjected to 9 different chemical treatments with a known effect on SOM structure. Before and after chemical treatment PAH concentrations and PAH bioavailability were measured. The two approaches led to the following general conclusions on the structure of amorphous and condensed SOM domains: (1) Condensed SOM is less polar than amorphous SOM. (2) Labile components like carbohydrates, peptides, fatty acids, and free alkanes are likely {{to be associated with the}} amorphous SOM domain. (3) There is no clear relationship between aromaticity and the degree of SOM condensation. (4) Condensed SOM is situated in the humin fraction, indicating that it has a relatively high C content, a relatively low O content, and a relatively high degree of polymerization. (5) Humic and fulvic acids are primarily associated with amorphous SOM. (6) Coal and soot are specific condensed facies with a high affinity for PAHs. Apart from these general characteristics it appeared that the composition of the SOM domains was highly sample specific...|$|R

The main barrier in the chemical degradation of organohalides {{is the presence of}} the halogen group in the molecule, which also contributes to the toxic nature of these compounds. However, a remarkable group of microorganisms, the halorespiring bacteria, are able to reductively dehalogenate organohalides under anaerobic conditions and use the energy generated via a proton gradient pump for bacterial growth (halorespiration). Due to their versatile dehalogenating capacity, halorespiring bacteria have a large potential in the <b>clean-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> (bioremediation). The work described in this thesis aimed to gain knowledge on two aspects of the molecular basis of halorespiration: (i) the reaction mechanism of dehalogenation, catalyzed by the B 12 /iron-sulphur containing reductive dehalogenases, and (ii) the regulatory mechanism which enables transcriptional activation of genes involved in halorespiration. As model organisms, two Desulfitobacterium spp. were chosen, capable of ortho and/or meta dechlorination of chlorophenols and hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls. Unravelling of the novel reaction mechanism of reductive dehalogenases was so far hampered by difficulties in functional overproduction of these enzymes. We developed a protocol which involves co-expression of molecular chaperons to aid functional synthesis of the metalloenzymes in Escherichia coli. Next, multiple potential transcriptional activators were characterised from D. hafniense by promoter fusions and in vitro DNA-binding assays. We found that CprK 1 and CprK 2 activated transcription in the presence of an ortho -chlorophenol (CHPA) but not with its dechlorinated derivative (HPA), while meta -chlorophenols proved to be effectors for CprK 4. All CprK paralogues recognized a conserved motif (dehalobox) in halorespiration-inducible promoters. Site-directed mutagenesis of CprK 1 provided further insight on the role of conserved residues in the DNA-recognition a -helix and on redox regulation of the protein. Crystal structures of the CHPA-bound CprK 1 and the effector-free form of the closely related CprK of D. dehalogenans revealed a possible mechanism by which the regulators distinguish between CHPA and the non-effector HPA ("pK a interrogation" theory). Native mass spectrometry of protein-DNA complexes confirmed these results and - together with limited proteolysis experiments - also contributed to the fundamental knowledge of ligand-induced changes in the conformation and dynamics of CprK-related transcriptional regulations...|$|E

It focused on the Department of Trade and Investment, Regional Infrastructure and Services (DTIRIS), which is the largest landholder by area and extensively involved in the management of a range <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites.</b> This detailed examination was supplemented by a survey of over 30 large landholding government agencies in New South Wales and their management arrangements for dealing with <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites.</b> This audit draws upon the December 2013 Auditor-General’s Report to Parliament and previous reports that raised concerns regarding the management <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites...</b>|$|R

40|$|A lot of {{powerful}} test {{systems for the}} ecotoxicological characterization <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> have been developed in recent years. Some of them are standardized, some {{are in the process}} of standardization right now. Although the degree of standardization of the test systems has been improved, there is still a great variety in the fields of sample preparation and sample storage on the one hand and in the field of interpretation of test results on the one hand. Due to these circumstances it can be recommended that the methodic aspects should be documented in detail in order to ensure comparability of test results. There should be a strong emphasis on quality assessment and quality control. Despite of this lack of standardization ecotoxicological test systems can already be successfully applied before, during, and after remediation <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites.</b> The obtained results provide important information on the biological and ecotoxicological status of the soil, and they should be considered during every process of soil remediation. For the implementation of the ecotoxicological characterisation <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> into the legally binding assessment <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> the following aspects seem to be of great importance for future research: (1) standardization of soil sampling, transport, sample preparation, sample storage, and test procedures; (2) selection of test systems with respect to soil functions; (3) harmonized definition of assessment criteria. By the application of these test systems a path-specific assessment <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> considering the intended future land use is possible. It provides important additional information which is complementary to the information derived from chemical analyses...|$|R
40|$|<b>Clean-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> soils is {{a costly}} and slow process that {{requires}} {{long periods of}} time to be effective. Therefore, direct use <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> with appropriate management is often likely to be a more efficient use of such land. Consequently, the production of safe animal forages from contaminated soils was the aim of this research. Field studies were conducted to evaluate the growth and elemental composition of river saltbush (Atriplex amnicola) grown on a metal-contaminated soil. The soil was amended with compost at rates of 0, 15 and 30 t/ha to assess its role on plant growth and metal uptake. Compost application significantly (P < 0. 05) increased biomass yield, crude protein (CP) and ash content of river saltbush; in contrast, it decreased the Zn and Pb concentrations in shoot tissues. When 30 t/ha of compost was added, the Pb concentrations in the stems and leaves decreased by 32 and 38 %, respectively. Despite the large total and extractable content of metals in the studied soil, shoot concentrations of these metals in A. amnicola were always maintained below potentially toxic levels. The biomass material of A. amnicola had a high nutritive value compared to conventional forage crops and could safely be used as animal forage. This work demonstrates that an Atriplex spp, A. amnicola, has significant potential for use as a safe forage crop in the sustainable on-site management <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> soil...|$|R
