5|$|After Smith's {{teammate}} Jack Clark hit a late-inning {{home run}} {{of his own}} in Game 6 to defeat the Dodgers, the Cardinals moved on to face the Kansas City Royals in the 1985 World Series. Once again sportswriters were quick {{to draw attention to}} Smith's outstanding defensive play instead of his 2 for 23 effort at the plate. After the Cardinals took a three-games-to-two advantage, a controversial Game 6 <b>call</b> <b>by</b> umpire Don Denkinger overshadowed the remainder of the Series (which the Royals won in seven games).|$|E

At {{the time of}} his appointment, Haiti was in {{political}} turmoil: former president, Jean-Bertrande Aristide, was locked in a battle to retake power in the election of 2000. Upon arrival in Haiti, Carney laid out U.S. concerns—lack of governance, lack of economic sustainability programs and an inability to prevent narco-trafficking through Haiti as the first port of <b>call</b> <b>by</b> the Cali drug cartels from Colombia.|$|E

5|$|Earned runs are runs {{that are}} {{directly}} attributable to a pitcher's efforts without a lapse by the defense. An unearned run does not adversely impact a pitcher's {{earned run average}} (ERA), and is only possible when an error (including catcher's interference) or a passed ball occurs earlier in the inning. Unearned runs are primarily discussed in rule 10.16 and often require a judgment <b>call</b> <b>by</b> the official scorer.|$|E

5|$|Ibrahim Pasha {{continued}} his expedition against the rebels of Jabal Nablus, pursuing them at Zeita. Ninety rebels were slain {{while the rest}} fled to Deir al-Ghusun, situated on a hilltop {{to the east of}} Zeita. At Deir al-Ghusun, many of the inhabitants and rebels heeded a <b>call</b> <b>by</b> Husayn Abd al-Hadi to flee once the Egyptian troops arrived. In response, Qasim had several of the defectors among his ranks killed. Ibrahim Pasha's troops stormed the hill and the rebels (mostly members of the Qasim, Jarrar, Jayyusi and Barqawi clans) were routed, suffering 300 fatalities. Most of the surviving rebels, including Qasim and his son Yusuf, who were both wounded, fled. Captured rebels of fighting age were sent to Egypt for professional military training, while older rebels had their right hands cut off.|$|E

Burke scored 24 points {{in the championship game}} and made the seven-man All-Tournament team (which was revised multiple times) along with teammates McGary and Albrecht. The turning point of the game was described as a missed <b>call</b> <b>by</b> the referees when, as Michigan trailed 67–64 with 5 minutes left, Burke pinned Peyton Siva's dunk attempt with a clean, all-ball block, but was called for a foul, resulting in two made free throws by Siva. Michigan never got closer than 4 points the rest of the game.|$|E

The Constellation program was funded and construction and testing begun on a staffed spacecraft and launch vehicle, and design studies for a lunar base. However, that program has been cancelled in favor of a staffed asteroid landing by 2025 and a staffed Mars orbit by 2035. India has also expressed its hope to send a staffed mission to the Moon by 2020.|$|E
5|$|Harriman Station, {{formerly}} known as Turner Station until 1910, was the first station on the Erie Railroad Main Line west of Newburgh Junction tower in Harriman, New York. Built {{on the side of}} Grove Street in Harriman, the station depot was constructed originally as Turner Station in 1838, as a three story hotel-train station combination. This station caught fire in 1873 and was replaced by a one-story wooden structure. That structure survived as long as its predecessor before it began decaying and was replaced in 1911 with a new station on land donated by the widow of Edward Henry Harriman. A new one-story structure was built on the land. The station was maintained as a one-story depot with a large monument to the side dedicated to the work of Charles Minot. Minot was a director of the Erie Railroad who, in 1851, while his train was stopped at Turner, made the first railroad <b>call</b> <b>by</b> telegraph.|$|E
5|$|In March 2005 Sihanouk accused Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam of {{encroaching}} into Cambodian territory, through unilateral border demarcation exercises without Cambodian participation. Two months later, Sihanouk {{formed the}} Supreme National Council on Border Affairs (SNCBA), which he headed, {{to address these}} concerns. While the SRP and Chea Sim expressed support for Sihanouk {{for the formation of}} the SNCBA, Hun Sen decided to form a separate body, National Authority on Border Affairs (NABA), to deal with border concerns, with SNCBA to serve only as an advisory body. After Hun Sen signed a border treaty with Vietnam in October 2005, Sihanouk dissolved the SNCBA. In August 2007 the Cambodian Action Committee for Justice and Equity, a US-based human rights NGO, called for Sihanouk's State immunity to be lifted, so as to allow him to testify in the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC). Sihanouk responded to the <b>call</b> <b>by</b> inviting the ECCC public affairs officer, Peter Foster, for a discussion session on his personal experience under the Khmer Rouge regime. Both Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC criticized the suggestion, with the latter accusing the NGO of being disrespectful. The ECCC subsequently rejected Sihanouk's invitation.|$|E

5|$|The magpie is {{generally}} sedentary and territorial throughout its range, living in groups occupying a territory, or in flocks or fringe groups. A group may occupy {{and defend the}} same territory for many years. Much energy is spent defending a territory from intruders, particularly other magpies, and different behaviours are seen with different opponents. The sight of a raptor results in a rallying <b>call</b> <b>by</b> sentinel birds and subsequent coordinated mobbing of the intruder. Magpies place themselves {{either side of the}} bird of prey so that it will be attacked from behind should it strike a defender, and harass and drive the raptor to some distance beyond the territory. A group will use carolling as a signal to advertise ownership and warn off other magpies. In the negotiating display, the one or two dominant magpies parade along the border of the defended territory {{while the rest of the}} group stand back a little and look on. The leaders may fluff their feathers or caroll repeatedly. In a group strength display, employed if both the opposing and defending groups are of roughly equal numbers, all magpies will fly and form a row at the border of the territory. The defending group may also resort to an aerial display where the dominant magpies, or sometimes the whole group, swoop and dive while calling to warn an intruding magpie's group.|$|E
25|$|Most purely {{functional}} programming languages (notably Miranda and its descendents, including Haskell), and the proof languages of theorem provers, use lazy evaluation, {{which is essentially}} the same as <b>call</b> <b>by</b> need.

In the example given above, (λx.xx) ((λx.x)y) reduces to ((λx.x)y) ((λx.x)y), which has two redexes, but in <b>call</b> <b>by</b> need they are represented using the same object rather than copied, so when one is reduced the other is too.|$|E
