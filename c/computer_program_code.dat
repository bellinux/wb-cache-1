5000|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} relevance of White-Smith, however, {{is that it}} foreshadowed {{the debate over whether}} object code (<b>computer</b> <b>program</b> <b>code</b> in the form of 0s and 1s encoded in a magnetic tape or disc or in an EPROM) was protected by US copyright law. In the early 1980s the issue was in considerable doubt, and initially several lower court decisions held that object code was not a [...] "copy" [...] of a computer program. Two court of appeals decisions involving copying of Apple computers and their software were influential in reversing the tide. They upheld the protectability of object code embodiments of computer programs and rejected the supposed requirement that a candidate for status as a work of authorship must communicate a message to human readers or perceivers. These decisions wrote the human-intelligibility requirement of White-Smith out of copyright law, as a qualification for investiture of copyright, although the [...] "piano-roll amendment" [...] had only established that human-intelligibility was not a requirement for an infringing [...] "copy." [...] In principle, what infringes could be broader than what gives rise to copyright, on the theory that works of authorship need a hedge or moat around them to assure adequate protection.

Detection methods based on the information retrieval concepts of indexing and similarity matching scale well to large collections of files, but require appropriate similarity functions for good performance. We have used particle swarm optimization and genetic programming to evolve similarity functions that are suited to <b>computer</b> <b>program</b> <b>code.</b> Using a training set of plagiarised and non-plagiarised programs we have evolved better parameter values for the previously published Okapi BM 25 similarity function. We have then used genetic programming to evolve completely new similarity functions that do not conform to any predetermined structure. We found that the evolved similarity functions outperformed the human developed Okapi BM 25 function. We also found that a detection system using the evolved functions was more accurate than the the best code plagiarism detection system in use today, and scales much better to large collections of files.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to propose an algorithm for the determination of the allowable ampacities of single rectangular-section bus bars without the occurrence of correction factors.

Natural and forced convection correlations for rectangular bus bars are applied.

The finite element method (FEM) has been used for the linear/non-linear steady-state thermal analysis, i. e. for validation of the analytical algorithm.

The essence of this project is to enunciate a proactive solution to any catastrophic breakdown a marine diesel engine may suffer as a result of environmental factors and vibration.

A four stroke caterpillar 3516 B series marine diesel engine with 16 -VTS marine diesel engine was used to actualize the work.
