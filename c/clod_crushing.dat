40|$|<b>Clod</b> <b>crushing</b> is a {{principal}} problem with soils of high clay content. Therefore, {{there is a need}} for determining the conditions for clod breaking and <b>clod</b> <b>crushing.</b> The objective of the work was to develop a special purpose tool for single clod breaking both by rigid support of the clod and by a single clod supported by soil and to develop a machine for <b>clod</b> <b>crushing.</b> Furthermore, the purpose was to determine the relationship between the specific energy requirement for <b>clod</b> <b>crushing</b> in the function of soil plasticity and the soil moisture content by the means of the developed tool and machine. The main result of the experiments is summarized in a 3 D diagram where the specific energy requirement for soil <b>clod</b> <b>crushing</b> is given in the function of the moisture content and the plasticity index for different clay soils...|$|E
