40|$|Introduction. Tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) is a conglomerated mass of pelvic organs {{including}} tube, ovary, and bowel. The {{most commonly}} isolated organisms from TOAs are Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Bacteroides species. Case Report. We reported {{a case of}} <b>Clostridium</b> <b>septicum</b> (C. <b>septicum)</b> <b>infection</b> from a ruptured TOA with atypical clinical features. Culture of intra-abdominal free fluid obtained during surgery yielded C. septicum. VITEK II (bioMérieux, France) automated system was used for advanced identification of the bacteria. Parenteral clindamycin in combination with an aminoglycoside was used. The patient was discharged 19 days after the surgery and was clinically asymptomatic 6 months after the surgery. Conclusion. The differential diagnosis of TOA caused by C. septicum can be difficult, {{due to the lack}} of the symptoms. Tissues infected with C. septicum can become necrotic. A combination of early, adequate antibiotic therapy and surgery is the key point of the treatment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAfter {{emergency}} repair of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm {{associated with an}} aortocaval fistula, <b>Clostridium</b> <b>septicum</b> sepsis prompted evaluation for colon cancer. Adenocarcinoma of the right colon ultimately required hemicolectomy, after which the patient had development of recurrent C. septicum bacteremia. Computed tomography scanning demonstrated a large fluid collection surrounding the aortic graft, and percutaneous drainage documented recurrent C. septicum. Initial axillobifemoral bypass was followed by removal of the patient's aortic graft and retroperitoneal drainage. After 3 years the patient is without evidence of recurrent infection or tumor. This case report consists of a known instance of C. <b>septicum</b> <b>infection</b> of an aortic graft. (J VASC SURG 1995; 22 : 493 - 5. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{association}} {{exists between}} colon carcinoma and <b>Clostridium</b> <b>septicum</b> <b>infection,</b> especially bacteremia. We reviewed retrospectively all positive blood cultures for this organism at a 300 -bed general hospital over 4 years. Four of 15 cases {{were associated with}} concurrent colon carcinoma. C. septicum infection was the presenting feature of previously undiagnosed large bowel malignancy in three patients. We report this small case series to alert clinicians to the diverse spectrum and diagnostic difficulties of this rare, potentially catastrophic association. Although commonly associated with necrotizing skin or soft tissue infections, this bacterium can present with nonspecific or atypical symptoms.

40|$|The use of {{allograft}} {{tissue in}} orthopaedic surgery has increased tremendously {{over the last}} several years. Tissue availability, reduced surgical times, and lack of donor site morbidity are attractive characteristics to surgeons and patients alike.

40|$|Evidence mounts {{favoring the}} relationship, albeit unexplained, between <b>Clostridium</b> <b>septicum</b> <b>infection</b> and malignancy, {{particularly}} hematologic or intestinal malignancy. Seven patients with C. septicum gangrene or sepsis {{have been treated}} at the Massachusetts General Hospital in the years 1977 - 79. All of these patients have had associated malignant disease: four patients had colon adenocarcinomas, two patients had acute myeloblastic leukemias, and one patient had breast carcinoma. In six of the seven patients, the malignancy was in an advanced state; the breast carcinoma showed no evidence of recurrence after mastectomy, 17 years earlier. A bowel portal of entry is postulated in five patients. Despite prompt use of appropriate antibiotics, the only survivors {{were two of the}} four patients who underwent early extensive debridement. These results suggest that, in the patient with C. septicum infection, malignancy should be sought; that, in the septic patient with known malignancy, C. septicum should be considered; and that, in the absence of external source in the patient with clostridial myonecrosis or sepsis, the cecum or distal ileum should be considered a likely site of infection. Increased awareness of this association between C. septicum and malignancy, and aggressive surgical treatment, may result in improvement in the present 50 - 70 % mortality rate...|$|E

40|$|A fatal {{complication}} {{of colon cancer}} A 90 -year-old female was admitted with a probable adverse re-action to codeine phosphate after a 10 -day history of lethargy, abdominal pain and increased colostomy output. A recent staging CT thorax/abdomen/pelvis showed a recurrence of a previous colon cancer with lung metastasis. She was pyrexial, but initial clinical examination was unremarkable. Sixteen hours later, she deteriorated and developed subcutaneous em-physema of her left chest wall with signs of disseminated intra-vascular coagulation (Figure 1). A presumptive diagnosis of septic shock was made and intravenous antibiotics were admi-nistered, but the patient passed away several hours later. Penicillin-sensitive <b>Clostridium</b> <b>septicum</b> was grown from an anaerobic blood culture bottle within 24 h of admission. <b>Infections</b> with C. <b>septicum</b> have an overwhelming association with colorectal cancer and often not suspected {{in the early stages}} [1].

40|$|The Clostridia {{species are}} {{responsible}} {{for some of the}} deadliest diseases including gas gangrene, tetanus, and botulism. <b>Clostridium</b> <b>septicum</b> is a rare subgroup known to cause atraumatic myonecrosis and is associated with colonic malignancy or immunosuppression. It is a Gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming bacillus found in the gastrointestinal tract and can lead to direct, spontaneous infections of the bowel and peritoneal cavity. The anaerobic glycolysis of the tumor produces an acidic, hypoxic environment favoring germination of clostridial spores. Tumor-induced mucosal ulceration allows for translocation of sporulated bacteria from the bowel into the bloodstream, leading to fulminant sepsis. C. septicum bacteremia can have a variable presentation and is associated with greater than 60 % mortality rate. The majority of deaths occur within the first 24 hours if diagnosis and appropriate treatment measures are not promptly started.

The aim {{of this study was to}} isolate the alpha toxin of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>septicum</b> and produce highly specific antibodies against it. In this work, we have developed a simple and efficient method for alpha toxin purification, based on electroelution that can be used as a time-saving method for purifying proteins. This technique avoids contamination by other proteins that could appear during other protein purification techniques such chromatography. The highly purified toxin was used to produce polyclonal antibodies. The specificity of the antibodies was tested by western blot and these antibodies can be applied to the quantitative determination of alpha toxin by slot blot...|$|R

Emergency thoracoabdominal exploration revealed a necrotizing infection of the thoracic aorta extending to the origin of the celiac axis. After surgery <b>Clostridium</b> <b>septicum</b> was identified in tissue culture. Surgical management consisted of in-situ graft replacement of the thoracoabdominal aorta. Three months later, a pseudoaneurysm developed at the distal anastomosis. The patient refused further surgery and died 3 days later.
