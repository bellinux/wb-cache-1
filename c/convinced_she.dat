5|$|At the {{appointed}} hour, Duchess appears at Ribby's {{door and the}} party begins. Distracted for a moment, Duchess does not see which oven Ribby opens to remove the pie. Duchess eats greedily, believing she is eating her ham and veal pie.

She sets up a howl; Ribby is perplexed and annoyed but leaves to find Dr. Maggoty, a magpie.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Henry Townshend has been locked in his apartment in South Ashfield for five days with no means of communication and having recurring nightmares. Shortly afterwards, a hole appears in the wall of his bathroom, through which he enters alternate dimensions. His first destination is an abandoned subway station, where he meets Cynthia Velázquez, a woman <b>convinced</b> <b>she</b> is dreaming and who is soon killed by an unknown man. Awakening in his apartment, he hears confirmation on his radio that she is indeed dead in the real world. Similar events repeat with the next three people Henry finds: Jasper Gein; Andrew DeSalvo, a former employee of an orphanage run by Silent Hill's cult; and Richard Braintree, a resident in Henry's apartment complex. All the deaths bear similarities to the deceased serial killer Walter Sullivan's modus operandi.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, Anderson was {{institutionalized}} in {{a mental}} hospital after a suicide attempt in Berlin. At first, she went by the name Fräulein Unbekannt (German for Miss Unknown) as she refused to reveal her identity. Later she used the name Tschaikovsky and then Anderson. In March 1922, claims that Anderson was a Russian grand duchess first received public attention. Most members of Grand Duchess Anastasia's family {{and those who had}} known her, including court tutor Pierre Gilliard, said Anderson was an impostor but others were <b>convinced</b> <b>she</b> was Anastasia. In 1927, a private investigation funded by the Tsarina's brother, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse, identified Anderson as Franziska Schanzkowska, a Polish factory worker with a history of mental illness. After a lawsuit lasting many years, the German courts ruled that Anderson had failed to prove she was Anastasia, but through media coverage, her claim gained notoriety.|$|E
5|$|Leslie is <b>convinced</b> <b>she</b> can {{reason with}} Andy {{if they can}} talk without their lawyers, but Andy will not return her calls. Finally, Ann calls Andy and asks {{him to come to}} her house. Later that day, he arrives {{completely}} naked, having assumed Ann wanted to take him back. A disgusted Ann leaves the house, leaving Leslie and Andy to talk. Andy admits he is suing the town in an attempt to win Ann back, and she thinks of a different way he can impress her. The next day at city hall, Andy tells Leslie and Scott he will drop the lawsuit if they agree to fill in the pit right away. Scott agrees, unaware it was a trick between Andy and Leslie. The next day the pit is filled in and turned into a lot, and an impressed Ann waves at Andy while the construction work is going on. The episode ends with Keef riding a motorboat, revealing his role in KaBOOM! was an elaborate prank to get the playground built, and announcing he is going to build a hospital in a poor part of China.|$|E

There they find a rival, Marot’s competitor Warren Foltz, who is fanatically attached to a rival theory and is not averse to destroying contrary evidence. Moreover, Foltz is being assisted by xenologist Alicia Dyckman, to whom Fergus had formerly been wed in a stormy marriage culminating in divorce. The cause was Alicia’s contentious and overbearing personality; <b>convinced</b> <b>she</b> always knew best, she had interfered with Fergus’s tours to the point that he had finally barred her from participating.|$|E

Although decades past her prime and mostly forgotten by the public, Norma is <b>convinced</b> <b>she</b> is as beautiful and in demand as ever. Max perpetuates this illusion by shielding {{her from the}} realities of life out of the limelight and by writing her letters purportedly from still-devoted fans. Norma informs Joe of her plan {{to return to the}} screen with Salome, a script she has written for Cecil B. DeMille to direct with her in the starring role as the teenage biblical temptress. Dubious but sensing opportunity, Joe accepts her offer of work as editor on the script. Norma insists that Joe stay in her home while they collaborate on Salome.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} part, Price {{is forced to}} be {{inactive}} again, to see if Crawford is worthy of her or not; at the same time, Price knows she can best serve the Bertrams by refusing to marry Crawford despite their pressure on her to give in. When Price does become active again when she loses interest in her needlework to allow her eyes to be locked with Crawford’s, she nearly loses Edmund who is <b>convinced</b> <b>she</b> does not love him. When Crawford comes to court Price at Portsmouth, despite being impressed {{to a certain extent}} by him, by remaining inactive, she demands of Crawford more perseverance and moral commitment than he is capable of, which causes the superficial Crawford to soon lose interest in her. And in this way, Price marries Edmund and upholds the values which she cherishes.|$|E
25|$|When Michel was sixteen, she {{experienced}} a seizure and {{was diagnosed with}} psychosis caused by temporal lobe epilepsy. She soon had depression and was treated at a psychiatric hospital. By {{the time she was}} twenty, she had become intolerant of various religious objects, and began to hear voices. Her condition worsened despite medication, and she became suicidal. <b>Convinced</b> <b>she</b> was possessed, her family appealed to a Catholic priest for an exorcism. While rejected at first, after much hesitation, two priests got permission from the local bishop in 1975. After her death, Michel's parents and the two priests were found guilty of negligent homicide, and were sentenced to six months in jail (reduced to three years of probation), and a fine. The Catholic church changed its position stating she was mentally ill, not possessed. The case has been cited {{as an example of a}} misidentified mental disorder, negligence, abuse and religious hysteria.|$|E

500|$|It was now common {{knowledge}} that Edward was dying. The Imperial ambassador, Jehan de Scheyfye, had been convinced for years that Dudley was engaged in some [...] "mighty plot" [...] to settle the Crown on his own head. As late as 12 June, though, he still knew nothing specific, despite having inside information about Edward's sickness. France, which found {{the prospect of the}} Emperor's cousin on the English throne disagreeable, gave indications of support to Northumberland. Since the Duke did not rule out an armed intervention from Charles V, he came back on the French offer after the King's death, sending a secret and non-committal mission to King Henry II. After Jane's accession in July the ambassadors of both powers were <b>convinced</b> <b>she</b> would prevail, although they were in no doubt that the common people backed Mary. Antoine de Noailles wrote of Guildford Dudley as [...] "the new King", while the Emperor instructed his envoys to arrange themselves with the Duke and to discourage Mary from undertaking anything dangerous.|$|E
500|$|Later at the funeral, Salt {{appears to}} succeed in killing President Matveyev, and then surrenders herself. Matveyev is {{declared}} dead. Salt escapes again and heads to a barge where Orlov is hiding with other sleeper agents. In a series of flashbacks, Salt recalls {{growing up in the}} Soviet Union and being trained with other children. On the barge, Orlov welcomes her back and has Mike killed in front of her. [...] When Salt shows no reaction, Orlov is <b>convinced</b> <b>she</b> is loyal and begins briefing her on her next mission. She is to rendezvous with another KA who will help her assassinate the American president. She kills Orlov and the other agents before leaving. She then meets with KA Shnaider (Corey Stoll), who uses his cover as a NATO liaison to get Salt into the White House. Once inside, Shnaider launches a suicide attack to force agents to move the President (Hunt Block) to an underground bunker, accompanied by Winter. Salt follows them and manages to enter the bunker before it is sealed.|$|E
500|$|Sotomayor {{had wanted}} to become a judge since she was in {{elementary}} school, and in 1991 she was recommended for a spot by Democratic New York senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Moynihan had an unusual bipartisan arrangement with his fellow New York senator, Republican Al D'Amato, whereby he would get to choose roughly {{one out of every four}} New York district court seats even though a Republican was in the White House. Moynihan also wanted to fulfill a public promise he had made to get a Hispanic judge appointed for New York. When Moynihan's staff recommended her to him, they said [...] "Have we got a judge for you!" [...] Moynihan identified with her socio-economic and academic background and became <b>convinced</b> <b>she</b> would become the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice. D'Amato became an enthusiastic backer of Sotomayor, who was seen as politically centrist at the time. Of the impending drop in salary from private practice, Sotomayor said: [...] "I've never wanted to get adjusted to my income because I knew I wanted to go back to public service. And in comparison to what my mother earns and how I was raised, it's not modest at all." ...|$|E

Though he {{is widely}} {{believed}} to be gay, he admits to Wray that he is pretending {{so that he can}} attract older politically conservative women through the [...] "corrosive black lie" [...] that sexuality is a choice.

500|$|Eve Myles, {{who played}} Gwyneth, was {{initially}} {{not supposed to}} film the episode as she was booked for another role in theatre. However, her agent notified Myles of the role and Myles' was keen to audition for the series due to its reputation and Eccleston being [...] "one of my favourite actors of all time". After inadvertently attending the audition in a T-shirt emblazoned with an image of two naked women kissing under the slogan [...] "I support Nudist Colonies", Myles was <b>convinced</b> <b>she</b> had not got the part; her appearance contrasted grossly with Gwyneth's personality. After being notified of her success Myles {{did not want to}} prioritise between her theatre commitments and Doctor Who; her agent decided that she would appear in the episode. Russell T Davies was enamoured by her performance, which he felt confirmed that the actress was [...] "one of Wales's best-kept secrets", and subsequently wrote her a lead role in the Doctor Who spin-off Torchwood. Myles' Torchwood character Gwen Cooper is intimated to be related to Gwyneth in [...] "Journey's End" [...] after the Doctor asks Gwen about her family history. Alan David was cast as Mr Sneed; Gatiss was pleased with the casting, as he had grown up watching David.|$|E
500|$|Mercedes (Amber Riley), {{supported}} by her boyfriend Shane (LaMarcus Tinker), auditions {{for the role}} of Maria and impresses the directors—Emma, Coach Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) and Artie (Kevin McHale)—with her rendition of [...] "Spotlight". They schedule a callback between her and Rachel (Lea Michele) to help them decide who should be cast in the role. Mercedes is angry about what she perceives as continued favoritism shown to Rachel, especially in the awarding of solos, and when Will pushes her in the glee club's extra dance rehearsals that Rachel is excused from, she decides she has had enough and quits glee club. When Mercedes and Rachel compete by singing [...] "Out Here On My Own" [...] in the callbacks, Mercedes gives a performance that Rachel privately concedes was better, which prompts Rachel to begin a last-minute candidacy for senior class president to improve her college prospects; this dismays Kurt, who now has another rival to campaign against. The three directors decide to offer the role of Maria to both contenders, with each to do half the performances, but Mercedes is <b>convinced</b> <b>she</b> deserved to win the part outright and refuses to accept half a role. She withdraws from contention, which leaves Rachel as the sole Maria, and volunteers to join Shelby Corcoran's (Idina Menzel) new glee club. The cast list is posted, with Rachel as Maria, Blaine as Tony, Santana as Anita, Mike as Riff, and Kurt as Officer Krupke.|$|E
500|$|Ryan McCaffrey of Official Xbox Magazine {{thought that}} the game {{resolved}} {{some of the problems}} of open world design and thus allowed for an experience with good times and no filler, such as Burnout-style arrows on the streets instead of hidden in the minimap GPS. He added that this was the game Volition [...] "was born to make". Grimm from GamesRadar similarly praised Volition for their [...] "http://deckers.die" [...] mission, which was [...] "so insanely creative and funny that it single handedly makes the game worth playing". He added that the game's unrealistic driving made the game more fun. IGN's Hatfield was [...] "really won ... over" [...] by his character and both was <b>convinced</b> <b>she</b> cared about her friends and impressed by her voice actress. Whitehead of Eurogamer found Zimos, the pimp who speaks in Autotune, to be the game's best character. Edge found some of the writing [...] "sharp" [...] and executed well by the voice actors. PC Gamer Tom Senior found the major story missions to be a highlight. Hatfield of IGN thought the single-player game fell apart at the end and called the two endings either [...] "a super downer" [...] or nonsense. He found the cooperative mode easy to set up, but felt like the game's missions were not designed well for multiple players, and that the visiting player became a [...] "third wheel". On the other hand, CBS News's Christina Santiago called the cooperative mode [...] "near perfect" [...] and exemplary.|$|E

500|$|Mutchnick, {{in regards}} of Debra Messing's character, said: [...] "Grace doesn't fall {{into any of}} those {{categories}} that have stereotyped Jewish women. She's strong, she's pretty and she's a proud Jewish woman." [...] Mutchnick revealed that Nicollette Sheridan was originally brought in to read the part of Grace, but even though she did a [...] "great job", her performance was [...] "too desperate". Mutchnick and Kohan decided to cast Messing in the role instead, {{who at the time}} was starring in ABC's drama Prey. After her first meeting with them, Messing was not <b>convinced</b> <b>she</b> wanted the role. Messing revealed that Mutchnick and Kohan showed up at her home with a bottle of vodka; [...] "They poured me several shots, we spoke for several hours and they pitched me the show. I'm a lightweight. I didn't need much to be a little giddy. By the end of the evening, they said, 'Will you do it?' I said, 'Let's talk tomorrow.'" [...] They called her the next day to inform her that they [...] "loved her" [...] and asked [...] "if she'd made up her mind". Messing still did not make her mind up. However, the following day, she called Mutchnick and Kohan and accepted the role. In discussion of the character, Messing said: [...] "I have a lot more confidence and I'm much more relaxed. I feel comfortable that Grace will be a character I'll enjoy doing for a long time." [...] She later, however, admitted that director Burrows was the reason for doing Will & Grace. Messing was the last actor to be cast.|$|E
500|$|... "Weight Gain 4000" [...] {{introduced}} several {{characters who}} would maintain important recurring roles {{throughout the rest}} of the series. Among them were Jimbo Kern, Mayor McDaniels, and Wendy's best friend Bebe Stevens. It also introduces Clyde Donovan, a student from Mr. Garrison's class who would eventually play significant roles in future seasons, although he was not identified by name. The characters demonstrate the wide range of often-extreme personalities among the adult residents of South Park, as well as serving as individual satires. McDaniels, who imagines herself an instant star upon being seen on television with Gifford, is portrayed as more caring about her own fame than the needs of her constituents, and the neglect with which Jimbo sells a gun to an obviously unstable Mr. Garrison serves as a satire of gun control. Jimbo and his friend Ned (who was not introduced until [...] "Volcano") were inspired by caricatures Parker used to draw during high school. In creating McDaniels, Parker and Stone envisioned a sophisticated mayor who was <b>convinced</b> <b>she</b> was better than the other residents of South Park. The episode also marked the first reference to Jesus and Pals, the public-access television talk show hosted by Jesus Christ. The fictional show is mentioned twice in the background during commercials on television sets, although footage from the show itself is not shown until [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride" [...] later in the season. Jesus and Pals, and the idea of Jesus as a South Park resident, are references to the original The Spirit of Christmas cartoon. Debbie Liebling, who served as a South Park producer at the time of the episode's broadcast, said the inclusion of a television show hosted by Jesus helped convey for audiences the idea of South Park as a place where [...] "anything can happen".|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Lorrainers," [...] as the occupying {{forces were}} dubbed, were popularly loathed. The Viceroy, the Prince de Craon, whom the Electress disliked for his [...] "vulgar" [...] court, allowed the Electress to live {{undisturbed}} {{in her own}} wing of the Pitti, living in virtual seclusion, only on occasion receiving a select-number of guests under a black dais in her silver-clad audience room. She occupied herself financing and overseeing {{the construction of the}} Cappella dei Principi—started in 1604 by Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany—to the tune of 1,000 crowns per week, and she donated much of her fortune to charity: £4,000 per annum. [...] This is equivalent to £ in present-day terms. On 18 February 1743, Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici, Dowager Electress Palatine, died of an [...] "oppression on the breast". Sir Horace Mann, 1st Baronet, a British resident in Florence, recalled in a letter that [...] "The common people are <b>convinced</b> <b>she</b> went off in a hurricane of wind; a most violent one began this morning and lasted for about two hours, and now the sun shines as bright as ever..." [...] The royal line of the House of Medici became extinct with her death. Her will, having been completed just months before, according to Sir Horace Mann, left £500,000 worth of jewellery to the Grand Duke Francis and her lands in the former Duchy of Urbino to the Marquis Rinuccini, her main executor and a minister under her father, Cosimo III. She was interred in the crypt that she helped to complete in San Lorenzo; although not entirely finished {{at the time of her}} death, her testament stipulated that part of the revenue of her estate should [...] "be used to continue, finish and perfect...the said famous chapel San Lorenzo".|$|E
