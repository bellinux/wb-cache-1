40|$|Invasive {{alien species}} {{are a threat}} to {{protected}} areas, species, and habitats worldwide. At the European level, the control of invasive alien species is a major goal of the EU Biodiversity Strategy, and a cornerstone, in this sense, is the Regulation (EU) no. 1143 / 2014 on invasive alien species. In this study, {{we focus on the}} Alpine and <b>Continental</b> <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> of Europe (defined in art. 1 of the Habitats Directive; 92 / 43 /EEC), and aim to give an overview of the main protected forest habitat types threatened by invasive alien species, and focus on five major invasive alien tree species (Acer negundo, Ailanthus altissima, Prunus serotina, Quercus rubra, and Robinia pseudoacacia). We considered the assessment reports under Article 17 of the Habitats Directive for the period 2007 â€“ 2012, and six documents on the interpretation of habitats, to identify those most threatened by invasive alien species and in particular by the five invasive alien trees. We also assessed selected examples of impacts by these alien tree species on different species groups within Natura 2000 sites to highlight potential effects on biodiversity. Riparian forest habitats and oak dominated woodlands are among the most prone to invasion within the two <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions.</b> A. altissima and R. pseudoacacia are the most reported invasive alien trees in these protected forest habitat types. Furthermore, examples of the impacts of these tree species have indicated potential detrimental effects on forest habitats structure and functions, and on single species listed in the Habitats and Birds Directives. In conclusion, we emphasise the need for effective management and systematic monitoring of these five invasive alien tree species within Natura 2000 sites...|$|R
40|$|Tree {{species with}} wide {{distributions}} often exhibit {{different levels of}} genetic structuring correlated to their environment. However, understanding how environmental heterogeneity influences genetic variation is difficult because the effects of gene flow, drift and selection are confounded. We investigated the genetic variation and its ecological correlates in a wind-pollinated Mediterranean tree species, Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl, within a recognised glacial refugium in Croatia. We sampled 11 populations from environmentally divergent habitats within the <b>Continental</b> and Mediterranean <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions.</b> We combined genetic data analyses based on nuclear microsatellite loci, multivariate statistics on environmental data and ecological niche modelling (ENM). We identified a geographic structure with a high genetic diversity and low differentiation in the Continental region, which contrasted with the significantly lower genetic diversity and higher population divergence in the Mediterranean region. The positive and significant correlation between environmental and genetic distances after controlling for geographic distance suggests an important influence of ecological divergence of the sites in shaping genetic variation. The ENM provided support for niche differentiation between the populations from the Continental and Mediterranean regions, suggesting that contemporary populations may represent two divergent ecotypes. Ecotype differentiation was also supported by multivariate environmental and genetic distance analyses. Our results suggest that despite extensive gene flow in continental areas, long-term stability of heterogeneous environments have likely promoted genetic divergence of ashes in this region and can explain the present-day genetic variation patterns of these ancient populations...|$|R

This study compares the effects of biogeography and ecology to determine the plant diversity of European forests using a representative sample of 3100 plots all over Europe (BIOSOIL project). The general aim is to compare the effects of ecology and management with respect to biogeography. Total plant diversity was divided into different spatial components: plot, site, forest type (a proxy for ecological factors) and <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region.</b> Three hypotheses were tested: H 1 : The diversity accounted by the <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region</b> is higher that the diversity accounted by the lower scale components; H 2 : Beta nestedness is higher within than across <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions,</b> while Beta complementarity is lower within than across <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> (after correction for extent). H 3 : Distance decay rate across <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> is higher than distance decay rate within <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> (after correction for extent).

40|$|Background: Italian forests {{contains}} a high total diversity of plants species {{and this is}} likely due to the huge biogeographical gradients covered by the country (from the Alps to the Mediterranean) {{as well as to}} the long lasting human exploitation and management practices. This study aims to investigate the interactive effects of ecology and biogeography in determining the total plant diversity of Italian forests using a spatially representative sample of forests made of 201 plots sampled all over the country (CONECOFOR LI network). The general hypothesis to be tested is that the effects of present day ecological factors are less important than biogeographical factors in determining the total diversity of forested areas. The plant diversity of the sampled forest plan communities was divided into different spatial components, in particular: plot, site, forest type (used as a proxy for present day ecological conditions) and <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region.</b> Species presence absence was only used. The three following hypotheses have then been tested: Hypothesis 1 : The diversity component accounted by the <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region</b> is higher that the diversity accounted by the lower scale components (plot, site, forest type). Hypothesis 2 : Distance decay rate across <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> is higher than distance decay rate within <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> (after correction for extent). Hypothesis 3 : Beta nestedness is higher within than across <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> (after correction for extent); on the other hand Beta complementarity is lower within than across <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> (after correction for extent).

40|$|<b>Biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> (geographically {{distinct}} assemblages {{of species}} and communities) consti-tute a cornerstone for ecology, biogeography, evolution and conservation biology. Species turnover measures {{are often used}} to quantify biodiversity patterns, but algorithms based on similarity and clustering are highly sensitive to common biases and intricacies of species distribution data. Here we apply a community detection approach from network theory that incorporates complex, higher order presence-absence patterns. We demonstrate {{the performance of the}} method by applying it to all amphibian species in the world (c. 6, 100 species), all vascular plant species of the USA (c. 17, 600), and a hypothetical dataset containing a zone of biotic transition.

40|$|Aim: Climbing plants (lianas, vines, scramblers) are {{under-represented}} in many global datasets that underpin {{knowledge in}} functional trait biology, important for ecological theory, conservation and predicting forest dynamics under global change. To address this omission, we tested {{a set of}} hypotheses about how the traits of climbers vary with latitude and climate and amongst major <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> of the world using a comprehensive new, global dataset. Location: Global. Methods: Data on seed mass, leaf size, specific leaf area, climbing mechanism, dispersal mode, and growth habit were compiled for 1092 species in 34 countries. For each trait we: (1) quantified the strength of latitudinal gradients using analyses across species and across evolutionary divergences, (2) examined underlying relationships between trait variation and climate variables, (3) tested for phylogenetic signal in traits (the tendency for closely related species to exhibit similar traits), and (4) compared trait variation and phylogenetic clustering between four major <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> of the world (Africa, the Americas, Asia and Australasia). Results: We found highly significant relationships between latitude and four traits (growth habit, leaf size, seed mass and specific leaf area, SLA). Leaf size, seed mass and SLA also showed significant relationships with mean annual temperature and precipitation. However, no relationship was found between dispersal mode and latitude or between climbing mechanism and latitude. These results were largely consistent in cross-species and phylogenetic analyses. All traits, except seed mass, exhibited clear differences between <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions.</b> SLA and seed mass {{were the only two}} traits that did not present a significant phylogenetic signal. Phylogenetic clustering was detected in species from the Americas and Africa, indicating that trait conservatism is important in broad <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions.</b> Main conclusions: The functional traits and phylogenetic patterns of climbers differ between <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions,</b> and from other better-studied plant growth forms. Species-level trait differences may hold the key to understanding why climbers are increasing in abundance in some regions of the world, but not in others. 15 page(s...|$|R
