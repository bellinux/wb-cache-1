40|$|Background Little {{is known}} about child {{disability}} and dynamic aspects of poverty. Method Analysis of data collected over a 12 -month period for families (a) supporting a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> intellectual disability (n = 370), (b) supporting a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> other disability (n = 1, 418), and (c) supporting a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> no disability (n = 7, 215). Results When compared to families not supporting a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> disability, families supporting a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> intellectual disability were (a) {{more likely to be}} poor, (b) more likely to become poor, (c) less likely to escape from being poor. Half of poverty transitions were associated with identifiable potential trigger events. Conclusions There were few differences between families supporting or not supporting a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> disability with regard to either levels of exposure to potential trigger events or to the strength of the association between exposure and poverty transitions...|$|R
5|$|Certain {{disorders}} occur {{more often}} in people with epilepsy, depending partly on the epilepsy syndrome present. These include depression, anxiety, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and migraine. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder affects {{three to five times}} more <b>children</b> <b>with</b> epilepsy than children without the condition. ADHD and epilepsy have significant consequences on a child's behavioral, learning, and social development. Epilepsy is also more common in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> autism.|$|E
5|$|<b>Children</b> <b>with</b> high-functioning autism {{suffer from}} more intense and {{frequent}} loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that <b>children</b> <b>with</b> autism {{prefer to be}} alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may {{affect the quality of}} life more deeply.|$|E

Hierarchical regression analyses revealed support for the hypothesis that couples who have a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> an ASD who score lower on measures of negative attributions of negative events within their marriage, lower on blaming their <b>child</b> <b>with</b> an ASD for negative events within their marriage, and higher on perceived spousal support will score higher on marital satisfaction.
