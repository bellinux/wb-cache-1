50|$|For President Johnson, {{favorable}} {{changes in}} the O/B numbers for the Viet Cong, such as {{reduction in the number}} of their main force, would directly indicate the war's progress. American combat forces were introduced in 1964. Their numbers were steadily augmented until reaching over half a million troops. Military doctrines generally had required a ten to one advantage to defeat a guerrilla 'people's army'. Yet because American technology provided better mobility (e.g., helicopters) and increased firepower in weaponry, a mere three to one ratio was thought sufficient.

50|$|The linear {{component}} is active when the tissue pressure exceeds ambient pressure by a given amount {{specific to the}} tissue compartment. When the tissue pressure drops below this cross-over criterion the tissue is modelled by exponential kinetics. During gas uptake tissue pressure never exceeds ambient, so it is always modelled by exponential kinetics. This results in a model with the desired asymmetrical characteristics of slower washout than uptake. The linear/exponential transition is smooth.

40|$|Additional {{storage of}} water is a {{potential}} option to meet future water supply goals. Financial comparisons are needed to improve decision making about whether to store water in surface reservoirs or below ground, using managed aquifer recharge (MAR). In some places, the results of cost-benefit analysis show that MAR is financially superior to surface storage. However, uncertainty often exists as to whether MAR systems will remain operationally effective and profitable in the future, because the profitability of MAR is dependent on many uncertain technical and financial variables. This paper introduces a method to assess the financial feasibility of MAR under uncertainty. We assess such uncertainties by identification of <b>cross-over</b> <b>points</b> in break-even analysis. <b>Cross-over</b> <b>points</b> are the thresholds where MAR and surface storage have equal financial returns. Such thresholds {{can be interpreted as}} a set of minimum requirements beyond which an investment in MAR may no longer be worthwhile. Checking that these thresholds are satisfied can improve confidence in decision making. Our suggested approach {{can also be used to}} identify areas that may not be suitable for MAR, thereby avoiding expensive hydrogeological and geophysical investigations...|$|R
50|$|Hybrid {{automatic}} repeat request (hybrid ARQ or HARQ) is {{a combination}} of high-rate forward error-correcting coding and ARQ error-control. In standard ARQ, redundant bits are added to data to be transmitted using an error-detecting (ED) code such as a cyclic redundancy check (CRC). Receivers detecting a corrupted message will request a new message from the sender. In Hybrid ARQ, the original data is encoded with a forward error correction (FEC) code, and the parity bits are either immediately sent along with the message or only transmitted upon request when a receiver detects an erroneous message. The ED code may be omitted when a code is used that can perform both forward error correction (FEC) in addition to error detection, such as a Reed-Solomon code. The FEC code is chosen to correct an expected subset of all errors that may occur, while the ARQ method is used as a fall-back to correct errors that are uncorrectable using only the redundancy sent in the initial transmission. As a result, hybrid ARQ performs better than ordinary ARQ in poor signal conditions, but in its simplest form this comes at the expense of significantly lower throughput in good signal conditions. There is typically a signal quality <b>cross-over</b> <b>point</b> below which simple hybrid ARQ is better, and above which basic ARQ is better.|$|E

40|$|Significant {{differences}} are observed between the CD spectra of eu- and heterochromatin prepared by fractionating mechanically sheared rat liver chromatin on linear sucrose density gradients. Heterochromatin has a broad positive CD at 270 [...] 280 nm, a <b>cross-over</b> <b>point</b> at 256 nmn, and a negative shoulder at 248 nm. Euchromatin displays {{a shift in}} the positive peak to 267 nm and the <b>cross-over</b> <b>point</b> to 254 nm, as well as an intensification of the 267 nm peak. The negative shoulder at 248 nm is absent in euchromatin. These spectral differences between eu- and heterochromatin are present in both low and high ionic strength media. Mechanical shearing does not induce CD alteration and anomalous light scattering is absent in our system. The greater RNA content of euchromatin compared to heterochromatin cannot account for the spectral differences. These results suggest that the DNA conformation of euchromatin is distinct from that of heterochromatin and they may provide clues to the reasons for the greater transcription of euchromatin...|$|E

The concept of the connexome is then translated into the understanding of the mechanisms leading to two inherited arrhythmia diseases: arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, and Brugada syndrome.

40|$|Abstract. The {{extraction}} of gravity anomalies from airborne strapdown INS gravimetry has been mainly based on state-space approach (SSA), which has many advantages but displays a serious disadvantage, namely, its very limited capacity to handle space correlations (like the rigorous treatment of <b>cross-over</b> <b>points).</b> This paper examines an alternative through the well known geodetic approach, where the INS differential mechanization equations are {{interpreted as a}} least-squares network parameter estimation problem. The authors believe that the above approach has some potential advantages that are worth exploring.

40|$|The "fast" {{polynomial}} multiplication algorithms for dense univariate polynomials {{are those}} which are asymptotically faster than the classical 0 (N²) method. These "fast" algorithms suffer from a common defect {{that the size of}} the problem at which they start to be better than the classical method is quite large; so large, in fact that it is impractical to use them in an algebraic manipulation system. A number of techniques are discussed here for improving these fast algorithms. The combination of the best of these improvements results in a Hybrid Mixed Basis FFT multiplication algorithm which has a <b>cross-over</b> <b>point</b> at degree 25 and is generally faster than a basic FFT algorithm, while retaining the desirable O(N log N) timing function of an FFT approach. The application of these methods to multi-variate polynomials is also discussed. The use is advocated of the Kronecker Trick to speed up a fast algorithm. This results in a method which has a <b>cross-over</b> <b>point</b> at degree 5 for bivariate polynomials.

40|$|Rectangular nozzles are {{increasingly}} used for modern military aircraft propulsion installations, including the roll nozzles on the F- 35 B vertical/short take-off and landing strike fighter. A peculiar {{phenomenon known as}} axis-switching is generally observed in such non-axisymmetric nozzle flows during which the jet spreads faster along the minor axis compared to the major axis. This might affect the under-wing stores and aircraft structure. A computational fluid dynamics study was performed to understand the effects of changing the upstream nozzle geometry on a rectangular free jet. A method is proposed, involving the formulation of an equation based upon a statistical model for a rectangular nozzle with an exit aspect ratio (ARe) of 4; the variables under consideration (for a constant nozzle pressure ratio (NPR)) being inlet aspect ratio (ARi) and length of the contraction section. The jet development was characterised using two parameters: location of the <b>cross-over</b> <b>point</b> (Xc) and {{the difference in the}} jet half-velocity widths along the major and minor axes (ΔB 30).

40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented of wave-vector dispersion in elliptically birefringent stratified magneto-optic media having one-dimensional periodicity. It is found that local normal-mode polarization-state differences between adjacent layers lead to mode coupling and impact the wave-vector dispersion {{and the character}} of the Bloch states of the system. This coupling produces extra terms in the dispersion relation not present in uniform circularly birefringent magneto-optic stratified media. Normal mode coupling lifts the degeneracy at frequency band <b>cross-over</b> <b>points</b> under certain conditions and induces a magnetization-dependent optical band gap. This study examines the conditions for band gap formation in the system.
