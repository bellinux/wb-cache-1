The varieties of capitalism approach suggests that competitive and coordinated business systems are oriented toward success in different types of industries. The development of an appropriate framework for the <b>comparative</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> small business policy can be guided to some extent by current approaches to the <b>comparative</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> industrial policy. This approach to the <b>comparative</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> industrial policy is useful for distinguishing between different industrial policy instruments but does not {{go so far as}} providing a basis for the <b>comparative</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> industrial policy regimes. An emphasis on market relations also involves general deregulatory measures designed to achieve greater market flexibility and improve the business environment for SMEs including tax reform, reform of administrative requirements, and labor market reform. Government-imposed administrative burdens are seen as a significant cost for small firms and are therefore regarded as an impediment to small business entrepreneurship and innovation...|$|R
