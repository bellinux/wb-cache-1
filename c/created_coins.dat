5000|$|Professor Richard Guyatt (1914-2007) was a British {{designer}} and academic {{who has been}} described as [...] "one of the 20th century's most seminal figures in the world of graphic design". He was the youngest ever professor at the Royal College of Art on appointment in 1948, and was Rector of the Royal College of Art from 1978-81. He worked for the Royal College of Art for 34 years, and also acted as consultant designer to Wedgwood, WH Smith and other British companies.

50|$|Tracing the coinage from 44 BC {{through the}} {{developing}} rule of Augustus reveals the changing relationship of Julius Caesar to the Sidus Iulium. Robert Gurval {{notes that the}} shifting status of Caesar’s comet in the coinage follows a definite pattern. Representations of the deified Julius Caesar as a star appeared relatively quickly, occurring within several years of his death. About twenty years passed, however, before the star completed its transformation into a comet. Starting in 44 BC, a money maker named P. Sepullius Macer <b>created</b> <b>coins</b> with the front displaying Julius Caesar crowned with a wreath and a star behind his head. On the back, Venus, the patron goddess of the Julian family, holds a starred scepter. Gurval maintains that this coin was minted {{about the time of}} Caesar’s assassination and thus probably would not have originally referred to his deification. As it circulated, however, it would have brought that idea to mind because of Caesar’s new cult. Kenneth Scott’s older work The Sidus Iulium and the Apotheosis of Caesar contests this by assuming that the comet did indeed spark this series because of similarity to other coins he produced. A series of Roman aurei and denarii minted after this cult began show Mark Antony and a star, which most likely represents his position as Caesar’s priest. In later coins likely originating near the end of Octavian’s war with Sextus Pompey, the star supplants Caesar’s name and face entirely, clearly representing his divinity.|$|E

50|$|This {{particular}} plating process uses a {{steel core}} that is electro-magnetically plated {{with a thin}} layer of nickel, then a layer of copper and finally another layer of nickel. As a smaller quantity of copper and nickel is required, this process has reduced circulation coin production costs. The composition of plated coins is more durable, thereby reducing the number of damaged coins in circulation and increasing their overall efficiency. By varying the thicknesses of the alternating layers of nickel and copper, the Mint can also <b>create</b> <b>coins</b> with unique electromagnetic signatures, preventing fraud and producing the most secure circulation coins on the market.|$|R

50|$|The vast {{majority}} of medieval coins were cold struck; the planchets were not heated. While medieval coin dies were largely made of iron, some dies have been discovered with a small region at {{the face of the}} die which is made of steel. As technology and the economy changed {{over the course of the}} Middle Ages, so did the techniques used to <b>create</b> <b>coin</b> dies. While most ancient coin dies used engraving very heavily, early medieval coinage was dominated by dies created mostly from punches, which displace the metal of the die instead of removing it. There is evidence of medieval die cutters using engraving tools to lay out designs, and to create detailed punches. However, engraving on the face of the die did not become commonplace until the early Renaissance.|$|R
5000|$|A die {{break is}} caused when the mint die suffers a crack and this crack feature is {{transposed}} onto the coins in the minting process.

[...] A die break can <b>create</b> <b>coins</b> that have deep impressions in a coin that is filled in with metal. The coin shows a raised patch of metal were the brake occurred. This type of error is commonly known as a [...] "cud" [...] error.
