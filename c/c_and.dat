40|$|Abstract Thlaspi caerulescens (Ganges ecotype) {{is able to}} {{accumulate}} large concentrations of cadmium (<b>Cd)</b> <b>and</b> zinc (Zn) in the leaves without showing any toxicity, suggesting a strong internal detoxification. The distri-bution of <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn in the leaves was investigated in the present study. Although the <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn concentrations in the epidermal tissues were 2 -fold {{higher than those of}} mesophyll tissues, 65 – 70 % of total leaf <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn were distributed in the mesophyll tissues, suggesting that mesophyll is a major storage site of the two metals in the leaves. To examine the subcellular localisation of <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn in mesophyll tissues, protoplasts and vacuoles were isolated from plants exposed to 50 lM <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn hydroponically. Pure protoplasts and vacuoles were obtained based on light-microscopic observation and the activities of marker enzymes of cytosol and vacuoles. Of the total <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn in the mesophyll tissues, 91 % and 77 %, respectively, were present in the protoplast, <b>and</b> all <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> 91 % Zn in the protoplast were localised in the vacuoles. Furthermore, about 70 % and 86 % of total <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn, respectively, in the leaves were extracted in the cell sap, suggesting that most <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn in the leaves is present in soluble form. These results indicate that internal detoxification of <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn in Thlaspi cae-rulescens leaves is achieved by vacuolar compartmen-talisation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this work, the uptake and whole-body {{accumulation}} of <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn by the common carp from water, diet, and {{a combination of}} both was studied using the radioactive tracers 109 <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> 65 Zn. A three-compartment pharmacokinetic model was constructed and revealed metal- and exposure routedependent accumulation profiles. Under the tested exposure conditions in water (0. 1 ìM <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> 1 ìM Zn), only 0. 1 and 0. 07 %, respectively, of the total <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn load that passed the branchial surfaces was accumulated by the carp. In contrast, the carp accumulated 20 and 29 % of the total ingested <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn load (mean concentrations in food of newly accumulated metals were 2. 24 ± 0. 29 and 19. 91 ± 2. 89 nmol/g wet weight, respectively). However, the contribution of the waterborne metals to the whole-body metal accumulation was higher than the metal uptake from food. The constructed model was used to simulate the effect of variable assimilation efficiency (AE) values on the relative importance of dietary <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn exposure to the overall metal accumulation in common carp. This simulation was performed under a realistic exposure scenario <b>and</b> with <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn AE values ranging from 5 to 95 %. Dissolved Zn levels were higher <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> levels lower compared to the laboratory experiments. Levels in the midge larvae were much higher. The results show that under these conditions, even at the lowest <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn AEs, almost 40 % of the total body <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn concentrations originated from dietary <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn exposure. Taking into account the <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn AE of the laboratory experiments, respectively, 31 and 55 %, more than 85 % of the total body <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn was taken up from the food...|$|R

5|$|In 1901 English and Welsh breeders {{established}} a breeders' association, the Welsh Pony and Cob Society, {{and the first}} stud book was published in 1902. It was decided that the Welsh Stud Book should be separated into sections divided by type and height. Welsh Ponies were originally only classified as Section A, but in 1931, with the rising demand for riding ponies for children, Section B was added. In the first stud books, the Section B was the Welsh Pony of Cob Type, and the Welsh Cob was Section <b>C</b> <b>and</b> Section D. The upper height limit for Section D Cobs was removed in 1907 and in 1931 Sections <b>C</b> <b>and</b> D were combined as simply Section C. The current standards of Cobs as Sections <b>C</b> <b>and</b> D were finalised in 1949.

Cadmium (<b>Cd)</b> <b>and</b> Zn concentration in the fourtreatments were administered in the following order: root > leaf > stem, and obvious differences were noted among thetreatments and clones. The leaf Cd concentration of clone BH 2 <b>and</b> stem <b>Cd</b> concentration of clone BH 5 in the combinedCd and Zn treatment group was increased by 62 % and 110 %, respectively, relative of that of the Cd alone treatmentgroup. On the other hand, the leaf and stem Zn concentration of clone BH 8 in the combined <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn treatment groupwas reduced by 66 % and 61 %, respectively, relative to that of the Zn alone treatment group. Translocation of <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Znfrom the root was higher in the leaf than in the stem, <b>and</b> the combined <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn treatment stimulated the translocationof Cd from the root to the leaf and stem, whereas it suppressed the translocation of Zn from the root to the leaf andstem. Therefore, the interaction effects were considered strongly synergistic with Cd in the presence of Zn, but provedantagonistic to Zn in the presence of Cd in the combined <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn treatment group. The phytoremediation potentialsof the seven clones, which were estimated from standard indices of <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn concentration in <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn alone andthe combined <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn treatment groups, were highest in clone BH 3, and lowest in clone BH 5. Therefore, we recognizeS. caprea as an appropriate material for phytoremediation, and this is particularly the case with clone BH 3. However,further research will be required to evaluate the effects of <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn on the physiological changes as well as tolerancemechanisms against metal toxicity in S. caprea clones...|$|R
