40|$|BACKGROUND: RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) is {{an effective}} tool to examine the function of individual genes. Carboxylesterases (CarE, EC 3. 1. 1. 1) are known to play significant roles in the metabolism of xenobiotic compounds in many insect species. Previous studies in our laboratory found that CarE expression was up-regulated in Aphis gossypii (Glover) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) adults of both omethoate and malathion resistant strains, indicating the potential involvement of CarE in organophosphorus (OP) insecticide resistance. Functional analysis (RNAi) is therefore warranted to investigate the role of CarE in A. gossypii to OPs resistance. RESULT: CarE expression in omethoate resistant individuals of Aphis gossypii was dramatically suppressed following ingestion of dsRNA-CarE. The highest knockdown efficiency (33 %) was observed at 72 h after feeding when dsRNA-CarE concentration was 100 ng/µL. The CarE activities from the CarE knockdown aphids {{were consistent with the}} correspondingly significant reduction in CarE expression. The CarE activity in the individuals of control aphids was <b>concentrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> of 650 - 900 mOD/per/min, while in the individuals of dsRNA-CarE-fed aphids, the CarE activity was <b>concentrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> of 500 - 800 mOD/per/min. In vitro inhibition experiments also demonstrated that total CarE activity in the CarE knockdown aphids decreased significantly as compared to control aphids. Bioassay results of aphids fed dsRNA-CarE indicated that suppression of CarE expression increased susceptibility to omethoate in individuals of the resistant aphid strains. CONCLUSION: The results of this study not only suggest that ingestion of dsRNA through artificial diet could be exploited for functional genomic studies in cotton aphids, but also indicate that CarE can be considered as a major target of organophosphorus insecticide (OPs) resistance in A. gossypii. Further, our results suggest that the CarE would be a propitious target for OPs resistant aphid control, and insect-resistant transgenic plants may be obtained through plant RNAi-mediated silencing of insect CarE expression...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Protein {{structure}} plays {{a pivotal}} role in elucidating mechanisms of parasite functioning and drug resistance. Moreover, protein structure aids the determination of protein function, which can together with the structure be used to identify novel drug targets in the parasite. However, various structural features in Plasmodium falciparum proteins complicate the experimental determination of protein structures. Limited similarity to proteins in the Protein Data Bank and the shortage of solved protein structures in the malaria parasite necessitate genome-scale structural annotation of P. falciparum proteins. Additionally, the annotation of a range of structural features facilitates the identification of suitable targets for experimental and computational studies. Methods An integrated structural annotation system was developed and applied to P. falciparum, Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium yoelii. The annotation included searches for sequence similarity, patterns and domains in addition to the following predictions: secondary structure, transmembrane helices, protein disorder, low complexity, coiled-coils and small molecule interactions. Subsequently, candidate proteins for further structural studies were identified based on the annotated structural features. Results The annotation results are accessible through a web interface, enabling users to select groups of proteins which fulfil multiple criteria pertaining to structural and functional features 1. Analysis of features in the P. falciparum proteome showed that protein-interacting proteins contained a higher percentage of predicted disordered residues than non-interacting proteins. Proteins interacting with 10 or more proteins have a disordered content <b>concentrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> of 60 – 100 %, while the disorder distribution for proteins having only one interacting partner, was more evenly spread.

40|$|AbstractUnderstanding {{bacterial}} {{transportation in}} unsaturated soil is helpful for reducing and avoiding pathogenic contamination {{that may be}} induced by irrigation with reclaimed waste water and for developing better irrigation management practices. Experiments were conducted to study the transport of a typical bacterium, Escherichia coli (E. coli), in a sandy and a sandy loam soil under different application rates and input concentrations. A 30 ° wedge-shaped plexiglass container was used to represent one twelfth of the complete cylinder in the experiments. The apparent cylindrical application rate varied from 1. 05 to 5. 76 L h− 1 and the input concentration of E. coli from magnitude of 102 to 107 colony-forming unit (CFU) mL− 1. For a given volume of water applied, an increase in application rate resulted {{in an increase in}} the wetted radius and a decrease in the wetted depth. In the sandy loam soil, the water spread out in a circular-arc shaped saturated zone on the surface, and the ultimate saturated entry radius increased with the application rate. An increasing application rate of water suspended bacteria allowed a more rapid transport of bacteria, thus accelerating E. coli transport rate and resulting in a larger distributed volume of E. coli for both soil types. For the sandy soil, more than 70 % of the E. coli that was detected within the entire wetted volume <b>concentrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> of 10 cm from the point source, and the concentration of E. coli decreased greatly as the distance from the point source increased. More than 98 % of the E. coli was detected in a range of 5 cm around the saturated wetted zone for the sandy loam soil. For both soil types tested, an extremely high concentration of E. coli was observed in the proximity of the point source, and the peak value increased with an increased input concentration. In principle, using an emitter with relative lower application rate would be effective to restrict E. coli transport. To reduce bacterial concentration in the sewage effluent during wastewater treatment is important to decrease the risk of soil contamination caused by irrigation with sewage effluent...|$|E

40|$|Using {{adaptive}} mesh-refinement cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with {{a physically}} motivated supernova feedback prescription {{we show that}} the standard cold dark matter model can account for extant observed properties of damped Lyman alpha systems (DLAs). We then examine the properties of DLA host galaxies. We find: (1) While DLA hosts roughly trace the overall population of galaxies at all redshifts, they are always gas rich. (2) The history of DLA evolution reflects primarily {{the evolution of the}} underlying cosmic density, galaxy size and galaxy interactions. With higher density and more interactions at high redshift DLAs are larger in both absolute terms and in relative terms with respect to virial radii of halos. (3) The variety of DLAs at high redshift is richer with a large contribution coming from galactic filaments, created through close galaxy interactions. The portion of gaseous disks of galaxies where most stars reside makes relatively small contribution to DLA incidence at z= 3 - 4. (4) The vast majority of DLAs arise in halos of mass M_h= 10 ^ 10 - 10 ^ 12 Msun at z= 1. 6 - 4. At z= 3 - 4, 20 - 30 % of DLA hosts are Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). (5) Galactic winds play an indispensable role in shaping the kinematic properties of DLAs. Specifically, the high velocity width DLAs are a mixture of those arising in high mass, high velocity dispersion halos and those arising in smaller mass systems where cold gas clouds are entrained to high velocities by galactic winds. (6) In agreement with observations, we see a weak but noticeable evolution in DLA metallicity. The metallicity distribution centers at [Z/H]=- 1. 5 to - 1 at z= 3 - 4, with the peak moving to [Z/H]=- 0. 75 at z= 1. 6 and [Z/H]=- 0. 5 by z= 0.

30|$|Imaging {{observations}} of the A 5 V star β Pictoris have revealed its circumstellar dust disk viewed almost edgeon from the Earth (Smith and Terrile, 1984; Paresce and Burrows, 1987; Golimowski et al., 1993, 2006; Kalas and Jewitt, 1995; Tamura et al., 2006). The disk is not primordial, but a dynamical consequence of debris that are continuously replenished by mutual collisions between planetesimals (Weissman, 1984; Backman et al., 1992; Backman and Paresce, 1993; Krivova et al., 2000). The location of the debris or dust is most likely confined near its parentbody planetesimals in nearly coplanar orbits (Krivov et al., 2000; Freistetter et al., 2007). This indicates that the spatial distribution of planetesimals can be traced through observed brightness profiles of the dust disk. A warp and rings in the inner disk suggest that the structures are formed by gravitational influences of planets on the planetesimals (Heap et al., 2000; Wahhaj et al., 2003; Okamoto et al., 2004; Freistetter et al., 2007). Surface brightness along the mid-plane of the β Pic disk shows a kink in its radial profile around 100 AU from the star (Golimowski et al., 1993, 2006; Kalas and Jewitt, 1995; Krivova et al., 2000). Such a brightness profile {{is consistent with the}} radial dust distribution that peaks around 100 AU, analogous to the dust in the Kuiper Belt (Backman et al., 1992; Backman and Paresce, 1993). These observations are well modeled under the assumption that planetesimals are <b>concentrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> of 80 – 120 AU (Augereau et al., 2001; Thébault and Augereau, 2005). It is worth noting that, in the solar system, a number of trans-neptunian objects in the Kuiper Belt are trapped in mean motion resonances (MMRs) with Neptune (Luu and Jewitt, 2002). Analogous to {{the outer edge of the}} Kuiper Belt at the 1 / 2 MMR with Neptune, the sharp drop in the surface density of β Pic planetesimals may be linked to the outer edge of a planetesimal belt at the 1 / 2 MMR with a yet unseen planet, which is hereafter referred to as Planet N. Near-infrared {{observations of}} linear polarization revealed a dip at 5.3 ± 0.1 arcsec (i.e., 102 – 104 AU) in the north-east and south-west directions of the β Pic disk (Tamura et al., 2006). We can interpret this dip as a paucity of planetesimals in the region from 1 / 2 MMR to 4 / 9 MMR with Planet N. Placing the dip in the middle of the 1 / 2 and 4 / 9 MMRs, we would find Planet N at 62 AU from the central star.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the results of high {{velocity}} resolution (0. 02 km s(- 1)) VLBA observations of the 12 GHz methanol masers toward the ultracompact (UC) H II region W 3 (OH). About 50 maser features are detected, and their emission is resolved both in velocity and in space (with an angular resolution of approximate to 1 mas). The maser feature spectra are very well reproduced by single Gaussian profiles, and a narrow distribution for the FWHM line widths is found from 0. 14 to 0. 32 km s(- 1). The measured brightness temperatures distribute over the range 10 (10) to 2 x 10 (12) K. By performing elliptical Gaussian fits, the spot parameters (peak position, intensity, and FWHM sizes) in the high velocity resolution maps were derived. The highest brightness temperatures occur in correspondence with the smallest spots, with FWHM size {{less than or equal to}} 4 AU. For all the maser features, it is found that the channel peak positions vary smoothly with the velocity, delineating straight or arclike distributions projected onto the sky. In most cases, the channel (line-of-sight) velocities vary linearly with the peak positional shifts, with measured gradients in the range 0. 05 - 0. 65 km s(- 1) mas(- 1) (0. 02 - 0. 30 km s(- 1) AU(- 1)). Most of the maser spot spectra have very small deviations from a Gaussian profile, less than or equal to 2 x 10 (- 3), and a trend for decreasing deviations with increasing intensities is noted. In most cases, the kurtosis of the spectral profiles is positive, with the most accurate values <b>concentrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> 0. 1 - 0. 5. Comparison of these results with recent calculations of the deviations from a Gaussian pro le that occur across the line pro le of a linear maser (as a result of the amplification process) suggests that the 12 GHz CH 3 OH masers are below the threshold, I- 0, at which line rebroadening occurs. However, the model predicts deviations from a Gaussian pro le significantly smaller than the observed values, and this discrepancy needs to be investigated. In particular, the calculations of the deviations from a Gaussian pro le should take into account the effects of a velocity gradient through the maser features (evidenced by our observations) that will influence the spectral pro le. The maximum output given by the pump rate of saturated masers may account for the observational result that the highest intensities are found in correspondence with the smallest sky-projected spot areas...|$|E

Quartz and calcite fracture cements from the Wufeng-Longmaxi shale intervals in four wells at depth intervals between 2253. 89 m and 3046. 60 m were investigated, and the fluid composition, temperature, and pressure during natural fracture cementation determined using an integrated approach consisting of petrography, Raman spectroscopy and microthermometry. Many crystals in fracture cements were found to contain methane inclusions only, and aqueous two-phase inclusions were consistently observed alongside methane inclusions in all cement samples, indicating that fluid inclusions trapped during fracture cementation are saturated with a methane hydrocarbon fluid. Homogenization temperatures of methane-saturated aqueous inclusions provide trends in trapping temperatures that Th values <b>concentrate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> of 198. 5 °C– 229. 9 °C, 196. 2 °C- 221. 7 °C for quartz and calcite, respectively. Pore-fluid pressures of 91. 8 – 139. 4 MPa for methane inclusions, calculated using the Raman shift of C-H symmetric stretching (v 1) band of methane and equations of state for supercritical methane, indicate fluid inclusions trapped at near-lithostatic pressures. High trapping temperature and overpressure conditions in fluid inclusions represent a state of temperature and overpressure of Wufeng-Longmaxi shales at maximum burial and the early stage of the Yanshanian uplift, which can provide a key evidence for understanding the formation and evolution of overpressure. Our results demonstrate that the main cause of present-day overpressure in shale gas deposits is actually the preservation of moderate-high overpressure developed as a result of gas generation at maximum burial depths...|$|R

This network features three-component recording with 24 -bit A/D conversion in the field. Continuous data are collected at 20 sps, and event triggered windows are collected at 100 sps. A seismic bulletin of events is made by automatically associating triggers among stations, classifying the local earthquake events, and locating the earthquakes and computing their magnitudes with conventional methods. This report covers the operational and seismic results of the fifth full year (FYOO) of the improved, digitally based, monitoring. The FYOO earthquake bulletin includes approximately 2300 events within about 50 km of Yucca Mountain. The largest event in FYOO, magnitude (ML) of 3. 1, is anomalously low relative to the largest events {{in each of the}} 22 prior years of monitoring. Nearly one-half of the FYOO earthquakes are concentrated in the aftershock zone of the 1992 Little Skull Mountain (LSM) earthquake. Another primary contribution to the catalog are aftershocks of the ML 4. 7 January 27, 1999, Frenchman Flat earthquake, which continued through FYOO. Hypocentral depths are largely <b>concentrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> of 7 - 12 km, consistent with previous years. This is primarily a consequence of the depth distribution of aftershocks of the LSM earthquake; the LSM rupture surface was confined to between 6 and 12 km. The observed minimum detection thresholds for earthquakes within the network range in ML from - 0. 3 to 0. 5 or greater, with the lower threshold achieved for earthquakes in the LSM and Yucca Mountain areas where the network is most dense. From the FYOO earthquakes, 28 new short-period first motion focal mechanisms were reliably determined. These, and the nearly 260 from the previous four years, show a consistent picture of the overall stress field in the region of the digital network. The tension axis is oriented at roughly 60 ° west of north, at shallow dip, and the pressure axis at roughly 30 ° east of north, with greater variability in the dip direction accounting for a collection of both strike-slip and dip-slip faulting within NW-SE extension. In FYOO three additional small events occurred within 10 km of the ESF, all with magnitudes 3 ̆c 0. First-motion focal mechanisms could not be determined for any of these due to the limited number of stations that detected the events. In addition, two events were located {{in the southern part of}} the Yucca Mountain block, more than 10 km from the ESF; and a first-motion focal mechanism could be determined for one of these...|$|E
40|$|Malaria is {{the cause}} of over one million deaths per year, {{primarily}} in African children. The parasite responsible for the most virulent form of malaria, is Plasmodium falciparum. Protein structure plays a pivotal role in elucidating mechanisms of parasite functioning and resistance to anti-malarial drugs. Protein structure furthermore aids the determination of protein function, which can together with the structure be used to identify novel drug targets in the parasite. However, various structural features in P. falciparum proteins complicate the experimental determination of protein three dimensional structures. Furthermore, the presence of parasite-specific inserts results in reduced similarity of these proteins to orthologous proteins with experimentally determined structures. The lack of solved structures in the malaria parasite, together with limited similarities to proteins in the Protein Data Bank, necessitate genome-scale structural annotation of P. falciparum proteins. Additionally, the annotation of a range of structural features facilitates the identification of suitable targets for structural studies. An integrated structural annotation system was constructed and applied to all the predicted proteins in P. falciparum, Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium yoelii. Similarity searches against the PDB, Pfam, Superfamily, PROSITE and PRINTS were included. In addition, the following predictions were made for the P. falciparum proteins: secondary structure, transmembrane helices, protein disorder, low complexity, coiled-coils and small molecule interactions. P. falciparum protein-protein interactions and proteins exported to the RBC were annotated from literature. Finally, a selection of proteins were threaded through a library of SCOP folds. All the results are stored in a relational PostgreSQL database and can be viewed through a web interface ([URL] In order to select groups of proteins which fulfill certain criteria with regard to structural and functional features, a query tool was constructed. Using this tool, criteria regarding {{the presence or absence of}} all the predicted features can be specified. Analysis of the results obtained revealed that P. falciparum protein-interacting proteins contain a higher percentage of predicted disordered residues than non-interacting proteins. Proteins interacting with 10 or more proteins have a disordered content <b>concentrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> of 60 - 100 %, while the disorder distribution for proteins having only one interacting partner, was more evenly spread. Comparisons of structural and sequence features between the three species, revealed that P. falciparum proteins tend to be longer and vary more in length than the other two species. P. falciparum proteins also contained more predicted low complexity and disorder content than proteins from P. yoelii and P. vivax. P. falciparumprotein targets for experimental structure determination, comparative modeling and in silico docking studies were putatively identified based on structural features. For experimental structure determination, 178 targets were identi_ed. These targets contain limited contents of predicted transmembrane helix, disorder, coiled-coils, low complexity and signal peptide, as these features may complicate steps in the experimental structure determination procedure. In addition, the targets display low similarity to proteins in the PDB. Comparisons of the targets to proteins with crystal structures, revealed that the structures and predicted targets had similar sequence properties and predicted structural features. A group of 373 proteins which displayed high levels of similarity to proteins in the PDB, were identified as targets for comparitive modeling studies. Finally, 197 targets for in silico docking were identified based on predicted small molecule interactions and the availability of a 3 D structure.

This network features three-component recording with 24 -bit A/D conversion in the field. Continuous data are collected at 20 sps, and event triggered windows are collected at 100 sps. A seismic bulletin of events is made by automatically associating triggers among stations, classifying the local earthquake events, and locating the earthquakes and computing their magnitudes with conventional methods. This report covers the operational and seismic results of the seventh year (FY 02) of the digital network monitoring. The FY 02 earthquake bulletin includes over 5000 events within about 65 km of Yucca Mountain. This is roughly twice {{the average number of}} events in the previous six years and is due to the occurrence of a significant M = 4. 4 earthquake on 06 / 14 / 2002 within the aftershock zone of the 1992 M = 5. 6 Little Skull Mountain earthquake. This event was followed by nearly 3000 aftershocks through September 30, 2002. Hypocentral depths of the recent aftershocks are largely <b>concentrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> of 8 - 12 km, consistent with previous years. Earthquakes outside the LSM aftershock zone are largely in the 4 - 12 km range. The observed minimum detection thresholds for earthquakes within the network range in ML from - 0. 5 to 0. 5 or greater, with the lower threshold achieved for earthquakes in the LSM and Yucca Mountain areas where the network is most dense. The M 4. 4 earthquake at Little Skull Mountain on 06 / 14 / 2002 was the major event in the network during FY 02. During FY 02 only the M 4. 4 Little Skull Mountain earthquake provided usable strong-motion recordings. The maximum acceleration of 0. 084 g was observed at the station LSC nearly directly above the hypocenter, and maximum accelerations in a range of. 004 to. 032 g were observed near Yucca Mountain, with top end of the range observed at station WHBS on the pad of the proposed Waste Handling Building. Recorded accelerations were roughly in agreement with those predicted in the PSHA (Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis) study for Yucca Mountain. From the FY 02 earthquakes, 46 new short-period, first-motion focal mechanisms were reliably determined. These, and the roughly 300 from the previous six years, show a consistent picture of the overall stress field in the region of the digital network. The mean tensional axis is oriented at roughly 60 ° west of north, at shallow dip, and the pressure axis at roughly 30 ° east of north, with greater variability in the dip direction accounting for a range of both strike-slip and dip-slip faulting within the general NW-SE extension. In FY 02 five additional small earthquakes occurred within 10 km of the ESF, all with magnitudes 3 ̆c 0. 0. In addition, a small earthquake was located {{in the southern part of}} the Yucca Mountain block, more than 10 km from the ESF, and another in Crater Flat. In the Death Valley region, two earthquakes measured M 3 ̆e 3 within the park boundaries. Little of the observed seismicity in the Death Valley region can be related to the two large faults there: Furnace Creek and Death Valley...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The growth {{process of}} {{synthetic}} diamond single crystals under high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) was investigated using acoustic emission (AE) technique. And AE parameters corresponding to growth process were analyzed. However, the AE features of diamond growth are relatively weak and easily obscured by other AE sources. So the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) {{was used to}} calculate the frequency spectra of AE signals for identifying different AE sources. The results showed that the variation of AE counts and energy is in a good agreement with the formation process of synthetic diamond crystals. And the AE signals pronounced from diamond growth are <b>concentrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> frequency <b>range</b> from 100 to 250 kHz. Thus, AE technique is an effective way to monitor and study the diamond growth, and the frequency analysis can be a useful way to identify different AE sources. ...|$|R
40|$|Activated Carbons (AC) are {{characterized}} by high specific surface area and high pore volume. They are mostly produced by activation of high carbon content precursors, for example petroleum coke (PC). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> present work samples of PC were chemically activated with potassium hydroxide (KOH). The activated PC presented high capacities of N 2 adsorption at 77 K, with pore volumes up to 1. 5 cm³ g- 1 and specific surface area up to 2500 m² g- 1. The pore size distributions obtained indicate that the activated PC has pore sizes <b>concentrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supermicroporous <b>range</b> (diameters between 0. 7 nm and 2 nm). The temperature and the impregnation ratio used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> activation process were the variables that mostly affected the porosity of the activated PC.

40|$|Abstract. Depressants used in {{flotation}} can inhibit floatable gangue minerals {{to improve}} concen-trate grade. In this paper, four different commonly used depressants were adopted {{in order to}} investigate the effect of depressants on chalcopyrite index and to investigate their inhibition effects on chalcopyrite flotation. The experimental results indicate that, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> flotation system of natural pH of pulp, mixed reagent of xanthate and aerofloat, sodium hexametaphosphate has the best effect on chalcopyrite separation, and <b>the</b> dosage <b>range</b> is 1. 5 - 1. 5 kg/t, it can improve the concentrate recovery as well as <b>concentrate</b> grade. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> of 0. 5 - 2. 5 kg/t, sodium silicate can improve the concentrate grade and concentrate recovery, but the amplitude is small.

Our new features are built on the basis of low-level visual features and spatial pooling. Incorporating spatial pooling improves the translational invariance and thus the robustness of the detection process. We then directly optimise the partial area under the ROC curve (pAUC) measure, which <b>concentrates</b> detection performance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> of most practical importance. The combination of these factors leads to a pedestrian detec-tor which outperforms all competitors on all of the standard benchmark datasets.

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the {{sound pressure level}} to which preschool students are exposed. Method: This was a prospective, quantitative, nonexperimental, and descriptive study. To achieve {{the aim of the}} study we used an audio dosimeter. The sound pressure level (SPL) measurements were obtained for 2 age based classrooms. Preschool I and II. The measurements were obtained over 4 days in 8 -hour sessions, totaling 1920 minutes. Results: Compared with established standards, <b>the</b> SPL measured <b>ranged</b> from 40. 6 dB (A) to 105. 8 dB (A). The frequency spectrum of <b>the</b> SPL was <b>concentrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> frequency <b>range</b> between 500 Hz and 4000 Hz. The older children produced higher SPLs than the younger ones, and the levels varied according to the activity performed.

40|$|Information on {{the fishery}} {{resources}} of the deeper waters, beyond 100 m off the Indian coast is scanty. The exploratory trawling operations {{carried out by the}} Indo-Norwegian Project vessels from 1964 onwards in depths ranging from 120 m to 430 m, covering over 5, 000 square kilometres, along the south-west coast of India showed the presence of considerable quantities of deep-sea prawns along with lobsters, crabs and fishes. The analysis of the catch data of over 2 S 0 hauls made from these depths has enabled to assess the productivity of these groimds <b>in</b> respect of <b>the</b> newly found prawn resources.

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} fouling {{experiments were}} carried out in a temperature controlled stirred vessel using aqueous solutions of whey protein <b>concentrate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> concentration <b>range</b> of 3 to 3. 5 wt- % at a bulk temperature of 50 °C and pH of 6. Heat transfer data were obtained from thermocouples embedded in an immersed electrical heating rod with various metal plates attached with-and-without surface treatments. Measurements included solution temperature, heating element surface temperature, and heat duty. Results are presented as fouling resistance versus time for aluminum, copper, stainless steel, electro-polished stainless steel, and surfaces coated with DLC and doped with Si, SiO, as well as DLC-coating of an electro-polished stainless steel. Reducing surface roughness was found to mitigate fouling but the combination of both surface treatments, DLC coatings, and electro-polishing gave the best performance. The experimental results demonstrate the potential and value for reducing the adhesive behavior of whey protein fouling layers using modified surfaces. Also a comparison of these results with those for crystallization fouling show the same effects of the surface modification on nucleation and crystal growth. Of particular importance is the influence on the cleaning performance where the main potential can be expected...|$|R
40|$|The spin-dependent {{absorption}} of circularly polarized x-rays is studied at theL-edges of ferromagnetic Gd and Tb metal. At theL 1 -edge a spin-dependent {{part of the}} absorption coefficient of 10 − 3 – 10 − 2 is observed. Strong resonance absorption known as “white line” occurs at theL 2 - andL 3 -absorption onset. Correlated with it one finds large spin-dependent absorption effects with amplitudes of a few percent. The spin-dependent absorption spectra reflect the profiles of the spin densities of <b>the</b> states populated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absorption process.
