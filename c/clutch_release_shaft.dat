Special attention is given the problem of simulating start and stop of a vehicle with rolling resistance at zero speed. Only principles for simulating the system with variable structure is of interest and therefore the models are maintained at lowest possible complexity. The system is successfully simulated and the validation is performed using three scenarios: one with only clutch lock and <b>clutch</b> <b>release,</b> one with start and stop of vehicle, and one full European drive-cycle...|$|R

Fatigue life analysis {{is based on}} the release bearing rings or rolling body began to appear fatigue spalling, in which this kind of phenomenon is under cyclic stress. The contact stress distribution is not uniform, the contact stress is mainly concentrated near the surface; influenced by the geometry and physical properties and lubrication of the surface significantly. Contact between the two types of fatigue crack extension methods: fatigue crack surface under expansion and surface fatigue crack propagation. The surface crack growth mainly originated from two kinds of cases: crack caused by surface pre crack and contact between the two surface asperity each other. New life prediction model for the release bearing based on L-P theory and Tallian model,in which influence factors of fatigue life is introduced on the smelting process, surface defect, surface roughness, residual stress, elastohydrodynamic lubrication oil film, environmental cleanliness, temperature, the effect of varying load characteristics and other factors of fatigue life. The results show that: the <b>clutch</b> <b>release</b> bearing life prediction model of new and more close to the real conditions of automobile clutch, provide the theory basis {{for the development of a}} new generation high-speed heavy-duty <b>clutch</b> <b>release</b> bearing of the commercial vehicle...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A typical {{clutch system}} for {{automotive}} manual transmissions transfers hydraulic pressure generated by driver's pedal manipulation to the clutch diaphragm spring. The foot effort history {{during the period}} of push is different than the period of the clutch pedal’s return. The effort or load difference is called clutch foot effort hysteresis. It is known that the hysteresis is caused by friction. The frictional force and moment are produced between various component contact points such as between the rubber seal and the inner wall inside the hydraulic cylinder and between the diaphragm spring and the pressure plate, etc. Understanding the clutch pedal foot effort hysteresis is essential for a <b>clutch</b> <b>release</b> system design and analysis. The dynamic model for a <b>clutch</b> <b>release</b> system is developed for the foot effort hysteresis prediction and a simulation analysis is performed to propose a tool for analysing a clutch system...|$|R

25|$|The {{simplest}} single-engine {{steering system}} in mechanical terms, and almost universally used on early tank designs, was {{the combination of}} a brake and a clutch connected to steering controls. The controls were normally a pair of vertical handles, one for each track. Pulling on a handle disengaged the <b>clutch,</b> <b>releasing</b> that track and causing it to slow down. Further motion of the handle increasingly applied the brake to that track, allowing the turning circle to be adjusted.|$|R

50|$|Typically a {{centrifugal}} clutch and sprocket.The {{centrifugal clutch}} expands with raising spinning speed towards a drum. On this drum sits either a fixed sprocket or an exchangeable one. The clutch has three jobs to do: When the saw runs idle (typically 2500-2700 rpm) the chain does not move. When the clutch is engaged and the chain {{stops in the}} wood or another reason, it protects the engine. Most important it protects the operator {{in case of a}} kickback. Here the chain break stops the drum and the <b>clutch</b> <b>releases</b> immediately.|$|R
50|$|The F23 has two gearsets on each {{of three}} {{parallel}} shafts - the input shaft, the output shaft, and the intermediate shaft. This three-shaft (also called three-axis) design results {{in a very short}} axial length for better packaging. There are three separate shift fork shafts, which hold three shift forks to activate the synchronizer rings for the two gearsets {{on each of}} the three gear shafts. The shift forks are activated by a cable system. The <b>clutch</b> <b>release</b> bearing is operated by a concentric slave cylinder that surrounds the input shaft in the clutch housing. A concentric slave cylinder allows more linear clutch feel than an external lever-actuated <b>clutch</b> and <b>release</b> bearing. The input shaft carries the 3rd and 4th gear synchronizer, the intermediate shaft carries the 1st and 2nd gear synchronizer, and the output shaft carries the 5th and reverse gear synchronizer. The aluminium case contains a conventional final drive gearset.|$|R
