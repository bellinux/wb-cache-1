Next, an easy method to determine optimal division plan of peripheral pipelines is proposed {{on the basis of the}} importance and degree of damage of each potential division. By use of this method, average time for restoration can be minimized with a given number of divisions. Some illustrative examples have been shown...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Hazardous wastes {{are applied}} to the wastes that due to having {{features}} such as toxicity, corrosivity, ignitability, reactivity or other similar characteristics jeopardize man s health and environment or somehow bring about this possibility. Hazardous wastes are produced from several industrial and commercial sources, agricultural or even domestic activities. The risks {{of this kind of}} materials are very different according to the type of hazardous wastes and environmental conditions. Different effects including acute, chronic, short-term and long-term are to be expected. Economic and health consideration initiated a study aiming to identify hazardous wastes in Fars province that has {{an important role in the}} developing industry of Iran. In this study the necessary data are gathered through questionnaire, interviewing the authorities of the units and referring to the available documents. The information encompasses the type and amount of waste, method of temporary storage, period of waste discharge, method of final disposal and the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> and reuse of waste. Also for storing and analyzing the data, "waste database " has been made. The results attained from analyzing the information indicate the production of 1049042 tones of industrial wastes, 13701 tones of hospital wastes and 135563 liters agricultural wastes in the current year (2006 - 2007), the waste production ratio of different industrial groups is obtained as 31 % by chemical industries, 16 % by oil and coke industries and 53 % by other industries.

40|$|Human {{pluripotent}} {{stem cells}} derived cardiomyoctyes are one the most promising cells for cardiac research, i. e. disease modeling, drug screening and cell therapy applications. Obtaining these cells is a critical step and {{has been the subject}} of many studies and publications. Recent advances in this field have shown that a sequential activation and inhibition of the Wnt pathway induces the differentiation of human {{pluripotent stem cells}} toward the cardiac lineage. This procedure can be achieved in a chemically-defined environment, and beating cells are obtained after 8 days. Several parameters of this protocol could still be improved. For example, the small molecules used (Wnt activators and inhibitors) are not approved by the health authorities, preventing their use in clinical studies. Moreover, there are no standard procedures to recover the cardiomyocytes after the differentiation protocol. Finally, late-stage differentiation to a totally matured ventricular cardiomyocyte population has not been achieved for the moment. The immature cardiac cells obtained have several differences compared to adult cardiomyocytes. There are, for example, mismatches in cell size and shape, gap junction, alignment and calcium handling ability. Raise these technological barriers could lead to new perspectives in the use of these cells. Our studies in this area have led us to develop innovative strategies to obtain, recover and to mature these cells. We have tested several FDAapproved drugs known to modulate the Wnt pathway in order to obtain a clinical- grade population cardiomyocytes. We also determined, using a combination of protease, the <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> allowing the best survival rate and function of these cells. Finally, we improve the maturity of cardiomyocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells by tuning their micro-environment.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the second}} {{of a series of}} two papers, a refined closed-form {{analysis}} method for the calculation of interlaminar stress concentrations in the vicinity of rectangular wedges of thermally loaded composite laminates with arbitrary layup is presented. Based on adequate layerwise shape assumptions for the in-plane components of Cauchy’s stress tensor that automatically fulfill the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> traction free edges, the interlaminar stresses are derived from the three-dimensional equilibrium conditions in combination with the exact fulfillment of the given homogeneous boundary <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> traction-free laminate facings and the requirement of continuity of the interlaminar stresses at the ply interfaces. The far field <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> the stress results by classical laminate plate theory in the inner laminate regions with increasing distance from the laminate corner are accounted for. Free constants in the stress shape functions are determined by the minimization of the laminate’s complementary potential energy which can be accomplished in an iterative manner. The stress shape functions are assumed as simple exponential terms with respect to the in-plane coordinates, whereas polynomials are applied as thickness functions. The present analysis methodology is found to be in good agreement with finite-element computations and yields reasonably accurate results with little computational effort.

40|$|Stakeholder {{participation}} is widely acknowledged {{as a critical}} component <b>of</b> post-disaster <b>recovery</b> because it helps create a shared understanding of local hazard risk and vulnerability, improves recovery and mitigation decision efficacy, and builds social capital and local resilience to future disasters. But approaches commonly used to facilitate participation and empower local communities depend on lengthy consensus-building processes which is not conducive to time-constrained post-disaster recovery. Moreover, these approaches are often criticized for being overly technocratic and ignoring existing community power and trust structures. Therefore, {{there is a need}} for more nuanced, analytical and applied research on stakeholder participation in planning for post-disaster recovery. This research examines participatory behavior of three stakeholder groups (government agencies, non-local non-government organizations, local community-based organizations) in three coastal village communities of Nagapattinam (India) that were recovering from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The study found eight different forms of participation and non-participation in the case study communities, ranging from 'transformative' participation to 'marginalized' non-participation. These forms of participation and non-participatory behavior emanated from the negotiation of four factors, namely stakeholder power, legitimacy, trust, and urgency for action.

Clinical definition <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> usually comprises symptomatic remission {{and adequate}} functioning. However, a local qualitative study confirmed that cessation of medication is one <b>of</b> the necessary <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> {{as perceived by}} patients. This cross-sectional study aimed to explore whether perceived extent <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> was related to clinical symptoms (positive, negative, and depressive) and executive function. METHODS: Patients were asked to assess their perceived extent <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> after 6 months of psychiatric treatment by a visual analogue scale based on the Psychosis Recovery Inventory developed by Chen and his colleagues (2005). The subjective ratings were later converted into scores ranging from 0 to 100 (full recovery) and compared with the operationally defined remission and recovery by t-tests. The definition of remission was operationally defined by Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms and Scale for the Assessment <b>of</b> Negative Symptoms. <b>Recovery</b> was defined as remission plus an additional criterion of adequate functioning as measured by Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale. Multiple linear regression was used to correlate the subjective ratings with symptoms, and executive function as measured by Modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (MWCST), semantic verbal fluency (animals) and trail making task. RESULTS: This study had assessed 78 Chinese patients with psychotic disorders in Hong Kong. 47 (60. 3 %) of them were male. The median duration of untreated psychosis was 121 days. The median (inter-quartile range) and mean (s. d.) scores <b>of</b> perceived <b>recovery</b> were 80 (26. 3) and 73. 4 (21. 6) respectively. 42 (53. 8 %) patients perceived at least 80 % recovery while 9 (11. 5 %) perceived full recovery. Clinically, 62 (79. 5 %) and 30 (38. 5 %) patients were categorized as in remission and recovery. Patients who had achieved remission or recovery had no difference in their perceived recovery from patients who did not (P = 0. 12 and P = 0. 28, respectively). The multiple linear regression showed that patients perceived greater recovery had fewer perseverative errors in MWCST (adjusted R 2 = 0. 095, P = 0. 004). Perceived recovery was not significantly correlated with positive, negative and depressive symptoms.
