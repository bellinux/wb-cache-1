Malkani says that awareness is already a reality and suggests {{there would be no}} need to examine the <b>creative</b> <b>activity</b> subjected to awareness.|$|E

25|$|The {{paradox of}} the early Bauhaus was that, {{although}} its manifesto proclaimed that the aim of all <b>creative</b> <b>activity</b> was building, the school did not offer classes in architecture until 1927. During the years under Gropius (1919–1927), {{he and his partner}} Adolf Meyer observed no real distinction between the output of his architectural office and the school. So the built output of Bauhaus architecture in these years is the output of Gropius: the Sommerfeld house in Berlin, the Otte house in Berlin, the Auerbach house in Jena, and the competition design for the Chicago Tribune Tower, which brought the school much attention. The definitive 1926 Bauhaus building in Dessau is also attributed to Gropius. Apart from contributions to the 1923 Haus am Horn, student architectural work amounted to un-built projects, interior finishes, and craft work like cabinets, chairs and pottery.|$|E
25|$|The sacred texts {{found in}} Agama Hindu Dharma are the Vedas and Upanishads. They {{are the basis}} of Indian and Balinese Hinduism. Other sources of {{religious}} information include the Universal Hindu Puranas and the Itihasa (mainly Ramayana and the Mahabharata). The epics Mahabharata and Ramayana became enduring traditions among Indonesian believers, expressed in shadow puppet (wayang) and dance performances. As in India, Indonesian Hinduism recognizes four paths of spirituality, calling it Catur Marga. These are bhakti mārga (path of devotion to deities), jnana mārga (path of knowledge), karma mārga (path of works) and raja mārga (path of meditation). Bhakti marga has the largest following in Bali. Similarly, like Hindus in India, Balinese Hindus {{believe that there are}} four proper goals of human life, calling it Catur Purusartha - dharma (pursuit of moral and ethical living), artha (pursuit of wealth and <b>creative</b> <b>activity),</b> kama (pursuit of joy and love) and moksha (pursuit of self-knowledge and liberation).|$|E

The Russian scientists N.I. Veselovskiy, N.S. Likoshin, V.L. Vyatkin expressed important ideas about Mashrab`s creative works in 19th and 20th centuries. Also some specialists in Uzbek literature such as I. Sulton, V. Zohidov, I. Muminov, G. Gulom, A.Hayitmetov, A. Abdugafurov, E. Shodiyev, V.
