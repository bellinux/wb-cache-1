40|$|A cracked ARIS <b>casing</b> <b>ring</b> {{belonging}} to a helicopter was forwarded to this laboratory for analysis. Examination revealed a crack {{in one of the}} fastener holes on one of the flanges meant for fixing torsion torque plates. The crack was found to have initiated at corrosion pits on the fastener hole surface and propagated progressively by fatigue mechanism over more than 95 % of the cross sectional area. Considering the area fraction over which the fatigue crack has propagated, it can be stated that the fatigue was of low stress – high cycle type. The material of construction was found to conform to design specification, and no metallurgical abnormalities were responsible for the failure...|$|E
30|$|The air {{injection}} connector system {{is also known}} as parasitic pipe joints. In the past, underbalanced drilling was usually realized by the principle of the “U-tube”, which means another injection well must be made first to form a “U-tube” with the production well to inject high-pressure air when the production well is being drilled. In order to reduce the budget of drilling and to eliminate hazards with few engineering work, the injection well was replaced by the {{air injection}} connector system, which is connected on the production casing at a predetermined position down {{into the bottom of the}} well with the casing. It will then open a valve to inject air into the <b>casing</b> <b>ring</b> space during drilling to realize underbalanced drilling (Xian et al. 2009). In order to meet the technical requirements of the above process, the air injection connector system must consist of a non-return valve to eliminate backflow. It must be sent downhole together with the casing and be cemented disposable with the casing. After completion of the first phase of drilling process, the air injection connector could be used to inject high-pressure air in the next phase of drilling process. The pressurized air mixed with the drilling mud would help to increase the performance of underbalanced drilling (Fried et al. 1996; Bennion et al. 1998; Misselbrook et al. 1991; Oyatomari et al. 2002).|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} investigates {{a range of}} issues {{relating}} to the use of a vane-recessed tubular-passage casing treatment as a passive stall control technique in a multistage axial-flow compressor. The focus of the research was to determine whether such a treatment could delay the initiation of stall at lower mass flow rates as well as providing the most beneficial improvement in flow characteristics without sacrificing compressor efficiencies. Specific objectives of this study were to examine possible improvements or deterioration in the flow characteristics including stall margin, peak pressure rise coefficients and maximum efficiency in a multistage axial flow compressor. A casing treatment in addition to several spacer rings was developed from two initial designs and tested on the first stage of a low speed three-stage axial-flow compressor with a (0. 7) hub to tip diameter ratio. The treatment configuration consisted of three parts: an outer <b>casing</b> <b>ring,</b> with a tubular shaped passage on the inside diameter, a set of 120 evenly spaced curved vanes, and a shroud or inner ring. The casing treatment was positioned following the inlet guide vanes upstream and partly covering the tip of the rotor blades. The main parts of the casing treatment including the recessed vanes in addition to some of the spacer rings were manufactured from high quality acrylic. Eight additional spacer rings of various shapes and geometry were added. The first ring held and partly covered the IGVs, in front of the casing treatment. The rotor tip exposure ratio was thought to {{have a significant impact on}} the effectiveness of the casing treatment. Therefore the other seven rings were used to provide the desired uncovered region of the rotor tip axial chord of about 10 % in order to provide a range of exposures of (23. 2 %, 33. 3 %, 43. 4 %, 53. 5 %, 63. 6 %, 73. 7 %, and 83. 8 %). The results showed significant improvements in stall margin in all treated casing configurations along with insignificant efficiency sacrifices in some compressor builds. About (28. 56 %) of stall margin improvement in terms of corrected mass flow rate was achieved using a casing treatment with a (33. 3 %) rotor tip exposure. The compressor build with (0. 535) rotor exposure ratios was the best configuration in terms of efficiency gain and loss characteristics. This build was able to provide the highest values of the maximum efficiencies in comparison with the performance achieved from the solid casing. An improvement of (1. 81 %) in the maximum efficiency in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, in association with a (22. 54 %) stall margin improvement in terms of the corrected mass flow rates were achieved by the application of this treatment configuration. The improvement in the peak pressure rise coefficients in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, obtained from this build was (2. 33 %). The compressor configuration using a casing treatment with a (0. 636) rotor exposure ratio was the best build in terms of the pressure rise coefficients. This configuration was able to provide highest value of the peak pressure rise in comparison with the characteristics achieved from the datum build. An improvement of (2. 65 %) in the peak pressure rise coefficient in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, in association with a (22. 49 %) improvement in stall margin in terms of the corrected mass flow rates was achieved from this casing treatment build. The improvement in maximum efficiency in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, obtained from this build was (1. 03 %). The results suggest that the vane-recessed tubular-passage casing treatment designed as part of this investigation achieved the objectives, which were established for the research. In the majority of instances it not only produced gains in flow range, pressure rise coefficients and efficiencies, but also enabled the rotating stall, which developed at much lower mass flow rates in the compressor, to become progressive rather than abrupt...|$|E

Its flow rate limits to cooling water discharge, output to fan, and head to energy-saving of cooling water system, so its specific speed is very low, hydraulic loss of spiral <b>casing</b> and stay <b>ring</b> is high to reduce hydraulic efficiency of water turbine. To increase the hydraulic efficiency, a pump <b>casing</b> and stay <b>ring</b> with no stay vane is designed. Through CFD simulation and test, hydraulic efficiency of water turbine with that spiral <b>casing</b> and stay <b>ring</b> is improved to 5 %, hydraulic loss of <b>casing</b> and stay <b>ring</b> reduces from 13. 7 % to 3. 41 %, hydraulic loss of runner increases from 7. 93 % to 11. 57 %, and simulation result coincides with test. If that spiral <b>casing</b> and stay <b>ring</b> links to runner with no angle of blade attack, hydraulic loss of runner is about 7 % and hydraulic efficiency reaches to 82 %...|$|R

Liquid (usually water) is {{fed into the}} pump and, by centrifugal acceleration, forms a moving cylindrical ring against {{the inside of the}} <b>casing.</b> This liquid <b>ring</b> creates a series of seals in the space between the impeller vanes, which form compression chambers. The eccentricity between the impeller's axis of rotation and the casing geometric axis results in a cyclic variation of the volume enclosed by the vanes and the ring.|$|R

Moderate aerodynamic loading for both stages is used to achieve {{the high level of}} turbine efficiency. Flowpath components are designed for 18, 000 hours of life, while the static and rotating structures are designed for 36, 000 hours of engine operation. Both stages of turbine blades and vanes are air-cooled incorporating advanced state of the art in cooling technology. Direct solidification (DS) alloys are used for blades and one stage of vanes, and an oxide dispersion system (ODS) alloy is used for the Stage 1 nozzle airfoils. Ceramic shrouds are used as the material composition for the Stage 1 shroud. An active clearance control (ACC) system is used to control the blade tip to shroud clearances for both stages. Fan air is used to impinge on the shroud <b>casing</b> support <b>rings,</b> thereby controlling the growth rate of the shroud.

2500|$|The final, {{and most}} {{commonly}} used type of combustor is the fully annular combustor. [...] Annular combustors {{do away with the}} separate combustion zones and simply have a continuous liner and <b>casing</b> in a <b>ring</b> (the annulus). There are many advantages to annular combustors, including more uniform combustion, shorter size (therefore lighter), and less surface area. Additionally, annular combustors tend to have very uniform exit temperatures. They also have the lowest pressure drop of the three designs (on the order of 5%). The annular design is also simpler, although testing generally requires a full size test rig. An engine that uses an annular combustor is the CFM International CFM56. Almost all of the modern gas turbine engines use annular combustors; likewise, most combustor research and development focuses on improving this type.|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 139 - 148 The {{operating}} temperatures of hot gas expanders can cause degradation {{in the material}} capabilities of both the rotating and stationary components. For this reason, many {{of the components of}} the expanders are life limited. Operation beyond the design or useful life of a component can lead to inservice component failures. The determination of when the various components require replacement has been a difficult one for the operators of the equipment since the effects of high temperature operation often are not readily detectable via visual or conventional non-destructive techniques. The life of components (<b>casings,</b> nosecone, shroud <b>rings,</b> rotor blades, rotor discs, etc.) is dependent upon the individual component's operating conditions and consideration must be given to both steady and transient operation. Techniques are described along with the equipment that has been developed and utilized in several field installations to assist in the determination of the useful life of expander components. Examples of the findings from typical field life evaluations are presented. In addition to the metallurgical evaluations, the component design capabilities, service conditions, and operating history must also be evaluated. While these techniques have been developed for the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) hot gas expander, they are directly applicable to other high temperature turbines such as gas, steam, and other expander applications...|$|R
