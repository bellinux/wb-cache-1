5000|$|Many {{sophisticated}} advertisements {{are printed}} in the guide. Most are directed at the Fair going public. In fact, the blending of content and advertisement is so sophisticated that it is, in places, nearly impossible {{to distinguish between the}} two. A two-page <b>color</b> <b>advertisement</b> for the Eastman Kodak Pavilion (billed as the [...] "Focal Point of the Fair"), advertises not Kodak product, but the Pavilion itself. [...] Other exhibitors ran advertisement for their products alongside advertisement for their pavilion. American Express, for example, ran an illustration of [...] "The $1 Million Money Tree", exhibited at their pavilion, over a partial list of their products.|$|E

5000|$|The New York Posts {{film critic}} Kyle Smith claimed {{the film was}} [...] "another hateful and boring attack on Catholics." [...] He called it [...] "90 minutes of {{organized}} hate" [...] and claimed that: [...] "A film that is half as harsh on Judaism or Islam, of course, wouldn’t {{be made in the}} first place but would be universally reviled if it were." [...] Philomena Lee responded to Smith with an open letter that said: The story it tells has resonated with people not because it’s some mockery of ideas or institutions that they’re in disagreement with. This is not a rally cry against the church or politics. In fact, despite some of the troubles that befell me as a young girl, I have always maintained a very strong hold on my faith. Producer Harvey Weinstein took out a full-page <b>color</b> <b>advertisement</b> in The New York Times that quoted some favorable reviews and part of Smith's review accompanied by an excerpt from Lee's letter, and invited the public to make its own decision. Smith had accused several other films that were produced by Weinstein for anti-Catholicism, including The Magdalene Sisters (2002), The Butcher Boy (1998), and Priest (1995) - all critically acclaimed movies.|$|E

40|$|Eye {{design in}} {{invertebrates}} is diverse and {{gives rise to}} a variety of color-vision systems. The most sophisticated color vision has been found in marine crustaceans - mantis shrimps. These shrimps use for color vision 12 spectrally different photoreceptors, while many other crustaceans have only two types of spectrally selective photoreceptors. Arthrophods photoreceptors are inherently polarization sensitive and in some insects the sense of polarization is mixed with the sense of color. Unlike most vertebrates, who are color blind in nocturnal conditions, some insects retain the sense of color in very dim light. Many invertebrates use body <b>colors</b> for <b>advertisement</b> and many insects forage on brightly colored flowers.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. A {{survey was}} {{administered}} to 488 students in the School of Family, Consumer, and Nutrition Sciences to assess perceptions of the portrayal of older adults in magazine advertisements featured during 1978 and 1998. The instrument consisted of eighteen <b>color</b> <b>advertisements</b> from 1978 and 1998 issues of nine popular magazines. Using a semantic differential scale, students rated each advertisement on six pairs of adjectives: passive lifestyle/active lifestyle, foolish/wise, independent/dependent, happy/unhappy, sickly/healthy, attractive/unattractive. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) tested for differences in perceptions of the portrayal of older adult models in 1978 and 1998 advertisements. Overall, 1978 models were portrayed more positively. Specifically, models in 1998 advertisements were perceived to be more independent, happy, and attractive than 1978 models, while those in 1978 advertisements were rated as more wise, healthy, active, and more positive overall than 1998 models.

The 665 advertisements subsequently examined were studied for certain predetermined parameters in order to indicate trends. The trend results may be summarized as follows. As an extension of prescription drug advertising trends in general, oral hypoglycemic drug advertising showed an increasing length along with a subsequent decrease {{in the amount of}} space devoted to the copy portion of the advertisement. They also showed a decrease in the use of statistical information and rarely made references to competitors.
