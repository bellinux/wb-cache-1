2500|$|In alien hand syndrome, {{the afflicted}} individual's limb will produce unintentional {{movements}} without {{the will of}} the person. The affected limb effectively demonstrates 'a will of its own.' The sense of agency does not emerge in conjunction with the overt appearance of the purposeful act even though the sense of ownership in relationship to the body part is maintained. This phenomenon corresponds with an impairment in the premotor mechanism manifested temporally by the appearance of the readiness potential (see section on the Neuroscience of Free Will above) recordable on the scalp several hundred milliseconds before the overt appearance of a spontaneous willed movement. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging with specialized multivariate analyses to study the temporal dimension in the activation of the <b>cortical</b> <b>network</b> associated with voluntary movement in human subjects, an anterior-to-posterior sequential activation process beginning in the supplementary motor area on the medial surface of the frontal lobe and progressing to the primary motor cortex and then to parietal cortex has been observed. The sense of agency thus appears to normally emerge in conjunction with this orderly sequential network activation incorporating premotor association cortices together with primary motor cortex. In particular, the supplementary motor complex on the medial surface of the frontal lobe appears to activate prior to primary motor cortex presumably in associated with a preparatory pre-movement process. In a recent study using functional magnetic resonance imaging, alien movements were characterized by a relatively isolated activation of the primary motor cortex contralateral to the alien hand, while voluntary movements of the same body part included the concomitant activation of motor association cortex associated with the premotor process. The clinical definition requires [...] "feeling that one limb is foreign or has a will of its own, together with observable involuntary motor activity" [...] (emphasis in original). This syndrome is often a result of damage to the corpus callosum, either when it is severed to treat intractable epilepsy or due to a stroke. The standard neurological explanation is that the felt will reported by the speaking left hemisphere does not correspond with the actions performed by the non-speaking right hemisphere, thus suggesting that the two hemispheres may have independent senses of will.|$|E

To reveal how <b>cortical</b> <b>networks</b> develop spontaneous activity, or conversely, how spontaneous activity structures <b>cortical</b> <b>networks,</b> we analyze the self-organization of a recurrent network model of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, which is realistic enough to replicate UP-DOWN states, with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). The individual neurons in the self-organized network exhibit a variety of temporal patterns in the two-state transitions. In addition, the model develops a feed-forward network-like structure that produces a diverse repertoire of precise sequences of the UP state.

40|$|Introduction: Stroke {{remains a}} {{leading cause of}} {{long-term}} disability. Functional imaging studies report widespread changes in movement-related <b>cortical</b> <b>networks</b> after stroke. Whether these are a result of stroke-specific cognitive processes or reflect modulation of existing movement related networks is unknown. Understanding this distinction is critical in establishing more effective restorative therapies after stroke. Here we use multivariate analysis (tensor-independent component analysis - TICA) to map the array of neural networks involved during motor imagery (MI) and executed movement (EM) in subcortical stroke patients and age-matched controls. Methods: Twenty subcortical stroke patients and seventeen age-matched controls were recruited and screened for their ability to carry out MI (Chaotic MI Assessment). fMRI consisted of an auditory-paced (1 Hz) right hand finger-thumb opposition sequence (2, 3, 4, 5; 2 …) with two separate runs acquired (MI & rest and EM & rest; block design). No distinction was made between groups or tasks until the final stage of processing. This allowed TICA to identify independent-components (IC) that were common or distinct to each group or task with no prior assumptions. Results: TICA defined 28 ICs. Non-significant ICs and those representing artifact were excluded. Only components in which the subject scores were significantly different to zero (for either EM or MI) were included. Seven independent components remained that involved the primary and secondary motor networks. All ICs were shared between the stroke and age-matched controls. Five ICs were common to both tasks and three were exclusive to EM. Two ICs were related to motor recovery and one with time since stroke onset, but all were shared with age-matched controls. No IC was exclusive to stroke patients. Conclusion: We report that the <b>cortical</b> <b>networks</b> in stroke patients that relate to recovery of motor function represent modulation of existing <b>cortical</b> <b>networks</b> present in age-matched controls. The absence of <b>cortical</b> <b>networks</b> specific to stroke patients suggests that motor adaptation and other potential confounds (e. g. effort, additional muscle use) are not responsible for the changes in the <b>cortical</b> <b>networks</b> reported after stroke. This highlights that recovery of motor function after subcortical stroke involves preexisting <b>cortical</b> <b>networks</b> which could help identify more effective restorative therapies...|$|R

Particularly notable is the prominent structural role of the precuneus, a region that is homologous to the highly connected posteromedial cortex in the macaque.

The anterior fusiform gyrus {{is affected by the}} semantic context, and whether letter combinations are words or pseudowords (novel letter combinations that mimic phonetic conventions, ex. shing). This role of the anterior fusiform gyrus may correlate to higher processing of the word's concept and meaning.

5000|$|In 2015, a {{systematic}} review and a meta-analysis {{of high quality}} clinical trials found that, when used at low (therapeutic) doses, amphetamine produces modest yet unambiguous improvements in cognition, including working memory, long-term episodic memory, inhibitory control, and some aspects of attention, in normal healthy adults; these cognition-enhancing effects of amphetamine {{are known to be}} partially mediated through the indirect activation of both dopamine receptor D1 and adrenoceptor α2 in the prefrontal cortex. A systematic review from 2014 found that low doses of amphetamine also improve memory consolidation, in turn leading to improved recall of information. Therapeutic doses of amphetamine also enhance <b>cortical</b> <b>network</b> efficiency, an effect which mediates improvements in working memory in all individuals. Amphetamine and other ADHD stimulants also improve task saliency (motivation to perform a task) and increase arousal (wakefulness), in turn promoting goal-directed behavior.

Based upon studies of self-reported illicit stimulant use, 5-35% of college students use diverted ADHD stimulants, which are primarily used for performance enhancement rather than as recreational drugs.

5000|$|A 2009 fMRI study {{looking at}} the {{temporal}} sequence of activation of components of a <b>cortical</b> <b>network</b> associated with voluntary movement in normal individuals demonstrated [...] "an anterior-to-posterior temporal gradient of activity from supplemental motor area through premotor and motor cortices to the posterior parietal cortex". Therefore, with normal voluntary movement, the emergent sense of agency appears {{to be associated with}} an orderly sequence of activation that develops initially in the anteromedial frontal cortex {{in the vicinity of the}} supplementary motor complex on the medial surface of the frontal aspect of the hemisphere (including the supplementary motor area) prior to activation of the primary motor cortex in the pre-central gyrus on the lateral aspect of the hemisphere, when hand movement is being generated. Activation of the primary motor cortex, presumed to be directly involved in the execution of the action via projections into the corticospinal component of the pyramidal tracts, is then followed by activation of the posterior parietal cortex, possibly related to the receipt of recurrent or re-afferent somatosensory feedback generated from the periphery by the movement which would normally interact with the efference copy transmitted from primary motor cortex to permit the movement to be recognized as self-generated rather than imposed by an external force. That is, the efference copy allows the recurrent afferent somatosensory flow from the periphery associated with the self-generated movement to be recognized as re-afference as distinct from ex-afference. Failure of this mechanism may lead to a failure to distinguish between self-generated and externally generated movement of the limb. This anomalous situation in which re-afference from a self-generated movement is mistakenly registered as ex-afference due to a failure to generate and successfully transmit an efference copy to sensory cortex, could readily lead to the interpretation that what is in actuality a self-generated movement has been produced by an external force as a result of the failure to develop a sense of agency in association with emergence of the self-generated movement (see below for a more detailed discussion).|$|E
