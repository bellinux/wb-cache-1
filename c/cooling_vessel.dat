40|$|Bibliography: pages 106 - 109. This thesis {{describes}} {{techniques for}} the correction of spatial noise artifacts in a {{mercury cadmium telluride}} infrared camera system. The spatial noise artifacts {{are a result of}} nonuniformities within the infrared focal plane detector array. The techniques presented dispense with the need for traditional temperature references, and provide nonuniformity compensation by using only the statistics of the moving infrared scene and motion of the camera assembly for calibration. Frame averaging is employed, assuming that all of the detector pixels will eventually be irradiated with the same levels of incident flux after some extended period of time. Using a statistical analysis of the camera image data, the correction coefficients are re-calculated and updated. These techniques also ensure that the calculated coefficients continually track the variations in the dark currents as well as temperature changes within the dewar sensor <b>cooling</b> <b>vessel.</b> These scene-based reference free approaches to the calculation of compensation coefficients in the infrared camera are shown to be successful in compensating for the effects of fixed pattern spatial noise...|$|E

40|$|A report proposes the {{development}} of a system to collect volatile elements and compounds from Lunar soil for use in supporting habitation and processing into rocket fuel. Prior exploratory missions revealed that H 2, He, and N 2 are present in Lunar soil and there are some indications that water ice may also be present. The proposed system would include a shroud that would be placed on the Lunar surface. Inside the shroud would be a radio antenna aimed downward. The antenna would be excited at a suitably high power and at a frequency chosen to optimize the depth of penetration of radio waves into the soil. The radio waves would heat the soil, thereby releasing volatiles bound to soil particles. The escaping volatiles would be retained by the shroud and collected by condensation in a radiatively <b>cooled</b> <b>vessel</b> connected to the shroud.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the volume of the liquid sample, the degree of {{turbulence}} in the liquid, and the rate of cooling upon the probability of nucleation has been studied for water and aqueous solutions. Nucleation rates were measured for droplets nearly instantaneously cooled to a predetermined temperature. Also threshold temperatures for nucleation were determined in stirred externally <b>cooled</b> <b>vessels.</b> The liquids studied (tap water, distilled water, and orange juice) did not contain particles causing nucleation at supercoolings less than 6 °C. Nucleation at smaller supercoolings is attributed to the nucleative action of surface irregularities of the vessel walls. Provided no air bubbles are dispersed in the liquid, the rate of stirring (degree of turbulence) appeared to have no influence upon the nucleation. The experimental results are inconsistent with the stochastic hypothesis of Bigg 7), the singular hypothesis of Langham and Mason 8) and the pseudo-singular hypothesis of Vali and Stansbury 10). They could, including those reported in literature 7, 8, 10) be explained by the assumption of three distinct probabilities of nucleation: namely, the probability per unit time that a particular particle can cause nucleation at equilibrium conditions; the probability per unit time that equilibrium is established; and the probability that a particle with characteristic properties is present in the sample...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Most methods for the determination of trace elements in organic matter require the sample to be brought into solution, which may be achieved by heating with strong oxidising agents such as concentrated mineral acids, to decompose the organic matrix sufficiently to render the sample soluble, whilst not necessarily achieving complete decomposition. The use of microwave heating for this purpose, using sealed vessels under pressure, was investigated {{for a variety of}} food samples. One drawback of this otherwise rapid method is the time taken to <b>cool</b> the <b>vessels</b> before opening. The use of liquid nitrogen to <b>cool</b> the <b>vessel</b> walls - before, during and after the heating cycle - was investigated, and its effect on the progress of the digestion was assessed. Another problem is the control of internal pressure, which can rise very rapidly when digesting samples of high organic content, and ways of controlling excess pressure when digesting larger samples were devised. These included the use of an open pre-digestion under reflux using a microwavetransparent coolant liquid, and the use of vessels capable of withstanding higher pressures. The latter proved more convenient as they enabled complete dissolution to be achieved in a single stage without pre-digestion, although <b>cooling</b> of these <b>vessels</b> was much slower than for the low pressure vessels, so overall sample preparation time was similar. Various methods were developed for the complete dissolution of the samples using nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. The degree of decomposition achieved for the different methods and sample types was monitored by measurement of residual carbon in the digests. A few samples were virtually completely decomposed with nitric acid alone, while the use of hydrogen peroxide, following a nitric acid digestion, was found to reduce residual carbon substantially in the others. The undecomposed material was analysed by various methods including ultraviolet/visible spectrometry, infrared spectrometry and thin layer chromatography. Decomposition products were found to include carboxylic acids, oxalates, phosphates, nitrates and nitro-aromatics. Complete decomposition of milk powder, which proved most resistant to oxidation, was achieved by further treatment with perchloric acid. This was found necessary for anodic stripping voltammetric analysis, which required the destruction of interfering organic species for accurate determination of trace elements, unlike other techniques such as inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, where complete decomposition was not required...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Radiofrequency {{ablation}} (RFA) is a clinically established {{minimally invasive}} therapy option for liver tumors. However, a high local recurrence rate due to the vascular cooling effect of nearby liver vessels limits its curative application. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the cooling effect of different vessel positions in multipolar radiofrequency ablation. Material and Methods: Radiofrequency ablation was performed in porcine livers ex vivo with three bipolar, internally cooled applicators, using a multipolar ablation mode and an applicator distance of 20 mm. In order to simulate a perfused vessel, a glass tube (3 mm inner diameter, 100 ml/min flow volume, H 20) was placed in the geometric applicator center, as well as eccentric in 2. 5 -mm-steps up to a distance of 10 mm to the applicator center. Additionally, a dry run without flow was performed with a centrally placed glass tube. The endpoint of each experiment was an energy application of 40 kJ. Thermolesions were digitally and planimetrically measured along the cross-section area at the level of the largest lesion diameter, orthogonally to the applicators. Results: 36 RFA with perfusion were performed. In contrast to the dry run, a macroscopic margin of unchanged tissue, located directly around the vessel was found in all experiments with perfusion (area in a 3 mm-sector around the vessel: 60 – 70 % vs. 0 % in the dry run; p 0. 05). Circular and closed lesions were obtained around centrally placed <b>cooling</b> <b>vessels.</b> Eccentrically placed vessels resulted in an opening of the lesion area close to the vessel with kidney-shaped lesions. A lesion area increase was measured at the lesion border in comparison to the dry run (up to 20. 9 %; p < 0. 01). Conclusion: Simulated liver vessels with a continuous blood flow cause a significant perivascular cooling effect in radiofrequency ablation, independent of applicator positioning. This can lead to incomplete tumor ablation in clinical practice. Open-surgical radiofrequency ablation with temporary blood flow occlusion can avoid cooling effects and should be considered for tumors close to intrahepatic vessels...|$|R
40|$|Pyrolysis {{is known}} to occur by {{decomposition}} processes followed by vapour phase reactions. The goal {{of this research is}} to develop a novel device to study the initial decomposition processes. For this, a novel wire-mesh reactor was constructed. A small sample (< 0. 1 g) was clamped between two meshes that were heated fast (up to 10 000 °C/s, ΔTmesh ± 35 °C) by an electrical current. The mesh/feedstock was placed inside a vacumized (P < 0. 3 mbar), liquid nitrogen <b>cooled</b> <b>vessel</b> (Twall < − 80 °C). These two last features were proven to result in a low vapour life time (< 15 – 25 ms versus ∼ 2 s in typical pyrolysis). The vapour residence time and temperature could be increased by increasing the pressure inside the reactor and by removing of the liquid nitrogen cooling. Reproducible results concerning yields (mass balance closures 90 – 110 wt%) and analysis were obtained (oil by SEC and NMR, gas by GC, char by FTIR). The yields and oil composition were changing with loading from 0. 05 g to 0. 1 g, despite the small sample amounts. Compared to more “conventional” pyrolysis processes, high oil yields (84 wt%), very low char yields (5 wt%) and low gas yields (8 wt%) were obtained. Using a high speed camera, movies were made and together with accompanying pressure profiles, it was possible to estimate the conversion rate. At 500 °C the conversion process was finished within 0. 8 s which is faster than previously reported in the literature. Especially an increase in gas yield (+ 14 wt%, mainly CO) was observed in absence of cooling (Pvac/No Cooling), while both the gas (+ 4 wt%) and char yield (+ 3 wt%) increased under atmospheric pressure (Patm/Cooling), all at the expense of oil yield. Compared to more “conventional” pyrolysis oil, the oil did contain: (i) heavier molecules and (ii) a sugar fraction...|$|R

Such a situation would be broken down first into a system, which in this case would include the entire surface of the body.

40|$|In-vessel {{retention}} (IVR) of core melt {{is a key}} {{severe accident}} management strategy adopted by some operating nuclear power plants and proposed for some advanced light water reactors (ALWRs). If there were inadequate cooling during a reactor accident, {{a significant amount of}} core material could become molten and relocate to the lower head of the reactor vessel, as happened in the Three Mile Island Unit 2 (TMI- 2) accident. If it is possible to ensure that the vessel head remains intact so that relocated core materials are retained within the vessel, the enhanced safety associated with these plants can reduce concerns about containment failure and associated risk. For example, the enhanced safety of the Westinghouse Advanced 600 MWe PWR (AP 600), which relied upon External Reactor <b>Vessel</b> <b>Cooling</b> (ERVC) for IVR, resulted in the U. S.
