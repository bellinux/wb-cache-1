50|$|Even though upwards social <b>comparisons</b> are {{the most}} common social <b>comparisons,</b> people do {{sometimes}} make downwards social <b>comparisons.</b> Downwards social <b>comparisons</b> involve comparing oneself to an individual perceived to be inferior to or less skilled than the self.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{multiple}} <b>comparisons</b> can disappear {{when viewed from}} a Bayesian perspective. We propose building multilevel models in the settings where multiple <b>comparisons</b> arise. These address the multiple <b>comparisons</b> problem and also yield more efficient estimates, especially in settings with low group-level variation, which is where multiple <b>comparisons</b> are a particular concern. Multilevel models perform partial pooling (shifting estimates toward each other), whereas classical procedures typically keep the centers of intervals stationary, adjusting for multiple <b>comparisons</b> by making the intervals wider (or, equivalently, adjusting the pvalues corresponding to intervals of fixed width). Multilevel estimates make <b>comparisons</b> more conservative, {{in the sense that}} intervals for <b>comparisons</b> are less likely to include zero; as a result, those <b>comparisons</b> that are made with confidence {{are more likely to be}} valid...|$|R
5000|$|People {{with high}} levels of CSE are prone to making social <b>comparisons</b> based on {{appearance}} [...] As a result, these individuals more than often feel diminished. Appearance Related Social <b>Comparisons</b> are <b>comparisons</b> of one's perceived appearance to the appearance of other people. Those who make social <b>comparisons</b> base their feelings of self-worth on meeting social standards and expectations. Appearance Related Social <b>Comparisons</b> can affect one's self-esteem in both positive and negative ways. On the positive side, appearance related social <b>comparisons</b> can help develop and maintain one's level of self worth. On the negative side, appearance related social <b>comparisons</b> can cause the decline of an individual's self worth and value. Women who measure their self-worth based on cultural standards may be affected more by social <b>comparisons,</b> particularly when they have a low Self perception of attractiveness.|$|R

40|$|This study investigates {{whether there}} are {{readability}} differences among leading principles of accounting textbooks. Seven financial accounting principles textbooks with a 2002 or later publishing date are reviewed. Readability scores are obtained using the following four readability evaluation methods: Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Index, Gunning’s Fog Index, and the SMOG procedure. Three sets of <b>comparisons</b> are made: overall readability <b>comparisons,</b> chapter <b>comparisons,</b> and topic <b>comparisons.</b> The Kruskal-Wallis test is used for multiple group <b>comparisons.</b> For significant differences, the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test with a Bonferroni adjustment for multiple <b>comparisons</b> is used in further <b>comparisons.</b> Results indicate significant differences for all three sets of <b>comparisons,</b> although the conservative Bonferroni adjustment substantially reduces the number of differences that are shown here and could even reduce textbook differences that were found in some previous studies. Evidence suggests that readability among textbooks varies, but readability within textbooks is generally consistent...|$|R

This paper proposes a methodology {{to reduce the number}} <b>comparisons</b> while still allowing complete redundancy.

At the end of stage 2 or thereafter, the user can terminate <b>comparisons.</b> Besides allowing fewer <b>comparisons,</b> ranking before comparing holds out promise to reduce coding errors and improve accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Since Tversky's (1977) seminal {{paper on}} {{asymmetric}} <b>comparisons</b> was published, <b>comparisons</b> of different options are generally {{believed to be}} directional. Interestingly, the asymmetry involved in <b>comparisons</b> has not been considered systematically for choices between different options. This paper argues that, in decision situations, one of the options serves as a dominant standard against which the others are evaluated, which results in asymmetric <b>comparisons</b> and, in turn, has important and systematic consequences for the choice process. This paper outlines which conditions should result in asymmetric <b>comparisons.</b> Taking existing models of asymmetric <b>comparisons</b> into account, a process model will be presented using {{the loss of a}} previously available choice option as an example...|$|R

40|$|We ask {{subjects}} {{to report their}} income relative to different refer-ence groups, such as fellow employees, other people in their profession, same age and same gender groups, friends, and neighbours. In addition subjects report how important to them is each of these <b>comparisons.</b> Using these data {{we are able to}} study how important income compar-isons are to subjective well-being, and which <b>comparisons</b> are relatively more important. We find substantial gender differences, with income <b>comparisons</b> being much better predictors of subjective well-being in men than in women. Work-related and same age <b>comparisons</b> are rel-atively most important, while <b>comparisons</b> with neighbours are least important. The perceived importance of income <b>comparisons</b> is uncor-related with actual importance. Subjects who judge <b>comparisons</b> to be important are, however, significantly less happy than subjects who see income <b>comparisons</b> as unimportant. The marginal effect of relative income on subjective well-being does not depend on whether a subject is below or above the reference group income. ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{analyzed}} social and dimensional <b>comparisons</b> simultaneously {{in order to}} consider their impact on students' academic self-concept (e. g., Chiu, 2012). Thereby, social <b>comparisons</b> refer to <b>comparisons</b> with the achievement level of students' classmates, whereas dimensional <b>comparisons</b> comprise <b>comparisons</b> between students' individual achievements across different domains. This paper analyzes whether both achievement <b>comparisons</b> influence students' subject-interest in mathematics and English (as a first foreign language). The analyses are based on N = 1390 German fifth and sixth grade {{students who participated in}} the BiKS- 8 - 14 longitudinal study. Using multi-level analyses, results indicate that students' competences influence their mathematical and English subject-interests, demonstrating the typical pattern of social and dimensional <b>comparisons.</b> Further, analyses reveal mediation effects by subject-specific grades and self-concepts. These findings also apply for the development of students' subject-interest from grade 5 to grade 6.
