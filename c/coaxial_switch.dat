40|$|A {{high-resolution}} rf detector {{has been}} developed {{in order to test}} a <b>coaxial</b> <b>switch</b> used in a beam-position monitor (BPM). The detector with a Digital Muti-Meter (DMM) has an rms resolution of the order of 10 - 6 in short time and a wide linear range of 50 dB. Though detected voltage depends on temperature, it can be compensated by measuring the detector temperature. The insertion loss and its stability of several types of switches were measured at 1. 0 GHz using the detector. The normalized positions are kept within 3 x 10 - 5, which corresponds to about 1. 0 m in a chamber of the KEKB. The detector is useful to evaluate the insertion loss of switches. 1. INTRODUCTION The beam position is obtained by processing signals from pick-up electrodes. There are two basic methods for the signal processing. One is a parallel process, where the signals are detected at the same time. The other is a multiplexed method, where the signals are multiplexed by a switch and detected by a commom detector.

40|$|Abstract- The {{electrical}} properties of many materials {{are closely related}} to their composition and to their moisture content in particular. For sensor development, characterising the response of a particular volume of material over a broad frequency range is desirable, since separate measurements could generate errors due to spatial variability. A coaxial probe has been designed for measurement of the permittivity of smooth and flat, solid or liquid samples over the frequency range from 1 Hz to 6 GHz. Although the probe is capable of a very wide frequency range, separate instruments are generally required, and here we focus on measurements above 1 MHz. We demonstrate measurements in the frequency domain using a vector network analyser, and in the time domain using a broadband oscilloscope. For switching, we employed a <b>coaxial</b> <b>switch</b> and demonstrate how that is included within the instrument calibration. Calibration of the probe used three references: an open circuit, short circuit (indium foil) and a reference liquid, ideally chosen for a permittivity {{similar to that of the}} sample. The sample complex permittivity was calculated by a numerical model which used as inputs, the measured reflection coefficient and physical measurements of the probe geometry...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The basic {{requirement}} for the BEPC beam position monitor is the measurement of the beam orbit with 0. 1 mm precision near the collision point. To improve the measurement accuracy, {{the response of the}} beam position monitor pickups was mapped in the laboratory before they were installed in the BEPC ring. The microcomputer-controlled test set consists of high frequency <b>coaxial</b> <b>switches</b> to select each pickup electrode, a movable antenna to simulate the beam, a signal source, a spectrum analyzer to measure the pickup signals, and analysis software. The signal source operates well below the- 3 dB cutoff frequency of the pickups (buttons). We believe that the low-frequency measurement yields the same information as the real beam. The button signals were clear. This calibration technique is satisfactory for BEPC operation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Blumlein pulsers {{are well}} suited devices for high voltage pulse {{generation}} {{in the range}} of nanoseconds or microseconds. They consist of pieces of transmission lines charged in parallel and discharged synchronously in series into the load by using a single switch. The main problems with this type of circuit are the presence of the shield cable impedance that contributes to the power loss of the device and the requirement of long lengths of lines for operation in the microsecond range. In view of that, this paper presents a construction method that minimizes these losses and reduces the generator size by using coaxial lines coiled up on cylindrical tubes. In particular, we report the construction of a 150 kV/ 300 A/ 1 µs Blumlein pulser that has been carried out in our laboratory, including a PSPICE simulation of the output pulse voltage of the generator.

40|$|A hole-patterned {{electrode}} {{liquid crystal}} (LC) lens with electrically <b>switching</b> <b>coaxial</b> bi-focus and single focus modes of tuning is demonstrated. The proposed LC lens mainly {{consists of a}} two LC layer (TLCL) structure with different thicknesses to achieve higher focusing power than the conventional hole-patterned electrode LC lens with the same aperture size. In the TLCL structure, one LC layer, doped with 3 wt % RM 257, was photopolymerized to achieve a fixed focusing power of 18. 5 Diopter. Due to polarization dependence in TLCL lenses, an additional 90 ° twisted nematic (TN) cell was used to change the incident polarization in order to switch lens functions on or off. As a result, a fixed focusing power of 18. 5 Diopter was achieved when voltages of 10 Vrms were applied to the 90 ° TN cell. In addition, the switching capabilities of the bi-focus and single focus modes were achieved when operating individually with applied voltages from 20 Vrms to 90 Vrms, and higher voltages of over 90 Vrms, respectively. The maximum focusing power in the fabricated TLCL lens is 30. 9 Diopter...|$|R
40|$|When {{switching}} times {{are no longer}} dominated by the plasma formation time, such as for photoconductive switching of high-voltage spark gaps, electrodynamic details of the switching process determine the rise time and pulse shape of the switched pulse. We show that the commonly used zero-dimensional lumped element and one-dimensional transmission line theory are no longer sufficient for optimizing such fast-switching devices, because important electromagnetic-field propagation in three dimensions is neglected. In order to improve {{the output of the}} photoconductively switched spark gap, we developed an optimization procedure for spark gap geometries based on full three-dimensional electrodynamic simulations. By monitoring the electromagnetic-field propagation in time, it will be shown that the initial electromagnetic-field disturbance in the gap reflects at the outer conductor and interferes with the initial field. The reflection and interference are essential for the shape of the output signal. We propose the following optimization procedure to improve the output of the photoconductively <b>switched</b> <b>coaxial</b> spark gap. Initially, the reflection and interference can be influenced by reshaping the inner conductor. The outer conductor can be used to fine-tune the system to get an output pulse with a sharp rising edge and no significant oscillations. We also present the optimal spark gap geometry that gives the best output signal at photoconductive switching...|$|R

The main reasons for the development in this application were environmental, low maintenance and exclusion of erratic firings. Two prototype switches have been made for a hold-off voltage of 12 kV. They consist each of a stack of four asymmetrical Fast High Current Thyristors together with capacitive over-voltage protections and resistive dividers. A specially designed trigger transformer allows the reuse of the original ignitron trigger unit without modification. The switches conduct a 46 µs half sine wave peak current of 25 kA at an initial rate of 2 kA/µs. Their losses are about 80 Joules per discharge at 12 kV. The minimum repetition rate is 5 seconds. The two switches have successfully operated for one year and the series is now under installation. A similar switch has been designed for the LHC beam extraction system to prevent erratic firings. It consists of 10 series connected asymmetrical FHCT’s and its total stray inductance is less than 150 nH. It has a hold-off voltage of 30 kV and switches a peak current of 20 kA in less than 2. 7 µs. The 10 : 1 trigger transformer has a 5 µH stray inductance, which allows, at 2 kV primary trigger voltage, a peak gate current o...|$|R
