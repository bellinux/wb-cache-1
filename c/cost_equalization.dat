The purpose of the Dutch risk {{equalization scheme}} is to prevent risk selection and to correct for predictable losses and gains for insurers. The objective {{of this paper is to}} explore the financial incentives for risk selection under the Dutch risk equalization scheme. We used a simulation model to estimate lifetime health care <b>costs</b> and risk <b>equalization</b> contributions for three cohorts (a smoking; an obese; and a healthy living cohort). Financial differences for the three cohorts were assessed by subtracting health care <b>costs</b> from risk <b>equalization</b> contributions. Even under an elaborate risk equalization system, the healthy living cohort was still most financially attractive for insurers. Smokers were somewhat less attractive, while the obese cohort was least attractive. Lifetime differences with healthy living individuals (revenues minus costs) were modest: € 4840 for obese individuals and € 1101 for smokers. Under a simple form of risk equalization these differences were higher, € 8542 and € 4620 respectively. Improvement of the risk equalization scheme reduced the gap between costs and revenues. Incentives for undesirable risk selection were reduced, but simultaneously incentives for health promotion were weakened. This highlights a new prevention paradox: improving the level playing field for health insurers will inevitably limit their incentives for promoting the health of their clients. Highlights ► Improved risk equalization is important to reduce incentives for risk selection by health insurers. ► We describe insurers' financial incentives for risk selection in relation to recent improvements in Dutch risk equalization. ► We estimated lifetime costs and benefits for Dutch health insurers for smoking, obese and healthy living individuals. ► Insurers can expect different health care <b>costs</b> and risk <b>equalization</b> revenues for healthy living, smoking and obese people. ► Healthy living individuals are only slightly more financially attractive for insurers than smoking and obese individuals.

The goal of this activity was to reduce the use of fuel in Alaskan villages by developing small, low-cost power generation applications. Because of the abundance of high-quality coal throughout Alaska, emphasis was placed on clean coal applications, but other energy sources, including geothermal, wind, hydro, and coalbed methane, were also considered. The use of indigenous energy sources would provide cheaper cleaner power, reduce the need for PCE (Power <b>Cost</b> <b>Equalization</b> program) subsidies, increase self-sufficiency, and retain hard currency in the state {{while at the same time}} creating jobs in the region. The introduction of economical, small power generation systems into Alaska by US equipment suppliers and technology developers aided by the EERC would create the opportunities for these companies to learn how to engineer, package, transport, finance, and operate small systems in remote locations.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2015 In rural Alaska, {{there are}} about 180 villages that run {{independent}} electrical power systems using diesel generator sets. A diesel engine generator loses fuel {{energy in the form}} of waste heat through the charge air cooler (after cooler), the jacket water cooler, friction, and exhaust. Diesel engine jacket water and exhaust account for about 20 % and 30 % of the total fuel energy, respectively. In previous studies it has been demonstrated that about 80 % of the heat present in jacket water and 50 % of the heat from exhaust gases can be recovered for useful purposes such as heating, power generation, refrigeration, and desalination. In this study, the diesel engine waste heat application selected was power generation using an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) heat engine. The basic principle of an ORC system {{is similar to that of}} the traditional steam Rankine cycle; the only difference is the working fluid. The working fluids generally used in an ORC are refrigerants, such as R 11, R 113, R 123, R 134 a, R 245 fa, and HFE- 7000. The working fluid in the ORC system under study is R 245 fa. A typical ORC consists of a pump, preheater, evaporator, expansion machine (expander), and condenser. The working fluid is pressurized through the pump and supplied to the preheater and evaporator, where it is heated by the heat source. The working fluid exits the evaporator as vapor or liquid/vapor. It expands in the expander, generating power. The low-pressure working fluid exiting the expansion machine is liquefied in the condenser by a cooling source, returned to the pump, and the cycle repeats. At the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) power plant, a lab experimental setup was designed: a hot water loop (heat source) and cold water loop (heat sink) for testing the 50 kW ORC power unit. Different diesel engine waste heat recovery conditions were simulated to study the unit's reliability and performance. After lab testing, the ORC system was installed permanently on a 2 MW Caterpillar diesel engine for jacket water heat recovery in Tok, Alaska, and tested further. These two tests provide for the goals of the present dissertation which are: (i) testing of a 50 kW ORC system for different heat source and heat sink supply conditions, (ii) develop guidelines on applying the present 50 kW ORC system for individual rural Alaska diesel gen-sets, (iii) develop empirical models for the screw expander, (iv) develop heat transfer correlations for single-phase and two-phase evaporation, and two-phase condensation for refrigerant R 245 fa in the preheater, evaporator and condenser, respectively, and (v) parametric modeling and validation of the present ORC system using the empirical correlations developed for a screw expander and R 245 fa in heat exchangers to predict the performance of the ORC system for individual diesel generator sets. The lab experimental data were used to plot performance maps for the power unit. These maps were plotted with respect to hot water supply temperature for different ORC parameters, such as heat input to power unit in evaporator and preheater, heat rejection by power unit in condenser, operating power output, payback period, and emissions. An example of how performance maps can be used is included in this dissertation. As detailed in this dissertation, the resulting lab experimental data were used to develop guidelines for independent diesel power plant personnel installing this ORC power unit. The factors influencing selection of a waste heat recovery application (heating or power) are also discussed. A procedure to find a match between the ORC system and any rural diesel generator set is presented. Based on annual electrical load information published in Power <b>Cost</b> <b>Equalization</b> data for individual villages, a list of villages where this ORC system could potentially be beneficial is included. During lab work at the UAF power plant, experimental data were also collected on the refrigerant side (R 245 fa) of the ORC system. Inlet and outlet pressures and temperatures of each component (evaporator, pump, and expander) of the ORC were measured. Two empirical models to predict screw expander power output were developed. The first model was based on polytropic work output, and the second was based on isentropic work output. Both models predicted screw expander power output within ± 10 % error limits. Experimental data pertaining to the preheater, evaporator, and condenser were used to develop R 245 fa heat transfer correlations for single-phase and two-phase evaporation and two-phase condensation in respective heat exchangers. For this study the preheater, evaporator, and condenser were brazed plate heat exchangers (BPHEs). For single-phase heat transfer in the preheater, a Dittus-Boelter type of correlation was developed for R 245 fa and hot water. For R 245 fa evaporation in the evaporator, two heat transfer correlations were proposed based on two-phase equation formats given in the literature. For condensation of R 245 fa in the condenser, one heat transfer correlation was proposed based on a format given in the literature. All the proposed heat transfer correlations were observed to have good agreement with experimental data. Finally, an ORC parametric model for predicting power unit performance (such as power output, heat input, and heat rejection) was developed using the screw expander model and proposed heat transfer correlations for R 245 fa in heat exchangers. The inputs for the parametric model are heating fluid supply conditions (flow rate and temperature) and cooling fluid supply conditions, generally the only information available in rural Alaska power plant locations. The developed ORC parametric model was validated using both lab experimental data and field installation data. Validation has shown that the ORC computation model is acceptable for predicting ORC performance for different individual diesel gen-sets...|$|E

This paper introduces carbon trading in the dispatching model, gives full consideration to the benefit or cost of carbon emission and introduces carbon emission in the dispatching model as a decision variable so as to achieve the unity of the economy and the environmental protection of the dispatching model. A low carbon economic dispatching model is established based on multiple objectives, such as the lowest thermal power generation cost, the lowest carbon trading cost and the lowest carbon capture power plant operation <b>cost.</b> Load <b>equalization,</b> output constraint of power unit, ramping constraint, spinning reserve constraint and carbon capture efficiency constraint should be taken into account in terms of constraint conditions.

With the carbon trading mechanism, carbon capture power plants with new technologies are able to give full play to the advantage of reducing carbon emission and wind curtailment so as to promote the development of the energy conservation and emission reduction technology and reduce the total cost of the dispatching system...|$|R

The analysis of its variability allows us to understand to what extent this sequence is different from one day to another. To measure the similarity between two activity sequences, the one-dimensional Sequential Alignment Method (SAM) is used to compute the Levenshtein distance between two sequences of activities by applying a dynamic programming algorithm [23, 24]. The method computes the least number of basic operations (deletion, insertion and substitution), necessary to equalize two sequences. The higher the distance between them is, the more different the two sequences are. For example, consider two activity sequences coded as two strings f = “acb” and g = “abcd”. The SAM method [24] measures the equalisation effort (Levenshtein distance) between f and g as minimum basic operations to transform the string from f to g, i.e. 1) “acb” → “abb” (substitution of “c” in f for “b”), 2) “abb” → "abc” (substitution of “b” in f for “c”), 3) “abc” → "abcd” (insertion of “d” in f). Hence the Levenshtein distance between f and g is 3. The SAM uses a comparison table (matrix) to compute the <b>equalization</b> <b>costs.</b> The one-dimensional SAM has been extended to a multidimensional SAM by taking into account the dependencies between different attributes of activity patterns (activity type, location and duration, beginning and ending time, travel mode; see [24]). However, this also makes the calculation of similarity more complex as mentioned by Schlich and Axhausen [26]. The choice of attributes and their scaling, categorizing and weighting still lack theoretical justification. Thus, a one-dimensional alignment method is applied to compare activity type sequences. The reader is referred to Joh et al. [23, 24] for a more detailed description.|$|R
