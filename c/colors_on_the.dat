On either side is a martlet, reminiscent of those on the ancestral crest of Bishop Fenwick.|$|E
25|$|The first colors {{chosen for}} the new club were white, azure blue and golden lemon as an homage to Concórdia Club. But the {{difficulty}} to fabricate the <b>colors</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> uniform during those times forced a board meeting {{a year after the}} club's foundation. Pelúcio Paul suggested switching the official colors to white and black. According to Paul, the color white represents peace and black represents nobility. It received wide approval from the club members and the president of Santos, Raymundo Marques, based the club on the new colors.|$|E
25|$|The Indios {{were named}} after the {{formerly}} named Cervecería India (now the Compañía Cervecera de Puerto Rico, or CCC), the local brewery, and its formal sponsor {{over most of the}} team's 75-year run) besides the fact that Mayagüez, located at the western coast of Puerto Rico, has a strong indigenous heritage, starting with the city's name (which is derived from the Taíno language). The team's colors are burgundy, red and gold, which at one time were the <b>colors</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> label of Cerveza India, the original flagship product of the brewery which promoted the team and served as base for its name.

25|$|On 25 September, Masséna {{defeated}} Korsakov in the Second Battle of Zurich. The French suffered 4,000 casualties but inflicted {{losses of}} 6,000 killed and wounded on the Russians. The French also seized 2,000 prisoners, 26 guns, 407 wagons and 10 <b>colors.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> same day, Soult launched a surprise crossing the Linth River and defeated Hotze who was killed. Soult's force sustained 1,100 casualties while capturing 3,500 Austrians and allied Swiss, 20 guns, 33 munition wagons, two colors and many supplies. By {{the end of}} the day, the Russians had been driven back into Zürich. When news arrived of Hotze's defeat and death, Korsakov panicked and ordered a retreat to the north the next day. Hotze's successor Franz Petrasch also abandoned the area between Lake Zurich and the Rhine.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} purpose of HSL and HSV and similar models, and their most common current application, is in color selection tools. At their simplest, some such color pickers provide three sliders, {{one for each}} attribute. Most, however, show a two-dimensional slice through the model, along with a slider controlling which particular slice is shown. The latter type of GUI exhibits great variety, because of the choice of cylinders, hexagonal prisms, or cones/bicones that the models suggest (see the diagram {{near the top of}} the page). Several color choosers from the 1990s are shown to the right, most of which have remained nearly unchanged in the intervening time: today, nearly every computer color chooser uses HSL or HSV, at least as an option. Some more sophisticated variants are designed for choosing whole sets of colors, basing their suggestions of compatible <b>colors</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> HSL or HSV relationships between them.|$|E
25|$|For much of 1863, the 1st Ohio was {{stationed}} in Tennessee and assigned to the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Division, XX Corps, Army of the Cumberland, until October when the IV Corps was formed from {{the remnants of the}} heavily depleted XX Corps and XXI Corps. Under the command of Maj. Joab A. Stafford, the regiment saw action at the Battle of Chickamauga, a stinging defeat for Rosecrans' army. It marched to Knoxville as part of the army relieving the Confederate siege of Union forces at that city. Yet another reorganization of the army resulted in the 1st OVI being assigned to the 2nd Brigade, 3rd Division, 4th Army Corps, Army of the Cumberland, until September 1864. It fought under Grant at Missionary Ridge, where the 1st OVI was the first regiment to plant its <b>colors</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hilltop, and with Sherman in the Atlanta campaign. The regiment spent {{much of the rest of}} the fall on scouting duty in Tennessee.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} scheme is a {{straight}} blue stripe across {{the sides of}} the bus against a white base, with no <b>colors</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front or back, and black window trim. From 1977 until late 2007, (and still present on much of the fleet), the livery was a full all-around stripe with a black rear, and until late 2010 (and still present on buses repainted during this time), the scheme was a stripe with a blank rear. Buses operated in Select Bus Service bus rapid transit service are wrapped with a light blue-and-white wrap below the windows. In spring 2016, a new livery was introduced based on navy blue, light blue, and gold, with a mostly blue front and sides, a light blue and gold wave, and a gold back. This new livery will gradually replace the blue stripe on a white base livery, and with the new livery's introduction, the only public distinction between MTA New York City Bus and MTA Bus will be the garage sticker.|$|E

500|$|In {{previous}} Halo games, {{sections of}} music overlap and change depending on player action. Reachs system of interactive audio {{was much more}} complex, featuring the ability to combine up to seven layers of instrumentation compared to [...] Combat Evolveds two. Developers also expanded the sound effect system. Every interacting object in Reach produces two sounds for respective objects; for example, a Warthog vehicle that hits an armored Covenant soldier produces a crunching metal noise based on the two colliding elements. The interaction between objects and terrain was demonstrated in an in-game environment that O'Donnell called [...] "the stripey room" [...] after the bands of alternating <b>colors</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> objects and environment.|$|E
500|$|The {{model for}} the shots wore all-white {{cosmetic}} makeup, along with a twill-coloured cape, to aesthetically produce optimal and desired results.

Martin eventually saw the image in a publication of the magazine, then approaching Sundsbø for proper permission to use the image as the cover of A Rush of Blood to the Head. For the album's singles, Martin asked Sundsbø for any ideas; Sundsbø suggested scanning the head of each member of the band (Sundsbø also did artwork duties for the Live 2003 album cover).|$|E

500|$|Mycena aurantiomarginata is {{generally}} recognizable {{in the field}} by its olive-brown to orangish cap, bright orange gill edges, and yellowish hairs {{at the base of}} the stipe. M.elegans is similar in appearance to M.aurantiomarginata, and some have considered them synonymous. M.elegans is larger, with a cap diameter up to [...] and stipe length up to , darker, and has pale greenish-yellow <b>colors</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gill edges and stipes that stain dull reddish-brown in age. M.leaiana is readily distinguished from M.aurantiomarginata by the bright orange color of its fruit bodies, its clustered growth on rotting wood, and the presence of a gelatinous layer on its stipe. M.strobilinoides closely resembles M.aurantiomarginata in shape, size, spore morphology, and the presence of hairs at the stipe base. It has a cap color that ranges from scarlet to yellow, and features scarlet edges on widely spaced, pale pinkish-orange to yellow gills.|$|E
500|$|The {{beautiful}} nuthatch (Sitta formosa, {{sometimes called}} Callisitta formosa) is a bird {{species in the}} Sittidae family, collectively known as nuthatches. It is a large nuthatch, measuring [...] in length, that is not sexually dimorphic. Its coloration and markings are dramatic, the upper parts being black and azure, streaked with white and pale blue {{on the head and}} lined with the same <b>colors</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wing feathers. The underparts are orange, and the eyebrow and throat are ochre. An irregular, dark eyestripe highlights its eye. S. formosas ecology is not fully described, but it is known to feed on small insects and larvae found on the trunks and epiphyte-covered branches of trees in its range. Reproduction takes place from April to May; the nest is placed in the hole of an oak, rhododendron, or other large tree. The nest is made of plant material and fur in which the bird typically lays four to six eggs.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to permanently adding the speed die in 2008, Hasbro also instituted further {{changes to the}} United States standard edition of the board, including making Mediterranean and Baltic Avenues a brown color group, making the Income Tax space a flat $200 (removing the 10% option), changing the <b>colors</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> GO space from red to black, increasing the Luxury Tax to $100 (from $75), and changing certain of the Community Chest and Chance cards. The changes in these four areas made the U.S. standard edition more uniform with the UK and modern European editions.
