5|$|In a dissenting opinion, a {{systematic}} review of four head-to-head comparative trials of metformin and <b>clomifene</b> found them equally effective for infertility. Four positive studies of metformin were in women not responding to <b>clomifene,</b> while {{the population in}} the negative studies was drug-naive or uncontrolled for the previous treatment. Metformin should be used as a second-line drug if <b>clomifene</b> treatment fails. Another review recommended metformin unreservedly as a first-line treatment option because it has positive effects not only on anovulation, but also on insulin resistance, hirsutism and obesity often associated with PCOS. A Cochrane Collaboration review found metformin improves ovulation and pregnancy rates, particularly when combined with <b>clomifene,</b> but is not associated with {{an increase in the number}} of live births.|$|E
5|$|Antidiabetic {{therapy has}} been {{proposed}} {{as a treatment for}} polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition frequently associated with insulin resistance, since the late 1980s. The use of metformin in PCOS was first reported in 1994, in a small study conducted at the University of the Andes, Venezuela. The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended in 2004 that women with PCOS and a body mass index above 25 be given metformin for anovulation and infertility when other therapies fail to produce results. However, two clinical studies completed in 2006–2007 returned mostly negative results, with metformin performing no better than placebo, and a metformin-clomifene combination no better than <b>clomifene</b> alone. Reflecting this, subsequent reviews large randomized controlled trials in general have not shown the promise suggested by the early studies. UK and international clinical practice guidelines do not recommend metformin as a first-line treatment or do not recommend it at all, except for women with glucose intolerance. The guidelines suggest clomiphene as the first medication option and emphasize lifestyle modification independently from the drug treatment.|$|E
25|$|Larger {{bilateral}} cysts {{can develop}} {{as a result}} of fertility treatment due to elevated levels of HCG, as can be seen with the use of <b>clomifene</b> for follicular induction, in extreme cases resulting in a condition known as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Certain malignancies can mimic the effects of <b>clomifene</b> on the ovaries, also due to increased HCG, in particular gestational trophoblastic disease. Ovarian hyperstimulation occurs more often with invasive moles and choriocarcinoma than complete molar pregnancies.|$|E
25|$|The risk of {{twin birth}} can vary {{depending}} on what types of fertility treatments are used. With in vitro fertilisation (IVF), this is primarily due to the insertion of multiple embryos into the uterus. Ovarian hyperstimulation without IVF has a very high risk of multiple birth. Reversal of anovulation with <b>clomifene</b> (trade names including Clomid) has a relatively less but yet significant risk of multiple pregnancy.|$|E

50|$|For {{both men}} and women, an {{alternative}} to testosterone replacement is low-dose <b>clomifene</b> treatment, which can stimulate the body to naturally increase hormone levels while avoiding infertility and other side effects that can result from direct hormone replacement therapy. This therapy has only been shown helpful for men with secondary hypogonadism. Recent studies have shown it can be safe and effective monotherapy for up to 2 years in patients with intact testicular function and impaired function of the HPTA(http://www.nature.com/ijir/journal/v15/n3/full/3900981a.html). <b>Clomifene</b> blocks estrogen from binding to some estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus, thereby causing an increased release gNRH and subsequently LH from the pituitary. <b>Clomifene</b> is a Selective Estrogen Reuptake Modulator (SERM).Generally <b>clomifene</b> does not have adverse effects at the doses used for this purpose. <b>Clomifene</b> at much higher doses is used to induce ovulation and has significant adverse effects in such a setting.|$|E

50|$|The {{discovery}} of SERMs resulted from attempts {{to develop new}} contraceptives. A timeline of when SERMs came on the market is seen in figure 1. <b>Clomifene</b> and tamoxifen prevented conception in rats but did the opposite in humans. <b>Clomifene</b> successfully induced ovulation in subfertile women and on February 1, 1967, it was approved in the US {{for the treatment of}} ovulatory dysfunction in women who were trying to conceive. Toxicological issues prevented long term use of <b>clomifene</b> and further drug development for other potential applications such as breast cancer treatment and prevention.|$|E
5000|$|The first drug, <b>clomifene</b> (2-4-(2-chloro-1,2-diphenylethenyl)phenoxy-N,N-diethylethanamine;2-hydroxy-1,2,3-propanetricarboxylate; {{see figure}} 6) has a chloro-substituent on the {{ethylene}} side chain which produces similar binding affinities as the later discovered drug tamoxifen. <b>Clomifene</b> {{is a mixture}} of estrogenic (cis-form) and antiestrogenic isomers (trans-form). [...] Cis and trans are defined in terms of the geometric relationships of the two unsubstituted phenyl rings. The two isomers of <b>clomifene</b> have different profiles, where the trans-form has activity more similar to tamoxifen while the cis-form behaves more like 17β-estradiol. Cis is approximately ten times more potent than trans. However, trans isomer is the most potent stimulator of epithelial cell hypertrophy since <b>clomifene</b> is antagonistic at low doses and agonistic at high doses. The antagonist isomers may cause inhibitory estrogenic effects in the uterus and mammary cancers, but the estrogenic isomer could combine with novel receptors to produce estrogen-like effects in bone.|$|E

50|$|<b>Clomifene</b> was {{studied for}} {{treatment}} {{and prevention of}} breast cancer, but issues with toxicity led to abandonment of this indication, as did the discovery of tamoxifen. Like the structurally related drug triparanol, <b>clomifene</b> is known to inhibit the enzyme 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase and increase circulating desmosterol levels, making it unfavorable for extended use in breast cancer due to risk of side effects like irreversible cataracts.|$|E
50|$|Enclomifene acts by antagonizing the {{estrogen}} receptor in the pituitary gland, {{which reduces}} negative feedback by estrogen on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, thereby increasing gonadotropin secretion and hence gonadal production of testosterone. It {{is one of}} the two stereoisomers of <b>clomifene,</b> which itself is a non-racemic mixture of 38% zuclomifene and 62% enclomifene. Enclomifene is the (E)-enantiomer of <b>clomifene,</b> while zuclomifene is the (Z)-enantiomer. Whereas zuclomifene is more estrogenic, enclomifene is more antiestrogenic. In accordance, unlike enclomifene, zuclomifene is antigonadotropic due to activation of the estrogen receptor and is able to reduce testosterone levels in men to near-castrate levels. As such, enantiopure enclomifene is more favorable than <b>clomifene</b> as a progonadotropin for the treatment of male hypogonadism.|$|E

50|$|<b>Clomifene</b> citrate (or clomid) is the {{medication}} {{which is most}} commonly used to treat anovulation. It is a selective estrogen-receptor modulator, affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis to respond {{as if there was}} an estrogen deficit in the body, in effect increasing the production of gonadotrophins. It is relatively easy and convenient to use. <b>Clomifene</b> appears to inhibit estrogen receptors in hypothalamus, thereby inhibiting negative feedback of estrogen on gonadotrophin production. It may also result in direct stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. It also has an effect on cervical mucus quality and uterine mucosa, which might affect sperm penetration and survival, hence its early administration during the menstrual cycle. <b>Clomifene</b> citrate is a very efficient ovulation inductor, and has a success rate of 67%. Nevertheless, it only has a 37% success rate in inducing pregnancy. This difference {{may be due to the}} anti-estrogenic effect which <b>clomifene</b> citrate has on the endometrium, cervical mucus, uterine blood flow, as well as the resulting decrease in the motility of the fallopian tubes and the maturation of the oocytes.|$|E

50|$|MER-25, {{a simple}} triphenylethanol derivative, {{is closely related}} {{structurally}} to the triphenylethylene (TPE) group of SERMs, which includes <b>clomifene</b> and tamoxifen. The drug, a derivative of the cholesterol-lowering agent triparanol (MER-29) (which itself {{was derived from the}} estrogen chlorotrianisene (also known as TACE)), was originally being studied in animals at Merrell Dow as a treatment for coronary artery disease. Its antiestrogen properties were discovered serendipitously when a young research endocrinologist at the company named Leonard Lerner, who was employed to study nonsteroidal estrogen pharmacology, noted the structural similarity of MER-25 to estrogenic TPE derivatives and decided to test it for estrogenicity, only to find that it blocked the effects of estrogen instead. Lerner subsequently went on {{to be involved in the}} discovery of <b>clomifene,</b> the first considerably antiestrogenic TPE derivative to be characterized. The structure of <b>clomifene</b> is similar to that of its predecessor, MER-25.|$|E
50|$|Therapeutically, <b>clomifene</b> {{is given}} {{early in the}} menstrual cycle. It is {{typically}} prescribed beginning on day 3 and continuing for 5 days. By that time, FSH level is rising steadily, causing development of a few follicles. Follicles in turn produce the estrogen, which circulates in serum. In the presence of <b>clomifene,</b> the body perceives {{a low level of}} estrogen, similar to day 22 in the previous cycle. Since estrogen can no longer effectively exert negative feedback on the hypothalamus, GnRH secretion becomes more rapidly pulsatile, which results in increased pituitary gonadotropin (FSH, LH) release. (It should be noted that more rapid, lower amplitude pulses of GnRH lead to increased LH/FSH secretion, while more irregular, larger amplitude pulses of GnRH leads to a decrease in the ratio of LH/FSH.) Increased FSH level causes growth of more ovarian follicles, and subsequently rupture of follicles resulting in ovulation. Ovulation occurs most often 6-7 days after a course of <b>clomifene.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{small number}} of underpowered {{randomized}} trials came to the result that use of <b>clomifene</b> in addition to gonadotropins results in similar live birth rate but with {{a reduction in the}} incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.

Such a protocol avails for using lower dosages of FSH-preparations, conferring lower costs per cycle, being particularly useful in cases where cost is a major limiting factor.|$|E
