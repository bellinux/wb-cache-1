The aim of this trial was to study the effect of the form of presentation (whole grain or flour) and the amount (40. 5, 56, or 100 %, depending on the form) of sorghum in the overfeeding diet on the performance of geese. During overfeeding, a diet mainly composed of sorghum reduced the FCR of the geese and increased the weight of fatty liver, but reduced their <b>commercial</b> <b>grading.</b> The use of sorghum during geese overfeeding offers interesting prospects for a more sustainable fatty liver production system. Indeed, it could reduce the environmental effect of goose feeding while improving the flexibility of production systems, making it possible to use a cereal other than maize for overfeeding...|$|E
40|$|Mango (Mangifera indica) is an important, {{and popular}} fruit in Bangladesh. However, the post-harvest {{processing}} {{of it is}} still mostly performed manually, a situation far from satisfactory, in terms of accuracy and throughput. To automate the grading of mangos (geometry and shape), we developed an image acquisition and processing system to extract projected area, perimeter, and roundness features. In this system, images were acquired using a XGA format color camera of 8 -bit gray levels using fluorescent lighting. An image processing algorithm based on region based global thresholding color binarization, combined with median filter and morphological analysis was developed to classify mangos into one of three mass grades such as large, medium, and small. This system achieved an accuracy of 97 % for projected area and Feret diameter, 79 % for perimeter, and 36 % for roundness. To achieve a finer grading, two different grading features {{could be used in}} sequence. The image grading system is simple and efficient and can be considered a suitable first stage to mechanizing the <b>commercial</b> <b>grading</b> of mangos in Bangladesh. Moreover, the method {{has the potential to be}} applied to other crops with suitable adjustments...|$|E

Here we report on the development of a static multispectral imaging system (MSI) that was used to validate the potential of the technique for high-speed <b>commercial</b> <b>grading.</b> The system consists of a high-performance CMOS camera, four lasers, electronically controlled shutters and a location control system. It captures four spectral scattering images on the fruit. In this study 100 ‘Royal Gala’ apples have been measured using the static MSI. The MSI measurements were applied on the intact apple and also on a flat surface of internal flesh exposed by removing a thick skin slice. The scattering profiles were fitted with a standard light diffusion model and a heuristic modified Lorentzian model. The results showed that the correlations between penetrometer firmness and model parameters were poor, with the correlation coefficient, R, ranging from 0. 4 to 0. 8 in the best circumstance of the flat surface measurements. Although multivariate models can improve the correlations, this work suggests that laser scattering information on its own is not sufficient to predict the firmness...|$|E

Kernel quality can be reduced by many factors but in South Africa the groundnut pod nematode, Ditylenchus africanus, is responsible for severe losses in groundnut crops. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate in microplots the effect of D. africanus on groundnut yield in terms of <b>commercial</b> <b>grading</b> principles. Differential initial population densities (Pi) of between zero to 7000 and zero to 20 000 nematodes per plant were inoculated, respectively, in two separate trials over two consecutive seasons. Significant non-linear relationships were recorded between Pi and nematode densities at harvest (Pf), between Pi and downgrading of kernels (% unsound, blemished and soiled (UBS)) and between % UBS and income earned per tonne. No relationships were found between initial or final nematode population densities and kernel fresh weight. Sufficient evidence was provided that damage by D. africanus on groundnut could be expressed in terms of commercial yield grading stipulations.

40|$|A {{strength}} grading process, starting with log grading, was studied {{with respect to}} grading yield, impact on quality, and economic efficiency when visual grades according to Nordic grading rules were used for alternate product comparison. Pine (Pinus sylvestris) and spruce (Picea abies) logs and boards were graded with several varieties of <b>commercial</b> <b>grading</b> and strength-grading equipment. The boards were destructively tested, and the European grade-determining properties strength, stiffness, and density were measured. Models for these were made by partial least squares and validated. A method for the derivation of settings for multiple indicating properties, which increased yield in some cases, was proposed and evaluated. Grading to grade combinations of C 40, C 30, and C 18 was done. The impact of visual override based on deformations was also studied. A simplified economic and sensitivity analysis was done. The outcome was that log grading {{can be used for}} {{strength grading}} with good economic and quality results. Strength pregrading on logs improves sawmill economy, depending on the species and market situation. Drying quality greatly influences the yield through visual override grading on deformations.

In order to investigate average daily weight gain (ADWG) in different space-allowance environments, some Italian Friesian calves were penned in three groups, called A, B and C, made up of 10, 12 and 15 calves respectively. Each pen measured 25 square meters. Calves were individually weighed on arrival at the farm, and once every forty five days thereon. Weight data were examined by analysis of variance (ANOVA).

The calculation {{of the amount of}} pork per capita available for consumption, was carried out in reference to the year 2013 in order to produce a methodology applicable also to different years by means of the calculation of appropriate conversion coefficients. The calculation of consumable meat in the reference year, was based on the quantity of meat derived from pigs slaughtered in Italy and the differential balance between domestic import and export of fresh pork, frozen and variously processed meat products.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{study the effects of}} {{incorporating}} sugar beet pulp (SBP) into the diet {{on the development of the}} crop and performance of geese. A total of 480 1 -day-old ganders were divided into three groups differing in the composition and mode of distribution of the diet offered from day 56 to 89. The following two diets were used: a standard diet (nitrogen-corrected apparent metabolizable energy, AME(n) 11. 44 MJ/kg; 160 g/kg CP) or a diet containing 10 % of SBP (SBP diet AME(n) 11. 47 MJ/kg; 160 g/kg CP). The swelling capacity (SC) hydration was higher for SBP than for the standard diet (3. 62 v. 2. 72 ml of H 2 O/g of dry matter at 60 min; P 0. 05). At day 89, the volume of the crop tended to be higher in the SBPt compared with the Control group (52. 8 v. 48. 8 ml/kg of LW; P = 0. 101).

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this project}} were to isolate and identify the non-starter lactobacilli in mature Cheddar cheese, identify strains which impart mature flavours to cheese and determine their role in developing cheese flavour. The main conclusions were as follows: Based on an analysis of 18 mature Cheddar cheeses, selected from 7 commercial manufacturers, non-starter lactic acid bacteria typically numbered, as expected, 106 - 108 per gram and were dominated (97 percent) by Lactobacillus paracasei. Although {{a small number of}} strains (typically 1 to 4) was found in each cheese there was considerable strain diversity in cheeses within as well as between manufacturing plants. When selected strains were investigated for survival and flavour enhancement when added (as starter adjuncts) with the normal starter cultures in Cheddar cheese manufacture, it was found that they remained dominant for up to 3 months of ripening. <b>Commercial</b> <b>grading</b> of these cheeses at 3 and 6 months confirmed that the added strains did modify flavour development and one (DPC 4103), in particular, had a beneficial effect. It was confirmed that two selected strains of non-starter lactobacilli were capable of metabolising citrate under the conditions of Cheddar cheese ripening and, consequently, if present in sufficient numbers, would influence flavour development. The work was greatly facilitated by the successful and novel adaptation of a modern rapid molecular technique (RAPD) for species and strain classification. In summary these studies found that one species of lactobacilli (Lb. paracasei) was the dominant non-starter lactic acid bacteria in mature Cheddar cheese. Although a wide variety of strains were identified, only a few were found in any particular cheese, suggesting their likely role in cheese flavour diversity even within the same manufacturing plant. This suggests the potential for flavour control or enhancement through the selective and controlled use of non-starter lactic acid bacteria. Preliminary investigations of the metabolism of those organisms supports this view and a follow-up study now in progress should provide greater clarity on this matter.

40|$|In a {{previous}} research project, carried {{out during the}} years 2006 - 2008, the possibility to manufacture wet glued laminated beams using ungraded laminations of Norway spruce side boards was investigated with very promising results. In the project presented in this report, {{the performance of the}} wet glued beams has been further investigated and developed as regards grading of side board laminations, bond line properties and lamination finger jointing. The possibility to use scanning equipment for measurement of fibre angles and prediction of strength and stiffness of boards and beams has been studied and the procedures for technical approval and CE marking have been probed into. Studies concerning market and economy for the beams and layouts for a pilot plant and a full capacity plant, respectively, for production of such beams have also been carried out. The possibility to grade side boards in the wet state using axial dynamic excitation was investigated with a positive result. From such excitation, a board’s stiffness (modulus of elasticity) could be determined. Accordingly, grading criteria regarding axial stiffness, and knot size, was applied to grade side board laminations into two classes; outer and inner laminations. Strength and stiffness tests of beams manufactured from such graded laminations showed that the beams actually could challenge first rate glulam and LVL products available on the market. Regarding beam shape and shape stability, cross section cupping may need further attention. Even if this deformation was small, it was still visible to the naked eye. The problem could probably be overcome if the beams are dried to a moisture content of 12 - 14 % before planing. Results of shear tests show that green glued bond lines can fulfil strength requirements for glulam. However, delamination requirements for service class 3 (outdoors) were not fully met. From small scale tensile testing of glued bonds it was concluded that green glued bonds with high density wood have the same tensile strength and fracture energy as dry glued bonds. For bonds with low density wood and/or small amount of adhesive, the tensile strength could be lower than for dry glued bonds, whereas the fracture energy was on a similar level. Strength testing of wet and dry glued finger joints demonstrated that joints glued from high density wood was significantly stronger than low density joints {{and that there was no}} significant difference between the strength of green glued joints and joints glued after drying. From X-ray measurement it was shown that the glue penetration into the wood fibres is much deeper in a green glued joint than in a joint that is glued in the dried state. From scanning algorithms developed within the scope of this project it is possible to obtain reasonably accurate predictions of grain-angle distributions on board surfaces as well as rather accurate descriptions of knot locations and of fibre-angle disturbances around knots. From scanning of board ends, cross section characteristics with respect to radial and tangential directions and of annual ring widths could also be determined. Finally, both board and beam stiffness were predicted from this data, with an accuracy that is comparable with the one obtained from well-reputed <b>commercial</b> <b>grading</b> systems...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} {{development of a new}} high-speed multispectral imaging (MSI) system compatible with a <b>commercial</b> <b>grading</b> line. The purpose of this system was to carry out spatially resolved spectroscopy to assess fruit firmness. Captured images were analysed using diffusion theory and modified Lorentzian models to extract a sample’s optical properties (absorption and reduced scattering coefficients) and optical parameters respectively. The high-speed MSI system was designed to capture images of fruit using a high-resolution complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor camera, 12. 5 mm lens, and discrete lasers operating at 685, 850, and 904 nm. Each laser illuminates a separate fruit, and the camera captures the interacting light with a single frame encompassing all three fruit. Depending on the size of each fruit the spatial resolution with the 12. 5 mm lens ranged from 0. 15 to 0. 22 mm/pixel. Initial measurements were made on 200 ‘Royal Gala’ apples to identify the relationships between the optical properties or parameters and either acoustic or the industry standard penetrometer firmness measurements. Performance of the high speed MSI system was poor compared to the results seen in the literature using alternative spatially resolved spectroscopic systems and other apple varieties. Only weak correlations (R = 0. 33) were found between the individual optical measurements and firmness. Unsatisfactory performance from the high-speed system {{led to the development of}} a static MSI system to measure stationary fruit and the development of an inverse adding-doubling (IAD) system to provide an independent measurement of the samples optical properties. The purpose of these systems was to help understand the measurement, reduce variability, and give an indication of the upper level of performance possible. The static MSI system featured a number of improvements including the addition of a 980 nm laser, the elimination of an asymmetry caused by laser polarisation, improved temperature control, an electronic shutter system, precise location control of the fruit, and a new 25 mm lens improving spatial resolution (0. 057 mm/pixel). A second study was carried out using the new MSI and IAD systems on 92 ‘Royal Gala’ apples. Fruit were sliced to expose a flat measurement surface eliminating variation caused by fruit curvature and skin pigments. With these refinements and simplifications the relationships between optical properties or parameters and penetrometer firmness strengthened. As fruit softened and penetrometer firmness fell the reduced scattering coefficient measured by both the IAD and MSI system increased with correlation coefficients ranging from - 0. 62 to - 0. 70. The absorption coefficients measured by the two systems showed the expected features related to the absorption of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments, and water absorption. As the fruit softened chlorophyll absorption decreased as the pigments are broken down and carotenoid absorption increased as new pigments are synthesised. No useful relationships were identified between the optical measurements and acoustic firmness. Multiple linear regression models were formed to predict penetrometer firmness using either the optical properties or modified Lorentzian parameters. The best performing model used a combination of the absorption and scattering coefficients, and had a correlation coefficient of 0. 8 and a standard error of 5. 87 N...|$|E
40|$|Machine {{strength}} grading is a production {{process in the}} sawmill industry used to grade sawn timber boards into different strength classes with specific characteristic values of the bending strength, modulus of elasticity (MOE) and density. These properties are called grade determining properties. Each of these is predicted {{on the basis of}} a statistical relationship between the property and a so-called indicating property (IP), which is based on non-destructively assessed board properties. In most cases, the prediction of strength is crucial for the grading. The majority of <b>commercial</b> <b>grading</b> machines rely on a statistical relationship of strength to an IP, which is either a global dynamic MOE or an averaged flatwise bending MOE measured over a board length of about one meter. The problem of today’s machine {{strength grading}} is that the accuracy of the strength prediction is rather poor with a coefficient of determination of about R 2 ≈ 0. 5 − 0. 6. One consequence of this is that much of the strength potential of timber is unused. The intention of this research is to contribute to a long-term goal, which is development of a method for prediction of bending strength that is more accurate than the methods available today. The research relies on three hypotheses. First, accurate prediction of bending strength can be achieved using an IP that is a localized MOE value (determined over a short length) that represents the lowest local bending stiffness of a board. Second, knowledge of the local bending stiffness with high resolution along a board’s longitudinal direction can be established on the basis of fibre direction within the board in combination with dynamic MOE. Third, fibre directions in the interior of a board can be determined by application of fibre angle models utilizing data of fibre directions on the board’s surfaces obtained from tracheid effect scanning.  Following these hypotheses, this work has included laboratory investigations of local material directions, and development of models for fibre directions of the interior of boards. The work also included application of one-dimensional (1 D)  analytical models and three-dimensional (3 D) finite element models of individual boards for the mechanical behaviour, analysis of mechanical response of boards based on experiments and based on the suggested models. Lastly, the suggested models were evaluated by comparisons of calculated and experimentally determined local bending stiffness along boards, and of predicted and experimentally determined bending strength. The research contributes with in-depth knowledge on local fibre directions close to knots, and detailed information on variation of the local bending stiffness in boards. Moreover, fibre angle models for fibre directions in the interior of boards are presented. By application of the fibre angle models in the 3 D model of the whole board, the local bending stiffness along timber boards can be determined over a very short length (l < 50 mm). A comparison with results determined on an experimental basis show a very close similarity implying that the applied models are sufficient to capture the variation of local bending stiffness, caused by knots and fibre distortions, with very high accuracy.  Furthermore, it is found that by means of IPs derived using the suggested models, bending strength can be predicted with high accuracy. For a timber sample comprising 402 boards, such IPs results in coefficient of determination as high as R 2 = 0. 73. However, using IPs based on the 3 D finite element model did not improve the R 2 value achieved when using the IPs based on the 1 D model...|$|E
