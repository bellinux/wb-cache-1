40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the ameliorative potential of Ocimum sanctum and its saponin rich fraction in chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain in rats. The chronic constriction injury was induced by placing four loose ligatures around the sciatic nerve, proximal to its trifurcation. The mechanical hyperalgesia, cold allodynia, paw heat hyperalgesia and <b>cold</b> <b>tail</b> hyperalgesia were assessed by performing the pinprick, acetone, hot plate and <b>cold</b> <b>tail</b> immersion tests, respectively. Biochemically, the tissue thio-barbituric acid reactive species, super-oxide anion content (markers of oxidative stress) and total calcium levels were measured. Chronic constriction injury was associated with the development of mechanical hyperalgesia, cold allodynia, heat and cold hyperalgesia along with an increase in oxidative stress and calcium levels. However, administration of Ocimum sanctum (100 and 200 mg/kg p. o.) and its saponin rich fraction (100 and 200 mg/kg p. o.) for 14 days significantly attenuated chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain as well as decrease the oxidative stress and calcium levels. It may be concluded that saponin rich fraction of Ocimum sanctum has ameliorative potential in attenuating painful neuropathic state, which may be attributed to a decrease in oxidative stress and calcium levels...|$|E
40|$|We analyse 20 th century {{trends in}} six indices for {{precipitation}} extremes and four indices for temperature extremes, calculated from daily observational data for European stations. The indices chosen reflect rather moderate extremes. Most of the ~ 80 stations used are situated {{in central and}} western Europe; therefore, results mainly refer to this region. Trends are calculated over 1901 - 99, 1921 - 99, 1901 - 50 and 1946 - 99. Two different trend estimators are used, and significance is assessed with a bootstrap technique. We find that: • Significant incr easing precipitation trends over the 20 th century dominate in winter for both average precipitation intensity and moderately strong events. Simultaneously, the length of dry spells generally increased insignificantly. • There are few significant trends of any sign for precipitation indices in summer, but there are insignificant drying trends over Scandinavia and wetting trends over central and western Europe for 1921 - 99. The length of dry spells in summer generally increased insignificantly. • Both the warm and cold tails of the temperature distribution in winter warmed over the entire 20 th century. Notably low values in the <b>cold</b> <b>tail</b> for daily Tmax and Tmin occurred in the early 1940 s, leading to strong but insignificant negative trends for 1901 - 50, whereas little change occurred before 1940. • Warming of winters during 1946 - 99 occurred in both the warm and cold tails for both Tmax and Tmin, with the largest warming in the <b>cold</b> <b>tail</b> for Tmin. • The warm tail of daily Tmin (and to a smaller extent Tmax) in summer warmed significantly during the past century. There is more evidence for summer warming {{in the first half}} of the century compared with the second half. • During 1946 - 99, the warm tail of daily Tmax in summer was generally warming while the <b>cold</b> <b>tail</b> was cooling (both insignificantly). • More digitized daily observational data from various European sub-regions are needed to permit a spatially more extensive analysis of changes in climate extremes over the last century...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the ameliorative potential of Ocimum sanctum and its saponin rich fraction in vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathic pain in rats. Peripheral neuropathy was induced in rats by administration of vincristine sulfate (50 μg/kg i. p.) for 10 consecutive days. The mechanical hyperalgesia, cold allodynia, paw heat hyperalgesia and <b>cold</b> <b>tail</b> hyperalgesia were assessed by performing the pinprick, acetone, hot plate and <b>cold</b> <b>tail</b> immersion tests, respectively. Biochemically, the tissue thio-barbituric acid reactive species (TBARS), super-oxide anion content (markers of oxidative stress) and total calcium levels were measured. Vincristine administration was associated with the development of mechanical hyperalgesia, cold allodynia, heat and cold hyperalgesia. Furthermore, vincristine administration was also associated with an increase in oxidative stress and calcium levels. However, administration of Ocimum sanctum (100 and 200 mg/kg p. o.) and its saponin rich fraction (100 and 200 mg/kg p. o.) for 14 days significantly attenuated vincristine-induced neuropathic pain along with decrease in oxidative stress and calcium levels. It may be concluded that Ocimum sanctum has ameliorative potential in attenuating chemotherapy induced-painful neuropathic state, which may be attributed to decrease in oxidative stress and calcium levels. Furthermore, saponin rich fraction of Ocimum sanctum may be responsible for its noted beneficial effect in neuropathic pain in rats. </p...|$|E

40|$|Changes in {{indices of}} climate {{extremes}} are studied {{on the basis}} of daily series of temperature and precipitation observations from 116 meteorological stations in central and south Asia. Averaged over all stations, the indices of temperature extremes indicate warming of both the <b>cold</b> <b>tail</b> and the warm tail of the distributions of daily minimum and maximum temperature between 1961 and 2000. For precipitation, most regional indices of wet extremes show little change in this period as a result of low spatial trend coherence with mixed positive and negative station trends. Relative to the changes in the total amounts, there is a slight indication of disproportionate changes in the precipitation extremes. Stations with near-complete data for the longer period of 1901 - 2000 suggest that the recent trends in extremes of minimum temperature are consistent with long-term trends, whereas the recent trends in extremes of maximum temperature are part of multidecadal climate variability...|$|E
40|$|Methodology is {{developed}} {{and applied to}} evaluate the characteristics of daily surface temperature distributions in a six-member regional climate model (RCM) hindcast experiment conducted {{as part of the}} North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP). A surface temperature dataset combining gridded station observations and reanalysis is employed as the primary reference. Temperature biases are documented across the distribution, focusing on the median and tails. Temperature variance is generally higher in the RCMs than reference, while skewness is reasonably simulated in winter over the entire domain and over the western United States and Canada in summer. Substantial differences in skewness exist over the southern and eastern portions of the domain in summer. Four examples with observed long-tailed probability distribution functions (PDFs) are selected for model comparison. Long <b>cold</b> <b>tails</b> in the winter are simulated with high fidelity for Seattle, Washington, and Chicago, Illinois. In summer, theRCMs are unable to capture the distribution width and long warm tails for the coastal location of Los Angeles, California, while long <b>cold</b> <b>tails</b> are poorly realized for Houston, Texas. The evaluation results are repeated using two additional reanalysis products adjusted by station observations and two standard reanalysis products {{to assess the impact of}} observational uncertainty. Results are robust when compared with those obtained using the adjusted reanalysis products as reference, while larger uncertainties are introduced when standard reanalysis is employed as reference. Model biases identified in this work will allow for further investigation into associated mechanisms and implications for future simulations of temperature extremes...|$|R

Extreme <b>cold</b> <b>tails</b> defined by the 10 % quantiles of temperature drop by a factor of 2 or 3, while the upper tails (beyond the 90 % quantile) exhibit a four- or five-fold increase in all seasons. Pressure shows contrasting behaviour, with increases in wintertime highs and summertime lows, while precipitation shows little change. On the basis of the observed datasets, temperature biases related to extremes of pressure or precipitation have been computed, as well as for joint combinations of precipitation and pressure extremes. The most dominant bias is associated with periods without rainfall, during which temperatures are at least 1 °C warmer than otherwise. Changes in the behaviour of joint combinations of extreme pressure and precipitation regimes also have a discernible influence on temperatures...|$|R

A study was therefore undertaken to compare the antinociceptive activity of morphine and paracetamol to that of mitragynine, a major constituent of fresh leaves of M. speciosa. The tests employed were acetic acid induced writhings, hot tail-flick and <b>cold</b> <b>tail</b> flick. All test drugs were administered orally to mice. Results indicated that mitragynine (200 mg/kg) and morphine (5 mg/kg) reduced writhings from 17. 5 ± 2. 8 per 5 min to 9. 6 ± 0. 6 and 7. 3 ± 0. 6, respectively. Paracetamol (100 mg/kg) did not significantly reduce writhings in mice. All three drugs produced significant analgesia when tested by the hot tail-flick producing peak maximum possible analgesia (MPA) of 35. 1 4. 8 % (morphine), 27. 8 ± 2. 1 % (paracetamol) and 42. 8 7. 2 % (mitragynine).

40|$|Cloud {{detection}} is {{a source}} of significant errors in retrieval of sea surface temperature (SST). We apply a Bayesian cloud detection scheme to 37 years of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Area Coverage (GAC) data, which is an important source of multi-decadal global SST information. The Bayesian scheme calculates a probability of clear-sky for each image pixel, conditional on the satellite observations and prior probablity. We compare the cloud detection performance to the operational Clouds from AVHRR Extended algorithm (CLAVR-x), as a measure of improvement from reduced cloud-related errors. To do this we use sea surface temperature differences between satellite retrievals and in-situ observations from drifting buoys and the Global Tropical Moored Buoy Array (GTMBA). The Bayesian scheme reduces the absolute difference between the mean and median SST biases and reduces the standard deviation of the SST differences by ~ 10 % for both daytime and nighttime retrievals. These reductions are indicative of removing cloud contaminated outliers in the distribution, as these fall only {{on one side of the}} distribution forming a <b>cold</b> <b>tail.</b> At a probability threshold of 0. 9 typically used to determine a binary cloud mask for SST retrieval, the Bayesian mask also reduces the robust standard deviation by ~ 5 - 10 % during the day, in comparison with the operational cloud mask. This shows an improvement in the central distribution of SST differences for daytime retrievals...|$|E
40|$|We {{employ a}} suite of {{regional}} climate models (RCMs) to assess future changes in summer (JJA) maximum temperature (Tmax) over the Ebro basin, the largest hydrological division in the Iberian Peninsula. Under the A 1 B emission scenario, future changes in both mean values and their corresponding time varying percentiles were examined by comparing the control period (1971 - 2000) with two future time slices: 2021 - 2050 and 2071 - 2100. Here, the rationale is to assess how lower/upper tails of temperature distributions will change {{in the future and}} whether these changes will be consistent with those of the mean. The model validation results demonstrate significant differences among the models in terms of their capability to representing the statistical characteristics (e. g., mean, skewness and asymmetry) of the observed climate. The results also indicate that the current substantial warming observed in the Ebro basin is expected to continue during the 21 st century, with more intense warming occurring at higher altitudes and in areas with greater distance from coastlines. All models suggest that the region will experience significant positive changes in both the cold and warm tails of temperature distributions. However, the results emphasize that future changes in the lower and upper tails of the summer Tmax distribution may not follow the same warming rate as the mean condition. In particular, the projected changes in the warm tail of the summer Tmax are shown to be significantly larger than changes in both mean values and the <b>cold</b> <b>tail,</b> especially {{at the end of the}} 21 st century. The finding suggests that much of the changes in the summer Tmax percentiles will be driven by a shift in the entire distribution of temperature rather than only changes in the central tendency.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the origin of}} extragalactic continuum emission {{and its relation to}} the stellar population of a recently discovered peculiar z= 3. 344 Lyman alpha emitter. Based on an analysis of the broad-band colors and morphology we find further support for the idea that the underlying galaxy is being fed by a large-scale (L > 35 kpc) accretion stream. Archival HST images show small scale (~ 5 kpc) tentacular filaments converging near a hot-spot of star-formation, possibly fueled by gas falling in along the filaments. The spectral energy distribution of the tentacles is broadly compatible with either (1) non-ionizing rest-frame far-UV continuum emission from stars formed in an 60 million-year-old starburst; (2) nebular 2 -photon-continuum radiation, arising from collisional excitation cooling, or (3) a recombination spectrum emitted by hydrogen fluorescing in response to ionizing radiation escaping from the galaxy. The latter possibility simultaneously accounts for the presence of asymmetric Lyman alpha emission from the large-scale gaseous filament and the nebular continuum in the smaller-scale tentacles as caused by the escape of ionizing radiation from the galaxy. Possible astrophysical explanations for the nature of the tentacles include: a galactic wind powered by the starburst; in-falling gas during <b>cold</b> accretion, or <b>tails</b> of interstellar medium dragged out of the galaxy by satellite halos that have plunged through the main halo. The possibility of detecting extragalactic 2 -photon continuum emission in space-based, broad-band images suggests a tool for studying the gaseous environment of high redshift galaxies at much greater spatial detail than possible with Lyman alpha or other resonance line emission.

Either energy or protein levels alone significantly affected most of the parameters of lamb performance, but their interaction effect was significant only for feed conversion ratio, <b>cold</b> carcass weight, <b>tail</b> weight, flap weight and back fat (subcutaneous fat) depth. The lowest level of energy (2. 3 Mcal ME per kg DM) resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} lamb performance as compared with other energy levels. Increasing energy concentration of the diet resulted in significant increases in fat percentage, but significantly decreased the moisture and protein content of the Longissimus dorsi muscle.

Disease lesions responsible for lung (pleurisy, pneumonia and abscess), heart (pericarditis) and liver (ascariasis) condemnation were recorded based on the decision of the veterinary inspector. Data on 3, 143 pigs from 61 batches were available. The relationship between disease lesions, tail lesion score and cold carcass weight was studied at individual carcass level, whereas the relationship between disease lesions and tail lesion score was studied at both carcass and batch level. Tail lesions (score ≥ 1) were found in 72 % of the study population, with 2. 3 % affected by severe tail lesions (scores ≥ 3). Pleurisy (13. 7 %) followed by pneumonia (10. 4 %) showed the highest prevalence, whereas the prevalence of ascariasis showed the greatest variation between batches (0 to 75 %). Tail lesion score, pleurisy, pleuropneumonia and pericarditis were associated with reductions in carcass cold weight (P ≤ 0. 05) ranging from 3 to 6. 6 kg. Tail lesion score was associated with condemnations for pleurisy, pneumonia and pleuropneumonia (P ≤ 0. 05) at a batch level. Veterinary inspector shift was associated with condemnations for pneumonia, pleuropneumonia and pericarditis (P ≤ 0. 05) at a carcass level and with pneumonia at a batch level. Sex was not associated with viscera condemnations but males were more likely to be affected by tail lesions. The relationship between overall tail lesion score and the lung diseases at batch level supports the relationship between poor health and poor welfare of pigs on farms.

The analysis {{is based on}} long-term, high-quality, and homogenous daily maximum and minimum temperature of 128 observatories spanning the period from 1960 to 2006. A total of 21 indices {{were used to assess}} changes in both the <b>cold</b> and hot <b>tails</b> of the daily temperature distributions. The presence of trends in temperature extremes was assessed by means of the Mann-Kendall test. However, the autocorrelation function (ACF) and a bootstrap methodology were used to account for the influence of serial correlation and cross-correlation on the trend assessment. In general, the observed changes are more prevalent in hot extremes than in cold extremes. This finding can largely be linked to the increase found in the mean maximum temperature during the last few decades. The results indicate {{a significant increase in the}} frequency and intensity of most of the hot temperature extremes. An increase in warm nights (TN 90 p: 3. 3 days decade&minus; 1 ), warm days (TX 90 p: 2. 7 days decade&minus; 1 ), tropical nights (TR 20 : 0. 6 days decade&minus; 1 ) and the annual high maximum temperature (TXx: 0. 27 °C decade&minus; 1 ) was detected in the 47 -yr period. In contrast, most of the indices related to cold temperature extremes (e. g. cold days (TX 10 p), cold nights (TN 10 p), very cold days (TN 1 p), and frost days (FD 0)) demonstrated a decreasing but statistically insignificant trend. Although there is no evidence of a long-term trend in cold extremes, significant interdecadal variations were noted. Almost no significant trends in temperature variability indices (e. g. diurnal temperature range (DTR) and growing season length (GSL)) are detected. Spatially, the coastal areas along the Mediterranean Sea and the Cantabrian Sea experienced stronger warming compared with mainland areas. Given that only few earlier studies analyzed observed changes in temperature extremes at fine spatial resolution across the Iberian Peninsula, the results of this work can improve our understanding of climatology of temperature extremes. Also, these findings can have different hydrological, ecological and agricultural implications (e. g. crop yields, energy consumption, land use planning and water resources management) ...|$|R
