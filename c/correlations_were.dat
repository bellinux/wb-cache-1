25|$|A small 2004 {{study by}} Ellen Paek empirically {{examined}} {{the extent to}} which religiosity, operationalized as religious orientation and religious behavior, is related to the controversial idea of emotional intelligence (EI). The study examined {{the extent to which}} religious orientation and behavior were related to self-reported EI in 148 church attending adult Christians. Non-religious individuals were not part of the study. The study found that the individuals' self-reported religious orientation was positively correlated with their perceiving themselves to have greater EI. While the number of religious group activities was positively associated with perceived EI, number of years of church attendance was unrelated. Significant positive <b>correlations</b> <b>were</b> also found between level of religious commitment and perceived EI. Thus, the Christian volunteers were more likely to consider themselves emotionally intelligent if they spent more time in group activities and had more commitment to their beliefs.|$|E
25|$|The {{lengths of}} the neumes were given values by adding up the {{duration}} {{values for the}} separate neume elements, each time following a particular hypothesis concerning the rhythm of Gregoriant chant. Both the syllable lengths and the neume lengths were also expressed {{in relation to the}} total duration of the syllables, resp. neumes for a word (contextual variables). Correlating the various word and neume variables, substantial <b>correlations</b> <b>were</b> found for the word variables 'accented syllable' and 'contextual syllable duration'. Moreover, it could be established that the multiple correlation (R) between the two types of variables reaches its maximum (R is about 0.80) if the neumatic elements are evaluated according to the following rules of duration: (a) neume elements that represent short notes in neumes consisting of at least two notes have duration values of 1 time; (b) neume elements that represent long notes in neumes consisting of at least two notes have duration values of 2 times; (c) neumes consisting of only one note are characterized by flexible duration values (with an average value of 2 times), which take over the duration values of the syllables to match.|$|E

Kim’s meta-analysis of 21 studies did not find any supporting evidence for TT, and instead negligible <b>correlations</b> <b>were</b> reported between intelligence, creativity, and divergent thinking both below and above IQ's of 120.

Mainwaring et al. wrote that Freedom House's index had [...] "two systematic biases: scores for leftist were tainted by political considerations, and changes in scores are sometimes driven by changes in their criteria rather than changes in real conditions". Nonetheless, when evaluated on Latin American countries yearly, Freedom House's index were strongly and positively correlated with the index of Adam Przeworski and with the index of the authors themselves: They evaluated Pearson's coefficient of linear correlation between their index and FreedomHouse's index, which was 0.82; among these indices and the two others studied, the <b>correlations</b> <b>were</b> all between 0.80 and 0.86.|$|E

2500|$|According to Schmidt and Hunter, [...] "for hiring {{employees}} without {{previous experience}} in the job the most valid predictor of future performance is general mental ability." [...] The validity of IQ {{as a predictor of}} job performance is above zero for all work studied to date, but varies with the type of job and across different studies, ranging from 0.2 to 0.6. The <b>correlations</b> <b>were</b> higher when the unreliability of measurement methods was controlled for. While IQ is more strongly correlated with reasoning and less so with motor function, IQ-test scores predict performance ratings in all occupations. That said, for highly qualified activities (research, management) low IQ scores {{are more likely to be}} a barrier to adequate performance, whereas for minimally-skilled activities, athletic strength (manual strength, speed, stamina, and coordination) are more likely to influence performance. The prevailing view among academics is that it is largely through the quicker acquisition of job-relevant knowledge that higher IQ mediates job performance. This view has been challenged by Byington & Felps (2010), who argued that [...] "the current applications of IQ-reflective tests allow individuals with high IQ scores to receive greater access to developmental resources, enabling them to acquire additional capabilities over time, and ultimately perform their jobs better." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper evaluates how {{to design}} {{procurement}} models when two agents may have better information than the principal about their production costs {{and about the}} similarity (i. e., correlation) of those costs between agents. The results indicate that if the uncertainty about the <b>correlation</b> <b>is</b> not severe, the principal should design a contract as if she knew that <b>correlation</b> <b>is</b> the lowest possible. The drawback with such mechanism is that the high-cost agent earns rent if <b>correlation</b> <b>is</b> high. In contrast, if the uncertainty about the <b>correlation</b> <b>is</b> more severe, the principal should not tailor the solution {{to any of the}} potential correlations. This contract reduces the rent of the high-cost agent if <b>correlation</b> <b>is</b> high by giving rent to the low-cost agent if <b>correlation</b> <b>is</b> low. Although the welfare level may be different, the characterization of the results holds when both agents observe the correlation and do not report it, {{as well as in the}} case where only one agent observes and reports the correlation to the principal. Finally, when the probability of the low-correlation setting is very small, the principal may find optimal to exclude the high-cost agent from the contract if <b>correlation</b> <b>is</b> low, allowing her to achieve the socially optimal situation if <b>correlation</b> <b>is</b> high...|$|R
