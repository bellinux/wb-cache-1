40|$|We {{study the}} factors that {{influence}} the cash allocation decision around a spin-off, using variables suggested by the trade-off theory, and controlling for the possible endogeneity of leverage and <b>cash</b> <b>ratios.</b> Spin-offs provide an opportunity to examine the determinants of cash allocation at the margin at the time of creation of a new entity. Our results indicate that managers allocate higher <b>cash</b> <b>ratios</b> to smaller firms, and firms with high research and development expense ratio, low net working capital ratio, and low leverage. Thus, higher <b>cash</b> <b>ratios</b> are correlated with difficulty of raising external capital and reduced availability of cash from internal sources. In addition, managers also base the cash allocation on observable immediate growth opportunities instead of on long-term possible growth. An analysis of excess <b>cash</b> <b>ratios,</b> defined as the difference between the actual and predicted <b>cash</b> <b>ratios,</b> indicate that firms are, on average, allocated less cash than suggested by trade-off models, and this deviation in allocated cash from predicted levels is explained only by concurrent profitability of the firms (a pecking order theory implication). ...|$|R

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of SFAS 95 in 1987, the cash flow statement became {{an integral part of}} financial reporting. With this a need arose for the development of ratios for the effective evaluation of the cash flow statement. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} determine the usefulness of the cash flow statement by means of <b>cash</b> flow <b>ratios.</b> Beaver (1966) was the first researcher to stress the importance of cash flow information for predicting financial failure and, therefore, the study investigated the available <b>cash</b> flow <b>ratios</b> of various authors. Eight <b>cash</b> flow <b>ratios</b> were suggested for inclusion in a financial analysis. Failed entities were selected and evaluated by means the selected <b>cash</b> flow <b>ratios</b> for five years prior to their failure. Non-failed entities were selected and included in the evaluation. The results of the ratios were used to calculate mean values for each ratio and year prior to failure. The ratios of the failed entities were compared with those of the non-failed entities. A comparison of the ratios revealed that the <b>cash</b> flow <b>ratios</b> have predictive value. The cash flow to total debt and ratio was identified as the ratio with the greatest potential to predict financial failure. The mean value of the ratio was weaker than the mean of the non-failed entities in four out of five years. The mean values of the <b>cash</b> flow <b>ratios</b> of the failed entities performed weaker overall than the non-failed entities. Failed entities not only have lower cash flows than non-failed entities but they also have smaller reserves of liquid assets. Therefore, they have less capacity to meet obligations and they tend to incur more debt. The ratios of the failed entities were also unstable. The study concluded that <b>cash</b> flow <b>ratios</b> calculated from the cash flow statement enhanced the usefulness of financial statements. A need, however, remains for consensus on a comprehensive set of <b>cash</b> flow <b>ratios</b> for financial analysis.
