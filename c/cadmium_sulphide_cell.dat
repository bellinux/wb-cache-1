It is generally accepted that this tissue is more selective than any other mammalian tissue currently used. The recently developed method of van Dongen & Hays (1966) for assaying oxytocin on rat mammary gland tissue in vitro is the most sensitive method so far devised. In this method {{the time of the}} beginning of milk expulsion is measured by means of microscopical observation of minute pieces of rat mammary gland. In our experience, however, the precision of this method is not suitable for quantitative measurements of relatively small changes of the oxytocin level in blood.

Bulk production of quantum dots using living cells has been attempted in microorganisms but very little has been investigated using plants. This research represents a step in that direction by utilising a novel system for the production of <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulphide</b> quantum dots. Hairy roots of tomato have been grown under conditions of exposure to cadmium with minimal toxicity effects on growth or the root biomass. Extraction and purification methods developed using another producing system, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, were adjusted for application to tomato hairy roots. Purified extracts of cadmium-treated tomato hairy roots exhibited strong fluorescence properties consistent with <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulphide</b> quantum dots reflecting crystal sizes as small as ~ 2 nm eluting with negatively-charged complexes of apparent molecular weight 1 &# 150; 3 kDa.

The low recovery of <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulphide</b> quantum dots from tomato hairy root cultures place challenges on their use as producers of bulk quantum dots; however, the strong emission properties of the produced quantum dots calls for the formulation of solutions and approaches to enhance the recovery of quantum dots from this system or other plant hairy root cultures...|$|R

The cadmium chloride annealing treatment is an essential step {{in the manufacture of}} efficient thin film CdTe solar cells. In previous work we have shown that the primary effect of the treatment is to remove high densities of stacking faults from the as-deposited material. Use of density functional theory has shown that some of the higher energy stacking faults are hole traps. Removal of these defects dramatically improves cell efficiency. In this study we focus on the effect of the activation treatment on the underlying n-type <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulphide</b> layer. A range of techniques has been used to observe the changes to the microstructure as well as the chemical and crystallographic changes as a function of treatment parameters. Electrical tests that link the device performance with the micro-structural properties of the cells have also been undertaken. Techniques used include High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) for subgrain analysis, EDX for chemical analysis and XPS and SIMS for composition-depth profiling.

40|$|The work is {{conveniently}} {{divided into}} two sections:- (i) the electrical properties of <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulphide</b> and (ii) the optical properties of <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulphide.</b> (i) Measurements have been made on thin pure platelets of <b>cadmium</b> <b>sulphide</b> from which {{it is clear that}} electrical conduction in these samples is governed by two complex defect centres with associated levels within the forbidden gap (0. 41 eV - 0. 61 eV; 0. 25 eV - 0. 83). This has been deduced from measurements of the static current- voltage curves made over a wide range of temperatures coupled with an investigation of thermally stimulated current curves obtained after electron injection and optical excitation. The measurements also demonstrate that Lamport theory of Space Charge Limited Current Flow in an insulator with traps is applicable at low current densities but that trap emptying occurs when high current densities are passed through a crystal. (ii) Measurements of the spectral distribution of ultra-violet stimulated fluorescence at 77 K and 300 K, demonstrate the existence of electronic energy levels within the forbidden gap which can be correlated with those determined from the electrical experiments. The spectral distribution of luminescent emission has been measured in pure and doped samples from which it is concluded that edge emission is associated with both sulphur vacancies and interstitials (0. 13 eV below the conduction band and 0. 16 eV above the valence band respectively.).
