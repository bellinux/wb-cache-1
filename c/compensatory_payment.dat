40|$|When {{negotiating}} agricultural policies, {{decisions are}} generally based on historical net farm income figures, which {{are derived from}} the then current price and production data. In 2003, when the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) {{was introduced in the}} EU, agricultural commodity prices were "low. " As a result the SPS is very generous when viewed in light of today's "high" agricultural commodities prices: farmers are double-dipping. We provide an empirical assessment of the implications for <b>compensatory</b> <b>payments</b> under the SPS in combination with high commodity prices for two major EU crops: wheat and barley. Yearly <b>compensatory</b> <b>payments</b> for these two crops alone exceed $ 10 billion. The lesson of this result for agricultural policy reform is that the payments under the SPS should have been made more flexible and tied to future (farm gate) prices, i. e., so payouts would usually vary with changing market conditions, while still being decoupled from production decisions.

50|$|Geoffrey Whitney, {{the eldest}} son of a father of the same name, was born in or about 1548 at Coole Pilate, a {{township}} in the parish of Acton, four miles from Nantwich in Cheshire, where his family had been settled on a small estate since 1388. Educated at the neighbouring school of Audlem, he afterwards proceeded to Oxford University, and then {{for a longer period}} to Magdalene College, Cambridge. He seems to have left the university without a degree, going on to legal studies in London, where he was addressed in a poem by his sister dated 1573. Having entered the legal profession, he became in time under-bailiff of Great Yarmouth, a post he held from at least 1580, retaining it until 1586. In 1584 the Earl of Leicester, high steward of the borough, made an unsuccessful attempt to procure the under-stewardship for Whitney but the place was bestowed on someone else the following year. After some litigation with the corporation, by which he seems to have been badly treated, the dispute was settled by a <b>compensatory</b> <b>payment.</b>|$|E
50|$|Surplus labour can be {{used instead}} of capital in the {{creation}} of new industrial investment projects, or it can be channeled into nascent industries, which are labour-intensive in their early stages. Such growth does not raise the value of the subsistence wage, because the supply of labor exceeds the demand at that wage, and rising production via improved labour techniques has the effect of lowering the capital coefficient.Although labour is assumed to be in surplus, it is mainly unskilled. This inhibits growth since technical progress necessary for growth requires skilled labor. But should there be a labor surplus and a modest capital, this bottleneck can be broken through the provision of training and education facilities.The utility of unlimited supplies of labour to growth objectives depends upon the amount of capital available at the same time. Should there be surplus labour, agriculture will derive no productive use from it, so a transfer to a non agriculture sector will be of mutual benefit. It provides jobs to the agrarian population and reduces the burden of population from land. Industry now obtains its labour. Labour must be encouraged to move to increase productivity in agriculture. To start such a movement, the capitalist sector will have to pay a <b>compensatory</b> <b>payment</b> determined by the wage rate that people can earn outside their present sector, plus a set of other amounts includes the cost of living in the new sector and changes in the level of profits in the existing sector. The margin capitalists may have to pay is as much as 30 per cent above the average subsistence wage, WW1 in figure which represents the capitalist sector is shown by N; OW is the industrial wage. Given the profit maximization assumption, employment of labor within the industrial sector is given by the point where marginal product is equal to the rate of wages, i.e. OM.|$|E

40|$|The European Monetary Union {{brought with}} it a {{standardization}} of monetary policy and a system of fixed exchange rates. This was accompanied by disincentive effects which, in turn, resulted in serious economic distortions. Proposals are currently being made - not only by DIW Berlin - as to how <b>compensatory</b> <b>payment</b> mechanisms {{could be used to}} better synchronize the economic development of the member states in the euro area in future. The present article discusses some of the problems of such transfer systems in detail and, on the whole, evaluates such mechanisms far more skeptically than the previous two articles in this issue. Comprehensive <b>compensatory</b> <b>payment</b> systems are always associated with a risk of resource wastage. Furthermore, these systems can also have undesirable negative effects. The alternative to a <b>compensatory</b> <b>payment</b> system, some form of common European unemployment insurance, is not a workable solution since national benefits already act as automatic stabilizers. Such a move would ultimately only lead to a transfer of competences to the supranational level. This would be accompanied by a harmonization of national unemployment benefit systems and the deferral of control functions to a neutral European authority - and thus, more red tape. Moreover, the introduction of a common unemployment insurance scheme would, at least initially, result in a significant redistribution of resources, which could raise questions about distribution in the donor countries...|$|E

40|$|As {{agricultural}} {{activities have}} the propensity to degrade water quality within a watershed, {{it is important}} {{to strike a balance between}} unchecked tilling of soil (and resultant non-point source pollution) and economic profits in order to maintain overall water quality. Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS) provide decision-makers with a computerized environment within which to model these trade-offs in order to ensure the acceptance of specific conservation policies by individuals. As an example, there has been a concerted effort to manage amount of soil erosion from agricultural fields through legal means in the state of Illinois, USA. However, compliance with the mandate to reduce soil erosion has been problematic because of negative impacts on a farmer's profitability. This paper describes the use of an SDSS to target <b>compensatory</b> <b>payments</b> towards reticent farmers in order to bring them into compliance by offsetting their economic losses. Further, this paper also describes the use of recent advances in Artificial Intelligence technology, in the form of "Intelligent Agents", to build improved models of human decision-making behavior that simulates acceptance of <b>compensatory</b> <b>payments</b> by farmers within the Cache River watershed of southern Illinois...|$|R
