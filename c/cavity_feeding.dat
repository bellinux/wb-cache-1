40|$|We {{compare the}} {{photoluminescence}} spectrum of an indium arsenide (InAs) quantum dot (QD) that is strongly coupled to a photonic crystal cavity under above band excitation (ABE) and quasi-resonant excitation (QRE). We show that off-resonant <b>cavity</b> <b>feeding,</b> which {{manifests itself in}} a bare cavity emission peak at the strong coupling point, is suppressed {{by as much as}} 40 % under QRE relative to ABE. We attribute this suppression to a reduced probability of QD charging because electrons and holes are created in pairs inside the QD. We investigate the pump power dependence of the <b>cavity</b> <b>feeding</b> and show that, below saturation, the ratio of the bare cavity emission to polariton emission for ABE is independent of pump power, while for QRE there is linear pump power dependence.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of the {{photoluminescence}} of a quantum (QD) dot in a nanocavity, with focus on the case of nonzero detuning. In this regime, experiments have shown that strong emission from the cavity-like peak is still present for dot-cavity detuning exceeding 10 meV, which seems puzzling. We will discuss the general theory of <b>cavity</b> <b>feeding,</b> due to the relaxation and recombination kinetics of a multiply excited QD. We first compute the multi-exciton manifolds using a configuration-interaction scheme, starting from a truncated single-particle basis. We then run Monte-Carlo paths of excitation-emission kinetics on these states. This allows to extract photoluminescence spectra and two-photon correlation curves. The agreement with experimental data[1, 2] is very good. Our result shows unambiguously that the <b>cavity</b> <b>feeding</b> mechanism at large detunings can be attributed to excited-state multiexciton radiative decay (mostly biexcitons), also involving states in the wetting layer continuum. 4 page(s...|$|E

40|$|The {{generation}} of photons in a microcavity coupled to a laser-driven quantum dot interacting with longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonons is {{studied in the}} regime of simultaneously strong driving and strong dot-cavity coupling. The stationary cavity photon number is found to depend in a non-trivial way on the detuning between the laser and the exciton transition in the dot. In particular, the maximal efficiency of the <b>cavity</b> <b>feeding</b> is obtained for detunings corresponding to transition energies between cavity-dressed states with excitation numbers larger than one. Phonons significantly enhance the <b>cavity</b> <b>feeding</b> at large detunings. In the strong-driving, strong-coupling limit, the photon statistics is highly non-Poissonian. While without phonons a double-peaked structure in the photon distribution is predicted, phonons make the photon statistics thermal-like with very high effective temperatures ∼ 10 ^ 5 K, even for low phonon temperatures ∼ 4 K. These results were obtained by numerical calculations where the driving, the dot-cavity coupling and the dot-phonon interactions {{are taken into account}} without approximations. This is achieved by a reformulation of an exact iterative path-integral scheme which is applicable for a large class of quantum-dissipative systems and which in our case reduces the numerical demands by 15 orders of magnitude.

This study encompasses the case of localized excitons embedded in a one, two or three-dimensional matrix. The populations evolutions are calculated based on a spin-boson model, using the non-interacting blip approximation (NIBA). We find that the single-photon spectral efficiency of the cavity-coupled emitter can be expressed by a simple formula, taking as inputs the free-space emission and absorption spectra of the emitter {{as well as the}} loss rates of the system. In other words, the information on the interaction between the exciton and the phonon bath, encoded in the free-space behavior of the emitter, is sufficient to obtain the dynamics of the system in the cavity. We compute numerically the spectral efficiency for several types of localized emitters and show distinct behaviors depending on the phonon bath dimensionality.

In this article, the study of microwave <b>cavities</b> <b>feeding</b> from two feasible designs to optimize is presented: feeding by means of rectangular waveguides and by means of slotted waveguides. The pursued goal is optimizing and obtaining a series of design parameters such as the position, orientation and dimension of the waveguides and slots in the microwave heating system, in order to maximize the system adaptation. A combination of these parameters constitutes an individual, which is evaluated by means of the commercial software Microwave Studio (CST). The simulation result are the scattering parameters associated to the individual. The population determines the number of individuals that conform each generation. From the initial population, operations of selection, mutation and recombination are performed, creating new generations that replace the formers.

40|$|We present detuning-dependent {{spectral}} and decay-rate measurements {{to study}} the difference between spectral and dynamical properties of single quantum dots embedded in micropillar and photonic-crystal cavities. For the micropillar cavity, the dynamics is well described by the dissipative Jaynes-Cummings model, while systematic deviations are observed for the emission spectra. The discrepancy for the spectra is attributed to coupling of other exciton lines to the cavity and interference of different propagation paths towards the detector of the fields emitted by the quantum dot. In contrast, quantitative information about the system can readily be extracted from the dynamical measurements. In the case of photonic crystal cavities we observe an anti crossing in the spectra when detuning a single quantum dot through resonance, which is the spectral signature of strong coupling. However, time-resolved measurements reveal that the actual coupling strength is significantly smaller than anticipated from the spectral measurements and that the quantum dot is rather weakly coupled to the cavity.

40|$|Electron-phonon {{coupling}} in semiconductor quantum dots plays {{a significant role}} in determining the optical properties of excited excitons, especially the spectral nature of emitted photons. This paper presents a comprehensive theory and analysis of emission spectra from artificial atoms or quantum dots coupled to structured photon reservoirs and acoustic phonons, when excited with incoherent pump fields. As specific examples of structured reservoirs, we chose a Lorentzian cavity and a coupled cavity waveguide, which are of current experimental interest. For the case of optical cavities, we directly compare and contrast the spectra from three distinct theoretical approaches to treat electron-phonon coupling, including a Markovian polaron master equation, a non-Markovian phonon correlation expansion technique and a semiclassical linear susceptibility approach, and we point out the limitations of these models. For the cavity-QED polaron master equation, we give closed form analytical solutions to the phonon-assisted scattering rates in the weak excitation approximation, fully accounting for temperature, cavity-exciton detuning and cavity dot coupling. We show explicitly why the semiclassical linear susceptibility approach fails to correctly account for phonon-mediated <b>cavity</b> <b>feeding.</b> For weakly coupled cavities, we calculate the optical spectra using a more general reservoir approach and explain its differences from the above approaches in the low Q limit of a Lorentzian cavity. We subsequently use this general reservoir to calculate the emission spectra from quantum dots coupled to slow-light photonic crystal waveguides, which demonstrate a number of striking photon-phonon coupling effects.

This work details and extends the theory used {{in a recent issue}} of Physical Review Letters (C. Roy and S. Hughes 2011 : Phys. Rev. Lett. 106 247403) to describe the QD Mollow triplet in the regime of semiconductor cavity-QED. Here we introduce two ME forms, Nakajima-Zwanzig (NZ) and time-convolutionless (TC), both to second order in the system [...] phonon-reservoir perturbation. In the polaron frame, these two ME forms are shown to yield equivalent population dynamics and fluorescence spectra for a continuous wave (cw) driving field. We also demonstrate that a Markov approximation is valid for computing the incoherent scattering processes and we subsequently exploit the Markovian TC ME to explore the resonance fluorescence spectra of an exciton-driven QD. Both cavity-emitted and exciton-emitted spectra are studied and these are found to have qualitatively different spectral features. Using a coherent driving field, the well known characteristics of the atomic Mollow triplet are shown to be considerably modified with electron [...] acoustic-phonon scattering and we highlight the key effects arising from both cavity coupling and electron-phonon coupling. Regimes of pronounced <b>cavity</b> <b>feeding</b> and anharmonic cavity-QED are exemplified, and we find that the cavity coupling depends sensitively on the exciton-cavity detuning and the temperature of the phonon bath.

All these flies have an obligate myiasis life-cycle, with a complete metamorphosis. The females lay eggs with high selectivity on their special hosts and at specific sites there. For example, eggs laid on the legs of horses in the case of species of Gasterophilus. The horse licks at the irritated skin and the larvae transfer to the mouth of horse.

40|$|Spiral antennas {{are capable}} of dual {{polarized}} operation if the currents can propagate along their arms by going either out or in through the radiation region of the spiral. The wrapping sense of the spiral determines the polarization of the radiated field resulting from this current flow. There {{are two ways to}} accomplish this phenomenon over very wide bandwidths. Specifically, either have a feed point for the spiral both outside and inside the radiation region, or use of the modulated arm width (MAW) spiral antenna. The MAW spiral antenna has not been widely accepted and is seldom reported in open literature. Its geometry is however sufficiently unique from the other planar frequency independent (FI) antennas to require a complete explanation of where it fits for different applications, specifically RF sensing. The design of the MAW spiral antenna is detailed herein including geometry described by modulation period, modulation magnitude, expansion rate, total number of arms, feed point structure, termination, <b>cavity,</b> <b>feeding</b> and dielectric effects. The emphasis is on detailed understanding of its performance characteristics such as impedance, pattern control and quality. The relevance of these characteristics to the antenna being used as a sensor is explained. The specific concerns being quantified are location by angle of arrival techniques and polarization detection. The use of a four-arm MAW spiral for angle of arrival as well as polarization sensing is demonstrated theoretically and experimentally. This combined capability has not been mentioned in any literature previously and was investigated thoroughly under this thesis to determine the limitations since as found herein no other four-arm FI planar antenna has this capability. In addition, the application of several geometries of the MAW spiral are examined as possible improvements over the original equiangular geometry including Archimedean, bi-layer, and structures that are not self-complementary due to either the modulation ratio or the period. In particular, pattern performance improvement is demonstrated for modulation periods that do not produce self-complementary geometries while having minimal impact on impedance. Finally, an investigation into the asymmetric modes for an arbitrary number of arms was conducted to evaluate the performance limits of the highest available mode (mode with the largest phase change between arms) of a MAW spiral. Typically, this highest mode has significantly poorer performance than the other modes due to the inability of the MAW spiral to separate it from the modes that are not controlled by the beamformer...|$|E
