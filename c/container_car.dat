25|$|Double-stacked rail transport, where {{containers}} {{are stacked}} two high on railway cars, {{was introduced in}} the United States. The concept was developed by Sea-Land and the Southern Pacific railroad. The first standalone double-stack <b>container</b> <b>car</b> (or single-unit 40-ft COFC well car) was delivered in July 1977. The 5-unit well car, the industry standard, appeared {{for the first time in}} 1981. Initially, these double-stack railway cars were deployed in regular train service. Ever since American President Lines initiated in 1984 a dedicated double-stack container train service between Los Angeles and Chicago, transport volumes increased rapidly.|$|E

50|$|Containers have weight limits {{designed}} to fit road trucks, which have clearly smaller weight limits than trains. A common limit for railways is 8 t per meter train length and 22.5 t per axle. A four axle <b>container</b> <b>car</b> can take 90 t. Since a container is limited to 30.5 t (plus a rail car), single stacking clearly does not use the load capacity of the railway. A 20 ft container is limited to 24 t and two such can fit into a car for a 40 ft container, or even three if double-stacking, but not four unless very high axle load is permitted. The North American railways permit two 53 ft or four 20 ft containers {{as shown in the}} images on this page.|$|E
40|$|Key words: moving model test; <b>container</b> <b>car,</b> {{pressure}} oscillation in tunnel; micro pressure wave Abstract: This paper describes the moving scaled-model test of express <b>container</b> <b>car</b> {{passing through a}} tunnel on moving model rig where its scale is 1 / 17. 6 {{and the length of}} the tunnel is 888. 8 m and the section area of the tunnel is 80 square meter and the interval of two truck is 4. 4 m in full-scaled model. The tests include that the <b>container</b> <b>car</b> passing though a tunnel with its speed are 120, 140, 160 and 176 km/h separately and its lowest Renolds number 51059. 4 eR ×= ′. The results show that the figure of the pressure wave on the car body is almost the same when train is in tunnel with different speed and that the amplitude of the pressure wave is proportion to the square of the train speed. The pressure on the car is always negative when train is in tunnel while the pressure on the wall of tunnel alternate between positive and negative. The coefficient of pressure wave on the car body is- 0. 7 and the peak values of pressure coefficient of point on tunnel are 0. 6 and- 0. 7. The amplitude of the pressure wave on the car decreases according to logarithmic law nearly. The amplitude of the micro pressure wave is proportion to the cubic of the car speed...|$|E

50|$|Cargolink has a {{fleet of}} five shunters at their port in Drammen, in {{addition}} to three Di 6 diesel locomotives and three TRAXX electric locomotives for main haulage. While the shunters are owned by Cargolink, the diesel locomotives are leased from Dispolok of Germany and the electric locomotives are leased from Hector Rail. It also has more than 100 closed autoracks for automobile transport, and 60 <b>container</b> <b>cars.</b> 70 new autoracks are under delivery from Sweden.|$|R
50|$|Another {{consideration}} is the maximum {{weight of a}} train. A maximum length train in Europe, 750 m long can have 50 <b>container</b> <b>cars</b> with a total weight of 2250 t, and more if 20 ft containers are included. This is not {{so far from the}} limit using standard European couplers. Double-stacking requires allowing higher train weight to be meaningful, since it is higher train weights that saves costs. In the U.S., the AAR coupler used allows much higher train weight.|$|R
50|$|The PPR Port Perry Bridge is a {{truss bridge}} {{that carries the}} Norfolk Southern Railway across the Monongahela River between the Pennsylvania towns of North Versailles Township, and Duquesne. The bridge was built to serve the Pennsylvania Railroad, to provide better access to {{industrial}} sites, and to help through trains bypass downtown Pittsburgh. Today, the bridge and corresponding route serve a similar purpose and are used to allow high-level loads, especially double-stacked <b>container</b> <b>cars,</b> to avoid the narrower routes through Pittsburgh.|$|R
2500|$|In North America, {{containers}} {{are often}} shipped by rail in <b>container</b> well <b>cars.</b> These cars resemble flatcars but the newer ones have a container-sized depression, or well, {{in the middle}} (between the bogies or [...] "trucks") of the car. This depression allows for sufficient clearance to allow two containers to be loaded in the car in a [...] "double stack" [...] arrangement. The newer <b>container</b> <b>cars</b> also are specifically built as a small articulated [...] "unit", most commonly in components of three or five, whereby two components are connected by a single bogie as opposed to two bogies, one on each car. Double stacking is also used in parts of Australia. On some older railways, particularly in the United Kingdom, the use of well cars is necessary to carry single stacked large containers within the loading gauge.|$|R

50|$|The Shelton Subdivision {{stretches}} from Elma, Washington to Shelton, Washington and is approximately 26 miles in length. The primary commodities on the Shelton Sub are lumber, garbage, and propane gas cars. The loaded lumber {{comes from the}} Simpson Timber Railroad, {{which is part of}} the Simpson Investment Company empire. Garbage comes from the Kitsap County, Washington Waste Management landfill located in Belfair, Washington. The garbage is loaded into <b>container</b> <b>cars</b> and is shipped via rail to a landfill in Arlington, Oregon. Propane is heavily used by Kitsap County, Washington residents in the fall, winter, and spring months and comes in via rail for destinations in Shelton, Washington, Belfair, Washington, and Bremerton, Washington.|$|R
2500|$|During the {{environmental}} assessment, existing rail infrastructure was surveyed for compatibility with a Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel. Parts {{of the existing}} trackage need repair. Some rights of way {{have been reduced to}} single-track width or were never wider and are in deteriorating condition due to their little use and maintenance. Nearly all track segments lack enough clearance above the tracks for the envisaged double-stacked <b>container</b> <b>cars.</b> Such factors limit the effective capacity of a rail tunnel and will add substantial cost to overcome. Rail yards east of New York Harbor lack a trans-shipment terminal with enough capacity to transfer the freight coming through a Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel to trucks. A proposal was generated to acquire [...] of land to build one in West Maspeth, Queens.|$|R
50|$|The primary imports are {{crude oil}} (20 million tonnes in 2013), {{textiles}} and food. The primary exports are new vehicles (trucks, cars, buses, heavy plant), steel and paper.

Long distance freight trains are put together in this yard, largely consisting of <b>container</b> <b>cars</b> and automobile transports loaded from the nearby Port of Richmond. The 24-hour operations of the switch engines are a constant feature {{of life in the}} Point. Residents have a love-hate relationship with the trains, pushing the railroad to modify operations to make them quieter and less disruptive to traffic but also fighting to save the wig wag signals when BNSF made plans to remove them.
