40|$|Abstract—This Screw {{conveyors}} {{are widely}} used for transporting and / or elevating particulates at controlled and steady rates. They are used in many bulk material applications in industries commonly agriculture, chemicals, plastics, cement, food processing. They are also used for metering (measuring the flow rates) from storage bins and adding small controlled amount of trace materials or powder. Many studies on screw conveyors were conducted to examine the performance and to develop new types. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to study the effect of percent trough load upon the horizontal screw conveyor power requirement and also gives the idea about selection of conveyor speed and diameter of screw. After considering previous papers it is noticed that percent trough load is a one parameter which is not considered effectively and it is discussed in this paper by taking examples.

50|$|A Tubular Gallery {{is a large}} diameter, round, {{tubular steel}} {{structure}} used to enclose a <b>troughed</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt. It is typically an elevated structure used to span over roadways, rivers or creeks or for use in shiploader systems.|$|R
50|$|The coal used by {{the station}} was usually shipped from the Yorkshire and Northumberland areas and {{offloaded}} by crane onto a deep <b>trough</b> <b>conveyor.</b> At its peak the station was burning over 1000 tons of coal a day.|$|R
50|$|Their type H.T-1 {{mechanical}} stokers {{were capable}} of delivering 15000 lb of coal per hour, which ensured a high firing rate when required. The stoker was driven by a totally enclosed double-acting two-cylinder variable-speed reversing steam engine, located on the hind pivot casting and operated from the cab. The coal bunker on the rear engine unit's frame was designed with sloping sides to allow the coal to gravitate to the mechanical stoker's <b>conveyor</b> screw <b>trough,</b> which extended {{the full length of}} the bunker.|$|R
40|$|Issue: One of {{the most}} common {{contaminants}} of recovered wood waste supplies is ferrous metal. One can find ferrous metal within crates, pallets, construction and demolition debris as nails, screws, staples and other hardware. Larger pieces such as scrap metal can also be found within the wood waste supply. Other sources of metal contaminant include damaged parts from the processing equipment (for example, sections of chain, bolts, and tools). Metal contaminants create problems for processing equipment. For example, chippers are sensitive to even the smallest pieces of metal. Even the sturdiest hog can receive serious damage from a piece of metal. Most importantly, to safeguard against damage to the equipment, detect ferrous metals at the in-feed of certain critical pieces of process equipment, like sizereduction equipment. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends wood waste processors install a metal detection system upstream of sensitive or critical process equipment. Generally, metal detection equipment is installed in a conveyor system. The basic equipment consists of a section of metal free <b>conveyor</b> <b>trough,</b> usually fiberglass, that contains a metal detecting coil. The detector is activated by the presence of magnetic or non-magnetic metal in the material flow. Any metal passing over the coil produces an electronic signal that activates an alarm system. The alarm usually sets off a warnin...|$|R
40|$|Pouch {{conveyor}} systems typically employ point-contact drives {{in order to}} generate traction. Differing from <b>troughed</b> <b>conveyors</b> which wrap the belt around a large drive pulley under high tension, point contact drives transmit force through load or indentation based contacts. This research focusses on quantifying the attainable drive traction for various surface configurations, including flat, concave and convex belts indented by cylindrical or spherical drive wheels. A viscoelastic contact under shear induces regions of stick and slip. Using this, the traction generated from each zone is superimposed to estimate the traction within the whole contact. These values are subsequently compared with experimental data indenting a cylindrical idler into a flat belt surface...|$|R
40|$|A <b>trough</b> chain <b>conveyor</b> has a <b>trough</b> (3) {{consisting}} of a base (16) and side walls (17, 18) and a conveyor chain (15) moving in said trough provided with scraper flights (29, 30). To increase the conveying capacity of such <b>trough</b> chain <b>conveyors,</b> {{it is intended to}} extend the cross-section of the trough (3) continuously upward so it can have a trapezoidal shape. At least the outer contour of the scraper flights (29, 30) are partially adapted to the base (16) and the side walls (17, 18) of the trough (3). If an intermediate base (4) is present, the inner contour of the scraper flights (29, 30) and the cross-section of the intermediate base (4) are adapted to each other...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{incorporation}} of conveyor systems throughout industry has seen {{an increase in}} demand for systems that exceed the specification of conventional conveyors. This coupled with the demand to convey bulk materials over larger distances, at higher speeds and efficiencies, requires {{the development of a}} versatile design approach. This thesis explores the design aspects associated with modern pouch conveying systems, and how they vary, and can be adapted from theories used with conventional <b>troughed</b> <b>conveyors.</b> In particular, the indentation rolling resistance (IRR) is explored in detail, as this can account for up to 60 % of the drag forces of a system. This is the drag force that arises due to an asymmetric pressure distribution as the idler roll shell indents the bottom cover of the belt. The potential idler roll arrangements for a generic pouch conveying system are analysed, and compared with experimental values. In addition to this, the drive traction attainable from suitable drive stations is analysed. <b>Troughed</b> <b>conveyors</b> typically wrap the conveyor belt around a large drive pulley, generating large amounts of traction. Given the layout of pouch conveying systems, a different approach is required, at multiple locations. As such, pouch conveyors are typically driven through simply supported drive stations, with small areas of contact with the belt. The useable traction from these point contact drives is considered. These theories are then united and applied to a dynamic package capable of handling multiple conveyor designs. This package utilises Finite Element Modelling (FEM) to model the viscoelastic nature of the system, based on the distributed drag forces, and inputs of the conveyor. Lastly, to qualify this theory, experimental analysis is conducted on an on-site installation, and compared with the theoretical results...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} from June 2014 to May 2015 at Penn State University’s greenhouse facilities {{in order to}} understand the production capacities and financial viability of an innovative growing system referred to as the Rotating Living Wall produced by GreenTowers, a student in-novation/entrepreneurship team. The system is a six-foot vertical <b>conveyor</b> that rotates <b>troughs</b> of microgreen plants to achieve even distribution of sunlight as well as relatively low maintenance within a minimal square foot area. Experiments {{were performed}} to understand differences in seasonal yields, differences in yields based on variety of microgreen, yield comparison to a tradi-tionally grown microgreen control group; both on a yields per/trough method as well as a yields per/ft. 2 method, rotational timing, moving versus stationary growth, differences in growth based on media depth, and differences in production yields from supplemental lighting. Performance criteria were based on measuring fresh weight, dry weight, height, and SPAD-meter readings (soil plant analysis development). Differences in yields throughout seasons were significant as well as differences between the Rotating Living Wall systems compared to a control group of traditional static greenhouse benches. The use of LED supplemental lighting provided significant difference...|$|R
40|$|As {{electricity}} prices continue to rise, the increasing need for energy management requires {{better understanding of}} models for energy-consuming applications, such as conveyor belts. Conveyor belts are used {{in a wide range}} of industries, including power generation, mining and mineral processing. Conveyor technological advances are leading to increasingly long conveyor belts being commissioned. Thus, the energy consumption of each individual belt conveyor unit is becoming increasingly significant. This paper proposes a generic energy model for belt <b>conveyors</b> with long <b>troughed</b> belts. The model has a two-parameter power equation, and it uses a partial differential equation to capture the variable amount of material mass per unit length throughout the belt length. Verification results show that the power consumption calculations of the newly proposed simpler model are consistent with those of a known non-linear model with an error of less than 4 %. The online parameter identification set-up of the model is proposed. Simulations indicate that the parameters can be identified successfully from data with up to 15 % measurement noise. Results show that the proposed model gives better predictions of the power consumed and material delivered by a long conveyor belt than the steady-state models in the current literature.
