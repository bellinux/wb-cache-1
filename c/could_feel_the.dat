He felt that it was good due to the {{feedback}} he had received and because he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> emotion in the characters' voices. However, he noted that the experience would be different for viewers and that the final judgment could only be made by English-speaking audiences.|$|E

500|$|The composer's {{response}} to his denunciation was the Fifth Symphony of 1937, which was musically more conservative than his earlier works. Premiered on 21 November 1937 in Leningrad, it was a phenomenal success. The Fifth drove many to tears and welling emotions. Later, Shostakovich's purported memoir, Testimony, stated: [...] "I'll never believe {{that a man who}} understood nothing <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> Fifth Symphony. Of course they understood, they understood what was happening around them and they understood what the Fifth was about." ...|$|E

Charles and the orchestra performed it again several nights in a row with the same reaction at each show. He called Jerry Wexler to say he had something new to record, later writing, [...] "I don't believe in giving myself advance notices, but I figured this song merited it".|$|E

500|$|Although Wahlberg, Kitsch, Hirsch and Foster had {{physically}} {{trained for}} their roles prior to filming, Luttrell organized a three-week training regimen at a bootcamp in New Mexico, where the actors were trained by elite military personnel in weapons, {{as well as}} military communications and tactics. Military advisor Mark Semos trained the four actors in live-firing exercises so that they <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> physical impact of firing military rifles.

500|$|While {{the film}} itself {{received}} mostly unfavorable reviews, most critics praised the actingincluding Renoir's, {{and only the}} far right-wing press criticized Marcel Dalio's performance. In July 1939 a right-wing French newspaper criticized the film for portraying the Jewish Marquis married to the Austrian Christine. The Union Sacrée, a French clerical fascist group, organized demonstrations wherever the film was screened. Renoir was a known pacifist and supporter of the Communist Party, which made him unpopular in the tense weeks before World War II began. Years later Renoir said [...] "there was no question of contrivance; my enemies {{had nothing to do}} with its failure. At every session I attended I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> unanimous disapproval of the audience." ...|$|E
500|$|The filming {{introduced}} {{a number of}} technical challenges, with the producer Adam Tandy explaining that the simultaneous singing and conversing made production particularly difficult: [...] "To record it all 'clean' and have options in the edit, that was technically hard on everybody." [...] Typically, karaoke scenes in television will see characters sing only the opening lines, {{but because of the}} format of Inside No. 9, the characters in [...] "Empty Orchestra" [...] sing the whole song. Each character sang a song, with the vocals recorded live. The actors wore an earpiece to listen to the music while singing; Howlett's, used so that she <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> beat, was taped under her wig, and she was counted in by Outhwaite. Filming took a week, with days focussed on particular songs.|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{his long}} army career, Dwight Eisenhower {{and his wife}} never had a house to call their own, with the couple moving from army post to army post. After he became Columbia University's {{president}} in 1948, Mamie requested that they finally {{have a place to}} call their own. A married couple that were friends with the Eisenhowers, George and Mary Allen, had recently purchased a small farm around Gettysburg, and recommended the area. In 1950, they found a [...] "run-down farm" [...] on the outskirts of Gettysburg, and purchased the farm and its [...] for $40,000 (equal to $ today) from one Allen Redding, who had owned the farm since 1921. Eisenhower stated that he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> [...] "forgotten heroisms" [...] that occurred on the grounds as the Battle of Gettysburg.|$|E
500|$|At the hospital, two men forced Feng {{to apply}} her {{thumbprint}} to {{a consent form}} and sign a document authorizing the abortion. [...] She was taken into an operating room and restrained by two men as she was injected with a poison to kill the fetus. Feng later told All Girls Allowed, an American group campaigning against the one-child policy, [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> baby jumping around inside me all the time, but then she went still." [...] She had been seven months pregnant at the time, so the abortion, voluntary or not, was illegal under Chinese law. No family members were allowed to be present for the procedure. After the child died of hypoxia, Feng underwent induced labor and delivered a stillborn girl on June 4. Feng later told All Girls Allowed: [...] "It was much more painful than my first childbirth. The baby was lifeless, and she was all purple and blue." [...] The corpse was then placed next to Feng on her bed for her family to dispose of when they arrived.|$|E
500|$|Mau {{was born}} Pius Piailug in 1932, {{in the village}} of Weiso, on the small coral island of Satawal, in Yap State of the Caroline Islands, a part of the Federated States of Micronesia. Satawal is a wooded island with an area of , located in the western Pacific Ocean about [...] south of Guam. Mau's {{personal}} connection to the sea began early in his life, when he was placed in tide pools in his infancy so he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> pull of the ocean. At the age of four or five, Mau was chosen by his grandfather Raangipi to study as an apprentice navigator. Mau initially protested his grandfather's teaching, preferring to spend his time playing on the beach with children his own age. [...] Raangipi trained Mau as a young navigator for many years. Their day would begin at sunrise, when they would eat breakfast together and afterwards, take care of chores before they went fishing. During the evening, Mau would join the men in the canoe house as they drank, listening to their stories about navigation and sailing. Raangipi told the young boy that if he chose to become a navigator, Mau could gain respect from his community, eat well, and maintain a position in Satawalese society higher than that of a chief. Encouraged, Mau learned basic navigational clues regarding the [...] "stars, swells, and birds" [...] from Raangipi, but his grandfather died sometime before Mau was fourteen.|$|E

500|$|Raleigh's {{commanding}} officer. On selecting Elba, del Toro stated: [...] "This is a {{movie where}} I have {{had to deal with}} more dialogue than ever, and the way I cast the movie was—who do I want to hear say these things? Who do I want Charlie Hunnam to go against? Who can really tell Charlie Hunnam 'sit down and listen'?" [...] In another interview, the director said: [...] "I wanted to have Idris not be the blonde, square-jawed, Anglo, super hip marine that knows [...] I wanted somebody that could bring a lot of authority, but that you <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> weight of the world on his shoulders. When I watched Luther, that's the essence of the character… Luther is carrying literally the evils of the world on his shoulders. He's doing penance for all humanity… Idris is one of those actors that is capable of embodying humanity, in almost like a Rodin sculpture-type, larger than life, almost like a Russian realism statue, you know, big hands, all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes. I wanted somebody that you could have doubts internally, and very few guys can do that." [...] To prepare for the role, Elba watched footage of politicians David Cameron and Barack Obama, as well as Russell Crowe in Gladiator and Mel Gibson in Braveheart. Del Toro initially offered the role to Tom Cruise, who declined because of scheduling conflicts.|$|E
500|$|In May, 2012, Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Resentment" [...] {{as a part}} of her revue show [...] in Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States' entertainment resort, hotel, {{casino and}} spa, Revel. She announced it as her [...] "favorite song" [...] and according to Georgette Cline of The Boombox, [...] "fans <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> pangs of her once-broken heart on 'Resentment,' as she cooed of a lying lover who deceived her". Ben Ratliff of The New York Times mentioned [...] "Resentment" [...] in the [...] "almost continuous high point" [...] of the concert. A writer of the Associated Press, noted that Beyoncé [...] "held back tears during a rousing rendition" [...] of the song. According to Chuck Darrow of The Philadelphia Inquirer, the acoustic performance of the ballad, [...] "proved a nice respite from the relentless thump-thump-thump of the many dance-pop numbers". Tris McCall from The Star-Ledger wrote that Beyoncé brought the song to life further describing the performance as a [...] "full-scale psychological portrait in three and a half minutes". The live performance of the song during the concerts at Revel was used in Beyoncé's HBO documentary film, Life Is But a Dream (2013). Only one shot was used to film it for five minutes. Aaron Parsley from People magazine commented that the rendition of [...] "Resentment" [...] was [...] "grittier and angrier" [...] than the previous performances of the song. The song was also included on the set list of Beyoncé's The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013), during several opening shows of the first leg where she performed it on a B-stage.|$|E

2500|$|Booker's vocal {{ability is}} also a subject that has been covered since his death.

2500|$|Upon {{winning the}} world heavyweight title, Liston had a speech {{prepared}} for the crowd that friends had assured him would meet him at the Philadelphia airport.

2500|$|Under B. A. Alexandrov, the {{ensemble}} was highly disciplined. Boris's party trick {{was to leave}} the stage and allow {{the ensemble}} to perform [...] "En Route" [...] alone.

Leonid Kharitonov remembers: [...] "The Ensemble members were so disciplined and experienced that they <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> rhythm simultaneously and could sing and play together automatically, without the conductor… In Canada during one concert Alexandrov left the Ensemble to perform alone for half an hour." ...|$|E
