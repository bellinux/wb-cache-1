50|$|The {{gameplay}} is {{very similar}} to any other Metal Slug game, but with two new systems; the life system, and the card system. The life system is simply a life bar for players, as it replaces the extra lives from all the other Metal Slug games. As players take damage, the life bar depletes (different attacks cause different amounts of damage). Collecting food items can restore health, and players instantly die from being crushed, or falling down a pit. The Card system is a card <b>collecting</b> <b>part</b> of the game. Cards can be found from shooting certain parts of the background, and by obtaining it from certain hostages, and sometimes by doing both. The cards have many different purposes, from giving detailed info on items and characters from the Metal Slug series to boosting player abilities, and even unlocking special (and new) slugs. There are 100 cards to collect, and collecting them all becomes the main objective to anyone who defeats the final boss.|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} use of an {{interface}} to mark pairs of points on two images which are in “correspondence” with one another, as a way of <b>collecting</b> <b>part</b> annotations. The interface allows annotations of visual categories that are structurally diverse, such as chairs and buildings, where it is difficult to define a set of parts, or landmarks, that are consistent, namable or uniquely defined across all instances of the category. It allows flexibility in annotation – the landmarks can be instance specific, are not constrained by language, could be many to one, etc and requires little category specific instructions. We compare our approach to two popular methods of <b>collecting</b> <b>part</b> annotations, (1) drawing bounding boxes for a set of parts, and (2) annotating a set of landmarks, in terms of annotation setup overhead, cost, difficulty, applicability and utility, and identify scenarios where one method is better suited than the others. Preliminary experiments suggest that such annotations between a sparse set of pairs can be used to bootstrap many high level visual recognition tasks such as part discovery and semantic saliency...|$|E

40|$|An {{innovative}} separator {{have been}} developed which aims at sorting out powders fractions according to aerodynamic and electrostatic properties of particles. The prototype is composed of a projection unit, a separation module and a classification/collection zone. The projection part is ensured by a pressurized gun. The separation module is conceived to disperse particles according to front and transverse directions. At {{the output of the}} gun, electrodes can be disposed to deviate the trajectory of charged particles. The classification part is made of a series of collecting bins. Starch, fine ash powders, and mixtures of these two materials were used to test the working of the separator. The efficiency of the separation was assessed by yields and particle sizes distribution of the collected fractions in the different bins. An aerodynamic classification was achieved along the main axis, with the finest particles crossing larger distances. With a blend of starch and ash, particles from both materials were unevenly distributed in the classifyier, opening the way to a possible separation based simply on aerodynamic properties. When an electric deviation was applied in addition to the projection of powders, the distribution of particles in the <b>collecting</b> <b>part</b> was modified...|$|E

With the validated DEM model, analysis under three conditions of slope angle of separating system compare with horizon (– 7 °, 0 °, and 7 °) was also conducted to examine the conveying performance. From the comparison between the test results and simulation results, the conveying performances of 0 ° and 7 ° were observed {{to be the same}} at the initial period and completion period; however, the gradient of 0 ° and 7 ° from the simulation were higher than the ones from the test by 8. 9 % (0 °) and 9. 2 % (7 °). The higher gradient means that the transport performance is better. The gradient of – 7 ° from the simulation was higher than the one from the test by 3. 6 %, and the amount of the peanuts from the simulation was larger than the test by 500 g at the initial period of 5 seconds. The higher gradient of the simulation was due to the losses at the <b>collecting</b> <b>part</b> as 3. 4 % (0 °), 3. 1 % (7 °), and 2. 0 % (– 7 °). The error in the amount of the peanuts (500 g) at the initial period of 5 seconds with – 7 ° was due to the initial input difference between the test and simulation...|$|E
40|$|Since 1975 {{bar codes}} on {{products}} at the retail counter {{have been accepted}} as the standard for entering product identity for price determination. Since {{the beginning of the}} 21 st century, the Data Matrix symbol has become accepted as the bar code format that is marked directly on a part, assembly or product that is durable enough to identify that item for its lifetime. NASA began the studies for direct part marking Data Matrix symbols on parts during the Return to Flight activities after the Challenger Accident. Over the 20 year period that has elapsed since Challenger, a mountain of studies, analyses and focused problem solutions developed by and for NASA have brought about world changing results. NASA Technical Standard 6002 and NASA Handbook 6003 for Direct Part Marking Data Matrix Symbols on Aerospace Parts have formed the basis for most other standards on part marking internationally. NASA and its commercial partners have developed numerous products and methods that addressed the difficulties of <b>collecting</b> <b>part</b> identification in aerospace operations. These products enabled the marking of Data Matrix symbols in virtually every situation and the reading of symbols at great distances, severe angles, under paint and in the dark without a light. Even unmarkable delicate parts now have a process to apply a chemical mixture called NanocodesTM that can be converted to a Data Matrix. The accompanying intellectual property is protected by 10 patents, several of which are licensed. Direct marking Data Matrix on NASA parts virtually eliminates data entry errors and the number of parts that go through their life cycle unmarked, two major threats to sound configuration management and flight safety. NASA is said to only have people and stuff with information connecting them. Data Matrix {{is one of the most}} significant improvements since Challenger to the safety and reliability of that connection. This presentation highlights the accomplishments of NASA in its efforts to develop technologies for automatic identification, its efforts to implement them and its vision on their role in space...|$|E
