Whitney opts to live with Dot Branning (June Brown) instead of her close family, but Dot convinces her {{to move back to}} Ricky's. When Ryan returns from a holiday, he learns of Whitney's ordeal and urges her to go to the police and get tested for sexually transmitted infections. She says she is not ready to go to the police but agrees to the test, which shows she has a <b>chlamydia</b> <b>infection.</b> When Whitney starts a relationship with a man named Lee (Mitchell Hunt), it is revealed that he is a friend of Rob's, and when Whitney agrees to meet Lee by text, Rob takes control of Lee's mobile phone. She allows Rob to take her home but then tells him to wait outside while she escapes through the back door and hitches a lift to Southend-on-Sea with friends. She leaves him a voicemail message not knowing that he has followed her. He finds her in her hotel room and tells her how much he loves her, but when Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) comes in, Rob attacks him, so Whitney tells him to leave. Fatboy calls Ryan, who comes to Southend to look for Rob. When he finds him, they fight and fall {{over the edge of the}} pier. The next day, a body is recovered from the sea, and is later revealed to be Rob who has died. Whitney thinks Ryan may also be dead until he appears. She tells him she has told the police everything about Rob, including Ryan's fight with him, and Ryan tells Whitney he has to leave. They say an emotional farewell.|$|E
25|$|Tubal factor {{infertility}} can {{be due to}} <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>infection</b> {{and testing}} for Chlamydia antibodies is one diagnostic tool. Women have difficulty getting pregnant or carrying a baby to term due to the buildup of scar tissue in the Fallopian tubes causing damage to the cilia on the epithelial cells. TFI can also be due to endometriosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlamydia</b> <b>infection,</b> often simply {{known as}} chlamydia, is a sexually {{transmitted}} infection caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. Most people who are infected have no symptoms. When symptoms do develop this can take a few weeks following infection to occur. Symptoms in women may include vaginal discharge or burning with urination. Symptoms in men may include discharge from the penis, burning with urination, or pain and swelling of one or both testicles. The infection can spread to the upper genital tract in women causing pelvic inflammatory disease which may result in future infertility or ectopic pregnancy.|$|E

25|$|Risk {{factors for}} ectopic {{pregnancy}} include: pelvic inflammatory disease, often due to <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>infection,</b> tobacco smoking, prior tubal surgery, {{a history of}} infertility, {{and the use of}} assisted reproductive technology. Those who have previously had an ectopic pregnancy are at much higher risk of having another one. Most ectopic pregnancies (90%) occur in the Fallopian tube which are known as tubal pregnancies. Implantation can also occur on the cervix, ovaries, or within the abdomen. Detection of ectopic pregnancy is typically by blood tests for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and ultrasound. This may require testing on more than one occasion. Ultrasound works best when performed from within the vagina. Other causes of similar symptoms include: miscarriage, ovarian torsion, and acute appendicitis.|$|E
500|$|While {{urbanisation}} {{can pose}} a threat to koala populations, the animals can survive in urban areas provided enough trees are present. Urban populations have distinct vulnerabilities: collisions with vehicles and attacks by domestic dogs kill about 4,000 animals every year. Injured koalas are often taken to wildlife hospitals and rehabilitation centres. In a 30-year retrospective study performed at a New South Wales koala rehabilitation centre, [...] trauma (usually resulting from a motor vehicle accident or dog attack) was found to be the most frequent cause of admission, followed by symptoms of <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>infection.</b> Wildlife caretakers are issued special permits, but must release the animals back into the wild when they are either well enough or, in the case of joeys, old enough. As with most native animals, the koala cannot legally be kept as a pet in Australia or anywhere else.|$|E

40|$|Epithelial cells play an {{important}} role in host defense as sentinels for invading microbial pathogens. Chlamydia trachomatis is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that replicates in reproductive tract epithelium. Epithelial cells lining the reproductive tract likely play a key role in triggering inflammation and adaptive immunity during <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>infections.</b> For this report a murine oviduct epithelial cell line was derived in order to determine how epithelial cells influence innate and adaptive immune responses during <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>infections.</b> As expected, oviduct epithelial cells infected by Chlamydia muridarum produced a broad spectrum of chemokines, including CXCL 16, and regulators of the acute-phase response, including interleukin- 1 α (IL- 1 α), IL- 6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. In addition, infected epithelial cells expressed cytokines that augment gamma interferon (IFN) production, including IFN-α/β and IL- 12 -p 70. To my knowledge this is the first report of a non-myeloid/lymphoid cell type making IL- 12 -p 70 in response to an infection. Equally interesting, infected epithelial cells significantly upregulated transforming growth factor alpha precursor expression, suggesting a mechanism by which they might play a direct role in the pathological scarring seen as a consequence of <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>infections.</b> Data from these in vitro studies predict that infected oviduct epithelium contributes significantly to host innate and adaptive defenses but may also participate in the immunopathology seen with <b>Chlamydia</b> <b>infections...</b>|$|R
