40|$|Although the Internet’s routing {{system has}} serious {{security}} vulnerabilities, {{none of the}} existing proposals for a secure variant of BGP has been successfully deployed in practice. This is not surprising since deploying protocols that require the cooperation {{of tens of thousands}} of independentlyoperated networks is problematic. Instead, we argue that small groups should be the basis for securing BGP and we offer an alternative design in which interdomain routing is secured by a few (e. g., 5 – 10) participating ASes. We conduct extensive simulations on a realistic Internet topology to identify conditions for small groups to be effective. Even though the non-participants outnumber the group members by several orders of magnitude, the participants can achieve remarkable security gains by filtering compromised interdomain routes, cooperating to expose additional path diversity, inducing non-participants to select valid routes, and enlisting a few large ISPs to participate. We also propose two novel mechanisms that the group members can employ to achieve these goals, namely secure overlay routing and the <b>cooperative</b> <b>announcement</b> of each other’s address space. Our experiments show that combining these two techniques allows small groups to secure interdomain routing. 1...|$|E

40|$|This work {{examines}} 2486 <b>cooperative</b> arrangement <b>announcements</b> {{signed by}} firms that quote in the Spanish stock market {{during the period}} 1990 - 2002. To investigate, its more prominent characteristics are analyzed: sector of activity of the signatory companies; if the agreement is going to carry out in Spain or abroad; number of partners (and their nationality); governmental participation; value chain {{area in which the}} agreement is developed; their vertical, competitive or complementary character; alliance typology; legal implementation and if notification to the National Commission of the Stock Market exists. This way, an extensive vision of the reality of the alliances established by the most prominent companies of the Spanish panorama is offered...|$|R
40|$|At this, {{the first}} year-end {{meeting of the}} Fundamental Aeronautics Program, an {{overview}} of the Airport Noise discipline of the Supersonics Project leads the presentation of technical plans and achievements in this area of the Project. The overview starts by defining the Technical Challenges targeted by Airport Noise efforts, and the Approaches planned to meet these challenges. These are fleshed out in Elements, namely Prediction, Diagnostics, and Engineering, and broken down into Tasks. The Tasks level is where individual researchers' work is defined and from whence the technical presentations to follow this presentation come. This overview also presents the Milestones accomplished to date and to be completed in the next year. Finally, the NASA Research <b>Announcement</b> <b>cooperative</b> agreement activities are covered and tied to the Tasks and Milestones...|$|R
