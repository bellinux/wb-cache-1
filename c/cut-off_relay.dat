2500|$|Another {{important}} improvement {{involved a}} fundamental change in the electrical logic of the switching system. The Panel originally shipped in a ground cut-off (GCO) configuration. A busy line condition was indicated by ground potential at the <b>cut-off</b> <b>relay,</b> and thus at the sleeve lead, which would be detected by the selector as it hunted over the terminals. Starting in 1929, all newer panel systems were deployed as battery cut-off (BCO) systems. In this revision, the presence of [...] level on the sleeve lead indicated busy status. This change necessitated {{a fundamental change}} {{in the design of the}} system, and was undertaken for many reasons. One of the most notable was that GCO offices were more prone to fire.|$|E
500|$|The [...] season {{turned out}} to be Ball's best {{statistical}} year, resulting in several career high numbers being set. He batted [...]296 and amassed 122 hits, 9 triples, 45 RBI and hit 3 home runs, though he also recorded the third highest number of strikeouts in the AL with 93. Although his defense was never stellar, he executed two noted plays that season. He made a one-handed stop against the Chicago White Sox that was described as [...] "marvelous" [...] by The New York Times and held the Yankees (his former team) to a 3â€“3 draw when Ball, serving as the <b>cut-off</b> man, successfully <b>relayed</b> the ball thrown from right fielder Shoeless Joe Jackson to catcher Gus Fisher. In doing so, he nailed Birdie Cree (who represented the Yankees' winning run) at home plate and the game was immediately suspended due to darkness. However, in a rematch against the White Sox on May 5, 1912, Ball suffered a momentary defensive lapse that ultimately cost his team the game. In the sixth inning, he was unable to catch Shano Collins stealing second base and then inexplicably held onto the ball. This allowed Ping Bodie to advance to home plate and score the winning run. On June 25, the Boston Red Sox purchased Ball's contract from the Naps for $2,500 ($ in today's dollars).|$|R
