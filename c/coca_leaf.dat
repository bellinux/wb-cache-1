There are adaptations of the {{cocktail}} in Peru using fruits such as maracuya, aguaymanto, and apples, or traditional ingredients {{such as the}} <b>coca</b> <b>leaf.</b> In Chile, variants include the Ají Sour (with a spicy green chili), Mango Sour (with mango juice), and Sour de Campo (with ginger and honey). In Bolivia, the Yunqueño variant (from its Yungas region) replaces the lime with orange juice.|$|E

The facility, {{which had been}} known as the Maywood Chemical Works (and is also a known Superfund site), was purchased by Stepan in 1959. The plant is the only commercial entity in the country authorized by the Drug Enforcement Administration to import coca leaves, which come primarily from Peru. The non-narcotic extract is sold to Coke, while the active ingredient is sold to a pharmaceutical firm for medicinal purposes.|$|E
25|$|Chapman J. Root, {{president}} of the Root Glass Company of Terre Haute, Indiana, turned the project over to members of his supervisory staff, including company auditor T. Clyde Edwards, plant superintendent Alexander Samuelsson, and Earl R. Dean, bottle designer and supervisor of the bottle molding room. Root and his subordinates decided to base the bottle's design {{on one of the}} soda's two ingredients, the <b>coca</b> <b>leaf</b> or the kola nut, but were unaware of what either ingredient looked like. Dean and Edwards went to the Emeline Fairbanks Memorial Library and were unable to find any information about coca or kola. Instead, Dean was inspired by a picture of the gourd-shaped cocoa pod in the Encyclopædia Britannica. Dean made a rough sketch of the pod and returned to the plant to show Root. He explained to Root how he could transform the shape of the pod into a bottle. Root gave Dean his approval.|$|E
30|$|Finally, {{and since}} {{corruption}} levels in Bolivia seem to decrease with less government {{control on the}} market for <b>coca</b> <b>leafs,</b> perhaps outright, unilateral formalization and legalization of all coca cultivations, regardless of their final destination, may produce the desired outcome of less corruption and more transparency in a country that certainly needs more accountability in every front.|$|R
40|$|Bolivia vigorously {{opposes the}} {{conflation}} of coca and cocaine in international drug prohibition and has innovated its domestic coca policies while pursuing an international campaign {{to change the}} <b>coca</b> <b>leaf’s</b> legal status. However, it has also taken very seriously certain commitments of the global drug prohibition regime, such as combating illegal drug trafficking and coca-paste interdiction. Bolivian policies under Evo Morales and the MAS both resist and comply to international drug prohibition. This thesis is interested in exploring the developments leading up to this change in Bolivian policy and subsequent actions undertaken domestically and in the international arena. My principal academic interest is to bring clarity to Bolivian coca policy innovations, domestic and international, {{in relation to the}} drug prohibition regime and the American drug war...|$|R

500|$|In his speeches, Morales {{presented}} the <b>coca</b> <b>leaf</b> {{as a symbol}} of Andean culture that was under threat from the imperialist oppression of the U.S. In his view, the U.S. should deal with their domestic cocaine abuse problems without interfering in Bolivia, arguing that they had no right trying to eliminate coca, a legitimate product with many uses which played a rich role in Andean culture. In a speech on this issue, Morales told reporters [...] "I am not a drug trafficker. I am a coca grower. I cultivate <b>coca</b> <b>leaf,</b> which is a natural product. I do not refine (it into) cocaine, and neither cocaine nor drugs have ever been part of the Andean culture." [...] On another, he asserted that [...] "We produce our coca, we bring it to the main markets, we sell it and that's where our responsibility ends." ...|$|E
500|$|Morales's unorthodox {{behavior}} {{contrasts with}} the usual manners of dignitaries and other political leaders in Latin America. During speeches he made use of personal stories and anecdotes, and used coca as [...] "a potent political symbol", wearing a <b>coca</b> <b>leaf</b> garland {{around his neck and}} a hat with coca leaves in it when speaking to crowds of supporters. Following his election, he wore striped jumpers rather than the suits typically worn by politicians. It became a symbol of Morales, with copies of it selling widely in Bolivia.|$|E
500|$|Morales {{came to an}} {{agreement}} with David Añez Pedraza, {{the leader of a}} defunct yet still registered party named the Movement for Socialism (MAS); under this agreement, Morales and the Six Federaciónes could take over the party name, with Pendraza stipulating the condition that they must maintain its own acronym, name and colors. Thus the defunct right wing MAS became the flourishing left wing vehicle for the coca activist movement known as the Movement for Socialism – Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples. The MAS would come to be described as [...] "an indigenous-based political party that calls for the nationalization of industry, legalization of the <b>coca</b> <b>leaf</b> ... and fairer distribution of national resources." [...] The party lacked the finance available to the mainstream parties, and so relied largely on the work of volunteers in order to operate. It was not structured like other political parties, instead operating as the political wing of the social movement, with all tiers in the movement involved in decision making; this form of organisation would continue until 2004.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{since the}} {{earliest}} times, people have exploited {{some of the}} many psychoactive substances manufactured by plants in religious rituals and for pleasure. [...] Among the most widely used throughout history are alcohol, produced by fermenting cereals with yeast (a fungus), tobacco, coffee, tea, chocolate, cannabis, <b>coca</b> (used as <b>leaf</b> for some 8,000 years in Peru,and in recent times also purified to cocaine), mescaline (from a cactus) and psilocybin (from a fungus).|$|R
40|$|Coca (Erythroxylum sp.) is a genus {{of plants}} in the family Erythroxylaceae, whose most {{important}} species come from the Andean region of South America. Coca leaves are traditionally used as a medicament, a stimulant or {{for the production of}} food products. In some areas, coca {{is an important part of}} the culture. On the other hand, coca is notoriously known as a raw material for the production of cocaine which is then illegally distributed throughout the world. The aim of this thesis was to objectively summarize and evaluate information about coca shrub, its expansion, growing, and especially about the use and importance of the <b>coca</b> <b>leafs.</b> This information was obtained from specialist literature, scientific articles and works of national and international organizations. Coca leaves contain high levels of lipids, protein, carbohydrates, fibre, vitamins A, E, B 2, B 5, B 6 and B 12, calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, potassium and zinc in comparison with selected food (corn, beans, bananas, cow milk, chicken meat), they also have a high calorific value. Therefore, coca is an important nutritional additive. The leaves are chewed or used to manufacture traditional medicines, alcoholic drinks, mate de coca tea, Coca-Cola, cosmetic products, cigarettes, and concentrated cocaine, which occurs in coca leaves as an alkaloid to a concentration of 1, 5 %. Coca is part of traditional festivals and celebrations (e. g. baptisms, engagements, weddings and funerals), serves as a sacrifice and an idol, is offered at social gatherings and appears in folk tales. Coca is chewed mainly for its stimulant effects, it also suppresses hunger and fatigue and generally improves mood. In terms of pharmaceutical effects, risks and other factors, coca cannot be regarded as comparable to cocaine. Thanks to its positive effects and profound cultural importance, coca should remain part of the Andean tradition. In addition, it could also find use in modern medicine. Coca would not have to be considered merely as a dangerous drug...|$|R
2500|$|After 1904, {{instead of}} using fresh leaves, Coca-Cola started using [...] "spent" [...] leaves – the {{leftovers}} of the cocaine-extraction process with trace levels of cocaine. Since then, Coca-Cola uses a cocaine-free <b>coca</b> <b>leaf</b> extract prepared at a Stepan Company plant in Maywood, New Jersey.|$|E
2500|$|When launched, Coca-Cola's two key {{ingredients}} were {{cocaine and}} caffeine.

2500|$|Pemberton {{called for}} five ounces of <b>coca</b> <b>leaf</b> per gallon of syrup, a {{significant}} dose; in 1891, Candler claimed his formula (altered extensively from Pemberton's original) contained only {{a tenth of}} this amount. Coca-Cola once contained an estimated nine milligrams of cocaine per glass. (For comparison, a typical dose or [...] "line" [...] of cocaine is 50–75mg.) In 1903, it was removed.|$|E
2500|$|These {{profound}} {{economic and}} social changes, and the breakup of native culture contributed to the increasing addiction to alcohol. Before the Spanish arrived, the Incas had consumed alcohol only during religious ceremonies. Indian use of the <b>coca</b> <b>leaf</b> also increased, and, according to one chronicler, {{at the end of}} the 16th century [...] "in Potosí alone, the trade in coca amounts to over half a million pesos a year, for 95,000 baskets of it are consumed." ...|$|E
2500|$|With US {{government}} cooperation, the Peruvian Government {{installed the}} National Plan for the Prevention and Control of Drugs in 1995. [...] This government prohibition of narcotics trafficking in Peru {{has resulted in}} a 70% reduction of <b>coca</b> <b>leaf</b> cultivation since 1995. [...] However the reduction in cultivation may not have actual effects on cocaine production, as recent advances in coca growing and more efficient processing methods allow for greater cocaine yield. [...] The size of the narcotics industry {{as a part of the}} national economy is difficult to measure, but estimates range from $300–$600 million. An estimated 200,000 Peruvian households have economies based on the production, refining, or distribution of coca. Many economists believe that large flows of dollars into the banking system contribute to the traditional depression of the dollar exchange rate vis-a-vis the sol. [...] The Central Bank engages in open market activities to prevent the price of the sol from rising to levels that would cause Peruvian exports to become prohibitively expensive.|$|E
2500|$|Coca has a {{long history}} of {{cultivation}} in the Andes, and has always been a traditional part of Peruvian life. [...] However, the narcotic properties of coca were known only locally until 1786, when Lamarck listed the leaf in his botanical encyclopedia. [...] After the arrival of the Spanish, coca cultivation increased and its use became more common and widespread. [...] Since 1543, coca has been internationally recognized for its trading value, and regulations imposed upon it have attached increasing economic importance to the plant. [...] Exchange of the <b>coca</b> <b>leaf</b> between consumers in the highlands and growers in the low-lying hills has gone on for at least the last millennium, strengthening local economic ties. [...] Between 1884 and 1900, coca and cocaine grew in popularity for medical purposes and mass consumption in the United States. [...] From 1905 to 1922, anti-cocaine sentiments in the US resulted in criminalization of both coca and cocaine. It was not until the 1920s that US diplomats began to extend drug prohibitions internationally.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{organization}} {{authorized to}} purchase coca leaves is ENACO S.A., headquartered in Peru.
