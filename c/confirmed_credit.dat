50|$|An {{acceptance}} credit {{is a type}} of letter of credit that is paid by a time draft authorizing payment on or after a specific date, if the terms of the letter of credit have been complied with. There are two types of acceptance <b>credit,</b> <b>confirmed</b> and unconfirmed. Unconfirmed {{acceptance credit}} means that the seller takes the risk that payment will not be made, due to any number of contingencies such as shipment non-delivery, confiscation by customs authorities, or any other problems. <b>Confirmed</b> acceptance <b>credit</b> means that the bank upon which the credit has been issued, essentially guarantees payment as long as the terms of the letter of credit have been complied with.|$|R

5000|$|Some comics historians theorize he {{may have}} been an inker on some portion of Kirby's {{landmark}} comic The Fantastic Four #1 (Nov. 1961), for which George Klein is the generally recognized, uncredited inker.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{theoretical}} framework and provide empirical estimates {{of the extent of}} several forms of restructuring in 130 privatized Slovenian firms during the 1996 - 1998 period. In view of the developments in the transition economies, we divide restructuring into defensive (related to cutting costs) and strategic (focused on increasing revenues). On the basis of formal model we apply a labour demand equation to test defensive restructuring and the extended investment equation for strategic restructuring analysis. Labour demand estimation confirms relatively slow defensive restructuring. Investment model estimations <b>confirm</b> <b>credit</b> rationing and bargaining hypothesis in all types of soft investment except in the case of training. Similarly, the proven accelerator model hypothesis implies that Slovenian firms started to behave similar as the firms from developed countries following profit maximization goal. We didn’t find support for hypothesis that firms treat training expenses as an investment...|$|R

5000|$|Miller {{grew up a}} comics fan; {{a letter}} he wrote to Marvel Comics was {{published}} in The Cat #3 (April 1973).

50|$|<b>Confirmed</b> {{acceptance}} <b>credit</b> is {{more expensive}} to establish than unconfirmed acceptance credit because the issuing bank is effectively guaranteeing payment.
