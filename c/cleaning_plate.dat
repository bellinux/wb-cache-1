30|$|Water is {{absolutely}} essential for sustenance of life, although millions of people worldwide are suffering from shortage of fresh and clean water. This {{is due to the}} rapid pace of industrialization, population expansion, and unplanned urbanization which have contributed largely to environmental pollution. Industries where textile, paper, rubber, plastics, paints and leather are manufactured discharge colored effluents into the environment, metals come from different sources like mining, metal <b>cleaning,</b> <b>plating</b> baths, pulp, paper and paper board mills, refineries and fertilizer industries (Tan et al. 2008; Jordi et al. 2009). The effluents discharged from these industries into water bodies have raised much concern because of potential health hazards associated with the entry of these toxic components into the food chain (Helen and Lima 2010). The presence of dyes, pigment and heavy metals in effluents from industries are some of the factors that lowers water quality, these pollutants are potential cause of adverse effects on health, increased environmental toxicity and poor aesthetic quality of water depending on the concentration of these pollutants in the environment (Jesus et al. 2011; Jafar and Shajudha 2012; Yadav et al. 2013).|$|R

[l] Several heavy metals such as chromium, copper, lead, mercury and zinc are listed as priority pollutants by EPA and require monitoring for NPDES permit compliance or for compliance with point source discharge pretreatment requirements. [2] Leachate from solid waste landfills often contain high concentrations of metals such as iron and manganese, as well as trace concentrations of other metals such as copper, nickel, and lead. [3] Measurement of metals such as chromium, lead, mercury, and iron are typically performed to characterize the quality of drinking water and ground water. [4] Although Atomic Absorption Spectrometry is the typical method of metals analysis required for compliance reporting and other official purposes [5], this method is not practical for continuous on-line monitoring in multi-constituent media due to sample preparation requirements and apparatus that can handle {{only a limited number of}} samples.

40|$|The {{customary}} {{approach to}} the study of meal size suggests that ‘events’ occurring during a meal lead to its termination. Recent research, however, suggests that a number of decisions are made before eating commences that may affect meal size. The present study sought to address three key research questions around meal size: the extent to which <b>plate</b> <b>cleaning</b> occurs; prevalence of pre-meal planning and its influence on meal size; and the effect of within-meal experiences, notably the development of satiation. To address these, a large-cohort internet-based questionnaire was developed. Results showed that <b>plate</b> <b>cleaning</b> occurred at 91 % of meals, and was planned from the outset in 92 % of these cases. A significant relationship between <b>plate</b> <b>cleaning</b> and meal planning was observed. Pre meal plans were resistant to modification {{over the course of the}} meal: only 18 % of participants reported consumption that deviated from expected. By contrast, 28 % reported continuing eating beyond satiation, and 57 % stated that they could have eaten more at the end of the meal. Logistic regression confirmed pre-meal planning as the most important predictor of consumption. Together, our findings demonstrate the importance of meal planning as a key determinant of meal size and energy intake...|$|R

30|$|Since {{the dawn}} of industrialization, water {{pollution}} is a critical environmental issue as the industrial wastewater containing various pollutants is directly or indirectly released into the water bodies that undoubtedly interrupt the aquatic biota. Among the various pollutants such as organic or inorganic chemicals, dyes and pesticides, heavy metals in wastewater {{play a crucial role}} due to their toxic and carcinogenic nature (Sen et al. 2017). Furthermore, they cannot be biodegraded rather bioaccumulated in the living body causing serious health hazards and even death (Tangahu et al. 2011). The atomic weights of heavy metals vary between 63.5 and 200.6, and their specific gravities are five times higher than that of water (Shanab et al. 2012). Chromium is commonly found in wastewater of tannery, textile, paint, ink, aluminum, galvanometry and electric, dyes and pigments, metal <b>cleaning,</b> <b>plating</b> and electroplating, film and photography, mining, leather industries, and its concentration can range from tens to hundreds of mg/L (Han et al. 2008). Cr(III) and Cr(VI) are the most stable form of chromium (Gupta and Rastogi 2009). Though Cr(III) is used as an important nutrient to animals, the toxicity of Cr(VI) is near about 300 times more than Cr(III) because of its profound carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects (Qu et al. 2014). Adverse health effects of chromium depend on its dose, exposure duration and the nature of compound. As per World Health Organization (WHO), the maximum allowable limit of hexavalent chromium is 0.05  mg/L in drinking water (Gupta and Rastogi 2009). Thus, chromium removal from wastewater is mandatory before releasing into the environment.|$|R

30|$|Chromium is a {{naturally}} occurring element found in soil and groundwater {{in several different}} forms. It occurs in the (VI) and (III) oxidation states (Banfalvi 2011). The use of chromium chemicals in several industrial processes (leather tanning, mining of chrome ore, production of steel and alloys, dyes and pigment manufacturing, glass industry, wood preservation, textile industry, film and photography, metal <b>cleaning,</b> <b>plating</b> and electroplating, etc.) leads to contamination of natural waters mainly due to improper disposal methods (Sarin et al. 2006). While Cr(III) is generally non-toxic and {{is believed to be}} essential in glucose metabolism in mammals (Rengaraj et al. 2001), Cr(VI) is toxic to animal and plant cells. Furthermore, it is dangerous for human beings due to its mutagenic and carcinogenic properties (Arslan and Pehlivan 2007). Since the compounds of chromium are known to be harmful to human health, the maximum level permitted in wastewater is 5  ppm for trivalent chromium and 0.05  ppm for hexavalent chromium (Namasivayam and Senthilkumar 1999). Arsenic compounds are rather widely distributed in nature and they can be often found in groundwater and drinking water, mainly due to erosion and weathering of As-containing soils and minerals, as well as from industrial effluents and via atmospheric deposition (burning of fossil fuels) (Bortun et al. 2010). Water contaminated by arsenic may cause numerous diseases of the skin and internal organs (Shevade and Ford 2004; Mohan and Pittman 2007). An inorganic form of arsenic is highly toxic compared to organic arsenic. Inorganic arsenate (AsO 43 −) and arsenite (AsO 33 −), referred to As(V) and As(III) are most common in natural waters. Although As(V) tends to be less toxic compared to that of As(III), it is thermodynamically more stable due to which it predominates under normal conditions and becomes the cause of significant contamination in ground water (Elizalde-Gonzalez et al. 2001; DeMarco et al. 2003). According to WHO the acceptable arsenic content in drinking water does not exceed 0.01  g/m 3 (Dziubek 2006).|$|R

30|$|Heavy metal {{release to}} the {{environment}} has been increasing continuously {{as a result of}} industrial activities and technological development, posing a significant threat {{to the environment}}, public and soil health (Cerbasi and Yetis 2001). Among the heavy metals released into environment, chromium is an important pollutant. Chromium is a redox active element, with oxidation states from − 2 to + 6, but only the + 3 and + 6 states are prevalent in the aqueous environment. Cr(III) and Cr(VI) are environmentally stable oxidation states and exhibit different types of toxicity mechanism on biota. Chromium is released into the environment by a large number of industries such as mining, iron sheet <b>cleaning,</b> chrome <b>plating,</b> leather tanning and wood preservation (Krishna and Philip 2005). These industries contain Cr(III) and Cr(VI) at a concentration ranging from 10 to 100  mg/L (Park et al. 2005). Long-term release of such wastewater may result in the accumulation of heavy metals in soil exerting a selection pressure on soil micro-biota.|$|R

This cleaning process is compared to acid pickling and is shown to produce similar wetting behavior as measured by dynamic contact angle experiments. Additionally, dynamic contact angle measurements with water drops are conducted to show that cathodic arc cleaning can remove organic contaminants as well.

40|$|A new {{industrial}} selective processing technique {{based on}} a confined dynamic liquid drop is presented. This approach is based on localized wet treatment of silicon wafers using confined and dynamic liquid drop that while {{in contact with the}} wafer forms a dynamic liquid meniscus. The concept of dynamic meniscus is inherited from the static meniscus, i. e. the liquid bridge that is formed when a liquid is confined between two surfaces. The difference between the static meniscus and the dynamic one is that the shape is defined by the surface tension, contact angles and gravity in the former, and by the equilibrium between fluid speed and the confinement vacuum in the latter. Such new technique allows to touch in specific defined positions the silicon wafer (front and/or back) in order to perform any kind of wet processing (e. g. etching, <b>cleaning</b> and/or <b>plating)</b> without the need of any protective photo-resist. The main scientific innovation and relevance introduced by this work can be easily applied to industrial solar cell production.

30|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, the {{exponential}} population and social civilization expansion, sharp modernization and metropolitan growth, and continuing progress of the industrial and technologies has largely contributed to the contamination of groundwater and other water resources by toxic heavy metals (Foo and Hameed 2010 a, b). Copper {{is one of the}} most widely used heavy metals. Copper and its compounds are extensively used in various important industrial applications such as electrical wiring, plumbing, gear wheel, air conditioning tubing, and roofing (Chowdhury and Saha 2011). Its potential sources in industrial effluents include metal <b>cleaning</b> and <b>plating</b> baths, fertilizer, refineries, pulp, paper board mills, printed circuit board production, wood pulp production, wood preservatives, paints and pigments, municipal and storm water run-off, etc. (Chowdhury and Saha 2011). Intake of excessively large doses of copper by human beings leads to severe mucosal irritation and corrosion, stomach upset and ulcer, wide spread capillary damage, hepatic and renal damage, central nervous system irritation followed by depression, gastrointestinal irritation, and possible necrotic changes in the liver and kidney (Yao et al. 2010). Chronic copper poisoning can also result in Wilson’s disease leading to brain and liver damage (Jaman et al. 2009). Therefore, removal of copper from effluents is essential not only to protect the water sources but also for the protection of human health.|$|R
40|$|A typical {{electroplating}} {{production line}} for the deposition of silver pattern on copper leadframes in the semiconductor industry involves twenty to twenty five steps of <b>cleaning,</b> pickling, <b>plating,</b> stripping etc. This complex production process occupies large floor space and has also {{a number of problems}} such as difficulty in the production of rubber masks and alignment, generation of toxic fumes, high cost of water consumption and sometimes uncertainty on the cleanliness of the surfaces to be plated. A novel laser patterning process is proposed in this paper which can replace many steps in the existing electroplating line. The proposed process involves the application of high speed laser etching techniques on leadframes which were protected with polymer coating. The desired pattern for silver electroplating is produced by laser ablation of the polymer coating. Excimer laser was found to be most effective for this process as it can expose a pattern of clean copper substrate which can be silver plated successfully. Previous working of Nd:YAG laser ablation showed that 1. 06 μm radiation was not suitable for this etching process because a thin organic and transparent film remained on the laser etched region.

40|$|The {{application}} of photography to astronomy {{was a critical}} step {{in the development of}} astrophysics {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century. Using custom-built photographic telescopes and objective prisms, astronomers took images of the sky on glass plates during a 100 -year period from many observing stations around the globe. After each plate was developed, astronomers and their assistants studied and annotated the plates as they made astrometric, photometric and spectroscopic measurements, counted galaxies, observed stellar variability, tracked meteors, and calculated the ephemerides of asteroids and comets. In this paper, the authors assess the importance of the plate annotations for future scientific, historical, and educational programs. Unfortunately, many of these interesting annotations are now being erased when grime is removed from the plates before they are digitized to make the photometric data available for time-domain astrophysics. To see what professional astronomers and historians think about this situation, the authors conducted a survey. This paper captures the lively discussion on the pros and cons of the removal of plate markings, how to best to document them if they must be cleaned off, and what to do with plates whose annotations are deemed too valuable to be erased. Three appendices to the paper offer professional guidance on the best practices for handling and <b>cleaning</b> the <b>plates,</b> photographing any annotations, and rehousing them.
