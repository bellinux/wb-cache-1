40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis introduces an integer linear program called the Minimum Cost Flow with Congestion Assignment (MCF-CA) model. MCF-CA is a multi-period evacuation model {{that uses a}} novel approach called congestion assignment to analyze <b>clearing</b> <b>times</b> during mass evacuations. Congestion assignment discretizes the nonlinear relationship {{between the number of}} vehicles on a road segment and the maximum speed at which those vehicles can travel. MCF-CA selects among three congestion levels (none, moderate, and high) for each road segment in each time epoch. Depending on the congestion level selected, MCF-CA limits the number of vehicles that are able to traverse the road segment and uses Akeliks Time-Dependent Speed-Flow Function (Akelik 2003) to determine the average travel speed of the vehicles for that time period. As a result, we are able to determine approximate evacuation <b>clearing</b> <b>times</b> under nonlinear congestion effects by solving an integer linear program. We limit residents prior knowledge of traffic conditions by implementing MCF-CA in a rolling horizon fashion and study the impact of this limited knowledge on evacuation patterns. We also model the impact of sub-optimal routing decisions on the part of residents by artificially shifting residents toward their own shortest paths rather than a socially optimal route. We find that a mass evacuation can more than double the <b>clearing</b> <b>times</b> of individual county evacuations. However, during both county and mass evacuations, resident routing choices significantly impact <b>clearing</b> <b>times.</b> As more residents choose suboptimal routes, <b>clearing</b> <b>times</b> are prolonged. Lastly, we find that more than 50 % of residents will experience congestion {{at some point during the}} evacuation horizon. However, allowing some congestion improves evacuation <b>clearing</b> <b>times</b> by 2036 % over not congesting. Although congestion decreases vehicle travel speed by 7080 %, over 50 % more residents are able to start or continue evacuating during each time epoch.

While convenient for the consumer, phone billing has several inherent issues for merchants. Payment processors that support phone billing typically charge a higher rate because the payments must go through an additional party, the phone provider, before reaching the merchant. The <b>clearing</b> <b>time</b> on funds is also exceptionally high because the funds are not collected until the consumer pays their phone bill.|$|E
50|$|Earth Potential Rise (EPR) {{is caused}} by {{electrical}} faults that occur at electrical substations, power plants, or high-voltage transmission lines. Short-circuit current flows through the plant structure and equipment and into the grounding electrode. The resistance of the Earth is non-zero, so current injected into the earth at the grounding electrode produces a potential rise {{with respect to a}} distant reference point. The resulting potential rise can cause hazardous voltage, many hundreds of metres away from the actual fault location. Many factors determine the level of hazard, including: available fault current, soil type, soil moisture, temperature, underlying rock layers, and <b>clearing</b> <b>time</b> to interrupt a fault.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} {{progress}} through {{certain parts of}} the story, players need to free Electoons. The most common way to get Electoons is to free them from cages; there is one {{at the end of each}} level, with more to be found in hidden areas and are guarded by several enemies that collectively use a forcefield to protect the cage, the team must defeat every single enemy that uses the forcefield, then the cage can be destroyed. The cage can only be damaged on the side which has a green padlock. Most of the cages are hidden away in secret passages, so once the Electoons are free, they will create a portal which leads to the outside of these passages. Each level contains a medallion that shows how many Electoon challenges the players completed, such as break a single cage, collect a specific amount of Lums or beat the clock whilst the level has been completed. In every level there are hidden cages ranging from 1 to 3. More Electoons can be earned by collecting a certain amount of Lums within a level and <b>clearing</b> <b>Time</b> Trials that are unlocked after clearing a level once.
