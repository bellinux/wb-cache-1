An hour after that, the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor. On 10 December, Prince of Wales and Repulse, sailing {{to meet the}} Malaya invasion force, were sunk by Japanese air attack. After the disastrous Malayan Campaign, Singapore surrendered on 15 February 1942.

5000|$|The show {{deliberately}} uses {{a slower}} pace in the interviews as compared with a typical celebrity interview, thus cameras usually record a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> conversation, <b>later</b> edited {{to one or two}} hours, a trick used by Groucho Marx on his 1950s quiz show You Bet Your Life. The result, as a New York Times article put it, [...] "In Mr. Lipton's guest chair, actors cease being stars for a while and become artists and teachers." [...] Though sometimes, some interviews go longer; Steven Spielberg's 1999 visit, for example, stretched to four <b>hours,</b> and was <b>later</b> shown as two episodes <b>of</b> one <b>hour</b> each. The interviews are guided by Lipton's trademark index-card questions, which sometimes reveal his well-researched knowledge of guests' lives, often startling some. On one such occasion, Billy Crystal told Lipton, [...] "You know you're scary, don't you?" [...] On another occasion, Martin Sheen asked Lipton, [...] "How do you know all this? This is extraordinary." [...] And Sir Anthony Hopkins, upon learning that Lipton knew the exact address where the former had been born and raised in Wales, turned to the audience and remarked, [...] "He's a detective, you know." ...|$|R
500|$|On 14 November at 06:30 4th Light Horse Brigade entered El Tineh {{with the}} rest of the Australian Mounted Division {{following}} a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later.</b> Here good wells containing plenty of water were found but without steam pumps and so watering was not complete until 16:00.

Meanwhile, the Australian Mounted Divisional Supply Train followed the fighting units as closely as they could, moving out from Beersheba via Hareira and Gaza on 11 November to Isdud on 14 November; to Mesymie the day after and Junction Station on 16 November.|$|E
500|$|In late May 1942, in {{an effort}} to draw out and destroy the elusive American carriers, Japanese forces {{organized}} attacks on the Aleutian Islands in Alaska and Midway Atoll in the Western Pacific. Nagumo, aboard Akagi, led Kaga, Sōryū, and Hiryū and the support ships of the First Carrier Striking Force to Midway. In the initial attack, Japanese planes neutralized a small force of fighter aircraft and inflicted heavy damage to American installations. Torpedo planes and dive-bombers sent from Midway to harry the Japanese fleet had little effect, but the Japanese attack plan had been deciphered by codebreakers, and the American carriers' planes were already en route. Torpedo bombers from , , and [...] joined the attack in succession, forcing the Japanese carriers to maneuver violently to avoid torpedoes and rendering them unable to launch additional aircraft. American dive-bombers, arriving late after difficulty locating the fleet, soon landed fatal strikes on Akagi, Kaga, and Sōryū. Yorktown, handicapped by hits from Hiryūs bombers, managed to return to the fight only to take two torpedo hits a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later.</b> The burning Yorktown was abandoned, but her scouts pinpointed Hiryūs location, and bombers from Enterprise put Hiryū out of action with four bomb strikes. Japan lost all four carriers of the First Carrier Striking Force at Midway.|$|E
