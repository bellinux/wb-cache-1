40|$|Conjugation {{reactions}} on proteins {{have been}} used to access various post-translational modifications, for targeted delivery of drugs, for microscopy, and in studying receptor-ligand interactions. However, the ability to modify native proteins is constrained by the reactive functionalities of naturally occurring amino acids. This has driven research into the incorporation of unnatural amino acids (UAAs) into proteins. Research in this area has been motivated both by the possibility of increasing the breadth of chemical techniques for protein modification by introducing novel 'bio-orthogonal' reactive groups via UAA incorporation, as well as generating well-defined conjugates by the site-selective incorporation <b>of</b> these <b>UAAs</b> into proteins. The objective of this thesis is to both expand the diversity <b>of</b> <b>UAAs</b> for access to new metal-mediated reactions on proteins, as well as to utilise these reactions to reveal functional information about a range of biological systems. A brief introduction into current protein conjugation and UAA incorporation methods will be made in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2, the genetic incorporation <b>of</b> alkene-bearing <b>UAAs</b> into recombinant proteins expressed in both bacterial and mammalian systems is discussed. This technique is demonstrated to enable Ru-catalysed olefin cross-metathesis (CM) reactions on the resultant proteins. This work builds upon previously established methods to chemically incorporate CM handles onto proteins. The rational design <b>of</b> <b>UAAs,</b> as well as assays and modelling studies to screen them for recognition by the cellular incorporation machinery are discussed in detail. The expression of a range of alkene-tagged recombinant proteins, their complete characterisation, as well as the development of a more general protocol for on-protein CM is elucidated. In Chapter 3, the utility <b>of</b> <b>UAA</b> incorporation to probe mammalian cell translation systems is examined. Incorporation <b>of</b> an azide-bearing <b>UAA,</b> in addition to heavy stable-isotope labelled amino acids is used to uncover a previously unreported system of protein synthesis in mammalian cell nuclei, along with rapid metabolic degradation of the synthesised peptides. Various orthogonal methods for the detection of this system as well as possible reasons for its conservation are discussed. In Chapter 4, UAA incorporation and metal-mediated bioconjugation reactions are utilised {{in the development of a}} novel and generally applicable proteomics technique. This technique is used to determine quantitative changes in cell proteomes in response to external stimuli, and may be applied to systems to which traditional proteomics techniques cannot, such as ex vivo primary cells. Finally, in Chapter 5, further applications <b>of</b> <b>UAA</b> incorporation are discussed. Preliminary results are reported in efforts to use UAAs in the vibrational Raman microscopic imaging of biological systems, in generating HIV vaccines, and inducing T-cell stimulation.

40|$|Background: Genetic code {{expansion}} {{has developed}} into an elegant tool to incorporate unnatural amino acids (uAA) at predefined {{sites in the}} protein backbone {{in response to an}} amber codon. However, recombinant production and yield <b>of</b> <b>uAA</b> comprising proteins are challenged due to the additional translation machinery required for uAA incorporation. Results: We developed a microtiter plate-based high-throughput monitoring system (HTMS) to study and optimize uAA integration in the model protein enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP). Two uAA, propargyl-L-lysine (Plk) and (S) - 2 -amino- 6 -((2 -azidoethoxy) carbonylamino) hexanoic acid (Alk), were incorporated at the same site into eGFP co-expressing the native PylRS/tRNAPyl CUA pair originating from Methanosarcina barkeri in E. coli. The site-specific uAA functionalization was confirmed by LC-MS/MS analysis. uAA-eGFP production and biomass growth in parallelized E. coli cultivations was correlated to (i) uAA concentration and the (ii) time <b>of</b> <b>uAA</b> addition to the expression medium as well as to induction parameters including the (iii) time and (iv) amount of IPTG supplementation. The online measurements of the HTMS were consolidated by end point-detection using standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent procedures. Conclusion: The developed HTMS is powerful tool for parallelized and rapid screening. In light <b>of</b> <b>uAA</b> integration, future applications may include parallelized screening of different PylRS/tRNAPyl CUA pairs as well as further optimization of culture conditions...|$|R

40|$|Unnatural {{amino acid}} (UAA) {{incorporation}} is an invaluable technique that is seeing increased use. THG 73 is an amber suppressor tRNA used to incorporate > 100 residues at the UAG, amber stop codon, in Xenopus oocytes. We {{have found that}} yeast Phe frameshift suppressors (YFFS) can incorporate UAAs at the CGGG and GGGU quadruplet codons in vitro and in vivo, allowing simultaneous incorporation <b>of</b> three <b>UAAs</b> in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). The YFFS are more “orthogonal” than the amber suppressor tRNA, THG 73, but the frameshift suppressors incorporate UAAs less efficiently than THG 73. A library of tRNAs derived from THG 73 has produced an amber suppressor that is “orthogonal” and suppresses similarly to THG 73. An analogous opal suppressor tRNA allows incorporation <b>of</b> <b>UAAs</b> at the UGA, opal stop codon. The use of the amber, opal, CGGG, and GGGU codons should allow for the simultaneous incorporation <b>of</b> four <b>UAAs</b> in vivo. Bioorthogonal labeling <b>of</b> <b>UAAs</b> is useful for the addition of large fluorophores. We incorporated p-AcPhe at α 70 of the nAChR and labeled with biotin and Cy 5. 5 hydrazide. Biotin and Cy 5. 5 hydrazide consistently labeled three proteins on oocytes not expressing α 70 p-AcPhe and isn’t useful for site-specific labeling <b>of</b> ketone containing <b>UAAs</b> in oocytes. We explored the known subunit stoichiometry of the nAChR (2 α:β:γ:δ) expressed in oocytes and detected each subunit with the HA tag by Western blot. The α-subunit is present {{in excess of the}} other subunits in a ratio of ≈ 3 : 1, which is expected to be 2 : 1. UAAs are being sold commercially for detection of protein-protein interactions in eukaryotic cells. The UAAs are heterogeneously incorporated and {{little is known about the}} effect on protein function and stability. We heterogeneously incorporated UAAs into the nAChR and detected changes in function by shifts in EC 50. Many UAAs altered the function of the nAChR. Incorporation <b>of</b> photo-reactive <b>UAAs</b> allowed for detection of cross-linking by Western blot. Heterogeneously incorporated UAAs also altered the functional nAChR expression on the surface of oocytes. Site-specific and heterogeneous incorporation <b>of</b> multiple <b>UAAs</b> are useful techniques for novel experiments to explore protein function, FRET experiments, cross-linking, and protein expression...|$|R

30|$|Although the {{site-specific}} {{substitution of}} AAs with rare AAs, such as Cys or Tyr, provides multiple {{options for the}} covalent functionalization of proteins, {{it is possible to}} damage the folding or function of the proteins when the genetic modifications for such chemical conjugations become too extensive. The incorporation <b>of</b> <b>UAAs</b> into proteins allows for greater flexibility in protein modifications. Unlike the natural AA residues, these UAAs can contain entirely unique reactive moieties, such as azide, cyano, iodo, bromo, boc, and dansyl groups, and thereby afford completely bioorthogonal reactivity that can occur inside of living systems without interfering with native biochemical processes. The site-specific incorporation (SSI) <b>of</b> <b>UAAs</b> utilizes nonsense codons to incorporate one or a few UAAs into a single or multiple defined locations in a protein. The amber stop codon suppression is commonly employed, in which the target-location codon is mutated to an amber stop codon [219]. To incorporate the UAA, a tRNA and aminoacyl tRNA-synthetase (aaRS) are engineered to pair with the UAA and recognize the amber codon as a sense codon. SSI substitutes a natural AA with an unnatural analog, where the endogenous aminoacyl tRNA-synthetase (aaRS) accepts the UAA and aminoacylates the appropriate tRNA with the UAA. Incubating an auxotrophic expression host in culture media containing the analog <b>UAA</b> instead <b>of</b> the specific natural AA leads to UAA incorporation at nearly every location where the specific natural AA would have been incorporated [220]. The SSI <b>of</b> <b>UAAs</b> has been further extended to CFPS systems [219, 221]. The incorporation <b>of</b> multiple different <b>UAAs</b> has been achieved by the extension of codon-anticodon pairs using a different four-base codon for each tRNA [222]. Technology using acylating ribozyme (flexizyme) instead of ssRS has been developed for in vitro semi-enzymatic synthesis and acylation [223]. Therefore, SSI is minimally invasive and allows the incorporation <b>of</b> any <b>UAA</b> into a specific site of a protein with minor effects.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The T cell {{receptor}} (TCR) -cluster of differ-entiation 3 (CD 3) signaling complex {{plays an important}} role in initiation of adaptive immune responses, but weak interactions have obstructed delineation of the individual TCR-CD 3 subunit interactions during T cell signaling. Here, we demonstrate that unnatural amino acids (UAA) can be used to photo-cross-link subunits of TCR-CD 3 on the cell surface. Incorporating UAA in mammalian cells is usually a low efficiency process. In addition, TCR-CD 3 is composed of eight subunits and both TCR and CD 3 chains are required for expression on the cell surface. Photo-cross-linking <b>of</b> <b>UAAs</b> for studying protein complexes such as TCR-CD 3 is challenging due to the difficulty of transfecting and expressing multisubunit protein complexes in cells combined with the low efficiency <b>of</b> <b>UAA</b> incorporation. Here, we demonstrate that by systematic optimization, we can incorporate UAA in TCR-CD 3 with high efficiency. Accordingly, the incorporated UAA can be used for site-specific photo-cross-linking experiments to pinpoint protein interaction sites, as well as to confirm interaction sites identifie...|$|R
