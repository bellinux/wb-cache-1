5|$|How much {{braking force}} {{to apply to}} each wheel depends both on ground {{conditions}} and on the balance of weight on the wheels at each instant in time. The total braking force cannot exceed the gravity force on the rider and bike times the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>friction</b> µ of the tire on the ground. mgµ >= Ff + Fr. A skid occurs if the ratio of either Ff over Nf or Fr over Nr is greater than µ, with a rear wheel skid having less of {{a negative impact on}} lateral stability.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of views on the {{potential}} uses of Type I and II fluids. The use of Type I fluid raises concern because its holdover time is shorter than the holdover time for Type II fluid under certain conditions. Both fluids are under scrutiny for their environmental impacts, and it is uncertain if Type II fluid diminishes the runway <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>friction</b> since the fluid rolls off the airplane during the takeoff roll. Also, the use of either type fluid may result in a temporary degradation in the airplane's aerodynamic performance, a reduced stall margin, and an increase in drag.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, if {{the center of}} mass height is behind or below the line, such as on most tandem {{bicycles}} or long-wheel-base recumbent bicycles, as well as cars, it is less likely that the front wheel can generate enough braking force to flip the bike. This means they can decelerate up to nearly the limit of adhesion of the tires to the road, which could reach 0.8 g if the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>friction</b> is 0.8, which is 40% more than an upright bicycle under even the best conditions. Bicycling Science author David Gordon Wilson points out that this puts upright bicyclists at particular risk of causing a rear-end collision if they tailgate cars.|$|E

30|$|We {{introduced}} closed-form symbolic expressions for {{the possibility}} distributions <b>of</b> the <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>friction</b> during the tightening process of bolted joints. This relieves the engineer from the burden of propagating the uncertainties through the computations to obtain the uncertain output. The parameters in the distribution functions can be identified by a standardized fastener testing system according to ISO 16047 as has been demonstrated in this paper. An uncertainty analysis also revealed that {{the total amount of}} uncertainty in the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> bearing <b>friction</b> is almost 40 % larger than in the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> thread <b>friction.</b> This finding suggests that in practice, {{it is more important to}} control the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> bearing <b>friction</b> than the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> thread <b>friction.</b> The uncertainty analysis also showed that the real value <b>of</b> the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> bearing <b>friction</b> is likely to be about 5 % and the real value <b>of</b> the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> thread <b>friction</b> to be about 1 % higher than the corresponding expected value.|$|R

Rougher surfaces tend to have higher effective values. Both static and kinetic coefficients of friction depend on the pair of surfaces in contact; for a given pair of surfaces, the coefficient of static friction is usually larger than that of kinetic friction; in some sets the two coefficients are equal, such as teflon-on-teflon.|$|E

25|$|Many {{thermoplastic}} {{materials such as}} nylon, HDPE and PTFE are commonly used in low friction bearings.

25|$|A common way {{to reduce}} {{friction}} is by using a lubricant, such as oil, water, or grease, which is placed between the two surfaces, often dramatically lessening the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>friction.</b> The science of friction and lubrication is called tribology.

The sliding mechanisms are discussed by considering mechanical and thermochemical modifications. The PTFE additives provide lowest <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>friction</b> completely stabilising after a transition from mechanically into thermally controlled sliding at 120 A degrees C. The sliding mechanisms and homogeneous transfer films are mainly controlled by plasticisation rather than easy-shear of its lamellar structure that is hindered by fibre reinforcement. Thermoplastic lubricants decrease the mechanical strength and therefore cause deformation and highest wear rates under 200 N. Internal oil lubricants do not reduce <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>friction</b> at mild to intermediate normal loads and sliding velocities, while they become most efficient at severe sliding conditions, augmenting the pv-limit.

40|$|Reciprocating sliding {{friction}} experiments in humid air and in dry nitrogen and unidirectional {{sliding friction}} experiments in ultrahigh vacuum {{were conducted with}} a natural diamond pin in contact with microwave-plasma-deposited diamond films. Diamond films with a surface roughness (R rms) ranging from 15 to 160 nm were produced by microwave-plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition. In humid air and in dry nitrogen, abrasion occurred when the diamond pin made grooves in the surfaces of diamond films, and thus the initial <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>friction</b> increased with increasing initial surface roughness. The equilibrium <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>friction</b> were independent <b>of</b> the initial surface roughness of the diamond films. In vacuum the friction for diamond films contacting a diamond pin arose primarily from adhesion between the sliding surfaces. In these cases, the initial and equilibrium <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>friction</b> were independent <b>of</b> the initial surface roughness of the diamond films. The equilibrium <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>friction</b> were 0. 02 to 0. 04 in humid air and in dry nitrogen, but 1. 5 to 1. 8 in vacuum.

25|$|A {{variety of}} glide waxes are {{tailored}} for specific temperature ranges and other snow properties with varying wax hardness and other properties that address repellence of moisture and dirt. The hardness of the glide wax affects the melting {{of the snow}} to lubricate its passage over the surface {{and its ability to}} avoid suction from meltwater in the snow. Too little melting and sharp edges of snow crystals or too much suction impede the passage of the ski. A tipping point between where crystal type dominates sliding friction and moisture content dominates occurs around 26°F. Harder waxes address colder, drier or more abrasive snow conditions, whereas softer waxes have a lower <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>friction,</b> but abrade more readily. Wax formulations combine three types of wax to adjust <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>friction</b> and durability. From hard to soft, they include synthetic waxes with 50 or more carbon atoms, microcrystalline waxes with 25 to 50 carbon atoms and paraffin waxes with 20 to 35 carbon atoms. Additives to such waxes include graphite, teflon, silicon, fluorocarbons, and molybdenum to improve glide and/or reduce dirt accumulation.|$|E

25|$|The {{work done}} by {{friction}} can translate into deformation, wear, and heat that can affect the contact surface properties (even the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>friction</b> between the surfaces). This can be beneficial as in polishing. The work of friction is used to mix and join materials {{such as in the}} process of friction welding. Excessive erosion or wear of mating sliding surfaces occurs when work due to frictional forces rise to unacceptable levels. Harder corrosion particles caught between mating surfaces in relative motion (fretting) exacerbates wear of frictional forces. Bearing seizure or failure may result from excessive wear due to work of friction. As surfaces are worn by work due to friction, fit and surface finish of an object may degrade until it no longer functions properly.|$|E
25|$|As {{the angle}} of bank θ {{approaches}} 90°, the tangent function approaches infinity, allowing larger values for |v|2/r. In words, this equation states that for faster speeds (bigger |v|) the road must be banked more steeply (a larger value for θ), and for sharper turns (smaller r) the road also must be banked more steeply, which accords with intuition. When the angle θ does not satisfy the above condition, the horizontal component of force exerted by the road does not provide the correct centripetal force, and an additional frictional force tangential to the road surface is called upon to provide the difference. If friction cannot do this (that is, the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>friction</b> is exceeded), the ball slides to a different radius where the balance can be realized.|$|E
25|$|Most dry {{materials}} in combination have friction coefficient values between 0.3 and 0.6. Values outside this range are rarer, but teflon, for example, {{can have a}} coefficient as low as 0.04. A value of zero would mean no friction at all, an elusive property. Rubber in contact with other surfaces can yield friction coefficients from 1 to 2. Occasionally it is maintained that µ is always < 1, {{but this is not}} true. While in most relevant applications µ < 1, a value above 1 merely implies that the force required to slide an object along the surface is greater than the normal force of the surface on the object. For example, silicone rubber or acrylic rubber-coated surfaces have a <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>friction</b> that can be substantially larger than 1.|$|E
