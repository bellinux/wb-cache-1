40|$|The {{presence}} of a very small amount of high molecular weight polymer significantly delays the pinch-off singularity of {{a drop of water}} falling from a faucet, and leads to the formation of a long-lived <b>cylindrical</b> <b>filament.</b> In this paper we present experiments, numerical simulations, and theory which examines the pinch-off process in the {{presence of}} polymers. The numerical simulations are found to be in excellent agreement with experiment. As a test case, we establish the conditions under which a small bead remains on the filament; we find that {{this is due to the}} asymmetry induced by the self-similar pinch-off of the droplet.

40|$|A {{reliable}} {{injection system}} of the widely tunable microtron-based terahertz Free Electron Laser (FEL) has been developed and during last few years provides stable operation of the FEL for users. The system {{is based on the}} long-life thermionic cathode assembly using 2. 5 mm-in diameter monocrystalline LaB 6 emitter, heated by the tungsten <b>cylindrical</b> <b>filament</b> with the power consumption less than 55 W. The cathode emits the macro-pulse current in the range of 1 - 1. 4 A providing operation of the terahertz FEL during more than 1000 h. The cathode assembly is installed {{on the cover of the}} I-type microtron accelerating cavity in location providing an efficient injection for the acceleration with variable number of orbits. This variation widely changes the energy of the electron beam and allows on-the-fly retuning of the FEL in the range of 1 - 3 THz. Pulse-signal system stabilizing the emission current prevents randomized break-downs in the accelerating cavity and decreases fluctuations of the power of the FEL radiation.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the flow {{profile of a}} polymer solution in a thinning capillary bridge. Fluorescent tracer particles with a diameter of 3 μm were used to visualize the flow. The cylindrical shape of the filament introduced strong optical abberations that could be corrected for, {{and we were able}} to characterize the flow in filaments with a thickness ranging from 150 to 30 μm. In the first regime when the filament was still sufficiently large, we used a PIV algorithm to deduce the flow field. At later stages when the number of particles in the observation plane decreased a PTV algorithm was used. The main two results of our measurements are as follows. First, the flow profile at the formation of the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>filament</b> is highly inhomogeneous and there is only flow in the outer parts of the filament. Second, we find that in most parts of the regime, where the temporal radius of the thinning filament can be fitted with an exponential law the flow indeed is purely extensional.

We stabilize the instability of the cusps towards droplet formation by using polymer solutions that inhibit this secondary instability and give rise to long slender <b>cylindrical</b> <b>filaments.</b> We vary the speed of deposition to change the spacing between these filaments.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{instability}} to necking of an initially <b>cylindrical</b> <b>filament</b> of soft glassy material subject to extensional stretching. By numerical simulation {{of the soft}} glassy rheology model and a simplified fluidity model, and by analytical predictions within a highly generic toy description, we show that the mode of instability is set {{by the age of}} the sample relative to the inverse of the applied extensional strain rate. Young samples neck gradually via a liquid-like mode, the onset of which is determined by both the elastic loading and plastic relaxation terms in the stress constitutive equation. Older samples fail at smaller draw ratios via a more rapid mode, the onset of which is determined only by the solid-like elastic loading terms (though plastic effects arise later, once appreciable necking develops). We show this solid-like mode to be the counterpart, for elastoplastic materials, of the Considère mode of necking in strain-rate-independent solids.

40|$|Observations are {{presented}} of several novel phenomena {{involved in the}} dynamics of a pendant drop of viscoelastic micellar fluid falling through air. Generally, when a drop falls a filament forms connecting it to the orifice; the filament eventually breaks due to an instability. The filament dynamics and instabilities reported here {{are very different from}} the standard Newtonian and non-Newtonian cases. At low surfactant concentration, the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>filament</b> necks down and pinches off rapidly (∼ 10 ms) at one location along the filament. After pinch-off, the free filament ends retract and no satellite drops are produced. At higher concentrations, the pinch-off also occurs along the filament, but in a more gradual process (∼ 1 s). Furthermore, the free filament ends do not fully retract, instead retaining some of their deformation. The falling drop is also observed to slow or even stop (stall) before pinch-off, indicating that sufficient elastic stress has built up to balance its weight. We investigate this stall by generalizing Keiller’s simple model for filament motion [J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 42 (1992) 37], using instead the FENE-CR constitutive equation. Numerical simulations of this model indicate that stall occurs in the range of low solvent viscosity, high elasticity, and high molecular weight. At the highest concentrations, we observe a surface “blistering ” instability along the filament long before pinch-off occurs...|$|E

40|$|A eukaryote-type actin and its binding protein profilin encoded on a genomic {{island in}} the {{cyanobacterium}} Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806 co-localize to form a hollow, spherical enclosure occupying a considerable intracellular space as shown by in vivo fluorescence microscopy. Biochemical and biophysical characterization reveals key differences between these proteins and their eukaryotic homologs. Small-angle X-ray scattering shows that the actin assembles into elongated, filamentous polymers which can be visualized microscopically with fluorescent phalloidin. Whereas rabbit actin forms thin <b>cylindrical</b> <b>filaments</b> about 100 µm in length, cyanobacterial actin polymers resemble a ribbon, arrest polymerization at 5 - 10 µm and tend to form irregular multi-strand assemblies. While eukaryotic profilin is a specific actin monomer binding protein, cyanobacterial profilin shows the unprecedented property of decorating actin filaments. Electron micrographs show that cyanobacterial profilin stimulates actin filament bundling and stabilizes their lateral alignment into heteropolymeric sheets from which the observed hollow enclosure may be formed. We hypothesize that adaptation to the confined space of a bacterial cell devoid of binding proteins usually regulating actin polymerization in eukaryotes has driven the co-evolution of cyanobacterial actin and profilin, giving rise to an intracellular entity...|$|R

We identify ∼ 260, 000 LRG pairs in the DR 12 catalog that lie within 6 - 10 h^- 1 Mpc {{of each other in}} tangential direction and within 6 h^- 1 Mpc in radial direction. We stack pairs by rotating and scaling the angular positions of each LRG so they lie on a common reference frame, then we subtract a circularly symmetric halo from each member of the pair to search for a residual signal between the pair members. We find a statistically significant (5. 3 σ) signal between LRG pairs in the stacked data with a magnitude Δ y = (1. 31 ± 0. 25) × 10 ^- 8. The uncertainty is estimated from two Monte Carlo null tests which also establish the reliability of our analysis. Assuming a simple, isothermal, <b>cylindrical</b> <b>filament</b> model of electron over-density with a radial density profile proportional to r_c/r (as determined from simulations), where r is the perpendicular distance from the cylinder axis and r_c is the core radius of the density profile, we constrain the product of over-density and filament temperature to be δ_c × (T_ e/ 10 ^ 7 K) × (r_c/ 0. 5 h^- 1 Mpc) = 2. 7 ± 0. 5.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of drop formation and pinch-off {{have been investigated}} {{for a series of}} low viscosity elastic fluids possessing similar shear viscosities, but differing substantially in elastic properties. On initial approach to the pinch region, the viscoelastic fluids all exhibit the same global necking behavior that is observed for a Newtonian fluid of equivalent shear viscosity. For these low viscosity dilute polymer solutions, inertial and capillary forces form the dominant balance in this potential flow regime, with the viscous force being negligible. The approach to the pinch point, which corresponds to the point of rupture for a Newtonian fluid, is extremely rapid in such solutions, with the sudden increase in curvature producing very large extension rates at this location. In this region the polymer molecules are significantly extended, causing a localized increase in the elastic stresses, which grow to balance the capillary pressure. This prevents the necked fluid from breaking off, as would occur in the equivalent Newtonian fluid. Alternatively, a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>filament</b> forms in which elastic stresses and capillary pressure balance, and the radius decreases exponentially with time. A (0 + 1) -dimensional finitely extensible nonlinear elastic dumbbell theory incorporating inertial, capillary, and elastic stresses is able to capture the basic features of the experimental observations. Before the critical "pinch time" t(p), an inertial-capillary balance leads to the expected 2 / 3 -power scaling of the minimum radius with time: R-min similar to(t(p) -t) (2 / 3). However, the diverging deformation rate results in large molecular deformations and rapid crossover to an elastocapillary balance for times t>t(p). In this region, the filament radius decreases exponentially with time R-min similar to exp[(t(p) -t) /lambda(1) ], where lambda(1) is the characteristic time constant of the polymer molecules. Measurements of the relaxation times of polyethylene oxide solutions of varying concentrations and molecular weights obtained from high speed imaging of the rate of change of filament radius are significantly higher than the relaxation times estimated from Rouse-Zimm theory, even though the solutions are within the dilute concentration region as determined using intrinsic viscosity measurements. The effective relaxation times exhibit the expected scaling with molecular weight but with an additional dependence on the concentration of the polymer in solution. This is consistent with the expectation that the polymer molecules are in fact highly extended during the approach to the pinch region (i. e., prior to the elastocapillary filament thinning regime) and subsequently as the filament is formed they are further extended by filament stretching at a constant rate until full extension of the polymer coil is achieved. In this highly extended state, intermolecular interactions become significant, producing relaxation times far above theoretical predictions for dilute polymer solutions under equilibrium conditions.

40|$|This project studied {{femtosecond}} laser filamentation from orbital altitudes. In particular, a theoretical and numerical {{model of the}} downward vertical propagation of intense {{femtosecond laser}} pulses launched from an orbital altitude of 400 km was developed. The project's goal was to gain insights {{on the impact of}} initial parameters on the filament formation. Laser filamentation, resulting from the nonlinear propagation of intense ultrashort laser pulses in the atmosphere, has become a promising tool in various fields such as the remote sensing of pollutants using Lidar technology, wireless power transmission, electric field mapping of thunderstorms, and propulsion [1 - 2]. In this technique, femtosecond laser pulses in the terawatt optical power range propagate in the atmosphere behaving as quasi-solitons thanks to a dynamic competition between the optical Kerr effect focusing the beam and the induced plasma effect defocusing the beam. This results in the formation of thin filaments where efficient nonlinear phenomena take place, including self-phase modulation leading to the generation of a coherent broadband continuum spanning from 300 nm to 14 μm [3]. This phenomenon could be of interest for Lidar systems. The white-light continuum generated from femtosecond filamentation can provide additional information about water vapour and temperature profiles, enabling the direct measurement of relative humidity, and can simultaneously acquire multispectral Lidar information using a single laser source. Ground-based white-light lidar has been demonstrated recently by firing TW laser pulses in the atmosphere and measuring the backscattered white-light using a telescope and a few detectors and spectrometers [4 - 6]. Furthermore, laser filamentation can also deliver strong optical intensities at kilometric distances in a self-focused optical beam and can guide microwave radiation along induced-plasma channels for wireless power transmission applications [7]. This project studied the remote generation of laser filamentation in the lower atmosphere from orbital altitudes. In this activity the state-of-the-art theory on self-focusing, filamentation and collapse has been extended to long-distance propagation of ultrashort laser pulses in a stratified atmosphere. The model consists of a unidirectional propagation equation with a medium's response model and includes diffraction laws, optical Kerr effect, plasma defocusing, multispecies ionisation and multiphoton absorption. Propagation in the stratified atmosphere was taken into account via an air density profile depending on the molecule type and altitude profile. Supercontinuum generation was studied by adding the temporal dimension to the simulations, accounting for group velocity dispersion in air and the resulting spectral broadening. This work has not only demonstrated {{for the first time that}} via an extension of state-of-the-art models, the remote generation of laser filamentation was possible from orbital altitudes; it also showed that the general parameters (e. g. power level, mass, size) of such a space system would be within the reach of current technological capabilities, thus opening the field for a range of novel applications. It would e. g. lead to a better retrieval of cloud and aerosol size distributions or a simultaneous retrieval of various trace gas profiles using a single laser source, with the added benefit of robust propagation through adverse atmospheric conditions.

We develop a model of this process that describes the simultaneous visco-elasto-capillary thinning, stretching and drying of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>filaments</b> of polymer solutions. A one dimensional formulation is developed using a slender body approximation to the inertialess equations of motion. The evolution in the kinematics, stress and composition of differential material elements are computed by numerical simulation using an explicit Eulerian scheme. The polymer rheology is described by a single mode Giesekus model with a concentration-dependent shift factor that accounts for compositional dependence of the zero shear rate viscosity and the relaxation time of the fluid. An averaged mass transfer coefficient accounts for evaporation by conduction. The numerical simulations are compared to capillary break-up extensional rheometer (CABER) experiments and stretching experiments using high molecular weight poly(methyl methacrylate) solutions in chlorobenzene with a range of mass fractions in the concentrated regime. Very large reductions in the radius of the thinning thread - spanning two to three orders of magnitude - are attainable by careful control of the mass transfer rate and the stretching/thinning dynamics. (cont.) Simulations show that the fiber formation process can be conveniently parameterized by three dimensionless groups which compare, respectively, the rate of capillary thinning, the rate of elastic stress relaxation, the rate of stretching and the rate of solvent evaporation.

40|$|In Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, {{interactions}} between water molecules and graphitic surfaces are often modeled {{as a simple}} Lennard-Jones potential between oxygen and carbon atoms. A possible method for tuning this parameter consists of simulating a water nanodroplet on a flat graphitic surface, measuring the equilibrium contact angle, extrapolating it to the limit of a macroscopic droplet and finally matching this quantity to experimental results. Considering recent evidence demonstrating that the contact angle of water on a graphitic plane {{is much higher than}} what was previously reported, we estimate the oxygen-carbon interaction for the recent SPC/Fwwater model. Results indicate a value of about 0. 2 kJ/mol, much lower than previous estimations. We then perform simulations of <b>cylindrical</b> water <b>filaments</b> on graphitic surfaces, in order to compare and correlate contact angles resulting from these two different systems. Results suggest that modified Young's equation does not describe the relation between contact angle and drop size in the case of extremely small systems and that contributions different from the one deriving from contact line tension should be taken into account.

40|$|Amphiphilic {{molecules}} are {{well-known for}} their ability to self-assemble in water to form structures such as micelles and vesicles. In comparison, much less is known about amphiphilic self-assembly in nonpolar organic liquids. Such "reverse" self assembly can produce many of the counterparts to structures found in water. In this dissertation, we focus on the formation and dynamics of such reverse structures. We seek to obtain fundamental insight into the driving forces for reverse self-assembly processes. Three specific types of reverse structures are studied: (a) reverse wormlike micelles, i. e., long, flexible micellar chains; (b) reverse vesicles, i. e., hollow containers enclosed by reverse bilayers; and (c) organogel networks. While our focus is on the fundamentals, we note that reverse structures can be useful in a variety of applications ranging from drug delivery, controlled release, hosts for enzymatic reactions, and templates for nanomaterials synthesis. In {{the first part of this}} study, we describe a new route for forming reverse wormlike micelles in nonpolar organic liquids. This route involves the addition of trace amounts of a bile salt to solutions of the phospholipid, lecithin. We show that bile salts, due to their unique "facially amphiphilic" structure, can promote the aggregation of lecithin molecules into these reverse micellar chains. The resulting samples are viscoelastic and show interesting rheological properties. Unusual trends are seen in the temperature dependence of their rheology, which indicates the importance of hydrogen-bonding interactions in the formation of these micelles. Another remarkable feature of their rheology is the presence of strain-stiffening, where the material becomes stiffer at high deformations. Strain-stiffening has been seen before for elastic gels of biopolymers; here, we demonstrate the same properties for viscoelastic micellar solutions. The second reverse aggregate we deal with is the reverse vesicle. We present a new route for forming stable unilamellar reverse vesicles, and this involves mixing short- and long-chain lipids (lecithins) with a trace of sodium chloride. The ratio of the short to long-chain lipid controls the type and size of self-assembled structure formed, and as this ratio is increased, a transition from reverse micelles to vesicles occurs. The structural changes can be explained in terms of molecular geometry, with the sodium chloride acting as a "glue" in binding lipid headgroups together through electrostatic interactions. The final part of this dissertation focuses on organogels. The two-tailed anionic surfactant, AOT, is well-known to form spherical reverse micelles in organic solvents. We have found that trace amounts (e. g., less than 1 mM) of the dihydroxy bile salt, sodium deoxycholate (SDC) can transform these dilute micellar solutions into self-supporting, transparent organogels. The structure and rheology of these organogels is reminiscent of the self-assembled networks formed by proteins such as actin in water. The organogels are based on networks of long, rigid, <b>cylindrical</b> <b>filaments,</b> with SDC molecules stacked together in the filament core...|$|R

A tuft of short <b>cylindrical</b> branchial <b>filaments</b> occurs on each body-ring and the bristles of the ventral fascicles are not bifurcated, but provided with a hooklike bend tip, whereas the dorsal ones are partly capillary, partly stout, with serrations, having the shape of an Y. It was based on a badly preserved specimen, of which the locality was unknown, but in 1902 Collin mentioned it in his »Verzeichniss der von Prof. Semon bei Amboina und Thursday Island gesammelten Polychäten” 2), however without giving any peculiarity about the specimen he examined. A year later 1903, Fischli published an account of the »Polychäten von Ternate”, collected by Kükenthal 1); among them he described and figured a new species, Amphinome sericata. characterized by the presence of a caruncle consisting of a median axis and 8 lateral folded lamellae, whereas the dorsal bristle-fascicle shows the particular harpoon-like setae above referred to. It appears to me to be without doubt, that this worm must be identified with my Pherecardia lobata, and I cannot very well understand how the author could range this annelid in the genus Amphinome, that has a small, faintly developed caruncle and branchiae which only commence on the 3 rd or 4 th segment...|$|R
40|$|Transverse {{oscillations}} {{of solar}} filament and prominence threads have been frequently reported. These oscillations have the common features of being of short period (2 - 10 min) and being damped {{after a few}} periods. Kink magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave modes have been proposed as responsible for the observed oscillations, whereas resonant absorption in the Alfven continuum and ion-neutral collisions are the best candidates to be the damping mechanisms. Here, we study both analytically and numerically the time damping of kink MHD waves in a <b>cylindrical,</b> partially ionized <b>filament</b> thread embedded in a coronal environment. The thread model is composed of a straight and thin, homogeneous filament plasma, with a transverse inhomogeneous transitional layer where the plasma physical properties vary continuously from filament to coronal conditions. The magnetic field is homogeneous and parallel to the thread axis. We find that the kink mode is efficiently damped by resonant absorption for typical wavelengths of filament oscillations, the damping times being compatible with the observations. Partial ionization {{does not affect the}} process of resonant absorption, and the filament plasma ionization degree is only important for the damping for wavelengths much shorter than those observed. To our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that the phenomenon of resonant absorption is studied in a partially ionized plasma. Comment: Submitted in Ap...|$|R
40|$|We {{solve the}} free {{boundary}} {{problem for the}} dynamics of a <b>cylindrical,</b> axisymmetric viscoelastic <b>filament</b> stretching in a gravity-driven extensional flow for the Upper Convected Maxwell and Oldroyd-B constitutive models. Assuming the axial stress in the filament has a spatial dependence provides the simplest coupling of viscoelastic effects to {{the motion of the}} filament, and yields a closed system of ODEs with an exact solution for the stretch rate and filament thickness satisfied by both constitutive models. This viscoelastic solution, which is a generalization of the exact solution for Newtonian filaments, converges to the Newtonian power-law scaling as t → ∞. Based on the exact solution, we identify two regimes of dynamical behavior called the weakly- and strongly-viscoelastic limits. We compare the viscoelastic solution to measurements of the thinning filament that forms behind a falling drop for several semi-dilute (strongly-viscoelastic) polymer solutions. We find the exact solution correctly predicts the time-dependence of the filament diameter in all of the experiments. As t → ∞, observations of the filament thickness follow the Newtonian scaling 1 /√t. The transition from viscoelastic to Newtonian scaling in the filament thickness is coupled to a stretch-to-coil transition of the polymer molecules. © 2004 Cambridge University Press...|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{chirality}} frustrates the two-dimensional {{assembly of}} filamentous molecules, {{a fact that}} reflects the generic impossibility of imposing a global twisting of layered materials. We explore {{the consequences of this}} frustration for hexagonally-ordered assemblies of chiral filaments that are finite in lateral dimension. Specifically, we employ a continuum-elastic description of <b>cylindrical</b> bundles of <b>filaments,</b> allowing us to consider the most general resistance to and preference for chiral ordering of the assembly. We explore two distinct mechanisms by which chirality at the molecular scale of the filament frustrates the assembly into aggregates. In the first, chiral interactions between filaments impart an overall twisting of filaments around the central axis of the bundle. In the second, we consider filaments that are inherently helical in structure, imparting a writhing geometry to the central axis. For both mechanisms, we find that a thermodynamically-stable state of dispersed bundles of finite width appears close to, but below, the point of bulk filament condensation. The range of thermodynamic stability of dispersed bundles is sensitive only to the elastic cost and preference for chiral filament packing. The self-limited assembly of chiral filaments has particular implications for a large class of biological molecules [...] DNA, filamentous proteins, viruses, bacterial flagella [...] which are universally chiral and are observed to form compact bundles under a broad range of conditions.

40|$|In tokamak fusion plasmas, {{coherent}} {{fluctuations in}} the form of blobs or filaments are routinely observed in the scrape-off layer. Radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic waves, excited by antenna structures placed near the wall of a tokamak, have to propagate through the scrape-off layer before reaching the core of the plasma. While the effect of fluctuations on the properties of RF waves has not been quantified experimentally, it is of interest to carry out a theoretical study to determine if fluctuations can affect the propagation characteristics of RF waves. Usually, the difference between the plasma density inside the filament and the background plasma density is sizable, the ratio of the density difference to the background density being of order one. Generally, this precludes the use of geometrical optics in determining the effect of fluctuations, since the relevant ratio has to be much less than one, typically, of the order of 10 % or less. In this paper, a full-wave, analytical model is developed for the scattering of a RF plane wave by a <b>cylindrical</b> plasma <b>filament.</b> It is assumed that the plasma inside and outside the filament is cold and uniform and that the major axis of the filament is aligned along the toroidal magnetic field. The ratio of the density inside the filament to the density of the background plasma is not restricted. The theoretical framework applies to the scattering of any cold plasma wave. In order to satisfy the boundary conditions at the interface between the filament and the background plasma, the electromagnetic fields inside and outside the filament need to have the same k[subscript ∥], the wave vector parallel to the ambient magnetic field, as the incident plane wave. Consequently, in contrast to the scattering of a RF wave by a spherical blob [Ram et al., Phys. Plasmas 20, 056110 - 1 – 056110 - 10 (2013) ], the scattering by a field-aligned filament does not broaden the k∥ spectrum. However, the filament induces side-scattering leading to surface waves and can also couple some power to the cold plasma wave different from the incident wave. The changes induced by a filament in the propagation of electron cyclotron waves and lower hybrid waves are illustrated by numerical results displaying the properties of the Poynting vector. The Poynting flux {{in the wake of the}} filament, and directed towards the core of the plasma, develops a spatial structure due to diffraction and shadowing. Thus, the fluctuations affect the uniformity of power flow into the plasma. United States. Department of Energy (Grant DE-FG 02 - 91 ER- 54109) United States.
