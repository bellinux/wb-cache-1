40|$|Traditional <b>Chinese</b> <b>medicines</b> {{have been}} used in the Chinese {{population}} for the treatment of bone diseases and to promote bone healing for thousands of years. Some traditional <b>Chinese</b> <b>medicines</b> have shown therapeutic effects on fracture healing in clinical and animal studies.

40|$|Abstract: In this experiment, we {{investigate}} the biochemical effects of traditional <b>Chinese</b> <b>medicines</b> via an in vitro bone cell culture. Ten different <b>Chinese</b> <b>medicines</b> {{were used in}} this study. The rat osteoblast-osteoclast co-culture system {{was used as the}} experimental model. After the cells grew to 80 % confluence, various tested materials were added. The mitochondria activity of the bone cells after exposure to various preparations of <b>Chinese</b> <b>medicines</b> was determined by colorimetric assay. Biochemical markers such as protein content, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and acid phosphatase (ACP) titer were analyzed to evaluate the bone cell activity. When cultured with various <b>Chinese</b> <b>medicines</b> for 24 hours, only four of these ten <b>Chinese</b> <b>medicines</b> had potential beneficial effects on the bone cell culture; and only Drynaria fortunei (Kunze) J. Sm. had a universal beneficial effect on bone cell metabolism. The major beneficial effect of Drynaria fortunei (Kunze) J. Sm. on bone cells is probably mediated by the induction of apoptosis of the osteoclast cell population. Continued study of alterations in gene expression of bone cells caused by <b>Chinese</b> <b>medicines</b> will improve our understanding of bone cell responses to various pharmacological interventions...|$|R
40|$|<b>Chinese</b> <b>medicines</b> {{have long}} history in {{treating}} cancer. With the growing scientific evidence of biomedical researches and clinical trials in cancer therapy, they are increasingly accepted as a complementary and alternative treatment. One of the mechanisms is to induce cancer cell death. Aim. To comprehensively review the publications concerning cancer cell death induced by <b>Chinese</b> <b>medicines</b> {{in recent years and}} provide insights on anticancer drug discovery from <b>Chinese</b> <b>medicines.</b> Materials and Methods. <b>Chinese</b> <b>medicines</b> (including <b>Chinese</b> medicinal herbs, animal parts, and minerals) were used in the study. The key words including “cancer”, “cell death”, “apoptosis”, “autophagy,” “necrosis,” and “Chinese medicine” were used in retrieval of related information from PubMed and other databases. Results. The cell death induced by <b>Chinese</b> <b>medicines</b> is described as apoptotic, autophagic, or necrotic cell death and other types with an emphasis on their mechanisms of anticancer action. The relationship among different types of cell death induced by <b>Chinese</b> <b>medicines</b> is critically reviewed and discussed. Conclusions. This review summarizes that CMs treatment could induce multiple pathways leading to cancer cell death, in which apoptosis is the dominant type. To apply these preclinical researches to clinic application will be a key issue in the future...|$|R

5|$|Mercury in {{the form}} of one of its common ores, cinnabar, is used in various {{traditional}} medicines, especially in traditional <b>Chinese</b> <b>medicine.</b> Review of its safety has found that cinnabar can lead to significant mercury intoxication when heated, consumed in overdose, or taken long term, and can have adverse effects at therapeutic doses, though effects from therapeutic doses are typically reversible. Although this form of mercury appears to be less toxic than other forms, its use in traditional <b>Chinese</b> <b>medicine</b> has not yet been justified, as the therapeutic basis for the use of cinnabar is not clear.|$|E
5|$|Having earlier {{rejected}} the Western-led environmentalist movement, China changed its stance in the 1980s {{and became a}} party to the CITES treaty. By 1993 it had banned the trade in tiger parts, and this diminished the use of tiger bones in traditional <b>Chinese</b> <b>medicine.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Liver {{fibrosis}} is {{a condition}} of abnormal proliferation of connective tissue due to various types of chronic liver injury often caused by viral infection and chemicals.

5|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry has {{roots in the}} apothecary shops of Europe in the 1800s, where pharmacists provided local traditional medicines to customers, which included extracts like morphine, quinine, and strychnine. Therapeutically important drugs like camptothecin (from Camptotheca acuminata, used in traditional <b>Chinese</b> <b>medicine)</b> and taxol (from the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia) were derived from medicinal plants. The Vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, used as anti-cancer drugs, were discovered in the 1950s from the Madagascar periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{mushrooms}} enjoy usage as therapeutics in folk medicines, such as Traditional <b>Chinese</b> <b>medicine.</b> Notable medicinal mushrooms with a well-documented {{history of}} use include Agaricus subrufescens, Ganoderma lucidum, and Ophiocordyceps sinensis.

Specific metabolites, such as polysaccharide-K, ergotamine, and β-lactam antibiotics, are routinely used in clinical medicine. The shiitake mushroom {{is a source of}} lentinan, a clinical drug approved for use in cancer treatments in several countries, including Japan. In Europe and Japan, polysaccharide-K (brand name Krestin), a chemical derived from Trametes versicolor, is an approved adjuvant for cancer therapy.|$|E
