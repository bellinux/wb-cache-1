5|$|Although {{the senate}} could do little short of {{assassination}} and open rebellion to contravene {{the will of}} the emperor, it survived the Augustan restoration and the turbulent Year of Four Emperors to retain its symbolic political <b>centrality</b> during the Principate. The senate legitimated the emperor's rule, and the emperor needed the experience of senators as legates (legati) to serve as generals, diplomats, and administrators. A successful career required competence as an administrator and remaining in favour with the emperor, or over time perhaps multiple emperors.|$|E

The <b>centrality</b> of a father in this novel matches Balzac's own position—not only as mentor to his troubled young secretary, Jules Sandeau, but {{also the fact that}} he had fathered a child, Marie-Caroline Du Fresnay, with his otherwise-married lover, Maria Du Fresnay, who had been his source of {{inspiration}} for Eugénie Grandet.|$|E
30|$|The {{conventional}} betweenness <b>centralities</b> of the nodes 1,  2,  3, and 4 of {{the static}} graph in Fig.  2 a are 6,  10,  6.5, and 6.5, respectively. Although two results look similar, we can observe from the periodic graph that the nodes 3 and 4 {{are much more}} important than the node 1 but the classical betweenness <b>centralities</b> of nodes 3 and 4 are larger than that of node 1 by only 8.3  %. By means of our definition and algorithm, the betweenness <b>centralities</b> of nodes 3 and 4 are larger than that of node 1 by 50  %. Therefore, we strongly believe that our betweenness <b>centralities</b> are better than the classical definition for the 1 -dimensional periodic graph. In the following section, we provide experimental results to prove the above belief.|$|R

5|$|A salient {{feature of}} Buddhist {{philosophy}} which sets it apart from Indian orthodoxy is the <b>centrality</b> {{of the doctrine}} of not-self (Pāli. anatta, Skt. anātman). The Buddha's not-self doctrine sees humans as an impermanent composite of five psychological and physical aspects instead of a single fixed self. In this sense, what is called ego or the self is merely a convenient fiction, an illusion that does not apply to anything real but to an erroneous {{way of looking at the}} ever changing stream of five interconnected aggregate factors. The relationship between these aggregates is said to be one of dependent-arising (pratītyasamutpāda). This means that all things, including mental events, arise co-dependently from a plurality of other causes and conditions. This seems to reject both causal determinist and epiphenomenalist conceptions of mind.|$|E

30|$|Understanding the {{relationship}} between individuals’ social networks and health could help devise public health interventions for reducing incidence of unhealthy behaviors or increasing prevalence of healthy ones. In this context, we explore the co-evolution of individuals’ social network positions and physical activities. We {{are able to do}} so because the NetHealth study at the University of Notre Dame has generated both high-resolution longitudinal social network (e.g., SMS) data and high-resolution longitudinal health-related behavioral (e.g., Fitbit physical activity) data. We examine trait differences between (i) users whose social network positions (i.e., <b>centralities)</b> change over time versus those whose <b>centralities</b> remain stable, (ii) users whose Fitbit physical activities change over time versus those whose physical activities remain stable, and (iii) users whose <b>centralities</b> and their physical activities co-evolve, i.e., correlate with each other over time. We find that <b>centralities</b> of a majority of all nodes change with time. These users do not show any trait difference compared to time-stable users. However, if out of all users whose <b>centralities</b> change with time we focus on those whose physical activities also change with time, then the resulting users {{are more likely to be}} introverted than time-stable users. Moreover, users whose <b>centralities</b> and physical activities both change with time and whose evolving <b>centralities</b> are significantly correlated (i.e., co-evolve) with evolving physical activities are more likely to be introverted as well as anxious compared to those users who are time-stable and do not have a co-evolution relationship. Our network analysis framework reveals several links between individuals’ social network structure, health-related behaviors, and the other (e.g., personality) traits. In the future, our study could lead to development of a predictive model of social network structure from behavioral/trait information and vice versa.|$|R

5|$|In the 17th century, Cluj {{suffered}} from great calamities, suffering from epidemics of the plague and devastating fires. The {{end of this}} century brought the end of Turkish sovereignty, but found the city bereft of much of its wealth, municipal freedom, cultural <b>centrality,</b> political significance and even population. It gradually regained its important position within Transylvania as the headquarters of the Gubernium and the Diets between 1719 and 1732, and again from 1790 until the revolution of 1848, when the Gubernium moved to Nagyszeben (Hermannstadt), present-day Sibiu). In 1791, a group of Romanian intellectuals drew up a petition, known as Supplex Libellus Valachorum, which was sent to the Emperor in Vienna. The petition demanded the equality of the Romanian nation in Transylvania in respect to the other nations (Saxon, Szekler and Hungarian) governed by the Unio Trium Nationum, but it was rejected by the Diet of Cluj.|$|E

Specifically, the proposed method uses the statistics of Degree Cen-tralities and clustering coefficients of networks as a classification criterion. A theoretical justification to this method is also given. In relation to the widely held belief that a social network graph is solely defined by its degree distribution, the novelty of this paper consists in revealing the strong dependence of social networks on Degree <b>Centralities</b> and clustering coefficients, and in using them as minimal information to classify social networks. In addition, exper-imental classification demonstrates a very good performance of the proposed method on real social network data, and validates the hy-pothesis that Degree <b>Centralities</b> and clustering coefficients {{are the only two}} viable independent properties of a social network...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is the {{identification}} of urban <b>centralities</b> and analysis of public transportation supply in these areas, in Goiania. To identify <b>centralities</b> were used some tools, as the Exploratory Analysis of Spatial Variables, statistical analyzes and investigations of outliers. The operationalization of the procedures was performed through the use of Geographic Information Systems focused on four variables: average income, population density, density of public transportation lines and density of public transportation supply. Infographics gathering graphs, statistical summaries and boxplots and thematic maps were generated. Spatial analysis was performed by generating maps of scattering Moran (BoxMap). The results showed <b>centralities</b> with high and low supply of public transportation and, also, allowed to conclude that there is a large gap between mobility policies with policies of urban expansion, on the studied case...|$|R
