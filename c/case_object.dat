5000|$|Unlike in English, a {{separate}} neuter personal pronoun ("it") generally does not exist, but the third-person singular and plural both distinguish masculine from feminine. Also, as described above, case is marked on pronouns {{even though it}} is not usually on nouns, similar to English. As in English, there are forms for nominative case (subject pronouns), oblique <b>case</b> (<b>object</b> pronouns), and genitive case (possessive pronouns); in addition, third-person pronouns distinguish accusative and dative. There is also an additional set of possessive determiners, distinct from the genitive case of the personal pronoun; this corresponds to the English difference between [...] "my, your" [...] and [...] "mine, yours".|$|E
50|$|Note {{also that}} in garbage-collected languages, objects are {{generally}} dynamically allocated (on the heap) {{even if they}} are initially bound to an automatic variable, unlike automatic variables with primitive values, which are typically automatically allocated (on the stack or in a register). This allows the object to be returned from a function ("escape") without being destroyed. However, in some cases a compiler optimization is possible, namely performing escape analysis and proving that escape is not possible, and thus the object can be allocated on the stack; this is significant in Java. In this <b>case</b> <b>object</b> destruction will occur promptly - possibly even during the variable's lifetime (before the end of its scope), if it is unreachable.|$|E
5000|$|Condition {{consumption}} link: A condition consumption link is {{a condition}} link from an object to a process, meaning that if in run-time an object instance exists, then the process precondition is satisfied, the process executes and consumes the object instance. However, if that object instance does not exist, then the process precondition evaluation fails and the control skips the process. Graphically, an arrow with a closed arrowhead pointing from the object to the process with the small letter c (for condition) near the arrowhead shall denote a condition consumption link. The syntax of the condition consumption link OPL sentence is: Process occurs if Object exists, in which <b>case</b> <b>Object</b> is consumed, otherwise Process is skipped.|$|E

50|$|Object storage (also {{known as}} object-based storage) is a {{computer}} data storage architecture that manages data as objects, as opposed to other storage architectures like file systems which manage data as a file hierarchy and block storage which manages data as blocks within sectors and tracks. Each object typically includes the data itself, a variable amount of metadata, and a globally unique identifier. Object storage can be implemented at multiple levels, including the device level (object storage device), the system level, and the interface level. In each <b>case,</b> <b>object</b> storage seeks to enable capabilities not addressed by other storage architectures, like interfaces that can be directly programmable by the application, a namespace that can span multiple instances of physical hardware, and data management functions like data replication and data distribution at object-level granularity.|$|E

Moreover, the object is rarely observed in a canonical frame of reference with respect to orientation (or scale). We propose a method, using Houghvoting for local 3 D features, which is orientation (and scale) invariant...|$|E

In spite of the limitations due to {{the uniqueness of the}} real <b>case</b> <b>object</b> of study, some specific issues dealing with spherical tanks were simultaneously addressed (sloshing, soil–structure interaction, FE modeling), so providing a rational framework for the analysis of such special structures, particularly useful for practical purposes. Whereas the detailed observations may be dependent on the analyzed case study, the broad conclusions, such as the considerations about simplified modeling, sloshing or soil–structure interaction, should apply to many practical cases.|$|E

40|$|In essence, the {{classification}} task consists of associating each <b>case</b> (<b>object,</b> or record) to one class, {{out of a}} set of predefined classes, based on the values of some attributes (called predictor attributes) for the case. There has been a great interest in the area of data mining, in which the general goal is to discover knowledge that is not only correct, but also comprehensible and interesting for the user (Fayyad, Piatetsky-Shapiro, & Smyth, 1996; Freitas & 192 Parpinelli, Lopes and Freitas Lavington, 1998). Hence, the user canunderstand the results producedby the system and combine them with their own knowledge to make a well-informed decision, rather than blindly trusting on a system producing incomprehensible results. In data mining, discovered knowledge is often represented in the form of IFTHEN prediction (or classification) rules, as follows: IF THEN. Th [...] ...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} building relational probabilistic models with an underlying ontology that defines the classes and properties used in the model. Properties in the ontology form random variables when applied to individuals. When an individual {{is not in the}} domain of a property, the corresponding random variable is undefined. If we are uncertain about the types of individuals, we may be uncertain about whether random variables are defined. We discuss how to extend a recent result on reasoning with potentially undefined random variables to the relational <b>case.</b> <b>Object</b> properties may have classes of individuals as their ranges, giving rise to random variables whose ranges vary with populations. We identify and discuss {{some of the issues that}} arise when constructing relational probabilistic models using the vocabulary and constraints from an ontology, and we outline possible solutions to certain problems...|$|E
40|$|Some 20 of ca. 200 verbs of Tura, an Eastern Mande {{language}} of Ivory Coast, contain a derivational suffix |-LA̋|. The primary function of this derivational affix is to {{mark on the}} verb the deletion (or sometimes facultativity) of the argument that is normally obligatorily expressed with the base verb as an oblique <b>case</b> <b>object</b> or an adverbial. This kind of derivation, which I propose to refer to as (locative) deobliquative, is typologically unique. The removal occurs either when the respective argument is referentially indefinite, i. e. it can be rendered with 'somewhere, anywhere', or when it is coreferential with the subject or the direct object. In this paper, I discuss the latter, reflexive locative type of the deobliquative derivation {{by way of a}} detailed comparison of the verb gbíé 'pull (at) somebody, something' and the derived verb gbíéla̋ 'drag somebody, something along, away (on the ground) '...|$|E
40|$|Automotive {{electronic}} systems are becoming safety related causing {{a need for}} more systematic and stringent approaches for demonstrating the functional safety. The safety case consists of an argumentation, supported by evidence, of why the system is safe to operate in a given context. It is dependent on referencing and aggregating information {{which is part of the}} EAST-ADL 2, an architecture description language for automotive embedded systems. This paper explores the possibilities of integrating the safety case metamodel with the EAST-ADL 2, enabling safety case development in close connection to the system model. This is done by including a safety <b>case</b> <b>object</b> in EAST-ADL 2, and defining the external and internal relations. Combined with the support for structured information management and systematic safety/reliability analysis, the EAST-ADL 2 ’s ability to support a safety case is shown and further benefits, as high level of traceability between the safety case and the design information, are identified...|$|E

Therefore, it was gradually left in the age. As the result, the runoff of the population mainly on the young generation to the suburb and decrease of the population and progress of the aging are becoming conspicuous. It is anticipated that this tendency will become further serious in future. It is considered that, therefore, the improvement of the residential environment in slope urban district is urgent. In this study, the Nagasaki Tateyama ward is taken up as a <b>case</b> <b>object,</b> and the remedy of the residential environment in slope urban district is examined. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), as an effective tool for the residential environment assessment, is applied to the examination of this remedy under the complicated situation like the design of city and district planing.
