From the Second World War onwards, reconnaissance pilots took care to avoid creating contrails, varying their altitude as necessary; the Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft was equipped with a mirror to enable the pilot to see if the plane was creating a <b>contrail,</b> and to take action accordingly.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2014 SWOT {{analysis}} by MarketLine, {{in recent history}} Juniper has been focusing on software-defined networking (SDN). It acquired SDN company <b>Contrail</b> Systems in December 2012. The following month Juniper announced its SDN strategy, which included a new licensing model based on usage and new features for the Junos operating system. In February 2013, Juniper released several SDN products, including the application provisioning software, Services Activation Director and the Mobile Control Gateway appliance.|$|E
5|$|From 2010 to September 2011, Juniper made six {{acquisitions}} and invested in eight companies. Often Juniper acquired early-stage startups, developing their technology, than {{selling it to}} pre-existing Juniper clients. Juniper acquired two digital video companies, Ankeena Networks and Blackwave Inc., as well as wireless LAN software company Trapeze Networks. In 2012, Juniper acquired Mykonos Software, which develops security software intended to deceive hackers already within the network perimeter. and a developer of software-defined network controllers, <b>Contrail</b> Systems. In 2014 Juniper acquired the software-defined networking (SDN) company WANDL.|$|E
25|$|Attacking in a {{climbing}} curve {{behind the}} MiG-21's with his AIM-7 guidance radar locked on, Ritchie was given continuous range updates by DeBellevue. With his Phantom barely making enough speed to overtake the targets, Ritchie launched two Sparrows from over four miles away. The firing {{parameters of the}} two shots {{were out of the}} missiles' performance envelope, an attempt to influence the MiGs to turn and thus shorten the range. Both shots not only missed but failed to influence the opponents. Moments later, tracking one MiG visually by the <b>contrail</b> it was making, Ritchie fired his remaining two Sparrows, also at long range. The first missed, but the MiG made a hard turn and actually shortened the range, and was destroyed by the second. Short on fuel, Ritchie elected not to try to pursue the second MiG-21.|$|E
2500|$|In February and March 2014, an {{aircraft}} matching the black triangle description was photographed multiple times over Kansas and Texas in daylight. In February 2014, an amateur photographer Jeff Templin snapped {{pictures of a}} triangular aircraft while photographing wildlife in Kansas. On Mar 10, 2014 Steve Douglass and Dean Muskett photographed a triangular shaped aircraft giving off a long <b>contrail</b> over Amarillo, Texas during daylight. Bill Sweetman, Graham Warwick, and Guy Norris of Aviation Week all agree that [...] "the photos show something real." ...|$|E
2500|$|To reduce optical {{visibility}} {{during daylight}} flights, the B-2 is painted in an anti-reflective paint. The undersides are dark because it flies at high altitudes (...) , {{and at that}} altitude a dark grey painting blends well into the sky. It is speculated to have an upward-facing light sensor which alerts the pilot to increase or reduce altitude to match the changing illuminance of the sky. The original design had tanks for a contrail-inhibiting chemical, but this was replaced in production aircraft by a <b>contrail</b> sensor that alerts the crew when they should change altitude. The B-2 is vulnerable to visual interception at ranges of [...] or less.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 March 1992, near Amarillo, Texas, Steven Douglass {{photographed the}} [...] "donuts on a rope" [...] <b>contrail</b> and linked this {{sighting}} to distinctive sounds. He described the engine noise as: [...] "strange, loud pulsating roar... unique... a deep pulsating rumble that vibrated {{the house and}} made the windows shake... similar to rocket engine noise, but deeper, with evenly timed pulses." [...] In addition to providing the first photographs of the distinctive <b>contrail</b> previously reported by many, {{the significance of this}} sighting was enhanced by Douglass' reports of intercepts of radio transmissions: [...] "Air-to-air communications... were between an AWACS aircraft with the call sign [...] "Dragnet 51" [...] from Tinker AFB, Oklahoma, and two unknown aircraft using the call signs [...] "Darkstar November" [...] and [...] "Darkstar Mike". Messages consisted of phonetically transmitted alphanumerics. It is not known whether this radio traffic had any association with the [...] "pulser" [...] that had just flown over Amarillo." [...] ("Darkstar" [...] is also a call sign of AWACS aircraft from a different squadron at Tinker AFB) A month later, radio enthusiasts in California monitoring Edwards AFB Radar (callsign [...] "Joshua Control") heard early morning radio transmissions between Joshua and a high flying aircraft using the callsign [...] "Gaspipe". [...] "You're at 67,000 feet, 81 miles out" [...] was heard, followed by [...] "70 miles out now, 36,000 ft, above glideslope." [...] As in the past, nothing linked these observations to any particular aircraft or program, but the attribution to the Aurora helped expand the legend.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{a number}} of reasons leading to the {{retirement}} of the A-12, but one major concern was the growing sophistication of Soviet-supplied SAM sites that it had to contend with over mission routes. In 1967, the vehicle was tracked with acquisition radar over North Vietnam, but the SAM site was unsuccessful with the Fan Song guidance radar used to home the missile to the target. [...] On 28 October a North Vietnamese SAM site launched a single, albeit unsuccessful, missile. Photography from this mission documented the event with photographs of missile smoke above the SAM firing site, and with pictures of the missile and of its <b>contrail.</b> Electronic countermeasures equipment appeared to perform well against the missile firing.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Contrail</b> [...] was a Cloud Federation {{computing}} {{project that}} ran from 1 October 2010 until 31 January 2014. <b>Contrail</b> produced open-source cloud stack software including Security, PaaS components, Distributed file system, Application Lifecycle management middleware, and SLA Management. <b>Contrail</b> supports OVF standard and runs on OpenStack and OpenNebula. <b>Contrail</b> software {{is a full}} IaaS + PaaS Cloud stack ready to implement Cloud Federations.|$|E

5000|$|Cirrus clouds {{have been}} {{observed}} to develop after the persistent formation of contrails and {{have been found to}} have a global warming effect over-and-above that of <b>contrail</b> formation alone. There is a degree of scientific uncertainty about the contribution of <b>contrail</b> and cirrus cloud formation to global warming and attempts to estimate aviation's overall climate change contribution do not tend to include its effects on cirrus cloud enhancement. However, a 2015 study found that artificial cloudiness caused by <b>contrail</b> [...] "outbreaks" [...] reduce the difference between daytime and nighttime temperatures. The former are decreased and the latter are increased, in comparison to temperatures the day before and the day after such outbreaks. On days with outbreaks the day/night temperature difference was diminished by about 6F° in the U.S. South and 5F° in the Midwest.|$|E

5000|$|Contrails, or {{condensation}} trails, are [...] "streaks of {{condensed water}} vapor {{created in the}} air by an airplane or rocket at high altitudes." [...] They {{are the result of}} normal emissions of water vapor from piston and jet engines at high altitudes in which the water vapor condenses into visible clouds. They are formed when hot humid air from the engines mixes with the colder surrounding air. The rate at which contrails dissipate is entirely dependent on weather conditions and altitude. If the atmosphere is near saturation, the <b>contrail</b> may exist for some time. Conversely, if the atmosphere is dry, the <b>contrail</b> will dissipate quickly.|$|E
5000|$|Tests {{conducted}} {{that summer}} showed the drone was almost invisible to ground radar, and interceptors that were scrambled {{to find it}} ended up chasing each other. The only {{problem was that the}} drone generated a <b>contrail,</b> which gave it away. A [...] "no-con (no-contrail)" [...] program was initiated to fix the problem in following variants, though apparently it wasn't fitted to the Model 147A. The system injected chlorosulfonic acid into the engine tailpipe when the drone entered hostile territory, which created very tiny ice crystals, forming a transparent <b>contrail.</b> The scheme was effective, although the chlorosulfonic acid was very corrosive, requiring use of high-grade stainless-steel plumbing.|$|E
