40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that besides {{the quality of}} service (QoS), the energy efficiency is also a key parameter in designing and evaluating mobile multimedia <b>communication</b> <b>systems,</b> which has catalyzed great interest in recent literature. In this paper, an energy efficiency model is first proposed for multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) mobile multimedia <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> with statistical QoS constraints. Employing the channel matrix singular-value-decomposition (SVD) method, all subchannels are classified by their channel characteristics. Furthermore, the multi-channel joint optimization problem in conventional MIMO-OFDM <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> {{is transformed into a}} multi-target single channel optimization problem by grouping all subchannels. Therefore, a closed-form solution of the energy efficiency optimization is derived for MIMO-OFDM mobile mlutimedia <b>communication</b> <b>systems.</b> As a consequence, an energy-efficiency optimized power allocation (EEOPA) algorithm is proposed to improve the energy efficiency of MIMO-OFDM mobile multimedia <b>communication</b> <b>systems.</b> Simulation comparisons validate that the proposed EEOPA algorithm can guarantee the required QoS with high energy efficiency in MIMO-OFDM mobile multimedia <b>communication</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{the fifth}} {{generation}} (5 G) wireless <b>communication</b> <b>systems,</b> {{a majority of}} the traffic demands are contributed by various multimedia applications. To support the future 5 G multimedia <b>communication</b> <b>systems,</b> the massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique is recognized as a key enabler because of its high spectral efficiency. The massive antennas and radio frequency chains not only improve the implementation cost of 5 G wireless <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> but also result in an intense mutual coupling effect among antennas because of the limited space for deploying antennas. To reduce the cost, an optimal equivalent precoding matrix with the minimum number of radio frequency chains is proposed for 5 G multimedia massive MIMO <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> considering the mutual coupling effect. Moreover, an upper bound of the effective capacity is derived for 5 G multimedia massive MIMO <b>communication</b> <b>systems.</b> Two antennas that receive diversity gain models are built and analyzed. The impacts of the antenna spacing, the number of antennas, the quality-of-service (QoS) statistical exponent, and the number of independent incident directions on the effective capacity of 5 G multimedia massive MIMO <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> are analyzed. Comparing with the conventional zero-forcing precoding matrix, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed optimal equivalent precoding matrix can achieve a higher achievable rate for 5 G multimedia massive MIMO <b>communication</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

Thus, usability trumps learnability. In addition, the <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> that evolve in larger populations exhibit distinct advantages over those that evolve in smaller populations: the learnability loss (from the Initial signs) is more muted and the usability benefits are more pronounced. The usability benefits for human <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> that evolve in a small and large population is explained through guided variation reducing sign complexity. The enhanced performance of the <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> that evolve in larger populations is explained by the operation of a content bias acting on the larger pool of competing signs.
