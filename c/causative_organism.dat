5|$|Some {{authors have}} {{recommended}} that combinations of cheaper or more cost-effective drugs (such as co-trimoxazole with rifampicin or clindamycin) be tried before linezolid {{in the treatment}} of SSTIs when susceptibility of the <b>causative</b> <b>organism</b> allows it.|$|E
5|$|No {{significant}} difference appears in treatment success rates between linezolid, glycopeptides, or appropriate beta-lactam antibiotics {{in the treatment}} of pneumonia. Clinical guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia developed by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend that linezolid be reserved for cases in which MRSA has been confirmed as the <b>causative</b> <b>organism,</b> or when MRSA infection is suspected based on the clinical presentation. The guidelines of the British Thoracic Society do not recommend it as first-line treatment, but rather as an alternative to vancomycin. Linezolid is also an acceptable second-line treatment for community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia when penicillin resistance is present.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause is}} not entirely clear, but {{is thought to be}} multifactorial. It has even been {{suggested}} that aphthous stomatitis is not a single entity but rather a group of conditions with different causes. Multiple research studies have attempted to identify a <b>causative</b> <b>organism,</b> but aphthous stomatitis appears to be non-contagious, non-infectious and not sexually transmissible. The mucosal destruction is thought {{to be the result of}} a T cell (T lymphocyte) mediated immune response which involves the generation of interleukins and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Mast cells and macrophages are also involved, secreting TNF-α along with the T cells. When early aphthous ulcers are biopsied, the histologic appearance shows a dense inflammatory infiltrate, 80% of which is made up of T cells. Persons with aphthous stomatitis also have circulating lymphocytes which react with peptides 91–105 of heat shock protein 65–60, and the ratio of CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of individuals with aphthous stomatitis is decreased.|$|E

He was also involved in two projects that were not viral, the characterisation of the causative agents of psittacosis and Q fever. After finding that parrots and cockatoos were infected with psittacosis and were responsible for transmission, he lobbied the government for a ban {{in order to prevent}} human infection, but he was rebuffed and later came to agree with the government position that there was not much danger. During the time he worked on Q fever with Australian scientist E.H. Derrick, the <b>causative</b> <b>organism</b> of which was named Coxiella burnetii in Burnet's honour, he became the first person to acquire the disease in the laboratory. His epidemiological studies of herpes and Q fever displayed an appreciation of the ecology of infectious disease that became a characteristic of his scientific method.|$|E
25|$|Epidemic typhus {{is a form}} of typhus {{so named}} because the disease often causes {{epidemics}} following wars and natural disasters. The <b>causative</b> <b>organism</b> is Rickettsia prowazekii, transmitted by the human body louse (Pediculus humanus humanus).|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the <b>causative</b> <b>organisms</b> of respiratory infections from 1989 to 1990 at Mae Sot General Hospital {{in collaboration with}} Chiang Mai University, Thailand. We collected sputum from patient with acute bronchitis and pneumonia to identify the <b>causative</b> <b>organisms</b> by sputum culture and inflammatory sputum cytology. We experienced 72 cases (97 strains of bacteria) of acute broncitis and 17 cases of pneumonia (20 strains of bacteria) in Mae Sot General Hospital. The most frequently identified pathogens in respiratory infections were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Branhamella catarrhalis. This study shows that Gram-stained smears and quantitative sputum culture together have {{a significant role in}} enhancing the diagnostic value of expectorated sputum specimens. The <b>causative</b> <b>organisms</b> between Thailand and Japan were very similar in acute respiratory infections. The most important outcome of this study was the detection of Branhamella catarrhalis in many adult cases with acute respiratory infection...|$|R
25|$|If the {{effusion}} {{is caused}} by infection, microbiological culture may yield the infectious organism responsible for the infection, sometimes before other cultures (e.g. blood cultures and sputum cultures) become positive.

25|$|The {{diagnosis}} can {{be confirmed}} by the characteristic appearance of the chest x-ray, which shows widespread pulmonary infiltrates, and an arterial oxygen level (PaO2) that is strikingly lower than would be expected from symptoms. Gallium 67 scans are also useful in the diagnosis. They are abnormal in approximately 90% of cases and are often positive before the chest x-ray becomes abnormal. The diagnosis can be definitively confirmed by histological identification of the <b>causative</b> <b>organism</b> in sputum or bronchio-alveolar lavage (lung rinse). Staining with toluidine blue, silver stain, periodic-acid schiff stain, or an immunofluorescence assay will show the characteristic cysts. The cysts resemble crushed ping-pong balls and are present in aggregates of 2 to 8 (and {{not to be confused}} with Histoplasma or Cryptococcus, which typically do not form aggregates of spores or cells). A lung biopsy would show thickened alveolar septa with fluffy eosinophilic exudate in the alveoli. Both the thickened septa and the fluffy exudate contribute to dysfunctional diffusion capacity which is characteristic of this pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|These {{days there}} is not much disputing that Ixodes holocyclus is the main vector for Rickettsial Spotted Fever (also known as Queensland tick typhus) (<b>causative</b> <b>organism</b> the {{bacteria}} Rickettsia australis) and Flinders Island Spotted Fever (<b>causative</b> <b>organism</b> Rickettsia honei). Rickettsia australis is an obligate, intracellular bacterial parasite that proliferates within the endothelial cells of small blood vessels, causing a vasculitis. Spotted Fever is probably more common than the Lyme-like Disease. Sometimes infection with Rickettsia australis occurs without a rash - there may just be a high fever. Usually (65% of cases) there is a black spot (known as an eschar, usually 2–5mm in diameter) {{at the site of the}} tick bite. This looks like a scab with redness and swelling around it. Usually there is only one eschar unless there has been more than one tick bite. Often lymph glands nearby are enlarged and painful. Fever starts 1–14 days (usually 7–10 days) following the tick bite, followed within a few days by a rash. The rash can look like chicken pox as the spots may contain some fluid. Other symptoms include headache, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, mental confusion, aching muscles and joints. The illness may be more severe in adults and elderly persons. Spotted Fever is diagnosed by two blood tests (IgM and Weil-Felix tests) taken 10 days apart. PCR analysis of skin biopsies is a more recent testing method. The disease runs its course in two weeks or so but can be cured more quickly with antibiotics (tetracyclines). As antibiotic treatment is very effective, many persons feel so well that they do not return to have the second blood sample collected. But this second blood test is important as it is the only way of proving the diagnosis of Spotted Fever. Spotted Fever rarely, if ever, occurs more than once because the body usually becomes immune for life. In rare instances there may be an apparent repeated infection after recovery - it is not known whether this is caused by another strain. It is also presently unknown if chronic infections occur. It is rarely fatal. Australian Spotted Fever was first described in 1946 when 12 soldiers contracted the disease during training exercises in north Queensland - it was at that time known as Queensland Tick Typhus (QTT). Infections generally arise in rural areas, but 10% of reported cases appear to have been acquired in major cities. It is apparently commonly seen in tick collectors in southern Queensland. It mostly occurs during the winter and spring, but can occur at any time in temperate areas.|$|E

40|$|Background: Ventilator {{associated}} pneumonia (VAP) is {{a dynamic}} disease caused by {{a wide spectrum of}} pathogens and associated with morbidity and mortality. Purpose: The study concerned with an analysis of VAP studies done in Egyptian University Hospitals in the last 10  years to describe the magnitude of the problem of VAP as a complication of mechanical ventilation, and to explore its predictors and most common <b>causative</b> <b>organisms.</b> Methods: To identify relevant published studies we searched the medical literature for articles done in Egypt published during the past 10  years, using midline PubMed and Google scholar, where the full text articles were downloaded. We also searched the thesis discussed and passed (Registered) at the website of the Egyptian Universities libraries consortium visiting the website of the supreme council of Egyptian Universities. Results: Most of the 37 studies on which analysis were done were concerned with the risk factors, <b>causative</b> <b>organisms,</b> and incidence. The most common risk factors were leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, high CRP, metabolic acidosis, nasal endotracheal intubation, re-intubation, prior antibiotic use, and contaminated ICU environment with lack of infection control measures, use of antacids and H 2 blocker, corticosteroids use, and coma.
