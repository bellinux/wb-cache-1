5|$|Brezhnev's {{stabilisation}} policy included ending the liberalising reforms of Khrushchev, and clamping down on cultural freedom. During the Khrushchev years, Brezhnev had supported the leader's denunciations of Stalin's arbitrary rule, {{the rehabilitation of}} many of the victims of Stalin's purges, and the cautious liberalisation of Soviet intellectual and <b>cultural</b> <b>policy.</b> But as soon as he became leader, Brezhnev began to reverse this process, and developed an increasingly conservative and regressive attitude.|$|E
5|$|The {{policy was}} relaxed {{somewhat}} {{in the final}} years of occupation (1943–44), in view of German military defeats and the approaching Eastern Front. The Germans hoped that a more lenient <b>cultural</b> <b>policy</b> would lessen unrest and weaken the Polish Resistance. Poles were allowed back into those museums that now supported German propaganda and indoctrination, such as the newly created Chopin museum, which emphasized the composer's invented German roots. Restrictions on education, theater and music performances were eased.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial of}} the writers Yuli Daniel and Andrei Sinyavsky in 1966 — the first such public trials since Stalin's day — marked the {{reversion}} to a repressive <b>cultural</b> <b>policy.</b> Under Yuri Andropov the state security service (in {{the form of the}} KGB) regained some of the powers it had enjoyed under Stalin, although there was no return to the purges of the 1930s and 1940s, and Stalin's legacy remained largely discredited among the Soviet intelligentsia.|$|E

40|$|While {{a crisis}} of {{legitimacy}} currently affects <b>cultural</b> <b>policies,</b> the suggested research paper intends firstly to seek the legitimacy of <b>cultural</b> <b>policies</b> in political philosophy by examining it under the liberal, communitarian and multicultural theories of justice. After showing the impossibility of a position of “cultural neutrality” by the State and, therefore, the impossibility of a purely liberal justification to <b>cultural</b> <b>policies,</b> the paper intends to justify <b>cultural</b> <b>policies</b> {{on the basis of}} dialectic process between communitarianism and multiculturalism in order to reconcile cultural freedom and equality. The paper defends the hypothesis that <b>cultural</b> <b>policies</b> {{can be seen as a}} requirement of justice because of the importance of the diversity of cultural structures as a source of real freedom. But cultural diversity has also been set up as a new function of <b>cultural</b> <b>policies</b> in legal and political discourses, beside the other traditional functions of these policies (democratization of culture, cultural democracy and coalescing citizens around common values). The paper will study this new function of <b>cultural</b> <b>policies</b> and its interaction with the classical ones from the point of view of the political sociology of law and from the legal point of view, in order to identify possibilities of conciliation between them...|$|R

In his résumé, he emphasised his experience as a political organiser and speaker and suggested that a purely military task would not make best use of his knowledge and skills.|$|E

In 1962, Ralea was one of the guest speakers at a Geneva conference on the generation gap, alongside Louis Armand, Claude Autant-Lara, and Jean Piaget. Also that year, he helped with the recovery and reemployment of a former rival, Traian Herseni. Reportedly, Ralea excused Herseni's Iron Guard affiliation as a careerist move rather than a political crime. Together, they published Sociologia succesului ("The Sociology of Success"); Herseni used the pseudonym Traian Hariton.|$|E

25|$|The fall of soviet-style {{communism}} in 1989 elated the cultural world, {{but the experience}} hasn't been an easy one due to problems in the transition period and {{the adoption of a}} free market economy. The discontinuation of state and political control of culture brought about the long dreamt freedom of expression, but, at the same time, the state subsidies also stopped and Romania's culture was seriously affected by the side-effects of the incipient, still very imperfect, free market economy and by inadequate material resources. Culture has had to cope with a variety of problems, one of them being a shift in people's interest towards other areas such as the press and television. The search for a new <b>cultural</b> <b>policy,</b> relying on decentralisation, seems to prevail now. People speak about a crisis of culture in this country, but if there is a crisis of culture, it is only at an institutional level.|$|E

[...] Critics noted in the work a change of idiom, away from the European avant-garde character of much of his prewar music and towards a simpler popular style.
