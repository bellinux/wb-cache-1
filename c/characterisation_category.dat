40|$|Joseph Heller’s novel Catch- 22 (1961) {{details the}} absurdity of war and {{extensively}} makes use of humour to do so. Yet the structural role this characteristic humour fulfils has rarely been explored in depth. In this article, I focus on {{a specific type of}} humour, namely absurdist humour, which is traditionally defined as a form of humour where resolution of the underlying incongruity cannot be obtained. Drawing on cognitive theories of humour and on the concept of <b>characterisation</b> <b>categories,</b> the article goes on to describe the close-knit relationship between absurdist humour and characterisation in the novel. The analysis highlights the structural importance of absurdist humour both for the narrative structure of the novel as well as for a reader’s understanding and interpretation of Catch- 22. The article illustrates that resolution can be achieved, contrary to the generally espoused viewpoint in humour studies, and that it is realised at the moment of interpretation. Understanding the mechanisms of absurdist humour, then, benefits our understanding of Heller’s classic as it forces readers to more closely consider the message conveyed by the novel...|$|R

5000|$|There {{was perhaps}} {{a more direct}} route available: the abelian {{category}} concept had been introduced by Grothendieck in his foundational work on homological algebra, to unify categories of sheaves of abelian groups, and of modules.

This type of definition can be traced back, in one line, to the lattice concept of the 1930s.

40|$|This study reformulates the old {{problem of}} mimesis {{in the spirit}} of pragmatics. It treats {{similarity}} as as a subjective-objective relation. Comparison of the conception of formal mimetism and literature as pretending of actual acts of speech leads to a conclusion on the asymmetry of these two modern applications of the category of mimesis. The first one attempts at restricting its use, the second attempts at globalisation, a kind of which is pragmatisation. Conception of mimesis as pretending strengthens the objective <b>characterisation</b> of <b>categories.</b> The function of convention is emphasised, which determines either the mimetic or referential reading of a text, which becomes particularly important in the reading of documentary and paradocumentary literature where we have to do with a permanent asymmetry of the sender's expectations and of the recipient's reactions. Attempts at defining mimesis in terms of cognitivist theories are conducive to pragmatisation of categories where the mental effects of a literary representation are involved, and the similarity is defined as closeness of a text and perceptual schemes located in the recipient's brain. All these processes lead to the questioning of mimesis as a palpable property {{in the structure of the}} text, stressing the reader's and the reading's role in the constitution of the mimetic effect...|$|R
40|$|A semi-localization of a {{category}} {{is a full}} reflective subcategory with the property that the reflector is semi-left-exact. In this article we first determine an abstract characterization of the categories which are semi-localizations of an exact Mal'tsev category, by specializing a result due to S. Mantovani. We then turn our attention to semi-abelian categories, where a special type of semi-localizations are known to coincide with torsion-free subcategories. A new <b>characterisation</b> of protomodular <b>categories</b> in terms of binary relations is obtained, inspired by the one discovered in the pointed context by Z. Janelidze. This result is useful to obtain an abstract characterization of the torsion-free and of the hereditarily-torsion-free subcategories of semi-abelian categories. Some examples are considered in detail in the categories of groups, crossed modules, commutative rings and topological groups. We finally explain how these results extend similar ones obtained by W.

40|$|We {{define and}} study {{familial}} 2 -functors primarily {{with a view}} {{to the development of the}} 2 -categorical approach to operads of [Weber, 2005]. Also included in this paper is a result in which the well-known <b>characterisation</b> of a <b>category</b> as a simplicial set via the Segal condition, is generalised to a result about nice monads on cocomplete categories. Instances of this general result can be found in [Leinster, 2004], [Berger, 2002] and [Moerdijk-Weiss, 2007 b]. Aspects of this general theory are then used to show that the composite 2 -monads of [Weber, 2005] that describe symmetric and braided analogues of the $omega$-operads of [Batanin, 1998], are cartesian 2 -monads and their underlying endo- 2 -functor is familial. Intricately linked to the notion of familial 2 -functor is the theory of fibrations in a finitely complete 2 -category [Street, 1974] [Street, 1980], and those aspects of that theory that we require, that weren't discussed in [Weber, 2007], are reviewed here. 68 page(s...|$|R
40|$|We study {{categorical}} {{models for}} the unitless fragment of multiplicative linear logic. We find that the appropriate notion of model is {{a special kind of}} promonoidal category. Since the theory of promonoidal categories has not been developed very thoroughly, at least in the published literature, we need to develop it here. The most natural way to do this - and the simplest, once the (substantial) groundwork has been laid - is to consider promonoidal categories as an instance of the general theory of pseudomonoids in a monoidal bicategory. Accordingly, we describe and explain the notions of monoidal bicategory and pseudomonoid therein. The higher-dimensional nature of monoidal bicategories presents serious notational difficulties, since to use the natural analogue of the commutative diagrams used in ordinary category theory would require the use of three-dimensional diagrams. We therefore introduce a novel technical device, which we dub the calculus of components, that simplifies the business of reasoning about a certain class of algebraic structure internal to a monoidal bicategory. When viewed through this simplifying lens, the theory of pseudomonoids turns out to be essentially formally identical to the ordinary theory of monoidal categories. We indicate how the calculus of components may be extended to cover structures that make use of the braiding in a braided monoidal bicategory, and use this to study braided pseudomonoids. A higher-dimensional analogue of Cayley's theorem is proved, and used to deduce a novel characterisation of the unit of a promonoidal category. This, and the other preceding work, is then used to give two <b>characterisations</b> of the <b>categories</b> that model the unitless fragment of intuitionistic multiplicative linear logic. Finally we consider the non-intuitionistic case, where the second characterisation in particular takes a surprisingly simple form. Comment: PhD thesis, University of Manchester, 200...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to: provide a precise <b>characterisation</b> of spatial <b>category</b> {{representations}} in Williams syndrome (WS); to determine the nature of the mechanistic contributions from spatial language performance and non-verbal cognition to spatial category representations in WS; and to explore the stability of spatial category representations in WS using error analysis. Spatial category representation was assessed across nine spatial categories (In, On, Under, In Front, Behind, Above, Below, Left and Right) using an odd-one-out task. The performance of individuals with WS (N= 24; 12; 00 years; months to 30; 07 years; months) was compared to data from typically developing children aged four to seven years (N= 75), published in Farran & Atkinson (2016). The WS group performed at the level of typical 4 - and 5 -year-olds. Despite this low level of ability, they demonstrated typical variation in their representation of easier to harder spatial categories, in line with the spatial category representation model (Farran & Atkinson, 2016). Error analysis of broad category understanding (i. e. category understanding which includes non-prototypical category members), however, showed that errors reflected fewer guess responses than expected by chance in the WS group only, which could suggest strategic responding in this group. Developmental trajectory analyses demonstrated a significant contributing influence of both non-verbal mental age and spatial language in the TD group. For the WS group, non-verbal mental age significantly contributed to spatial category representations, whilst the contributing influence of spatial language ability was marginally significant. With reference to level of ability, spatial category representations in the WS group were consistently lower than would be expected for non-verbal mental age, but on a par with their (low) spatial language mental age. Spatial category representations in WS are discussed with reference to their contribution to the hallmark deficit in spatial construction and drawing abilities in WS...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} Topological Domain Theory as {{a powerful}} and flexible framework for denotational semantics. Topological Domain Theory models {{a wide range of}} type constructions and can interpret many computational features. Furthermore, it has close connections to established frameworks for denotational semantics, as well as to well-studied mathematical theories, such as topology and computable analysis. We begin by describing the categories of Topological Domain Theory, and their categorical structure. In particular, we recover the basic constructions of domain theory, such as products, function spaces, fixed points and recursive types, in the context of Topological Domain Theory. As a central contribution, we give a detailed account of how computational effects can be modelled in Topological Domain Theory. Following recent work of Plotkin and Power, who proposed to construct effect monads via free algebra functors, this is done by showing that free algebras for a large class of parametrised equational theories exist in Topological Domain Theory. These parametrised equational theories are expressive enough to generate most of the standard examples of effect monads. Moreover, the free algebras in Topological Domain Theory are obtained by an explicit inductive construction, using only basic topological and set-theoretical principles. We also give a comparison of Topological and Classical Domain Theory. The category of omega-continuous dcpos embeds into Topological Domain Theory, and we prove that this embedding preserves the basic domain-theoretic constructions in most cases. We show that the classical powerdomain constructions on omega-continuous dcpos, including the probabilistic powerdomain, can be recovered in Topological Domain Theory. Finally, we give a synthetic account of Topological Domain Theory. We show that Topological Domain Theory is a specific model of Synthetic Domain Theory in the realizability topos over Scott's graph model. We give internal <b>characterisations</b> of the <b>categories</b> of Topological Domain Theory in this realizability topos, and prove the corresponding categories to be internally complete and weakly small. This enables us to show that Topological Domain Theory can model the polymorphic lambda-calculus, and to obtain a richer collection of free algebras than those constructed earlier. In summary, this thesis shows that Topological Domain Theory supports a wide range of semantic constructions, including the standard domain-theoretic constructions, computational effects and polymorphism, all within a single setting...|$|R
40|$|This nostalgic yet {{analytic}} article {{discusses the}} topic of aesthetic approach in the aesthetic literature of Soviet Estonia (authors Borev, Kagan, Stolovich and others). Firstly, the aesthetic approach engages man’s creative/reshaping activities {{in relation to the}} world (following Marx’s slogan that ’man also produces in accordance with the laws of beauty’). Secondly, an artistic meaning can be distinguished, followed by a third, the subjective aesthetic meaning, which indicates the actual application of aesthetic categories (such as ’beauty’, ’sublimity’, etc.). Since the subjective aesthetic meaning is fundamental in relation to the other meanings, the article focuses on the specific <b>characterisation</b> of this <b>category.</b> The first important characteristic is the appraisability, which is born from the usage of the categories; the number of categories has been subject to historical change, reflecting the development of man’s aesthetic approach. Aesthetic approach was mainly defined through the five conditions (sensuousness, direct contact with the concrete object, selflessness, and the appraisal of the object in comparison with the ideal). Analysis of the aesthetic approach in a historical dialectic relation to theoretical, utilitarian and ethical approaches indicates that aesthetical feelings only arose {{towards the end of the}} Paleolithic era. Peoples on a lower developmental level didn’t know of aesthetic appraisal, or their aesthetic appraisals were still very closely connected with the utilitaristic. Even though all approaches at times are exhibited in their ‘pure’ forms, Soviet aesthetics generally held to the opinion that they arose simultaneously in daily practice and were intertwined with one another. The societal and practical meanings are what constitute the aesthetic approach – meaning that they define what man will begin to consider beautiful (in its more radical forms, this meant reducing the beauty of an object to its usefulness), but they also affect the nature of existing aesthetic objects. An example typical of that time: relations of private property transforms a beautiful object into its opposite (a beautiful pearl found by a poor fisherman can become an ugly grey nodule due to the afflictions caused by a world ruled by selfishness). In analysing the Soviet aesthetical concept of aesthetic approach and how it differs from the corresponding notion in the ’nations of Western capitalism’, I point to the neutral appraisal of aesthetic approach in Western ethics and the fact that the aesthetic approach has been relatively unaffected by individual/ societal meanings. <br /...|$|R
