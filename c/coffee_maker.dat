As {{a result of}} brewing under high pressure (ideally between 9–10 atm), the espresso beverage is more concentrated (as much as 10 to 15 times the quantity of coffee to water as gravity-brewing methods can produce) and has a more complex physical and chemical constitution. A well-prepared espresso has a reddish-brown foam called crema that floats on the surface. Other pressurized water methods include the moka pot and vacuum <b>coffee</b> <b>maker.</b>|$|E

50|$|A vacuum <b>coffee</b> <b>maker</b> brews coffee {{using two}} {{chambers}} where vapor pressure and vacuum produce coffee. This type of <b>coffee</b> <b>maker</b> {{is also known}} as vac pot, siphon or syphon <b>coffee</b> <b>maker,</b> and was invented by Loeff of Berlin in the 1830s. These devices have since been used {{for more than a century}} in many parts of the world. Design and composition of the vacuum <b>coffee</b> <b>maker</b> varies. The chamber material is borosilicate glass, metal, or plastic, and the filter can be either a glass rod or a screen made of metal, cloth, paper, or nylon. The Napier Vacuum Machine, presented in 1840, was an early example of this technique. While vacuum coffee makers generally were excessively complex for everyday use, they were prized for producing a clear brew, and were quite popular until the middle of the twentieth century. The Bauhaus interpretation of this device can be seen in Gerhard Marcks' Sintrax <b>coffee</b> <b>maker</b> of 1925.|$|E
