40|$|SETTING: Two {{projects}} {{were introduced in}} October 2007 to improve treatment completion among rural-to-urban migrant tuberculosis (TB) patients in Shanghai. The Communicable Disease Research Consortium (<b>COMDIS)</b> project provided financial incentives to poor patients, whereas the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) project provided incentives to all patients and increased staff time. OBJECTIVE: To assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of these two projects. METHODS: Case study. Costs were assessed from a societal perspective. The primary measure of effectiveness was the treatment completion rate. The incremental cost- effectiveness ratio was calculated as the additional cost of the intervention divided by the additional percentage of patients completing treatment compared to controls. RESULTS: Post intervention, the treatment completion rates in the <b>COMDIS</b> and Global Fund {{projects were}} respectively 89 % and 88 %, 17 % and 16 % {{higher than in the}} control district (76 %). For one additional percent of patients to complete treatment, the additional cost of the <b>COMDIS</b> intervention was US$ 1891, 91 % lower than that of the Global Fund intervention (US$ 21 904). CONCLUSION: The intervention that addressed the financial barriers of poor patients was more cost-effective than the comprehensive intervention that provided assistance to both patients and providers. Further study is needed to understand the process of interventions prior to wider scale-up. © 2013 The Union...|$|E
40|$|Alzheimer&# 39;s {{disease is}} the leading cause of {{dementia}} in older adults. Although memory problems are the most characteristic symptom of this disorder, many individuals also experience progressive problems with communication. This systematic review investigates the effectiveness of methods to improve the verbal communication of individuals with Alzheimer&# 39;s disease with their caregivers. The following databases were reviewed: PsychINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, REHABDATA, and <b>COMDIS.</b> The inclusion criteria were: (i) experimentally based studies, (ii) quantitative results, (iii) intervention aimed at improving verbal communication of the affected individual with a caregiver, and (iv) at least 50 &# 37; of the sample having a confirmed diagnosis of Alzheimer&# 39;s disease. A total of 13 studies met all of the inclusion criteria. One technique emerged as potentially effective: the use of memory aids combined with specific caregiver training programs. The strength of this evidence was restricted by methodological limitations of the studies. Both adoption of and further research on these interventions are recommended...|$|E
40|$|Copyright (c) 2003 by the American Physiological Society. In literature, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the central nervous system (CNS) anticipates sponta-neous change in body position during quiet stance, and continuously modulates ankle extensor muscle activity to compensate for the change. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether velocity feedback contributes in modulating ankle extensors activities in an anticipatory fashion, facilitating effective control of quiet stance. Both theoretical analysis and experiments were carried out to investigate to what extent velocity feedback contributes to controlling quiet stance. The experiments were carried out with sixteen healthy subjects who were asked to stand quietly with their eyes open or closed. During the experiments, the center of pressure (COP) displacement (COPdis), the center of mass (COM) displacement (<b>COMdis)</b> and COM velocity (COMvel) in the anteroposterior direction were measured. Rectified electromyograms (EMGs) were used to measure muscle activity in the right soleus muscle, the medial gastrocnemius mus-cle and the lateral gastrocnemius muscle. The simulations were performed using an inverted pendulum model that described the anteroposterior kinematics and dynamics of quiet stance...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was determine the ma- ximum application uniformity of closed circuit trickle irrigation systems designs. Laboratory tests carried out for Two types of closed circuits: a) One manifold for lateral lines or Closed circuits with One Manifold of Trikle Irrigation System (COMTIS); b) Closed circuits with Two Manifolds of Trikle Irrigation System (CTMTIS), and c) Traditional Trikle Irrigation System (TTIS) as a control. Three lengths of lateral lines were used, 40, 60, and 80 meters. PE tubes lateral lines: 16 mm diameter; 30 cm emitters distance, and GR built-in emitters 4 lph when operating pressure 1 bar. Experiments were conducted at the Agric. Eng. Res. Inst., ARC, MALR, Egypt. With COMTIS the emitter flow rate was 4. 07, 3. 51, and 3. 59 lph compared to 4. 18, 3. 72, and 3. 71 lph with CTMTIS and 3. 21, 2. 6, and 2. 16 lph with TTIS (lateral lengths 40, 60, and 80 meters respectively). Uniformity varied widely within individual lateral lengths and between circuit types. Under CTMTIS uniformity values were 97. 74, 95. 14, and 92. 03 %; with COMTIS they were 95. 73, 89. 45, and 83. 25 %; and with TTIS they were 88. 27, 84. 73, and 80. 53 % (for lateral lengths 40, 60, 80 meters respectively). The greatest uniformity was observed under CTMTIS and COMTIS when using the shortest lateral length 40 meters, then lateral length 60 meters, while the lowest value was observed when using lateral length 80 meters this result depends on the physical and hydraulic characteristics of the emitter and lateral line. CTMTIS was more uniform than either COMTIS or TTIS. Friction losses were decreased with CTMTIS in the emitter laterals at lengths 40 meters compared to TTIS and COMTIS. Therefore, differences may be related to increased friction losses when using TDIS and <b>COMDIS...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND In Uganda, like in {{many other}} {{countries}} traditionally viewed as harbouring very high malaria transmission, the norm has been to recommend that febrile episodes are diagnosed as malaria. In this study, the policy implications of such recommendations are revisited. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was undertaken at outpatient departments of all health facilities in four Ugandan districts. The routine diagnostic practices were assessed for all patients during exit interviews and a research slide was obtained for later reading. Primary outcome measures were the accuracy of national recommendations and routine malaria diagnosis {{in comparison with the}} study definition of malaria (any parasitaemia on expert slide examination in patient with fever) stratified by age and intensity of malaria transmission. Secondary outcome measures were the use, interpretation and accuracy of routine malaria microscopy. RESULTS 1, 763 consultations undertaken by 233 health workers at 188 facilities were evaluated. The prevalence of malaria was 24. 2 % and ranged between 13. 9 % in patients ≥ 5 years in medium-to-high transmission areas to 50. 5 % for children < 5 years in very high transmission areas. Overall, the sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of routine malaria diagnosis were high (89. 7 % and 91. 6 % respectively) while the specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) were low (35. 6 % and 30. 8 % respectively). However, malaria was under-diagnosed in 39. 9 % of children less than five years of age in the very high transmission area. At 48 facilities with functional microscopy, the use of malaria slide examination was low (34. 5 %) without significant differences between age groups, or between patients for whom microscopy is recommended or not. 96. 2 % of patients with a routine positive slide result were treated for malaria but also 47. 6 % with a negative result. CONCLUSION Current recommendations and associated clinical practices result in massive laria over-diagnosis across all age groups and transmission areas in Uganda. Yet, under-diagnosis is also common in children < 5 years. The potential benefits of malaria microscopy are not realized. To address malaria misdiagnosis, Uganda's policy shift from presumptive to parasitological diagnosis should encompass introduction of malaria rapid diagnostic tests and substantial strengthening of malaria microscopy. <b>COMDIS</b> Research Programme Consortium; Wellcome Trust Principal Research Fellowship (# 079080...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Case-management with artemether-lumefantrine (AL) {{is one of}} the key {{strategies}} to control malaria in many African countries. Yet, the reports on translation of AL implementation activities into clinical practice are scarce. Here the quality of AL case-management is reported from Uganda; approximately one year after AL replaced combination of chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (CQ+SP) as recommended first line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. METHODS A cross-sectional survey, using a range of quality of care assessment tools, was undertaken at all government and private-not-for-profit facilities in four Ugandan districts. Main outcome measures were AL prescribing, dispensing and counseling practices in comparison with national guidelines, and factors influencing health workers decision to 1) treat for malaria, and 2) prescribe AL. RESULTS 195 facilities, 232 health workers and 1, 763 outpatient consultations were evaluated. Of 1, 200 patients who needed treatment with AL according to guidelines, AL was prescribed for 60 %, CQ+SP for 14 %, quinine for 4 %, CQ for 3 %, other antimalarials for 3 %, and 16 % of patients had no antimalarial drug prescribed. AL was prescribed in the correct dose for 95 % of patients. Only three out of seven AL counseling and dispensing tasks were performed for more than 50 % of patients. Patients were more likely to be treated for malaria if they presented with main complaint of fever (OR = 5. 22; 95 % CI: 3. 61 – 7. 54) and if they were seen by supervised health workers (OR = 1. 63; 95 % CI: 1. 06 – 2. 50); however less likely if they were treated by more qualified health workers (OR = 0. 61; 95 % CI: 0. 40 – 0. 93) and presented with skin problem (OR = 0. 29; 95 % CI: 0. 15 – 0. 55). AL was more likely prescribed if the appropriate weight-specific AL pack was in stock (OR = 6. 15; 95 % CI: 3. 43 – 11. 05) and when CQ was absent (OR = 2. 16; 95 % CI: 1. 09 – 4. 28). Routine AL implementation activities were not associated with better performance. CONCLUSION Although the use of AL was predominant over non-recommended therapies, the quality of AL case-management at the point of care is not yet optimal. There is an urgent need for innovative quality improvement interventions, which should be rigorously tested. Adequate availability of ACTs at the point of care will, however, ultimately determine the success of any performance interventions and ACT policy transitions. <b>COMDIS</b> Research Programme Consortium; Wellcome Trust Principal Research Fellowship (# 079080...|$|E
