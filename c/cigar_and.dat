5|$|According to the story, {{unaware of}} the nature of the gift, Norton saved the cigar, keeping it on display in his college's museum. Years later, when the school was {{shutting}} its doors for good, the alumni thought it would be a fitting gesture to smoke the cigar at the college's annual reunion. The honor was given to Winstead Norton, Horace's grandson. During the sober speech he was presenting, Winstead lit the <b>cigar,</b> <b>and</b> after two puffs, it exploded. A 1952 news report contradicts one detail, holding that the explosion ultimately occurred at a family reunion rather than the alumni affair noted.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary risk}} factor for COPD {{globally}} is tobacco smoking. Of those who smoke about 20% will get COPD, and {{of those who are}} lifelong smokers about half will get COPD. In the United States and United Kingdom, of those with COPD, 80–95% are either current smokers or previously smoked. The likelihood of developing COPD increases with the total smoke exposure. Additionally, women are more susceptible to the harmful effects of smoke than men. In non-smokers, secondhand smoke is the cause of about 20% of cases. Other types of smoke, such as, marijuana, <b>cigar,</b> <b>and</b> water pipe smoke, also confer a risk. Water pipe smoke appears to be as harmful as smoking cigarettes. Problems from marijuana smoke may only be with heavy use. Women who smoke during pregnancy may increase the risk of COPD in their child. For the same amount of cigarette smoking, women have a higher risk of COPD than men.|$|E

Usher is then shown with female background dancers in a white room. In the scene he dons a pair of glasses which show the dancers performing through the lens. Usher then dances outside {{in front of a}} concrete wall, with male background dancers appearing as shadows. As will.i.am. performs his verse, he and Usher are seen in their corresponding rooms with flashing lights.

5|$|Wyatt {{said in his}} {{deposition}} afterward that he {{had been}} temporarily acting as city marshal for Virgil the week before while Virgil was in Tucson for the Pete Spence and Frank Stilwell trial. Wyatt said that he still considered himself a deputy city marshal, which Virgil later confirmed. Since Wyatt was an off-duty officer, he could not legally search or arrest Tom for carrying a revolver within the city limits-—a misdemeanor offense. Only Virgil or one of his city police deputies, including Morgan Earp and possibly Warren Earp, could search him and take any required action. Wyatt, a non-drinker, testified at the Spicer hearing that he went to Haffords and bought a <b>cigar</b> <b>and</b> went outside to watch the Cowboys. At the time of the gunfight about two hours later, Wyatt could not know if Tom was still armed.|$|E

25|$|The gatherings {{followed}} a definite ritual. First {{one of the}} members would present a paper.

25|$|Second-hand {{smoke is}} a mixture of smoke from the burning end of a cigarette, pipe or <b>cigar,</b> <b>and</b> the smoke exhaled from the lungs of smokers. It is involuntarily inhaled, lingers in the air hours after {{cigarettes}} have been extinguished, and may cause a wide range of adverse health effects, including cancer, respiratory infections and asthma. Non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke at home or work are thought, due {{to a wide variety of}} statistical studies, to increase their heart disease risk by 25–30% and their lung cancer risk by 20–30%. Second-hand smoke has been estimated to cause 38,000 deaths per year, of which 3,400 are deaths from lung cancer in non-smokers.|$|E
25|$|In 1893, Ira Clinton Van Noy {{formed a}} retail <b>cigar</b> <b>and</b> news {{business}} at No. 1076 Union Avenue, in Kansas City, Missouri. Four years later, on July 26, 1897, he joined {{with two of}} his brothers, Charles S. Van Noy and J.L. Van Noy, along with G.W. Krebs of St. Louis, to incorporate the Van Noy Railroad News Company. Railroad 'news services' generally sold magazines, newspapers, books, tobacco products, fruits, nuts and novelties from newsstands located in train stations and by the use of a 'news butch', a railroad news service employee who walked through the train making sales. As the business flourished, the Van Noy brothers became prominent members of local Kansas City society. I.C. Van Noy, the eldest brother, {{served as president of the}} company, and the youngest brother, Henry Clay Van Noy, also joined the company when he came of age.|$|E
25|$|The active {{substances}} in tobacco, especially cigarettes, are administered by {{burning the leaves}} and inhaling the vaporized gas that results. This quickly and effectively delivers substances into the bloodstream by absorption through the alveoli in the lungs. The lungs contain some 300 million alveoli, which amounts to a surface area of over 70m2 (about {{the size of a}} tennis court). This method is not completely efficient as not all of the smoke will be inhaled, and some amount of the {{active substances}} will be lost in the process of combustion, pyrolysis. Pipe and Cigar smoke are not inhaled because of its high alkalinity, which are irritating to the trachea and lungs. However, because of its higher alkalinity (pH 8.5) compared to cigarette smoke (pH 5.3), non-ionized nicotine is more readily absorbed through the mucous membranes in the mouth. Nicotine absorption from <b>cigar</b> <b>and</b> pipe, however, is much less than that from cigarette smoke. Nicotine and cocaine activate similar patterns of neurons, which supports the existence of common substrates among these drugs.|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} a footage of Usher walking offstage during a show part of his OMG Tour (2010—11), held at the O2 Arena, Berlin in January 2011. Subsequently, {{announcer}} explains, [...] "He tried because he loves Berlin and {{he really wanted to}} give you guys a show, but he just couldn’t do it. Thanks for understanding." [...] Usher then speaks with a remorse, [...] "I felt like a failure, hopeless, paralyzed, numb." [...] As the song starts Usher is seen chanting the lyrics while several sequence shots of him with his son and a sick woman in hospital are shown. The scenes are intercuted by Usher performing in a room full with bright white lights. Several other short scenes of Usher taking care of the sick woman, his son having a meal and Usher throwing money at strippers are shown. Several natural environments are projected onto a wall the singer stands in front off. As the song progresses, he enters in a glass box and starts dancing during the chorus. Scenes of Usher having toast with his friends, smoking a <b>cigar</b> <b>and</b> watching strippers performing lap-dance for him are shown. The singer is shown holding man's hand while he dies in a hospital. Then, he is seen unable to perform and cries in front of the microphone. The video ends with Usher managing to break the glass box.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a {{dictionary}} definition of the word [...] "diva", before cutting to a parking lot outside of a warehouse. Beyoncé, {{wearing a pair of}} [...] "dangle shades", walks past a car full of mannequin parts into the warehouse. From here, she is accompanied by her two dancers and a variety of high fashion outfits. When she states [...] "Diva's gettin' money..." [...] she waves a fan made of $100 bills. During the bridge to the climax, Beyoncé dances on a single light and then during the climax, she is seen very glossy in another wardrobe choice dancing in robotic movements to the beat with gold punctuating the black and white scene. In one scene, Beyoncé is seen dancing robotically in front of a set of gold-tinted mannequins; while in another, she dances against a wall with two large chains hanging from the ceiling. During the last chorus, Beyoncé is in her last wardrobe change in front of window which is where the paparazzi had taken photos of her. At the end of the song, Beyoncé walks back out to the parking lot. She lights up a <b>cigar</b> <b>and</b> throws the lighter into the car, letting it explode. As she walks away, the intro to [...] "Video Phone" [...] (a track from I Am... Sasha Fierce) plays. The explosion retains its original fiery colors in contrast with the black and white.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the accusations}} of {{nepotism}} that greeted his appointment on January 3, 1903, Sifton fast became a well-respected judge. [...] He served as {{chief justice of}} the Northwest Territories until September 16, 1907, when the Supreme Court of Alberta was established, whereupon he headed this new court, sitting in Calgary as the first Chief Justice of Alberta. [...] He was notoriously difficult for barristers to read: he generally heard arguments expressionlessly smoking a <b>cigar,</b> <b>and</b> it was as a judge that he first acquired his long-time nickname of the Sphinx for his inscrutability. [...] In one trial, he sat apparently vigorously taking notes during both sides' lengthy closing arguments and, once they concluded, immediately delivered his judgment. [...] The bewildered lawyers wondered what he had been writing down, since he had obviously made up his mind before closing arguments; once Sifton had left the courtroom, they found their answer in the form of page after page covered with the judge's signature. [...] He rarely recorded his ratio decidendi but, despite this, few of his decisions were overturned on appeal. It has also been argued that his fellow judges had difficulty ruling on appeals from his decisions specifically because he rarely provided reasons. Much of his work was in criminal law, dealing especially with theft of livestock (in which cases he generally delivered a sentence of three years hard labour, severe {{by the standards of the}} day). By the end of his judicial career, he had convicted as many Americans as Canadians. His rulings were generally concerned with practicalities rather than legal theory, based more on social morality than legal precedent, and he did not establish any important precedents.|$|E
