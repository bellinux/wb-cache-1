5|$|Any {{mechanical}} component will unavoidably possess both mass and stiffness. This translates in electrical terms to an LC circuit, that is, a circuit consisting of an inductor and a capacitor, hence {{mechanical component}}s are resonators {{and are often}} used as such. It is still possible to represent inductors and <b>capacitors</b> as individual lumped elements in a mechanical implementation by minimising (but never quite eliminating) the unwanted property. <b>Capacitors</b> may be made of thin, long rods, that is, the mass is minimised and the compliance is maximised. Inductors, on the other hand, may be made of short, wide pieces which maximise the mass {{in comparison to the}} compliance of the piece.|$|E
5|$|When {{the power}} company's voltage becomes {{distorted}} due to harmonics, losses in other loads such as normal fixed-speed AC motors are increased. This condition {{may lead to}} overheating and shorter operating life. Also, substation transformers and compensation <b>capacitors</b> are affected negatively. In particular, <b>capacitors</b> can cause resonance conditions that can unacceptably magnify harmonic levels. In order to limit the voltage distortion, owners of VFD load {{may be required to}} install filtering equipment to reduce harmonic distortion below acceptable limits. Alternatively, the utility may adopt a solution by installing filtering equipment of its own at substations affected by the large amount of VFD equipment being used. In high-power installations, harmonic distortion can be reduced by supplying multi-pulse rectifier-bridge VFDs from transformers with multiple phase-shifted windings.|$|E

5|$|Campbell had {{previously}} utilised the condition {{discovered in the}} work of Oliver Heaviside for lossless transmission to improve the frequency response of transmission lines using lumped component inductors (loading coils). When Campbell started investigating electric wave filter design from 1910, this previous work naturally led him to filters using ladder network topology using <b>capacitors</b> and inductors. Low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filters were designed. Sharper cut-offs and higher stop-band rejection to any arbitrary design specification could be achieved merely by increasing the length of the ladder. The filter designs used by Campbell were described by Zobel as constant k filters although this was not a term used by Campbell himself.|$|E

The most common topology for these is shunt anti-resonators coupled by series <b>capacitors,</b> less commonly, by inductors, {{or in the}} case of a two-section filter, by mutual inductance. These are most useful where the design requirement is not too stringent, that is, moderate bandwidth, roll-off and passband ripple.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} to design linear analogue mechanical filters using mechanical components which filter mechanical vibrations or acoustic waves. While there are few applications for such devices in mechanics per se, {{they can be used}} in electronics with the addition of transducers to convert to and from the electrical domain. Indeed, some of the earliest ideas for filters were acoustic resonators because the electronics technology was poorly understood at the time. In principle, the design of such filters can be achieved entirely in terms of the electronic counterparts of mechanical quantities, with kinetic energy, potential energy and heat energy corresponding to the energy in inductors, <b>capacitors</b> and resistors respectively.|$|E
5|$|Passive linear {{electronic}} analogue {{filters are}} those filters {{which can be}} described with linear differential equations (linear); they are composed of <b>capacitors,</b> inductors and, sometimes, resistors (passive) and are designed to operate on continuously varying (analogue) signals. There are many linear filters which are not analogue in implementation (digital filter), {{and there are many}} electronic filters which may not have a passive topology both of which may have the same transfer function of the filters described in this article. Analogue filters are most often used in wave filtering applications, that is, where it is required to pass particular frequency components and to reject others from analogue (continuous-time) signals.|$|E

50|$|This example can be {{implemented}} with a capacitive or resistive-capacitive integrating circuit driven respectively by a constant current or voltage source, and a threshold device with hysteresis (neon lamp, thyratron, diac, reverse-biased bipolar transistor, or unijunction transistor) connected in parallel to the <b>capacitor.</b> The <b>capacitor</b> is charged by the input source causing the voltage across the <b>capacitor</b> to rise. The threshold device does not conduct at all until the <b>capacitor</b> voltage reaches its threshold (trigger) voltage. It then increases heavily its conductance in an avalanche-like manner because of the inherent positive feedback, which quickly discharges the <b>capacitor.</b> When the voltage across the <b>capacitor</b> drops to some lower threshold voltage, the device stops conducting and the <b>capacitor</b> begins charging again, and the cycle repeats ad infinitum.|$|R
