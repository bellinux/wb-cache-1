5000|$|A {{long string}} of [...] "faced" [...] letters (i.e. turned to allow the address to be read) is {{presented}} to a keyboard operator at a <b>coding</b> <b>desk,</b> who types the postcodes onto the envelopes in coloured phosphor dots. The associated machine uses the outward codes in these dots to direct bundles of letters into the correct bags for specific delivery offices. With a machine knowledge of the specific addresses handled by each postal walk at each office, the bundles can be further sorted using the dots of the inward sorting code so that each delivery round receives only its own letters. This feature depends upon {{whether or not it}} is cost effective to second-sort outward letters, and tends to be used only at main sorting offices where high volumes are handled. When postcodes are incomplete or missing, the operator reads the post town name and inserts a code sufficient for outward sorting to the post town where others can further direct it. The mail bags of letter bundles are sent by road, air or train, and eventually by road to the delivery office. At the delivery office the mail that is handled manually is inward sorted to the postal walk that will deliver it, and it is then [...] "set in", sorted into the walk order that allows the deliverer the most convenient progress in the round. The latter process is now being automated, as the rollout of walk sequencing machines continues.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} ufthe {{optical character}} reading (OCR) machine for high-speed code marking and sortation of letter mail {{has led to}} the need for a high-speed method of printing the phosphorescent code marks used by the mechanised letter sorting machines. This paper looks at the requirements,for the printing system, the method adopted and the results achieved. 1 HISTORY Early {{in the development of the}} automatic letter sorting system the British Post Ofice (BPO) adopted a system of code marking letter mail with phosphorescent machine readable codes. Phosphorescent encoding was chosen in preference to fluorescent, magnetic, or passive optical encoding because envelopes have no natural phosphorescence thus simplifying the detection of the coded information. Fluorescent and magnetic encoding systems are more likely to suffer from background inter-ference; background fluorescence occurs from optical brightening agents (OBAs) added to the paper in manu-facture and background magnetism from enclosures within envelopes. A passive optical system, black and white bars, places a constraint on the customer to leave a set area of the envelope blank and is unacceptable. The method of coding currently in use on coding desks is hot melt transfer which, although highly effec-tive on all envelope materials at <b>coding</b> <b>desk</b> rates, is an inherently slow process having a maximum throughput speed of two items per second. Optical character reading (OCR) machines are cost effective only at high throughput rates, of the order of ten items per second, and so a new method of printing was required to match the increased speed. Enclosures within envelopes can be irregular in shape, raising some parts of the envelope surface and leaving cavities elsewhere, thus the envelope can be ren-dered vulnerable to damage by high pressures from an impact type of printer. An ink jet printer imposes almost zero impact pressure on the printed item and also has the capability of high printing speed; it thus became the first choice solution to the printing problem even though no suitable phosphorescent ink was avail-able at the time.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{theoretical}} and practical issues of special-purpose keyboard design and operator training precedures. It is in two parts. The research discussed in Part A {{was carried out in}} support of two contracts from the Post Office and had two main objectives: first, to provide information needed for the selection of a new keyboard design for use on foreign destination <b>coding</b> <b>desks</b> and second, to evaluate one component of a computerbased training system for operators of the new keyboard. In relation to the first objective, four keyboard designs were evaluated, namely the 2 x 6, 4 x 4, 10 -key chord and 10 -key sequential. On the basis of the results of three experiments, the 10 -key chord keyboard was chosen and recommended to the Post Office as the most efficient of the four layouts. The computer-based training system for operators of foreign destination letter <b>coding</b> <b>desks</b> consists of three stages. In this thesis only the first such stage is discusssed, namely the Keyboard Familiarization, which involves developing the skill of keying chord patterns. Four different computer-based training methods are presented, discussed and evaluated in an experiment specifically designed for this purpose. The main issue of Part B is speed-accuracy tradeoff relationships in a keyboard task. Following a discussion of the limitations of typical Choice Reaction Time models and the benefits of studying speed-accuracy tradeoff relationships, another analysis of the data of Experiment 4 is presented. In this analysis, the speed and accuracy of any given response are examined in terms of those of the preceding response. These findings are discussed in the light of established theories and it is concluded that no known theory can fully account for the obtained results. A new theoretical model is presented to explain them. Finally, this new model is assessed and its implications for keyboard operation and operator training are considered...|$|R

5000|$|Technical reviews. One {{study found}} that the average defect {{detection}} rates of informal <b>code</b> reviews and <b>desk</b> checking are 25% and 40% respectively. Walkthroughs were found to have defect detection rate of 20% - 40%, but were found also to be expensive specially when project pressures increase. Code reading was found by NASA to detect 3.3 defects per hour of effort versus 1.8 defects per hour for testing. It also finds 20% - 60% more errors {{over the life of the}} project than different kinds of testing. A study of 13 reviews about review meetings, found that 90% of the defects were found in preparation for the review meeting while only around 10% were found during the meeting.|$|R
50|$|Quotron’s success {{attracted}} the attention of Robert S. Sinn, who observed its disadvantages: it could only give a last price. The opening price, high and low for the day, and share volume were not available. His system received the ticker transmissions from the various stock and commodity exchanges. These were then automatically interpreted by a hard wired digital computer updating a drum memory with the last sale prices {{and at the same time}} computing and updating highs and lows and total volume for each stock. As these items were updated a data packet would be generated for transmission by AT&T Dataphone at 1000 bits/second to identical magnetic drum storage devices in each major city in the United States. These slave drum memory units located in the metropolitan centers in the US could then be accessed by desk units in local stock brokerage offices again using Dataphone transmission. The desk units would set up the ticker symbol code for the desired stock by mechanical means actuating micro switches. The local control box would continuously interrogate each desk unit in sequence and send a request data packet by Dataphone to the local drum memory which would then send return data packets back to the local brokerage office. Each packet both for request and answer would contain the request stock alphabetic symbols plus a desk unit identifier. Because the desk units set up the requested stock <b>code</b> statically the <b>desk</b> unit would automatically update the stock price, volume, and highs and lows without any operator intervention because the control unit could complete the interrogation of all desk units in the office in about every one or two seconds, This is the first use of data packet transmission with the sender’s identification imbedded in the data packet in order to avoid switching- a forerunner of the internet? There was no switching in the entire system; all was done with data packets containing sender identifiers.|$|R
