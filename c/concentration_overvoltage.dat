40|$|Although micro-patterned {{membranes}} {{improve the}} performances of proton exchange membrane fuel cells, their intrinsic effect has not been clarified. This paper aims to clarify {{the effect of the}} patterned surfaces in terms of the overvoltage by fabricating well-defined micro-pillar structures on the cathode side of the membrane via thermal imprint lithography. Cell performance data and numerical simulation revealed that the pillar structures reduce the proton transport resistance and mass transport loss in the cathode catalyst layers. The reduced proton transport resistance expands the catalyst layers contributing the power generation toward the interface between the catalyst and gas diffusion layers. This decreases the average permeation distance of oxygen to react at the catalyst, which would explain the observed reduction of the <b>concentration</b> <b>overvoltage.</b> The pillar structures reduce the ohmic overvoltage predominantly at a relative humidity of < 25 % and a current density of < 500 mA/cm 2. The <b>concentration</b> <b>overvoltage</b> suppression becomes more significant at higher humidity and current densities where the oxygen diffusion to the catalyst is blocked by water. Our findings are useful to design optimum pillar structures that maximize the fuel cell cathode performances. Â© 2013 The Electrochemical Society. [DOI: 10. 1149 / 2. 085304 jes] All rights reserved.

40|$|Porous, {{sintered}} plate, {{nickel oxide}} electrodes containing varied amounts of active material (nickel hydroxide) were investigated {{with a single}} pulse interruption technique. Double layer capacitance measurements and long time overvoltage decay suggest that the nickel hydroxide deposited in the pores in sequential impregnations i deposited as a sponge of discrete particles. The available surface area proves, therefore, to be proportional to the Ni (OH) 2 weight. The long decay times indicate solid-state diffusion or relaxation phenomena on top of l iquid <b>concentration</b> <b>overvoltage,</b> which becomes in-creasingly important with heavi ly impregnated electrodes. Some investigations on the fi lm-type nickel oxide electrode {{seem to suggest that}} the thickness of the nickel hydroxide layer not only influences the polariza-tion behavior but also strongly influences the coefficient of util ization of the active material.

40|$|The anodic {{electrochemical}} {{behavior of}} the water vapor electrolysis cell was investigated. A theoretical review of various aspects of cell overvoltage is presented with special emphasis on <b>concentration</b> <b>overvoltage</b> and activation overvoltage. Other sources of overvoltage are described. The experimental apparatus controlled and measured anode potential and cell current. Potentials between 1. 10 and 2. 60 V (vs NHE) and currents between 0. 1 and 3000 mA were investigated. Different behavior was observed between the standard cell and the free electrolyte cell. The free electrolyte cell followed typical Tafel behavior (i. e. activation overvoltage) with Tafel slopes of about 0. 15, and the exchange current densities of 10 to the minus 9 th power A/sq cm, both in good agreement with literature values. The standard cell exhibitied this same Tafel behavior at lower current densities but deviated toward lower than expected current densities at higher potentials. This behavior and other results were examined to determine their origin...|$|E

The corroding metal surface is described as an ensemble of microcells randomly moving on the surface.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a macroscopic model of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) {{with the aim}} to perform a simulation of the whole generator. Three sub-models {{have been developed to}} take into fluidic, thermal and electrical phenomena. The fluidic sub-model is based on an equivalent circuit based on electrical analogy. Pressure drops in channels are modelled by resistances and the fluid accumulation in the volume is modelled by capacitor. Each electrode compartment (channel+electrode) is represented by two resistances and one capacitor. We have used this model to calculate the pressure at the catalytic sites and gas flows at fuel cell input and output. The electrical response is based on the classical Nernst potential equation, activation, ohmic and <b>concentration</b> <b>overvoltages.</b> The thermal modelling is based on a (2 D) nodal network. Two aspects are studied in this article (conduction and the convection heat transfer). Results have been validated on a 5 cell stack...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{macroscopic}} {{model of}} a short SOFC stack has been developed. The {{first part of this}} paper intends to describe a methodology for determining the transient thermal behaviour of the SOFC. A nodal network is used {{in order to determine the}} final internal temperatures of the structure. The stack is modelled by one average cell. The cell is divided into several isothermal volumes represented by their central node. The energy balances at each node are developed and solved by Matlab routine. The second part describes a fluidic model in order to compute the partial pressures of chemical species and the output flows. The fluidic model uses electrical/fluidic analogy. Pressure drops in channels are modelled through resistances and the fluid accumulation in the volume is modelled by a capacitor. The next part describes the electrochemical model based on the classical Nernst equation and computation of the overpotential (activation, <b>concentration</b> and ohmic <b>overvoltage).</b> The three submodels are then coupled in order to built a complete modelling of the stack. It has been validated and compared with experimental results on an SOFC stack provided by HTceramix...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{detailed}} {{model of a}} solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) tube is presented. The SOFC tube is discretized along its longitudinal axis. Detailed models of the kinetics of the shift and reforming reactions are introduced in order to evaluate their rates along the SOFC axis. Energy, moles, and mass balances are performed for each slice of the components under investigation, allowing the calculation of temperature profiles. Friction factors and heat-exchange coefficients are calculated by means of experimental correlations. As for the SOFC overvoltages, the activation overvoltage is calculated using the Butler-Volmer equation and semiempirical correlations for the exchange current density, Ohmic losses are evaluated introducing an appropriate electrical scheme and material resistivities, and <b>concentration</b> <b>overvoltage</b> is calculated by means of both binary and Knudsen diffusion coefficients. On {{the basis of this}} model, a case study is presented and discussed, in which temperatures, pressures, chemical compositions, and electrical parameters are evaluated for each slice of the SOFC tube under investigation. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed, in order to investigate the influence of the design parameters on the performance of the system...|$|E
40|$|Mathematical {{models are}} {{powerful}} tools {{for understanding the}} mechanisms of a working battery. This thesis develops continuum mechanics models for two battery systems: lithium-sulfur (Li-S) and rechargeable hybrid aqueous battery (ReHAB). In both models, continuous partial differential equations and the Butler-Volmer equation are {{used to describe the}} diffusion/transfer of species in electrolyte and the electrochemical reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface, respectively. The first part of the thesis deals with modeling of Li-S batteries. A mathematical model is presented and the kinetic parameters of the electrochemical reactions of polysulfides are found. Sensitivity analyses of the mathematical model are performed on different parameters, including the effects of discharge current, electronic conductivity of the cathode, precipitation rate constants, sulfur content, exchange current densities and cathode thickness. The sensitivity of the model to variations of these parameters over a wide range of values is investigated. In particular, we show that the discharge voltage profile of Li-S at low discharge current rates typically contains two plateaus, while at high current rates, the first voltage plateau disappears. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the performance of Li-S batteries {{is a function of the}} ability of the electrolyte to dissolve elemental sulfur; the undissolved portion of elemental sulfur cannot take part in the reduction reactions, thereby causing capacity loss. On the other hand, if the reduced polysulfides do not precipitate, the accumulation of the products in the electrolyte solutions results in high <b>concentration</b> <b>overvoltage</b> and prevents further electrochemical reduction. Moreover, the charge process is also simulated. In order to charge the battery completely, the reduced polysulfides must rapidly dissolve back to the electrolyte to take part in oxidation reactions. The second part of thesis investigates the electrochemistry of the zinc anode in a zinc/LiMn 2 O 4 aqueous battery. The possible electrochemical reactions on the anode are discussed in detail and a mathematical model is formulated accordingly, and the suitable kinetic parameters are also suggested. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the reversible electrochemistry of zinc in a charge/discharge cycle is modeled. The model is then evaluated with experimental data. The complicated deposition and dissolution of zinc, along with side reactions such as hydrogen evolution and zinc-water reactions, are modeled by considering the electrochemical and physical reactions of the adsorbed species on the surface of the electrode, including hydrogen and zinc hydroxide compounds. Both models are based on the mass transfer theory governed by continuous diffusion equations with boundary conditions given by the dynamics of chemical/electrochemical reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface. The details of the physicochemical processes in these two batteries are, however, different. For instance, in the Li-S battery, the dissolution of elemental sulfur and precipitation of lithium sulfides occur within the bulk of the electrolyte, and the electrochemical reactions of intermediate products (Li 2 Sx> 2) at the interface are critical processes. On the other hand, in the ReHAB, the dynamics of interfacially adsorbed species on the zinc determine the battery behavior during charge and discharge cycles. In spite of the similarities and differences between the two systems, the models nevertheless give much insight into the working mechanisms of the two batteries...|$|E
40|$|Conductive diamond coated {{electrodes}} {{have undergone}} intensive investigation {{over the past}} number of years. The unique electrochemical properties of diamond electrodes such as their extreme chemical resistance, even at high doping <b>concentrations,</b> and high <b>overvoltage</b> for water electrolysis {{opens the door to}} numerous applications. For the industrial use of extremely promising electrode material sufficient availability, also for large area electrodes is necessary. The development of large area DIACHEMÂ® electrodes therefore has been performed on a range of base materials of numerous material geometries. For the production of these electrodes a large area HFCVD process is used which allows for reproducible coatings of substrates up to 50 Ã 100 cm. A doping with boron allows the reproducible setting of the resistivity of the diamond coating in the range of 5 to 100 m cm. The extent to which DIACHEMÂ® electrodes have been developed by now means that they can presently be applied in various industrial applications. The most important applications include: industrial waste water treatment, in particular the mineralization of toxic organic compounds; the disinfection of water; circulation systems with water which are only possible through use of an electrochemical recycling process; electrochemical synthesis, in particular from strong oxidising solutions and galvanic processes such as the recycling of chrome baths. Previous investigations have shown that the use of DIACHEMÂ® electrodes results in either a significant improvement in the effectiveness or that the process was only possible through use of this particular electrode material. The user gains a combination of the typical advantages of the electrochemical process with the high efficiency of the DIACHEMÂ® electrode which, in turn, has generated enormous interest in this particular material. In order to satisfy this interest, CONDIAS GmbH offers the DIACHEMÂ® electrode commercially...|$|R
