50|$|The first {{retractable}} roof sports venue was the now-demolished Civic Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. Constructed in 1961 for the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera, {{the arena}} {{was home to}} minor-league and NCAA D-1 basketball and ice hockey teams before becoming {{the home of the}} NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins in 1967, as well as hosting over a dozen regular season NBA games in the 1960s and 1970s. The arena's dome-shaped roof covered 170,000 sq ft and was made up of eight equal segments constructed from close to 3,000 tons of steel, in which six segments could retract underneath the remaining two, supported by a 260 ft long exterior <b>cantilevered</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{sampling}} tool {{was required}} to evaluate residual activity ({mu}Curies per square foot) on the inner wall surfaces of underground nuclear waste storage tanks. The tool {{was required to}} collect a small sample from the 3 / 8 inch thick tank walls. This paper documents the design, testing, and deployment of the remotely operated sampling device. The sampler provides material from a known surface area to estimate the overall surface contamination in the tank prior to closure. The sampler consisted of a sampler and mast assembly mast assembly, control system, and the sampler, or end effector, which {{is defined as the}} operating component of a robotic arm. The mast assembly consisted of a vertical 30 feet long, 3 inch by 3 inch, vertical steel mast and a <b>cantilevered</b> <b>arm</b> hinged {{at the bottom of the}} mast and lowered by cable to align the attached sampler to the wall. The sampler and mast assembly were raised and lowered through an opening in the tank tops, called a riser. The sampler is constructed of a mounting plate, a drill, springs to provide a drive force to the drill, a removable sampler head to collect the sample, a vacuum pump to draw the sample from the drill to a filter, and controls to operate the system. Once the sampler was positioned near the wall, electromagnets attached it to the wall, and the control system was operated to turn on the drill and vacuum to remove and collect a sample from the wall. Samples were collected on filters in removable sampler heads, which were readily transported for further laboratory testing...|$|E
25|$|A common way to {{construct}} steel truss and prestressed concrete cantilever spans is to counterbalance each <b>cantilever</b> <b>arm</b> with another <b>cantilever</b> <b>arm</b> projecting the opposite direction, forming a balanced cantilever; when they attach to a solid foundation, the counterbalancing arms are called anchor arms. Thus, in a bridge built on two foundation piers, {{there are four}} cantilever arms: two which span the obstacle, and two anchor arms which extend away from the obstacle. Because {{of the need for}} more strength at the balanced cantilever's supports, the bridge superstructure often takes the form of towers above the foundation piers. The Commodore Barry Bridge is an example of this type of cantilever bridge.|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{response}} and structural {{safety of a}} segmental precast concrete box-girder bridge during construction are investigated. The bridge is realized {{by means of a}} balanced cantilever approach where bridge segments are sequentially erected to form deck spans counterweighted about a single support. The segments are precast at the ground level, uplifted up to the deck level, and moved to the final location {{at the end of the}} <b>cantilever</b> <b>arms.</b> The results of structural analyses carried out to investigate the dynamic response of the bridge during the construction process show that a bridge failure with overturning of the <b>cantilever</b> <b>arms</b> may occur if the dynamic effects are not properly considered...|$|R

50|$|Built in 1950, the Patton Bridge {{spans the}} Green River {{near the city}} of Auburn in King County, Washington. The bridge is a three-span {{cantilever}} with two anchor <b>arms,</b> two <b>cantilever</b> <b>arms</b> and a suspended section. It includes a combination of concrete and steel box girders. The bridge was designed by Homer M. Hadley, a consulting engineer from Washington State.The anchor <b>arms</b> and <b>cantilever</b> <b>arms</b> are multiple box, two-cell reinforced concrete box girders. The suspended section consists of two spread, welded steel box girders with reinforced concrete deck. The concrete deck is fixed to the top flange plate of the girders with steel shear developers. Utilization of this deck design allows the concrete deck and steel box girders to act in composite design; i.e., the bottom flange of the steel box resists tensile forces while the concrete deck resists compressive forces.The Patton Bridge's anchor arms are 115 ft feet long, the <b>cantilever</b> <b>arms</b> are 50 ft long, and the suspended span is 100 ft. The bridge has a total length of 430 ft. The center span of 200 ft is the longest box girder span constructed in the state during the 1940s.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bridge was}} {{constructed}} in 1984 with an overall length of 1047.65 meters, comprises 34 spans of 30 meters each. The two end spans are balanced <b>cantilever</b> <b>arms.</b> Each main span consists of five prestressed [...] "I" [...] girders placed on hammerheads.|$|R
50|$|The {{longitudinal}} expansion and lateral sway {{movement of the}} deck are {{taken care of by}} expansion and articulation joints. There are two main expansion joints, one at each interface between the suspended span and the <b>cantilever</b> <b>arms,</b> and there are others at the towers and at the interface of the steel and concrete structures at both approach. There are total 8 articulation joints, 3 at each of the <b>cantilever</b> <b>arms</b> and 1 each in the suspended portion. These joints divide the bridge into segments with vertical pin connection between them to facilitate rotational movements of the deck. The bridge deck has longitudinal ruling gradient of 1 in 40 from either end, joined by a vertical curve of radius 4,000 ft. The cross gradient of deck is 1 in 48 between kerbs.|$|R
50|$|The {{distance}} of 120 m between consecutive pier-center is spanned by two 52.5 m balanced cantilever from the Piers and a 15 m suspended span in the middle. The cantilever portion is a single-cell P.S.C, box-girder in concrete of grade M-425 using special cement, post- tensioned with 90 nos. of 24x 8 mm dia, H.T.S cables. The <b>cantilever</b> <b>arm</b> has been constructed in 11 segments of different lengths. Diaphragms {{have been provided}} at pier head and 11th segment to impart tensional rigidity to the <b>cantilever</b> <b>arm.</b> Considering the unpredictable nature {{of the river and}} short working season available, cast-in-situ method of segmental construction by Traveler from-work has been preferred to pre-cast segment launching system. The entire cantilever construction having 275 segments, has been constructed at and average rate of 7 m/day which favorably compares with internationally accepted standards.|$|R

50|$|By {{the end of}} 1940, the {{erection}} of the <b>cantilevered</b> <b>arms</b> was commenced and {{was completed}} in mid-summer of 1941. The two halves of the suspended span, each 282 feet (86 m) long and weighing 2,000 tons, were built in December 1941. The bridge was erected by commencing at the two anchor spans and advancing towards the center, {{with the use of}} creeper cranes moving along the upper chord. 16 hydraulic jacks, each of which had an 800-ton capacity, were pressed into service to join the two halves of the suspended span.|$|R
50|$|As the {{caissons}} {{were being}} {{sunk into the}} riverbed, the piers were being built on top of them, adding weight and driving the caisson deeper into the river bottom. The piers were masonry blocks of granite backed with concrete. The piers of the Harahan were located directly upstream of the piers of the Frisco Bridge to keep the navigation channels open to river traffic. Pier IV was moved 17 feet toward the river relative to the Frisco Pier IV. This enabled the engineers to design two suspended spans and three <b>cantilevered</b> <b>arms</b> identically.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Because many {{mechanical}} {{variables are}} present in the oral cavity, the proper load transfer between the prosthesis and the bone is important for treatment planning and for the longevity of the implant-supported fixed partial denture. Objectives To verify the stress generated on the peri-implant area of cantilevered implant-supported fixed partial dentures and the potential effects of such variable. Material and Methods A U-shaped polyurethane model simulating the mandibular bone containing two implants (Ø 3. 75 mm) was used. Six groups were formed according to the alloy’s framework (CoCr or PdAg) and the point of load application (5 mm, 10 mm and 15 mm of <b>cantilever</b> <b>arm).</b> A 300 N load was applied in pre-determined reference points. The tension generated on the mesial, lingual, distal and buccal sides of the peri-implant regions was assessed using strain gauges. Results Two-way ANOVA and Tukey statistical tests were applied showing significant differences (p< 0. 05) between the groups. Pearson correlation test (p< 0. 05) was applied showing positive correlations between the increase of the <b>cantilever</b> <b>arm</b> and the deformation of the peri-implant area. Conclusions This report demonstrated the CoCr alloy shows larger compression values compared to the PdAg alloy for the same distances of cantilever. The point of load application influences the deformation on the peri-implant area, increasing in accordance with the increase of the lever arm...|$|R
