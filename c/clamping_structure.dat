The {{following}} {{project has}} as aim {{to characterize the}} mechanical behavior of the active part elements and the <b>clamping</b> <b>structure</b> system through a mathematical model evaluated during the most critical condition (short-circuit). The short-circuit study in transformer {{is one of the}} most complex, additionally, it requires diferent disciplines for its analysis. The general steps for a transformer dynamic study are: 1) the calculation of the short-circuit currents, which is done by IEC- 60076 - 5; 2) the calculation of the electromagnetic forces through the image method and 3) mathematical combined model application for active part and <b>clamping</b> <b>structure</b> in a dynamic analysis. The use of a mathematical model eases and reduces time in the transformer analysis under these conditions. Besides, It allows to analyze the behavior of many critical elements of the system at once. In parallel, some manufacturing guidelines were de ned for bolted joints inside the transformer (critical part, owing to the sensibility of the oil dielectric strength), e. g. the lubrication importance and the torque variations for diferent stages up to 140 % for the same force.

40|$|Abstract — Transportation {{of large}} power {{transformers}} is typically costly and can sometimes become {{a substantial portion}} of the overall lead time of procuring a transformer. Whenever the power transformer face the internal damage due to any fault or transportation, the utilities and manufacturers bears a high impact on reliability, cost and delivery cycle. There are various diagnostics methods available to assess the mechanical integrity of the transformer. One of the key tests applied for the detection of possible core and winding movement during construction, assembly and transportation of the transformer is Sweep Frequency Response Analysis (SFRA). Sweep Frequency Response Analysis (SFRA) is one of the effective diagnostic tools for detection of winding movement and other mechanical faults which affects the transformer impedance. Key advantages of SFRA compared to other diagnostic techniques are its proven sensitivity towards variety of mechanical faults and a lesser dependency on previous reference measurements. In this regards, an attempt has been made in this paper to check the SFRA analysis sensitivity towards <b>clamping</b> <b>structure</b> and insulation related faults. Case studies are presented here with the details of SFRA and other tests performed during manufacturing and transportation stages. Detailed analysis and findings are discussed in detail...|$|E
40|$|Size {{and cost}} of a {{switched}} mode power supply can be reduced by increasing the switching frequency. The maximum switching frequency and the maximum input voltage range, respectively, {{is limited by the}} minimum propagated on-time pulse, which is mainly determined by the level shifter speed. At switching frequencies above 10 MHz, a voltage conversion with an input voltage range up to 50 V and output voltages below 5 V requires an on-time of a pulse width modulated signal of less than 5 ns. This cannot be achieved with conventional level shifters. This paper presents a level shifter circuit, which controls an NMOS power FET on a high-voltage domain up to 50 V. The level shifter was implemented as part of a DCDC converter in a 180 nm BiCMOS technology. Experimental results confirm a propagation delay of 5 ns and on-time pulses of less than 3 ns. An overlapping <b>clamping</b> <b>structure</b> with low parasitic capacitances in combination with a high-speed comparator makes the level shifter also very robust against large coupling currents during high-side transitions as fast as 20 V/ns, verified by measurements. Due to the high dv/dt, capacitive coupling currents can be two orders of magnitude larger than the actual signal current. Depending on the conversion ratio, the presented level shifter enables an increase of the switching frequency for multi-MHz converters towards 100 MHz. It supports high input voltages up to 50 V and it can be applied also to other high-speed applications...|$|E

The decoupling of molecular and continuum frameworks enables a straightforward analysis of arbitrary structures and deformation modes, e. g., buckling and plate/membrane behavior. Moreover, it enables one to simultaneously identify both chemical properties (e. g., binding energy and grafting density) and mechanical properties (e. g., modulus and film geometry) that result in chemically responsive devices. We present the governing equations for scenarios where interactions between adsorbed molecules {{can be described in}} terms of pair interactions.
