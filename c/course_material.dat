5|$|The {{detailed}} {{design for the}} project was completed during summer 2006 and construction began in January 2007. The first task was to build a stable access road, but the moor was covered in a layer of peat with a low load-bearing capacity. The whole area had also been subjected to extensive coal mining during the 19th and early 20th centuries, {{so there was a}} potential for subsidence. To address these problems, the mining voids were grouted and a floating road was constructed, using a complex system of geotextiles and geogrids to prevent the road from sinking. This was achieved by laying a crushed-gravel base, reinforced with polyester and polypropylene grids, to bridge any potential mine voids and ensure that the weak shear strength of the subsoil was exceeded by the base <b>course</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with understanding how students engage with self-instructional materials on campus and at a distance {{within the context of}} the hybrid course offered at ABC College. This study examines the interrelationship of (a) time engaged with <b>course</b> <b>materials,</b> (b) the perceived value of <b>course</b> <b>materials,</b> (c) student approaches to engagement and (d) the integration of the <b>course</b> <b>materials</b> into the student learning experience in order to construct an understanding of student engagement with <b>course</b> <b>materials.</b> This study employed multiple case studies which formed a holistic collective case study. Data on student engagement with the <b>course</b> <b>materials</b> was collected using a questionnaire instrument. The resulting data was analysed using descriptive statistics to create a picture of how students engaged with the <b>course</b> <b>materials.</b> Correlation statistics were used to identify possible relationships between the items. Emerging themes were then explored in focus groups. Subsequent analysis of the focus group data explored the causation and interrelationships between themes resulting in an understanding of student engagement with the <b>course</b> <b>materials.</b> The findings from this study suggests that student engagement with self-instructional <b>course</b> <b>materials</b> (readings, learning guide, multimedia, etc.) are the result of complex interactions between a student's preferred approach to engagement, their locus of control and the method of integration of the <b>course</b> <b>materials.</b> The majority of participants preferred to engage with the <b>course</b> <b>materials</b> using a deep approach. Participants with an external locus of control reflected the assumptions and approaches they perceived from the method of integration. Participants with an internal locus of control engaged with the <b>course</b> <b>materials</b> using their preferred approach unless they were convinced that another approach served their needs better. The majority of participants exhibited an external locus of control. When a presentation or supplemental method of integrating was used, participants were more likely to engage with the <b>course</b> <b>materials</b> using a surface approach to engagement. They were also more likely to spend less time engaging with the <b>course</b> <b>materials</b> and place a lower value on the <b>course</b> <b>materials.</b> When a discussion or springboard method of integration was used participants were more likely to engage the <b>course</b> <b>materials</b> using a deep approach to engagement. They were also more likely to spend more time engaging with the <b>course</b> <b>materials</b> and place a higher value on the <b>course</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R

500|$|Writing for GameSetWatch in 2009, {{columnist}} Daniel Johnson {{pointed out}} similarities between Portal and Erving Goffman's essay on dramaturgy, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, which equates one's persona {{to the front}} and back stage areas of a theater. The game was also made part of the required <b>course</b> <b>material</b> among other classical and contemporary works, including Goffman's work, for a freshman course [...] "devoted to engaging students with fundamental questions of humanity from multiple perspectives and fostering a sense of community" [...] for Wabash College in 2010. Portal has also been cited as a strong example of instructional scaffolding that can be adapted for more academic learning situations, as the player, through careful design of levels by Valve, is first hand-held in solving simple puzzles with many hints at the correct solution, but this support is slowly removed as the player progresses in the game, and completely removed when the player reaches {{the second half of the}} game. Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Hamish Todd considered Portal as an exemplary means of game design by demonstrating a series of chambers after the player has obtained the portal gun that gently introduce the concept of flinging without any explicit instructions. Portal was exhibited at the Smithsonian Art Exhibition in America from February 14 through September 30, 2012. Portal won the [...] "Action" [...] section for the platform [...] "Modern Windows".|$|E
500|$|A cottage {{industry}} of academic research {{has built up}} around Maus, and schools have frequently used it as <b>course</b> <b>material</b> {{in a range of}} fields: history, dysfunctional family psychology, language arts, and social studies. [...] The volume of academic work published on Maus far surpasses that of any other work of comics. [...] One of the earliest such works was Joshua Brown's 1988 [...] "Of Mice and Memory" [...] from the Oral History Review, which deals with the problems Spiegelman faced in presenting his father's story. [...] Marianne Hirsch wrote an influential essay on post-memory called [...] "Family Pictures: Maus, Mourning, and Post-Memory", later expanded into a book called Family Frames: Photography, Narrative, and Postmemory. [...] Academics far outside the field of comics such as Dominick LaCapra, Linda Hutcheon, and Terrence Des Pres took part in the discourse. [...] Few approached Maus who were familiar with comics, largely {{because of the lack of}} an academic comics tradition—Maus tended to be approached as Holocaust history or from a film or literary perspective. [...] In 2003, Deborah Geis edited a collection of essays on Maus called Considering Maus: Approaches to Art Spiegelman's [...] "Survivor's Tale" [...] of the Holocaust. [...] Maus is considered an important work of Holocaust literature, and studies of it have made significant contributions to Holocaust studies.|$|E

Though {{it should be noted}} that the arguments brought by the Institute for Monitoring Peace and Cultural Tolerance in School Education, formerly known as the Center for Monitoring Impact and Peace have been heavily disputed. In particular, according to Prof. Nathan J Brown, CMIP's [...] "method was to follow harsh criticisms with quotation after quotation purporting to prove a point...In short, the CMIP reports read as if they were written by a ruthless prosecuting attorney anxious for a conviction at any cost... Exaggerated rhetoric, charges of anti-Semitism and racism, and denial of the significance of existing changes in the curriculum will hardly convince any one further improvements are worth the effort." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the {{undergraduate}} level, Sarah Lawrence offers {{an alternative to}} traditional majors. Students pursue {{a wide variety of}} courses in four different curricular distributions: the Creative Arts (writing, music, dance, theatre, film, and the plastic arts, such as painting, printmaking, drawing and sculpture); history and the social sciences (e.g., anthropology, economics, political science, and sociology); the humanities (e.g., Asian studies, art history, film studies, languages, literature, philosophy, and religion); and natural science and mathematics (biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, and mathematics). Classes are structured around a seminar-conference system through which students learn in small, highly interactive seminars and in private tutorials with professors. Each student is assigned to a faculty advisor, known as a [...] "don," [...] to plan a course of study and provide ongoing academic guidance. [...] Most courses, apart from those in the performing arts, consist of two parts: the seminar, limited to 15 students, and the conference, a meeting with a seminar professor. [...] In these conferences, students develop individual projects that extend the <b>course</b> <b>material</b> and link it to their personal interests. [...] Sarah Lawrence has no required courses and traditional examinations have largely been replaced with research papers. [...] Additionally, grades are recorded only for transcript purposes—narrative evaluations are given in lieu of grades. The College sponsors international programs in Florence, at Wadham College, Oxford, at Reid Hall in Paris, and at the British American Drama Academy in London. [...] Sarah Lawrence is one of the only American colleges operating an international program in Cuba.|$|E
