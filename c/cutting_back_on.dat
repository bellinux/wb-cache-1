5|$|Industrial {{production}} of munitions {{was a central}} feature of the war, and with {{a third of the}} men in the labour force moved into the military, demand was very high for industrial labour. Large numbers of women were employed temporarily. Trade unions gave strong support to the war effort, <b>cutting</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> strikes and restrictive practices. Membership increased by 692% from 4.1 million in 1914, to 28.3 million by 1920. 65% of union members had been associated with the Trades Union Congress (TUC) In 1914, rising to 77% in 1920. Labour's prestige had never been higher, and it systematically placed its leaders into Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Despite strong {{warnings}} {{that it was}} a bad idea, the War Cabinet decided to impose conscription on Ireland in 1918. The main reason was that labour in Britain demanded it as the price for <b>cutting</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> exemptions for certain workers. Labour wanted the principle established that no one was exempt, but it did not demand that conscription should actually take place in Ireland. The proposal was enacted, but never enforced. The Roman Catholic bishops for the first time entered the fray, calling for open resistance to compulsory military service, while the majority of Irish nationalists moved to supporting the intransigent Sinn Féin movement (away from the constitutional Irish National Party). This proved a decisive moment, marking the end of Irish willingness to stay inside the Union.|$|E

5|$|It {{was against}} this {{backdrop}} that the Canadian Lady Corset Company had to act. In 1964, Moe Nadler died and his son, Larry Nadler inherited control of the company. Larry Nadler was a Harvard-trained MBA and brought modern marketing strategies to the industry. He commissioned market research that identified women's feelings about intimate apparel. Women did not hate their bras. Rather, they saw bras {{as a means to}} feel and look beautiful, to be fashionable and sexy, and to attract men. While women sometimes went braless, they were making a fashion choice and not a political statement. Canadian Lady's management knew that girdles were out, but bras would remain an essential part of women's wardrobes. So during the 1960s, while competitors were <b>cutting</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> their bra marketing and diversifying into other products, Canadian Lady aggressively pursued bra market share.|$|E
5|$|One of Edward's {{persistent}} challenges {{through most}} of his reign was a shortage of money; of the debts he inherited from his father, around £60,000 was still owing in the 1320s. The King {{worked his way through}} many treasurers and other financial officials, few of whom stayed long, raising revenues through often unpopular taxes, and requisitioning goods using his right of prise. He also took out many loans, first through the Frescobaldi family, and then through his banker Antonio Pessagno. Edward took a strong interest in financial matters towards the end of his reign, distrusting his own officials and attempting to increase revenues directly by <b>cutting</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the expenses of his own household.|$|E
5|$|Pressured by the United Nations, {{which had}} looked at the {{situation}} in the former East Indies with disdain, on 29August 1947 the Dutch established the Van Mook Line, which divided Dutch and Indonesian-controlled areas. Along this line a ceasefire was called. Sudirman recalled the Indonesian guerrillas hiding in Dutch-held lands, ordering them to return to Indonesian-held areas. To keep their spirits up, he referred to the withdrawal as a hijrah, reminiscent of Muhammad's migration to Medina in 622AD, implying that they would return. Over 35,000troops left western Java at this order, travelling to Yogyakarta by train and ship. This boundary was formalised by the Renville Agreement on 17January 1948; among the signatories was Amir Sjarifuddin, by then also serving as prime minister.

That year, the station completely eliminated movies as well as cutting hours on the air, signing on at 3 p.m. and off the air by Midnight. In the fall of 1974 it expanded the broadcast day slightly and added a run of the ninety-minute edition of The 700 Club in 1975 and two runs of the two-hour version of the PTL Club.

They finally decide to search in Bob's trailer at the dam construction site, and discover a briefcase full of cash. On being interrupted by Bob, the children run and hide inside the dam's turbine room, but are cornered. When confronted with the money, Bob denies knowing anything about it, stating that he's putting up his finances to build the dam walls out of concrete, but is distraught to see the walls empty and poorly constructed. The kids then believe that Bob is <b>cutting</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> construction materials by embezzling the money for himself, but Cecil shows up {{with a gun and}} reveals that {{he is the one who}} embezzled the money; now he plans on framing Bob and using him as a scapegoat when the poorly constructed dam collapses. He officially declares his greed of the money motivated him to enact his plan, though he privately admits to Bob that his true motivation was because of Bob being chosen as Krusty's sidekick instead of Cecil. Without hesitation, Cecil locks Bob, Bart and Lisa in the dam and prepares to blow it up, taking the money with him.|$|E

50|$|As Secretary of State, Blunkett pursued {{conservative}} reforms, {{ready to}} take on the teaching unions and determined to ensure basic standards of literacy and numeracy. He was rewarded with extra funding to cut class sizes, and subsequently there has since 1997 been a massive increase in literacy and numeracy, and there are 42,000 more teachers than in 1997, with doubled spending per pupil in frontline schools (and over 100,000 teaching assistants) through to 2010. A key pillar of Blunkett's work as Education Secretary was the introduction of Sure Start, a government programme which provides services for pre-school children and their families. It works to bring together early education, childcare, health and family support.

40|$|Considering {{the debates}} {{regarding}} lower {{increase in the}} economic growth after Brexit, the main objective {{of this paper is}} to measure the positive impact of economic integration of Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries on the UK economy and the effect of Brexit on the immigration from these countries to the UK. The European Union membership of some CEE countries increased, in average, the number of the UK immigrants by 12 times in the period 2004 - 2014 compared to the group of countries formed by Russia and Ukraine. The empirical fi ndings show positive economic effects of immigration on the UK’s economy, even if the pro Brexit group claimed that a control of immigration is necessary. CEE countries emigrants stimulated the UK economic growth, price stability and reduced the homicide rate. The effects of immigration on the unemployment rate, health and education spending were positive, but very low. According to mixed-effects Poisson models estimations, after Brexit the number of the UK immigrants from the CEE countries that are member of the EU might decrease by 2 times. This signifi cant decline in immigration might impose austerity measures, because of the fall in the economic growth trend with negative impact on the UK economy. Therefore, we recommend policies that focus more on high-skilled labour force than on the reduction of the number of immigrants. The UK should propose measures to slow the expected immigration decline in order to alleviate economic issues like decline in economic growth, decrease in labour productivity, <b>cutting</b> <b>backs</b> <b>on</b> public services...|$|R
