Patients were serologically confirmed by microscopic agglutination test. Twelve cases (80 %) presented with the severe form of leptospirosis. Co-morbidity (hypertonic diseases, chronic pulmonary diseases, chronic alcohol abuse, and diabetes) was registered in 13 cases. All cases had fever, oliguria, <b>conjunctival</b> <b>suffusions,</b> hepatosplenomegaly. Jaundice (14 / 93 %), hemorrhagic diathesis (13 / 87 %), vomiting (11 / 73 %), abdominal pain (10 / 67 %), myalgia (7 / 47 %) and hypotension (7 / 47 %) also were observed. Renal dysfunction was expressed by increased blood urea nitrogen (mean 38. 1 ± 24. 1 mmol/L) and serum creatinine (mean 347. 6 ± 179. 8 µmol/L). Hepatic dysfunction was expressed by increased total serum bilirubin level (mean 274. 6 ± 210. 7 µmol/L) and slightly elevated aminotransferases (ASAT mean 125. 8 ± 61. 6 IU/L; ALAT mean 131. 3 ± 126. 5 IU/L).

Aims: To investigate {{the possibility of an}} outbreak of leptospirosis and describe the clinical illness. Methods: From 24 July to 14 September 2000, children with a history of abrupt onset of high fever (. 39 C̊), who presented to our hospital, were admitted and tested serologically for anti-Leptospira antibodies by a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. An IgM titre of more than 20 U/ml confirmed the diagnosis of leptospirosis. Clinical features in the confirmed leptospirosis and leptospirosis negative groups were analysed. Results: Of 53 children screened, 18 (34 %) had leptospirosis. In all 18, the disease was anicteric and responded well to intravenous penicillin. Four clinical features present at the time of admission were significantly associated with leptospirosis: a history of contact with flood water (18 / 18 v 16 / 35), <b>conjunctival</b> <b>suffusion</b> (5 / 18 v 1 / 35), abdominal pain (9 / 18 v 5 / 35), and skin rash (5 / 18 v 1 / 35).

40|$|Summary This {{prospective}} study was undertaken {{to investigate the}} possibility of a concurrent outbreak of leptospirosis and dengue and to describe the clinical illnesses. From 20 June to 14 November 2002, children who presented to our hospital with a suspected diagnosis of leptospirosis or dengue were admitted. In every child with suspected leptospirosis, a screening latex agglutination test was carried out to detect anti-Leptospira antibodies. The diagnosis of leptospirosis was confirmed by a positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test or microagglutination test. The diagnosis of dengue was confirmed by a positive IgM antibody capture ELISA test. Clinical features in the leptospirosis and leptospirosis-negative groups, and dengue and dengue-negative groups were analysed. Of 90 children screened, 15 (16. 7 per cent) had leptospirosis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a {{bacterial}} disease affecting {{humans and animals}} alike. It is caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospira. In humans, {{it can lead to}} a wide range of presentations, some of which may be mistaken for other diseases commonly occurring in the community. Some infe cted persons, however, may be entirely asymptomatic. Without treatment, Leptospirosis can be fatal leading to kidney damage, meningitis, liver failure, respiratory distress, and even death.

Our data showed that factors favoring these disease entities included animal contact, an aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio> 2 (for leptospirosis); outdoor exposure, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, eschar, and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels (for scrub typhus and coinfection); calf tenderness, <b>conjunctival</b> <b>suffusion,</b> jaundice, oliguria, elevated total bilirubin levels and serum creatinine levels (for leptospirosis and coinfection); and maculopapular rash (for scrub typhus).

Leptospirosis is a disease with a large geographical spreading. The clinical picture varies from undiagnosed, flu-like syndrome to multiorgan involvement forms. Involvement of pericardium during leptospirosis is a rare event but not unknown. Objective: Our aim is to describe a severe case of leptospirosis (Weil's diseases) with prominent liver involvement, complicated with exudative pericarditis. Materials and Methods: A male patient, working as a mechanic, presents with fever, <b>conjunctival</b> <b>suffusion,</b> jaundice, pronounced myalgia and anuria for more than two days. Based on the clinical evidence, laboratory results showing multiorgan involvement and the epidemiological data, the patient was suspected for leptospirosis.

40|$|Context: Leptospirosis is a {{zoonotic}} disease with worldwide distribution caused by pathogenic leptospira. Leptospirosis is {{more prevalent in}} South Gujarat due to heavy rain fall and clay soil structure.

Methods and Material: This prospective study, involves patients visiting SMIMER hospital during the time period of 1 st August to 31 st October 2011 who were suspected for Leptospirosis. Their presenting complaints, examination findings, lab findings, treatment and outcome were recorded and analyzed based on the modified Faine’s criteria. Results: Among the 24 suspected cases of Leptospirosis, 14 (59 %) were males and age of patients ranged from 10 to 65 years with mean age of 34 years. Fever, myalgia, and headache were predominant complaints and all had history of contact with animals or contaminated environment. Liver functions and renal functions were deranged in 96 % and 63 % cases respectively. Fifteen patients were found positive for Leptospirosis. Fifteen (63 %) pa-tients had Weil’s syndrome and 8 had ARDS. There were 4 deaths, all were males, had ARF and presented with systolic hy-potension. Conclusions: The disease prevalence usually increases during rainy season. Most cases were from rural origin and all had history of contact with animals.

This study was aimed at determining the clinical and laboratory predictors of myocarditis or acute renal failure. Methods This was a prospective descriptive study {{carried out in the}} Teaching Hospital, Kandy, from 1 st July 2007 to 31 st July 2008. Patients with clinical features compatible with leptospirosis case definition were confirmed using the Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT). Clinical features and laboratory measures done on admission were recorded. Patients were observed for the development of acute renal failure or myocarditis. Chi-square statistics, Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare patients with and without complications. A logistic regression model was used to select final predictor variables. Results Sixty two confirmed leptospirosis patients were included in the study. Seven patients (11. 3 %) developed acute renal failure and five (8. 1 %) developed myocarditis while three (4. 8 %) had both acute renal failure and myocarditis. <b>Conjunctival</b> <b>suffusion</b> - 40 (64. 5 %), muscle tenderness - 28 (45. 1 %), oliguria - 20 (32. 2 %), jaundice - 12 (19. 3 %), hepatomegaly - 10 (16. 1 %), arrhythmias (irregular radial pulse) - 8 (12. 9 %), chest pain - 6 (9. 7 %), bleeding - 5 (8. 1 %), and shortness of breath (SOB) 4 (6. 4 %) were the common clinical features present among the patients. Out of these, only oliguria {odds ratio (OR) = 4. 14 and 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 003 - 17. 261 }, jaundice (OR = 5. 13 and 95 % CI 1. 149 - 28. 003), and arrhythmias (OR = 5. 774 and 95 % CI 1. 001 - 34. 692), were predictors of myocarditis or acute renal failure and none of the laboratory measures could predict the two complications. Conclusions This study shows that out of clinical and laboratory variables, only oliguria, jaundice and arrhythmia are strong predictors of development of acute renal failure or myocarditis in patients with leptospirosis presented to Teaching Hospital of Kandy, Sri Lanka. </p...|$|E
