5|$|Dromaeosaurid fossils {{have been}} found across the globe in North America, Europe, Africa, Japan, China, Mongolia, Manchuria, Madagascar, Argentina, and Antarctica, with fossilized teeth giving <b>credence</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{possibility}} that they inhabited Australia as well. They {{first appeared in the}} mid-Jurassic Period (late Bathonian stage, about 167 million years ago) and survived {{until the end of the}} Cretaceous (Maastrichtian stage, 66 ma), existing until the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The presence of dromaeosaurids as early as the Middle Jurassic has been suggested by the discovery of isolated fossil teeth, though no dromaeosaurid body fossils {{have been found}} from this period.|$|E
5|$|Montagu {{continued}} the deception {{to reinforce the}} existence of Major Martin, and included his details in the published list of British casualties which appeared in The Times on 4 June. By coincidence, also published that day were the names of two other officers who had died when their plane was lost at sea, and opposite the casualty listings was a report that the film star Leslie Howard had been shot down by the Luftwaffe and died in the Bay of Biscay; both stories gave <b>credence</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Major Martin story.|$|E
5|$|After four largely injury-free seasons, {{the muscular}} {{injuries}} {{that had previously}} plagued Messi reoccurred. After he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain, his appearances became sporadic. In the second leg against PSG, with an underperforming Barcelona down a goal, Messi came off the bench {{in the second half}} and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich and was unable to play at all during the second, as Barcelona were defeated 7–0 on aggregate by the eventual champions. These matches gave <b>credence</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.|$|E

2500|$|Belief in creationism is {{inversely}} {{correlated to}} education; {{of those with}} postgraduate degrees, 74% accept evolution. In 1987, Newsweek reported: [...] "By one count there are some 700 scientists with respectable academic credentials (out {{of a total of}} 480,000 U.S. earth and life scientists) who give <b>credence</b> <b>to</b> creation-science, <b>the</b> general theory that complex life forms did not evolve but appeared 'abruptly.'" ...|$|R
50|$|Newt finds Credence {{hiding in}} a subway tunnel near the City Hall station and tries to talk to him, but he is {{attacked}} by Graves. Tina, who knows Credence, arrives and attempts to calm him, while Graves tries <b>to</b> convince <b>Credence</b> <b>to</b> listen <b>to</b> him. As <b>Credence</b> begins <b>to</b> settle into human form, Aurors arrive. They seemingly disintegrate <b>Credence</b> <b>to</b> protect <b>the</b> magical society, but a tiny Obscurus fragment escapes. Graves admits <b>to</b> unleashing <b>the</b> Obscurus <b>to</b> expose <b>the</b> magical community <b>to</b> <b>the</b> No-Majs and frame Newt for it, and angrily claims that MACUSA protects the No-Majs more than themselves. After being subdued by one of Newt's beasts, he is revealed as Grindelwald in disguise and is taken into custody by MACUSA.|$|R
5|$|The American group wrote {{a scathing}} {{response}} {{to the findings of}} the TWG, stating that they had given too much emphasis on the results from the Dubna group. In particular they pointed out that the Russian group had altered the details of their claims several times over a period of 20 years, a fact that the Russian team does not deny. They also stressed that the TWG had given too much <b>credence</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chemistry experiments performed by the Russians and accused the TWG of not having appropriately qualified personnel on the committee. The TWG responded by saying that {{this was not the case}} and having assessed each point raised by the American group said that they found no reason to alter their conclusion regarding priority of discovery. The IUPAC finally used the name suggested by the American team (rutherfordium) which may in some way reflect a change of opinion.|$|E
5|$|The Davenports {{held the}} manor for around 500 years, {{and it is}} likely that they built the current house after their accession. The first William Davenport was lord of the manor from 1478 to 1528, {{and one of the first}} {{recorded}} trustees of Macclesfield Grammar School. It is possible that he was heavily involved in the final battle of the Wars of the Roses at Bosworth and thereby instrumental in gaining the crown for Henry VII, who rewarded him with a pension of 20 marks per year payable for his lifetime. According to Dean, it was during this first William's tenure that Bramall may have been vandalised by a man named Randle Hassall, who destroyed all or part of nine houses and stole the timber. This gives <b>credence</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> theory that Bramall was rebuilt, replacing or partially replacing an older building.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} attempt {{proved to be}} a further blow to relations between the Parchamites and Khalqists. The Parchamites deny that they ever planned to assassinate the Khalqist leadership, but historian Beverley Male argues that Karmal's subsequent activities give <b>credence</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Khalqist view of events. Because of the Parchamite {{assassination attempt}}, Amin pressed the Khalqist PDPA to seize power in 1976 by ousting Daoud. The majority of the PDPA leadership voted against such a move. The following year, in 1977, the Parchamites and Khalqists officially reconciled, and the PDPA was unified. The Parchamite and Khalqist PDPAs, which had separate general secretaries, politburos, central committees and other organisational structures, were officially unified in the summer of 1977. One reason for unification was that the international communist movement, represented by the Communist Party of India, Iraqi Communist Party and the Communist Party of Australia, called for party unification.|$|E
40|$|Given a prior {{distribution}} over {{a finite}} outcome space, {{how is the}} distribution updated when one outcome is excluded (i. e., assigned probability 0) ? We describe two experiments in which estimated probabilities seem to “stick ” <b>to</b> salient events. <b>The</b> probabilities of such events remain relatively invariant through updating. Our results suggest that <b>the</b> <b>credence</b> assigned <b>to</b> a salient category is sometimes more basic than <b>the</b> <b>credence</b> assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> constituents that comprise the category...|$|R
50|$|Perspectives on the {{abduction}} phenomenon are explanations that {{are intended to}} explain claims of abduction and examination by apparently otherworldly beings. The main differences between these perspectives lie in <b>the</b> <b>credence</b> ascribed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> claims. Perspectives range from the assertion that all abductions are hoaxes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> belief that the claims are of objective happenings and separate from {{the consciousness of the}} claimants.|$|R
2500|$|The Republicans' Whig-style personality-driven [...] "hurrah" [...] {{campaign}} helped stir hysteria in {{the slave}} states upon {{the emergence of}} Lincoln and intensify divisive tendencies, while Southern [...] "fire eaters" [...] gave <b>credence</b> <b>to</b> notions of <b>the</b> slave power conspiracy among Republican constituencies in the North and West. New Southern demands <b>to</b> re-open <b>the</b> African slave trade further fueled sectional tensions.|$|R
5|$|The attacks {{followed}} {{an increase in}} tension after the Hall sisters were released at Fort Blue Mounds on June 1. The sisters had been kidnapped during the Indian Creek massacre in May and were brought to Blue Mounds by a party of Ho-Chunk. Militia leader Henry Dodge became suspicious of the Ho-Chunk and took them prisoner, though they were later released as tension between the Ho-Chunk and white settlers increased. The attacks also lent <b>credence</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> belief that more Ho-Chunk were set to join Black Hawk's war against white settlers in Illinois and Michigan Territory. Though other attacks on the fort were expected they never happened and Fort Blue Mounds served as a supply center for the remaining days of the war.|$|E
5|$|Debate {{has been}} going on about whether the tail spikes were used for display only, as posited by Gilmore in 1914 or used as a weapon. Robert Bakker noted the tail was likely to have been much more {{flexible}} than that of other dinosaurs, as it lacked ossified tendons, thus lending <b>credence</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> idea of the tail as a weapon. However, as Carpenter has noted, the plates overlap so many tail vertebrae, movement would be limited. Bakker also observed that Stegosaurus could have maneuvered its rear easily, by keeping its large hind limbs stationary and pushing off with its very powerfully muscled but short fore limbs, allowing it to swivel deftly to deal with attack. More recently, a study of tail spikes by McWhinney et al., which showed a high incidence of trauma-related damage, lends more weight to the position that the spikes were indeed used in combat. This study showed that 9.8% of Stegosaurus specimens examined had injuries to their tail spikes. Additional support for this idea was a punctured tail vertebra of an Allosaurus into which a tail spike fits perfectly.|$|E
5|$|The {{arboreal}} {{hypothesis was}} popular in Heilmann's day, even {{prior to his}} research, {{as it had been}} advanced by Marsh. It fell out of favor following Ostrom's research in the 1960s and 1970s, which suggested that the ancestors of birds were fast–running bipedal animals, lending <b>credence</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cursorial model. The focus shifted back to the arboreal model when several Chinese non–avian theropods from the Early Cretaceous were found in the early 2000s. These new finds, represented chiefly by Epidendrosaurus and Microraptor, have been described as possessing features that indicate an arboreal lifestyle; Microraptor even has flight feathers on its legs, which suggest it was a glider. While the arboreal hypothesis is still popular in modern times, there are several proponents of the cursorial model and no consensus has been established. Adherence to the arboreal model is shared both by paleontologists who accept the dinosaurian ancestry of birds, and by the minority who still believe birds to have evolved from a non-dinosaurian group of reptiles. Although the arboreal model was somewhat popular before Heilmann's research, his writings helped to advance and popularize it and the idea continues to have a hold.|$|E
50|$|According {{to several}} ancient sources, {{including}} occasions by the Dictionnaire de pédagogie et d'instruction primaire by Ferdinand Buisson in 1887, the first French settlement in Senegal dates back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Dieppe Mariners in the 14th century. Flattering for Norman sailors, this argument gives <b>credence</b> also <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{idea of a}} precedence of the French presence in the region, {{but it is not}} confirmed by subsequent work.|$|R
5|$|Despite his {{popularity}} {{with the people}} of the Arab world, by mid-1957 his only regional ally was Syria. In September, Turkish troops massed along the Syrian border, giving <b>credence</b> <b>to</b> rumors that <b>the</b> Baghdad Pact countries were attempting to topple Syria's leftist government. Nasser sent a contingent force to Syria as a symbolic display of solidarity, further elevating his prestige in the Arab world, and particularly among Syrians.|$|R
50|$|The Sibley-Ahlquist {{arrangement}} differs {{greatly from}} the more traditional approach used in the Clements taxonomy. More recently published phylogenetic reconstructions based on cladistic and maximum likelihood analyses of DNA sequences lend <b>credence</b> <b>to</b> some of <b>the</b> DNA-DNA hybridization-based taxonomy, e.g. the recognition of palaeognathous birds as monophyletic and sister to all others. However, later studies failed to support many of the rearrangements in the Sibley-Ahlquist classification, such as the monophyly of the Corvida.|$|R
5|$|This {{particular}} disclosure {{has given}} rise to speculation as to whether, in addition to his efforts to rescue the Hungarian Jews, Wallenberg may have also been pursuing a parallel clandestine mission aimed at politically destabilizing Hungary’s pro-Nazi government on behalf of the OSS. This would also seem to add some <b>credence</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> potential explanation that it was his association with US intelligence that led to Wallenberg being targeted by Soviet authorities in January 1945. Several other humanitarians who had helped refugees during World War II disappeared behind the Iron Curtain in the period 1949/50, several years after Wallenberg’s disappearance. OSS ties may have been of interest to the Soviets, but are not a complete explanation because some of those detained, i.e. Hermann Field and Herta Field, had not worked for the OSS. All of these humanitarians, however, like Wallenberg, had interacted with a large number of anti-fascist and socialist refugees during the War, and this experience was used in the Stalin regime’s factional politics and show trials.|$|E
5|$|Southern Africa has no native horse populations, so {{the origins}} of the Namib Desert Horse trace to {{imported}} herds of horses. There are several theories on the ancestors of the Namib Desert Horse, and the true story may never be known. One theory says that a cargo ship carrying Thoroughbreds to Australia wrecked near the Orange River, and the strongest horses swam ashore and traveled to the Garub Plains, the home of the Namib Desert Horse, near Aus, Namibia. Another theory states that they descend from Cape horse/Basuto pony crosses ridden by Khoikhoi raiders traveling from southern Africa to north of the Orange River. The most likely theory has the Namib Desert Horse descending from a combination of escaped South African military horses and Namibian-bred German horses. During World War I, horses were used in campaigns in Namibia between the German Schutztruppe and South African troops, and some escaped or were released into the desert. Prior to this time, a German Baron von Wolf built Dunwisib Castle {{on the edge of the}} Namib Desert, where he held a herd of approximately 300 horses. Von Wolf was killed in action in Europe during World War I, and his farm was abandoned, leaving his horses on unfenced land relatively close to the area where the Namib Desert Horses now roam. The Namib Desert Horse phenotypically more closely resembles the horses bred by von Wolf and ridden by the World War I-era troops than the horses ridden by Khoikhoi tribesmen, making the former story the more likely. The genetic evidence of the 2001 study gave less <b>credence</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> descent from von Wolf's horses. He used Thoroughbreds, Hackneys and Trakehners in his breeding program, rather than the Arabian horse to which the Namib Desert Horses are the most genetically similar.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, when Bigfoot {{experts were}} {{frequently}} given high-profile media coverage, Mcleod {{writes that the}} scientific community generally avoided lending <b>credence</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> theories by debating them.|$|E
50|$|However, the {{political}} bureau {{was seen by}} some critics as an endeavor <b>to</b> legitimize <b>the</b> military's incursion <b>to</b> power by basing some of its existence to a return to democratic rule such as open debates and finalizing a return to democracy. In 1987, Newswatch magazine released an unofficial report of the bureau, for its reward, it was proscribed {{for a few months}} lending <b>credence</b> <b>to</b> some of <b>the</b> criticisms of the regime, as taking Nigerian on a farcical democratic experiment.|$|R
50|$|By mid-December, wild rumors {{started to}} fly about an {{upcoming}} communist insurrection {{that was to}} take place in the extreme north provinces against the government of President Juan Esteban Montero. In the cities of Vallenar and Copiapó the rumours were that the insurrectionists were going <b>to</b> take over <b>the</b> Esmeralda regiment barracks and the police headquarters on Christmas night, as <b>the</b> first step <b>to</b> a full-fledged revolution.

50|$|According to Alcaya's account, Guacane and Grigota {{were killed}} in an attack by the Guarani people called Chiriguanos by the Spanish.

50|$|Historian Helen Crovetto further {{develops}} {{this line}} of thought, noting that the social services provided by the Ananda Marga may have made them more vulnerable to such an accusation.

30|$|Aid in Danger {{features}} an introduction, six chapters, and a conclusion. In the introduction, Fast {{provides an overview}} of the current literature of violence against humanitarian workers and agencies and illustrates the outline of the chapters. The core assumption of this book turns to internal vulnerabilities in that the violence against humanitarian workers is to some extent “self-generated” and a result of their own actions and decisions (Fast 2014, p. 145). Feeding this narrative, she provides accounts of “questionable and sometimes unethical behavior of aid workers [..] lending <b>credence</b> <b>to</b> critiques of <b>the</b> aid system as exploitative and predatory” (Fast 2014, p. 135).|$|R

50|$|The ancestry of John Carver {{is unclear}} and makes {{research}} difficult as “John Carver” {{is a common}} enough name to have and many persons of the late-16th and early 17th centuries in England are associated with that name. A good candidate location for his ancestry may be the parish of Doncaster in Yorkshire, northern England. The author Charles Edward Banks thought so in 1929 but may have chosen the wrong Carver family <b>to</b> give <b>credence</b> <b>to</b> his research. <b>The</b> area did {{have a number of}} parishes that would eventually comprise the Separatist church whose members escaped to Holland and later to America.|$|R
25|$|Subjectivists, {{also known}} as Bayesians or {{followers}} of epistemic probability, give the notion of probability a subjective status by regarding it {{as a measure of}} the 'degree of belief' of the individual assessing the uncertainty of a particular situation.
