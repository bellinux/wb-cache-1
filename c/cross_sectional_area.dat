25|$|While {{inert gas}} reduces {{filament}} evaporation, it also conducts {{heat from the}} filament, thereby cooling the filament and reducing efficiency. At constant pressure and temperature, the thermal conductivity of a gas depends upon the molecular weight of the gas and the <b>cross</b> <b>sectional</b> <b>area</b> of the gas molecules. Higher molecular weight gasses have lower thermal conductivity, because both the molecular weight is higher and also the <b>cross</b> <b>sectional</b> <b>area</b> is higher. Xenon gas improves efficiency because of its high molecular weight, but is also more expensive, so its use is limited to smaller lamps.|$|E

25|$|An {{essential}} {{problem when}} considering LEED patterns is {{the existence of}} symmetrically equivalent domains. Domains may lead to diffraction patterns which have higher symmetry than the actual surface at hand. The reason is that usually the <b>cross</b> <b>sectional</b> <b>area</b> of the primary electron beam (~1mm²) is large compared to the average domain size {{on the surface and}} hence the LEED pattern might be a superposition of diffraction beams from domains oriented along different axes of the substrate lattice.|$|E

The velocity of the mixture discharging into the tank, and the large density differential {{between it and the}} remainder of the pulp in the tank, results in recirculating fluid patterns that keep the particles in the tank in suspension without requiring mechanical agitation.|$|E

The cold draw MFT 8 steels with {{different}} reduction in <b>cross</b> <b>sectional</b> <b>areas</b> were investigated {{to understand the}} effect of aging time on the anti-stress relaxation ability of non-quenched and tempered steel. The hardness and the anti-stress relaxation ability of cold draw NQT MFT 8 steel was improved after aging at 300 ℃since the precipitation of submicron particles within deformed ferrite. The cold draw NQT MFT 8 becomes harder and more resistant to stress relaxation with increasing aging time.

A cylindrical cavity nine inches deep and 4.25 inches in diameter was connected to a circular orifice 1.375 inches in diameter and 1.375 inches deep. The measured frequency was close to 140Hz. If the cavity acted as a one-quarter wavelength resonator, the frequency would have been 377Hz; clearly not a longitudinal resonance.|$|E
25|$|Timber columns may be {{classified}} as short columns if {{the ratio of the}} length to least dimension of the cross section is equal to or less than 10. The dividing line between intermediate and long timber columns cannot be readily evaluated. One way of defining the lower limit of long timber columns would be to set it as the smallest value of the ratio of length to least <b>cross</b> <b>sectional</b> <b>area</b> that would just exceed a certain constant K of the material. Since K depends on the modulus of elasticity and the allowable compressive stress parallel to the grain, {{it can be seen that}} this arbitrary limit would vary with the species of the timber. The value of K is given in most structural handbooks.|$|E
25|$|An {{acoustic}} horn converts large pressure variations {{with a small}} displacement area into a low pressure variation with a large displacement area and vice versa. It does this through the gradual, often exponential increase of the <b>cross</b> <b>sectional</b> <b>area</b> of the horn. The small cross-sectional area of the throat restricts the passage of air thus presenting a high acoustic impedance to the driver. This allows the driver to develop a high pressure for a given displacement. Therefore the sound waves at the throat are of high pressure and low displacement. The tapered shape of the horn allows the sound waves to gradually decompress and increase in displacement until they reach the mouth where they are of a low pressure but large displacement.|$|E

25|$|By 1985, Brabham {{had reached}} the limit of {{aerodynamic}} development of their BT52-BT53-BT54 series of cars. The 1985 car won only one race when Piquet won in France, and Murray decided that a radical approach was needed. With ground effect having been banned a few years earlier, the rear wing of a Formula One car once again created much of its downforce, but its effectiveness is reduced by the bodywork {{in front of it}} disturbing the flow of air. Brabham's tall, relatively heavy straight-four BMW M12 engine was particularly difficult to package to allow a good flow of air to the rear wing. Designers in the 1950s had addressed the same problem of reducing the cars <b>cross</b> <b>sectional</b> <b>area</b> by tilting the engines around a vertical or longitudinal axis by a small amount. Examples include the 1950s Kurtis-Kraft and Epperly Championship Cars and Colin Chapman's Formula One Lotus 16.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} Tube design, trains passing through close fitting tunnels act as pistons to create air pressure gradients between stations. This pressure difference drives ventilation between platforms {{and the surface}} exits through the passenger foot network. This system depends on adequate <b>cross</b> <b>sectional</b> <b>area</b> of the airspace above the passengers’ heads in the foot tunnels and escalators, where laminar airflow {{is proportional to the}} fourth power of the radius, the Hagen–Poiseuille equation. It also depends on an absence of turbulence in the tunnel headspace. In many stations the ventilation system is now ineffective because of alterations that reduce tunnel diameters and increase turbulence. An example is Green Park tube station, where false ceiling panels attached to metal frames have been installed that reduce the above-head airspace diameter by more than half in many parts. This has the effect of reducing laminar airflow by some 94%.|$|E
25|$|C fiber axons {{are grouped}} {{together}} {{into what is}} known as Remak bundles. These occur when an unmyelinated Schwann cell bundles the axons close together by surrounding them. The Schwann cell keeps them from touching each other by squeezing its cytoplasm between the axons. The condition of Remak bundles varies with age. The number of C fiber axons in each Remak bundle varies with location. For example, in a rat model, large bundles of greater than 20 axons are found exiting the L5 dorsal root ganglion, while smaller bundles of average 3 axons are found in distal nerve segments. Multiple neurons contribute axons to the Remak bundle with an average ratio of about 2 axons contributed per bundle. The <b>cross</b> <b>sectional</b> <b>area</b> of a Remak bundle is proportional to the number of axons found inside it. Remak bundles in the distal peripheral nerve are clustered with other Remak bundles. The Remak Schwann cells {{have been shown to be}} electrochemically responsive to action potentials of the axons contained within them.|$|E

40|$|When a truss {{structure}} {{is to be}} designed two important questions should be answered. First, how should the truss that requires the minimum amount of materials look like? Second, what are the possible members 2 ̆ 7 <b>cross</b> <b>sectional</b> <b>areas</b> that support the applied load safely? In this work those two questions are answered using a two stage optimization process. In stage one, starting with hyper-connected truss ground structures that fully encompass the design region, together with specified support conditions and load cases, the discrete combinations and arrangement of truss members that will yield the lightest and stiffest structure are sought. In the second stage the minimum <b>cross</b> <b>sectional</b> <b>areas</b> of the members that satisfy the imposed constraints are sought. In both stages harmony search algorithms are employed. These represent {{one of the most}} recent heuristic, stochastic search optimization methods that, while relatively simple and robust, overcome some of the drawbacks of preceding search techniques such as: the ability to converge to a global optimum, and the ability to optimize non-differentiable and non-continuous functions. The viability of the proposed framework is documented on numerous benchmark problems from the literature...|$|R

500|$|Researchers {{studying}} the peripheral and central afferent pathways from the feline clitoris concluded that [...] "Afferent neurons projecting to the clitoris {{of the cat}} were identified by WGA-HRP tracing in the S1 and S2 dorsal root ganglia. An average of 433 cells were identified {{on each side of}} the animal. 85percent and 15percent of the labeled cells were located in the S1 and S2 dorsal root ganglia, respectively. The average <b>cross</b> <b>sectional</b> <b>area</b> of clitoral afferent neuron profiles was 1.479±627 μm2." [...] They also stated that light [...] "constant pressure on the clitoris produced an initial burst of single unit firing (maximum frequencies 170–255 Hz) followed by rapid adaptation and a sustained firing (maximum 40 Hz), which was maintained during the stimulation. Tonic firing increased to an average maximum of 145 Hz at 6–8 g/mm2 pressure" [...] and [...] "hese results indicate that the clitoris is innervated by mechano-sensitive myelinated afferent fibers in the pudental nerve which project centrally to the region of the dorsal commissure in the L7-S1 spinal cord".|$|E
500|$|The {{circulatory system}} of the giraffe has several adaptations for its great height. Its heart, which can weigh more than [...] and {{measures}} about [...] long, must generate approximately double the blood pressure required for a human to maintain {{blood flow to the}} brain. As such, the wall of the heart can be as thick as [...] Giraffes have unusually high heart rates for their size, at 150 beats per minute. When the animal lowers its head the blood rushes down fairly unopposed and a rete mirabile in the upper neck, with its large <b>cross</b> <b>sectional</b> <b>area,</b> prevents excess blood flow to the brain. When it raises again, the blood vessels constrict and direct blood into the brain so the animal does not faint. The jugular veins contain several (most commonly seven) valves to prevent blood flowing back into the head from the inferior vena cava and right atrium while the head is lowered. Conversely, the blood vessels in the lower legs are under great pressure because of the weight of fluid pressing down on them. To solve this problem, the skin of the lower legs is thick and tight; preventing too much blood from pouring into them.|$|E
500|$|Tauranac {{built the}} BT19 around a mild steel {{spaceframe}} chassis {{similar to those}} used in his previous Brabham designs. The use of a spaceframe was considered a conservative design decision; by 1966, most of Brabham's competitors were using the theoretically lighter and stiffer monocoque design, introduced to Formula One by Lotus during the 1962 season. Tauranac believed that contemporary monocoques were not usefully stiffer than a well-designed spaceframe and were harder to repair and maintain. The latter was a particular concern for Brabham, which was the largest manufacturer of customer single-seater racing cars in the world at the time. The company's reputation rested in part on BRO – effectively the official 'works' team – using the same technology as its customers, for whom ease of repair was a significant consideration. One mildly novel feature was the use of oval-section, rather than round, tubing around the cockpit, where the driver sits. In a spaceframe or monocoque racing car, the cockpit is effectively a hole in the structure, weakening it considerably. For a given <b>cross</b> <b>sectional</b> <b>area,</b> oval tubing is stiffer in one direction than round tubing. Tauranac happened to have a supply of oval tubing and used it to stiffen the cockpit area. The car weighed around 1250pounds (567kg), around [...] over the minimum weight limit for the formula, although it was still one of the lightest cars in the 1966 field. The race starting weight of a 1966 Brabham-Repco with driver and fuel was estimated to be around , about [...] less than the more powerful rival Cooper T81-Maseratis.|$|E
