5000|$|The Volkswagen Group {{mainstream}} marques used {{unit injector}} systems (branded [...] "Pumpe Düse", commonly appreviated to [...] "PD") in their Suction Diesel Injection (SDI) and Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel engines, however this fuel injection method has been superseded by a <b>common-rail</b> design, {{such as the}} new 1.6 TDI.|$|E
5000|$|In Europe the Civic {{was sold}} with a D16V1 rated at 110 hp and a D14Z6 rated at 88 hp, also a <b>common-rail</b> diesel engine {{produced}} by Isuzu Motors Polska. This engine is a 1.7L 4EE2 Circle L engine with [...] the European Type R Civic {{was equipped with}} a K20A2 ...|$|E
50|$|The engine {{driving the}} S23 Stark is a 2.3L 16V Turbodiesel Intercooler, {{unprecedented}} in Brazil, supplied by FPT - FIAT Powertrain Technologies, the largest manufacturer of propulsion systems in Latin America. The engine has four cylinders, <b>common-rail</b> direct injection and produces 127 horsepower at 3,600 rpm with a torque of 30.6 Nm at 1,800 rpm.|$|E
50|$|This same {{model was}} {{released}} in South Africa as the new Ford Ikon in September 2007. It was powered by either a 1.4-litre or a 1.6-litre petrol engine, both with double overhead camshaft and four valves per cylinder, or by a 1.4-litre <b>common-rail</b> turbodiesel engine. All three engines were coupled to a five-speed manual gearbox.|$|E
50|$|The {{descending}} piston is used {{to compress}} incoming combustion air for the adjacent cylinders. This also serves to cushion the piston as it approaches bottom dead centre (BDC), thereby removing some load from the bearings. The engine is uniflow-scavenged by way of exhaust valves that are operated by electronically controlled, <b>common-rail</b> hydraulics, thus eliminating the camshaft.|$|E
50|$|Initially the Fortuner {{was sold}} with 4 {{different}} types of 2 petrol engines and 2 diesel engines. All variants were offered in RWD or 4WD configuration, with 5-speed manual transmission and a 4 or 5-speed automatic transmission. Its high body model has been criticized as unstable, and not aerodynamic when running at higher speeds. In August 2012, the 2.5 L <b>common-rail</b> turbodiesel 2KD-FTV and the 3.0 L <b>common-rail</b> turbodiesel 1KD-FTV engine was upgraded to include a variable nozzle turbocharger (VNT) to increase power and torque about 60%, also reducing fuel consumption up to 30%. With this VNT equipment, now Fortuner can accelerate from 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) in about 11 seconds (less than 10 seconds for 3.0 L engine). It was launched to commemorate Pertamina's successful expedition from Jakarta, Indonesia to Venice, Italy (a distance of roughly 20,000 kilometers) using a group of Fortuners.|$|E
50|$|Rover Group (UK) and Steyr (Austria), worked {{together}} to modify the M47D20 to create a transverse configuration {{for use in the}} Rover 75 front wheel drive saloon, as well as their all-wheel-drive Land Rover Freelander. The same engine was later deployed by MG Rover in the Rover 75 Tourer and MG ZT. The M47R ("M47 Rail") differs from the original design by the introduction of <b>common-rail</b> technology, a transverse orientation, different turbochargers and more sophisticated systems for temperature management. However, the core 1951 cc heads of the M47R and M47D20 are the same. Combining a <b>common-rail</b> system with a relatively small engine capacity created engine temperature problems. More hardware was added to help control temperatures which also helped to escalate weight, fuel consumption, and manufacturing costs. The BMW Steyr plant manufactured and supplied M47R engines with the same power output as the M47D20 from 1999 to 2006.|$|E
50|$|A three-door variant was {{released}} for the European market in 2008. Engine choices include the MZR 1.3-liter and 1.5-liter gasoline, MZ-CD 1.4-liter <b>common-rail</b> turbo diesel. In some EU Member States like the Netherlands, {{there is the}} option to buy the gasoline car in bi-fuel LPG version from the factory. This model was unveiled at the 2008 Geneva International Motor Show.|$|E
5000|$|Cdi: has the world's {{smallest}} production <b>common-rail</b> {{direct injection}} diesel engine. With a consumption of 3.3 litres (NEDC) per 100 kilometres (71.2 mpg) and CO2 emissions of just 88 grams per kilometre, {{it has the}} lowest current production car CO2 emissions worldwide, since Audi and Volkswagen retired its 3-cylinder cars, the A2 1.2 TDI and the Lupo 1.2 TDI respectively.|$|E
