5|$|The {{physical}} {{impacts of}} ashfall {{can affect the}} operation of water treatment plants. Ash can block intake structures, cause severe abrasion damage to pump impellers and overload pump motors. Many water treatment plants have an initial coagulation/flocculation step that is automatically adjusted to turbidity (the level of suspended solids, measured in nephelometric turbidity units) in the incoming water. In most cases, changes in turbidity caused by suspended ash particles will be within the normal operating range of the plant and can be managed satisfactorily by adjusting the addition of <b>coagulant.</b> Ashfalls {{will be more likely}} to cause problems for plants that are not designed for high levels of turbidity and which may omit coagulation/flocculation treatment. Ash can enter filtration systems such as open sand filters both by direct fallout and via intake waters. In most cases, increased maintenance will be required to manage the effects of an ashfall, but there will not be service interruptions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine the coagulation efficiencies on total solids (TS) removal from semiconductor wastewater by applying various locally available starches as natural <b>coagulants.</b> Two commercial <b>coagulants</b> such as alum [Al 2 (SO 4) 3 · 18 H 2 O] and polyaluminium chloride (PAC) were also utilized in this study in order to compare the coagulation efficiency with the natural <b>coagulants.</b> The EDX analysis of the raw semiconductor wastewater showed that it contained silica dioxide (SiO 2) with a concentration of 90 %. It appeared that the natural <b>coagulants</b> employed in the study have similar coagulation characteristics with the commercial <b>coagulants.</b> However, the natural <b>coagulants</b> possess better metal adsorption capability than the commercial <b>coagulants.</b> A 3 level factorial experimental design was used in the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) analysis and indicated that starches are capable to remove TS from the semiconductor wastewater and the removal performance were almost similar to alum and higher than PAC.

30|$|Because {{of these}} {{inherent}} disadvantages {{of the chemical}} <b>coagulants,</b> search for alternative <b>coagulants</b> becomes imperative. Natural <b>coagulants</b> have attracted more attention due to their eco-friendliness. Natural <b>coagulants</b> are considered safe for human health, because they are biodegradable, natural, nontoxic, and renewable (Zhao et al. 2012; Rajab et al. 2013).These natural <b>coagulants</b> of plant origin include, {{but are not limited}} to, Moringa oleifera, Maize, Nirmali (Strychnos potatorum) seed, Plantago psyllium, Plantago ovata, Hibiscus esculentus seed pods, Chestnut, Jatropha curcas seeds (Sen and Bulusu 1962; Tripathi et al. 1976; Raghuwanshi et al. 2002; Oluwalana et al. 2004; Mei Fong et al. 2014; Sciban et al. 2009).

Plant <b>coagulants</b> had shorter gelation time (tg) at 25 °C, 35 °C and 40 °C, and higher initial rate of increase in G' values at all temperatures tested. The firmest gels at long ageing times were produced by chymosin at 30 °C and 32 °C. At a gelation temperature of 25 °C, the differences in rheological and microstructural characteristics between plant <b>coagulants</b> and chymosin were considerable; plant <b>coagulants</b> had shorter tg and higher G' values.

40|$|Aims: In this study, {{the effect}} of the {{coagulation}} process on treatment of simulated dairy wastewater (SDW) was investigated using the mineral and organic <b>coagulants.</b> Materials and Methods: Different types of <b>coagulants</b> such as inorganic (Alum and ferrous sulphate) and polymeric <b>coagulants</b> (polyacrylamide [PAA] and polyferric sulphate [PFS]) were investigated. Inorganic <b>coagulants</b> dosages were varied from 100 to 1000 mg/L and the polymers dosage was 20 mg/L. Turbidity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), electrical conductivity (EC) and chloride of samples were investigated in optimum pH. Results: Both two <b>coagulants</b> had an optimum dose and pH of 1000 mg/L and 5 respectively. According to the findings, Alum with 95 % turbidity removal and 68 % COD removal had more high efficiency than ferrous sulphate (95 % and 62 % efficiency for turbidity and COD removal respectively). When Alum via PFS and PAA as a <b>coagulants</b> aid were used, 82 % decrease in COD was obtained using low dose of Alum (100 mg/L). Conclusion: In studied dairy wastewater, Alum was more effective than ferrous sulphate.

40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{an investigation}} on and {{comparison of the}} coagulation performances of aluminium, iron and zirconium <b>coagulants</b> on real wastewater collected in Norway. This work was carried out from January 2014 to May 2014. Coagulation {{is an essential part}} of drinking water treatment as well as wastewater treatment. Aluminium and iron <b>coagulants</b> have been in use for many years as part of wastewater treatment. In recent years however, research has been focused on other new <b>coagulants</b> such as zirconium <b>coagulants.</b> This is because regulatory requirements for wastewater treatment are going to become stricter in the future throughout the world. At the same time, wastewater is becoming more difficult to treat due to the presence of new manmade compounds. Thus the continued use of traditional aluminium and iron <b>coagulants</b> may not be able to meet the stricter standards required. This thesis presents an overview of the coagulation performances of aluminium, iron and zirconium <b>coagulants</b> on various ratios of mixed greywater and blackwater collected from the wastewater collection point at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences in Norway. Analysis and comparison was done using jar tests with two initial wastewater pH values of 6. 0 and 7. 5. The removal efficiencies of removing orthophosphates, total suspended solids and turbidity were analysed and compared. It was found that zirconium <b>coagulants</b> had the best treatment efficiencies and the least dosages in all types of wastewaters analysed.

Transdermal estradiol has less-pronounced effects on these proteins and, in contrast to oral estradiol, reduces triglycerides. Through these effects, both oral and transdermal estrogens can protect against atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease in menopausal women with intact arterial endothelium that is without severe lesions.|$|E

25|$|Early (1973) {{evaluations}} of the processes for removing dissolved arsenic from drinking water demonstrated the efficacy of co-precipitation with either iron or aluminum oxides. In particular, iron as a <b>coagulant</b> was found to remove arsenic with an efficacy exceeding 90%. Several adsorptive media systems have been approved for use at point-of-service in a study funded by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). A team of European and Indian scientists and engineers have set up six arsenic treatment plants in West Bengal based on in-situ remediation method (SAR Technology). This technology does not use any chemicals and arsenic is left in an insoluble form (+5 state) in the subterranean zone by recharging aerated water into the aquifer and developing an oxidation zone that supports arsenic oxidizing micro-organisms. This process does not produce any waste stream or sludge and is relatively cheap.|$|E
25|$|The {{prostate}} {{is found}} {{as a male}} accessory gland in all placental mammals excepting edentates, martens, badgers and otters. The prostate glands of male marsupials are proportionally larger than those of placental mammals. In some marsupial species, {{the size of the}} prostate gland changes seasonally. The structure of the prostate varies, ranging from tubuloalveolar (as in humans) to branched tubular. The gland is particularly well developed in dogs, foxes and boars, though in other mammals, such as bulls, it can be small and inconspicuous. Dogs can produce in one hour as much prostatic fluid as a human can in a day. They excrete this fluid along with their urine to mark their territory. In many rodents and bats, the prostatic fluid contains a <b>coagulant.</b> This mixes with and coagulates semen during copulation to form a mating plug that temporarily prevents further copulation.

500|$|At the Beecher's facility, their {{process for}} cheese {{manufacturing}} is multi-staged. Thousands {{of gallons of}} milk are hose-fed from delivery trucks into the manufacturing area, where it is heated to complete the pasteurization of the milk. The heated milk is processed into a stainless steel trough, and the temperature further increased, while the first live cheese cultures and rennet, a <b>coagulant,</b> {{are added to the}} developing mixture. According to Amir Rosenblatt, a cheesemaker at Beecher's, the heating and cheese temperatures used in their cooking process are tightly controlled through the sustainable technology of steam power. [...] "A variation of half a degree [...] can change the flavor of the cheese," [...] he said. Cheesemakers use stainless steel [...] "rakes" [...] to then gather the milk mixture, before allowing it to settle briefly, at which point the cheese is cut repeatedly by hand until it achieves a yogurt-like texture and substance. This process is repeated often, until a desired consistency is reached. The mixture is then drawn away to a new trough where most of the remaining water and whey is drained from the cheese. While the whey is continually pulled from the cheese, cheesemakers constantly separate the cheese by hand into smaller and small stacks of cheese curds, which form as the whey is removed. To complete the curding, a large amount of salt is added to cure the cheese and draw still more whey from it. The curds are finally cut into portions, filled into cheese molds, stacked on top of each other, and the remaining excess moisture is forced from the cheese with a constant [...] of pressure for at least 24 hours, before the finished cheese is stored to age. For every 10 pounds (10 kilograms) of milk and whey, Beecher's will typically create 1 pound (1 kilogram) of finished cheese.|$|E
