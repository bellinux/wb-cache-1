50|$|In human anatomy, {{there are}} three types of chief cells, the gastric <b>chief</b> <b>cell,</b> the {{parathyroid}} <b>chief</b> <b>cell,</b> and the type 1 chief cells found in the carotid body.|$|E
5000|$|In many way, <b>chief</b> <b>cell</b> {{hyperplasia}} {{is similar}} to parathyroid adenoma. The hyperplasia {{is seen as an}} enlargement of all four of the parathyroid glands, as opposed to a parathyroid adenoma is viewed as an enlargement of one gland. [...] <b>Chief</b> <b>cell</b> hyperplasia is a common disorder in individuals with other endocrine abnormalities, though it may still occur sporadically. A <b>chief</b> <b>cell</b> hyperplasia can develop from either a primary or secondary cause.|$|E
50|$|Gastric chief {{cells are}} {{epithelial}} cells which are {{found within the}} gastric unit or gastric gland, and form {{the base of the}} gastric unit. The gastric <b>chief</b> <b>cell</b> has an extensive network of lamellar rough endoplasmic reticulum organized around the nucleus. The gastric <b>chief</b> <b>cell</b> also contains many large secretory vesicles filled with digestive enzymes in the apical cytoplasm.|$|E
5000|$|Parathyroid <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> (also called {{parathyroid}} principal {{cells or}} simply parathyroid cells) {{are one of}} the two cell types of the parathyroid glands, along with oxyphil <b>cells.</b> [...] The <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> are much more prevalent in the parathyroid gland than the oxyphil cells. It is perceived that oxyphil cells may be derived from <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> at puberty, as they are not present at birth like <b>chief</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gastric <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> are {{primarily}} activated by ACh. However {{the decrease in}} pH caused by activation of parietal cells further activates gastric <b>chief</b> <b>cells.</b> Alternatively, acid in the duodenum can stimulate S cells to secrete secretin which acts on an endocrine path to activate gastric <b>chief</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
40|$|The normal parathyroids of six {{humans and}} a Virginia deer were studied by light and {{electron}} microscopy. The parenchyma {{of the deer}} parathyroid is composed of uniform <b>chief</b> <b>cells,</b> which contained 100 to 400 m # electron-opaque, membrane-limited granules, presumed to be secretory granules, {{in addition to the}} usual cytoplasmic organellcs. Desmosomes are present between adjacent cells, and rare cilia are observed protruding from the <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> into the intercellular space. The human parathyroids contain <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> in two phases-active and inactive [...] as well as oxyphil <b>cells.</b> Active <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> have a large Golgi apparatus, sparse glycogen, numerous secretory granules, and rare cilia. Inactive <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> contain a small Golgi apparatus, abundant glycogen, and few secretory granules. Both forms have the usual cytoplasmic organellcs and, between adjacent cells, desmosomes. Oxyphil cell cytoplasm is composed of tightly packed mitochondria and glycogen granules, with rare secretory granules.

5000|$|Gastric pit {{cells are}} {{replaced}} every 2-4 days. This {{high rate of}} turnover is a protective mechanism {{designed to protect the}} epithelial lining of the stomach from both the proteolytic action of pepsin and the acid produced by parietal cells. Gastric chief cells are much longer lived and are believed to differentiate from stem cells located higher in the gastric unit in the isthmus. [...] These stem cells differentiate into mucous neck cells in the isthmus and transition into chief cells as they migrate towards the base. Since the mucus neck cells do not divide as it becomes a <b>chief</b> <b>cell</b> this process is known as transdifferentiation. The gene Mist1 has been shown to regulate mucus neck cell to <b>chief</b> <b>cell</b> transdifferentiation and plays a role in the normal development of the <b>chief</b> <b>cell</b> organelles and structures.|$|E
50|$|The gastric <b>chief</b> <b>cell</b> (also {{known as}} a zymogenic cell or peptic cell) is a cell in the stomach that {{releases}} pepsinogen and chymosin. Pepsinogen is activated into the digestive enzyme pepsin when it comes in contact with acid produced by gastric parietal cells. This type of cell also secretes gastric lipase enzymes, which help digest triglycerides into free fatty acids and di- and mono-glycerides. There is also evidence that the gastric <b>chief</b> <b>cell</b> secretes leptin {{in response to the}} presence of food in the stomach. Leptin has been found in the pepsinogen granules of chief cells.|$|E
50|$|Parathyroid <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> {{make up the}} {{majority}} of the parathyroid gland along with adipocytes and oxyphil <b>cells.</b> Parathyroid <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> have large amounts of organelles associated with protein synthesis.

40|$|SummaryProliferation of the self-renewing {{epithelium}} of the gastric corpus occurs {{almost exclusively}} in the isthmus of the glands, from where cells migrate bidirectionally toward pit and base. The isthmus is therefore generally viewed as the stem cell zone. We find that the stem cell marker Troy is expressed at the gland base by a small subpopulation of fully differentiated <b>chief</b> <b>cells.</b> By lineage tracing with a Troy-eGFP-ires-CreERT 2 allele, single marked <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> are shown to generate entirely labeled gastric units over periods of months. This phenomenon accelerates upon tissue damage. Troy+ <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> can be cultured to generate long-lived gastric organoids. Troy marks a specific subset of <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> that display plasticity {{in that they are}} capable of replenishing entire gastric units, essentially serving as quiescent “reserve” stem cells. These observations challenge the notion that stem cell hierarchies represent a “one-way street. ...|$|R
5000|$|The terms <b>chief</b> <b>cell</b> and zymogenic cell {{are often}} used without the word [...] "gastric" [...] to name this type of cell. However those terms {{can also be used}} to {{describe}} other cell types (for example, parathyroid chief cells). Chief cells are also known as peptic cells.|$|E
50|$|The {{parathyroid}} <b>chief</b> <b>cell</b> is {{the primary}} cell of the parathyroid gland. It produces and secretes parathyroid hormone in response to low calcium levels. PTH {{plays an important role}} in regulating blood calcium levels by raising the amount of calcium in the blood. Parathyroid tissue seems to have a low turn-over rate.|$|E
5000|$|Chief cells {{spend most}} time {{inactive}} due to normal calcium level conditions. These inactive cells {{are classified as}} cuboidal. They have low levels of secretory granules, as opposed to active chief cells. These granules can contain acid phosphatase. Acid phosphatase is only found in larger secretory granules, 400 to 900 nm in diameter, and is less prevalent in smaller granules. This acid phosphatase is also present in the Golgi apparatus of the <b>chief</b> <b>cell.</b> However, the Golgi apparatus areas associated with parathyroid hormone packaging contained little or no acid phosphatase. [...] The chief cells become active in response to low calcium in the blood. The low level is sensed by the calcium- sensing receptor. These active cells have a greater electron density than the inactive chief cells. [...] The electron density {{is caused by the}} secretory granules. The <b>chief</b> <b>cell</b> is thought to have a clear cytoplasm.|$|E
40|$|Fine {{structural}} alterations of thyroid C <b>cells</b> and parathyroid <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> {{were evaluated}} after feeding dried {{leaves of the}} calcinogenic plant, Solanum malacoxylon, to cattle for 1, 6 and 32 days. Thyroid C cells initially were degranulated {{in response to the}} hypercalcemia, and parathyroid <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> accumulated secretory granules. There was hypertrophy of thyroid C cells with well-developed secretory organelles but few secretory granules in the cytoplasm after 6 days of feeding S. malacoxylon. Inactive <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> with dispersed profiles of endoplasmic reticulum and increased lysosomal bodies predominated in the parathyroid glands. Multiple foci of soft tissue mineralization were present in the heart, lung, and kidney. Thyroid C cells underwent hypertrophy and hyperplasia after 32 days of S. malacoxylon, and parathyroid <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> were inactive or atrophic in response to the long-term hypercalcemia. Severe soft tissue mineralization was present throughout the cardiovascular system, lung, kidney, and spleen. These ultrastructural changes in thyroid C <b>cells</b> and parathyroid <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> plus the widespread soft tissue mineralization observed after feeding cattle small amounts of S. malacoxylon are consistent with the recent evidence that leaves of this plant are a potent source of the active metabolite, 1, 25 -dihydroxycholecalciferol, of vitamin D...|$|R

The immunoreactivity for TrkA was detected in most of <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> and sustentacular cells, {{as well as in}} some nerve axons and perineurial cells, but not in Schwann cells. In electron microscopy, the immunoreactivity was localized to the cytoplasm. The mRNA for NGF was localized to most of <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> and possibly also to sustentacular cells.

5000|$|A gastric <b>chief</b> <b>cell</b> (or peptic cell, or gastric zymogenic cell) {{is a type}} of cell in {{the stomach}} that {{releases}} pepsinogen and gastric lipase and is the cell responsible for secretion of chymosin in ruminants. The cell stains basophilic upon H&E staining due to the large proportion of rough endoplasmic reticulum in its cytoplasm. Gastric chief cells are generally located deep in the mucosal layer of the stomach lining.|$|E
50|$|In gastric tissue, {{a loss of}} parietal cells due {{to chronic}} {{inflammation}} {{has been shown to}} affect <b>chief</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation and can induce chief cells to transdifferentiate back into neck cells and can lead to the formation of mucus cell metaplasia known as spasmolytic polypeptide expressing metaplasia (SPEM) that could be precancerous. If parietal cells are lost, mature chief cells do not form. Parietal cells may secrete factors that lead to transdifferentiation of chief cells, so if lost, chief cells do not normally develop.|$|E

50|$|Cinacalcet is a {{drug that}} acts as a calcimimetic (i.e. it mimics the action of calcium on tissues) by {{allosteric}} activation of the calcium-sensing receptor that is expressed in various human organ tissues. The calcium-sensing receptors {{on the surface of the}} <b>chief</b> <b>cell</b> of the parathyroid gland is the principal regulator of parathyroid hormone secretion. Cinacalcet increases the sensitivity of calcium receptors on parathyroid cells to reduce parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and thus decrease serum calcium levels. As receptors are already active from the calcimimetic (cinacalcet) the native rise and fall of calcium levels now interact with the remaining receptors, effectively lowering the threshold for activation of feedback on the parathyroid chief cells.|$|E
50|$|Tc99m-sestamibi {{is absorbed}} faster by a hyperfunctioning {{parathyroid}} gland than by a normal parathyroid gland. This {{is dependent on}} several histologic features within the abnormal parathyroid gland itself. Sestamibi imaging is correlated with the number and activity of the mitochondria within the parathyroid cells, such that oxyphil cell parathyroid adenomas {{have a very high}} avidity for sestamibi, while <b>chief</b> <b>cell</b> parathyroid adenomas have almost no imaging quality at all with sestambi. Some researchers have also attempted to quantify or characterize the imaging capabilities of parathyroid glands by the MDR gene expression. Approximately 60 percent of parathyroid adenomas may be imaged by sestamibi scanning. The natural distribution of etiologic causation for primary hyperparathyroidism is roughly 85% solitary adenomas, 10-15% diffuse hyperplasia, and 1% cancer.|$|E
50|$|The first {{immunologic}} {{model was}} called the Self Non-self model and was suggested by Burnet and Frank Fenner in 1949, and refined over the years. It supposes that the immune system distinguishes between self, which is tolerated, and between non-self, which is attacked and destroyed. According to this theory the <b>chief</b> <b>cell</b> {{of the immune system}} is the B lymphocyte, which is activated when it recognizes any non-self structure. Later it was discovered that in order to become activated, the B lymphocyte needs help from a CD4+ T helper cell, and that this T helper cell in turn also required a co-stimulatory signal from an antigen-presenting cell (APC) to be activated. The Self Non-self model developed according to these findings. Because APC cells are not antigen specific and are also capable of processing self structures, in 1989 Charles Janeway proposed a new theory, the so-called Infectious Non-self Model. It is {{based on the idea that}} APCs are activated via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which recognize evolutionary distant conserved patterns. These pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on such organisms as bacteria are recognized as infectious non-self, whereas PRRs are not activated by non-infectious self. However, none of these models can explain non-cytopathic virus infections, graft rejection or anti-tumor immunity.|$|E
40|$|The orderly {{differentiation}} of cell lineages within gastric glands is regulated by a complicated interplay of local mucosal growth factors and hormones. Histamine secreted from enterochromaffin-like cells {{plays an important}} role in not only stimulated gastric acid secretion but also coordination of intramucosal growth and lineage differentiation. We have examined histidine-decarboxylase (HDC) -deficient mice, which lack endogenous histamine synthesis, to evaluate the influence of histamine on {{differentiation of}} fundic mucosal lineages and the development of metaplasia following induction of acute oxyntic atrophy. Stomachs from HDC-deficient mice and wild-type mice were evaluated at 8 wk and 12 mo of age. DMP- 777 was administrated orally to 6 -wk-old mice for 1 to 14 days. Sections of gastric mucosa were stained with antibodies against Mist 1, intrinsic factor, H/K-ATPase, trefoil factor 2 (TFF 2), chromogranin A, and Ext 1 and for the cell cycle marker phospho-histone H 3. HDC-deficient mice at 8 wk of age demonstrated a prominent increase in <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> expressing Mist 1 and intrinsic factor. Importantly Mist 1 -positive mature <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> were present in the midgland region as well as at the bases of fundic glands, indicating a premature differentiation of <b>chief</b> <b>cells.</b> Mice dually deficient for both HDC and gastrin showed a normal distribution of <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> in fundic glands. Treatment of HDC-deficient mice with DMP- 777 led to loss of parietal cells and an accelerated and exaggerated emergence of mucous cell metaplasia with the presence of dual intrinsic factor and TFF 2 -expressing cells throughout the gland length, indicative of the emergence of spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM) from <b>chief</b> <b>cells.</b> These findings indicate that histamine, in concert with gastrin, regulates the appropriate differentiation of <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> from mucous neck cells as they migrate toward the bases of fundic glands. Nevertheless, histamine is not required for emergence of SPEM following acute oxyntic atrophy...|$|R
40|$|The role of adrenal and thyroid hormones on the {{development}} of <b>chief</b> and parietal <b>cells</b> was studied in the rat. Administration of corticosterone or thyroxine in the first and second postnatal weeks resulted in the precocious appearance of pepsinogen in the oxyntic gland mucosa and an increase in basal acid output. When pups were adrenalectomized or made hypothyroid, both pepsinogen and basal acid secretion were lowed. Corticosterone injection increased pepsinogen content and acid secretion to levels higher than those of control in hypothyroid and adrenalectomized rats while thyroxine had no such effect in adrenalectomized rats. Morphologically, <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> responded to corticosterone or thyroxine with increases in both zymogen granules and RER. <b>Chief</b> <b>cells,</b> however, contained less zymogen granules and RER in adrenalectomized and hypothyroid rats. Corticosterone was effective in restoring the normal morphological appearance of <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> in the hypothyroid rats while thyroxine had no effect in the adrenalectomized rats. In response to corticosterone or thyroxine, parietal cells in normal animals appeared to contain more mitochondria, tubulovesicles and intracellular canaliculi than those of control. Unlike <b>chief</b> <b>cells,</b> parietal cells retained normal ultrastructure in the absence of adrenal and thyroid hormones. These data indicate that (1) corticosterone is necessary for the functional and morphological development of chief cells; (2) the morphological development of parietal cells does not appear to depend upon corticosterone, (3) the effect of thyroxine on {{the development}} of <b>chief</b> and parietal <b>cells</b> is due to corticosterone. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{potential}} pathogenetic {{significance of}} mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in tumorigenesis is controversial. We hypothesized that benign tumorigenesis of a slowly replicating tissue like the human parathyroid might constitute an especially fertile ground {{on which a}} selective advantage conferred by mtDNA mutation could be manifested and might contribute to the oxyphilic phenotype observed in a subset of parathyroid tumors. Methods We sought acquired mitochondrial DNA mutations by sequencing the entire 16. 6 kb mitochondrial genome of each of thirty sporadic parathyroid adenomas (18 <b>chief</b> <b>cell</b> and 12 oxyphil cell), eight independent, polyclonal, parathyroid primary <b>chief</b> <b>cell</b> hyperplasias plus corresponding normal control samples, five normal parathyroid glands, and one normal thyroid gland. Results Twenty-seven somatic mutations were identified in 15 of 30 (9 of 12 oxyphil adenomas, 6 of 18 <b>chief</b> <b>cell)</b> parathyroid adenomas studied. No somatic mutations were observed in the hyperplastic parathyroid glands. Conclusion Features of the somatic mutations suggest that they may confer a selective advantage {{and contribute to the}} molecular pathogenesis of parathyroid adenomas. Importantly, the statistically significant differences in mutation prevalence in oxyphil vs. <b>chief</b> <b>cell</b> adenomas also suggest that mtDNA mutations may contribute to the oxyphil phenotype. </p...|$|E

40|$|Microtubule {{involvement}} in secretory {{events of the}} parathyroid gland was investigated in rats treated with colchicine and/or phosphorus, agents which {{have been shown to}} modify parathyroid secretion. Quantitative ultrastructural techniques were used in an effort to assess the cytoplasmic microtubule and secretory granule content of <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> 3 h after treatment, when hypocalcemia was well established. After cochicine administration, the <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> appeared to have lost all assembled microtubules and accumulated greater than normal amounts of cytoplasmic secretory granules. On the other hand, phosphorus treatment was associated with increased microtubule content although the cytoplasmic content of secretory granules remained unchanged. When colchicine and phosphorus were given concomitantly, microtubules were again absent, but the secretory granule content of the cells was markedly increased. These data provide direct evidence that colchicine disrupts assembled microtubules in <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> of rat parathyroids; the consequence of this effect appears to be a blockage of hormone release which is reflected in the accumulation of secretory granules in the cell. The fact that microtubules also show a significant increase in content when hormone release from <b>chief</b> <b>cells</b> is presumed to increase, suggests that microtubules may participate in the physiological control of parathyroid hormone secretion...|$|R
