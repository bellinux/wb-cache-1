5|$|Tucker {{began her}} service in 1936. Following shakedown, the new {{destroyer}} {{was assigned to}} the United States Battle Fleet in San Diego, California, operating along the West <b>Coast</b> <b>and</b> in the Hawaiian Islands. She participated in naval exercises in the Caribbean Sea, and was then reassigned to duty between the West <b>Coast</b> <b>and</b> Hawaii. After a goodwill tour to New Zealand, the ship returned to Pearl Harbor. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7December 1941, Tucker was berthed at the East Loch in Pearl Harbor undergoing overhaul but sustained no damage. Afterward, Tucker escorted convoys between the West <b>Coast</b> <b>and</b> Hawaii. She then did escort work to American Samoa, the Fiji Islands, New Caledonia, and Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides.|$|E

5|$|AJ tankers {{were used}} to refuel John Glenn's Vought F8U-1P Crusader during the Project Bullet transcontinental speed record flight in July 1957; AJ-2s from VAH-6 on the West <b>Coast</b> <b>and</b> AJ-1s from VAH-11 on the East Coast. Beginning in 1957 the Douglas A3D Skywarrior began to replace the Savages in the VAH Squadrons. Their {{refueling}} role was continued by the formation in January 1958 of VAH-15 on East <b>Coast</b> <b>and</b> VAH-16 on the West Coast. Both squadrons were equipped with AJ-2s, but both were short-lived and disbanded early the following year.|$|E

Between 1902 and 1904 he was employed by the East Africa Syndicate, for which he led a vast mineral prospecting expedition in the East Africa Protectorate (Kenya).

5|$|As {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} in California since the 1989 Loma Prieta event several years earlier, the mainshock caused a non-destructive tsunami that quickly reached the <b>coast,</b> <b>and</b> eventually Alaska and Hawaii several hours later. The tsunami was significant {{not because of}} its run-up, {{but because of the}} speed with which it reached the <b>coast</b> <b>and</b> for how long the waves persisted. Other strong earthquakes have affected the same area, with some that were clearly associated with the (interplate) Mendocino Fracture Zone, and others (like the two shocks on April 26) were intraplate earthquakes that ruptured within the Gorda Plate, but events that are unequivocally associated with the Cascadia subduction zone are very infrequent.|$|E
