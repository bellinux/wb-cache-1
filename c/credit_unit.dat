Respondents were 100 CPAs from Davao City fairly distributed as to age, sex, sector connected, year working and <b>credit</b> <b>unit</b> earned. The study covered periods 2010 - 2013. The paper employed descriptive-quantitative design and used a validated, self-construct questionnaire as instrument. The sampling technique employed was stratified. Data were gathered through survey and personal interview. The statistical treatments used were frequency, mean, ANOVA and logistical regression. The critical alpha was set at. 05 level of significance. Results revealed that majority of active CPD participants were young, female CPAs. The extent of participation was found minimum. The overall level of contribution of CPD to career advancement was held negligible although CPD showed strongest impact on improvement of financial income and weakest on enhancement of personal competencies. Further, {{the study found that}} no significant difference exists between the level of CPD contribution and career advancement of CPA when grouped according to profile. This suggests that demographics such as age, sex, sector belonged and working years have no statistical impact on the level of CPD contribution.

The primary incentive provided by the BOINC Accounting System is the award of 'credits', which themselves have no monetary value.
