5|$|Many {{immigrants}} openly flouted Mexican law, {{especially the}} prohibition against slavery. Combined with United States' attempts to purchase Texas, Mexican authorities decided in 1830 to prohibit continued immigration from the United States. New laws {{also called for}} the enforcement of <b>customs</b> <b>duties</b> angering both native Mexican citizens (Tejanos) and recent immigrants.|$|E
5|$|During the 1830s, the Mexican {{government}} wavered between federalist and centralist policies. As {{the pendulum}} swung sharply towards centralism in 1835, several Mexican states revolted. In June, {{a small group}} of settlers in Texas used the political unrest as an excuse to rebel against <b>customs</b> <b>duties,</b> in an incident known as the Anahuac Disturbances. The federal government responded by sending more troops to Texas.|$|E

50|$|A <b>customs</b> <b>duty</b> or due is the {{indirect}} tax levied on the {{import or export}} of goods in international trade. In economic sense, a duty is also a kind of consumption tax. A duty levied on goods being imported {{is referred to as}} an import duty. Similarly, a duty levied on exports is called an export duty. A tariff, which is actually a list of commodities along with the leviable rate (amount) of <b>customs</b> <b>duty,</b> is popularly referred to as a <b>customs</b> <b>duty.</b>|$|R
5|$|Economic {{globalization}} grew under free trade, {{starting in}} 1860 when the United Kingdom {{entered into a}} free trade agreement with France known as the Cobden–Chevalier Treaty. However, the golden age of this wave of globalization endured a return to protectionism between 1880 and 1914. In 1879, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced protective tariffs on agricultural and manufacturing goods, making Germany the first nation to institute new protective trade policies. In 1892, France introduced the Méline tariff, greatly raising <b>customs</b> <b>duties</b> on both agricultural and manufacturing goods. The United States maintained strong protectionism during most of the nineteenth century, imposing <b>customs</b> <b>duties</b> between 40 and 50% on imported goods. Despite these measures, international trade continued to grow without slowing. Paradoxically, foreign trade grew at a much faster rate during the protectionist phase of the first wave of globalization than during the free trade phase sparked by the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|King Ladislaus promulgated {{laws that}} {{prescribed}} draconian punishments against criminals. His laws also regulated {{the payment of}} <b>customs</b> <b>duties,</b> of tolls payable at fairs and fords, and of the tithes. He forbade Jews from holding Christian serfs, and introduced laws aiming at the conversion of local Muslims, who were known as Böszörménys.|$|E
5|$|The primary tax of {{this period}} was named bojakapati (grain tax) and charged for land used for cultivation. A water tax, named dakapati was also charged for the water used from reservoirs. <b>Customs</b> <b>duties</b> were also imposed in ports. Those unable to pay these taxes in cash were {{expected}} {{to take part in}} services such as repairing reservoirs. The administration of taxes was the duty of Badagarika, the king's treasurer.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} {{concern for}} Barnes, when {{returning from the}} United Kingdom to Australia, was to avoid paying <b>customs</b> <b>duties</b> on the enormous amount of goods he acquired through various deals during the tour. This included good quality English cloth, in very short supply in Australia at this time. Hearing a rumour that Customs officials were waiting in Sydney for him, Barnes disembarked at Melbourne and travelled to Sydney by train. The move worked and he sold his stock at a substantial profit, conservatively estimated to be equal to his tour fee.|$|E
5|$|In April 1999, Bhutto and Zardari {{were convicted}} for {{receiving}} indemnities from a Swiss goods inspection {{company that was}} hired to end corruption {{in the collection of}} <b>customs</b> <b>duties.</b> The couple received a fine of $8.6 million. Both were also sentenced to five years imprisonment, but Bhutto could not be extradited back to Pakistan from her self-imposed exile. Zardari was already in jail awaiting trial on separate charges. The evidence used against them had been gathered by Swiss investigators and the Pakistani Bureau of Accountability.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's {{claim of}} tour harmony and player loyalty in 1948 {{was thrown into}} a {{different}} light by events less than four years later. The opening batsman Sid Barnes—a core member of the 1948 team—was seeking a return to Test cricket. Barnes was known for being a somewhat eccentric self-promoter. During the 1948 tour, Barnes organised a multitude of business deals while not playing cricket, and avoided paying <b>customs</b> <b>duties</b> on the enormous amount of goods he acquired in Britain by disembarking at Melbourne instead of Sydney.|$|E

5|$|Public {{opinion in}} Texas was divided. Editorials in the United States began advocating {{complete}} independence for Texas. After several men staged a minor revolt against <b>customs</b> <b>duties</b> in Anahuac in June, local leaders began {{calling for a}} public meeting {{to determine whether a}} majority of settlers favored independence, a return to federalism, or the status quo. Although some leaders worried that Mexican officials would see this type of gathering as a step towards revolution, by the end of August most communities had agreed to send delegates to the Consultation, scheduled for October 15.|$|E
5|$|The North-West Mounted Police set up control posts at {{the borders}} of the Yukon Territory or, where that was disputed, at easily {{controlled}} points such as the Chilkoot and White Passes. These units were armed with Maxim guns. Their tasks included enforcing the rules requiring that travellers bring a year's supply of food with them to be allowed into the Yukon Territory, checking for illegal weapons, preventing the entry of criminals and enforcing <b>customs</b> <b>duties.</b>|$|E
5|$|State {{revenues}} were also raised by collecting produce from arable lands, timber from forests, and taxes on {{imports and exports}} at harbors. Some mines, groves, agricultural lands, and forests belonging to the Macedonian state were exploited by the Macedonian king, although these were often leased as assets or given as grants {{to members of the}} nobility such as the hetairoi and philoi. Tariffs exacted on goods flowing in and out of Macedonian seaports existed from at least the reign of AmyntasIII, and Callistratus of Aphidnae (d.c.350BC) aided PerdiccasIII in doubling the kingdom's annual profits on <b>customs</b> <b>duties</b> from 20 to 40 talents.|$|E

5|$|The Coast and Maritime Traffic Command {{comprised}} three naval commands for the northern, {{central and}} southern sections of the Adriatic coast, headquartered at Crikvenica (later Sušak), Makarska (later Split) and Dubrovnik respectively. These commands were further divided into naval districts; North Adriatic Naval Command was divided into the Kraljevica and Senj Naval Districts, Central Adriatic Naval Command comprised the Omiš, Supertar, Makarska, Metković and Hvar Naval Districts, and South Adriatic Naval Command consisted of the Trpanj, Orebić and Dubrovnik Naval Districts. The naval districts consisted mainly of naval and weather stations, and were only responsible for coast guard and <b>customs</b> <b>duties.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{borders in}} the region had been disputed since the American {{purchase}} of Alaska from Russia in 1867, {{and most of the}} influx of prospectors were American. Amid fresh concerns that the United States might annex the gold fields, the mounted police were tasked to assert Canadian control along the border line. The force set up control posts at the borders of the Yukon and at easily controlled mountain passes, equipping the posts with Maxim guns. The police checked for illegal weapons and prevented the entry of criminals and collected <b>customs</b> <b>duties,</b> while helping protect and guide the flow of migrants, mediating in their disputes and providing practical advice.|$|E
5|$|After the Klondike Gold Rush, {{the mounted}} police {{continued}} to spread their network of posts across the far north. In 1903, a small team of police under Inspector Charles Constantine {{were sent to}} Herschel Island to investigate the alleged sexual mistreatment of Inuit women by the transient whaling community there; the decision was also driven by fears that the United States might try to assert sovereignty over the wider Mackenzie Delta. The police {{found no evidence of}} sexual abuse, but took the opportunity to collect <b>customs</b> <b>duties</b> and to attempt to clamp down on liquor sales to the indigenous community. The same year, a well-publicised Canadian expedition was sent to Hudson Bay on the schooner SS Neptune, including Superintendent John Moodie and a small team of mounted police.|$|E

5|$|Although {{this period}} had been productive, the bad weather {{had such a}} {{detrimental}} effect on Chopin's health that Sand determined to leave the island. To avoid further <b>customs</b> <b>duties,</b> Sand sold the piano to a local French couple, the Canuts. The group traveled first to Barcelona, then to Marseilles, where they stayed {{for a few months}} while Chopin convalesced. In May 1839 they headed for the summer to Sand's estate at Nohant, where they spent most summers until 1846. In autumn they returned to Paris, where Chopin's apartment at 5 rue Tronchet was close to Sand's rented accommodation at the rue Pigalle. He frequently visited Sand in the evenings, but both retained some independence. In 1842 he and Sand moved to the Square d'Orléans, living in adjacent buildings.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} in Hawaii, gold coins brought a premium over their face value if {{purchased}} with silver; only gold {{could be used for}} certain transactions, such as paying <b>customs</b> <b>duties.</b> Silver had been heavily imported into the kingdom in the 1870s despite government efforts to slow the flow with taxes, and thus gold was more expensive there in terms of silver than in the United States, which was more stable monetarily. Any large influx of silver into circulation, such as by the Kalākaua coins, meant that silver {{in the hands of the}} public might become worth less in terms of gold. In 1883, Hawaii was in a recession, due in part to a fall in sugar prices because of overproduction.|$|E
5|$|Commissioned {{officers}} were paid a respectable wage for the period; an inspector in 1886 earned an annual salary of $1,000. Early in the force's history, additional payments {{were made to}} officers for successfully collecting <b>customs</b> <b>duties</b> and seizing illegal goods; Superintendent Leif Crozier was paid a bonus of $3,659 in 1886, for example. Once an officer had purchased items such as their uniform, which would cost around $500, and maintained a presence at key social events, however, this salary was thinly stretched. Most officers {{found it difficult to}} support a family on their police income alone, and either relied on their private wealth, or took on additional paid roles and government offices. Commissioned {{officers were}} members of the civil service pension scheme, but this was increasingly regarded as inadequate and their pension provisions were reformed in 1902.|$|E
40|$|Tariff {{receipts}} {{represent a}} significant share of {{many developing countries}} public finance receipts, {{and they can be}} though of as more easily collected than many other taxes. Still, <b>custom</b> <b>duties</b> can be evaded through a number of ways, from bribery to smuggling and fallacious declarations. Such possible tax evasion is likely to depend both on the institutional framework, on the quality of law enforcement, but also on the level and distribution of tariffs. This raises questions about the effectiveness of <b>custom</b> <b>duties</b> collection, and about its change with tariff liberalisation. Should tariff revenue losses associated with tariff changes be computed "at face value", i. e. based on statutory protection, or may the relationship be more complex? Would specific reforms be likely to improve <b>custom</b> <b>duty</b> collection? The double declaration of trade flows, by both the importer and the exporter, offers an opportunity to gauge the importance of these unlawful practices: while evading <b>custom</b> <b>duties</b> requires the importer to sidestep due registration upon importing, the same does not apply to the exporter. Using the discrepancy between mirror declarations at the product level to reveal <b>custom</b> <b>duties</b> evasion was pioneered by Baghwati (1964, 1967), whose results hinted about underinvoicing of imports in Turkey, in particular for manufactured products.
