50|$|The gap {{adjustment}} can {{be crucial to}} proper engine operation. A narrow gap may give too small and weak a spark to effectively ignite the fuel-air mixture, but the plug will almost always fire on each cycle. A gap that is too wide might prevent a spark from firing at all or may misfire at high speeds, but will usually have a spark that is strong for a <b>clean</b> <b>burn.</b> A spark which intermittently fails to ignite the fuel-air mixture may not be noticeable directly, but will show up as {{a reduction in the}} engine's power and fuel efficiency.|$|E
30|$|Some {{of their}} more notable {{findings}} was that floor patterns caused by ignitable liquids may be minimal because they can easily be destroyed, that the commonly reported <b>clean</b> <b>burn</b> damage {{may be caused by}} water spray from fire suppression hoselines and that areas of <b>clean</b> <b>burn</b> were associated with the inflow of air due to local ventilation flows. Mass loss of the furniture items was measured {{at the end of each}} test and was showed to relate well to the area of origin. Areas along the wall surfaces that were white in color directly adjacent to areas of significant soot deposition were found within this series of tests to be attributed to the oxidation of the soot from the surface (i.e. <b>clean</b> <b>burn)</b> and with wash from the hoseline for suppression. Also, the study illustrated that drywall seams, if no tape and mud was applied, would present areas of <b>clean</b> <b>burn</b> damage during ventilation-controlled conditions (Mealy et al. 2013).|$|E

30|$|Mealy et al. (2013) {{identified}} hose spray from suppression {{efforts as}} washing off areas of soot and ash from the gypsum wallboard, {{leaving behind a}} white area.

30|$|In 2005 and 2008, {{three studies}} were {{completed}} {{in conjunction with}} a training seminar to analyze burn pattern development in post-flashover fires (Carman 2008). This study focused on the impact of ventilation on fire patterns and the ability of fire investigators to use fire patterns to determine the quadrant of the room where the fire began. The test was conducted in a single compartment measuring 14  ft by 12  ft by 8  ft high (4.26  m[*]×[*] 3.66  m[*]×[*] 2.4  m) that resembled a residential bedroom with one open doorway to the exterior. The fire was allowed to burn in post-flashover conditions for approximately 2  min. <b>Clean</b> <b>burn</b> damage located on the wall opposite of the door opening (not at the area of origin) extended from the floor to the ceiling and had an approximate 6 -foot base. There was also an area of <b>clean</b> <b>burn</b> with angled lines of demarcation emanating from the area of origin.|$|E
30|$|Carman {{reports on}} three tests {{conducted}} at ATF’s fire research laboratory {{in a follow-up}} to his 2008 work (Carman 2010). The three tests were conducted with identical contents and ventilation. The compartment size, ventilation opening and setup were similar to the 2008 work. The three tests were better instrumented with three total heat flux gauges, one radiant heat flux gauge, three gas sensors (measuring O 2, CO 2, CO), and gas velocity probes (Oullette 2008). The tests were able to burn in the full-room involvement state for 7, 140 and 111  s respectively. Each test fire resulted in damage along the wall opposite of the door opening, progressively greater in magnitude with the longer duration in full-room involvement burning. This area of damage opposite the door had angled lines of demarcation that extended from the floor to the ceiling. A <b>clean</b> <b>burn</b> area of damage was located at the area of origin only with the fire with the shortest duration of full room involvement burning. <b>Clean</b> <b>burn</b> damage also occurred along the wall near the doorway opening in the fire with the longest full room involvement burning duration.|$|E

Two methods are used to visibly interpret damage on gypsum wallboard (1) cross-sections of the wall can be evaluated for visibly identifiable changes to the gypsum wallboard through depth and (2) the surface effects can be evaluated for visibly identifiable varying DOFD.|$|E
30|$|In 2009, Wolfe, Mealy and Gottuk {{conducted}} 15 full-scale {{tests with}} varying ventilation conditions and fuels. They focused on under-ventilated fires, the fire growth {{associated with these}} types of fires and their forensic analysis. While {{much of the research}} was based more on the tenability limits and associated dynamics in under-ventilated fires, they reported on a few forensic-based conclusions. These included that soot deposition can be used to aid in the area of origin determination and that the <b>clean</b> <b>burn</b> area size was proportional to the fire size (Wolfe et al. 2009).|$|E
30|$|Shanley et al. (1997) {{noted that}} the effect of {{ventilation}} was the one factor least understood and that ventilation-generated patterns were identified to be of great magnitude, sometimes greater than that of the patterns caused by the plume or origin.

30|$|Many of the {{firefighting}} factors {{would not}} necessarily develop new patterns that have unique characteristics. For example, the location of fire department entry, the use of positive pressure ventilation and the change of ventilation upon arrival should result in fire patterns {{that are similar to}} ventilation-generated fire patterns. The only point of contention then would be {{the manner in which the}} ventilation opening was created. Finally, an area that is white in color surrounded by soot areas should not be classified as a <b>clean</b> <b>burn</b> area until closer examination is performed.|$|E
30|$|Plume-generated fire {{patterns}} are {{commonly associated with}} a greater magnitude of damage (NFPA 2014). Therefore, the fire effect itself may {{provide a basis for}} determining what degree of heat flux and/or duration is required to cause the effect. For example, many materials must reach certain temperatures to melt, deform, or fail. If the temperatures are high enough to cause such damage, then it is likely that a plume caused the effect. For example, the <b>clean</b> <b>burn</b> effect requires wall temperatures to reach approximately 450 – 500  °C and should be evaluated as possibly exposed to a plume (Stratakis and Stamatelos 2003).|$|E
30|$|No {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} specifically to evaluate these patterns, however, some characteristics of these patterns have been identified in other fire pattern studies. Shanley et al. (1997)) reported that suppression-generated patterns, those caused by water spray from a fire department hose line, were easily identifiable in their test series. The water spray damage was composed of many elongated streaks, less than 1 -inch in length and were grouped and oriented so that they resembled a spray pattern. This study also noted that it was evident that the water did not wash all of the deposited material away from the wall or ceiling surface because “the patterns had a color which was lighter than the surrounding area but not as light as a <b>clean</b> <b>burn</b> or protected area” (Shanley et al. 1997).|$|E

30|$|This study {{noted that}} {{flashover}} and ventilation {{was one of}} the most misunderstood variables, having the influence to alter “normal” fire pattern production. Most notably, “patterns which indicated areas of intense burning but were remote from the point of origin were observed and were determined to be from ventilation effects only. This was observed in rooms, which had flashover conditions where <b>clean</b> <b>burn</b> areas were produced under windows away from the origin. This was also observed on walls opposite door openings” (Shanley et al. 1997). Heat and flame vector analysis was used as a process within these studies to document the direction of fire travel, location and magnitude of fire patterns, as well as a process of confirming the area of origin. Again, no procedural details were provided on how to implement the heat and flame vector analysis, but this was the first time that formalized diagrams and legends were published as demonstrative aids.|$|E

30|$|The {{origin and}} {{ignition}} {{of the three}} tests were in a pillow placed along the back corner of the couch on the floor against the wall with the window. Each fire {{was said to have}} only burned for 2  min in full room involvement. Thermocouple data and total heat flux gauges were used as instrumentation for all three burns. Test 1 had the window and door open for the entire duration of the fire, test 2 had the window hinged closed until flashover and then the window was left opened for the duration of post-flashover and test 3 had no window. These tests demonstrated similar findings as Carman’s tests (2008) that significant heat flux and <b>clean</b> <b>burn</b> occurs on the wall directly across the room from the doorway. There was no significant damage identified around the window ventilation, as the researchers discussed that this vent served primarily as an outflow for the heated gases, while the doorway served as the inflow due to the location of the neutral plane. The researchers also concluded that the fire pattern at the true origin persisted in all three tests.|$|E
30|$|Carman (2008) noted similar {{areas of}} damage of great {{magnitude}} directly opposite door openings {{and within the}} inflow of the air from this door. Several studies noted areas of <b>clean</b> <b>burn</b> and damage of great magnitude occurring around contents and to wall surfaces within this airflow and to wall surfaces directly opposite of the opening during ventilation-controlled conditions (Custer and Wright 1984; Shanley et al. 1997; Carman 2008; Gorbett et al. (2010)). Although, Shanley et al. (1997)) and Gorbett et al. (2010) do not find this similar effect when performing studies in compartments where the ventilation openings are connected to adjacent compartments, not directly to the exterior. Shanley et al. (1997)) reports that a damaged area of great magnitude was identified in the tests done in NIST’s Large Fire Research Facility where the ventilation opening to {{the exterior of the}} compartment had access to an abundant amount of ‘fresh’ air. However, this area of damage was not identified in comparison studies performed in acquired structures where the opening was connected to an adjacent compartment within the house. Shanley et al. (1997)) contends that the source of available ‘fresh’ air from adjacent spaces will have a significant influence on whether or not the ventilation-generated patterns are prevalent with such magnitude.|$|E

Gasification is the process in which gas released from the primary combustion of biomass is reignited, creating a more complete combustion and thus reducing harmful emissions compared to a traditional wood fire. From testing with a previous design team’s prototype, observations were made which led to the implementation of an air flow system which could be regulated manually. The air flow regulator is a mechanical attachment that allows users to adjust the air flow in the stove to prolong the gasification process; this modification helps the stove maintain gasification throughout usage, and resulted in an 8 % reduction of particulate matter in the stove’s exhaust compared to the most recent design...|$|E

5000|$|Coal {{gasification}} is {{a process}} whereby a hydrocarbon feedstock (coal) is converted into gaseous components by applying heat under pressure {{in the presence of}} steam. Rather than burning, most of the carbon-containing feedstock is broken apart by chemical reactions that produce [...] "syngas." [...] Syngas is primarily hydrogen and carbon monoxide, but the exact composition can vary. In Integrated Gasification Combined-Cycle (IGCC) systems, the syngas is <b>cleaned</b> and <b>burned</b> as fuel in a combustion turbine which then drives an electric generator. Exhaust heat from the combustion turbine is recovered and used to create steam for a steam turbine-generator. The use of these two types of turbines in combination is one reason why gasification-based power systems can achieve high power generation efficiencies. Currently, commercially available gasification-based systems can operate at around 40% efficiencies. Syngas, however, emits more greenhouse gases than natural gas, and almost twice as much carbon as a coal plant. Coal gasification is also water-intensive.|$|R
