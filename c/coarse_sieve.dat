50|$|Fitzgerald {{argued against}} {{the model of}} tooth-aided filter feeding, based {{on the lack of}} closely pressed teeth and the {{presence}} of simple postcanine crowns. Deméré argues that this assumes a very small prey size (i.e., krill). The distinction here is that Aetiocetus was a bulk feeder, and prey size does not enter into this definition of feeding strategy. There is no reason to assume a priori that all bulk filter-feeders eat small prey, given the large diversity of food items consumed by modern mysticetes. Demere hypothesizes that Aetiocetus’ bulk feeding behavior could have targeted large prey, such as schooling fish or squid. With prey items of this size, Aetiocetus’ teeth would still have served well as a <b>coarse</b> <b>sieve.</b>|$|E

Discovery of {{new high}} {{temperature}} alloys is a multidimensional problem which encompasses the intrinsic thermodynamic stability and their thermo-chemical and thermo-mechanical {{response to the}} combustion environment. Even when considering only the transition metals in combination with stable oxide formers, the number of ternary combinations exceeds 104.

Sieves retained all organisms with a body length > 10 x the mesh size. Logistic regression models were estimated to describe retention probabilities as functions of body length and mesh size. Retention probability functions differed slightly but significantly among sites, operators, and taxa. Retention probabilities were higher for samples containing filamentous algae, which entangled invertebrates. Size distributions of straight, elongate invertebrates (e. g., oligochaetes, midge larvae) retained by sieves were more variable than distributions of more spherical organisms (e. g., gastropods). On average, the 1 -mm sieve retained > 90 % of invertebrate biomass but < 33 % of individuals retained by a 63 -μm sieve. Size distribution of organisms retained by <b>coarse</b> <b>sieves</b> (≥ 1 mm), combined with logistic functions predicting retention probability, {{can be used to}} describe abundance, biomass, and size distribution of organisms retained by fine sieves.

Processing time for whole samples (5 - and 10 -mm fraction) averaged 91 ± 25 min compared with 55 ± 16 min for the 10 -mm mesh fraction. Altogether 40 % of free-living species and 9 % of attached species were recorded exclusively in the 5 -mm fraction. The majority of these species were rare.

40|$|At Museum of Archaeology, Stavanger, a new {{flotation}} {{machine has}} been constructed. The AMS-machine (Advanced Macrofossil Separation) {{is able to}} treat wet as well as dry soil samples and the machine is specially developed for the soil conditions in regions with a humid climate. In one single process of less than 15 minutes both macrofossils and small archaeological finds are gently separated from soil samples of about 4 litres. The {{main part of the}} AMSmachine is an inclined, water-filled and slowly rotating tube, length about 2 metres, with continuous water supply in the lower and closed part. When a soil sample is put in the ample tube, the water-flow first conducts floating organic material into a sieve below the higher and open end of the tube. In the next step, with the tube less inclined, wet and heavy organic material follows. Finally, with the tube in level, cleaned material like gravel and eventually small fragments of archaeological objects like shells, bones, flint, pottery and metal is gradually deposited into a <b>coarser</b> <b>sieve,</b> which allows sand and gravel to pass through. As the machine does not need constant attention, the operator is free to do other work meanwhile, or eventually operate two machines at the same time. After processing a soil sample, the tube is automatically cleaned by water, thus eliminating the risk of contaminating one sample with traces of the previous. During testing at the excavation sites in Rogaland, the capacity has been about 60 litres a day, and many interesting finds of charred cereals, weed seeds, coprolites, pottery-fragments, etc. have been detected. As the machine runs on electricity and uses pure water, the method is not harmful to the environment and does not affect material for 14 C analysis.

40|$|The {{choice of}} the {{sediment}} size fraction {{in the analysis of}} fossil planktonic foraminifera is of great importance in determining the composition of assemblages. In past studies several size fractions have been utilised. Imbrie and Kipp (1971) stated that “smaller fractions give rise to too many uncertainties in the identification of small specimens and require too long to process. Large mesh size yield undesiderable loss of small species, and small specimens of larger species”. The adoption of <b>coarser</b> <b>sieve</b> meshes has the effect to reduce the percentages of small sized (usually living in cold waters) species (Bé and Hutson, 1977). In a comparison between > 63 μm and > 150 μm size-fraction of planktonic foraminifera assemblages from NW Atlantic Ocean, Smart (2002), stated that because particular smaller species are either under-represented or even absent from the larger (> 150 μm) size-fraction, the smaller (> 63 μm) size-fraction must be included in studies of planktonic foraminifera. Di Donato et al. (2008) highlighted in the > 150 μm size fraction of a core from the Tyrrhenian Sea, a great loss of the small-sized species Turborotalita quinqueloba in glacial samples, where this species is very abundant. This caused an increase in warm water species such as Globigerinoides ruber, apparently reaching typical Holocene values in some full glacial levels. From the above mentioned statements, it is clear that treatment changes can strongly influence the results of palaeoclimatic reconstructions based on planktonic foraminiferal assemblages. As stated by Aitchison (1986, 1992) scale invariance and subcompositional coherence are fundamental properties of the compositional data analysis (CODA). The main goal {{of this paper is to}} verify if the variable relationships pointing out from CODA of foraminiferal assemblages are or not influenced by the size fraction and, more in general, to test the robustness of CODA respect to treatment changes related to different preparation techniques for the analysis of planktonic foraminifer...|$|R
40|$|Mt. Vesuvius, Italy, is {{regarded}} as one of the world's most dangerous volcanoes because of the potential for vast numbers of people to be affected by the renewal of volcanic activity; more than 600 000 people live within 10 km of the summit alone. Vesuvius has been quiescent since 1944 and with continued dormancy, the more likely it is that the next eruption will be explosive. At that point, wide-spread concern is likely over the potential health hazard of the ash, away from the zone of primary volcanic hazards. Analyses of the mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of ash provide us with critical information on the potential toxicity of the particles, for example, whether particles are sufficiently small to enter the lungs and whether the particles have reactive properties which could trigger disease. Rapid assessment of these characteristics allows real-time decision making on hazard mitigation issues (e. g. distribution of dust masks) and allows considered judgement on whether to embark on major medical/toxicological studies. The study presented here is the first time that the potential respiratory health hazard of ash from Vesuvius volcano has been considered and allows planning for future eruption scenarios. Twenty-one ash samples, representing the range of eruption styles at Vesuvius, were collected and analysed. The results demonstrate that the physical processes of fragmentation play an important role in determining the grain size and, therefore, hazard, of the ash. Here, the finest samples derive from the interaction of magma and water during the final, phreatomagmatic phases of plinian and subplinian eruptions (16 vol. % < 4 µm material), while the low-intensity explosivity activity, associated with lava effusion, produces coarse ash posing a lesser hazard. The quantity of material found in the different health-pertinent fractions is strongly correlated, allowing prediction of these fractions where only <b>coarser</b> <b>sieve</b> data are available. Since Vesuvius produces silica under-saturated products, ‘free’ crystalline silica in the ash does not pose a significant health hazard (< 2 wt. % cristobalite and < 3 wt. % quartz). Surface tests showed that the capability of the ash to generate the highly-reactive hydroxyl free radical varies considerably amongst samples, with available surface iron correlating well with reactivity potential...|$|R

40|$|We have {{initiated}} {{a major new}} program to determine the grain size distribution of nearly all lunar soils collected in the Apollo program. Following the return of Apollo soil and core samples, a number of investigators including our own group performed grain size distribution studies and published the results [1 - 11]. Nearly all of these studies were done by sieving the samples, usually with a working fluid such as Freon(TradeMark) or water. We have measured the particle size distribution of lunar soil 10084, 2005 in water, using a Microtrac(TradeMark) laser diffraction instrument. Details of our own sieving technique and protocol (also used in [11]). are given in [4]. While sieving usually produces accurate and reproducible results, it has disadvantages. It is very labor intensive and requires hours to days to perform properly. Even using automated sieve shaking devices, {{four or five days}} may be needed to sieve each sample, although multiple sieve stacks increases productivity. Second, sieving is subject to loss of grains through handling and weighing operations, and these losses are concentrated in the finest grain sizes. Loss from handling becomes a more acute problem when smaller amounts of material are used. While we were able to quantitatively sieve into 6 or 8 size fractions using starting soil masses as low as 50 mg, attrition and handling problems limit the practicality of sieving smaller amounts. Third, sieving below 10 or 20 microns is not practical because of the problems of grain loss, and smaller grains sticking to <b>coarser</b> grains. <b>Sieving</b> is completely impractical below about 5 - 10 microns. Consequently, sieving gives no information on the size distribution below approx. 10 microns which includes the important submicrometer and nanoparticle size ranges. Finally, sieving creates a limited number of size bins and may therefore miss fine structure of the distribution which would be revealed by other methods that produce many smaller size bins...|$|R

Therefore, the data presented in the accompanying charts and tables {{should not be considered}} as derived from a random sampling program. It is also highly probable that some of the sand units sampled had been subjected to washing during core-barrel retrieval. The data presented for these sand units should be interpreted carefully. Core sections that were highly deformed were sampled only if a distinct coarse-grained lithology was present. The shore laboratory method of grain-size analysis followed standard methods as outlined in the DSDP project manual. In general, the methods consisted of sediment dispersal in a Calgon solution, or other suitable dispersant, using an ultrasonic bath. Sand and any <b>coarser</b> fractions were <b>sieved,</b> while the silt and clay fractions were analyzed by pipette methods.

40|$|Abstract Starch in grains {{represents}} {{the main source}} of dietary energy for monogastric production animals. However, utilization of this energy is not complete due to factors related to grain source and in vivo gastrointestinal conditions. Incomplete starch digestion is a significant economic issue for the pork industry in Australia and prior evidence suggests that there is room for improvement. The general hypothesis of this thesis is that milled grain particle size fractions obtained by sieving posses a significantly different and wide range of functional and compositional properties in relation to digestion and hydrothermal processing. To identify these properties, sorghum and barley grains were milled separately using a 4 mm hammer-mill and then the ground cereals were segregated by size using a series of analytical sieves. Generated different particle sizes were investigated for their properties before and after cooking using extrusion processing. Sorghum was used {{as an example of a}} high starch content grain with low fibre content and barley was used as an example of a grain which contains high levels of fibre. Both grains are widely used as major feed ingredients in Australia, particularly in Queensland. Particle Size Effect on Digestibility The effect of milled uncooked grain particle size on the kinetics of enzymatic starch digestion and starch sources was examined. The in vitro starch digestion for different particle sizes were well fitted by simple first order kinetics for both barley (r 2 range 0. 90 - 0. 99) and sorghum (r 2 range 0. 87 - 0. 99). The digestion rate coefficients for different particle sizes decreased with increasing particle size, and were shown to be well fitted by an inverse square relationship for both barley (r 2 = 0. 99) and sorghum (r 2 = 0. 98). This supports the hypothesis that the rate-determining step in starch digestion is the diffusion of enzyme through the grain fragment. Quantitatively, the estimated (apparent) diffusion coefficient was estimated for both barley and sorghum (1. 7 and 0. 76 x 10 - 7 cm 2 s- 1, respectively). The apparent diffusion coefficient of á- amylase enzyme in grains was lower by an order of magnitude than that obtained in water, thus quantifying the barriers to amylase diffusion caused by grain structure. Particle Size Distribution in Milled Grain The contribution of individual size fractions to the overall hydration, rheological, and enzyme susceptibility properties of milled grain was evaluated. Sieve fractions were obtained from hammer-milled barley and sorghum grains (eight sieves, 0. 125 mm to 2. 8 mm opening size). Different particle size fractions showed a significant effect on digestion and hydrothermal properties. The extent of starch digestibility varied between different particle size up to 10 fold between the smallest and the largest particle size. When the results obtained for the unfractionated milled grain were compared to the weight average values (calculated from fraction yields and property values for each size fraction), water absorption index (WAI), water solubility index (WSI), and starch digestibility values were not significantly different from values obtained for non-fractionated ground grains of both barley and sorghum. Generally, hydration and digestibility results can be attributed to particle size and composition (starch or soluble fibre) of individual fractions. Response to hydrothermal treatment was different between sorghum and barley. In sorghum, viscosity profiles for the fractions were controlled by starch swelling which became increasingly limited as particle sizes increased. However in barley, viscosity profiles for segregated fractions did not show typical starch-based behaviour and were most likely controlled by the soluble fibre component. The results show the possibility of predicting and manipulating hydration and digestibility properties of ground grains simply by indentifying the particle size distribution of ground grains. Extrusion Processing of Milled Grain Extrusion processing was used in attempts to increase the rate and extent of starch digestibility as well as to characterize processing parameters and extrudate properties. Extrusion processing of three levels of particle size after sieve fractionation (fine, medium and coarse fractions) affected processing parameters (torque, specific mechanical energy [SME], die pressure), extrudate properties (WAI, WSI, expansion index, pasting profiles, and the kinetics and extent of starch digestion). The differences in response to processing parameters and extrudate properties was mainly due to the differences in viscosity during extrusion, while extrusion temperature (100 °C versus 140 °C maximum barrel temperature) had a smaller effect. The different particle size fractions of sorghum and barley both before and after extrusion showed a good fit to first-order kinetics of starch digestion, with all r 2 values above 0. 95. Results of the extrusion experiment suggested that the extent of swelling and gelatinisation during the extrusion may have been further improved by incorporating a pre-conditioning stage prior to extrusion. Particle size had a significant effect on the fractional digestion rate for both grains, but extrusion temperature had no effect. Based on fractional digestion rate values, extrusion processing at low temperature (100 °C) could be an alternative method to fine milling for achieving a high rate and extent of starch digestion. Feed Conversion in Pigs A novel processing procedure, based on separating the coarse fraction after hammer milling and then regrinding this fraction, was used in an attempt to improve growth performance in pigs offered barley and sorghum based diets. The pig feeding trial examined the effect of (a) grain type (barley; sorghum), (b) particle size (ground grain; ground grain where the coarse fraction was separated and re-ground then added back to the fine fraction), and (c) diet form (mash, pellet), on feed conversion ratio (FCR), rate of growth (ROG) and average daily intake (ADI). Particle size had the largest effect on FCR in pigs. Feeding pigs a barley or sorghum based diet in the mash form after regrinding the coarse fraction improved FCR in sorghum by 10 % and in barley by 7. 8 % compared to diets prepared without regrinding the coarse fraction. The form of the diet showed a smaller effect on FCR. In the pellet form, pigs fed sorghum or barley based diets after regrinding the coarse fraction improved FCR in sorghum by 5. 1 % and in barley by 4. 8 % compared to diets prepared without regrinding the coarse fraction. Within grain type, effects of particle size or diet form on ROG and ADI in barley were not statistically significant, although their ratio (FCR) did show significance. In sorghum, pigs offered diets in the ground-mash form had the highest ADI. Pigs offered ground-mash form (ground grain where the coarse fraction was separated and re-ground then added back to the fine fraction) had the highest ROG. The results from this investigation suggest that regrinding the <b>coarse</b> fraction after <b>sieve</b> separation can be used to maximise feed conversion ratio (FCR) for both barley and sorghum based diets. In contrast to single stage grinding through a smaller screen size, the regrinding method used in this work did not result in major increases in fractions with sizes below 0. 5 mm and particularly below 0. 25 mm. This is important as these very small particles cause dust problems in handling and on ingestion. Desired hydration properties, chemical composition, response to hydrothermal treatment, and extent of starch digestion could be manipulated by modifying the distribution of particular size fractions of ground grains. Extrusion of medium and coarse size fractions can enhance digestibility with efficient utilization of thermal energy compared to extrusion of ground but unfractionated grains. This could be a good processing strategy as this work has found that the rate and extent of starch digestion is relatively high for uncooked small particle size fractions. Alternatively, regrinding the coarse fraction after separation could be an alternative method to conventional steam pelletizing for increasing starch digestibility and energy delivery to growing pigs...|$|R
