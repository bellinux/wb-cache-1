The reaction yields the carboxylic acid, not the nitrile, but Rosenmund speculated that the intermediate should be the nitrile.

50|$|The {{synthesis}} (in this case, of carbon-14-labelled material) {{can be seen}} {{in figure}} 1. In the first step, o-nitroaniline (compound 1) is purified through dissolution in hot water-ethanol mixture in relation 2:1. carbon is added and the result is filtrated for clarifying. The filtrate is chilled while kept in movement to generate crystals, usually at 4 °C, but if needed it can also be cooled to -10 °C. The crystals are then collected, washed and dried. If it is pure enough it is used for the following steps, which take place at 0 till 5 °C. To produce o-Nitrobenzonitrile-14C (compound 2), the first component o-nitroaniline and (concentrated reagent grade) hydrochloric acid are put together with ice and water. Sodium nitride, dissolved in water, is added to this thin slurry. After the formation of a pale-yellow solution, which indicates the completion of the diazotization reaction, the pH should be adjusted to 6. After this, the solution is introduced to a mixture of <b>cuprous</b> <b>cyanide</b> and toluene. At room temperature the toluene layer is removed. The aqueous layer is washed and dried and the purified product is isolated by crystallization. The third product is Anthranilamide-14C (compound 3). It is formed out of o-Nitrobenzonitrile-14C, which is first solved in ethanol and hydrazine hydrate. The solvent is heated subsequently, treated in a well-ventilated hood with small periodic charges, smaller than 10 mg, of Raney nickel. Under nitrogen atmosphere the ethanolic solution is clarified and dried. The next step is to form 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4(3H)-one-14C (compound 4). In water dissolved sodium nitrite is added to anthranilamide and hydrochloric acid in ice water. Because this is a diazotization reaction, the product is pale-yellow again. After this the pH is adjusted to 8,5. This causes the ring closure to form 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4(3H)-one-14C. This results in a sodium salt slurry that can be treated with hydrochloric acid, what lowers the pH down to 2 till 4. The 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4(3H)-one-14C is collected, washed and dried. In the following step 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4-(3-chloromethyl)-one-14C has to be formed. Therefore, 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4(3H)-one-14C and paraformaldehyde are added to ethylene dichloride and heated to 40 °C. Then thionyl chloride is added and the whole solvent is further heated to 65 °C. After four hours of heating the solution is cooled down to room temperature. Water is added and the solution is neutralized. The ethylene dichloride layer is removed and put together with the result of the washed aqueous layer. The solvent was filtered and dried. The last step is the actual synthesis of Azinphos methyl. Ethylene dichloride is added to the compound resulting from the fifth step, 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4-(3-chloromethyl)-one-14C. This mixture is heated to 50 °C and sodium bicarbonate and O,O-dimethyl phosphorodithioate sodium salt in water are added. The ethylene dichloride layer is removed, reextracted with ethylene dichloride and purified by filtration. The pure filtrate is dried. This product is once again purified by recrystallization from methanol. What is left is pure azinphos-methyl in form of white crystals.|$|E

40|$|Batch {{flotation}} {{tests of}} a lead–zinc sulphide composite ore from the Rosh Pinah Mine {{have been carried}} out at pH 8. 5 in the presence of copper cyanide complexes.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to improve the {{flotation}} selectivity between galena and sphalerite during the flotation of a Cu-Pb-Zn sulphide composite ore from the Rosh Pinah Mine (Namibia). Xanthate collectors {{were found to be}} unselective for the flotation of the Rosh Pinah composite sample. It was observed that the recovery of sphalerite increased with both the recovery of galena and the concentrate mass pull. In addition, the recovery of sphalerite increased after activation with Cu(II) ions while that of galena decreased when the composite was dry ground in a mild steel mill with mild steel grinding media. However, the recovery of galena was not affected after wet milling in a stainless steel mill. The recovery of Cu(II) -activated sphalerite was independent of the milling environment (wet or dry) and grinding media. The activation of sphalerite by <b>cuprous</b> <b>cyanide</b> complexes, which are present in the recycled water, was clearly shown in this study. Both batch flotation tests and XPS analysis have confirmed that sphalerite was activated by copper(I) from the <b>cuprous</b> <b>cyanide</b> complexes. The recovery of copper(I) -activated sphalerite increased further when the composite was dry milled as compared to wet milling. Batch flotation tests have shown that the use of cyanide alone is not efficient for the depression of sphalerite due to the mineralogical texture of the Rosh Pinah ore. A large quantity of galena locked and/or attached to sphalerite was observed in the lead concentrate. Their prevalence increased with increasing particle size. The use of both cyanide and zinc sulphate improved the depression of sphalerite much better than cyanide alone. A flowsheet has been proposed to improve selectivity between galena and sphalerite in the lead flotation circuit. It includes the regrinding of the lead rougher concentrate prior to the cleaning stage due to poor liberation between galena and sphalerite.

40|$|Cyanide {{and copper}} often co-exist in process water with {{complicated}} speciation. The deposition of copper on pyrite from cyanide bearing solutions is unknown {{and is the}} objective of this study. The electrochemical behaviour of pyrite in a solution with CN/Cu mole ratio of 3 / 1 has been investigated in different solution pH values. It was found that, at pH 7, <b>cuprous</b> <b>cyanide</b> can be oxidized to Cu(ii) oxide/hydroxide which deposit on the pyrite surface and transform to Cu(i) -sulfide during the subsequent cathodic sweeping. However, this anodic deposition process is inhibited either at pH 10 due to the dissolution of solid Cu(ii) /Cu(i) -species by Cu(CN), or at pH 5 due to the high solubility of Cu(ii) oxide/hydroxide. On the other hand, Cu(CN) can be deposited onto pyrite, forming a Cu(i) -sulfide layer at more reducing potentials.

In the present study, {{the destruction of}} Cu(CN) (3) (2 -) with H 2 O 2 in water under alkaline conditions was investigated. H 2 O 2 oxidized the cyanide from Cu(CN) (3) (2 -) to cyanate {{with the formation of}} Cu(CN) (2) - firstly. Following, the continuous oxidation of cyanide from Cu(CN) (2) - and the attendant dissociation of Cu(CN) (2) - led to progressive liberation of Cu+. Transformation of Cu+ to Cu 2 + was confirmed afterward by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Meantime, the center dot OH signal was detected by electron spin resonance assay. It was concluded that Fenton-like reaction occurred between the liberated Cu+ and H 2 O 2. UV-vis spectra studies revealed the formation of superoxo-cupric complex between Cu 2 + and H 2 O 2 in alkaline conditions, which decomposed into Cu 2 + species and O- 2 finally. Thus, how to improve the utilization of H 2 O 2 and enhance the destruction of Cu(CN) (3) (2 -) should be considered in the treatment of Cu(CN) (3) (2 -) wastewater. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|A novel gas rnembrane-ion {{exchange}} process (GM-IX) {{is described}} to treat metal plating wastewaters containing zinc cyanide and recover usable forms of zinc and cyanide. The process uses a strongly basic {{anion exchange resin}} to selectively concentrate the metal cyanides from dilute plating wastes. Following exhaustion, the resin is regenerated under acidic conditions. The metal cyanide complexes are broken down {{as a result of}} HCN production under these acidic conditions, and the acidic regenerant containing the HCN is recirculated through a gas rnenbrane module that is supplied with a caustic stripping solution. Volatile HCN migrates across the gas perneable membranes to be absorbed and neutralized in the NaOH solution. The products of the process include concentrated sodium cyanide solution containing some excess sodium hydroxide, and concentrated acidic zinc sulfate solution that can be treated by an electrowinning process to recover zinc metal and a reusable acid for regeneration. Results of mass transfer studies indicate that the rate of HCN transfer across the gas permeable membrane is rapid and complete. The transfer is largely limited by diffusion within the lumen of the hollow fibers but also is influenced by the reaction rate of HCN with base outside the fibers. The gas permeable membrane provides the basis for effective separation and recovery of cyanide from zinc and cadmium plating wastes. Initial ion exchange is necessary to concentrate dilute metal cyanide solutions such as rinsewaters, but if the wastewater is already concentrated, only acidification is required. Th e zinc cyanide precipitate formed in the resin during regeneration was found to be Zn(CN) 2 (s), Recovery of cyanide from acidified zinc and cadmium cyanide solution is fast and complete when the solution pH is sufficiently acidic to convert the cyanide to the HCN form; above pH 2. 0 the rate of cyanide recovery was slowed by the 1 ow percentage of HCN present at equilibrium. In concentrated zinc cyanide solutions such as may be encountered during regeneration a lower pH is required to convert all the complexed cyanide to HCN. To achieve good regeneration, a strong acid solution and sufficient contact time must be provided to ensure complete cyanide removal. A kinetic model interfaced with a chemical equilibrium model successfully predicted the rate of cyanide recovery as a function of operating pH. Agreement between the predicted and the observed cyanide recovery rates indicated that the dissolution rates of Zn(CN) 2 (s), does not appear to limit the cyanide recovery rate. Rather, the rate is controlled by the cyanide speciation equilibria. Solutions containing copper and silver cyanides are Iess readily treated. The use of organic acids to catalyze the breakdown of these metal cyanides may aid these less tractable solutions. Cyanide cannot be completely recovered simply by acidification of concentrated copper cyanide solutions because of the formation of a <b>cuprous</b> <b>cyanide</b> precipitate. With addition of FeC 13,, <b>cuprous</b> <b>cyanide</b> precipitate can be oxidized and cyanide can be completely recovered in the NaCN form. Water Resources Research Cente...|$|E
40|$|Synthesis and {{characterization}} of the three known members of the homologous series Y 1 Ba 2 Cu 6 +n O 6 +n (n= 1, 2, 3) of high temperature superconductors using a novel route forms the main theme of our study. Use of the low melting point <b>cuprous</b> <b>cyanide</b> [Cu 2 (CN 2) ] as the starting copper compound is the key element of our preparation route. The liquid-solid reaction during the firing stage and the presumed high chemical activity of Cu+ 1 state of copper in [Cu 2 (CN 2) ] is expected to lead to efficient and more complete chemical reaction during calcination {{as compared to the}} all-oxide based synthesis. This, in turn, would produce more homogeneous material, relatively free from un reacted impurity phases. Characterization studies based on electrical resistivity, a. c. magnetic susceptibility, x-ray diffraction and infrared absorption on both [Cu 2 (CN 2) ] and CuO-based 123 superconductors confirm the above expectations. A detailed investigation of the effects of various preparation conditions has been carried out for our cyanide-based route and the optimal parameters of synthesis established. Alumina boat for calcination is found to adversely affect the superconducting quality of our material while quartz boat leads to the best results. X-ray diffraction and IR absorption analysis results point to the incorporation of Al from the alumina boat as the probable cause of deleterious effects of the alumina boat. Variation of the ambient used during preparation from the completely oxidising atmosphere to fully reducing atmosphere leads to very interesting insights into the probable reasons for a strong variation in the superconducting to semi conducting characteristics of the material. Detailed analysis of the temperature dependence of the normal-state resistivity of the semiconducting phase material leads to the following picture. Shallow acceptor states in the band gap are introduced by defects associated with oxygen deficiency in the 123 crystal. Thermal activation of free carriers (holes) from these states leads to an increase in the electrical conductivity with temperature. With the increase in the oxygen content from x= 0. 13 to 0. 71, a decrease in activation energy of these states from 15 meV to 3. 3 meV is observed which is reflected in the increase {{in the value of the}} normal state conductivity with increase in the oxygen content. Thus the well known increase in the hole density with oxygen content seems to be the result of a decreasing activation energy of oxygen related shallow acceptors, according to our observations. Following the same Cu 2 (CN) 2 route we have succeeded in synthesizing the other two homologues YBa 2 Cu 4 O 8 and Y 2 Ba 4 Cu 7 O 15 -x, The important point of our preparation of these superconductors is that we could achieve good quality materials without the use of high oxygen pressures. In our preparation procedure oxygen at normal atmospheric pressure is used. This is a great advantage of our route over the hitherto reported high pressure routes. Again the effects of the variation of the various preparation parameters are thoroughly investigated for these materials. We believe Cu 2 (CN) 2 holds the key to this success - in addition to making the chemical reactions during calcination more efficient, it seems to act as a getterer of oxygen for all three superconductors prepared by us. To investigate the role of Cu 2 (CN) 2 in greater detail a separate study on the decomposition behaviour of Cu 2 (CN) 2 has been carried out in our work. Thermal analysis data are combined with infrared absorption measurements to obtain insight into the nature of the products at various stages of this decomposition. These studies led to the conclusion that <b>cuprous</b> <b>cyanide,</b> before its decomposition, is converted into a cyclized product. This cyclized product is very reactive and it reacts with other constituents very rapidly with the formation of Cu 2 O, CuO and liberation of cyanogen gas in the atmosphere of air.
