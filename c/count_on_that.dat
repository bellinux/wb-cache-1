Do I look as if I were happy, and were stirring you up with a stick for my amusement? Here we all {{are in the same}} boat; we might as well understand each other! These women must know that I 'm not to be <b>counted</b> <b>on.</b> <b>That</b> sounds remarkably cool, no doubt, and I certainly don't deny your right to be utterly disgusted with me." ...|$|R

So far, I've been found where I was wanted--and that as our friend suggests was generally where there was trouble--but I never took five cents for reward or fee." ...|$|E

"You {{know what}} to do, girls," [...] said Hans; [...] "do it, and in three days you should be safe in England, where, perhaps, I may meet you, though do not <b>count</b> <b>on</b> <b>that.</b> Whatever happens, keep honest, and {{remember}} me till we come together again, here or hereafter, but, most of all, remember your mother and your benefactor Hendrik Brant.

"When {{they told}} me at first that I had a serious injury {{and there was only}} a small chance of {{participating}} (in Brazil), I didn’t care whether it was 10, 20 or 50 percent; I was <b>counting</b> <b>on</b> <b>THAT</b> chance.

Now, there are two of Grier's troopers camping in a bluff a league back to watch the trail, and if I could only bring them up before the rustlers go, {{we ought to get}} one or two of them.

The British officials might doubt his story and decline to interfere, but Kenwardine could not <b>count</b> <b>on</b> <b>that,</b> because Don Sebastian was armed with credentials from the President of a friendly state.|$|E

"I don't {{want them}} as you'll meet at {{headquarters}} to think you're a dummy, Amateur, and it's {{in my mind}} {{to give you a}} little outline, so to speak, of this 'ere school, after which there'll be no need of your showing ignorance by asking questions.

6000|$|Soubise {{leads the}} French this final Year; {{but he has}} a D'Estrees with him (our old D'Estrees of HASTENBECK), who much helps the account current; and though {{generally}} on the declining hand (obliged to give up Gottingen, to edge away farther and farther out of Hessen itself, to give up the Weser, and see no shift but the farther side of Fulda, with Frankfurt to rear),--is not often caught napping as here at Wilhelmsthal. There ensued about the banks of the Fulda, and the question, Shall we be driven across it sooner or not so soon? a great deal of fighting and pushing (Battle called of LUTTERNBERG, Battle of JOHANNISBERG, and others): but all readers will look forward rather to the CANNONADE OF AMONEBURG, more precisely Cannonade of the BRUCKEN-MUHLE (September 2lst), which finishes these wearisome death-wrestlings.

Montalvo {{is a good}} sort of fellow in his own fashion, but he is an extravagant man and a desperate gambler, with a queer history, I fancy--at least, nobody knows much about him, not even his brother officers. If you ask them they shrug their {{shoulders}} and say that Spain is a big kettle full {{of all sorts of}} fish. One thing I do know, however, that he is over head and ears in debt; indeed, there was trouble about it down at The Hague. So, cousin, don't you play with him more than you can help, and don't reckon on that thousand florins to pay your bills with. It is a mystery to me how the man gets on, but I am told that a foolish old vrouw in Amsterdam lent him a lot till she discovered--but there, I don't talk scandal. And now," [...] he added, changing his voice, [...] "is this place private?" ...|$|E

[...] It seems to me very much as if I were gingerly embarking on a HISTORY OF MODERN SCOTLAND. Probably Tulloch will never carry it out. And, you see, once I have studied and written these two vols., THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS and SCOTLAND AND THE UNION, I shall have a good ground to go upon. The effect on my mind of what I have read has been to awaken a livelier sympathy for the Irish; although they never had the remarkable virtues, I fear they have suffered many of the injustices, of the Scottish Highlanders. Ruedi has seen me this morning; he says the disease is at a standstill, and I am to profit by it to take more exercise.

6000|$|He nodded, {{and when}} she had gone lowered himself into his chair {{with a sense of}} appeasement. Pretty girl! Comfort to see a pretty face--not a pale, peeky thing like Adela's. His anger burned up anew. So she counted on his helplessness, had begun to <b>count</b> <b>on</b> <b>that,</b> had she? She should see that there was life in the old dog yet! And his {{sacrifice}} of the uneaten souffle, the still less eaten mushrooms, the peppermint sweet with which he usually concluded dinner, seemed to consecrate that purpose. They all thought he was a hulk, without a shot left in the locker! He had seen a couple of them at the Board that afternoon shrugging at each other, as though saying: 'Look at him!' And young Farney pitying him. Pity, forsooth! And that coarse-grained solicitor chap at the creditors' meeting curling his lip as much as to say: 'One foot in the grave!' He had seen the clerks dowsing the glim of their grins; and that young pup Bob Pillin screwing up his supercilious mug over his dog-collar. He knew that scented humbug Rosamund was getting scared that he'd drop off before she'd squeezed him dry. And his valet was always looking him up and down queerly. As to that holy woman--! Not quite so fast! Not quite so fast! And filling his glass for the fourth time, he slowly sucked down the dark red fluid, with the [...] "old boots" [...] flavour which his soul loved, and, drawing deep at his cigar, closed his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe I can. You {{have noticed}} that our chief knight says a good many wise things and has a {{thoughtful}} head on his shoulders. One day, riding along, {{we were talking about}} Joan's great talents, and he said, 'But, greatest of all her gifts, she has the seeing eye.' I said, like an unthinking fool, 'The seeing eye?I shouldn't <b>count</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> for muchI suppose we all have it.' 'No,' he said; 'very few have it.' Then he explained, and made his meaning clear. He said the common eye sees only the outside of things, and judges by that, but the seeing eye pierces through and reads the heart and the soul, finding there capacities which the outside didn't indicate or promise, and which the other kind of eye couldn't detect. He said the mightiest military genius must fail and come to nothing if it have not the seeing eyethat is to say, if it cannot read men and select its subordinates with an infallible judgment. It sees as by intuition that this man is good for strategy, that one for dash and daredevil assault, the other for patient bulldog persistence, and it appoints each to his right place and wins, while the commander without the seeing eye would give to each the other's place and lose. He was right about Joan, and I saw it. When she was a child and the tramp came one night, her father and all of us took him for a rascal, but she saw the honest man through the rags. When I dined with the governor of Vaucouleurs so long ago, I saw nothing in our two knights, though I sat with them and talked with them two hours; Joan was there five minutes, and neither spoke with them nor heard them speak, yet she marked them for men of worth and fidelity, and they have confirmed her judgment. Whom has she sent for to take charge of this thundering rabble of new recruits at Blois, made up of old disbanded Armagnac raiders, unspeakable hellions, every one? Why, she has sent for Satan himselfthat is to say, La Hirethat military hurricane, that godless swashbuckler, that lurid conflagration of blasphemy, that Vesuvius of profanity, forever in eruption. Does he {{know how to deal with}} that mob of roaring devils? Better than any man that lives; for he is the head devil of this world his own self, he is the match of the whole of them combined, and probably the father of most of them. She places him in temporary command until she can get to Blois herselfand then! Why, then she will certainly take them in hand personally, or I don't know her as well as I ought to, after all these years of intimacy. That will be a sight to seethat fair spirit in her white armor, delivering her will to that muck-heap, that rag-pile, that abandoned refuse of perdition." ...|$|E

The Confederates rebels are preparing themselves extensively for the coming spring and despite {{the severity of the}} season, they continue the fight. They besieged Montreal, which surrendered, and are presently close to Quebec, which I think will do the same soon... They are well entrenched near Boston... They have an unbelievable eagerness and goodwill: it is true they are led by capable people.Everyone here is a soldier, the troops are well clothed, well paid and well armed. They have more than 50,000 regular soldiers and an even larger number of volunteers who do not wish to be paid. Judge how men of this caliber will fight. They are more powerful than we could have thought, beyond imagination powerful; you will be astonished by it. Nothing shocks or frightens them, you can <b>count</b> <b>on</b> <b>that.</b> Independency is a certainty for 1776; there will be no drawing back..|$|E

Lane was <b>counting</b> <b>on</b> <b>that.</b> He must never even hint such a hope, but nevertheless he had it, he believed in it. Joshua Iden would have the scales torn from his eyes.
