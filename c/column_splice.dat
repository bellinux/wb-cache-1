40|$|A {{steel frame}} {{structure}} of a few storey building is considered in European project FRAMEUP. Each column of the building is constructed from steel profiles connected by column-to-column connection, called <b>column</b> <b>splice.</b> In FRAMEUP project new type of <b>column</b> <b>splice</b> connection is designed to facilitate assembly. This connection consists of a plate, called finger plate with characteristic shape of holes, called long open slotted holes. A <b>column</b> <b>splice</b> with long open holes {{is a type of}} friction connection, where finger plate transfer load between bottom of one column and top of a second part and preloaded bolts are used to clamp segments together. In this work, the behaviour of the connection is investigated. Moreover, general information about column splices, friction connection and loss of pretension are introduced in literature review. A recommendations, for the preloaded bolts are investigated in accordance with European standard EN 1993 - 1 - 8. An experimental static compression tests are performed in order to observe the real behaviour of the <b>column</b> <b>splice</b> with long open slotted holes. Several number of numerical tests are performed to predict behaviour of the connection by use of Abaqus software. The Numerical model is validated against experimental results. Further tests are performed in order to check an influence of other important factors on the behaviour of connection system. An influence of connection geometry i. e. filler plate thickness, characteristic of the surface and the material properties are analyzed. The variation of bolt forces as well as slip factor and reduction factor ks are investigated. Finally, experimental test and finite element method analysis are discussed and conclusion are given.

40|$|A <b>column</b> <b>splice</b> {{is part of}} {{the column}} and {{therefore}} must be designed for second order bending moments and shear forces in addition to the axial force. In this paper strength and stiffness requirements for column splices are derived on the basis of column stability considerations. A strength requirement for the <b>column</b> <b>splice</b> is suggested based on an imperfect column. A stiffness requirement is suggested by allowing a 5 % reduction in the Euler buckling load of the column. In order to test the suggested design requirements for column splices, full scale experimental tests on spliced columns were carried out. Three different column splices were investigated. Columns without splices were tested for reference purposes. All tests were performed three times.

The spandrel plates were located at each floor, transmitting shear stress between columns, allowing them {{to work together in}} resisting lateral loads.

30|$|It is {{important}} to construct perfectly continuous composite columns at all the sites to conduct high-resolution and high-precision correlations of dark and light layers in-between the sites. We conducted inter-hole correlation of all the recovered cores covering the lithological Unit I (Tada et al. 2015) at each site for this purpose. In addition, inter-hole correlation of cores enables us to precisely correlate off-splice parts of cores to the composite <b>columns</b> (<b>spliced</b> sections) {{so that we can}} use samples taken from off-splice parts of cores {{in the same way as}} those taken from the spliced parts and thus can drastically increase the amount of samples utilized for high-resolution studies.|$|R
40|$|Cantilevered {{reinforced}} concrete columns with a lap splice of the longitudinal reinforcement {{near the base}} can induce high moment demands on the splice region when lateral loads are present on the structure. Code design specifications typically require a conservative splice length to account for these high moment demands and their consequences of bond failure. The required splice length is calculated {{as a function of}} required development length, which {{is a function of the}} bond between the reinforcement and the surrounding concrete, and a factor depending on the section detailing. However, the effects of concrete deterioration due to alkali silica reaction (ASR) and/or delayed ettringite formation (DEF) may weaken the bond of the splice region enough to overcome the conservative splice length, potentially resulting in brittle failure of the column during lateral loading. This thesis presents the following results obtained from an experimental and analytical program. * Fabrication of large-scale specimens of typical <b>column</b> <b>splice</b> regions with concrete that is susceptible to ASR/DEF deterioration * Measurement of the large-scale specimen deterioration due to ASR/DEF accelerated deterioration * Analytical model of the <b>column</b> <b>splice</b> region based on flexure theory as a function of the development length of the reinforcement and a factor to account for deterioration of the bond due to ASR/DEF * Experimental behavior of two large-scale specimens that are not influenced by premature concrete deterioration due to ASR/DEF (control specimens). This experimental data is also used to calibrate the analytical model. The conclusions of the research are that the analytical model correlates well with the experimental behavior of the large-scale control specimens not influenced by ASR/DEF. The lap splice region behaved as expected and an over-strength in the splice region is evident. To account for ASR/DEF damage, the analytical model proposes a reduction factor to decrease the bond strength of the splice region to predict ultimate performance of the region with different levels of premature concrete deterioration...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} world {{population}} {{will be the}} challenge of the century regarding the carbon footprints. The human activities produce both direct and indirect carbon emission that is contributing to the climate change. The construction industry itself contributes around 30 percent of total carbon emissions in the world. Thus, the challenge is {{to solve the problem of}} meeting the increasing needs and expectations of a growing population while at the same time modifying the current production and consumption patterns to achieve a more sustainable development model. Based on this, the need for the sustainable structural element is inevitable. Extending the exploitation life of the structural element is one of the solutions that should be looked. Reusing instead of recycling the structural element is one of the ways to extend the exploitation life which can reduce the carbon emission. Therefore the innovation in the structural design to reduce the carbon emission is important. The purpose of this thesis is to study the feasibility of a conceptual design of demountable structural system. On the first part of the thesis, it investigated the structural behaviour of a composite floor beam that consists of steel beam, prefabricated concrete deck and a single embedded nut bolt shear connector in the SLS condition. To accommodate fabrication tolerance and construction process, the bolt shear connector must have enough clearance. Various bolt-hole gap in bolt shear connector is applied to see the effect on structural performance of composite floor beam in SLS. The study of demountable composite floor beam is performed by mean of analytical calculations and finite element analysis. It is found that the bolt-hole gap clearance influences the deflection of composite floor beam due to partial interaction between prefabricated concrete deck and steel beam which leads to incomplete interaction of composite floor beam. The bigger hole clearance, the higher deflection occurs on composite floor beam. The second part of the thesis explores the conceptual design of plug and play beam-column connection. The purpose of developing a plug and play beam-column connection is to reduce the construction time so that it is easy to be mounted and demounted. Two conceptual designs have been developed and were evaluated through FEA. The resistance of those two conceptual designs is found to be higher than fin-plate connection while the rotational stiffness of this plug-play connection can be classified as a nominally pinned joint. The last part of the thesis aims to see the possibility of having a non-symmetrical <b>column</b> <b>splice</b> connection on the column. This is interesting for the architect as it provides aesthetic benefit for the façade. The non-symmetrical <b>column</b> <b>splice</b> connection located on the corner is evaluated by FEA. The connection is a combination of end-plate and cover plate splice column connection. Due to unsymmetrical nature of the connection, the resistance and failure mode of the connection is different in a different orientation of the loading...|$|E

Joints in composite construction are also addressed through references to Eurocode 4 Design of composite steel and concrete structures Part 1 - 1 General rules and rules for buildings. Attention has to be duly paid to the joints when designing a steel or composite structure, {{in terms of the}} global safety of the construction, and also in terms of the overall cost, including fabrication, transportation and erection. Therefore, in this book, the design of the joints themselves is widely detailed, and aspects of selection of joint configuration and integration of the joints into the analysis and the design process of the whole construction are also fully covered. Connections using mechanical fasteners, welded connections, simple joints, moment-resisting joints and lattice girder joints are considered. Various joint configurations are treated, including beam-to-column, beam-to-beam, column bases, and beam and <b>column</b> <b>splice</b> configurations, under different loading situations (axial forces, shear forces, bending moments and their combinations). The book also briefly summarises the available knowledge relating to the application of the Eurocode rules to joints under fire, fatigue, earthquake, etc., and also to joints in a structure subjected to exceptional loadings, where the risk of progressive collapse has to be mitigated.

A plane frame specimen from the prototype was incorporated into {{the design of a}} test-bed of four full-scale, side-by-side nominally identical structures that could be evaluated independently. The testing of the first frame serves as the topic of this dissertation. The specimen was two bays x two stories x 9 -ft. wide. A new method for testing full-scale structures under seismic loads was proposed that used a hydraulic linear inertial shaker (LIS) to impart seismic loads. The response of the structure was monitored using 155 strain gages, 38 linear variable differential transformers, six string potentiometers, and 42 accelerometers. The response of the frame to a series of 25 load histories using the nees@UCLA LIS was marked by gradual structural softening and minimal yielding of the steel reinforcing throughout the structure. At a first interstory drift of 1. 5 % some yielding of the reinforcing bars was measured. Between 1. 5 % and 2 % first interstory drift, a global sway mechanism formed when the failure of a splice {{at the base of the}} first story west column led to a cascading set of failures within other first-story <b>column</b> <b>splices.</b> The experimental behavior suggests previous scaled testing of similar structures may have inadequately represented the vulnerability <b>column</b> <b>splices.</b> The design of the test-bed, response of the structure to seismic loads, qualitative evaluation of the test method, and implications on future research are discussed.

2500|$|The tube-frame design, earlier {{introduced}} by Fazlur Khan, {{was a new}} approach that allowed more open floor plans than the traditional design that distributed columns throughout the interior to support building loads.

The perimeter structure containing 59 columns per side was constructed with extensive use of prefabricated modular pieces, each consisting of three columns, three stories tall, connected by [...] plates. The spandrel plates were welded to the columns to create the modular pieces off-site at the fabrication shop. Adjacent modules were bolted together with the splices occurring at mid-span of the columns and spandrels. The spandrel plates were located at each floor, transmitting shear stress between columns, allowing them to work together in resisting lateral loads.

The commonly utilized welded unreinforced flange, bolted web connections were observed to experience brittle fractures {{in a number of}} buildings, even at low levels of seismic demand. A majority of these buildings have not been retrofitted and may be susceptible to structural collapse in a major earthquake. This dissertation presents a case study of retrofitting a 20 -story pre-Northridge steel moment-frame building. Twelve retrofit schemes are developed that present some range in degree of intervention. Three retrofitting techniques are considered: upgrading the brittle beam-to-column moment resisting connections, and implementing either conventional or buckling-restrained brace elements within the existing moment-frame bays. The retrofit schemes include some that are designed to the basic safety objective of ASCE- 41 Seismic Rehabilitation of Existing Buildings. Detailed finite element models of the base line building and the retrofit schemes are constructed. The models include considerations of brittle beam-to-column moment resisting connection fractures, <b>column</b> <b>splice</b> fractures, column baseplate fractures, accidental contributions from "simple" non-moment resisting beam-to-column connections to the lateral force-resisting system, and composite actions of beams with the overlying floor system. In addition, foundation interaction is included through nonlinear translational springs underneath basement columns. To investigate the effectiveness of the retrofit schemes, the building models are analyzed under ground motions from three large magnitude simulated earthquakes that cause intense shaking in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area, and under recorded ground motions from actual earthquakes. It is found that retrofit schemes that convert the existing moment-frames into braced-frames by implementing either conventional or buckling-restrained braces are effective in limiting structural damage and mitigating structural collapse.

40|$|Longitudinal steel {{lap splice}} is always {{required}} in reinforced concrete (RC) columns. Normally, in countries having high seismic risk, lap splices of longitudinal steel must be located around mid-height of the storey. However, in regions of low-medium seismic risk, including Hong Kong, lap splices of longitudinal steel begin right above the beam-column interface to facilitate ease of construction. Such splicing method would undesirably cause the column critical region {{to move away}} from the beam-column interface under inelastic deformation. In this paper, the effects of different lap splice locations of longitudinal steel on flexural strength and ductility of RC columns with concrete cube strength around 100 MPa are studied. Four RC column specimens, which contained no lap splice, all lap splices within and outside critical region, as well as lap splices in staggered manner, were tested under simultaneous compressive axial load and reversed cyclic inelastic displacement. It is evident from the results that the <b>column</b> containing lap <b>splices</b> within its critical region had the largest strength but the poorest ductility performance.

5000|$|The American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) 13th Edition Steel Design Manual section 16.1 chapter J-3 {{specifies}} {{the requirements}} for bolted structural connections. Structural bolts replaced rivets due to decreasing cost and increasing strength of structural bolts in the 20th century. Connections are formed with two types of joints: slip-critical connections and bearing connections. In slip-critical connections, movement of the connected parts is a serviceability condition and bolts are tightened to a minimum required pretension. Slip is prevented through friction of the [...] "faying" [...] surface, that is the plane of shear for the bolt and where two members make contact. Because friction {{is proportional to the}} normal force, connections must be sized with bolts numerous and large enough to provide the required load capacity. However, this greatly decreases the shear capacity of each bolt in the connection. The second type and more common connection is a bearing connection. In this type of connection the bolts carry the load through shear and are only tightened to a [...] "snug-fit". These connections require fewer bolts than slip-critical connections and therefore are a less expensive alternative. Slip-critical connections are more common on flange plates for beam and <b>column</b> <b>splices</b> and moment critical connections. Bearing type connections are used in light weight structures and in member connections where slip is not important and prevention of structural failure is the design constraint. Common bearing type connections include: shear tabs, beam supports, gusset plates in trusses.|$|R

Most {{of the damage}} structures were reinforced-concrete structures. From approximately 40 structures investigated by the authors, {{as part of a}} reconnaissance team, it was found that most of the damage was caused by improper construction, such as placement of <b>column</b> <b>splices</b> at <b>column</b> based. It was also found that structures strengthened following the first earthquake in February 2004, either by adding balcony or fa??ade columns, were almost collapse after the second earthquake in November 2004. Additional construction to old existing structures such as balcony without strengthening the existing structures changed the stiffness and the strength configuration resulted in failure. Column failure at the mid-height was an example of this phenomenon. This paper presents results of post-earthquake investigation carried out following the second earthquake in November 2004. The investigated buildings were categorized into several damage levels, and then proposed to be repaired, demolished or reconstructed. One building namely Tabernakel Church was analyzed using the available computer software to check the possible cause for the major damage. It was selected for this study because the building had been repaired and strengthened after the first earthquake, but severely damaged after the second earthquake. The analysis shows that the available reinforcing bars were still adequate, even after the addition of new elements. Other possible cause of the major damage was the formation of plastic hinges after the first earthquake at several locations, but due to inadequate available data, this was difficult to explain...|$|R

The RC <b>columns</b> with lap <b>spliced</b> reinforcements {{at the base}} show less ductile behaviour than those with continuous reinforcements. SMA wire jackets can increase the ductility of the RC <b>columns</b> with lap <b>spliced</b> reinforcements and thus this study used the two kinds of SMA wires to retrofit such RC columns; {{the first one is}} NiTi SMA wire that remains in martensite at room temperature and the other is NiTiNb SMA wire that is austenite at room temperature. Both the SMA wires show shape memory effect and provide active confinement for concrete. The SMA wires were prestrained to 7 % strain and released. At the state, some residual strain remained and can be recovered by heating. The prestrained SMA wires were wrapped around the plastic hinge region of the RC columns and then the temperature of the wires raised by heating. Then, the SMA wires induced an active confinement on the RC columns. Each wire was measured for recovery and residual stress to obtain the information of active confinement. This active confinement and the resistance of the SMA wires increased the ductile behaviour of the RC columns in lateral direction. The parameters in this study are the kinds of SMA and the pitch of the wires. All types of the specimens retrofitted the SMA wires showed good ductile behaviour without degrading the flexural strength...|$|R

The first phase of studies include testing and analyzing more than sixty large-scale specimens which were designed and constructed to simulate the worst scenario of the construction practice in Taiwan prior to 1987.

Three full-scale column specimens were constructed and tested to failure under quasi-static cyclic‐reversed loads. All specimens were reinforced with GFRP longitudinal bars and transverse stirrups. The columns had 350 -mm square cross section and 1850 -mm cantilever length. Each column was cast on heavily steel-RC footing measuring 1400 × 1400 × 600 mm 3, which was constructed to simulate rotational fixity of the column and to force the failure to occur in the <b>column.</b> The <b>splice</b> length for each column was equal to sixty times the diameter of the longitudinal column reinforcement. The test variable was the spacing between the transverse GFRP reinforcement (75, 100 and 150 mm).

Thirteen cantilever-type specimens with either continuous longitudinal reinforcement (smooth or deformed) or lap splicing of longitudinal bars at the floor level were constructed and tested. Experimental results indicated that TRM jacketing is quite effective as a means of increasing the cyclic deformation capacity of old-type RC columns with poor detailing, by delaying bar buckling and by preventing splitting bond failures in <b>columns</b> with lap <b>spliced</b> bars.

40|$|Performance of bridges during {{previous}} earthquakes {{has demonstrated}} that many structural failures {{could be attributed to}} seismic deficiencies in bridge columns. Lack of transverse reinforcement and inadequate splicing of longitudinal reinforcement in potential plastic hinge regions of columns constitute primary reasons for their poor performance. A number of column retrofit techniques have been developed and tested in the past. These techniques include steel jacketing, reinforced concrete jacketing and use of transverse prestressing (RetroBelt) for concrete confinement, shear strengthening and splice clamping. A new retrofit technique, involving fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) jacketing has emerged as a convenient and structurally sound alternative with improved durability. The new technique, although received acceptance in the construction industry, needs to be fully developed as a viable seismic retrofit methodology, supported by reliable design and construction procedures. The successful application of externally applied FRP jackets to existing columns, coupled with deteriorating bridge infrastructure, raised the possibility of using FRP reinforcement for new construction. Stay-in-place formwork, in the form of FRP tubes are being researched for its feasibility. The FRP stay-in-place tubes offer ease in construction, convenient formwork, and when left in place, the protection of concrete against environmental effects, including the protection of steel reinforcement against corrosion, while also serving as column transverse reinforcement. Combined experimental and analytical research was conducted in the current project to i) improve the performance of FRP column jacketing for existing bridge columns, and ii) to develop FRP stay-in-place formwork for new bridge columns. The experimental phase consisted of design, construction and testing of 7 full-scale reinforced concrete bridge columns under simulated seismic loading. The columns represented both existing seismically deficient bridge columns, and new columns in stay-in-place formwork. The existing columns were deficient in either shear, or flexure, where the flexural deficiencies stemmed from lack of concrete confinement and/or use of inadequately spliced longitudinal reinforcement. The test parameters included cross-sectional shape (circular or square), reinforcement <b>splicing,</b> <b>column</b> shear span for flexure and shear-dominant behaviour, FRP jacket thickness, as well as use of FRP tubes as stay-in-place formwork, with or without internally embedded FRP crossties. The columns were subjected to a constant axial compression and incrementally increasing inelastic deformation reversals. The results, presented and discussed in this thesis, indicate that the FRP retrofit methodology provides significant confinement to circular and square columns, improving column ductility substantially. The FRP jack also improved diagonal tension capacity of columns, changing brittle shear-dominant column behavior to ductile flexure dominant response. The jackets, when the transverse strains are controlled, are able to improve performance of inadequately <b>spliced</b> circular <b>columns,</b> while remain somewhat ineffective in improving the performance of <b>spliced</b> square <b>columns.</b> FRP stay-in-place formwork provides excellent ductility to circular and square columns in new concrete columns, offering tremendous potential for use in practice. The analytical phase of the project demonstrates that the current analytical techniques for column analysis can be used for columns with external FRP reinforcement, provided that appropriate material models are used for confined concrete, FRP composites and reinforcement steel. Plastic analysis for flexure, starting with sectional moment-curvature analysis and continuing into member analysis incorporating the formation of plastic hinging, provide excellent predictions of inelastic force-deformation envelopes of recorded hysteretic behaviour. A displacement based design procedure adapted to FRP jacketed columns, as well as columns in FRP stay-in-place formwork provide a reliable design procedure for both retrofitting existing columns and designing new FRP reinforced concrete columns...|$|R
