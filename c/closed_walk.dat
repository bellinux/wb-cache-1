50|$|In his 1736 {{paper on}} the Seven Bridges of Königsberg, widely {{considered}} to be the birth of graph theory, Leonhard Euler proved that, for a finite undirected graph to have a <b>closed</b> <b>walk</b> that visits each edge exactly once, it is necessary and sufficient that it be connected except for isolated vertices (that is, all edges are contained in one component) and have even degree at each vertex. The corresponding characterization for the existence of a <b>closed</b> <b>walk</b> visiting each edge exactly once in a directed graph is that the graph be strongly connected and have equal numbers of incoming and outgoing edges at each vertex. In either case, the resulting walk is known as an Euler cycle or Euler tour. If a finite undirected graph has even degree at each of its vertices, regardless of whether it is connected, then it is possible to find a set of simple cycles that together cover each edge exactly once: this is Veblen's theorem. When a connected graph does not meet the conditions of Euler's theorem, a <b>closed</b> <b>walk</b> of minimum length covering each edge at least once can nevertheless be found in polynomial time by solving the route inspection problem.|$|E
5000|$|In graph theory, a {{cycle is}} {{a path of}} edges and {{vertices}} wherein a vertex is reachable from itself.There are several different types of cycles, principally a <b>closed</b> <b>walk</b> and a simple cycle; also, e.g., {{an element of the}} cycle space of the graph.|$|E
50|$|A simple cycle may {{be defined}} either as a <b>closed</b> <b>walk</b> with no repetitions of {{vertices}} and edges allowed, other than the repetition of the starting and ending vertex, or as the set of edges in such a walk. The two definitions are equivalent in directed graphs, where simple cycles are also called directed cycles: the cyclic sequence of vertices and edges in a walk is completely determined by the set of edges that it uses. In undirected graphs the set of edges of a cycle can be traversed by a walk in either of two directions, giving two possible directed cycles for every undirected cycle. (For closed walks more generally, in directed or undirected graphs, the multiset of edges does not unambiguously determine the vertex ordering.) A circuit can be a <b>closed</b> <b>walk</b> allowing repetitions of vertices but not edges; however, {{it can also be}} a simple cycle, so explicit definition is recommended when it is used.|$|E
