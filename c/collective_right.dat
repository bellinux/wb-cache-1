This chapter aims to classify <b>collective</b> cultural <b>rights</b> in international human rights instruments and to explore how these rights fit in the general framework of international human rights law. In much of the debate on <b>collective</b> <b>rights,</b> cultural rights are used as examples, because cultural rights are rights that clearly demand a collective approach. This chapter provides various examples of legal provisions in international human rights instruments that can be classified as <b>collective</b> cultural <b>rights</b> to show the different forms these <b>rights</b> may take. <b>Collective</b> cultural <b>rights</b> in international human rights law are challenged by different contentious (legal) issues. For instance, {{there is a lack}} of clarity concerning the object and the subject of <b>collective</b> <b>rights</b> and the possible tension between <b>collective</b> <b>rights</b> and individual rights. The inclusion of <b>collective</b> cultural <b>rights</b> in international human rights law reaffirms the importance of collective (cultural) interests and collective subjects, but does not provide clear answers to all these issues. The two central components of <b>collective</b> cultural <b>rights,</b> namely ‘community’ and ‘culture’, remain difficult to define. Moreover, they are not static notions, which makes their translation into substantive rights to be invoked and enjoyed by individuals and communities a complex matter...|$|R

500|$|There {{were five}} lynchings in South Carolina during Tillman's first term, and {{thirteen}} during his second.

Yet as governor, he was sworn to uphold the rule of law. He attempted to finesse the matter by seeking to appeal to both sides, demanding that the law be followed, but that he would, as he stated in 1892, [...] "willingly lead a mob in lynching a Negro who had committed an assault on a white woman". Under criticism, he amended this to a willingness to lead the lynching of [...] "a man of any color who assaults a virtuous woman of any color"—the adjective [...] "virtuous" [...] limiting the commitment, in Tillman's view, to assaults on white women.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{important}} to note that this right only protects the right of individuals to form associations and not associations themselves. Consequently, government legislation affecting the powers of established labour associations do not necessarily invoke section 2(d). It is only where legislation restricts the associative nature of an activity will section 2 be invoked. However, in a landmark decision, Health Services and Support – Facilities Subsector Bargaining Assn. v. British Columbia (2007), the Supreme Court ruled that freedom of association guaranteed by s.2(d) includes a procedural right to collective bargaining. [...] The Court ruled in this case that legislation that [...] "substantially interferes" [...] with the process of collective bargaining is a s.2(d) infringement. [...] The test for [...] "substantial interference" [...] is twofold: (1) the importance of the matter affected to the process of collective bargaining, and more specifically, the capacity of union members to come together and pursue collective goals in concert; and (2) the manner in which the measure impacts on the <b>collective</b> <b>right</b> to good faith negotiation and consultation. [...] It is not certain whether the decision in the Health Services case overturns jurisprudence arising from the so-called [...] "labour trilogy" [...] cases of 1987 that found that s.2(d) did not include a right to collective bargaining.|$|E

40|$|Although <b>collective</b> {{cultural}} <b>rights</b> {{are included}} in international human rights law, their precise place and their nature and significance are not well-explored or understood. This paper aims to show where <b>collective</b> cultural <b>rights</b> {{can be found in}} international human rights law and explore how these rights fit in the general body and framework of international human rights law. The starting point in this chapter is international human rights law, which implies that the analysis of <b>collective</b> cultural <b>rights</b> is framed by positive law and international legal instruments, such as treaties and conventions, as well as by soft law instruments, such as declarations, recommendations and resolutions. In this paper, the two categories of <b>collective</b> <b>rights</b> and cultural rights are defined, drawing a distinction between a) different types of <b>collective</b> <b>rights,</b> including rights for collectivities as such, rights for individuals as members of collectivities, and <b>rights</b> with a <b>collective</b> interest or object; and b) between different types of cultural rights, including rights that explicitly refer to ‘culture’ and rights that relate to culture or have a cultural dimension. This paper furthermore analyses various contentious issues surrounding <b>collective</b> <b>rights</b> and cultural rights in international human rights law, including the lack of clarity on the object and subject of these rights. The paper then outlines the different forms of <b>collective</b> cultural <b>rights</b> in international human rights law, by providing examples of legal provisions in international human rights law that can be classified as <b>collective</b> cultural <b>rights.</b> Finally, the paper elaborates on how collective subjects and collective cultural interests are integrated in international human rights law and analyses how and to what extent <b>collective</b> cultural <b>rights</b> provisions provide answers to the above-noted issues...|$|R
60|$|The billowy {{effect of}} the Palatine, {{inconvenient}} to the explorer, is its greatest charm from afar, in whatever morning or evening light, or sun or rain, you get its soft, brownish, greenish, velvety masses. Distance on it is best, and distance in {{time as well as}} space. If you can believe the stucco reconstruction opposite the Forum gate, ruin has been even kinder to the Palatine than to the Forum, with which it was equally ugly when in repair, if taken in the altogether, however beautiful in detail. As you see it in that reproduction, it is a horror, and a very vulgar horror, such a horror as only unlimited wealth and uncontrolled power can produce. If you will think of individualism gone mad, and each successive personality crushing out and oversloughing some other, without that regard for proportion and propriety which only the sense of a superior <b>collective</b> <b>right</b> can inspire, you will imagine the Palatine. Mount Morris, at One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street, if unscrupulously built upon by the multimillionaires thronging to New York and seeking to house themselves each more splendidly and spaciously than the other, would offer a suggestion in miniature of what the Palatine seems to have been like in its glory. But the ruined Mount Morris, even allowing for the natural growth of the landscape in two thousand years, could show no such prospect twenty centuries hence as we got that morning from a bit of wilding garden near the Convent of San Bonaventura, on the brow of the Palatine. Some snowy tops pillowed themselves on the utmost horizon, and across the Campagna the broken aqueducts stalked and fell down and stumbled to their legs again. The Baths of Caracalla bulked up in rugged, monstrous fragments, and then in the foreground, filling the whole eye, the Colosseum rose and stood, and all Rome sank round it. The Forum lay deep under us, vainly struggling with the broken syllables of its demolition to impart a sense of its past, and at our feet in that bit of garden where the roses were blooming and the plum-trees were blowing and the birds were singing, there stretched itself in the grass a fallen pillar wreathed with the folds of a marble serpent, the emblem of the oldest worship under the sun, as I was proud to remember without present help. It was the same immemorial, universal faith which the Mound Builders of our own West symbolized in the huge earthen serpents they shaped uncounted ages before the red savages came to wonder at them, and doubtless it had been welcomed by Rome in her large, loose, cynical toleration, together with cults which, like that of Isis and Osiris, were fads of yesterday beside it. Somehow it gave the humanest touch in the complex impression of the overhistoried scene. It made one feel very old, yet very young--old with the age and young with the youth of the world--and very much at home.|$|E

40|$|The {{world is}} now going through a {{paradigm}} shift. The final curtain has {{come down on the}} international system founded at Bretton Woods and Yalta. However, the lines of the new system are not yet readily discernible. The euphoria of 1989 has been replaced by the angst associated with the birth of the successor system. Conflict between ethnic groups is reaching new heights in this atmosphere. Although ethnic group conflict has been a serious problem throughout the century, it again comes to center stage with a new sense of urgency as the violence associated with such conflict reaches proportions not seen since the close of World War II. The restructuring of the international system is certainly an important factor in explaining the violent tendency of the current ethnic conflicts. However, these problems will not disappear with {{the emergence of a new}} international system. As technology binds the world closer together and increases our dependence on one another, contacts between ethnic groups will continue to increase both in frequency and intensity. <b>Collective</b> <b>rights,</b> rights which are rested in ethnic groups as opposed to individuals, have been adopted in some nations with plural societies as a method for solving such conflicts. Yet, in contrast to individual-based rights, there is not a generally accepted justification for the application of these types of human rights. There are, in fact, those who argue that <b>collective</b> <b>rights</b> are not human rights at all. If we are not able to offer an internationally acceptable justification as to why we should resort to <b>collective</b> <b>rights</b> as human rights, then these types of rights cannot be a truly viable alternative for tackling the ethnic conflicts which will increasingly destabilize the international system. The lack of a generally accepted justification of <b>collective</b> <b>rights</b> promises to lead to a piecemeal approach to the development of these rights. A likely consequence of this could be a situation where we neither arrive at a sufficient understanding of what types of states should resort to <b>collective</b> <b>rights,</b> nor an understanding of which types of <b>collective</b> <b>rights</b> are best suited to solving the various forms of ethnic conflict. The ultimate result of such an approach could be an erosion of individual-based rights protections. The goal of this paper is to present a justification for <b>collective</b> <b>rights.</b> I present a justification for group-based rights which does not undermine the status of the individual-based rights which are the hallmark of the United Nations' system of human rights guarantees. I argue that liberal political philosophy, which has played, and continues to play, a major role in shaping the United Nations' system of human rights protections, cannot provide a justification for <b>collective</b> <b>rights</b> which can allow for the application of these rights in all of the situations that may require such a solution. Consequently, also suggest that the difficulties faced by the United Nations in addressing the issue of <b>collective</b> <b>rights</b> are, in part, a result of the influence of liberalism on the human rights system. I then offer a justification for both individual and <b>collective</b> <b>rights</b> which is based upon the work of Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann. I argue that their theory can provide a fundamental justification for the systematic application of <b>collective</b> <b>rights</b> solutions which does not undermine the existing individual-based rights guarantees in the U. N. 's system when the goal of recognizing a collective rights-bearer is to prevent discrimination and guarantee the equal enjoyment of human rights by all. My arguments pivot on the concept of the individual. In short, I argue that the liberal idea of the individual is not compatible with the concept of the individual inherent in the United Nations' system. I further argue that Berger and Luckmann's theory of the individual is in harmony with the U. N. 's understanding of the individual and can, therefore, provide a justification for <b>collective</b> <b>rights</b> which does not undermine the current international system of human rights protections...|$|R
