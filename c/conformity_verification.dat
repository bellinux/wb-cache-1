40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{describing}} and analyzing not only functional but also performance properties of software architectures in a formal framework. We thus develop an architectural description language with a precise syntax and semantics and we illustrate the various kinds of analysis that can be conducted on its descriptions, such as architectural compatibility and <b>conformity</b> checking, functional <b>verification,</b> and performance evaluation. The proposed architectural description language is based on stochastically timed process algebras by virtue of their compositionality, which makes them suited to work with at the architectural level...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} aiming to {{implement}} the general principles of risk prevention at employer’s level, with respect to occupational risks evaluation, the elimination of risk and accident factors, and information of workers which are using the machinery in the forestry sector. For the use of machinery in the forestry sector {{in terms of economic}} performance and a level of maximum safety, it is necessary to ensure the user guides set by the manufacturer in terms of commissioning, use and to provide appropriate safe working operations and interventions and to guarantee the technical and environmental requirements, including appropriate measures and means of protection against accidents and occupational disease. The impact of occupational risks for machinery used in this sector can be reduced through the application of modern principles in conformity assessment and certification and, where appropriate, through technical diagnostics and inspection, taking into account the provisions of the new Machinery Directive 2006 / 42 / EC which is imposing the obligation of manufacturer to implement conformity assessment procedures in accordance with the methods of assessment and verification of safety at the certification bodies, notified at the European Commission. The paper aims to develop modern technical tools for <b>conformity</b> assessment and <b>verification</b> of this category of machines used in the forestry sector that would provide prerequisite for increasing competitiveness of employers in the market economy. Applying these tools of modern technology for manufacturers and users of this category of machinery provides the necessary conditions for placing on the market of safe products with a appropriate safety level, in the intended using conditions, in order to guarantee the essential requirements for safety and health, technical and environmental conditions, including measures and means of protection. The result of this research is to develop technical tools needed to assess compliance on effective occupational risk management for professional machinery used in the forestry sector...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{an overview of}} performance based testing methodology for concrete durability and work currently underway jointly at Queens University Belfast and Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh, to undertake this research under a EPSRC funded project (EP/G 02152 X/ 1). EN 206 - 1 superseded BS 5328 on 1 st December 2003 and allows designers and producers to use {{a wide range of}} cements and aggregate types for a variety of exposure conditions. In this new standard, the durability of concrete is specified in terms of the constituent materials of concrete, properties of fresh and hardened concrete, limitations for concrete composition, specification of concrete, delivery of fresh concrete, production control procedures, conformity criteria and evaluation of <b>conformity</b> and <b>verification</b> of these properties. Within this, six basic forms of exposure is also specified, namely XO (no risk of corrosion), XC (Corrosion induced by carbonation), XF (Freeze / thaw attack), XS (Corrosion induced by chlorides from seawater), XD (Corrosion induced by chlorides other than from seawater) and XA (Chemical attack). According to EN 206 - 1, the performance method adopted should be based on satisfactory experience with local practices in local environments from data obtained from an established performance test method for the relevant mechanism, or using appropriate proven predictive models. Therefore, the methods that may be used include those methods based on:- · long-term experience of local materials and practices and on detailed knowledge of the local environment. · approved and proven tests that are representative of actual conditions and have approved performance criteria. · analytical models that have been calibrated against test data representative of actual conditions in practice. The concrete composition and the constituent materials should be closely defined to enable the level of performance to be maintained. In order to determine the best methods for assessing concrete durability for performance, it is important to review those methods which have been developed and used in Queens University Belfast and Heriot Watt University to test for permeability, diffusion and absorption as well as electrical methods used to assess if the performance criteria have been achieved in structures using non-destructive testing methods. Prior to specifying durability performance testing methods, a review of previous projects where limits on permeability, diffusion, electrical resistivity etc, are presented along with the various durability tests used to assess these limits. The examples given are from a number of projects in the UK, Ireland and Europe of varying complexity and size. Due to the relatively small number of such examples in the UK and Ireland, the need for the research presented here is further justified. The proposed experimental work for the EPSRC project is presented which includes a breakdown of the concrete samples, tests and details of a new marine exposure site on the Northwest coast of Ireland. Based on the findings of this experimental work and the numerical calibration using the ClinConc model, development of a methodology for testing the concrete durability to assess the performance limits set will be determined. Through this work, the performance methods adopted will satisfy the EN 206 - 1 guidelines above...|$|R
