5|$|A {{planar graph}} with {{four or more}} {{vertices}} is maximal (no more edges <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> while preserving planarity) {{if and only if}} its dual graph is both 3-vertex-connected and 3-regular.|$|E
5|$|Analog {{computers}} {{work directly}} with physical quantities, so their addition mechanisms {{depend on the}} form of the addends. A mechanical adder might represent two addends as the positions of sliding blocks, in which case they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> with an averaging lever. If the addends are the rotation speeds of two shafts, they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> with a differential. A hydraulic adder can add the pressures in two chambers by exploiting Newton's second law to balance forces on an assembly of pistons. The most common situation for a general-purpose analog computer is to add two voltages (referenced to ground); this can be accomplished roughly with a resistor network, but a better design exploits an operational amplifier.|$|E
50|$|Patches for <b>CAN</b> <b>were</b> <b>added</b> in the 2.6.25 Linux kernel. Meanwhile some {{controller}} drivers <b>were</b> <b>added</b> {{and work}} <b>is</b> {{going on to}} add drivers {{for a variety of}} controllers.|$|R

5|$|Fillet is {{the curved}} {{juncture}} of two surfaces {{that would have}} otherwise met at a sharp corner or edge. Simply, fillets <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> to a die casting to remove undesirable edges and corners.|$|E
5|$|In the US, the {{additive}} is not {{for direct}} consumer sale. Lean finely textured beef can constitute up to 15% of ground beef without additional labeling, and it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> to other meat products such as beef-based processed meats.|$|E
5|$|When not served alone, falafel {{is often}} served with flat or unleavened bread {{when it is}} wrapped within lafa or stuffed in a hollow pita. Tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, and other garnishes <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added.</b> Falafel is {{commonly}} accompanied by tahini.|$|E

5|$|As for {{the most}} clues {{possible}} in a Sudoko while still not rendering a unique solution, it is four short of a full grid (77). If two instances of two numbers each are missing and the cells they are to occupy are the corners of an orthogonal rectangle, and exactly two of these cells are within one region, {{there are two ways}} the last digits <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> (two solutions).|$|E
5|$|For example, infant {{formulas}} traditionally were {{lacking the}} MFGM because this fraction is lost during regular dairy processing. However, more {{recent advances in}} technology have facilitated the separation of MFGM from the fat globule, allowing bovine MFGM to be added in concentrated form. The MFGM fraction is now commercially available and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> to infant formula or other nutritional products.|$|E
5|$|In Swedish orthography, {{the colon}} {{is used in}} a similar manner as in English, with some exceptions: the colon is used for some abbreviations, such as 3:e for tredje ("third") and S:t for Sankt ("Saint"), and for all types of endings that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> to numbers, letters and abbreviations, such as a:et ("the a") and CD:n ("the CD"), or the genitive form USA:s ("USA's").|$|E
50|$|Triples <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>added</b> {{with the}} add function: add((subject, predicate, object)).|$|R

50|$|Code <b>can</b> <b>be</b> readily <b>added</b> to {{generate}} the above outputs graphically.|$|R
5|$|Plutonium alloys can be {{produced}} by adding a metal to molten plutonium. If the alloying metal is sufficiently reductive, plutonium <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> {{in the form of}} oxides or halides. The δ phase plutonium–gallium and plutonium–aluminium alloys are produced by adding plutonium(III) fluoride to molten gallium or aluminium, which has the advantage of avoiding dealing directly with the highly reactive plutonium metal.|$|E
5|$|To make {{brominated}} polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can {{be incorporated}} into the polymer during polymerisation. One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process. For example, vinyl bromide can be used in the production of polyethylene, polyvinylchloride or polypropylene. Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process For example, tetrabromobisphenol A <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> to polyesters or epoxy resins, where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxys used in printed circuit boards are normally made from such flame retardant resins, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products (FR-4 and FR-2). In some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after polymerisation. For example, decabromodiphenyl ether <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> to the final polymers.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{ice cream}} is frozen egg custard with {{flavours}} added. Blumenthal whisks egg yolks with sugar until the sugar {{interacts with the}} proteins in the yolk, creating a network of proteins. The entire substance turns white, at which point flavouring <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> and cooked in. While stirring the mixture, Blumenthal cools it {{as fast as possible}} using liquid nitrogen.|$|E
50|$|MoonCalc {{is a basic}} linear {{scientific}} calculator which <b>can</b> optionally <b>be</b> <b>added</b> to MoonShell.|$|R

5000|$|Edges <b>can</b> <b>be</b> either <b>added</b> or deleted (this <b>can</b> <b>be</b> called fully dynamic connectivity).|$|R
5|$|A 1-forest, {{sometimes}} called a maximal pseudoforest, is a pseudoforest to which no more edges <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> without causing some {{component of the}} graph to contain multiple cycles. If a pseudoforest contains a tree {{as one of its}} components, it cannot be a 1-forest, for one can add either an edge connecting two vertices within that tree, forming a single cycle, or an edge connecting that tree to some other component. Thus, the 1-forests are exactly the pseudoforests in which every component is a 1-tree.|$|E
5|$|A lack of {{fluorine}} in {{the diet}} {{is the cause of}} a greatly increased incidence of dental caries. Fluoride salts <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> to table salt with the goal of reducing tooth decay, especially in countries that have not benefited from fluoridated toothpastes and fluoridated water. The practice is more common in some European countries where water fluoridation is not carried out. In France, 35% of the table salt sold contains added sodium fluoride.|$|E
5|$|Blackcurrants {{are also}} used in savoury cooking because their {{astringency}} creates added flavour in many sauces, meat and other dishes and they are included in some unusual combinations of foods. They <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> to tomato and mint to make a salad, used to accompany roast or grilled lamb, used to accompany seafood and shellfish, used as a dipping sauce at barbecues, blended with mayonnaise, used to invigorate bananas and other tropical fruits, combined with dark chocolate or added to mincemeat in traditional mince pies at Christmas.|$|E

5|$|Decimal {{fractions}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> by {{a simple}} modification of the above process. One aligns two decimal fractions above each other, with the decimal point in the same location. If necessary, one can add trailing zeros to a shorter decimal {{to make it the}} same length as the longer decimal. Finally, one performs the same addition process as above, except the decimal point is placed in the answer, exactly where it was placed in the summands.|$|E
5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{supplied}} by a separate 1,074 litre (276 US Gallon, 230 Imperial Gallon) fuel tank using dual booster pumps. Optional {{fourth and fifth}} tanks <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> {{to act as a}} reservoir supply, topping up the main tanks during flight, increasing range or endurance. The AW101 can also be outfitted with a probe for aerial refuelling. Self-sealing fuel tanks are an optional item to be selected by the customer. An inlet particle separator system can be installed, protecting the engine when operating in sandy environments.|$|E
5|$|In the 2010s, hot {{chocolate}} is consumed {{throughout the world}} and comes in multiple variations, including the spiced chocolate para mesa of Latin America, the very thick cioccolata calda served in Italy and chocolate a la taza served in Spain, and the thinner hot cocoa consumed in the United States. Prepared {{hot chocolate}} can be purchased {{from a range of}} establishments, including cafeterias, fast food restaurants, coffeehouses and cafes. Powdered hot chocolate mixes, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> to boiling water or hot milk to make the drink at home, are sold at grocery stores.|$|E
