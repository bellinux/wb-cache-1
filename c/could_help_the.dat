25|$|In 1561, {{during an}} {{audience}} held in Santo Domingo, it was recommended that Isla de la Mona {{should become a}} part of that colony (which at the time occupied the eastern half of Hispaniola). The reasons offered were simply that the island was closer to Santo Domingo (presently the Dominican Republic) than to Puerto Rico, and that it had a small population which <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> colony's economy in overall agricultural production. However, the petition was turned down and the island continued to remain politically part of Puerto Rico.|$|E

Garretson informed police that he had no involvement in the murders and did not know anything that <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> investigation. Police accepted his explanation and he was released.|$|E
25|$|When the war began, the 13 colonies {{lacked a}} {{professional}} army or navy. Each colony sponsored local militia. Militiamen were lightly armed, had little training, and usually {{did not have}} uniforms. Their units served {{for only a few}} weeks or months at a time, were reluctant to travel far from home and thus were unavailable for extended operations, and lacked the training and discipline of soldiers with more experience. If properly used, however, their numbers <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> Continental armies overwhelm smaller British forces, as at the battles of Concord, Bennington and Saratoga, and the siege of Boston. Both sides used partisan warfare but the Americans effectively suppressed Loyalist activity when British regulars were not in the area.|$|E

25|$|Despite the price, the 1990s {{became an}} era of {{experimentation}} to see what else growth hormone <b>could</b> <b>help.</b> <b>The</b> medical literature of the decade contains hundreds of reports of small trials of GH use in nearly every type of growth failure and shortness imaginable. In most cases, the growth responses were modest. For conditions with a large enough potential market, more rigorous trials were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies that were making growth hormone to achieve approval to market for those specific indications. Turner syndrome and chronic renal failure were {{the first of these}} “nonGH-deficient causes of shortness” to receive FDA approval for GH treatment, and Prader-Willi syndrome and intrauterine growth retardation followed. Similar expansion of use occurred in Europe.|$|E

25|$|On his {{way back}} to Japan, Perry {{anchored}} off of Keelung in Formosa, known today as Taiwan, for ten days. Perry and crewmembers landed on Formosa and investigated the potential of mining the coal deposits in that area. He emphasized in his reports that Formosa provided a convenient, mid-way trade location. Perry's reports noted that the island was very defensible and it could serve as a base for exploration in a similar way that Cuba had done for the Spanish in the Americas. Occupying Formosa <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> United States counter European monopolization of the major trade routes. The United States government failed to respond to Perry's proposal to claim sovereignty over Formosa.|$|E

He again reluctantly accepting, believing he would be defeated {{and not have to}} serve in the office. He was overwhelmingly defeated in the election, finished out his two remaining years as a state senator, and returned to his farm in 1892. The following year the nation was adversely affected by the Panic of 1893, leading to a collapse of farm and produce value. Across the state, farmers began to lose their land to their lenders. The following year in the 1894 mid-term elections the Republicans swept to power in the statehouse, and took control of the Indiana General Assembly. As a farmer, Mount was also affected by the economic downturn and decided a return to politics was the best way he <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> situation.|$|E
25|$|The best-known {{representative}} of the Bohemian Reformation is Jan Hus. He was an influential university teacher and a popular preacher in Bethlehem Chapel in the Old Town of Prague. The chapel was founded already in 1391 {{in the spirit of}} the nascent Bohemian Reformation. It was intended solely for sermons in the Czech language and it could admit 3,000 people. Jan Hus and his friends (e. g. Jacob of Mies) were skeptical about the idea of conciliarism which called for a church reform from above via cardinals and theologians. For them the cardinals and theologians were bearers of the same corruption as the papacy itself. Hus believed that the head of the Church was Jesus Christ rather than the pope. In some issues they were inspired by the ideas of an Oxford theologian and philosopher John Wycliffe. It can be seen in their cooperation with the secular power which supported them. Together with Wycliffe they thought that aristocracy <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> church to become poor and focused only on spiritual issues by confiscation of its property. In 1412 Jan Hus criticized selling indulgences which led to an unrest in Prague suppressed by the city council.|$|E
25|$|Water {{investment}} planning for rural areas is {{done at the}} district level by the respective water departments. In 2009 the NGO WaterAid studied the local government planning process for water investments {{in four of the}} country's 99 rural districts, namely in Mpwapwa, Kongwa, Iramba and Nzega. Planning begins with long wish-lists based on demands from the village level. Since real priorities are difficult to identify, one selection criterion used is the balance of money held in the village water fund. This is seen as a sign of community ownership and can be easily explained to councillors and villagers. Other purported criteria are health statistics and data collected from a waterpoint mapping exercise, but they are not given high priority in practice. Selection is done {{in such a way that}} water projects are equally divided between the constituencies of the district’s Members of Parliament. Furthermore, councilors steer projects to villages in their wards, with more dynamic councillors exerting greater influence. Another de facto criterion is the previous track record in caring for infrastructure: In some areas handpumps have been stolen, making it hard to justify new investments. Communities close to town, located on main roads or with existing social services have an advantage in the decision-making process, since officials visit them more often and the cost of providing infrastructure is lower. The WaterAid report suggests that if there was better availability of data on rural water supply infrastructure this <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> representatives of underserved communities to lobby on behalf of their constituents.|$|E

On 10 August, Carrick was recalled to the England squad by Hodgson for a friendly match against Italy on 15 August. He played the full 90 minutes in the 2–1 victory over the Azzurri in Switzerland and also took over the captain's armband from Frank Lampard for the final 20 minutes.|$|E

500|$|The stay-at-home dad {{arrangement}} {{allows the}} mother {{to work without}} having to use a daycare or a nanny. This arrangement prevents the mother from {{having to deal with}} the stress of finding acceptable childcare, checking backgrounds, and paying for care. This arrangement also can help ensure that the family's values are being upheld and instilled in the children. Free from the stress of childcare, the working mother is able to actively pursue their career. This allows for a more relaxed working environment for the mother and allows her to focus on her career. [...] If the mother has a higher paying job, this extra income will allow for savings to be made for the children, these savings <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> mother later on pay for university for the child and/or children. Thus, she can advance her career and provide more money for the family. It puts a sound mind for the mother knowing that the child/children are at a safe place with the father having the same safety and values as the mother. These are the same advantages for the father from having a stay-at-home mom arrangement.|$|E
