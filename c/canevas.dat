6000|$|Ar {{four o'clock}} on Monday {{afternoon}} the curtain rose on [...] "Figaro-Scaramouche" [...] {{to an audience}} that filled {{three quarters of the}} market-hall. M. Binet attributed this good attendance to the influx of people to Guichen for the fair, and to the magnificent parade of his company through the streets of the township at the busiest time of the day. Andre-Louis attributed it entirely to the title. It was the [...] "Figaro" [...] touch that had fetched in the better-class bourgeoisie, which filled {{more than half of the}} twenty-sous places and three quarters of the twelve-sous seats. The lure had drawn them. Whether it was to continue to do so would depend upon the manner in which the <b>canevas</b> over which he had laboured to the glory of Binet was interpreted by the company. Of the merits of the <b>canevas</b> itself he had no doubt. The authors upon whom he had drawn for the elements of it were sound, and he had taken of their best, which he claimed to be no more than the justice due to them.|$|E
6000|$|After dinner M. Binet {{read to the}} {{assembled}} company the amended and amplified <b>canevas</b> of [...] "The Heartless Father," [...] which, acting upon the advice of M. Parvissimus, {{he had been at}} great pains to prepare. The company had few doubts as to the real authorship before he began to read; none at all when he had read. There was a verve, a grip about this story; and, what was more, those of them who knew their Moliere realized that far from approaching the original more closely, this <b>canevas</b> had drawn farther away from it. Moliere's original part--the title role--had dwindled into insignificance, to the great disgust of Polichinelle, to whom it fell. But the other parts had all been built up into importance, with the exception of Leandre, who remained as before. The two great roles were now Scaramouche, in the character of the intriguing Sbrigandini, and Pantaloon the father. There was, too, a comical part for Rhodomont, as the roaring bully hired by Polichinelle to cut Leandre into ribbons. And in view of the importance now of Scaramouche, the play had been rechristened [...] "Figaro-Scaramouche." ...|$|E
