40|$|AbstractFor hybrid merchants, {{who sell}} goods {{simultaneously}} through digital media and conventional channels, creating a price proposition {{is a major}} and controversial decision. We model the interaction between hybrid <b>merchants</b> and their <b>customers</b> {{within the context of}} an experience goods market; and we study how <b>merchants</b> and <b>customers</b> both learn from this interaction to make optimum decisions. The equilibrium solution of the proposed game shows that experience goods’ loyal customers tend to switch channels, make repeat purchases online, and avoid learning alternative value propositions. And the optimum strategy for hybrid merchants involves higher prices that rely on solid branding and knowledge of the clientele. The findings also yield important managerial implications...|$|R

40|$|E-Commerce, {{credit card}} fraud, Internet security, trusted {{computing}} Soft-products are intangible products {{that can be}} consumed without shipment, such as software, music and calling cards (calling time). The demand for soft-products on the Internet has been increasing {{for the past few}} years. At the same time, fraudulent credit card transactions have also increased. Compared to tangible products, fraudulent credit card transactions on soft-products are easier to conduct while difficult to recover. The fraudulent transaction is a major problem for e-commerce <b>merchants,</b> <b>customers,</b> and credit card issuers. In this paper, we classify the type of products sold on the Internet, and the common fraud that occurs for each type. We review some of the best existing credit card fraud prevention methods and introduce the Trusted email mechanism as a new way to prevent fraudulent transactions on soft-product. Trusted email is a custom email solution that can uniquely identify and authenticate the online customer, prevent unauthorized credit card transactions, and effectively resolve e-commerce disputes. ...|$|R

By observing the trading strategies and associations between <b>merchants,</b> <b>customers</b> and other individuals present at the market, we seek to understand reciprocity in its asymmetric aspects and the market itself as a social form. We aim to establish a dialogue with the reflections of Georg Simmel and Marcel Mauss, who in their analysis prioritize the relational dynamics of social reality. Looking into the relations of social subjects within the fair –traders, customers, public officials, among other stakeholders– we seek to glimpse the complexity of the inter-subjective process, reflecting on forms of reciprocity and gift in everyday life of the market. <br /...|$|R

50|$|On December 8, 1894, London banks {{suspended}} {{credit to}} the Commercial Bank of Newfoundland and requested payment on some of its loans. The bank was unable to meet these obligations and requested its <b>merchant</b> <b>customers</b> to repay their loans; the merchants, themselves financially strapped, were unable to comply. On October 10, known as Black Monday, the Commercial Bank closed. This caused a run by customers on the two remaining banks, the Union Bank of Newfoundland and the Savings Bank of Newfoundland. The Savings Bank was able to cash a large cheque at the Union Bank, but the Union Bank was subsequently forced to close. Neither of the two closed banks would ever reopen. This resulted in the devaluation of Newfoundland's currency, the shutdown of many businesses and widespread unemployment in the colony. Early in 1895, banks from Canada opened branches in Newfoundland to fill the void. The value of the Newfoundland dollar was set to the same value as the Canadian dollar.|$|R
