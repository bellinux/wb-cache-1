The study revolves around interviews trying to map daily mobility patterns and the usage of the car in everyday life. An important angle to daily transportation is the moment turbulence occurs on the path of the commute individuals’ have from one destination to another. We therefore wish to create an overview of the respondents' daily mobility patterns and their experience with traffic turbulence. The <b>car-free</b> <b>day</b> will cause a change in the city's infrastructure, and we find it interesting to examine the role which the car plays for the respondents' organization of their mobility habits during turbulence. What is interesting is the addictive relationship that man has acquired to the car, because of the cars’ availability in everyday life.

50|$|Car Free Day Vancouver is a {{community}}-based, volunteer-run {{event in}} Vancouver, British Columbia, which closes busy streets to car traffic and sets up day-long community festivals to promote active transportation, sustainability, and public spaces. It {{is similar to}} other <b>Car-Free</b> <b>Days</b> held around the world. It has traditionally taken place once per year on the third Sunday in June (Father's Day). In recent years it has expanded to events on both the Saturday and Sunday, {{in addition to an}} event in North Vancouver in August. The neighbourhoods involved often host smaller block parties in conjunction with a large street festival to celebrate. This day eliminates cars from the event sites along major streets and encourages people in these communities to interact with each other in the spirit of reducing carbon emissions. The larger street festivals include many non-profit organizations, artisans, artists, businesses, and food vendors. Some festivals also include live performances ranging from musical guests, to spoken word, to dance and more. The goals of these events are to remind people of their ecological impact on the city, to decrease dependence on personal vehicles as transportation within the city, to encourage active and alternative forms of transportation, and to help people see streets as public spaces for all.|$|E

Then in 2008 Hern founded Car Free Vancouver, which has spread the festival to four major Vancouver neighbourhoods, draws 250,000 people annually to call for a sustainable city with fewer cars and more community.|$|R
50|$|The Environmental Transport Association set {{the initial}} annual <b>Car-Free</b> <b>Day</b> {{on the first}} Tuesday in their Green Transport Week (around 17 June), since 2000 it was agreed {{to make it a}} self-standing day held on September 22, {{originally}} as a pan-European day organised {{under the auspices of the}} European Commission and later with international extensions—during which a large number of cities around the world are invited to close their centers to cars. Pedestrians, bicycles, public transit and other forms of sustainable transportation are encouraged on these days. People can reflect on what their city would look like with a lot fewer cars, and what might be needed to make this happen. Advocates claim that over 100 million people in 1,500 cities celebrate International <b>Car-Free</b> <b>Day,</b> though on days and in ways of their choice. This claim however is not confirmed. Over the first decade of the <b>car-free</b> <b>day</b> movement (1994-2005), the world has seen hundreds of cities giving the CFD (Car Free Day) approach a try in very different circumstances, some good, some undeniably bad, some of them on several occasions. Activists in this field wondered what were the actual accomplishments. They suggested that it was agreeable to have a pleasant day with fewer cars and probably fewer accidents at least in some parts of the city, but considered that this was not the bottom line. For them the goal of a Car Free Day had from the beginning been to serve as a small step, as a catalyst in a much larger and more ambitious process of citywide systemic transformation toward a more truly sustainable mobility system. They suggested that with rare exceptions they were not seeing anything like that. The persons involved in the movement thought that after ten years it was time to stand back and look hard to see what if any difference this approach has made. They asked themselves if CFDs made here or there had produced any significant permanent impacts on cities and the ways human beings get around in them. They wondered if they could be content with what the great bulk of these projects and programs had achieved and just keep going on as-is, or if it were not time to stand back and look again. They decided to fight complacency with a new international collaborative program starting in 2004.|$|R

Ten countermeasures currently applied for reducing greenhouse gases and air pollution materials were selected to make a scenario for evaluation. The reduction volumes of four air pollution materials(CO, HC, NOX, PM) and three greenhouse gases(CO 2, CH 4, N 2 O) for the year 2027, which is the last target year, were calculated by utilizing both a travel demand forecasting model and variable composite emission factors with respect to future travel patterns.
