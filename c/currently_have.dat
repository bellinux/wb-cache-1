5|$|Vålerenga {{has stated}} {{that they want to}} {{relocate}} and have conducted plans to build a new stadium at Valle Hovin, where the club <b>currently</b> <b>have</b> their administration and training facilities. Plans exist for stadiums for 22,000 spectators, which would be expandable to 32,000. Part of the rationale for their own stadium is that Vålerenga traditionally is the east side team, while Ullevaal is located {{in the heart of the}} west side. As an alternative, Vålerenga has considered moving back to Bislett, at least as a temporary solution.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{the stadium}} has four stands: the Tribune d'Honneur, the Tribune Pasages, the Tribune Populaire Nord, and the Tribune Populaire Sud. The four stands <b>currently</b> <b>have</b> a {{combined}} capacity of 10,898, with 1,324 of these being standing places. The stadium {{is typical of}} many continental European grounds, with an athletics track between the pitch and the stands. Next to the stadium {{there is a small}} annexed ground where the club's reserve and youth teams play their matches. The first televised match at the ground took place on 18 August 1987, when Saint-Étienne were beaten 2–1. The record attendance at the stadium was set on 24 October 1987, when 16,715 people saw Chamois Niortais defeat Marseille by two goals to one in a Division 1 encounter.|$|E
5|$|Brownhills {{does not}} <b>currently</b> <b>have</b> a Saturday men's {{football}} (soccer) team, the nearest being Pelsall Villa F.C., Heath Hayes F.C. and Walsall Wood F.C. of the Midland Football Combination. In the 1990s Brownhills Town F.C. {{competed in the}} Combination but folded during the 2003–04 season. During the 1950s Ogley Hay F.C. were a strong local team, reaching {{the final of the}} Walsall Senior Cup on three occasions. Currently, the main football club in the town is Brownhills Community Colts, a youth club which has existed since the 1970s and fields teams in various age groups, as well as teams for children with disabilities.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{richness}} of high-quality habitats in Yosemite, the brown bear, California condor, and least Bell's vireo have become extinct in the park within historical time, and another 37 species <b>currently</b> <b>have</b> special status under either California or federal endangered species legislation. The most serious current threats to Yosemite's wildlife and the ecosystems they occupy include loss of a natural fire regime, exotic species, air pollution, habitat fragmentation, and climate change. On a more local basis, factors such as road kills {{and the availability of}} human food have affected some wildlife species.|$|E
5|$|Eta Carinae A is not {{a typical}} LBV. It is more {{luminous}} than any other LBV in the Milky Way although possibly comparable to other supernova impostors detected in external galaxies. It does not currently lie on the S Doradus instability strip, although {{it is unclear what}} the temperature or spectral type of the underlying star actually is, and during its Great Eruption it was much cooler than a typical LBV outburst. The 1890 eruption may have been fairly typical of LBV eruptions, with an early F spectral type, and {{it has been estimated that}} the star may <b>currently</b> <b>have</b> an opaque stellar wind forming a pseudo-photosphere with a temperature of 9,000 K–14,000 K which would be typical for an LBV in eruption.|$|E
5|$|In the 2010–11 season, the {{aforementioned}} 2010 Seahawks won the NFC West with a 7–9 record, hosting and defeating the 11–5 New Orleans Saints. Failing {{to make the}} playoffs were the New York Giants and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, both with 10–6 records, due to losing tiebreakers for the sixth seed to the Green Bay Packers, who {{went on to become the}} first sixth-seeded team from the NFC to win the Super Bowl. The 2010 Seahawks were the first team in NFL history to win both a division championship and a playoff game with a losing regular season record. They <b>currently</b> <b>have</b> the lowest win percentage of any team to ever make the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|The Moon has an {{external}} magnetic field of about 1–100 nanoteslas, less than one-hundredth that of Earth. It does not <b>currently</b> <b>have</b> a global dipolar magnetic field and only has crustal magnetization, probably acquired early in lunar history when a dynamo was still operating. Alternatively, some of the remnant magnetization may be from transient magnetic fields generated during large impact events through the expansion of an impact-generated plasma cloud {{in the presence of}} an ambient magnetic field. This is supported by the apparent location of the largest crustal magnetizations near the antipodes of the giant impact basins.|$|E
5|$|The Okapi Conservation Project, {{established}} in 1987, works towards {{the conservation of}} the okapi {{as well as the}} growth of the indigenous Mbuti people. In November 2011, the White Oak Conservation center and Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens hosted an international meeting of the Okapi Species Survival Plan (SSP) and the Okapi European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) at Jacksonville, which was attended by representatives from zoos from the USA, Europe and Japan. The aim was to discuss the management of captive okapis and arrange support for okapi conservation. Many zoos in North America and Europe <b>currently</b> <b>have</b> okapis in captivity.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} {{population}} {{is thought to}} have once been 150,000 to 300,000, stretching in an arc across the North Pacific from northern Japan to the central Baja California Peninsula in Mexico. The fur trade that began in the 1740s reduced the sea otter's numbers to an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 members in 13 colonies. In about two-thirds of its former range, the species is at varying levels of recovery, with high population densities in some areas and threatened populations in others. Sea otters <b>currently</b> <b>have</b> stable populations in parts of the Russian east coast, Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, and California, with reports of recolonizations in Mexico and Japan. Population estimates made between 2004 and 2007 give a worldwide total of approximately 107,000 sea otters.|$|E

5|$|The {{station is}} one of the most {{recently}} built coal-fired power stations in the United Kingdom, but with a generating capacity of only 420megawatts (MW), is now one of the smallest operating. Two separate wind farm plans <b>currently</b> <b>have</b> permission to be built near the station, one for a 13 turbine wind farm near the smelter and another three turbine wind farm to the north of the station. In 2009, Alcan announced that they hope to fit the station with carbon capture and storage technology. In 2011, it was announced that the power station may be converted to burn biomass only, in a bid to avoid government legislation. In January 2016 the station was purchased by Energetický a průmyslový holding (EPH).|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 15 defunct NBA franchises. The Anderson Packers, the {{original}} Denver Nuggets, the Indianapolis Jets, the Sheboygan Red Skins, and the Waterloo Hawks {{had played in}} the NBL before joining the NBA, while the original Baltimore Bullets had played in the American Basketball League before joining the NBA. Nine of the fifteen defunct teams have played in only one NBA season. The Packers, Red Skins, and Hawks left the NBA for the National Professional Basketball League, and are the only defunct teams to have ceased to exist in a league other than the NBA. The original Bullets were the last defunct team to leave the NBA, having left during the 1954–55 season, and are the only defunct team to have won an NBA championship. The Chicago Stags, the Indianapolis Olympians, the Cleveland Rebels, the Packers, and the Red Skins qualified for the playoffs in every year they were active in the league. Among cities that have hosted defunct NBA franchises, Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, Detroit, Indianapolis, Toronto, and Washington, D.C. {{are the only ones}} to <b>currently</b> <b>have</b> an NBA team, although Providence, Rhode Island, Anderson, Indiana and Sheboygan, Wisconsin are all close to an hour away from a market with an NBA franchise.|$|E
