25|$|A <b>chair</b> <b>lift</b> {{is a type}} of aerial lift, which {{consists}} of a continuously circulating steel cable loop strung between two end terminals and usually over intermediate towers, carrying a series of chairs. They are the primary onhill transport at most ski areas, but are also found at amusement parks, various tourist attractions, and increasingly, in urban transport. James Curran, an engineer from the Union Pacific Railroad, invented and built the first <b>chair</b> <b>lift</b> in the world. Known as the Proctor Mountain Ski Lift, it was located in Sun Valley, Idaho.|$|E

25|$|For {{standing}} competitors, outrigger skis {{can be used}} in some classifications. These are {{ski poles}} with small skis on the end. They assist a skier balancing as they ski down the slopes, and in moving uphill for short distances, enabling skiers to do things like a climb a slope to get on a <b>chair</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|E
25|$|Stomp pads, {{which are}} placed between the {{bindings}} {{closer to the}} rear binding, allow the rider to better control the board with only one boot strapped in, such as when maneuvering onto a <b>chair</b> <b>lift,</b> riding a ski tow or performing a one footed trick. Whereas the upper surface of the board is smooth, the stomp pad has a textured pattern which provides grip to {{the underside of the}} boot. Stomp pads can be decorative and vary in their size, shape and the kind and number of small spikes or friction points they provide.|$|E
25|$|One {{method of}} {{learning}} to ski for LW3 competitors with cerebral palsy is the American Teaching System. They first thing skiers learn is what their equipment is, and {{how to put it}} on and take it off. Next, skiers learn about positioning their body in a standing position on flat terrain. After this, the skier learns how to side step, and then how to fall down and get back up again. The skier then learns how to do a straight run, and then is taught how to get on and off the <b>chair</b> <b>lift.</b> This is followed by learning wedge turns and weight transfers, wedge turns, wide track parallel turns, how to use ski poles, and advanced parallel turns.|$|E

25|$|In {{teaching}} skiers with cerebral palsy, {{instructors are}} encouraged to delay the introduction ski poles as skiers may overgrip them. Use of a ski bra is also encouraged as it helps the skier learn correct knee and hip placement.

500|$|At {{the grounds}} of the tower there was a large {{permanent}} funfair, with rides including Figure of Eight, Wall Of Death, Donkey Derby, The Himalayan Switchback Railway and The Caterpillar. To give easy access from the promenade entrance to the tower, a <b>chair</b> <b>lift</b> was introduced. [...] In 1898–99 an acrobat named Hardy performed for a season at the tower without a safety net and often without a balancing pole on the high wire [...] above the dancing platform. In 1908 the 'Himalaya Railway'was replaced with a scenic railway.|$|E
500|$|Squaw Valley in 1956 {{consisted}} of one <b>chair</b> <b>lift,</b> two rope tows, and a fifty-room lodge. Cushing presented the site as a blank canvas of unspoiled environment, where a world-class ski resort could be constructed. [...] The obscurity {{of the location}} was underscored at the closing ceremonies of the 1956 Winter Olympics. Traditionally {{the mayor of the}} current host city passes a flag to the mayor of the next host city signalling the transfer of the Games. Since Squaw Valley was an unincorporated village it had no city government. John Garland, an IOC member from California, was asked to stand in and received the flag from the mayor of Cortina d'Ampezzo.|$|E

2500|$|The synagogue {{is a part}} of the Frank Lloyd Wright Historic Society {{and because}} of that, the current owners cannot make changes to the {{building}} without permission from the organization. For example, the carpet, which is a beige color symbolizing the sands of the desert the Jews had to cross, cannot be changed without permission of the body. This has made updating the building for modern electricity and heating difficult, causing the main sanctuary to be very cold in winter. The only exception to the needed approval was the addition of a <b>chair</b> <b>lift</b> so that the synagogue could comply with laws promoting access for people with disabilities. [...] The floor plans of both sanctuary rooms do not allow for any additions or space changes required to accommodate members with wheel chairs.|$|E

A direct ascent from the same starting point goes west across moorland to reach the foot of Sròn na Creise, it is then a scramblers route up to the northern end of the summit ridge. The hill can also be climbed as part of the Clachlet Traverse, a 25km classic walk between the Inveroran Inn at Bridge of Orchy and the Kings House Inn in Glen Coe taking all four of the Black Mount Munros with 1700 metres of ascent.
