40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the outcome of Cohesion Policy (CP) on the {{processes}} of European Union (EU) identity building, by claiming that the context in which CP are implemented {{plays an important role in}} these processes. This topic received almost no attention in the literature, despite of its relevance in a time characterized by a persistent economic crisis, an unstable global scenario and increasing Euroscepticism. However, the impact of CP cannot be assumed to be the same across EU regions. Instead, it is mediated by a set of territorial characteristics defining different kinds of local policy implementation settings. The goal of this paper is therefore to conceptually discuss and define these features and, in the second part, to empirically <b>classify</b> <b>EU</b> areas across the alternative policy implementation settings. This analysis will allow drawing some implications on the relationship between CP and the identification of citizens with the EU values...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyse the tax burden in Croatia and to find out whether and how the size and the structure of total labour costs affect the functioning of the labour market. The tax wedge, together with employment and unemployment rates, is brought into play to <b>classify</b> <b>EU</b> countries and Croatia into clusters using K-means and hierarchical clustering. The results show that Croatia is classified among countries with a high tax wedge and a high unemployment rate. The same holds when, instead of the tax wedge, personal average tax rate is considered. However, in Croatia most of the tax burden is borne by the employees, not by the employers. Thus, the average Croatian industry worker bears a relatively high tax burden, which is exacerbated when the newly introduced “crisis tax” and increased VAT are taken into account. tax burden, tax wedge, (un) employment, cluster analysis, Croatia, EU...|$|E

40|$|Newspapers are {{typically}} categorised as being either Eurosceptic or Europhile. However, this classification is insufficient and misleading {{when applied to}} news reporting in the UK press. The term Euroscepticism has been usefully deconstructed into more nuanced and complex categories by researchers studying political parties and public opinion. A similar approach is now needed to better represent the complexities of EU news coverage. The current Eurosceptic / Europhile classification needs to be developed for two main reasons. First, it is misleading in that it fails to accurately map the landscape of EU news reporting across the press. Second, it is too simplistic in that it ignores important variations in EU news production – in particular, differences between tabloid and quality titles, and between Brussels based and national based journalists. This article will discuss these issues by drawing on new, empirical research into EU news production.

40|$|The twenty-seven Member States that {{constitute}} the European Union differ on linguistic, cultural and legal grounds. Nevertheless, one of the EU’s founding principles is multilingualism and the translation of its entire legislation in all the twenty-three official languages. Originally conceived for a four-member community, multilingualism has resisted throughout the numerous waves of EU enlargement and is today aimed at giving national Governments {{the chance to be}} equally represented. In particular, unlike other international organizations, the European Union enacts legislative measures that override national law; multilingualism is therefore also indispensable to guarantee that citizens in each Member State thoroughly understand the law in their native language in order to comply with it. Following an introductory section on multilingual legal drafting and on the difficulties related to the uniform interpretation of EU specialised concepts throughout national courts, the study concentrates on the semantic and morphosyntactic aspects that help <b>classify</b> <b>EU</b> language as a Language for Special Purposes (LSP). From a lexical perspective, the focus shifts to a diachronic analysis of the neologisms derived from Community debates, policy and legislation. Reflecting the continuous evolution of its political, economic and legislative measures, ‘Eurolanguage’ becomes a highly productive mechanism that increasingly permeates national languages through politics and the media. Terminological productivity is also constantly guaranteed by the meticulous work of EU staff translators, who exploit the inner resources of national languages and thus actively contribute to the introduction and diffusion of EU specialised terminology...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{combines}} {{analysis of}} the production of EU news with analysis of EU news texts appearing in the UK national, daily press. It identifies key forces shaping EU news production and seeks to explain how and why they influence the content of EU press coverage. Forces shaping news production are explored through interviews with Brussels correspondents, UK based journalists and EU press officials. Findings emerging from these interviews are then examined, revised and further explored {{through a combination of}} the quantitative and qualitative analysis of newspaper texts. The resulting conclusions provide a number of original and substantial contributions {{to our understanding of the}} nature and causes of EU press coverage in the UK. First, the thesis provides the most comprehensive study to date of the roles of UK based journalists in the production of EU news. It identifies a number of ways in which these under-researched subjects are crucial in shaping the nature of EU reporting. Second, the thesis provides new findings about the role of the EU Commission in influencing the coverage of EU news, being the first major study to examine recent reforms of the European Commission's communication strategies and their impacts on the way the press service operates. Third, the study produces a new framework for analysing EU news texts in UK newspapers based on the empirical study of their production. In doing so, it is able to provide new findings about some of the causes of EU news in the UK press, about which previous textual studies have only been able to speculate. Finally, this thesis offers a new means of <b>classifying</b> <b>EU</b> press coverage. It will argue that existing means are inadequate, and develop an alternative which better accounts for the complexities and characteristics of EU news production...|$|R

40|$|The lack {{of balance}} of {{national}} budgets and, in particular, {{of the social}} security budget, makes decision makers to look increasingly to the characteristics of the labour market and to the general output of economic activity. The better a country is placed in terms of the technological performance of economic activities, which favours an increased labour productivity, the higher are the values {{of the gross domestic product}} of the state's general income, and the country's possibility to afford a social policy that is more adapted to the needs of the population. Innovation performance <b>classifies</b> <b>EU</b> member states into four groups, each of these groups having almost a specific curve of the participation rates according to age and sex. In Romania, the population's activity rates according to age groups in the more developed regions are closer to those in the countries with the best innovation performance, although, as a whole, Romania is placed in the fourth and last group according to innovation results among EU member states. In our country, the activity rates according to age group have decreased in recent years, especially with respect to groups aged 50 or more, although the retirement age for men is the highest among EU countries. The increase of labour productivity has boosted economic growth in the recent past but, because of the lack of coherent economic policies, this growth has not. In Romania, activity rates for certain age groups were higher three decades ago and even in the first years of the transition to the market economy. Several scenarios for the projection of rates of participation to economic life until 2020, according to age groups are useful - and, possibly, also realistic, even if the (optimistic) scenario with the highest activity rates is taken into account. The latter could be achieved if policies are implemented which enable workforce retention in the country and a better match between the qualification level and profile and the job description...|$|R

Turkey is trying to accede to an advanced level of regional integration; both the conditions of accession are more demanding, and a possible future membership would have more serious economic and political implications. When accession is high in Turkish political agenda, emigrants might have invaluable influence on the attitude of current members whose approval is indispensable, and in particular Germany, the biggest member of the EU (Østergaard-Nielsen, 2003 d,e). Furthermore, EU membership has direct implications for citizenship; if Turkish emigrants in Germany were <b>classified</b> as <b>EU</b> citizens, they would be subject to privileged treatment for dual citizenship without the requirement of renouncing their existing nationality. In other words, the effect of Turkey’s accession to the EU on plural citizenship would be equivalent to convincing Germany to amend her nationality law.|$|R
