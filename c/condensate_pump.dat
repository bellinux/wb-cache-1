The operators decided to blow the compressed air into the water and let the force of the water clear the resin. When they forced the resin out, a small amount of water forced its way past a stuck-open check valve and found its way into an instrument air line. This would eventually cause the feedwater <b>pumps,</b> <b>condensate</b> booster <b>pumps,</b> and <b>condensate</b> <b>pumps</b> to turn off around 4:00am, which would in turn cause a turbine trip.|$|R

5000|$|A {{very common}} {{application}} is in sump <b>pumps</b> and <b>condensate</b> <b>pumps</b> where the switch detects the rising {{level of liquid}} in the sump or tank and energizes an electrical pump which then pumps liquid out until {{the level of the}} liquid has been substantially reduced, at which point the pump is switched off again.

50|$|Many {{portable}} dehumidifiers {{can also}} be adapted to connect the condensate drip output directly to a drain via a hose.

50|$|<b>Condensate</b> <b>pumps</b> usually run {{intermittently}} {{and have}} a tank in which condensate can accumulate. Eventually, the accumulating liquid raises a float switch energizing the pump. The pump then runs until the level of liquid in the tank is substantially lowered. Some pumps contain a two-stage switch. As liquid rises to the trigger point of the first stage, the pump is activated. If the liquid continues to rise (perhaps because the pump has failed or its discharge is blocked), the second stage will be triggered. This stage may switch off the HVAC equipment (preventing the production of further condensate), trigger an alarm, or both.|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of a {{conventional}} steam-electric power plant utilizing a drum boiler, the surface condenser removes the latent heat of vaporization from the steam as it changes states from vapor to liquid. The heat content (btu) in the steam is referred to as Enthalpy. The <b>condensate</b> <b>pump</b> then pumps the condensate water through a feedwater heater.

Steam and exhaust condensate is usually hot. These various factors may combine (along with local regulations) to require careful handling or even chemical treatment of the <b>condensate,</b> and <b>condensate</b> <b>pumps</b> used for these services must be appropriately designed.|$|R

50|$|Depending {{upon the}} {{selected}} chilled water temperatures {{and the relative}} humidity of the space, {{it is likely that}} the cooling coil will dehumidify the entering air stream, and as a by product of this process, it will at times produce a condensate which will need to be carried to drain.
