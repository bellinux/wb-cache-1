This was known in camp jargon as ‘dying from the dog’s kiss’. The real cause of death from a medical point of view was usually general sepsis, if the inmate didn’t die immediately of heart failure. Of the thousands of inmates that Bachmayer himself killed or tortured, just two cases are mentioned here. One day the evening roll call in block 20 didn’t tally and one inmate was missing. In block 20 the unfortunate victims of Action K were housed under special security measures ... where they were left to die of hunger. When the missing inmate was noticed, all the other inmates in the entire camp were first required to fall in and remain standing in the roll <b>call</b> <b>area.</b> At {{the same time a}} search was initiated and the missing inmate was ultimately found in one of the normal inmate blocks where he had hidden in the hope of avoiding starvation. When Bachmayer received the report that the inmate had been found, he was standing by chance next to the undersigned. He began to tremble with gleeful excitement and said half to himself ‘I’ll batter this one to death myself’, which he then proceeded to do."Gerhard Kanthack, former German government official and political prisoner at Mauthausen (AMM V/3/20) ...|$|E
40|$|Using {{systematic}} electrophysiological mapping, architectonics and {{the global}} pattern of interhemispheric connectivity, we have identified three visual areas in the lateral most part of the posterior suprasylvian gyrus. The most posterior and largest area we <b>call</b> <b>area</b> 20 a and anterior to this we defined a smaller area, area 20 b. These areas lie lateral to the visual areas 18, 19 and 21 and posterior to a third, but incompletely defined, visual area, area PS. Areas 20 a and 20 b, emphasize {{the representation of the}} upper hemifield. Their interhemispheric connections conform to the so called ‘midline rule ’ in that they are abundant in regions representing central portions of the visual field, scarce or absent elsewhere. These areas are probably homologous to the homonymous areas of the cat and might be indicative of a Bauplan from which the temporal areas of primates may have evolved...|$|E
40|$|Many {{learning}} tasks require substantial skills training. Ideally, {{the student}} might benefit {{the most from}} having a human expert – a teacher or trainer – at hand throughout, but human expertise remains a scarce resource. The second-best solution could be to do skills training with a computer-based self-training system. This vision of the computer as tutor currently motivates increasing efforts worldwide, in all manner of fields, including that of computer-assisted language learning, or CALL.

40|$|One of {{telecommunication}} {{providers in}} Indonesia applies CDMA 2000 1 x technology. The technology has many advantages such as larger channel capacity of BTS (Base Transceiver Station). On the other hand, the capacity depends on user’s density. Therefore to guarantee voice connection when user or mobile station (MS) is always {{moving from one}} cell to others, handover technique is needed. However the technique can be failed for many reasons. Therefore impact of call attempt on softer and soft handover performance is investigated. Hence the paper examined soft – softer handover performance of CDMA in BTS (Base Transceiver Station), BSC, and Sectors in both sub-urban and rural areas in Denpasar, Bali with area code of 0361. The {{research has been done}} in rural and suburban area with <b>call</b> <b>area</b> code ‘ 0361 ’. The analyses included regression and simple linear correlation applications. The results showed that number of call attempts affected the failure of soft and softer handover technique dominantly. Generally, average level of success both handover in both rural and suburban area were about 99 % which are above KPI (Key Performance Indicator) reference at 98. 50 %. However in rural area, other factors such as blocking called attempt and error called number have caused the softer handover failure...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: In Japan, {{ambulance}} staff sometimes {{must make}} request calls to find hospitals that can accept patients {{because of an}} inadequate information sharing system. This study aimed to quantify effects {{of the number of}} request calls on the time interval between an emergency call and hospital arrival. Design and setting: A cross-sectional study of an ambulance records database in Nara prefecture, Japan. Cases: A total of 43 663 patients (50 % women; 31. 2 % aged 80 years and over) : (1) transported by ambulance from April 2013 to March 2014, (2) aged 15 years and over, and (3) with suspected major illness. Primary outcome measures: The time from call to hospital arrival, defined as the time interval from receipt of an emergency call to ambulance arrival at a hospital. Results: The mean time interval from emergency call to hospital arrival was 44. 5 min, and the mean number of requests was 1. 8. Multilevel linear regression analysis showed that ∼ 43. 8 % of variations in transportation times were explained by patient age, sex, season, day of the week, time, category of suspected illness, person calling for the ambulance, emergency status at request <b>call,</b> <b>area</b> and number of request calls. A higher number of request calls was associated with longer time intervals to hospital arrival (addition of 6. 3 min per request call; p< 0. 001). In an analysis dividing areas into three groups, there were differences in transportation time for diseases needing cardiologists, neurologists, neurosurgeons and orthopaedists. Conclusions: The study revealed 6. 3 additional minutes needed in transportation time for every refusal of a request call, and also revealed disease-specific delays among specific areas. An effective system should be collaboratively established by policymakers and physicians to ensure the rapid identification of an available hospital for patient transportation {{in order to reduce the}} time from the initial emergency call to hospital arrival...|$|E
