25|$|Another {{distinctive}} {{building was}} St. Jude's Anglican Cathedral, see of the Anglican Diocese of The Arctic, {{which was a}} white building shaped like an igloo. The altar was built by the parishioners, {{under the guidance of}} Markoosie Peter, a traditional master carpenter. It was shaped like a traditional Inuit sled, and the cross composed of two crossed narwhal tusks. An incident of arson severely affected the Cathedral structure and interior on 5 November 2005, and it was demolished on 1 June 2006. The cathedral is slowly being rebuilt (foundation 2008 superstructure 2010) and fund-raising continues locally and internationally. In December 2010, the exterior of a similarly shaped replacement cathedral was completed, and interior work was planned for 2011 with a potential opening for Christmas 2011. The current building, informally referred to as the Igloo Cathedral, was opened on June 3, 2012. The unique building, in the shape of an igloo, has traditionally been a landmark and tourist attraction in Iqaluit, besides its important spiritual role for Iqalummiut (people of Iqaluit). On a ridge overlooking the city is the distinctive blue and white Inuksuk High School. The school is made up of four square sections joined together that give a <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> shape when viewed from the air.|$|E
500|$|The central castle {{is built}} from slatestone rubble, with granite {{features}} and detailing; {{it has a}} <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> design with a central, four-storey circular tower, or keep, at its core, and three circular bastions emerging from it. The design allowed for multiple levels of artillery, {{and may have been}} influenced by the contemporary work of the Moravian engineer, Stefan von Haschenperg, on some of the other Device Forts constructed during this period. It had little protection to the landward side, and would have depended upon the local militia providing protection against such an attack. The castle has been little altered since its original construction, and the historian Paul Pattison considers it to be [...] "arguably the most perfect survivor of all Henry's forts".|$|E
500|$|The <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> shaped castle, with an {{additional}} small blockhouse at the water's edge below, was armed with 19 artillery pieces - a demi-cannon, a demi-culverin, a demi-sling, five slings, four portpieces and seven bases - along with 12 large hagbusshes, a form of arquebus. The artillery was originally mounted in the castle's stone bastions and was intended as [...] "ship-sinking" [...] weapons for use against enemy vessels. A smaller blockhouse was constructed beneath the main castle, at sea level; {{this may have been}} constructed ahead of the main castle build as a form of early protection. Normally the castle would have held a small garrison, which would have been supplemented by the local militia {{in the event of a}} crisis; St Mawes had 18 billhooks and 30 bows in its stores, probably for the use of the militia in such a situation.|$|E

500|$|St Mawes Castle (...) is an {{artillery}} fort constructed by Henry VIII near Falmouth, Cornwall, between 1540 and 1542. It formed {{part of the}} King's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended the Carrick Roads waterway {{at the mouth of}} the River Fal. The castle was built under the direction of Thomas Treffry to a <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> design, with a four-storey central tower and three protruding, round bastions that formed gun platforms. It was initially armed with 19 artillery pieces, intended for use against enemy shipping, operating in partnership with its sister castle of Pendennis on the other side of the estuary. During the English Civil War, St Mawes was held by Royalist supporters of King Charles I, but surrendered to a Parliamentary army in 1646 in the final phase of the conflict.|$|E
500|$|The TD absorbed its subsidiary, the Toledo, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railroad (TC), in March 1882, {{and took}} its name as more {{descriptive}} {{of the growing}} system, which hoped {{to become part of}} a nationwide narrow gauge network stretching southwest to Mexico City. One year later, in May 1883, the Cincinnati Northern and the SGA were consolidated into the TC However, the TC was constructed cheaply, with poor drainage and little ballast. While the Cincinnati Northern had been built to better standards, the connecting line between Lebanon Junction and Dodds was just as bad. The inadequate facilities and equipment, as well as difficulties in interchanging equipment with [...] lines, contributed to its entering receivership in August 1883. [...] The TC had six divisions at this time. [...] Four of the five TC divisions south of Delphos were sold to their bondholders at auction in June 1884, and separate companies were soon organized for three of those: the Dayton and Toledo Railroad, Dayton and Ironton Railroad, and Iron Railway (named Iron Railroad prior to TC receivership). [...] The Toledo-St. Louis line was sold in December 1885 and reorganized as the Toledo, St. Louis and Kansas City Railroad, commonly known as the <b>Clover</b> <b>Leaf</b> Route. [...] In July, George Hafer of Avondale replaced William J. Craig of Toledo as receiver of the Cincinnati Northern Division, allowing it to recover from Craig's deferred maintenance. Hafer obtained a short-term lease from the trustees of the Dodds-Lebanon Junction line (officially the Cincinnati Division), allowing continued access to Dayton. Finally, on June 27, 1885, the Cincinnati Northern Division was sold for $200,000 to its bondholders, who incorporated the Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railway, with Hafer as president, on July 14 and transferred operations on August 1, 1885. The narrow gauge movement of the 1870s had failed, and all of the ex-TC lines were converted to standard gauge within the next ten years.|$|E
