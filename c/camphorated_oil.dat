25|$|Starting in 1918, Dr. Cadbury treated lepers, {{who were}} outpatients in the Canton Hospital leprosy clinic, for one year. The Canton Hospital {{was the first}} to have an {{organized}} leprosy clinic in China. He injected these patients with a mixture of chaulmoogra oil, resorcin, and <b>camphorated</b> <b>oil.</b> Then, he reported the results in The China Medical Journal in 1920. He wrote:"We must state that the various remedies, as outlined above, while in most cases of leprosy they have definite therapeutic value, yet unless the patients are cared for in a sanatorium, given proper food, together with baths and attention to personal hygiene, a complete cure can hardly be looked for."In 1926, Dr. Cadbury tackled widespread issue of Chinese children not knowing their birth dates. He collected information from 1013 Cantonese children. His calculations to estimate the ages of these children revealed an understanding of the customs of the Canton people. For example, he learned that most of the children claimed they were born in August, September, and October most likely due to the tradition that Canton merchants were gone for most of the year except around Chinese New Year.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, the US Food and Drug Administration set a {{limit of}} 11% {{allowable}} camphor in consumer products, and banned products labeled as <b>camphorated</b> <b>oil,</b> camphor oil, camphor liniment, and camphorated liniment (except [...] "white camphor essential oil", which contains no significant amount of camphor). Since alternative treatments exist, medicinal use of camphor is discouraged by the FDA, except for skin-related uses, such as medicated powders, which contain only small amounts of camphor.|$|E
60|$|Quickly he {{uncovered}} the blond lower {{body of his}} patient, and began to rub the abdomen with oil, using a slow, rhythmic, circulating motion, a sort of massage. For a long time he rubbed finely and steadily, then went over {{the whole of the}} lower body, mindless, as if in a sort of incantation. He rubbed every speck of the man's lower body--the abdomen, the buttocks, the thighs and knees, down to the feet, rubbed it all warm and glowing with <b>camphorated</b> <b>oil,</b> every bit of it, chafing the toes swiftly, till he was almost exhausted. Then Aaron was covered up again, and Lilly sat down in fatigue to look at his patient.|$|E

40|$|Camphor is a volatile, {{aromatic}} compound familiar {{to many people}} as a principal ingredient in topical home remedies for colds. It is highly toxic when ingested. Although <b>camphorated</b> <b>oil</b> in concentrations of 11 % or greater is not longer sold in the United States, preparations containing concentrations of up to 20 % are still sold over the counter in Canada. The authors describe two children who suffered severe poisoning after accidental ingestion of {{a small amount of}} <b>camphorated</b> <b>oil.</b> Both children exhibited generalized tonic-clonic seizures with subsequent respiratory depression. Treatment was symptomatic, consisting of seizure control and respiratory assistance. The authors argue that because <b>camphorated</b> <b>oil</b> is of questionable benefit and poses a danger to the public it should be removed from the market...|$|E
