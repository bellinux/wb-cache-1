The <b>chilled</b> <b>meat</b> was retailed through special warehouses and stores. There was concern in Britain that chilled American meat might flood the market and harm domestic farmers, but the exports continued. The rival Chicago-based meat firms of Armour and Swift entered the refrigerated meat transport market in the late 1870, establishing their own fleet of refrigerator cars, network of icing stations and other infrastructure, increasing the sales of chilled Chicago beef to the eastern seaboard from 15,680 tons (14,128,000kg) a year in 1880, to 173,067 tons (155,933,000kg) in 1884.|$|E
5|$|By 1904 {{the line}} was {{operating}} fourteen steamships of between four and seven thousand tons, several built by the associated Furness Withy shipyards. Services to ports in eastern Canada were supplemented by regular sailings to Boston, Philadelphia, and the southern US cotton ports of New Orleans and Galveston. Between 1904 and 1908 ML deployed three vessels including the Manchester City to the River Plate route, serving other UK ports as well Manchester. The main return cargo was frozen and <b>chilled</b> <b>meat,</b> and the City set a record for the largest meat consignment up to that time. Lord Furness, as he had become, died in 1912 and was succeeded as ML's chairman by R. B. Stoker {{until his death in}} 1919. ML's fleet was maintained at 14vessels during the last few years before the First World War. Eleven of their ships were deployed on the Canadian routes, carrying mainly manufactured goods outwards and meat and grain inbound.|$|E
5|$|By the 1860s, natural ice was {{increasingly}} {{being used to}} move western American products to the east, starting with <b>chilled</b> <b>meat</b> from Chicago. There was some initial opposition, both from the cattle-car owners and from eastern butchers, who stood to lose out from the trade; by the 1870s, however, multiple shipments were leaving for the east each day. Chilled butter from the mid-West was then shipped onwards from New York to Europe, and by the 1870s 15 percent of the United Kingdom's butter consumption was being met in this way. A chain of icing stations at Chicago, Omaha, Utah and Sierra Nevada allowed railroad refrigerator cars to cross the continent. The ability of ice companies to ship their product by rail from the east proved the final straw for the Alaskan ice trade, which collapsed during the 1870s and 1880s {{in the face of}} the competition, destroying the local saw-mill industry in the process.|$|E

Anecdotal evidence suggests SPAM®(luncheon meat) is a local favorite, and Hawai‘i has been cited often as the SPAM® {{capital of the world}} for its high per capita consumption. Fresh milk consumption has been historically lower as many residents in the local community avoid lactose in dairy milk.|$|R

5|$|Refrigerated {{ships were}} also made {{possible}} {{through the ice}} trade, allowing perishable goods to be exported internationally, first from the U.S. and then from countries such as Argentina and Australia. Early ships had stored their chilled goods along with the main cargo of ice; the first ships to transport <b>chilled</b> <b>meat</b> to Britain, designed by Bate, adapted the railroad refrigerator cars, using ice {{at either end of}} the hold and a ventilation fan to keep the meat cool. An improved version, invented by James Craven, piped a brine solution through the ice and then the hold to keep the meat cool, and created a drier atmosphere in the hold, preserving the meat better. Natural ice was also used in fishing industries to preserve catches, initially in the eastern American fisheries. In 1858 the Grimsby fishing fleet began to take ice out to sea with them to preserve their catches; this allowed longer journeys and bigger catches, and the fishing industry became the biggest single user of ice in Britain.|$|E

Ozone {{has a strong}} oxidizing nature {{that makes it a}} useful tool for the inactivation of microorganisms. Aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of an experimental ozone gaseous treatment and production of the biogenic amines putrescine and cadaverine, as freshness index, during the storage of chilled poultry carcasses. Amines were extracted with perchloric acid, derivative with dansyl chloride, separated using a reversed- phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method, and detected by fluorescence. The results showed a reduction of microbial contamination as effect of the experimental ozone treatment of carcasses. In simply <b>chilled</b> poultry <b>meat</b> (Lot C control) a significant increases of putrescine and cadaverine at 15 th days of storage. At 20 t day higher levels of putrescine (53, 63 mg/kg) and cadaverine (175, 20 mg/kg) occurred in Lot C than in treated poultry meat of Lot A. Ozone decontamination resulted in lower levels of putrescine (32, 37 mg/kg) and cadaverine (132, 30 mg/kg), and in Lot A the shelf life was 6 days longer than in Lot C. If authorized, an ozone treatment during the storage of <b>chilled</b> poultry <b>meat</b> can induce a reduction of microbial contamination. Putrescine and cadaverine levels appeared to be useful to control the effectiveness of the ozone treatment on meat quality, and may be useful as quality index to highlight the loss of poultry meat freshness, before sensorial meat changes during storage of <b>chilled</b> poultry <b>meat...</b>|$|R

40|$|An o-Tyrosine {{method for}} {{detection}} of irradiation of foods was studied by HPLC using a novel light am-plification by stimulated emission of radiation (LA-SER) fluorometric detection system with pre-column reaction. Sample was prepared and purified by elimi-nating fat and sugars using a mixture of acetone and chloroform, and then the purified protein was hydro-lyzed using hydrochloric acid at 110 °C for 24 h in a vacuum. The sample was reacted with 4 -fluoro- 7 -nitrobenzofurazan (NBD-F) reagent by an automatic pipetting system and was introduced into the HPLC system. Irradiated chicken, pork, beef, and tuna were examined by irradiating at 0, 1, 5, 10 kGy. Irradia-tion of chicken and pork irradiated at or over 10 kGy was successfully detected, but that of beef and tuna were more difficult to detect.

40|$|The most {{difficult}} to control segment that affects directly safety and quality of <b>chilled</b> <b>meats</b> is the actual chill chain. Application of an optimised management for chilled distribution requires continuous monitoring and control of storage conditions from production to consumption. A novel chill chain management policy, coded “Safety Monitoring and Assurance System ” (SMAS) is applied, allowing to give priority to products {{in such a way}} that, compared to the First In First Out (FIFO) current approach, risk at consumption time is minimized and quality optimised. The principles of the SMAS management approach of chilled products are developed and implemented, in order to prove the benefits of this system against the traditional FIFO. The two alternative policies (FIFO and SMAS) were compared for their effect {{on the quality of the}} products in terms of remaining shelf life, as well as for the impact on the microbiological risk at the time of consumption.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model for the}} semi-batch operation of tray tunnels for food deep chilling is presented and analyzed. Design aspects are discussed involving both single tunnels and systems of parallel tunnels. In both cases, optimum flowsheet configuration and operating conditions are sought and verified by appropriate formulation of design and optimization strategies. The optimization objective is the total annual cost of the plant, subject to constraints imposed by {{the operation of the}} chilling tunnel, thermodynamics and construction. The decision variables were the number of trucks, the operating temperature and flowrate of the cooling air stream, the refrigeration cycle heat exchanger temperature, as well as the total number of sections involved. The Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) nature of the design problem required mathematical programming techniques for its solution. The optimization was carried out {{for a wide range of}} production capacities, and the optimal points, where a new truck or a new section is introduced, were evaluated.
