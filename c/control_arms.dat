5|$|Offered with an inline-4 {{engine and}} bucket seats the Pinto's {{mechanical}} design was conventional, with unibody construction, a {{longitudinally mounted engine}} in front driving the rear wheels through either a manual or automatic transmission and live axle rear end. Suspension was by unequal-length <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> with front coil springs; the live rear axle was suspended on leaf springs. The {{rack and pinion steering}} had optional power assist, as did the brakes.|$|E
25|$|The leaf-spring {{suspension}} configuration is independent, {{because the}} movement of one wheel is not determined by {{the position of the}} other. <b>Control</b> <b>arms</b> are utilized to define the motion of the wheel as the suspension is compressed. The usual coil springs are replaced with a single FRP spring, which spans the width of the car. As in independent suspension systems using coil springs, and unlike the common leaf-spring supported Hotchkiss rear axle, the suspension kinematics are defined only by the <b>control</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|E
25|$|The front {{suspension}} {{consisted of}} unequal length <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> with torsion bars, while the rear suspension used a live axle supported by asymmetric leaf springs. Chrysler used this design {{through the entire}} production of the Valiant and other A-body models, with revisions to the suspension components themselves for the 1962, 1967, 1968, and 1973 models.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Suspension {{system is}} major {{part in a}} vehicle, the {{wishbone}} upper <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> {{is a type of}} a independent suspension used in passenger car. In this work it is mainly concentrated on stiffness, slippage and damage of upper <b>control</b> <b>arm.</b> The upper <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> is subjected to different type of loads such as static loads and cyclic loads. Stiffness is improved by changing shape and size of upper <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> this is achieved by static analysis. This analysis is carried out to find displacement, stress and stiffness. Due to some loading conditions, slippage occurs in between arm and bush. In this work slippage analysis carried out to check whether slippage occurs in the upper <b>control</b> <b>arm.</b> Fatigue analysis carried out to determine the damage and life of upper <b>control</b> <b>arm...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{fuel control}} system {{responsive}} to a power controller and controlling a fuel delivery system. The fuel control system includes a <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> connected {{to both the}} power controller and the fuel delivery system, a position sensor connected to the <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> and a trim controller connected to the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> at a pivot point and connected to the position sensor...|$|R
25|$|Braking duties were {{handled by}} 11.3-inch discs {{up front and}} drums in the rear. Power assist was standard. The front {{suspension}} consisted of unequal-length <b>control</b> <b>arms,</b> coil springs, adjustable tube arms, and an anti-sway bar. Out back was a live axle, with multi-leaf, semi-elliptical springs and tube shocks. The steering was a power-assisted recirculating ball design.|$|E
25|$|The 1970 VAM Javelins {{received}} a new front suspension design with dual <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> and ball joints. Units with four-speed manual transmissions incorporated a Hurst linkage as factory-installed equipment, which was previously available {{only with the}} optional Go Pack package and separately in certain dealerships. A mid-year change replaced the imported Borg-Warner T10 manual transmission {{in favor of the}} Querétaro-produced TREMEC 170-F four-speed model to comply with the percentages of both local and imported equipment mandated by law.|$|E
25|$|This {{calculation}} is not {{commonly used}} to get the outer diameter for a regular vehicle. Though, the truck builders and off-road fans use it {{to find out the}} right wheel diameter, that will fit right into the wheel wells. For the US vehicles, the wheel wells capacity is measured in inches, so when the outer tire diameter is calculated, it is normally compared with the wheel well index. This is done in order to prevent tire from rubbing against <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> and fenders.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Reverse {{modeling}} of vehicle suspension <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> is studied. Firstly, {{the data of}} vehicle suspension <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> is acquired. Secondly, the scanning point cloud data is processed. Then 3 D model of vehicle suspension <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> is reconstructed. Finally, model’s deviation is analyzed {{to find out the}} deficiencies and to improve the accuracy of the model. Reverse modeling based on CATIA can make up the shortage of traditional modeling method and solve the problem of gaining the data of complex curved surface parts. It also can shorten the innovation and improvement cycle of the vehicle suspension <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> and reduce the production cost and enhance enterprise competitiveness...|$|R
50|$|A <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> {{may be used}} {{to carry}} the {{suspension}} load and transmit them to the spring or shock absorber. Torsion bar suspension commonly does this, with the outboard end of the torsion bar attached to the inboard bearing of the <b>control</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|R
50|$|All late model M3s {{received}} subframe re-inforcements {{and more}} aggressive front end suspension geometry {{due to the}} differences in caster and camber yielded by top hat design and lower <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> bushings. Additionally, front spring rate was increased in addition to spindle and <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> geometry changes.|$|R
25|$|Newly {{available}} for the Mustang GT for 2010 were two performance packages. The 3.73 Axle Package featured higher performance front brake pads, a more aggressive 3.73:1 rear axle, and a recalibrated AdvanceTrac system. The Track Package featured higher performance front and rear brake pads, stabilizer bars and rear lower <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> from the GT500, uniquely tuned shocks and struts, Pirelli summer tires (includes automatic upgrade to 19-inch wheels), a 3.73:1 rear axle with carbon plates in the differential, and a recalibrated AdvanceTrac system.|$|E
25|$|The XM, {{released}} in 1964, {{was the first}} Falcon with an Australian-designed body; the rear taillights were raised for Australian conditions and the front end received a full-wrap chrome grill and surrounds. The steering linkage was upgraded with 9/16-inch tie rods instead of the 1/2-inch tie rods found in the US models. The suspension was also improved with the upper <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> lowered to reduce the notorious bump steer found in the North American Falcon (and early Mustangs), on which this model was based.|$|E
25|$|The front {{suspension}} {{is short}} and long <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> with coil springs; the rear suspension is a four-link design with coil springs. A torque-arm design rear suspension replaced the four-link design starting with the 1976 models. The Astre is a rear wheel drive vehicle with a live rear axle. Steering is of a recirculating ball type with a power assist option. The brake system features front disc brakes with solid rotors, and rear drum brakes. Power assist was optional starting in the 1975 model year.|$|E

30|$|Guideline-based {{medication}} regimens {{which included}} statin therapy were reportedly used at baseline, during the trial, or throughout follow-up, in 24 (34 %) of the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> comparisons. In a further seven comparisons (10 %), statin therapy was not explicitly reported but probable given {{the dates of}} participant recruitment. Lipid-lowering therapy was either not begun in the <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> or reported as not used, in 17 comparisons (24 %) and was unlikely used in a further 24 comparisons with recruitment and follow-up periods preceding 1994. Overall, this resulted in statin use in the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> (matched with comparable use in the intervention arm) for 40 % of comparisons, 56 % of comparisons without statin use in either arm and three trials [46, 48, 60] in which the intervention arm included a specific pharmacological lipid-lowering strategy compared to the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> (Table  1).|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the vehicle chassis {{structure}} durability, the fatigue analysis and optimization design of the low <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> (LCA) was taken. A finite element model was established. By using this model, the stress distribution and lowest point of lifetime of the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> under fatigue load was calculated. Based {{on the results of}} analysis, the optimization scheme according to the structure characteristics of components was presented, and a solution to improve the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> fatigue life was given out. The research provided reference for engineering application of calculation and optimization of chassis components fatigue life...|$|R
25|$|The G35 sedan {{underwent}} a major revision for the 2007 model year. This 2nd generation front-mid (FM) platform underpinning the new G is shared {{in part with}} the Infiniti M and has several structural reinforcements around the engine and rear floor area, along with three times more laser welding and 16 percent more spot welds than the old version; overall body stiffness was improved by 40 percent. Single-pivot lower <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> in front replace the 1st gen model's twin lower links. The G35x sedan uses an ATTESA E-TS all-wheel drive system.|$|E
25|$|The Fairlane/Torino {{continued}} to be constructed with unit-construction like the 1967 models. The new car {{continued to}} use the same suspension as 1967 models, which was coil springs pivot mounted on an upper control arm and a strut stabilized lower <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> in front, with long semi-elliptical leaf springs on a solid axle in rear. A heavy-duty suspension option was available for V8 powered cars, and included extra-heavy-duty springs and shocks. Steering was recirculating ball system, with power steering optional. All cars came standard with four-wheel drum brakes, although front disc brakes and power assist were options.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 the Matiz {{received}} substantial modifications (M200), previewed by the Chevrolet M3X {{concept car}} shown at 2004 Paris Motor Show. The upper body was significantly revised based again on a design from Italdesign Giugiaro, the S-Tec engines were updated and the car's drag coefficient was lowered, resulting in better fuel economy. The interior was also significantly revised, one notable {{feature of this}} car being its centre-mounted instrument cluster. The platform was also revised, with a twist-beam rear suspension system replacing the previous 3-link beam axle, and the front suspension making use of cast, rather than pressed and fabricated, lower <b>control</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This study {{proposes a}} {{structural}} design method {{for the upper}} <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> installed at the rear side of a SUV. The weight of <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> can be reduced by applying the design and material technologies. In this research, the former includes optimization technology, and the latter the technologies for selecting aluminum as a steel-substitute material. Strength assessment {{is the most important}} design criterion in the structural design of a <b>control</b> <b>arm.</b> At the proto design stage of a new <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> FE (finite element) analysis is often utilized to predict its strength. This study considers the static strength in the optimization process. The inertia relief method for FE analysis is utilized to simulate the static loading conditions. According to the classification of structural optimization, the structural design of a <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> is included in the category of shape optimization. In this study, the kriging interpolation method is adopted to obtain the minimum weight satisfying the strength constraint. Optimum designs are obtained by ANSYS WORKBENCH and the in-house program, EXCEL-kriging program. The optimum results determined from the in-house program are compared with those of ANSYS WORKBENCH...|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of ball joints {{top and bottom}} allowed 3-axis articulation and so removed all the constraints on the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> axes being exactly parallel, so caster could be freely adjusted, typically by asymmetric adjustment {{of the position of}} the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> inner pivots, while camber was adjusted by the symmetric adjustment of these same pivots.|$|R

25|$|An entirely fresh {{approach}} was also taken by AMC engineers with the Pacer's front suspension and engine mounting. It {{was the first}} U.S. small car to isolate the engine and suspension system noises from the passenger compartment. The entire front suspension was mounted on a crossmember isolated from the frame extensions by heavy rubber bushings. It is also different from all other AMC cars with the coil spring between the two <b>control</b> <b>arms,</b> seated on the lower wishbone arm {{at the bottom and}} in the suspension/engine mount crossmember at the top. The rear suspension was also isolated, requiring a special tool to press the one-piece bushings {{in and out of the}} mounting brackets.|$|E
25|$|Steering angles {{are also}} crucial {{as the driver}} progresses. The first stage of these {{modifications}} is usually a modified steering knuckle or upright. Extended <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> can be employed on MacPherson strut vehicles like the Nissan S-Chassis, as to allow for more clearance for higher steering angles. Companies like Wisefab, IRP (Individual Racing Parts), Voodoo13, and Parts Shop MAX have developed full lock kits including modification of the vehicle's original scrub radius, kingpin axis, Ackermann angle, amount of bump steer, caster angle, and kinematics as to maximize front grip and eliminate mechanical bind at steering angles in excess of 60°. While MacPherson strut vehicles are prevalent in profession drifting, Double wishbone suspension vehicles can also be competitive, with often better caster and camber curves.|$|E
25|$|The {{independent}} {{rear suspension}} Duntov created for Sting Ray was essentially a frame-mounted differential with U-jointed half-shafts tied together by a transverse leaf spring – a design derived from the CERV I concept. Rubber-cushioned struts carried the differential, which reduced ride harshness while improving tire adhesion, especially on rougher roads. The transverse spring was bolted {{to the rear of}} the differential case. A control arm extended laterally and slightly forward from each side of the case to a hub carrier, with a trailing radius rod mounted behind it. The half-shafts functioned like upper <b>control</b> <b>arms.</b> The lower arms controlled vertical wheel motion, while the trailing rods took care of fore/aft wheel motion and transferred braking torque to the frame. Shock absorbers were conventional twin-tube units. Considerably lighter than the old solid axle, the new rear suspension array delivered a significant reduction in unsprung weight, which was important since the 1963 model would retain the previous generation's outboard rear brakes. The new model's front suspension would be much as before, with unequal-length upper and lower A-arms on coil springs concentric with the shocks, plus a standard anti-roll bar. Steering remained the conventional recirculating-ball steering design, but it was geared at a higher 19.6:1 overall ratio (previously 21.0:1). Bolted to the frame rail at one end and to the relay rod at the other was a new hydraulic steering damper (essentially a shock absorber), which helped soak up bumps before they reached the steering wheel. What's more, hydraulically assisted steering would be offered as optional equipment for the first time on a Corvette – except on cars with the two most powerful engines – and offer a faster 17.1:1 ratio, which reduced lock-to-lock turns from 3.4 to just 2.9.|$|E
40|$|The Lower <b>Control</b> <b>arm</b> is {{the most}} vital {{component}} in a suspension system. It is usually a steel bracket that pivots on rubber bushings mounted to the chassis. The other end supports the lower ball joint. Significant amount of loads are transmitted through the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> while it serves to maintain the contact between the wheel and the road and thus providing precise control of the vehicle. The finite element analysis of the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> using NEiNASTRAN is presented. Inertia relief analysis was carried out as the measured road loads were in self equilibrium. The zone of maximum stress {{in most of the}} load cases studied is close to the left strut bush and around the lower ball joint bush. Since the stresses exceed the material yield strength, a nonlinear static analysis of the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> was also carried out using NEiNASTRAN and the results are compared well with MSC. NASTRAN and ABAQUS analysis. Multi-axial Fatigue analysis using NEiNASTRAN and WINLIFE is discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{a change in}} tumour characteristics and applied treatments over time in the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> of all centres of the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and to compare this with similar data of the screening arm. Methods: Between 1993 and 2003, 182, 160 men, aged 50 - 74 years, were randomised to the screening arm (N = 82, 816) and the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> (N = 99, 184). Men in the screening arm were offered Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) testing every 4 years whilst men in the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> received usual care. Tumour characteristics and treatment were evaluated in all men diagnosed with prostate cancer up to December 2006 or the third screening round. Data on the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> were divided into 3 periods: 1994 - 1998, 1999 - 2002 and 2003 - 2006. Results: Tumour characteristics were more favourable over time in both the control and the screening arm, with especially increasing proportions of T 1 C tumours with 29 % in 1994 - 1998 versus 50 % in 2003 - 2006 and 48 % at the initial screening round versus 75 % at the third screening round, respectively. Tumour characteristics observed in the last period of the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> were comparable to tumour characteristics in the initial screening round. In the <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> treatment changed over time with surgery as the most common treatment in the entire observed period, but almost doubling of expectant management and the combination of hormone therapy and radiotherapy over time. In the initial screening round, surgery {{was the most common}} treatment (42 %), changing over time to expectant management as the most frequently applied treatment in the third screening round (33 %). Conclusion: Tumour characteristics in the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> became more favourable over time and show similarity with prostate cancer cases detected at the initial screening round. The most prominent change in treatment over time was an increase of application of expectant management in both arms of the ERSPC. These observations reflect an increasing rate of opportunistic testing over time in men randomised to the <b>control</b> <b>arm...</b>|$|R
