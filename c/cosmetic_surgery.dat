5|$|Alfie Karmal, {{the son of}} a Palestinian {{father and}} Greek mother, was ten years older than Mills when they met in 1986. Karmal bought her new clothes and Cartier jewellery, and paid for <b>cosmetic</b> <b>surgery</b> to her breasts. Karmal, who had moved into the {{computer}} industry, set up a model agency for her, ExSell Management, although it was not successful.

5|$|Michael Jackson (August 29, 1958 â€“ June 25, 2009) was an American {{singer who}} spent over four {{decades in the}} public eye, first as a child star with The Jackson 5, and later as a solo artist, during which time he went through various image changes. Starting in the mid-1980s, {{it became clear that}} Jackson's {{appearance}} was changing dramatically. The shape of his face, particularly his nose, triggered widespread speculation of extensive <b>cosmetic</b> <b>surgery.</b> His skin tone became much lighter. Although Jackson, a black man, was diagnosed with the skin disorder vitiligo, which results in white patches on the skin, and said that he had not purposely bleached his skin but had used makeup to even out his skin tone, it was also widely suggested that his lighter skin tone was partly due to skin bleaching.|$|E
40|$|We study chirally <b>cosmetic</b> <b>{{surgeries}},</b> that is, {{a pair of}} Dehn surgeries on a knot producing homeomorphic 3 -manifolds with opposite orientations. Several {{constraints on}} knots and surgery slopes to admit such surgeries are given. Our main ingredients are the original and the SL(2,C) version of Casson invariants. As applications, we discuss non-existence for chirally <b>cosmetic</b> <b>surgeries</b> on almost positive knots, and we give a complete classification of chirally <b>cosmetic</b> <b>surgeries</b> on two bridge knots of genus one.

5|$|Lauren Fenmore Baldwin (Tracey E. Bregman) {{gave birth}} to Fenmore prematurely, and {{he was forced to}} remain in the {{hospital}} for a short time. Shortly after his birth, he was kidnapped, along with Phyllis Summers Newman (Michelle Stafford) and her daughter, Summer Newman, by Sheila Carter, who had had <b>cosmetic</b> <b>surgery</b> to look like Phyllis. All are rescued when Lauren tracked down Sheila and shot her. In 2012, Fenmore was sent to stay with his half-brother, Scotty Grainger, in Canada due to Lauren's fear that Daisy Carter (Yvonne Zima), Sheila's daughter, would end up harming him. Months later, Fenmore returns a moody teenager, kindling a friendship with a teenaged Summer. They became close and later began a relationship. When Summer began harassing a boy named Jamie Vernon (Daniel Polo) online, Fenmore was against the idea, but when his father, Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc), began looking out for Jamie, he became jealous and took over the bullying by sending him harassing text messages from a disposable cell phone. Fenmore's jealously continued when Michael and Lauren had Jamie move in with them temporarily. He attempted to frame Jamie for stealing his mother's expensive decoration, and attempted to take pictures of him with the decoration on a rooftop. The boys struggled and Jamie was found face down in the snow below. He accused Fenmore of pushing him, Michael believed Jamie over his own son and he was arrested. However, Jamie later confessed that Fenmore did not push him and he was exonerated. Michael and Lauren's marriage suffered due to the bullying ordeal.|$|E

40|$|The swedish {{law against}} female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM) prohibits procedures that removes {{parts of the}} female genitalia and thereby makes permanent changes in the body. The problem with {{the wording of the}} law is that it may also apply to the western phenomenon <b>cosmetic</b> genital <b>surgery.</b> This paper therefore examines if <b>cosmetic</b> genital <b>surgery</b> should be covered by the swedish law against FGM, by making a critical comparing analysis. The paper begins with comparing FGM with <b>cosmetic</b> genital <b>surgery</b> to prove that there are more similarities than differences between the procedures. By using the theoretical perspectives universalism and postcolonialism, the paper then examines why, particularly in the West, there is a different approach to FGM than to <b>cosmetic</b> genital <b>surgery,</b> regardless of the similarities of the procedures. Further the paper also examines consent and why consent to FGM is seen as illegitimate while consent to <b>cosmetic</b> genital <b>surgery</b> is seen as legitimate. On basis of the critical comparing analysis the paper then argues: that the procedures <b>cosmetic</b> genital <b>surgery</b> and FGM are very much alike; that <b>cosmetic</b> genital <b>surgery</b> is accepted over FGM because it is more familiar in the West and; that consent should be as illegitimate when given to <b>cosmetic</b> genital <b>surgery</b> as when given to FGM. Thus the conclusion of the paper is that <b>cosmetic</b> genital <b>surgery</b> should be covered by the swedish law against FGM. ...|$|R
