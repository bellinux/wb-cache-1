40|$|This paper investigates realism in <b>character</b> <b>computer</b> animation, which {{triggered}} {{the development of}} new techniques and aesthetic in spectacular cinema and contemporary culture. With the advent of motion or performing capture, animation has made possible that virtual characters or digital creatures reach higher levels in emotional acting, taking place in virtual cinematic worlds or even special effects movies. This technology, when placed at the service of imagination and fantasy can provide new dimensions in character motion and communication. In this context, projects like Peter Jackson’s (2001) The Lord of the Rings, James Cameron’s Avatar (2009) and more recently Steven Spielberg’s Tintin (2011) demonstrate that motion technology is constantly evolving, and it represents a credible option to explore new techniques and aesthetic in contemporary animation...|$|E
40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{the present}} state of Russian anthroponymical system. The author examines central units of anthroponomical system – personal and patronymic names – as well as peripheral units such as pseudonyms, personal and computer nicknames. Changes in the active vocabulary of personal names, stability or nonstability of the normative patterns of name-giving, correlations within functional types of personal names are in the focus of the discussion. The author comes to the conclusion that Russian anthroponymical system has not changed much. At the same time the active vocabulary of personal names has reduced and there is a frequency-changing process within personal names which does not affect the whole spectrum of names. Nicknames and pseudonyms are supplementary means of name-giving for humanbeings, they realize the distinctive and social functions of the name. Nowadays nicknames and pseudonyms assume a special cultural <b>character.</b> <b>Computer</b> nicknames as a new phenomenon point out the expanding and complicated process in the periphery of the anthroponymical system. The author points out that the peripheral changes demonstrate that the anthroponymical system tends to overcome the stagnation of its core and get the functional balance...|$|E
40|$|The University of Bedfordshire in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyThis work will give a wide survey for various techniques that {{are present in the}} field of <b>character</b> <b>computer</b> animation, which concentrates particularly on those techniques and problems involved in the production of realistic character synthesis and motion. A preliminary user study (including Questionnaire, online publishing such as flicker. com, interview, multiple choice questions, publishing on Android mobile phone, and questionnaire analysis, validation, statistical evaluation, design steps and Character Animation Observation) was conducted to explore design questions, identify users' needs, and obtain a "true story" of quality character animation and the effect of using animation as useful tools in Education. The first set of questionnaires were designed to accommodate the evaluation of animation from candidates from different walks of life, ranging from animators, gamers, teacher assistances (TA), students, teaches, professionals and researchers using and evaluating pre-prepared animated character videos scenarios, and the study outcomes has reviewed the recent advances techniques of character animation, motion editing that enable the control of complex animations by interactively blending, improving and tuning artificial or captured motions. The goal of this work was to augment the students learning intuition by providing ways to make education and learning more interesting, useful and fun objectively, in order to improve students’ respond and understanding to any subject area through the use of animation also by producing the required high quality motion, reaction, interaction and story board to viewers of the motion. We present a variety of different evaluation to the motion quality by measuring user sensitivity, observations to any noticeable artefact, usability, usefulness etc. to derive clear useful guidelines from the results, and discuss several interesting systematic trends we have uncovered in the experimental data. We also present an efficient technique for evaluating the capability of animation influence on education to fulfil the requirements of a given scenario, along with the advantages and the effect on those deficiencies of some methods commonly used to improve animation quality to serve the learning process. Finally, we propose a wide range of extensions and statistical calculation enabled by these evaluation tools, such as Wilcoxon, F-test, T-test, Wondershare Quiz creator (WQC), Chi square and many others explained with full details...|$|E
