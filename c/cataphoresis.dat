In some products like lamps, {{the transport of}} {{radiation is}} an important design consideration. In other instances, such as semiconductor materials processing, the role of UV photons in surface processes is a side product and is poorly understood. Since the basic surface reaction mechanisms in semiconductor processing are now being developed, it is an opportune time to investigate the role of UV photons. As lamp geometries become increasingly complex, analytical methods to treat radiation transport become more difficult to implement. Design of lamps must therefore rely on numerical methods. To investigate radiative processes in lighting plasmas, a Monte Carlo Radiation Transport Model was developed and interfaced with a two-dimensional plasma equipment model (HPEM).

40|$|<b>Cataphoresis</b> {{experiments}} {{show that}} the virus of foot-and-mouth disease carries, under ordinary conditions, an electropositive charge. Its isoelectric range is at {{the high point of}} pH = about 8. Although cultivable bacteria are, as a rule, electronegative, yet certain protozoa, such as trypanosomes and spirochetes are also electropositive. In respect to charge, then, the virus is different from ordinary bacteria, but there is nothing in this finding to indicate an inanimate character of the incitant. A knowledge of the charge, however, aids in the interpretation of certain filtration phenomena, and indirectly in delimiting the size of the virus. In addition, it serves to explain its remarkable resistance to certain chemicals—a subject to be dealt with in the next paper of this series. Finally, <b>cataphoresis</b> indicates the possible separation of the virus from protein particles. Filtration experiments were made with different types of filters: Seitz, Berkefeld V and N, and Chamberland, of practically all sizes, collodion membranes, and Bechhold's ultrafilter. The results confirm the electropositive charge of the virus, as well as the minuteness of its size. Filtration was effected through the Seitz, Berkefeld, and Chamberland filters. In regard to the latter, the active agent passed through the L 11 only when its charge was shifted to negative: under ordinary conditions, carrying an electropositive charge, it failed to traverse this more dense wall, and was completely adsorbed in the oppositely charged barrier. Filtrations through electronegative collodion membranes, prepared in different ways and of varying thicknesses, resulted, as a rule, in failure, unless the thinnest and most permeable membranes were employed. But in these, the complication of microscopic holes was to be considered. Hence this method was regarded as impracticable. Success, however, was obtained with Bechhold's ultrafilter membranes of the most permeable type, and with these it was possible to measure relatively, by a system of "molecular" filtrations, the size of the incitant. This was found to be, in relation to other particles of like charge, between 20 and 100 mµ in diameter. The filtration phenomena of the foot-and-mouth disease virus can be accounted for {{on the basis of the}} minute size of the particles of the incitant carrying an electropositive charge, and no evidence can be deduced therefrom that the virus is of a fluid character. For the relative size of the particles is constant and the invariability of the limits of measurement contradicts the notion that the incitant may be a "solute" varying in dimensions in different "solvents. ...|$|E

All the fibrinogens show a remarkable uniformity of the precipitation pattern, viz. F. M. = 4. 7 (± 0. 2) pH in salt-containing buffer solutions and pH = 5. 3 (± 0. 2) in salt-poor buffer (N/ 100 acetate). The latter approximates the isoelectric point (5. 4) obtained by <b>cataphoresis</b> (14). There is no evidence that denaturation or digestion can produce any "second maximum. " The data support the view that fibrin formation (under the specific influence of thrombin) is intrinsically unrelated to denaturation and digestion phenomena, although all three can proceed simultaneously in crude materials. A criticism is offered, therefore, of Wöhlisch's blood clotting theory.

40|$|Due to <b>cataphoresis,</b> axial {{segregation}} of mercury will {{occur when the}} gas discharge of a fluorescent lamp is operated {{by means of a}} direct current. A consequence of this is a non-uniform axial luminance distribution along the lamp. To determine the degree of axial mercury segregation experimentally, axial luminance distributions have been measured which are converted into axial mercury vapour pressure distributions by an appropriate calibration method. The mercury segregation has been investigated for variations in lamp tube radius (3. 6 – 4. 8 mm), argon buffer gas pressure (200 – 600 Pa) and lamp current (100 – 250 mA) at mercury vapour pressures set at the anode in the range from 0. 2 to 9. 0 Pa. From the experiments it has been concluded that the mercury vapour pressure gradient at any axial position for a certain lamp tube diameter, argon pressure and lamp current depends on the local mercury vapour pressure. This observation is in contrast to assumptions made in earlier modelling publications in which one mercury vapour pressure gradient is used for all axial positions.

The model is then used to predict the voltage change in a hydrogen PCD (the optogalvanic effect) as a function of current, illumination intensity, and gas pressure. The results compare very favorably with experiments conducted to measure the OGE. Transient voltage changes induced by resonant illumination in a PCD are calculated by numerical integration of the model equations. Perturbation theory is applied to the equations to obtain more physical insight into the physics of the transient OGE. The experimental apparatus used to measure the OGE and that used to measure the electron temperature (double probes) are described.

In Sulphuric acid of fixed concentration the drop charge is found to be proportional to its volume. Results are also given for the charges in various acid concentrations between 0. 1 N and 0. 001 N. All charges are found to be reduced when the acid is saturated with mercurous sulphate. This seems to afford evidence that, in acid, the charges are due to hydrogen ions, and not to mercurous ions as had been assumed by several investigators.

Both theories lead to a set of simultaneous differential rate equations which describe the temporal variations of the important variables including the light intensity of selected spectrum lines. Computer solutions of both sets of equations agree favorably with the experimental results. In this respect the eight rate equations which result from the six-level atom are in excellent qualitative agreement and moderately good quantitative agreement with the results of the experiment. The rate equations lead to a consistent and logical description of the plasma characteristics both during the microwave power pulse and during the afterglow which follows. It is shown that the process He[superscript m] + He[superscript m] -> He₂⁺ + e + KE is very important for producing the afterglow light spike and the rate equations are solved in an attempt to determine the conversion frequency for this process. This conversion frequency is estimated to be approximately 5 X 10 ⁻¹⁴m³/second although the rate equations are somewhat insensitive to changes in this parameter.

K ion (0. 01 M KCl) increased the lower threshold value to 8. 0 µa. /mm. 2 and the upper threshold value to 32. 0 µa. /mm. 2, whereas the Li ion (0. 01 M LiCl) increased the lower threshold to only 4. 0 µa. /mm. 2 and the upper threshold to only 16. 0 µa. /mm. 2 The passage of electric current produced no increase in the rate of cathodal migration; neither was there a decrease until injurious current densities were reached. With increase of subthreshold current densities there was a progressive decrease in rate of migration toward the anode until complete anodal inhibition occurred. There was orientation at right angles to the electrodes in alternating current (60 cycle) with current density of 4. 0 µa. /mm. 2 and in direct current of 5. 0 µa. /mm. 2 when polarity of current was reversed every minute. It is concluded that the negative galvanotactic response of P. polycephalum is due to inhibition of migration on the anodal side of the plasmodium and that this inhibition results in the limitation of the normal migration of the mold to a cathodal direction. The mechanism of the anodal inhibition has not been elucidated...|$|E
40|$|The {{state in}} which a protein {{substance}} exists depends upon {{the nature of its}} combination with acids or bases and is changed by change in the protein compound. The nature of the compound of a protein that exists at any hydrogen ion concentration can be ascertained if the isoelectric point of the protein is known. Accordingly information regarding the isoelectric points of vegetable proteins is of importance for operations in which it may be desirable to change the state of protein substances, as in the dehydration of vegetables. The Protein in Potato Juice. —The hydrogen ion concentration of the filtered juice of the potato is in the neighborhood of 10 – 7 N. Such juice contains the globulin tuberin to the extent of from 1 to 2 per cent. The character of the compound of tuberin that exists in nature was suggested by its anodic migration in an electric field. The addition of acid to potato juice dissociated this compound and liberated tuberin at its isoelectric point. The isoelectric point of tuberin coincided with a slightly lower hydrogen ion concentration than 10 – 4 N. At that reaction it existed most nearly uncombined. The flow of current during <b>cataphoresis</b> was greatest in the neighborhood of the isoelectric point. This evidence supplements that of the direction of the migration of tuberin, since it also suggests the existence of the greatest number of uncombined ions near this point. At acidities greater than the isoelectric point tuberin combined with acid. The compound that was formed contained nearly three times as much acid as was needed to dissociate the tuberin compound that existed in nature. At such acidities tuberin migrated to the cathode. Though never completely precipitated tuberin was least soluble in the juice of the potato in the neighborhood of its isoelectric point. Both the compounds of tuberin with acids and with bases were more soluble in the juice than was uncombined tuberin. The nature of the slight precipitate that separated when potato juice was made slightly alkaline was not determined. The Protein in Carrot Juice. —The isoelectric point of the protein in carrot juice coincided with that of tuberin. Remarkably similar also were the properties of carrot juice and the juice of the potato. Existing in nature at nearly the same reaction they combined with acids and bases to nearly the same extent and showed minima in solubility at the same hydrogen ion concentrations. The greatest difference in behavior concerned the alkaline precipitate which, in the carrot, was nearly as great as the acid precipitate. The Protein in Tomato Juice. —The protein of the tomato existed in a precipitated form near its isoelectric point. Accordingly it was not present to any extent in filtered tomato juice. If, however, the considerable acidity at which the tomato exists was neutralized the protein dissolved and was filterable. It then migrated to the anode in an electric field. The addition of sufficient acid to make the hydrogen ion concentration slightly greater than 10 – 5 N again precipitated the protein at its isoelectric point. At greater acidities migration was cathodic...|$|E

The {{action of}} soap is {{explained}} by the following facts: (1) Carbon hastens the decomp. of soap in water by causing {{the formation of an}} acid salt. This combination of C with the soap is not stoichiometric but a combination such as exists between colloidal substances. The combination of the C with the soap is formed because of the difference of the electrical polarity of its constituents from water. (2) C suspended in water forms a combination of absorption more or less stable with the solid substances, especially cellulose. This, the author says, is proved by the fact that a suspension of finely divided C in water will give up its C to filter paper when filtered, and if the paper is then inverted the C cannot be washed off by means of water. There exists a combination of colloidal C and paper. (3) A suspension of C in soap solution is characterized by its stability. When filtered all of the C passes through the filter paper. In his experiments the author employed a 2 % soap solution and C from which all oily matter had been removed so that there was no chance for emulsions. It was found that there was an optimum % of concentration for which the C remained in suspension. In a 2 % sol. the C deposited almost as rapidly as in pure water, but in solutions of less than 0. 5 % the deposition was slower. In a 1 % sol. the C remained in suspension about 2 months. All of the soap solutions which had retained C in suspension nevertheless had a sediment. Acid and alkaline solutions of soap were tried with regard to their power of holding C in suspension. The acid solutions became clear rapidly while the alkaline held the C better than pure water does. MeOH and EtOH solutions of soap were also tried. The deposition of C from these took place more rapidly than in the case of water. Soap solutions which deposited C were examined to see whether any soap was dragged down with the C. It was found each time that the % of ash of the sol. which had been agitated with C and then filtered, was greater than the corresponding % of ash of the sol. not so treated, which was run as a comparison. The author concludes that the soap sol. was slightly decomposed by contact with the C into an acid portion which agglutinated with C and into a basic portion which remained in solution. The MeOH and EtOH sols. of soap when examined {{in the same manner as}} above showed less ash. This would mean that the solution underwent no change and that there was no agglutination with the C. This also explains why alc. solutions of soap give inferior detersive effects. The sediment of C deposited from soap solution is different in character from that deposited from pure water. It is oleaginous and viscous. A suspension of C in water was subjected to electrolysis. With a difference of potential of 8 volts <b>cataphoresis</b> is doubtful, but when the sol. is made slightly alkaline the C acts as if charged electropositive and is deposited around the cathode. A 0. 2 % soap solution when electrolyzed gave a white deposit around the anode after several hours. This, when separated from the solution and the ash determined and compared with that of the filtrate, indicates that the deposit at the anode is an acid soap while the soap left in the solution is basic. The author is carrying on experiments to show the action of silicic acid, iron oxide, Al 2 O 3, etc., in soap solutions. Also in Arch. sci. phys. nat. g. acte. en., 27, 229.
