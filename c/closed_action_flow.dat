5000|$|<b>Close</b> <b>Action</b> {{was first}} {{imagined}} in the 1980s by Mark Campbell and other avid Wooden Ships and Iron Men players as a [...] "fix" [...] to WS&IMs unrealistic simulation of Age of Reason naval combat. Campbell, while retaining many superficial similarities to Wooden Ships and Iron Men, changed the game mechanics significantly {{in order to}} create a more realistic simulation of period naval conflict.Over a decade was spent designing the game and play-testing in both small and large games, chiefly along the Eastern Coast of the United States. <b>Close</b> <b>Action</b> was finally published by Clash of Arms in 1997.|$|R

50|$|The main {{criticism}} of <b>Close</b> <b>Action</b> is the apparent complication of its rules, which {{are far more}} complex than those in Wooden Ships and Iron Men. This is, however largely illusory and the rules generally play as quickly as those of WS&IM.|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} for synchronizing a pulse light source to {{charge coupled device}} cameras is presented. The technique permits the use of pulse light sources for continuous as well as stop <b>action</b> <b>flow</b> visualization.

50|$|The {{two halves}} of the nut have {{chamfered}} ends (60° to axis), which helps the threads to find engagement during the <b>closing</b> <b>action.</b> Usually the screw and nut are also oiled for lubrication. Such provisions prolong the service life of the threads by minimizing wear.|$|R
50|$|When Parker {{raised the}} battle flag shortly before 8 am, for <b>close</b> <b>action</b> the British fleet moved closer, {{surprisingly}} the Dutch ships did not fire a shot as the British approached until the two fleets were {{about half a}} musket shot apart. Zoutman then also raised his flag, and when both commanders raised red flags at the same time, to signal the commencement of firing, opened fire, raking the Fortitude with a broadside. <b>Close</b> <b>action</b> ensued, lasting for three hours and forty minutes. Around mid-morning the Dutch merchantmen {{moved away from the}} action and headed back to the Texel. At 11.35 am Parker gave the signal to reform his line as the ships had become unmanageable, which dropped to leeward and limped away from the Dutch.|$|R
2500|$|Further, {{although}} human <b>actions</b> <b>flow</b> from prior {{causes that}} ultimately arise in God, and therefore {{are known as}} a metaphysical certainty to God, an individual's free will is exercised within natural laws, where choices are merely contingently necessary, to be decided in the event by a [...] "wonderful spontaneity" [...] that provides individuals an escape from rigorous predestination.|$|R
30|$|Fu et al. [96] {{proposed}} a NIDS {{that depends on}} signature-based and protocol-based anomaly detection. The proposed IDS structure focuses on detecting attacks on IoT networks without being affected by the heterogeneity of such a network. The detection method depends on comparing the abstracted <b>action</b> <b>flows</b> in the data packets against three databases based on the protocol type information for each packet. These databases are a standard protocol library, an abnormal action library and a normal action library. The {{proposed a}}pproach consists of an event monitor, an event database, an event analyzer, and a response unit. This approach provides a uniform intrusion detection method for IoT networks based on automata theory. The main features of this system are the classification of attacks into three categories {{and the development of}} graphical user interface (GUI) tools to graphically present the abstract <b>action</b> <b>flows</b> and detect possible intrusions.|$|R
