50|$|The <b>Civil</b> <b>Defence</b> <b>Service</b> was a {{civilian}} volunteer organisation established in Great Britain by the Home Office in 1935. In 1941, during World War II, {{the use of}} <b>Civil</b> <b>Defence</b> replaced the pre-existing Air Raid Precautions (ARP). The <b>Civil</b> <b>Defence</b> <b>Service</b> included the pre-existing ARP as well as wardens, firemen (initially the Auxiliary Fire Service (AFS) and latterly the National Fire Service (NFS)), fire watchers, rescue, first aid post, stretcher party and industry. Over 1.9 million people served within the CD and nearly 2,400 lost their lives to enemy action.|$|R
500|$|In 1944, Miller {{was again}} {{selected}} for the RAAF team. Near-death experiences and the knowledge {{that he could be}} the next to die, changed Miller's outlook to life. An RAAF teammate was killed on a mission soon after hitting a century. In a match against the British <b>Civil</b> <b>Defence</b> <b>Services</b> at Lord's in July, Miller had reached 96 when an air raid siren signalled the arrival of a German flying bomb. It landed south of the ground and then Miller struck a four to register his ton before another flying bomb crashed close to the ground as he saluted the crowd. In a match against England, which boasted five capped and four future England Test players, Miller scored 85 in 100 minutes. While Miller was at the crease, the RAAF was on track to reach its target but his partners were dismissed around him and the RAAF fell 33 runs short after losing its last seven wickets for 51 runs. He took match figures of 6/28 against the West of England at Bristol, and top-scored in the second innings of a low-scoring match with 14. Miller was also {{selected for the}} Dominions match against England, scoring 30 in a drawn encounter. The success of the season, especially Miller and Keith Carmody's attractive batting, prompted Warner to begin planning for a [...] "Test" [...] series between the respective armed services of England and Australia.|$|E
2500|$|Badcock {{played as}} a {{professional}} in the Lancashire League, for Nelson in 1934 and 1935, and also for Church in 1935. [...] He played cricket in England during the Second World War, for representative British Empire cricket teams, for <b>Civil</b> <b>Defence</b> <b>Services,</b> and for Northamptonshire. [...] Immediately {{after the end of}} the Second World War, he played a series of games for New Zealand Services against a Lord's XI, Australian Imperial Forces, WR Hammond's XI, Sir PF Warner's XI, and the Royal Air Force, including a final first-class match in September 1945 against HDG Leveson-Gower's XI. [...] Aged 47, he took 6–166 against a team that included Len Hutton, Cyril Washbrook and Bill Edrich.|$|E
2500|$|With these {{wide variety}} of {{involved}} organisations the Inter-Service Recognition Committee was instructed by the Air Council to [...] "Conduct {{an investigation into the}} state of aircraft recognition training and the methods of production and distribution of aircraft recognition material". The committee did not report until early 1942 when it concluded that having one body controlling training on aircraft recognition was not possible; but that there ought to be co-ordination between the armed and <b>civil</b> <b>defence</b> <b>services</b> and that there should be rationalisation of training materials. It was this last point that led the Inter-Service Recognition Committee to decide, in June 1942, to establish its own publication (A lesser point was the saving of purchasing large numbers of copies of The Aeroplane Spotter).|$|E

2500|$|In Britain, {{women were}} {{essential}} to the war effort. The contribution by civilian {{men and women to}} the British war effort was acknowledged {{with the use of the}} words [...] "Home Front" [...] to describe the battles that were being fought on a domestic level with rationing, recycling, and war work, such as in munitions factories and farms and men were thus released into the military. Women were also recruited to work on the canals, transporting coal and munitions by barge across the UK via the inland waterways. These became known as the 'Idle Women', initially an insult derived from the initials IW, standing for Inland Waterways, which they wore on their badges, but the term was soon adopted by the women themselves. Many women served with the Women's Auxiliary Fire Service, the Women's Auxiliary Police Corps and in the Air Raid Precautions (later <b>Civil</b> <b>Defence)</b> <b>services.</b> [...] Others did voluntary welfare work with Women's Voluntary Service for Civil Defence and the salvation Army.|$|E
