50|$|In non-Islamic countries, Islam {{has often}} been cited {{as a reason for}} self-censorship. Sometimes this self-censorship is because of threats of violence. Leaders of the member states of the world's largest Islamic organization, known as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (<b>OIC),</b> <b>called</b> for a {{categorical}} ban on anything that could be deemed as denigration of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in 2012.|$|R

At the summit, Mazari <b>called</b> upon the <b>OIC</b> to adopt resolute steps to condemn Indian atrocities and {{violations of human rights}} in Jammu and Kashmir. Concerned with the struggle of the Kashmiri people, he said that they had been denied their right to self-determination and condemned India's continued occupation of the Kashmiri territory.

5000|$|As of 2011, all Islamic {{majority}} nations, worldwide, had criminal laws on blasphemy. Over 125 non-Muslim nations worldwide did {{not have}} any laws relating to blasphemy. In Islamic nations, thousands of individuals have been arrested and punished for blasphemy of Islam. Moreover, several Islamic nations have argued in the United Nations that blasphemy against Muhammad is unacceptable, and that laws should be passed worldwide to proscribe it. In September 2012, the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC), who has sought for a universal blasphemy law over a decade, revived these attempts. Separately, the Human Rights Commission of the <b>OIC</b> <b>called</b> for [...] "an international code of conduct for media and social media to disallow the dissemination of incitement material". Non-Muslim nations that do not have blasphemy laws, have pointed to abuses of blasphemy laws in Islamic nations, and have disagreed.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2010, Fox News {{reported}} that the Washington Report had deleted from a 2007 article a comment by Rashad Hussain, the newly appointed U.S. envoy to the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (<b>OIC),</b> <b>calling</b> the prosecution of Sami Al-Arian a [...] "politically motivated persecution". Editor Delinda Hanley told Fox News she believed the change was made in February 2009, because the comments attributed to Hussain were actually made by Sami al-Arian's daughter, Laila, who also attended the event. But article's author, Shereen Kandil, told Fox News {{that she had not}} confused the two people. The White House also attributed the comments to Al-Arian's daughter. (In 2006, Al-Arian had entered a guilty plea to a charge of conspiracy to help people associated with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.) Hussain himself said he had made the remarks {{in response to a question}} from Laila Al-Arian, but had complained to the Washington Report shortly after they were published that they [...] "lacked context", and the publication eventually removed the remarks.|$|R
