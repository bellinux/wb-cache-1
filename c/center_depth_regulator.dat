50|$|Hydraulic toe erosion {{occurs when}} flow {{is in the}} {{direction}} of a bank at the bend of the river and the highest velocity is at the outer edge and in the <b>center</b> <b>depth</b> of the water. Centrifugal forces raise the water elevation so that it is highest on the outside bend, and as gravity pulls the water downward, a rolling, helical spiral happens, with downward velocities against the bank (erosive force). It will be highest in tight bends. The worst erosion will be immediately downstream from the point of maximum curvature. In cases with noncohesive layers, currents remove the material and create a cantilever overhang of cohesive material. Shear exceeds the critical shear at the toe of the bank, and particles are eroded. This then causes an overhang eventually resulting in bank retreat and failure.|$|R

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} steady-state separation surface {{formed by}} the 90 ° microchannel convergence of water into oil was characterized using fluorescence, confocal microscopy, and volume reconstruction techniques. Steady-state convergence was achieved {{for a range of}} relative volumetric flow rates, with an oil-to-water ratio from 1 : 20 (1 uL/min : 20 uL/min) to 1 : 3 (3 uL/min : 9 uL/min). The resultant interface locations, as measured at the <b>center</b> <b>depth,</b> showed oil dominating the channel despite the much higher volumetric flow rate of water. Examination of a vertical cross-sectional slice of the converged fluids reveals definite curvature, with the oil impinging on the water at the mid-depth of the channel. These effects, which are atypical for water versus water flow under similar conditions, are attributed to the immiscibility of the two fluids, their surface tensions, and the large difference in their viscosities and Reynolds numbers...|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} for estimating runoff from convective storms in the semiarid Southwest {{is needed for}} the design of small hydraulic structures. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop and test rainfall and runoff relationships based on the analysis of 12 years of hydrologic data for an 18 -square mile experimental watershed. rhe experimental area is divided into four subwatersheds ranging in size from 0. 5 to 7. 8 square miles, Vegetation and soils are typical of what is encountered in the valley floors of southern Arizona. Rainfall is measured at 29 locations. Isohyetal maps were prepared for all of the storms which lead to the development of a rainfall model that describes the distribution of rainfall in space. An exponential relationship was found to adequately represent the spatial variation of each storm. A single equation for all storms was developed by using a parameter that is related to the storm <b>center</b> <b>depth.</b> The Kolmogorov-Smirnov procedure was used to test the hypothesis that storm center location is governed by chance in areas not influenced by topographic changes. It was found that the assumption which states that convective storm cells are randomly located within valley floors is acceptable. An equation was derived for calculating point rainfall probabilities from raingage network data, The results were based on the random location of storm centers and on an extremal distribution function fitted to storm <b>center</b> <b>depths.</b> The calculated probabilities were found to be significantly higher than the observed probabilities determined from a nearby, long-term U. S. Weather Bureau station. The volume of runoff from small, semiarid watersheds was found to be a function primarily of mean rainfall. In a multiple linear regression model, mean rainfall accounted for 67 to 82 percent of the variance. The use of a time distribution factor which includes the maximum 15 -minute intensity reduced the unexplained variance to 11 to 16 percent. Inserting a space distribution variable into the model indicated that storm center location on the watershed was not a significant factor in predicting runoff. An antecedent rainfall index did not produce any significant correlation with runoff from convective storms. For winter frontal storms, however, a four-day antecedent rainfall index was found to be an important factor in oxplaining runoff. It appears that the commonly used Soil Conservation Service method underestimates convective storm runoff for most storm <b>center</b> <b>depths</b> below about three inches. A direct comparison with the multiple regression equation was not possible as this method does not take into account the variability of convective rainfall in time and space. As a means for estimating runoff volumes for ungaged watersheds, a runoff coefficient was defined as the ratio of runoff to effective rainfall (mean rainfall less initial abstractions). It appears that as a first approximation, the runoff coefficient can be considered as being equal to the coefficient in the well known rational formula. There is some evidence to the belief that the runoff coefficient is affected by a storm's time distribution factor. It was demonstrated that runoff volume recurrence intervals can be determined adequately from the rainfall and runoff relationships developed in this study...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{role of the}} {{binocular}} disparity depth cue in the deployment of visual attention is examined in this paper. To address this point, we compared eye tracking data recorded while observers viewed natural images in 2 D and 3 D conditions. The influence of disparity on saliency, <b>center</b> and <b>depth</b> biases is first studied. Results show that visual exploration {{is affected by the}} {{binocular disparity}}. In particular, participants tend to look first at closer areas in 3 D condition, and then direct their gaze to more widespread locations. Beside this behavioral analysis, we assessed the extent to which state-of-the-art models of bottom-up visual attention predict where observers looked at in both viewing conditions. To improve their ability to predict salient regions, low-level features as well as higher level foreground/background cues are examined. Results indicate that, consecutively to initial centering response, the foreground feature plays {{an active role in the}} early but also middle instants of attention deployments. Importantly, this influence is more pronounced in stereoscopic conditions. It supports the notion of a quasi-instantaneous bottom-up saliency modulated by higher figure/ground processing. Beyond depth information itself, the foreground cue might constitute an early process of "selection for action". Finally, we proposed a time-dependent computational model to predict saliency on still pictures. The proposed approach combines low-level visual features, <b>center</b> and <b>depth</b> biases.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this note is to report {{accurate}} measurements of the positions of O- and S-branch lines of the (1 - 0) vibration-rotation quadrupole band of molecular nitrogen ((14) N 2) and improved Dunham coefficients derived from a simultaneous least-squares analysis of these measurements and selected infrared and far infrared data taken from the literature. The new measurements have been derived from stratospheric solar occultation spectra recorded with Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) instruments operated at unapodized spectral resolutions of 0. 002 and 0. 01 /cm. The motivation for the present investigation {{is the need for}} improved N 2 line parameters for use in IR atmospheric remote sensing investigations. The S branch of the N 2 (1 - 0) quadrupole band is ideal for calibrating the line-of-sight airmasses of atmospheric spectra since the strongest lines are well placed in an atmospheric window, their absorption is relatively insensitive to temperature and is moderately strong (typical line <b>center</b> <b>depths</b> of 10 to 50 % in high-resolution ground-based solar spectra and in lower stratospheric solar occultation spectra), and the volume mixing ratio of nitrogen is constant in the atmosphere and well known.

During this prelanding phase the comet's heliocentric distance decreased from 3. 62 to 2. 93 AU while Rosetta was orbiting around the nucleus at distances between 100 to 10 km. VIRTIS-M, the Visible and InfraRed Thermal Imaging Spectrometer - Mapping channel (Coradini et al. 2007) onboard the orbiter, has acquired 0. 25 - 5. 1 micron hyperspectral data of the entire illuminated surface, e. g. the north hemisphere and the equatorial regions, with spatial resolution between 2. 5 and 25 m/pixel. I/F spectra have been corrected for thermal emission removal in the 3. 5 - 5. 1 micron range and for surface's photometric response. The resulting reflectance spectra have been used to compute several Cometary Spectral Indicators (CSI) : single scattering albedo at 0. 55 micron, 0. 5 - 0. 8 micron and 1. 0 - 2. 5 micron spectral slopes, 3. 2 micron organic material and 2. 0 micron water ice band parameters (<b>center,</b> <b>depth)</b> with the aim to map their spatial distribution on the surface and to study their temporal variability as the nucleus moved towards the Sun. Indeed, throughout the investigated period, the nucleus surface shows a significant increase of the single scattering albedo along with a decrease of the 0. 5 - 0. 8 and 1. 0 - 2. 5 micron spectral slopes, indicating a flattening of the reflectance.
