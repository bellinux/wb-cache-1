Our formulae generalize the classical Pfister’s ones concerning the representation as a <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> 2 ^r squares {{of the product}} of two elements of a field K which are <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> 2 ^r squares. As a main application, we reduce the representation of a positive semidefinite analytic function on R^n as a <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> squares to the representation as <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> squares of its special factors. Recall that roughly speaking a special factor is an analytic function on R^n which has just one complex irreducible factor and whose zeroset has dimension between 1 and n − 2...|$|R
40|$|Corporate failure exposes {{employees}} to the possible loss <b>of</b> <b>sums</b> <b>due</b> as deferred {{benefits such as}} arise from annual leave entitlements. Through such deferred benefits, employees are significant, often involuntary, providers of working capital to their employer. They are not necessarily adequately compensated for the risk involved, nor able to influence corporate governance in the ways available to other creditors. These issues have been largely neglected in the debate to date, and they provide the focus for an evaluation of alternative policies which have been proposed (or implemented) for protecting employee entitlements.

Asiong was recognized by many in Metro Manila due to the frequent appearances of his name in the headlines of the journal news. The only record of Salonga in the Supreme Court was dated March 28, 1946, which was concerned with his arrest without warrant on January 10 of the same year.|$|R

40|$|For {{a finite}} abelian group G, a nonempty subset A of G, and a {{positive}} integer h, we let hA denote the h-fold sumset of A; that is, hA is the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> h not-necessarily-distinct elements of A. Furthermore, for a positive integer s, we set [0,s] A=∪_h= 0 ^s h A. We say that A is a generating set of G {{if there is a}} positive integer s for which [0,s] A=G. The h-critical number χ (G,h) of G is defined as the smallest positive integer m for which hA=G holds for every m-subset A of G; similarly, χ (G,[0,s]) is the smallest positive integer m for which [0,s]A=G holds for every m-subset A of G. We define χ (G, h) as the smallest positive integer m for which hA=G holds for every generating m-subset A of G; χ (G, [0,s]) is defined similarly. The value of χ (G,h) has been determined by this author for all G and h, and χ (G, [0,s]) was introduced and resolved for some special cases by Klopsch and Lev. Here we determine the remaining two quantities in all cases. Comment: 11 page...|$|R

40|$|The paper gives {{approximation}} algorithms for the k-medians and facility-location problems (both NP-hard). For k-medians, {{the algorithm}} returns a solution using at most ln(n+n/epsilon) k medians and having cost at most (1 +epsilon) times {{the cost of}} the best solution that uses at most k medians. Here epsilon > 0 is an input to the algorithm. In comparison, the best previous algorithm (Jyh-Han Lin and Jeff Vitter, 1992) had a (1 + 1 /epsilon) ln(n) term instead of the ln(n+n/epsilon) term in the performance guarantee. For facility location, the algorithm returns a solution of cost at most d+ln(n) k, provided there exists a solution of cost d+k where d is the assignment cost and k is the facility cost. In comparison, the best previous algorithm (Dorit Hochbaum, 1982) returned a solution of cost at most ln(n) (d+k). For both problems, the algorithms currently provide the best performance guarantee known for the general (non-metric) problems. The paper also introduces a new probabilistic bound (called "Chernoff-Wald bound") for bounding the expectation of the maximum <b>of</b> a <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>sums</b> <b>of</b> random variables, when each sum contains a random number of terms.
