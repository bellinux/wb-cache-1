The prey are mostly from the order Hemiptera and are predominantly aphids on low growing vegetation. On crops, the larvae have been reported as attacking several species of aphids, red spider mites, thrips, whitefly, the eggs of leafhoppers, leaf miners, psyllids, small moths and caterpillars, beetle larvae and the tobacco budworm. They {{are considered to be}} important predators of the long-tailed mealybug under glass. C. carnea occurs naturally in many growing regions of the northern hemisphere.

Flupyradifurone introducedhere is thefirst representativeof thenovelbutenolide classof insecticidesactiveagainst various sucking pests and showing an excellent safety profile. RESULTS: The discovery of flupyradifuronewas {{inspired by the}} butenolide scaffold in naturally occurring stemofoline. Flupyrad-ifurone acts reversibly as anagonist on insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors but is structurally different fromknownagonists, as shownby chemical similarity analysis. It shows a fast action on {{a broad range of}} sucking pests, as demonstrated in laboratory bioassays, and exhibits excellent field efficacy on a number of crops with different application methods, including foliar, soil, seed treatment and drip irrigation. It is readily taken up by plants and translocated in the xylem, as demonstrated by phosphor imaging analysis. Flupyradifurone is active on resistant pests, including <b>cotton</b> <b>whiteflies,</b> and is not metabolised by recombi-nantly expressed CYP 6 CM 1, a cytochrome P 450 conferringmetabolic resistance to neonicotinoids and pymetrozine. CONCLUSION: The novel butenolide insecticide flupyradifurone shows unique properties and will become a new tool for integrated pest management around the globe, as demonstrated by its insecticidal, ecotoxicological and safety profile. © 2014 The Authors.

40|$|Analysis using {{polyacrylamide}} gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of four strains of the tobacco whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, collected from cotton in Turkey showed all insects to be assignable to the geographically widespread B biotype of this species. Bioassays with appropriate life-stages were used to investigate the status of resistance to two pyrethroid insecticides (bifenthrin and fenpropathrin), two organophosphates (OPs) (formothion and triazophos) and an insect growth regulator (buprofezin). All four strains showed significant resistance to pyrethroids (57 - to 360 -fold) and OPs (20 - to 310 -fold). Resistance to buprofezin was found only in a strain from Izmir. Total non-specific esterase activities were 7. 4 - 11 -fold greater than in an in secticide-susceptible strain, and were likely to account, in part at least, for resistance to pyrethroids.

40|$|The whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, {{which is}} {{variously}} {{known as the}} cassava, <b>cotton</b> or tobacco <b>whitefly,</b> is a cosmopolitan pest attacking {{a wide range of}} arable, horticultural and ornamental crops. As well as causing direct damage through feeding, and indirect damage through excretion of honey dew the insect is a vector of several major plant viruses, including African cassava mosaic virus, cotton leaf curl and tomato yellow leaf curl virus. In recent years there has been a general upsurge in whitefly populations world-wide and this insect is now regarded as the major threat to crop production in a number of countries. The reasons for this upsurge are poorly understood, but major contributors are {{the emergence of a new}} biotype with different host range characteristics and the development of resistance to conventional chemical insecticides. Recent research has demonstrated that microbial pesticides could play an important role in controlling whiteflies as Fart of an integrated resistance management strategy. Of the potential microbial control agents pathogenic fungi are the most promising because, unlike other microbes, they do not have to be ingested in order to infect the host; instead fungal conidia or spores adhere to the host, germinate and penetrate the insect cuticle, leading to infection and death. This contact activity is an important requirement for controlling a sucking pest like the whitefly. A number of species of fungi from several genera are being tested or developed for control of whitefly. These microbes can be produced at a local level using simple technology and are environmentally benign. Successful control has been achieved under field conditions and commercial development is underway. Two products are expected on the US market in the near future, one based on Beauveria and the other based on Paecilomyces. Research at the Natural Resources Institute is aimed at assessing the potential of fungi as one component of integrated pest and resistance management systems this includes the use of combined microbial formulations for use against pest complexes. The research is being undertaken in collaboration with the International Institute of Biological Control (IIBC) and is focused on the development of sustainable control measures for developing countries.

40|$|A {{resistance}} {{management program}} was initiated in Arizona in 1995, the initial goal {{of which was}} to sustain the efficacy of imidacloprid (Admire®) against Bemisia in vegetable crops. Due to the anticipated registration of additional chloronicotinyl (and related neonicotinyl) insecticides in Arizona, project objectives were subsequently broadened to address management of this entire class of insecticides in Arizona field crops. Results from three years of statewide monitoring of <b>whiteflies</b> from <b>cotton</b> indicated that <b>whitefly</b> populations in Arizona have become significantly less susceptible to imidacloprid {{in each of the}} past two years and significant geographical differences were described. However, no evidence was found of reduced field performance of imidacloprid in vegetables.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Pesticide-free refuge plantings of sunflower, kale and collards were created in association with other plants to provide habitats for the conservation of parasitic Hymenoptera attacking silverleaf whitefly (SWF), Bemisia argentifolii. At least five species of aphelinid parasitoids in the genera Eretmocerus and Encarsia were reared from the whitefly in south Texas. Relative abundance of parasitoid species changes over the season. Encarsia pergandiella was the dominant species and Eretmocerus sp. nr. californicus was the second most abundant species, at times outnumbering E pergandiella; usually at low whitefly densities. Encarsia nigricephala, E sp. nr. strenua and E. quaintancei were also collected. Evaluation of these natural enemies emphasized measurement of whitefly population densities and dispersion, the status of individual whitefly in these populations, changes in parasitoid complexes through time, and exclusion-cage comparisons of their impact on whitefly. Sampling targeted well-developed 4 th instar whitefly. Dispersion analysis of E. Pergandiella, E. sp. nr. calijbrnicus and whitefly demonstrated that insect species or plant alone did not have a significant affect on variance-mean ratios. However, the effect of density on variance-mean ratios was significant and at high density, aggregation was significantly higher than at low or medium density levels. These studies indicate there is great potential for indigenous parasitoids to regulate whitefly populations in Texas. Data showed that millions of parasitoids were carried through the winter months on relatively small refuge plantings. Measurements of total parasitism of 4 th instar whitefly reached 84 % on kale, with corresponding total whitefly mortality greater than 94 %. Parasitoid populations readily moved from the refuges onto <b>cotton</b> and maintained <b>whitefly</b> populations that never exeeded 7 whitefly per leaf through the harvest season. Parasitoids showed the ability to respond to whitefly population increases resulting from mass immigration of whitefly into refuges and untreated cotton plots. Parasitoid exclusion cage tests demonstrated a significantly lower whitefly survivorship in the presence of parasitoids than in their absence. Direct parasitism accounted for 65 % to 94 % of whitefly mortality. There was a cage effect against parasitoids finding the leaves in open cage treatments and {{there appears to be a}} significant contribution to whitefly mortality by other natural enemies, particularly predators...|$|R
30|$|The <b>cotton</b> <b>whitefly,</b> Bemisia tabaci (Genn.), has {{recently}} developed to a rather serious pest on several crops including cotton {{because of the}} expansion in application of organic pesticides, especially pyrethroids, presumably leading {{to change in the}} natural balance between pests and their natural enemies. A survey carried out in cotton fields during 1983 – 1984 exhibited three parasitoid species attacking B. tabaci, Prospaltella lutae Masi, Eretmocerus mundus Mercet, and Encarsia artenopae Masi. E. mundus appeared very active, playing a main regulating factor of population of this pest in cotton fields (Hafez et al. 1978 – 1979), where (46 %) parasitism was recorded in Lower Egypt and (59 – 71 %) in Upper Egypt. A high rate of parasitism (98 %) was also reported for this parasitoid against the pest on Lantana camara Linnaeus, which was unexposed to pesticide treatment. In 1984 / 1985, the average rate of parasitism decreased to 7.9 – 33.8 % on larvae and 44.2 – 60.6 % on pupae of B. tabaci because of the intensive use of pesticides in cotton fields.|$|E

40|$|In {{addition}} to direct mortalities caused by acute concentrations of insecticides, some biological traits of target pests may be also affected by sublethal doses. The <b>cotton</b> <b>whitefly,</b> Bemisia tabaci (Hem: Aleyrodidae) {{is an important}} pest {{of a wide variety}} of agricultural crops across the world. The control of B. tabaci largely relies on wide application of chemical insecticides. In this study, we analyzed the life table parameters to evaluate the sublethal effect of three plant-derived insecticides (Fumaria parviflora (Fumariaceae), Teucrium polium (Lamiaceae), and Thymus vulgaris (Lamiaceae)) and two chemical insecticides (pymetrozin and neemarin) on B. tabaci. The whiteflies were allowed to oviposit on plants infected with each of the five insecticides using leaf-dip method. The data were analyzed using the age-stage two-sex life table. We found significant differences in the gross reproductive rate (GRR), the net reproductive rat (R 0), the intrinsic rate of increase (r) and the finite rate of increase (λ) of treated whiteflies compared to control. Our results showed that some biological traits of B. tabaci are affected by sub-lethal doses of the plant-derived extracts and that these effects are comparable to those of chemical insecticides. Given the detrimental effects of chemical insecticides on human, environment and non-target organisms, plant-derived insecticides may provide valuable environmentally friendly tools for pest management programs. ...|$|E

Developmental rate was faster on eggplant than cotton, however it did not alter for egg and pupal stages on both hosts, but for nymphal stage it did. The statistically estimated lower developmental threshold (T 0) for the total development (egg — adult) of B. tabaci was 11. 94 °C and 12. 33 °C on cotton and eggplant, respectively. Based on lower threshold estimation, the average heat units (dd’s) required for total development on cotton and eggplant were 299. 1 and 313. 3, respectively.

The results indicated that L. muscarium and I. fumosorosea strains have potential as microbial control agent against <b>cotton</b> <b>whitefly</b> and mites, respectively, in Pakistan. The studies were also carried out to determine the LC 50 values and also efficacy of some commercial insecticides and acaricides against whitefly and TSSM in the laboratory. Four different insecticides were evaluated in the lab against 2 nd instar nymphs of whitefly on cotton. All the tested insecticides caused significant mortality of whitefly from 3 - 5 days post treatment. However, the most effective insecticides for whitefly, up to 5 days were Mospilonï¿½ and Confidorï¿½ with very low LC 50 values while others were also equally effective but with high LC 50 values. Similarly, the chlorfenapyr 36 SC, pyridaben 15 EC and fenpyroximate 5 SC proved to be the best miticides among the tested ones for the control of TSSM based on their LC 50 values. The nine commercial pesticides and their effects on germination of conidia and mycelial growth of highly efficacious fungal strains viz., I. fumosorosea and L. muscarium were investigated in vitro. There was a significant variation in conidial germination as well as mycelial growth by all tested pesticides depending upon the dose of pesticide and type of fungus. Among the pesticides tested azocyclotin was proved to be highly toxic to germination of spores as well as mycelial growth followed by pyridaben, acetamiprid and propergite while buprofezin was the least toxic. Isaria was proved to be more sensitive at field recommended doses than Lecanicillium strain to all pesticides. Generally, among all pesticides used the insecticides were more compatible to fungi than acaricides although these also inhibited germination of spores and fungal growth to some extent. The combined application of pesticides with selective fungi proved to be synergistic giving more control than used alone. The combined effects were tested under greenhouse conditions on potted plants. Buprofezin, acetamiprid, imidacloprid and diafenthuron were used against 2 nd instar nymphs of whitefly while chlorfenapyr, pyridaben and fenpyroximate were used against TSSM. Only buprofezin and imidacloprid insecticides showed synergistic effects and others additive while no one showed antagonistic results. Chlorfenapyr combined with fungus yielded highest mortality among acaricides tested. However, further investigations under field conditions may reveal more comprehensive results...|$|E

How do you: - obtain abstracts of recent research articles on sugarcane diseases-and get copies of the original articles? - identify and introduce a parasite to control the spread of a mite that is devastating coffee crops thereby creating economic disaster in an entire region? - identify an insect that is causing a disease of cattle in your country-and establish the effectiveness and environmental effects of a pesticide you intend to use? The answer for scientists {{in many parts of}} the world is to call upon the extensive resources of CAB international, a non profit-making international organization funded by 29 Commonwealth countries and based in the UK. Through its four institutes, ten bureaux and field stations in Trinidad, Kenya, India, Pakistan and Switzerland, CABl's mission is to serve the information and scientific needs of a broad cross-section of agricultural research specialists. CABl's mandate extends across the whole spectrum of agricultural endeavour - CAB Abstracts cover the world literature on subjects ranging from: animal breeding to plant production; pigs to rice; forestry to agricultural economics; human nutrition to parasitology; rural development to travel and recreation. There is a Pesticide Databank, and a database covering the world's largest mycological culture collections. Other databases are being added, with the goal of creating a major resource on all aspects of development - not just agriculture, but public health, population and other topics. CABI'S HISTORY Founded in 1929, following the Imperial Agricultural Research Conference in London, and with origins going back as far as 1910, CABl was known as Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux until January 1 st this year. A new constitution was drawn up in 1985 by a group of international experts, was approved by the Quinquennial Review Conference in September of that year, and is now in the process of being ratified by member governments. A copy of the document will be deposited at the United Nations who will recognize it as a Treaty; this will give CABl the status of an Inter-Governmental Organization., The change of name reflects a fundamental change in the nature of the organization and a definite commitment to increase outreach to all countries of the world. Membership of CAB International will be open to nonCommonwealth governments for the first time, and preliminary discussions are now being held with several countries who have expressed interest in joining CABI. Beginning in December 1986, the Editorial Units of CABllnformation Services, at present located at 10 sites in the UK, will be brought together in a new building, along with the headquarters of CABI, in Wallingford, midway between Reading and Oxford. This will reduce costs and lead to improved efficiency and flexibility, vital for the tasks ahead. Under Don Mentz, the Australian Director General of CABI, the organization is becoming increasingly active in the international arena with both its information and scientific services breaking new ground. A new Development Services division has been formed to coordinate a new range of specialist advisory and consultancy services drawing on the expertise within CABI which will extend the current mission of the organization. THE INFORMATION SERVICES All agriculturalists know how frustrating it can be when essential information is unavailable. The CAB Abstracts database of almost two million abstracts of articles from the world's scientific literature is a powerful resource for improved agricultural research and development. Over 14, 000 journals and many other scientific publications are scanned regularly and 130, 000 - 140, 000 records are added to the database each year. The original products of the Information Services-a series of abstract journals-are used by about 30, 000 subscribers in nearly every country of the world. Recently, special arrangements with development-financing institutions and International Agricultural Research Centres have made it possible for crop-specific journals (eg. Rice Abstracts, Wheat, Barley and Triticale Abstracts, Maize Abstracts, Lentil Abstracts and Faba Bean Abstracts), to be made available free of charge to specialists in developing countries. Though used mainly as the source of records published in abstract journals, the database is now increasingly used to provide customized responses to specific information requirements. The database can be searched online directly with CABI, or through online hosts such as Dialog, DIMDI, CAN/OLE, ESA (back to 1973), and BRS (back to 1980) SDI (Selective Dissemination of Information) services are available from CABI and online hosts giving weekly, monthly or quarterly updates on pre-ordained search criteria. Output is available as hard copy, on microfiche and on floppy disk. CABI is working with several international research organizations to provide sectoral or geographical services using monthly tapes of the new records on the database. CSIRO in Australia, for instance, provides information from CABI tapes to the South Pacific region; and ILCA in Addis Ababa runs numerous SDls on livestock production for distribution throughout Africa. National systems in the UK and USA provide vast numbers of monthly SDls to research establishments in their national networks. New arrangements are being negotiated to provide distribution of the database on regional and subject lines in various parts of the world. As a particular response to the needs of areas where communications lines are unavailable or too expensive, the database is being tested on compact disc (CD-ROM). The disc and search software test is being run in thirty sites around the world and funding agencies are being approached to enable pilot projects to be run in a number of developing countries. The goal of this development is to provide local access to the resources of CABI. The aim is quite simply to respond to the information needs of the agricultural scientist and to provide the most comprehensive, most responsive agricultural information retrieval system in the world. As a part of the overall mission to improve information transfer, CABI recognizes the need for training agricultural librarians to improve access to research results in developing countries and its annual training course 'Information for Agriculture' held in Oxford. UK. is now in its eighth year. The course has also been given in Sri Lanka and Fiji under the auspices of the Commonwealth Foundation, and the possibility of taking the course to a number of African countries is being explored. Furthermore CABl's Document Delivery Service can provide copies of most articles abstracted for its database. Thus the information system is becoming fully integrated and is performing the vital service of transfering information on a global scale. SCIENTIFIC SERVICES The staff at CABl's Institute of Biological Control, and at CIBC field stations in Europe, the Caribbean, Africa, India and Pakistan, have built up considerable experience and expertise in biological control, which is applied to research on such pervasive pests as the cassava mealybug in Africa, sugarcane borers in India. and <b>cotton</b> <b>whitefly</b> in Sudan. Notable successes have been achieved and the Institute is involved in contracted projects {{in many parts of the}} world. The expertise gained by staff is passed on to others in a series of training courses, many held in developing countries, to enable integrated pest management programmes to be established at a local level. CABl's Institutes of Entomology, Mycology and Parasitology operate similar training courses catering to the needs of Third World scientists which are undertaken by staff involved in the primary, work of identification. The institutes offer a unique world-wide identification service for insects, mites, microfungi, plant-pathogenic bacteria, plant-parasitic nematodes and animal helminths. Over 20, 000 identifications are made each year and over 140 countries have used the service in the past decade. Each institute has access to unrivalled reference collections and its scientists are world authorities in their fields. These staff are available for consultancy and advisory work. Assistance can be given to countries wishing to complete surveys of pests or diseases of crops in particular regions and advice on control mechanisms can be obtained. CABI is entering a new and exciting phase of its history. The needs of developing countries to increase agricultural production can be helped enormously by the information and scientific resources CABI has available. The organization is looking to a future where the urgent need for agricultural information in the developing countries of the world can be matched with the desire of bilateral and multilateral funding agencies to improve the availability of information outside the industrialized world. CABI is actively seeking collaboration with governments, organizations and research institutions to make the global transfer of agricultural knowledge and expertise a reality bv the end of this century.
