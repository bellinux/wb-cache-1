25|$|Following the Structuralist Era (roughly the 1960s to 1980s), the {{predominant}} anthropological and sociological approaches to myth increasingly treated myth {{as a form}} of narrative that can be studied, interpreted and analyzed like ideology, history and culture. In other words, myth is a form of understanding and telling stories that is <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>power,</b> political structures, and political and economic interests. These approaches contrast with approaches such as those of Campbell and Eliade that hold that myth has some type of essential connection to ultimate sacred meanings that transcend cultural specifics. In particular, myth was studied in relation to history from diverse social sciences. Most of these studies share the assumption that history and myth are not distinct in the sense that history is factual, real, accurate, and truth, while myth is the opposite.|$|E

The people enjoyed good wages, job security and generous retirement plans, were able to maintain their power regardless of how the economy was doing and, in many cases, pass these privileges onto their children via nepotistic practices.|$|E
5000|$|To {{complete}} the mission, the player has {{at his disposal}} an arsenal of beam weapons mounted on a jetpack equipped pressure suit. The aim is to destroy all ECDs in a specific order and avoid capture and death by the traps left by the terrorists. ECDs are <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>power</b> lines and can only be destroyed when all preceding ECDs have been deactivated, otherwise they will instantly regenerate. The player has limited amount of time available to {{complete the}} game, based on the energy accumulated in Zephyr One. When the weapon is fully charged, the beam is fired destroying Evath and the game ends. As the player destroys ECDs, the charge accumulation rate is reduced, allowing more time for the player to complete the mission.|$|E

50|$|Whenever the FCC {{would show}} up at a {{transmitter}} site, they would find a box {{in the back yard}} <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>power</b> and the internet. The owners of the house or business would then tell the FCC that it was some sort of radio re-broadcaster and they allowed it to be put there in return for the internet connection at their home/business being paid for. They would promptly unplug the transmitter, shutting down the offending transmission and the FCC, having accomplished its mission, would leave, usually leaving a letter of apparent liability for Monk, Sparky or any other name of DJs they had at that time. The FCC was unable to confiscate the boxes without a warrant (although they usually asked and were politely told it didn't belong to the homeowner so they couldn't approve anyone removing it).|$|E
