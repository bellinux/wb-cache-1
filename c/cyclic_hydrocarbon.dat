In cytochrome c oxidase containing proteoliposomes, both components of the proton motive force, the pH gradient and the electrical potential, were dissipated with increasing concentrations of <b>cyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The dissipating effect was primarily the result of an increased permeability of the membrane for protons (ions).

We find that the primary decomposition reactions of tripalmitin initiate with the successive scission of the alkyl-oxygen bond to form three straight chain C 16 H 31 O 2 center dot (RCOO center dot) radicals and C 3 H 5 center dot radical. The deoxygenated alkyl chain is produced through the decarboxylation of the RCOO center dot radical with concurrent production of CO 2.
