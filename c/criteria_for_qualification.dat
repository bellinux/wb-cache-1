40|$|Social {{protection}} {{in case of}} unemployment {{has always been a}} particularly contentious issue. This paper focuses on institutional changes in the unemployment compensation system in Germany since the 1980 s. It starts with a description of key features and the structure of the unemployment insurance system. The paper goes on to show how insurance coverage, benefit generosity (in terms of amount and duration of benefits), and eligibility requirements for drawing on unemployment benefits have evolved over time. Nearly all aspects of unemployment benefits have been reduced since the 1980 s. An exception to this rule {{can be seen in the}} duration of benefits; they were first extended and then subsequently reduced. Elsewhere, the pattern has been of cutbacks. For example, the scope of insurance (measured as the proportion of the labour force being insured) was reduced. This decline, however, was due more to changes in the labour force than to direct government intervention. Replacement rates for unemployment benefits and assistance were cut. In the case of the latter these were transformed into a flat-rate benefit. Finally, regulations regarding eligibility and <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> <b>qualification</b> and disqualification became increasingly strict. (author's abstract...|$|E

Lab. Its {{purpose is to}} provide a {{formulation}} of technical specifications for industrial applications, following the “test tailoring” strategy [1]. This methodology is based on field acquisitions of time histories, at specific points of measurement, enough large and representative of the vibration level of the component, so as to be indicative of the device stress state during its real operation condition. The methodology produces the Maximum Response Spectrum and Fatigue Damage Spectrum which represent the potential damage respectively in terms of tensile strength and fatigue. Then there is the formulation of a specification through the definition of the vibration profile which will have to be reproduced by the shaker in order to stress the component mounted on the shaker. The synthesis process can be carried out arranging an appropriate time reduction for the test with the shaker, in order to easily simulate (introducing criteria to define the equivalence of the damage) longer times of the component, under the real operating conditions. This article suggests a significant application of the Mission Synthesis procedure for an automotive case.
