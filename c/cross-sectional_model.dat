30|$|DECT offers VMIs, which mimic CT {{images as}} if the x-ray source is monochromatic. However, real {{monoenergetic}} images could be generated only via more advanced image equipment such as a synchrotron [21, 22], which is currently not realistic in a clinical environment. As a result, the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>model</b> and the VMIs are only approximations. Nevertheless, VMIs estimated from DLCT illustrated much higher accuracy than other DECT solutions [10]. On this note, {{the application of the}} <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>model</b> used in DECT was limited to a certain range of atomic numbers of the materials and could introduce errors for hydrogen (Z[*]=[*] 1) and higher-density elements (Z[*]>[*] 30) [4, 5]. In previous studies with DSCT, the estimation of electron density with images at two energies based on a <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>model</b> was not simple, because it involved a lot of data, such as x-ray beam spectrum and detector corrections. The errors ranged between 1.8 %[*]±[*] 1.6 % [5] and 2.3 % [6], which are slightly higher than our result (1.53 %). The highly correlated result for relative electron density approximation in our study showed that the fitting <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>model</b> is feasible and that the VMIs are highly reliable.|$|E
30|$|The above {{estimation}} {{results show}} that the developed mixed logit model can be successfully applied to model our SP panel data in which correlation of random utilities for the same driver needs to be accommodated. As a result, all the t test values of coefficients for the individual variables are smaller in the mixed logit model than those in the cross-sectional logit model. Comparison of adjustedρ 2 values between the mixed logit model and the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>model</b> suggests that the mixed logit model performs obviously better than the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>model</b> (0.2186 vs. 0.1350).|$|E

Findings of the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>model</b> are generally confirmed in a more tightly controlled longitudinal study of changes in VMT between 2000 and 2010, the first model of its kind.

40|$|The {{most of the}} {{existing}} LM tests for spatial dependence are derived {{under the assumption that}} errors of the model are normally distributed and hence are sensitive to the departure from normality. In this paper we present score-based tests for identifying the existence of various forms of spatial dependence in <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>models</b> as well as in panel models. The proposed tests typically modify {{the existing}} ones based on the techniques of Kelejian and Prucha (2001) or Bera, Bilias and Yoon (2008) by allowing the error distributions to be non-normal; hence they are robust against distributional misspecifications.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to model energy {{consumption}} and Manufacturing Value Added (MVA) in the industry level of five South Asian countries. Firstly, a <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>model</b> was developed by using R-statistical software to estimate the MVA with energy consumption being the independent variable. Secondly, a twenty years data series was analyzed to forecast volume of energy consumption in the manufacturing industry for five countries in a comparative manner. Thus, a prediction model was developed by using the time series forecasting system of the SAS statistical software and evaluated using Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) with forecasts made up to year 2021. The forecasted energy consumption data might be used in the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>model</b> to forecast MVA. Besides, based on the increasing trends in volume of energy, industry should prepare now for using efficient and clean energy in order to achieve an environment friendly and sustainable manufacturing industry...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} certain methodological {{issues that}} arise in estimating abnormal (or discretionary) accruals for detection of event-specific earnings management. Unlike prior studies (e. g., Dechow, Sloan, and Sweeney, 1995; Guay, Kothari, and Watts, 1996) that rely primarily on time-series models, {{we focus on the}} specification of <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>models</b> of expected accruals using quarterly as well as annual data. Perhaps more importantly, we present a variation of the Jones model that is shown to be well specified for all cash flow levels. We show that the <b>cross-sectional</b> Jones <b>model</b> yields systematically positive (negative) estimates of abnormal accruals for firms whose cash flows are below (above) their industry median. Using mean squared prediction errors as well as simulation analysis, we show that our model is more powerful than the <b>cross-sectional</b> Jones <b>model</b> in detecting earnings management. In addition, we examine differences in the power of current accrual models in detecting earnings management across audited and unaudited quarters...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} smoking behavior on earnings. Using data from the GSOEP, both <b>cross-sectional</b> and longitudinal <b>models</b> are estimated separately for males and females. Results for the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>models</b> confirm prior analyses inasmuch as smoking has {{a negative effect on}} earnings for males. However, applying fixed-effects estimation, this effect is found to be inverted for men aged 25 to 35 years compared to their non-smoking counterparts. That is, controlling for unobservable individual heterogeneity, the result implies that male smokers are individuals with higher time preference rates. At the early stage of the age-earnings course higher earnings are therefore found for smokers because young male non-smokers only are about to start off their occupational career. Women?s earnings, however, are not affected by smoking behavior...|$|R
