The Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court) is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of judicial review. Germany's supreme court system, called Oberste Gerichtshöfe des Bundes, is specialised: for {{civil and criminal}} cases, the highest court of appeal is the inquisitorial Federal Court of Justice, and for other affairs the courts are the Federal Labour Court, the Federal Social Court, the Federal Finance Court and the Federal Administrative Court.|$|E

[...] In <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> <b>systems,</b> case <b>law</b> only acquires weight when a long series of cases use consistent reasoning, called jurisprudence constante. [...] <b>Civil</b> <b>law</b> lawyers consult case law to obtain their best prediction of how a court will rule, but comparatively, <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> judges are less bound to follow it.|$|R
25|$|Denmark has a <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> <b>system</b> {{with some}} {{references}} to Germanic law. Denmark resembles Norway and Sweden in never having developed a case-law {{like that of}} England and the United States nor comprehensive codes like those of France and Germany. Much of its law is customary.|$|E
25|$|The UAE's {{judicial}} system {{is derived from}} the <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> <b>system</b> and Sharia law. The court system consists of civil courts and Sharia courts. According to Human Rights Watch, UAE's civil and criminal courts apply elements of Sharia law, codified into its criminal code and family law, in a way which discriminates against women.|$|E

25|$|Moore {{moved to}} Melbourne, Victoria in 1892, having been {{appointed}} {{as the third}} Dean of the Law School of the University of Melbourne, succeeding Edward Jenks. Moore was somewhat controversial as a new dean, proposing that Roman law (a strong influence on the <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> <b>system</b> predominant in Europe, but less important to the common law system in Australia) no longer be taught at the University, {{and the removal of}} legal procedure as a separate undergraduate course.|$|E
25|$|Trust law {{in civil}} law jurisdictions, {{generally}} including Continental Europe only {{exists in a}} limited number of jurisdictions (e.g. Curaçao, Liechtenstein and Sint Maarten). The trust may however be recognized as an instrument of foreign law in conflict of laws cases, for example within the Brussels regime (Europe) and the parties to the Hague Trust Convention.

25|$|The {{judicial}} system of Hungary is a <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> <b>system</b> divided between courts with regular {{civil and criminal}} jurisdiction and administrative courts with jurisdiction over litigation between individuals and the public administration. Hungarian law is codified and based on German law and in a wider sense, civil law or Roman law. The court system for civil and criminal jurisdiction consists of local courts (járásbíróság), regional appellate courts (ítélőtábla), {{and the supreme court}} (Kúria). Hungary's highest courts are located in Budapest.|$|E
25|$|Louisiana's <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> <b>system</b> is {{what the}} {{majority}} of {{nations in the world}} use, especially in Europe and its former colonies, excluding those that derive from the British Empire. However, it is incorrect to equate the Louisiana Civil Code with the Napoleonic Code. Although the Napoleonic Code and Louisiana law draw from common legal roots, the Napoleonic Code was never in force in Louisiana, as it was enacted in 1804, after the United States had purchased and annexed Louisiana in 1803.|$|E

The <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> <b>system</b> is based on Austro-Hungarian codes. The legal code was modified to comply with the obligations of Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and to expunge the Marxist–Leninist legal theory. Slovakia accepts the compulsory International Court of Justice jurisdiction with reservations.|$|E

25|$|The Constitutional Act of 1791 divided Quebec into Upper Canada (the part {{of present-day}} Ontario south of Lake Nipissing plus the current Ontario {{shoreline}} of Georgian Bay and Lake Superior) and Lower Canada (the {{southern part of}} present-day Quebec). Newly arrived English-speaking Loyalist refugees had refused to adopt the Quebec seigneurial system of land tenure, or the French <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> <b>system,</b> giving the British reason to separate the English-speaking settlements from the French-speaking territory as administrative jurisdictions. Upper Canada's first capital was Newark (present-day Niagara-on-the-Lake); in 1796, it was moved to York (now Toronto).|$|E
25|$|Under the {{principle}} of ‘one country, two systems’, Hong Kong has its own legal system, distinct from the Law of the People's Republic of China, {{and based on the}} combination of English common law (developed in local cases) and local legislation codified in the Laws of Hong Kong. Hong Kong has a common law system, whereas the PRC has a <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> <b>system</b> with socialist roots. Only a small number of PRC laws apply in Hong Kong by virtue of stipulations in Article 18 and Annex III of the Basic Law. The separation of the Hong Kong legal system from the PRC is guaranteed constitutionally until at least 2047.|$|E
25|$|The {{judicial}} system of Kosovo is a <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> <b>system</b> divided between courts with regular {{civil and criminal}} jurisdiction and administrative courts with jurisdiction over litigation between individuals and the public administration. As of the Constitution of Kosovo, the {{judicial system}} is composed of the Supreme Court, which is the highest judicial authority, a Constitutional Court, and an independent prosecutorial institution. All of them are administered by the Judicial Council located in Pristina. The Kosovo Police is the main state law enforcement agency in the nation. After the Independence of Kosovo in 2008, the force became the governmental agency. The agency carries nearly all general police duties such as criminal investigation, patrol activity, traffic policing, border control.|$|E

25|$|Each {{province}} and territory {{is considered a}} separate jurisdiction with respect to common law matters. As such, only the provincial legislature may enact legislation to amend private law. Each has its own procedural law, statutorily created provincial courts and superior trial courts with inherent jurisdiction culminating in the Court of Appeal of the province. This is the highest court in provincial jurisdiction, only subject to the Supreme Court of Canada in terms of appeal of their decisions. All {{but one of the}} provinces of Canada use a common law system (the exception being Quebec, which uses a <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> <b>system</b> for issues arising within provincial jurisdiction, such as property ownership and contracts).|$|E
25|$|The {{common law}} {{constitutes}} {{the basis of}} the legal systems of: England and Wales and Northern Ireland in the UK, Ireland, the United States (both the federal system and the individual states (with the partial exception of Louisiana)), Canada (both federal and the individual provinces (except Quebec)), Australia (both federal and individual states), Kenya, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Myanmar, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Brunei, Pakistan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Bahamas, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, St Vincent and the Granadines, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Trinidad and Tobago, and many other generally English-speaking countries or Commonwealth countries (except the UK's Scotland, which is bijuridicial, and Malta). Essentially, every country that was colonised at some time by England, Great Britain, or the United Kingdom uses common law except those that were formerly colonised by other nations, such as Quebec (which follows the law of France in part), South Africa and Sri Lanka (which follow Roman Dutch law), where the prior <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> <b>system</b> was retained to respect the civil rights of the local colonists. Guyana and Saint Lucia have mixed Common Law and Civil Law systems.|$|E
25|$|Scotland {{is often}} said to use the <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> <b>system,</b> {{but it has a}} unique system that {{combines}} elements of an uncodified civil law dating back to the Corpus Juris Civilis with an element of its own common law long predating the Treaty of Union with England in 1707 (see Legal institutions of Scotland in the High Middle Ages), founded on the customary laws of the tribes residing there. Historically, Scottish common law differed in that the use of precedent was subject to the courts' seeking to discover the principle that justifies a law rather than searching for an example as a precedent, and principles of natural justice and fairness have always played a role in Scots Law. From the 19th century, the Scottish approach to precedent developed into a stare decisis akin to that already established in England thereby reflecting a narrower, more modern approach to the application of case law in subsequent instances. This {{is not to say that}} the substantive rules of the common laws of both countries are the same although in many matters (particularly those of UK-wide interest) they are similar.|$|E
