5|$|An unusual <b>crop</b> <b>is</b> {{the growing}} of teazels around the River Isle near Chard on the heavy clay soils around Fivehead. These {{are used to}} provide a fine finish on worsteds and snooker table cloths.|$|E
5|$|Rice {{accounts}} {{for almost all}} of Japan's cereal production. Japan is the second-largest agricultural product importer in the world. Rice, the most protected <b>crop,</b> <b>is</b> subject to tariffs of 777.7%.|$|E
5|$|September 1786 – Houses are {{damaged and}} trees are uprooted by a hurricane, and the cotton <b>crop</b> <b>is</b> largely destroyed.|$|E
50|$|During Rabi, <b>crops</b> <b>are</b> {{cultivated}} in October-November, with cutting in April/May. The major Rabi <b>crops</b> <b>are</b> wheat, pulses, peas, alsi and masoor.|$|R
50|$|Its {{strawberry}} <b>crops</b> <b>are</b> well known. These <b>crops</b> <b>are</b> cultivated {{mainly by}} Japanese descendants, since {{the city was}} a common Japanese immigrant center.|$|R
50|$|Rice and mango <b>are</b> {{the only}} <b>crops</b> that <b>are</b> raised {{in all its}} 29 barangays. The third most {{important}} <b>crop</b> <b>are</b> a variety of vegetables followed by corn. Legumes and root <b>crops</b> <b>are</b> grown in small quantities.|$|R
5|$|A trap <b>crop</b> <b>is</b> {{a crop of}} a {{plant that}} attracts pests, {{diverting}} them from nearby crops. Pests aggregated on the trap crop can be more easily controlled using pesticides or other methods. However, trap-cropping, on its own, has often failed to cost effectively reduce pest densities on large commercial scales, {{without the use of}} pesticides, possibly due to the pests' ability to disperse back into the main field.|$|E
5|$|Four {{subspecies}} of cowpea are recognised, {{of which}} three are cultivated. There {{is a high}} level of morphological diversity found within the species with large variations in the size, shape and structure of the plant. Cowpeas can be erect, semi erect (trailing) or climbing. The <b>crop</b> <b>is</b> mainly grown for its seeds, which are extremely high in protein, although the leaves and immature seed pods can also be consumed.|$|E
5|$|Lettuce is {{the only}} member of the Lactuca genus to be grown commercially. Although China is the top world {{producer}} of lettuce, the majority of the <b>crop</b> <b>is</b> consumed domestically. Spain is the world's largest exporter of lettuce, with the US ranking second.|$|E
50|$|Almost {{all kinds}} of <b>crops</b> <b>are</b> grown in the district. However, its major <b>crops</b> <b>are</b> Cotton, Chillies, Sugar-cane, Wheat, Jawar, Bajra, Maize and Sun-flower.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>crops</b> <b>are</b> {{harvested}} as {{food for}} humans or livestock (fodder <b>crops).</b> Some <b>crops</b> <b>are</b> {{gathered from the}} wild (including intensive gathering, e.g. ginseng).|$|R
30|$|The <b>crops</b> <b>are</b> usually {{selected}} by its economic importance. However, the agricultural planning process requires a yield estimation of several crops. In this sense, five <b>crops</b> <b>were</b> selected {{for this work}} using the data availability as the key measure. Thus, a <b>crop</b> <b>was</b> selected when enough data samples appeared {{in the range of}} 6  years under analysis. In presents works, research is commonly limited to the 5 <b>crops</b> those <b>are</b> cotton, wheat, ground nut, jowar and rice. Example wheat <b>crop</b> analysis <b>is</b> discussed in this paper.|$|R
5|$|September 21, 1938– The New England Hurricane of 1938 {{passes to}} the east of the state, causing strong winds of up to 100mph (160km) and {{powerful}} waves along the coastline. The bridge to Brigantine collapses, leaving the city marooned. A Fall tomato <b>crop</b> <b>is</b> ruined, and half of the apple harvest is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The onion {{plant has}} {{a fan of}} hollow, bluish-green leaves and its bulb {{at the base of}} the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached. The bulbs are {{composed}} of shortened, compressed, underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale (leaves) that envelop a central bud at the tip of the stem. In the autumn (or in spring, in the case of overwintering onions), the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become dry and brittle. The <b>crop</b> <b>is</b> harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage. The <b>crop</b> <b>is</b> prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases, particularly the onion fly, the onion eelworm, and various fungi cause rotting. Some varieties of A. cepa, such as shallots and potato onions, produce multiple bulbs.|$|E
5|$|All three {{leaders of}} North Korea—Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il, and Kim Jong-un—have been smokers {{and the country}} has {{struggled}} to balance their public image with its anti-smoking efforts. In general, North Koreans tend to prefer strong tobacco and different classes of quality range from homegrown to sought-after foreign brands that are considered status symbols. As {{a percentage of the}} available arable land compared to consumption, the tobacco <b>crop</b> <b>is</b> over-represented in North Korean agriculture.|$|E
50|$|The main {{occupation}} {{of the people of}} this district is agriculture. All types of <b>crops</b> <b>are</b> produced. Varieties of rice, wheat, and a number of rabbi <b>crops</b> <b>are</b> produced.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the people}} of this village do jobs in {{different}} areas of the world. The major winter <b>crops</b> <b>are</b> Wheat and Grams and summer <b>crops</b> <b>are</b> Jawar and Bajra.|$|R
50|$|Agriculture plays a Vital {{role in the}} District’s economy. The {{important}} food <b>crops</b> <b>are</b> Paddy, Cholam, Ragi, Cumbu Maize {{and other}} minor millets. The commercial <b>crops</b> <b>are</b> Cotton, Chillies, Sugarcane and Groundnut.|$|R
5|$|In the autumn, {{the leaves}} die {{back and the}} outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle, so the <b>crop</b> <b>is</b> then {{normally}} harvested. If left in the soil over winter, the growing point {{in the middle of}} the bulb begins to develop in the spring. New leaves appear and a long, stout, hollow stem expands, topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence. The inflorescence takes the form of a globular umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes. The seeds are glossy black and triangular in cross section.|$|E
5|$|The largest area of {{production}} {{is also the}} Netherland, with 76% of the global cultivated area, followed by France, Chile, Japan, the United States, New Zealand and Australia. Approximately ten countries produce lilies commercially altogether. About half of the commercial production is for cut flowers. Many of these countries export bulbs as well as supplying the domestic market. The Netherland produces about 2,200 million lily bulbs annually, of which 96% is used domestically and the remainder exported, principally within the European Union. One particularly important <b>crop</b> <b>is</b> the production of Lilium longiflorum, whose white flowers are associated with purity and Easter.|$|E
5|$|The {{service sector}} {{provides}} most {{employment in the}} town. Limited agriculture is carried out; the main <b>crop</b> <b>is</b> paddy rice. During the British Raj, Sirkazhi was known for mats made {{with a kind of}} cyperus. The headquarters of the taluka and panchayat union administration, and many government offices are located in the town. There are no major industries within the town, except for several rice mills. Sirkazhi has many Hindu temples, which draw in tourism activity. Sirkali Coop Urban Bank, founded on 23 April 1918 is the oldest bank in Sirkali. All major nationalised banks and private banks have branches in the town, and all have atms.|$|E
5000|$|The rabi <b>crops</b> <b>are</b> sown around mid-November, {{after the}} monsoon rains are over, and {{harvesting}} begins in April/May. The <b>crops</b> <b>are</b> grown either with rainwater that has percolated into the ground, or with irrigation. A good rain in winter spoils the rabi <b>crops</b> but <b>is</b> good for kharif crops.|$|R
5|$|In the Bahamas, {{insurers}} and reinsurers estimated industry insured losses at about $300million (2004 dollars). All cool-season vegetable plantings, {{and the entire}} banana <b>crop,</b> <b>were</b> lost during Frances. The pineapple <b>crop</b> <b>was</b> significantly impacted by wind damage in Eleuthera, while the entire fruit <b>crop</b> <b>was</b> lost for similar reasons. The corn crop in Long Island and Cat Island was completely lost. Significant poultry losses were experienced.|$|R
50|$|Crops {{currently}} grown {{within the}} Irrigation District vary widely; one estimate claims over 60 different <b>crops</b> <b>are</b> grown annually. Over $2 {{billion worth of}} <b>crops</b> <b>are</b> grown annually within the Columbia Basin Project:alfalfa, wheat, soybeans, mint, potatoes, sweet corn, grain corn, livestock, apples, cherries, peaches, apricots, oats, barley, wine grapes, beans, sugar beets, carrots, squash, watermelon, and various other <b>crops</b> <b>are</b> commonly grown within the Irrigation District.|$|R
5|$|White pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) needs two {{alternate}} hosts {{to complete}} its lifecycle. One host is {{plants in the}} genus Ribes. On the blackcurrant, it causes the leaves to become pale and later develop tiny orange pustules and sometimes a yellow filamentous coating on some leaves. The fruit <b>crop</b> <b>is</b> little affected but the leaves fall early and growth is slowed the following year. The other host is any of the white pines, in which it causes serious disease and mortality for the North American species that have not co-evolved with the rust.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, most fruits rich in vitamin C, such as oranges, became {{difficult}} to obtain in the United Kingdom. Since blackcurrant berries are {{a rich source of}} the vitamin and blackcurrant plants are suitable for growing in the UK climate, the British Government encouraged their cultivation and soon the yield of the nation's crop increased significantly. From 1942 onwards, blackcurrant syrup was distributed free of charge to {{children under the age of}} two, and this may have given rise to the lasting popularity of blackcurrant as a flavouring in Britain. In Britain the commercial <b>crop</b> <b>is</b> completely mechanised and about 1,400 hectares of the fruit are grown, mostly under contract to the juicing industry. Commercially, most large-scale cultivation of blackcurrants is done in eastern Europe for the juice and juice concentrate market.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{vegetables}} {{were collected}} from the wild by hunter-gatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world, probably during the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a new agricultural way of life developed. At first, plants which grew locally would have been cultivated, but as time went on, trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays, most vegetables are grown {{all over the world}} as climate permits, and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations. China is the largest producer of vegetables and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries. The scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food, to agribusinesses with vast acreages of single-product crops. Depending on the type of vegetable concerned, harvesting the <b>crop</b> <b>is</b> followed by grading, storing, processing, and marketing.|$|E
40|$|Trap <b>crops</b> <b>were</b> {{employed}} {{against the}} pink bollworm (PBW) {{as a part}} of a community-wide IPM program in Pima County, AZ. Levels of PBW larvae in the early squares of the trap <b>crops</b> <b>were</b> extraordinarily high, indicating that the trap <b>crops</b> <b>were</b> drawing overwintered PBW moths in from wide areas. This concentrated the overwintered moths in small areas where they could be easily and economically destroyed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe digital {{model of}} the {{laboratory}} bench parts of digging deep rootstalk <b>crops</b> <b>were</b> established through adopting the parametric model technology based on feature. The virtual assembly of the laboratory bench of digging deep rootstalk <b>crops</b> <b>was</b> done and the digital {{model of the}} laboratory bench parts of digging deep rootstalk <b>crops</b> <b>was</b> gained. The vibrospade, which is the {{key part of the}} laboratory bench of digging deep rootstalk <b>crops</b> <b>was</b> simulated and the movement parametric curves of spear on the vibrospade were obtained. The results show that the spear was accorded with design requirements. It is propitious to the deep rootstalk...|$|R
40|$|In the study, a {{total of}} 898 soil samples and the {{corresponding}} <b>crops</b> <b>were</b> collected from paddy field, vegetable land, tea garden and fruit land in Zhejiang province. The total Cd content of soils and <b>crops</b> <b>were</b> chemically analyzed in the laboratory. The difference of the concentration index among the five groups of <b>crop</b> <b>was</b> compared. The result showed that 10. 63 % of the whole soils were assessed as the pol-luted level according to the second grade of Standards for Soil Environmental Quality of China(GB 15618 — 1995), and 4. 57 % of the <b>crops</b> <b>were</b> polluted. The concentration index among the five groups of <b>crops</b> <b>was</b> obviously different, changing from 0. 002 to 0. 257, while no significant correlation of total Cd content existed between soils and the relative crops...|$|R
5|$|The town {{experiences}} long {{summers and}} short winters,and receives an average yearly rainfall of , {{mainly from the}} north-east monsoon between October and December. Its {{close proximity to the}} sea means that Sirkazhi receives more rainfall than neighbouring towns. Sirkazhi is part of the Cauvery delta region and has irrigation channels, called the Kollidam channels, which carry water from the rivers and provide a rich deposit of fertile silt before reaching the sea. The soil is black and contains fertile alluvial sediment. The area's main <b>crop</b> <b>is</b> rice; other crops grown in the area are coconut, tamarind and neem. The landscape mostly consists of plain lands with fields and small portions of scrub jungle. Antelope, spotted deer, wild hog, jackal and fox are present in the jungles and outlying areas of the town. Crow and ordinary game birds are found in large numbers in the town.|$|E
25|$|The chief <b>crop</b> <b>is</b> cotton; {{also common}} are sugarcane, rice, and other crops.|$|E
25|$|Cotton {{remains a}} major export of the {{southern}} United States, {{and a majority of}} the world's annual cotton <b>crop</b> <b>is</b> of the long-staple American variety.|$|E
50|$|Cotton {{and corn}} <b>crops</b> <b>were</b> raised and {{ranching}} {{was an important}} part of the economy. During the 1930s, winter vegetable <b>crops</b> <b>were</b> grown and both railroads maintained shipping sheds. Mathis incorporated in 1939.|$|R
25|$|In some situations, {{polyploid}} <b>crops</b> <b>are</b> preferred {{because they}} are sterile. For example, many seedless fruit varieties are seedless {{as a result of}} polyploidy. Such <b>crops</b> <b>are</b> propagated using asexual techniques, such as grafting.|$|R
