Usually new equipment was first shown in this publication in order to initiate marketing of a new item. The company would mainly opt for the inside back cover which they believed would gain prominence for their new wares. In addition, around Christmas time each year National would produce tempting advertisements festooned with holly leaves. In the late 1950s, National asked the readers of QST what they wanted in a new ham radio receiver, with the result being the National NC-300 (and its successor, the NC-303). It featured a rare 30-35 MHz input for converters for 50, 144 and 220 MHz use (220 MHz equipment was very rare at the time). In 1965, National introduced the solid state HRO 500, which did not incorporate the HRO dial system, but instead relied on a direct readout rather than a <b>conversion</b> <b>scale</b> or chart. At the time, Popular Electronics magazine reviewed the HRO 500 as [...] "possibly the best amateur receiver ever". Today, many National radios are collected, restored and operated by vintage amateur radio enthusiasts.|$|E

Our study aims {{to point out the}} favorably contributing ‘ingredients’ of a successful revenue management application. We investigate what revenue managers have learned from their past experience by using real empirical data and fuzzy synthetic evaluation procedure. Researchers and practitioners may regard this work as a functional benchmark analyzing a function (revenue management) which is widely used in those companies belongs to a particular industry (hospitality industry. Design/methodology/approach: Revenue managers’ judgments about the underlying success factors are highly subjective and qualitative in nature. In order to capture this imprecision, we employed the fuzzy synthetic extent analysis and provided with a sensible prioritization of the success factors. Research limitations/implications: Employing fuzzy concepts within a prioritization procedure requires constructing a fuzzy linguistic variable set and as-signing a fuzzy <b>conversion</b> <b>scale</b> to it. Usually the implementation steps in fuzzy techniques are more cumbersome when compared to the conventional multi attribute techniques (i. e. conventional AHP).

We find that (1) in both early and late young M types, the model atmospheres imply effective temperatures (Teff) several hundred Kelvin lower than predicted by the standard Pre-Main Sequence spectral type-Teff <b>conversion</b> <b>scale</b> (based on theoretical evolutionary models). It {{is only in the}} mid-M types that the two temperature estimates agree. (2) The Teff discrepancy in the early M types (corresponding to stellar masses above 0. 4 Msol at ages of a few Myr) probably arises from remaining uncertainties in the treatment of atmospheric convection within the atmospheric models, whereas in the late M types it is likely due to an underestimation of dust opacity. (3) The empirical and model-atmosphere J-band bolometric corrections are both roughly flat, and similar to each other, over the M-type Teff range. Thus the model atmospheres yield reasonably accurate bolometric luminosities (Lbol), but lead to underestimations of mass and age relative to evolutionary expectations (especially in the late M types) due to lower Teff. We demonstrate this for a large sample of young Cha I and Taurus sources. (4) The trends in the atmospheric model J-K colors, and their deviations from the data, are similar at Pre-Main Sequence and Main Sequence ages, suggesting that the model dust opacity errors we postulate here for young ages also apply at field ages.

Supplier {{selection is}} a complex problem involving qualitative and quantities multi-criteria. A tradeoff between these tangible and in tangible factors is essential in selecting the best supplier. The work incorporates PROMETHEE- 2 and AHP in choosing the best suppliers. the result suggest that AHP and PROMETHEE- 2 process makes it possible to introduce the optimum order quanti-ties among the selected supplier so that the total value of purchasing becomes maximum. In the present study an efficient multi cri-teria decision making (MCDM) approach has been proposed for quality evaluation and performance appraisal in supplier selection. Supplier selection is a multi criteria decision making (MCDM) problem influenced by multiple performance criteria / attributes. These criteria attributes may be both qualitative as well as quantities. Qualitative criteria estimates are generally based on previous experi-ence and expert opinion on a suitable <b>conversion</b> <b>scale</b> (11 point fuzzy scale). this conversion is based on human judgment; therefore, predicted result may not be accurate always because the method doesn’t explore real data.

We postulate {{that in the early}} M types this discrepancy arises from remaining uncertainties in the treatment of atmospheric convection, whereas in the late M types it is likely due to an underestimation of dust opacity in the atmospheric models and an attendant overestimation of H 2 O opacity, due to insufficient backwarming by dust. Using the synthetic spectra to estimate stellar properties leads to reasonably accurate bolometric luminosities (Lbol), but overestimates radii (due to underestimated Teff) for the early and late young M types compared to evolutionary theory; this then leads to underestimations of age and mass, which we demonstrate for a large sample of young Cha I and Taurus sources. By selecting the model atmospheres which best represent the true stellar continuum at each spectral type, we then go on to infer the disk parameters for a selection of young, low-mass disk-bearing objects in Cha I by modelling the IR SEDs (again over 1. 2 - 24 um) using the radiative transfer code ttsre, coupled to the machine learning code skynet and a Bayesian parameter estimation. Just over half of the sample are able to be accurately fit by the analysis. No noticeable level of correlation is found between the extent of settling and grain growth in the disk and the stellar mass, an interesting result given the lessened gravitational/luminosity effects that lower mass objects should have on their disks. No correlation was also found between the disk thickness and accretion rate (a tracer of the system age), which, when coupled to the fact that a wide range of disk flaring indices are found, suggests that grain growth/settling occurs over a rapid timescale in the disk's early evolutionary sequence.

40|$|Coal {{transportation}} on the Chinese railways {{is known}} as a potential bottleneck for development. In this dissertation, several aspects of the issue are considered in conjunction with the railway 2 ̆ 7 s economic and planning system. ^ First, the historical background of rail network development in China after 1949 is examined. The rail network development shows an oscillation of politics in each period, in particular, the diplomatic relations with the neighboring countries. From 1949 to 1980, the government focused new line construction on remote area with ethnic minority groups to promote national integration. Since the new line construction had not been based on economic rationality, the current relationship between supply and demand remain unbalanced. ^ Second, the planning system in the Socialist economy is investigated to seek a cause of inefficiency in the operational aspect. Because the railroad sector is motivated to achieve objective numbers, such as ton-km, it has not taken heed of productivity and profitability. Even under the current transition towards a market economy, the new system remains based mainly on physical term indicators. ^ Third, coal transportation is analyzed by using network optimization models. This part comprises three topics. ^ The first topic, the linear assignment model, analyzes an optimal flow with the given origins and destinations. It adopts two types of capacity constraints: finite and infinite. This model estimates the twenty percent of the total coal movement is unnecessary and can be eliminated under optimized conditions. ^ The second topic, nonlinear assignment, develops an original link cost performance function to incorporate time factors. It analyzes the optimal assignment to minimize the delivery time. This assignment requires an additional five percent increase over the linear assignment with capacity constraints. ^ The third topic analyzes the relationship between coal prices and tariffs. Since the southwestern coal is more costly than that of the other regions, it cannot attract consumers. For coal consumers, cost is a total of coal price itself and transportation cost. This topic develops a <b>conversion</b> <b>scale</b> to include financial factors in the linear assignment model. A price reduction for southwestern coal can attract more consumers and reduce the total coal movement on rail. ...|$|E
