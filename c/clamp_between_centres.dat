5000|$|China - about 500 AD the jia xie {{method for}} dyeing (usually silk) using wood blocks was invented. An upper {{and a lower}} block is made, with carved out {{compartments}} opening to the back, fitted with plugs. The cloth, usually folded a number of times, is inserted and <b>clamped</b> <b>between</b> the two blocks. By unplugging the different compartments and filling them with dyes of different colours, a multi-coloured pattern can be printed over quite a large area of folded cloth.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the nonequilibrium quantum vibrations of a molecule <b>clamped</b> <b>between</b> two macroscopic leads in a current-carrying state at finite voltages.

Kinetic equations for the average populations of electrons and vibrons are formulated in the weak electron-vibron coupling case and self-consistent solutions are obtained. The effects of vibron emission and vibronic instability are demonstrated using few-orbital models. The importance of the electron-vibron resonance is shown.

Test specimen with centrally located hole is <b>clamped</b> <b>between</b> two bearing-guide plates using one bolt. Bearing-guide plates then secured to two bearing-load cells. Test specimen independently loaded at both ends, using two separate control systems identified as applied and bypass. If two end loads unequal, difference between them reacted as bolt-bearing load on specimen. Throughout test, two control systems synchronized by common input signal (increasing voltage). As result, loads remain proportional as they increase...|$|R
