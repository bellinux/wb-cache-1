A key question in determining economic viability is how closely windbreaks should be spaced. Assuming a conservative growth rate and tree height (20 feet in 40 years), the optimal spacing was approximately 386 feet, or 13 times the height of the windbreak. The net return results for the optimum pattern were 7. 61 % and 9. 23 % over unprotected production for corn and soybeans, respectively, assuming windbreak maturity is reached at 40 years.

40|$|Severe declines have {{occurred}} in the populations of wild game birds in Britain. This has been attributed to agricultural intensification, leading to the loss of invertebrates vital within chick diets, fewer feeding resources for adults, and inadequate provision of nesting and brood-rearing habitat. This paper explores the potential value of simple sown grass strips – beetle banks – in providing these resources, and compares results with functionally similar conventional field margins. The data indicate that beetle banks can contribute useful, albeit lower, densities of chick-food than conventional margins. These resources are more abundant later in the season, which may have implications for early hatched chicks. Beetle banks provide considerable quantities of nesting cover for adults, although sheltering conditions may never be as satisfactory as in well managed hedgerows. Given the ease and low <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> of beetle banks, we suggest that they may be valuable components within a range of game management techniques on the farm, as a ‘spin-off ’ to their primary role as overwintering habitat for polyphagous predators.

The substitution of work force in addition to reducing the cost in terms of mentioned items will increase the production efficiency. The substitution of products among the plants in seasonal and emotional demands needs to be answered during the application period, or in cases where production facilities are not capable of producing high capacity due to lack of storage space, increased satisfaction of demand estimation and reduced accumulation capital and production costs and ultimately high profits (win-win games).

Advances in communication network technology have the potential applications in healthcare industry. Healthcare industries are focusing on medical care; however urban communities will gain major focus and benefits because of advanced communication network technologies. The rural communities lack communication networks and medical facilities compared to urban communities because they are located at far distance and <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> is more. Both {{urban and rural areas}} have Power Lines (PL) which {{is used to}} deliver electricity. This paper proposes a method for Telemonitoring of Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using pre-established PL cables for Tele-healthcare application. In our work, ECG is measured by placing the electrodes based on Einthoven’s triangle and EEG signals is measured by placing the electrodes on FP 1, FP 2 and ear lobe. Measured signals are digitalized and then transmitted over the single phase PL cable using Power Line Modem (PLM) to a common monitoring place. In the receiver, signals are decoded and retrieved back. The ECG with fixed wave pattern was very useful in studying the effect of PL noises when compared with EEG which varies randomly based on the subject activities and does not have a fixed pattern. From the obtained results, it was observed that ECG, EEG signals where affected by the PL noise disturbances. Hence, filtration is required for the received signal to remove the PL noises. The cost of establishing PL communication system for Tele-healthcare application was less. Transmission and reception of ECG, EEG using PL was successful. It can be concluded that in future PL channel will replace all communication technologies and will be used in many medical applications to...|$|E

The objective of this work was to evaluate the seed production potential of seventeen grass accesses of the species Paspalum notatum, P. lepton, P. lividum and Axonopus parodii. The experiment was conducted at Capão do Leão, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, in a randomized block design, with four replications. The evaluated variables were: number of inflorescences per area, number of florets per inflorescence and seed production potential (SPP). In order to measure the seed production potential of the accesses, the equation proposed is: SPP = number of florets per inflorescence x number of inflorescences per m 2. There were year, access and interaction between years and accesses effect for the traits number of inflorescences per area and seed production potential. For the number of florets per inflorescence, there was no year effect. Potential production for the 2013 / 2014 harvest, ranged from 19, 152. 00 to 135, 062. 70 seeds m- ², with PN 09 of the P. notatum species standing out.

Using a Kaupapa Māori Research framework, this research investigates the benefits and barriers for Māori {{if they were to}} adopt GIS to assist their development outcomes. Internationally, indigenous peoples who have adopted GIS have reported they have derived significant cultural development benefits, including the preservation and continuity of traditional knowledge and culture. As Māori development continues to expand in an increasing array of corporate, scientific, management and cultural arenas, the level of intensity required to keep abreast of developments has also expanded. GIS has been used by some roopū to assist their contemporary Māori development opportunities; has been suggested as a cost effective method for spatial research for Waitangi Tribunal claims; has supported and facilitated complex textual and oral evidence, and has also been used to assist negotiation and empowerment at both central and local government level. While many successful uses are attributed to GIS projects, there are also precautionary calls made from practitioners regarding the obstacles they have encountered. Overall, whilst traditional knowledge and contemporary technology has been beneficially fused together, in some instances hidden or unforeseen consequences have impeded or imperilled seamless uptake of this new technology. Challenges to the establishment of a GIS range from the theoretical (mapping cultural heritage) to the practical (access to data) to the pragmatic (costs and resources). The multiple issues inherent in mapping cultural heritage, indigenous cartography and, in particular, the current lack of intellectual property rights protection measures, are also potential barriers to successful, long-term integration of GIS into the tribal development matrix. The key impediments to GIS establishment identified by surveyed roopū were lack of information and human resources, and prioritisation over more critical factors affecting tangata whenua. Respondents also indicated they would utilise GIS if the infrastructure was in place and the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> decreased.

40|$|Wastewater {{has been}} {{recognized}} as one of the most important environmental pressures in Mediterranean region. The last decades centralized conventional wastewater treatment systems were typically provided to large cities and secondary towns. However, the establishment and operation of theses systems in the Mediterranean region have been costly and problematic. As a result, the last decades several efforts have been made towards the development of alternative methods of wastewater treatment systems well established in the environmental and socioeconomic status of Mediterranean region. The increased concern for the use of the “Advanced Oxidation Technologies, AOT” may be explained by the need for seeking of new, alternative to the conventional ones and environmentally friendly technologies. Under this term the scientific community refers to the technologies whose effectiveness is based on the production of the ΟΗ. radicals, one of the most powerful oxidant reagents. They can easily attack the organic molecules leading to the production of organic peroxideradicals and their finally conversion to CO 2, H 2 O and inorganic salts. Among these, heterogeneous and homogeneous solar photocatalytic detoxification methods (TiO 2 / H 2 O 2, Fe+ 3 /H 2 O 2) have shown recently great promise for the treatment of industrial wastewater, groundwater and contaminated air, allowing the contribution of the renewable sources of energy (solar energy) to the process of cleaning and restoring the environment. In this study, the photocatalytic oxidation of synthetic, municipal and cesspool wastewater has been studied using homogeneous, heterogeneous and TiO 2 /Fe 3 +/H 2 O 2 photocatalysis. In heterogeneous photocatalysis, suspension of TiO 2 P- 25 and TiO 2 A were used as the basic photocatalytic systems, while in homogeneous, the photocatalytic efficiency of the Fenton, photo-Fenton and Ferrioxallate reagent under UV-A and Visible light were examined. The objectives were: a) to examine the extent of the oxidation of the wastewater b) to evaluate the kinetics and the relative photonic efficiency of the photocatalytic oxidation c) to compare the photocatalytic efficiency of the used semiconductors d) to examine the effect of various parameters like the mass of the catalyst, the addition of an oxidant, pH, etc e) to examine the efficiency of the photocatalytic disinfection. As far as heterogeneous photocatalysis is concerned, TiO 2 P- 25 proved to be more efficient photocatalyst. Parameters such as pH, concentration of the catalyst and the H 2 O 2 play an important role affecting the initial reaction rate and the relative photonic efficiency. By the addition of H 2 O 2 into TiO 2 illuminated suspensions a synergistic effect is observed leading to the enhancement of the process. As far as mineralization is concerned, illuminated TiO 2 P- 25 /H 2 O 2 systems are able to achieve higher percentage of oxidation (maximum about 50 %), dependant on the amount of the catalyst, the concentration of the oxidant and the pH of the wastewater. As far as homogeneous photocatalysis is concerned, photo-Fenton reaction is able to achieve higher initial reaction rates and extent of mineralization. It is proved to be much faster. In general, the photo-Fenton and Ferrioxallate reagent give similar efficiency, while Fenton reaction, in the absence of light, is not able to achieve satisfactory results, thus requiring larger quantities or iron and oxidant. The irradiation of the above solutions by UV-A or Visible light leads to the regeneration of the Fe 2 +, the extra production of hydroxyl radicals providing higher extent of the mineralization. The concentration of iron or peroxide and temperature are parameters that affect the efficiency of the system. Furthermore, the efficiency of the TiO 2 /Fe 3 +/H 2 O 2 reagent was examined. The presence of the ferric ions multiplies the initial reaction rate and the extent of mineralization of the wastewater. Parameters such as the TiO 2, Fe 3 + and the oxidant concentration and the pH affect severely the efficiency of the above system. The stepwise addition of the oxidant gives the maximum efficiency. Comparison of the three above photocatalytic methods showed that homogeneous photocatalysis and the TiO 2 /Fe 3 +/H 2 O 2 reagent are able to achieve satisfactory extent of the mineralization of the wastewater. However, the TiO 2 /Fe 3 +/H 2 O 2 reagent seems to be the most appropriate, since it can provide high efficiency, while at the same time, a severe reduction of the needed amounts of the reagents can be fulfilled. In order to develop a simple and effective solar photocatalytic method for the treatment of municipal wastewater of small communities and villages in small islands in the area of the Aegean Sea, where there is a wide variation of the population between the winter and the tourist season and where the biological treatment of the wastewater has a lot of disadvantages. More specifically, the system combines the synergetic action of the heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation with the surface flow constructed wetlands in order to utilize the high solar irradiation and the ability of the constructed wetlands to improve water quality through natural processes. According to the results, the two methods are compatible, under terms, and the combined system may effectively treat synthetic, municipal and cesspool wastewater by reducing the concentration of pollutants at levels required by the Greek and European legislation. Comparing to conventional systems of wastewater treatment, the main advantages of the combined system are: Low <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> and operation Ability to treat wastewater with great variability of hydraulic and pollutants load. Low requirements in chemicals and energy and utilization of solar energy and natural processes No need for additional disinfection method. This combination gives an integrated system for treating municipal wastewater, that has a lower investment cost and has the possibility of treating different volumes, while it makes possible the reuse of the treated wastewater. ...|$|E
40|$|Achieving higher lamb weaning {{percentages}} {{by reducing}} lamb mortality {{can improve the}} profitability of sheep enterprises. In this paper we estimated the financial benefits from providing shelter to reduce the mortality of twin lambs in self-replacing Merino or dual-purpose Merino flock enterprises in south-west Victoria. A whole-farm bio-economic model (MIDAS) was initially used to estimate the increase in profit from reducing mortality of twin lambs and a second analysis included the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> using perennial grass hedges to provide the shelter during lambing. The economic value of providing shelter was tested at three rates of twinning (10, 30 and 50 %), three rates of mortality without shelter (70, 50 and 30 %) and two levels of reduction in lamb mortality by providing shelter (25 and 50 % reduction). A sensitivity analysis to wool and lamb prices, <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> establishing the grass hedges and stocking rates in the shelter area were also tested. Overall, more than 2500 scenarios were tested. Across the range of twinning rates and levels of twin mortality tested, at standard wool and meat prices, providing shelter to the dual-purpose Merino ewe flock was always profitable ($ 0. 05 to 11. 35 /ewe) and the profits from providing shelter to the self-replacing Merino ewe flock were generally lower ($ 0. 15 to $ 6. 35 /ewe). The impacts of changing wool and lamb prices depended on enterprise type, whereas the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> the hedges or stocking rate of ewes in the hedge area during lambing had little impact on profitability. The main factor that determined the economic return from shelter was the reduction in mortality provided by the shelter but the proportion of twin-bearing ewes in the flock and the base rate of lamb mortality without shelter was also important. Overall, based on the assumptions used, we conclude that the profitability of many sheep enterprises lambing during frequent high chill weather conditions in temperate areas of south-eastern Australia could be improved by providing low cost shelter for twin-bearing Merino ewes lambing from July to September...|$|R

30|$|However, {{given the}} large area of {{previously}} cleared land, {{there has been}} strong interest in the potential for sequestration from planted forests under a range of carbon price and land availability scenarios. Several spatial analyses at a national scale have assessed the economic potential for plantations under a carbon market using physiological growth models and agricultural land opportunity costs, with estimates ranging from less than 350 000 ha up to 9 Mha by 2050 (Stephens and Grist 2014). In {{the absence of a}} carbon price, Paul et al. (2013) found that <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> new plantations for wood production on agricultural land was not presently viable in Australia given current <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment.</b> However, on average, for scenarios of hardwoods (Eucalyptus spp.) and softwoods (e.g. Pinus radiata), a payment of about $A 10 and $A 30 /t CO 2 respectively would make plantation expansion viable assuming a 4 % carbon price increase per year, with an initial price above $A 20 /t CO 2 needed in the majority of scenarios for south-eastern Australia. The scenarios included short- and long-rotation plantations for pulpwood and sawlogs and the crediting of carbon stored in wood products and soils. The findings are consistent with de Fegeley et al. (2011) who suggested that without a carbon price new wood plantations {{would not be able to}} meet the investment hurdle rate.|$|R
