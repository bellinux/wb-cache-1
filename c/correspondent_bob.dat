According to Schieffer, Johnson's aide George Christian [...] "told me that the President apparently saw some clips of it the next day" [...] and that [...] "That's when he made the remark about Cronkite. But he knew then that it would take more than Americans were willing to give it." [...] When asked about the remark during a 1979 interview, Christian claimed he had no recollection about what the President had said. In his 1996 memoir A Reporter's Life, Cronkite claimed he was at first unsure about how much of an impact his editorial report had on Johnson's decision to drop his bid for re-election, and what eventually convinced him that the President had made the statement was Bill Moyers, fellow journalist and former aide to Johnson, telling him [...] "The president flipped off the set and said 'If I've lost Cronkite, I've lost Middle America.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{has also}} been {{reported}} that Johnson decided to wind down his re-election bid after popular and influential CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite turned against the president's policy in Vietnam and recommended peace negotiations during a CBS News editorial which aired on February 27.

[...] Issues surrounding reports of this allegation have raised questions about its accuracy, such {{as the fact that}} Johnson was attending Texas Governor John Connally's birthday gala in Austin, Texas, when Cronkite's editorial aired and thus was unable to see the original broadcast.

5000|$|Many {{observers}} {{have said that}} Peretz's charge of anti-Semitism {{on the part of}} Marius—who castigated figures such as Martin Luther for their anti-Semitic writings in his scholarly work—was false.

University of Tennessee historian Milton Klein, whose European relatives were murdered during the Holocaust in Hungary, said that he and Marius had often argued about the Israel-Palestine issue during their 26 years of friendship, but Marius had never said a single thing that indicated any anti-Semitic feelings.

[...] Cramer described a variety of tactics that hedge fund managers use to affect a stock's price. Cramer said that one strategy to keep a stock price down is to spread false rumors to reporters he described as [...] "the Pisanis of the world."
