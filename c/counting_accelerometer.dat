The {{purpose was to}} investigate the ability of accelerometers to assess physical activity intensity and number of steps in normal-weight compared with overweight children. METHODS: Eleven normal-weight and 14 overweight African American children walked at 2, 4, 5, and 6 km/h on a treadmill wearing Lifecorder, ActiGraph, RT 3, and Biotrainer. Oxygen uptake was measured and steps manually counted. Fat free mass (FFM) was assessed from bioelectrical impedance analysis. <b>Accelerometer</b> <b>counts</b> and the individual linear regression lines of <b>accelerometer</b> <b>counts</b> versus VO 2 /FFM were evaluated, together with steps recorded by Lifecorder and Actigraph. RESULTS: Correlations between <b>accelerometer</b> <b>counts</b> and VO 2 /FFM for all monitors were r ≥. 95 (P <. 01). The <b>accelerometer</b> <b>counts</b> and their relationship to VO 2 /FFM did not generally differ significantly by body weight status. Lifecorder and Actigraph underestimated steps at 4, 5, and 6 km/h by less than 9 %, but the error was up to - 95 % at 2 km/h.

Three models are fitted: (1 a) A regression of fat mass at age 12 (N = 4164) onto the histogram of <b>accelerometer</b> <b>counts</b> at age 12; (1 b) A regression of fat mass at age 14 (N = 2403) onto the histogram of <b>accelerometer</b> <b>counts</b> at age 12 and (1 c) a regression of fat mass at age 14 (N= 2413) onto the <b>accelerometer</b> <b>counts</b> at age 14.

Secondary aims were to investigate changes from baseline to 6 and 12 months in a number of physiological, biochemical and quality of life variables. 70 inactive people with Type 2 diabetes (35 M 35 F, mean age 57. 6 ± 7. 9 yrs, BMI 34. 6 ± 6. 8) were given standard exercise information and randomised to receive an exercise consultation intervention (experimental group n= 35) or not (control group n= 35). Exercise consultation, based on the transtheoretical model, combines motivational theory and cognitive behavioural strategies into an individualised intervention to promote and maintain physical activity. Exercise consultations were delivered at baseline and 6 months and support phone calls were given 1 and 3 months after each exercise consultation.

Individual differences in leg length, stride length and stride frequency may affect {{the reliability and validity}} of accelerometers in estimating energy expenditure. To address this theory, this thesis investigated the influence of leg length, stride length and stride frequency on <b>accelerometer</b> <b>counts</b> and energy expenditure using four accelerometers (AMP, Actical, MTI, and RT 3) and one pedometer (Yamax). Eighty-six participants, age 8 to 40 (17. 6 ± 8. 0) years performed three ten-minute bouts of treadmill activity at self-selected speeds (4 to 12 km/h). Energy expenditure (kcal/min) was measured through expired gas analysis and used as the criterion standard to compare physical activity data from activity monitors. A 3 (models) x 2 (duplicates of each model) x 3 (speeds) x 7 (minutes) repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess intra-device, inter-device, and inter-model reliability. Coefficients of variation were calculated to compare within-device variation and between-device variation in <b>accelerometer</b> <b>counts.</b> Differences between measured and predicted energy expenditure were assessed across five height categories to determine the influence of leg length on the validity of accelerometer/pedometer data. Regression equations for each model were developed using mean activity counts/steps generated for each speed, adjusting for various predictor variables (i. e., age, weight, leg length). These were compared to model-specific equations to determine whether the addition of certain variables might explain more variance in energy expenditure. Leg length and stride frequency directly influenced variability in accelerometer data and thus predicted energy expenditure. At high speeds and stride frequencies counts began to level off in the Actical, however this did not occur in the other devices.

Methods Pregnant women (n = 58) with body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m 2 at median 13 weeks' gestation wore a GT 1 M Actigraph accelerometer and a Yamax Digi-Walker CW- 701 pedometer for four consecutive days. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients were determined between pedometer step <b>counts</b> and various <b>accelerometer</b> measures of PA. Total agreement between accelerometer and pedometer step counts was evaluated by determining the 95 % limits of agreement estimated using a regression-based method. Agreement between the monitors in categorising participants as active or inactive was assessed by determining Kappa. Results Pedometer step counts correlated moderately (r = 0. 36 to 0. 54) with most accelerometer measures of PA. Overall step counts recorded by the pedometer and the accelerometer {{were not significantly different}} (medians 5961 vs. 5687 steps/day, p = 0. 37). However, the 95 % limits of agreement ranged from - 2690 to 2656 steps/day for the mean step count value (6026 steps/day) and changed substantially over the range of values. Agreement between the monitors in categorising participants to active and inactive varied from moderate to good depending on the criteria adopted. Conclusions Despite statistically significant correlations and similar median step counts, the overall agreement between pedometer and <b>accelerometer</b> step <b>counts</b> was poor and varied with activity level.

40|$|Accelerometer {{measurements}} are the prime type of sensor information most {{think of when}} seeking to measure physical activity. On the market, there are many fitness measuring devices which aim to track calories burned and steps counted {{through the use of}} accelerometers. These measurements, though good enough for the average consumer, are noisy and unreliable in terms of the precision of measurement needed in a scientific setting. The contribution of this paper is an innovative and highly accurate regression method which uses an intermediary two-stage classification step to better direct the regression of energy expenditure values from <b>accelerometer</b> <b>counts.</b> We show that through an additional unsupervised layer of intermediate feature construction, we can leverage latent patterns within <b>accelerometer</b> <b>counts</b> to provide better grounds for activity classification than expert-constructed timeseries features. For this, our approach utilizes a mathematical model originating in natural language processing, the bag-of-words model, that has in the past years been appearing in diverse disciplines outside of the natural language processing field such as image processing. Further emphasizing the natural language connection to stochastics, we use a gaussian mixture model to learn the dictionary upon which the bag-of-words model is built.

Participants were 1518 girls (aged 13. 6 ± 0. 02 years) from 24 secondary schools in New South Wales, Australia. Useable accelerometer (≥ 10 hours day− 1 on at least 3 days) and questionnaire data were obtained from 68 % of this sample (N = 1035). Participants completed questionnaires assessing psychological, behavioural, social and environmental correlates of activity. The theoretical model was tested using structural equation modelling in AMOS. The model explaining <b>accelerometer</b> <b>counts</b> per minute was an adequate-to-good fit to the data (Tucker–Lewis Index = 0. 89, the comparative fit index = 0. 97 and the root mean square of approximation = 0. 098; 90 % confidence interval = 0. 075 – 0. 122) but explained only 5 % of the variance in activity.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, an {{increasing}} number of scientific studies have examined associations between the built environment and physical activity and obesity. These studies have documented positive associations between environmental variables, such as population density, street connectivity, and composite measures of neighborhood walkability and physical activity. Studies have also shown inverse relationships between the presence of neighborhood grocery stores and recreational facilities and obesity. Despite this evidence, there continues to be limitations in built environment studies conducted to date. The three dissertation studies described here were designed to address several different aspects of built environment research that warrant greater attention. The first study addressed the issue of whether physical activity and obesity is spatially clustered in relation to certain attributes of the built environment. Many previous built environment studies used geographically referenced data, such as geocoded home addresses and locations of facilities. The use of these types of data neglected spatial relationships among observations. ^ The second study examined whether objectively measured trail use was associated with physical activity and sedentary behavior. The study also quantified on-trail physical activity using two approaches: <b>accelerometer</b> <b>counts</b> only and both counts and GPS data. Participants (N = 141, mean age = 44. 1 ± 13. 0) were recruited on five trails in Massachusetts. They were asked to wear accelerometer and GPS devices for four days. Total physical activity, and daily minutes of light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity, and sedentary behavior were derived from <b>accelerometer</b> <b>counts.</b> A trail-use day was defined as a minimum of two consecutive monitoring minutes occurring on-trail. Linear mixed models were used to examine whether trail use was related to physical activity and sedentary behavior. Overall, statistically significant positive associations were found between trail use and physical activity. Trail use was associated with about 28 minutes of moderate physical activity per day compared to no trail use. On-trail vigorous physical activity minutes increased by 346 %, based on accelerometer and GPS data compared to <b>accelerometer</b> <b>counts</b> only. This trail study provided evidence that adults engaged in more physical activity when they use trails. In addition, this study indicated that the use of both accelerometer and GPS data may be a useful method for classifying intensity of physical activity occurring trails; particularly facilities where bicycling is a common activity.

40|$|Accelerometers for {{movement}} registrationhave {{the potential to}} reflect the volume,pattern, intensity, type, and energyexpenditure of physical activity(1, 2). Developments are still ongoing with regard to reduction {{of the size of}} the instruments, lengthening of battery life and translation of the output to meaningful information for the user. Instruments with the capacity for most or all functions mentioned are tri-axial and mounted on a waist belt. Krishnaveni, et al.

40|$|Overweight among {{preschool}} age {{children has}} increased {{at a rapid}} rate and is becoming a worldwide epidemic. Previous research suggests that overweight children are less active and have poorer motor skills than children of normal weight. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess motor skill and physical activity in low-income overweight and normal weight preschool children (ages 3 [...] 5 years) and determine the influence, if any, preschool activity policy had on children 2 ̆ 7 s activity levels.;Data were collected at low-income preschool centers (n = 5) in the state of Iowa. Children (n = 77) ages three to four years were included in the sample. A sub sample was created of normal weight (n = 21) and overweight (n = 25) children based on CDC BMI percentile. Assessment of body composition (skinfold measurements), physical activity levels (<b>accelerometer</b> <b>counts</b> and observed intensity) and motor skill competency (TGMD- 2 process assessment and outcome measures) were completed with the sub sample. The preschool center 2 ̆ 7 s physical activity policy was also reviewed using a policy checklist and teacher interviews.;One-way ANOVA 2 ̆ 7 s for BMI classified weight groups and gender failed to produce significant results for physical activity and motor skill variables. Trends were found in <b>accelerometer</b> <b>counts</b> when groups were based on sum of skinfold measurements rather than BMI. The correlation between BMI percentile and sum of skinfolds was low (r(46) =. 42, p =. 004) and suggested that over one-third of the children were placed in the wrong weight group (inconsistently classified). Trends were also found in <b>accelerometer</b> <b>counts,</b> observed intensity levels and locomotor TGMD- 2 scores when groups were based on agreement between BMI percentile and sum of skinfold. These trends showed small shifts in confidence intervals between groups and small effect sizes. Generally, overweight preschool children appear to have the same activity levels and motor skill proficiency as their normal weight peers as determined by small effect sizes and confidence intervals. Of the inconsistently classified children, those who had high BMI 2 ̆ 7 s and low sum of skinfolds were better at locomotor skills that involved power (i. e. run, leap, throw, kick) when compare to children with low BMI 2 ̆ 7 s and high sum of skinfolds. There was little variability in the preschool activity policies, and the strength of preschool policy had no effect on children 2 ̆ 7 s activity levels or motor skills. Based on these finding, BMI may lack validity as a means of classifying obesity in young children...|$|R
40|$|In the European Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study (EPIC), {{physical}} activity (PA) has been indexed as a cross-tabulation between PA {{at work and}} recreational activity. As the proportion of non-working participants increases, other categorization strategies are needed. Therefore, {{our aim was to}} develop a valid PA index for this population, which will also be able to express PA continuously. In the German EPIC centers Potsdam and Heidelberg, a clustered sample of 3, 766 participants was re-invited to the study center. 1, 615 participants agreed to participate and 1, 344 participants were finally included in this study. PA was measured by questionnaires on defined activities and a 7 -day combined heart rate and acceleration sensor. In a training sample of 433 participants, the Improved Physical Activity Index (IPAI) was developed. Its performance was evaluated in a validation sample of 911 participants and compared with the Cambridge Index and the Total PA Index. The IPAI consists of items covering five areas including PA at work, sport, cycling, television viewing, and computer use. The correlations of the IPAI with <b>accelerometer</b> <b>counts</b> in the training and validation sample ranged r = 0. 40 – 0. 43 and with {{physical activity}} energy expenditure (PAEE) r = 0. 33 – 0. 40 and were higher than for the Cambridge Index and the Total PA Index previously applied in EPIC. In non-working participants the IPAI showed higher correlations than the Cambridge Index and the Total PA Index, with r = 0. 34 for <b>accelerometer</b> <b>counts</b> and r = 0. 29 for PAEE. In conclusion, we developed a valid physical activity index which is able to express PA continuously as well as to categorize participant...|$|R
40|$|This study compares {{estimated}} {{energy expenditure}} (EE) from four equations using <b>accelerometer</b> <b>counts</b> in Zumba, interval 4 x 4 spinning, interval 4 x 4 running and pyramid running. The study also characterizes differences in EE and <b>accelerometer</b> <b>counts</b> during activity and recovery periods for these activities. Twenty six {{men and women}} (21. 8 ± 2. 4 years) completed four training sessions. Vector magnitude counts along three axes were measured using ActiGraph GT 3 X accelerometers. EE was estimated using four equations. Results show that EE varied by 34. 2 %, 19. 7 %, 18. 0 % and 20. 0 % depending on which equation was used in Zumba, 4 x 4 running, 4 x 4 spinning and pyramid running, respectively (p< 0. 001). Compared with 4 x 4 running, Zumba had 22. 0 % lower EE and 4 x 4 spinning had 47. 8 % lower EE in kcal/min (p< 0. 0001). There {{was no significant difference}} in EE between 4 x 4 running and pyramid running. The mean VM/min (vector magnitude counts per min) for Zumba was 22. 1 % and 20. 4 % lower than for 4 x 4 running and pyramid running, respectively (p< 0. 0001). An 85. 3 % higher VM/min was found in 4 x 4 running compared to 4 x 4 spinning (p< 0. 0001). The various equations caused substantial differences in the estimation of EE, particularly in Zumba, which is explained. Interval running provided the highest EE and counts/min. When 4 x 4 spinning was carried out both in sitting and standing positions, the underestimation in EE from accelerometer was about 50 % compared with 4 x 4 running...|$|R
40|$|Sedentary {{behavior}} {{is associated with}} overweight and obesity in children, and distance to school has been negatively associated with active commuting to school. It is not known how distance to school relates to sedentary behavior in children. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the association between distance to school and children’s sedentary behavior during weekdays at times where children interact with the neighborhood environ-ment. Children (5 – 13 years, n= 295) who participated in the understanding relationships between activity and neighborhoods study (2008 – 2010) across four New Zealand cities wore a hip-mounted accelerometer for 7 days.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} these {{experiments}} {{was to develop a}} rating-of-fatigue (ROF) scale capable of tracking the intensity of perceived fatigue in a variety of contexts. Methods: Four experiments were carried out. The first provided the evidential basis for the construction of the ROF scale. The second tested the face validity of the ROF, and the third tested the convergent and divergent validity of the ROF scale during ramped cycling to exhaustion and 30 min of resting recovery. The final experiment tested the convergent validity of the ROF scale with time of day and physical activity (<b>accelerometer</b> <b>counts)</b> across a whole week. Results: Modal selections of descriptions and diagrams at different levels of exertion and recovery were found during Experiment 1 upon which the ROF scale was constructed and finalised. In Experiment 2, a high level of face validity was indicated, in that ROF was reported to represent fatigue rather than exertion. Descriptor and diagrammatic elements of ROF reportedly added to the coherence and ease of use of the scale. In Experiment 3, high convergence between ROF and various physiological measures were found during exercise and recovery (heart rate, blood lactate concentration, oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide production, respiratory exchange ratio and ventilation rate were all P < 0. 001). During ramped cycling to exhaustion ROF and RPE did correspond (P < 0. 0001) but not during recovery, demonstrating discriminant validity. Experiment 4 found ROF to correspond with waking time during each day (Mon–Sun all P < 0. 0001) and with physical activity (<b>accelerometer</b> <b>count)</b> (Mon–Sun all P < 0. 001). Conclusions: The ROF scale has good face validity and high levels of convergent validity during ramped cycling to exhaustion, resting recovery and daily living activities. The ROF scale has both theoretical and applied potential in understanding changes in fatigue in a variety of contexts...|$|R
