40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} job search related behaviors of participants and non-participants of the 1995 Career Services Junior Meetings at Ball State University. The project also provides a portrait of the job-search behaviors of seniors at Ball State University. A sample of 344 seniors at Ball State University during the academic year of 1995 - 1996 was surveyed during March, obtained on 12 of the 26 variables from the Career Services Candidate Data Base. For the remaining 14 variables a survey instrument was used to obtain the data. One hundred eighty-three (183) usable responses were received for a useable response rate of 53. 2 %. Over 50. 0 % of the students were registered with Career Services and of those who were registered, 70. 9 % had registered at least six months before their graduation. Two percent of those surveyed had attended a Career Services workshop and 11. 0 % had attended a Job Search Seminar. Twenty three percent had been advised on the telephone by someone in Career Services, 6. 1 % had been advised during drop-in advising, 1. 2 % had been advised during individual advising, and 0. 9 % had been advised during a practice interview. Over 55 % of sample had conducted an informational interview with someone employed in their chosen profession. Nearly 38 % had attended <b>Career</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Day</b> in the Fall of 1995, 11. 6 % had attended the Summer Job Fair in the Spring of 1996, and 16. 9 % had participated in On-Campus Interviewing. Seventy-seven percent of the respondents had used the Career Resource Center more than once, 20. 8 % used the career or job-search resources in Bracken Library, and 14. 8 % accessed Career Services' home page on the World Wide Web. Over 72 % of the sample had work experience related to their career choice since they had been in college. Over 55 % of the respondants had interviewed at least once for professional employment related to their career choice and 27. 9 % had interviewed three or more times. Slightly more than 28 % had received an offer for professional employment and 18. 6 % had accepted an offer for professional employment. Nearly 83 % had identified a major influence that affected their career choice with a teacher/professor (11. 9 %), interest in the field (11. 9 %), family member (10. 3 %), and availability of employment (7. 6 %) being the top four items identified.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to propose a {{framework}} on <b>career</b> <b>information</b> management and guidance system for supporting career decision making of individuals through providing relevant <b>career</b> <b>information</b> and recommending suitable training courses based on ones’ personal particulars. Mixed research method is employed and both quantitative and qualitative surveys were conducted to collect user requirements and opinions with regard to the difficulties in locating relevant <b>career</b> <b>information.</b> Five interviews with purposefully selected training institutions in Hong Kong were conducted to explore the system requirements for career planning and guidance in particular for on-the-job training and retraining. On the other hand, 25 completed questionnaires from the workforce were collected with regard to their <b>career</b> <b>information</b> needs, as well as their perception on <b>career</b> <b>information</b> management and guidance system. The findings showed that the degrees of subject knowledge and ages of the users affect their information seeking behaviours and thus the requirements of the system. Although figures show that there might be a negative relationship between household income levels and training decisions, this relationship is not statistically significant. Furthermore, three underlying factors affecting individuals’ career decisions had been identified. They are (i) opinions from others; (ii) personalities, affections andabilities; and (iii) career plan and resources. The four factors influencing trainingdecisions are: (i) information perceived; (ii) physical constraints; (iii) affections; and (iv) resources. Based on the survey results, a framework of <b>Career</b> <b>Information</b> Management and Guidance System (CIMGS) backboned with Information Feeding (IF) model was proposed. The findings of this study will provide an insight to researchers on the application of information and communication technology such as social media tools and vocational guidance services on an internet-based self-administered <b>career</b> <b>information</b> management and guidance system. published_or_final_versionLibrary and Information ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Library and Information Managemen...|$|R
