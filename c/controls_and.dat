The problem of providing concurrency <b>control</b> <b>and</b> recovery in objectbases supporting nested transactions is analyzed and types of static information which are useful to concurrency <b>control</b> <b>and</b> recovery are determined. Algorithms are proposed to derive the needed static information. The problem of concurrency control in objectbases is decomposed into two simpler problems: intra-transaction concurency <b>control</b> <b>and</b> inter-transaction concurrency <b>control</b> <b>and</b> algorithms are developed for each. A novel concurrency control algorithm combining the algorithms for intra- <b>and</b> inter-transaction concurrency <b>control</b> which specifies serialization orders ` a priori is presented.
