5|$|Yellow tea: This tea is {{processed}} {{in a similar}} manner to green tea, but instead of immediate drying after fixation, it is stacked, <b>covered,</b> <b>and</b> gently heated in a humid environment. This initiates oxidation in the chlorophyll of the leaves through non-enzymatic and non-microbial means, which results in a yellowish or greenish-yellow colour.|$|E
5|$|Economists {{have found}} {{empirical}} evidence that covered interest rate parity generally holds, though not with precision {{due to the}} effects of various risks, costs, taxation, and ultimate differences in liquidity. When both <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> uncovered interest rate parity hold, they expose a relationship suggesting that the forward rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate. This relationship can be employed to test whether uncovered interest rate parity holds, for which economists have found mixed results. When uncovered interest rate parity and purchasing power parity hold together, they illuminate a relationship named real interest rate parity, which suggests that expected real interest rates represent expected adjustments in the real exchange rate. This relationship generally holds strongly over longer terms and among emerging market countries.|$|E

30|$|In the pre-monsoon season, the {{regression}} analysis of temperature over forest <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> vegetation shows regression coefficient values of 0.6876 and 0.5751, respectively. However, regression analysis of rainfall over forest <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> vegetation shows regression coefficient value of 0.0875 and 0.3459, respectively.

5|$|Evidence of {{the effect}} of the Reformation was seen in early 1524. Candlemas was not celebrated, processions of robed clergy ceased, worshippers did not go with palms or relics on Palm Sunday to the Lindenhof, and triptychs {{remained}} <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> closed after Lent. Opposition to the changes came from Konrad Hofmann and his followers, but the council decided in favour of keeping the government mandates. When Hofmann left the city, opposition from pastors hostile to the Reformation broke down. The bishop of Constance tried to intervene in defending the mass and the veneration of images. Zwingli wrote an official response for the council and the result was the severance of all ties between the city and the diocese.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, the xx {{released}} their self-titled {{debut album}} to critical acclaim. It was certified platinum in the United Kingdom and also sold 350,000 copies in the United States. It showcased their characteristically moody, R and post-dubstep-influenced indie pop style and lyrical themes of loneliness, lust, and love. After {{the departure of}} group member Baria Qureshi, the xx exclusively played live concerts throughout 2010, including several high-profile summer music festivals, and garnered a growing fanbase. The band's popularity grew further when their songs featured in television shows and commercials, and they were also <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> sampled by well-known recording artists. In 2010, their debut album won the Mercury Prize, an annual music prize awarded for the best record from the UK and Ireland.|$|E
40|$|The common {{confusion}} of land <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> land use in many datasets is problematic for many data integration activities. This paper proposes an approach for {{the separation of}} land <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> land use based on data primitives.

5|$|Medieval {{construction}} was seasonal, work on site being undertaken {{only in the}} spring and summer, when the light was good and the weather more reliable. Each autumn, all exposed surfaces were <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> lagged against frost damage. The architects worked over winter in the tracing house (that of York has both a fireplace and a privy) to prepare designs for the next season's campaign. They translated the designs into sets of planed oak cross-sectional templates, which were given to the stone-cutters. Construction of cathedrals and major churches almost invariably started at the eastern arm, and then proceeded westwards, with towers erected last.|$|E

40|$|Land <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> {{land use}} data present {{information}} about the physical coverage of the earth surface (land <b>cover)</b> <b>and</b> its socio-economic purpose (land use).

5|$|In December 2013, Burger King {{returned}} to Finland after {{three decades of}} absence. The first restaurant, located on Mannerheimintie in central Helsinki, instantly proved so popular that for every day since its opening, people have had to queue {{in front of the}} restaurant to get in, sometimes for over half an hour. The only exception so far has been Christmas time, when the restaurant was closed. According to Mikko Molberg, the leader of the Finnish Burger King franchise, the restaurant has attracted over 2000 customers on every single day, which has surprised the restaurant employees and the franchise owners. The long queues have been extensively <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> ridiculed in social media, comparing them to people queuing in front of a McDonald's restaurant in Moscow, Russia in the early 1990s, and contrasting them with the nearly nonexistent queues to Burger King restaurants in Stockholm, Sweden.|$|E

5|$|The skull was {{structured}} {{in such a}} way that as it closed, the bones holding the teeth in the upper jaw would bow out. This would cause the lower surfaces of the upper jaw teeth to rub against the upper surface of the lower jaw's teeth, grinding anything caught in between and providing an action that is the rough equivalent of mammalian chewing. Because the teeth were always replaced, the animal could have used this mechanism throughout its life, and could eat tough plant material. Additionally, the front ends of the animal's jaws were toothless and tipped with bony nodes, both upper and lower, providing a rough margin that was likely <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> lengthened by a keratinous material to form a cropping beak for biting off twigs and shoots. Its food gathering would have been aided by its flexible little finger, which could have been used to manipulate objects, unlike the other fingers.|$|E
5|$|Flooding was {{considered}} worst in Puebla, {{and were the}} worst floods in about 400years, according to newspaper reports. A total of 21,342people evacuated their houses to 116shelters, mostly in the state's northern portion. The floods affected 16,511houses and 199schools. In TeziutlÃ¡n, {{with a population of}} about 50,000, it is estimated the city received nearly half of its annual rainfall in about three days. Nine entire communities became isolated due to the floods, and the small village of Patla sustained heavy damage after the Necaxa River changed its course closer to the town. Widespread landslides occurred, including over 80 in TeziutlÃ¡n alone; one mudslide there destroyed 80houses. Some of the landslides occurred along rivers and produced new lakes, but 85% of these broke within the first year. Population growth, primarily in TeziutlÃ¡n and Zaragoza, occurred in landslide-prone areas along mountains. Along Sierra Norte de Puebla, deforestation contributed to additional landslides. A landslide covered the Zacatepec River near Zempoala, creating a natural dam and a small lake. Mudslides buried at least 16people at a school in Pantepec, and a deforested hill caused a landslide in the Indigenous village of Acalama, which covered up to 170people. Most had fled to a church that was also <b>covered,</b> <b>and</b> it is estimated that only 30people survived in the village. Statewide, 263people were killed, including 107 in TeziutlÃ¡n who were buried by mudslides, becoming the worst disaster {{in the history of the}} town.

40|$|Canopy {{structural}} parameters {{are often used}} to give adequate representation of vegetated ecosystems for various purposes including primary productivity, climate system, water and carbon gas exchanges, and radiation extinction. Canopy {{structural parameters}} are usually described using several pseudo-synonymous terms, often measuring different components of vegetation canopies. Standardization in the definitions has fallen short, leading to confusion of terms even in standard text books making the comparison of historic measures futile. Here we clarify concepts {{that have been used}} for fractional canopy element <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> openness measures. The fractional canopy element <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> openness concepts considered are canopy closure, canopy cover, canopy openness, crown closure, crown completeness, crown cover, crown porosity, site openness and tilt openness. New methodologies are presented to obtain large scale fractional canopy element <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> openness measures using hemispherical photography. The new methodologies and variations in definitions of fractional canopy element <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> openness concepts are demonstrated using photographic measurements in complex topography. The results indicate that both fractional canopy element <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> openness parameters can be estimated with a few point-based measurements using hemispherical photography. Hemispherical photography is therefore less time, labour and resource intensive, as compared to point based measuring techniques of canopy element <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> openness.
