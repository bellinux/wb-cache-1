5000|$|The {{complete}} {{removal of the}} floor-boarding in Sir Thomas Stepney’s Study revealed that there was in fact two parallel north to south aligned <b>cross</b> <b>walls,</b> <b>partitioned</b> by a further east to west cross wall. Each of {{the tops of the}} walls was surmounted by wooden planks, which were themselves supporting the existing oak floor joists. Groundwork for a series of three proposed north-south floor support channels, through the 0.9 m deep demolition deposit below the existing floor, exposed the remains of another stone pitched or cobbled floor surface, which appeared to cover almost the entire area of the room. At the far southern end of this room further excavation revealed that the short <b>partition</b> <b>wall,</b> which divided the two stone cross walls, was in fact the remains of a low basement area, which appeared to have been retained when the floor level had been raised in this room. Former access to this low basement or storage room appears to have been gained through an opening at the far south-western corner of the room via a flight of stone steps also exposed during excavations. Dateable material recovered from the apparent 3 ft deep demolition deposit from this room included three clay pipe tobacco bowls, each dateable to between 1660-1680, several large fragments of 17th-century decorative plasterwork and an almost completely intact tall necked octagonal green glass wine bottle dated to between 1660-1700.|$|R

40|$|The growing {{necessity}} to save material and energy resources, {{together with a}} growing concern over the environmental issues, are impelling to solutions that present a minimal expression of the materials and products used. This is particularly relevant to the interior <b>partition</b> <b>walls</b> that have a high contribution to {{the environmental impact of}} buildings, although these elements are easily reducible. Another aspect is that a great portion of housing designs are not flexible in use and therefore they are not suitably adjustable to the permanent updating of life-styles and variations on the composition of the households. Although there are some lightweight building technologies, in most cases the construction practice in Portugal makes use of heavyweight and static <b>partition</b> <b>walls.</b> This problem reveals to be of particularly importance in the refurbishment phase of existing buildings, but also when it is necessary the rethink of the interior spaces in the operation phase. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyse the environmental, functional and economical performances of a conceptual lightweight sandwich membrane <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> and to compare it with two technologies: i) the heavyweight conventional <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> (hollow brick wall); and ii) the lightweight reference gypsum panels wall (plasterboard wall). This paper will be focused in the advantages of the lightweight <b>partition</b> <b>walls</b> and may contribute for the development of new <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> technologies. The comparative evaluation of these solutions will be based on a standard Life-cycle Assessment method. A lightweight interior <b>partition</b> <b>walls</b> is certainly a wiser option in many situations as it can be more flexible and even portable, in some cases, as well as having a lower environmental impact in a Life-cycle Assessment (LCA), as it will be demonstrated in this paper. The lower quantity of materials used in lightweight solutions allow a lower specific embodied energy and other more favourable environmental impact indicators. The reduction of material inputs to the minimum is a way to achieve higher eco-efficiency in a building and thus open the road to more efficient interior partition systems...|$|R

The gas-to-gas micro heat exchangers differ by <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> material, <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> thickness and flow arrangement. The pressure drop behavior has been analyzed due to the pressure losses in different sections of the gas-to-gas micro heat exchangers. Increased pressure losses in front of and behind the micro channels have been detected due to modified geometries in the inlet and outlet distribution chambers. The heat transfer performance has been determined in terms of thermal effectiveness. The comparison among different <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> materials and <b>partition</b> <b>wall</b> thicknesses showed no significant criteria {{of the influence of}} thermal conductivity on the thermal effectiveness. An assessment due to an overall heat exchanger effectiveness has been performed to compare the gas-to-gas micro heat exchangers.
