25|$|In 2008–09, Staal {{improved}} his offensive output to 15 points, scoring three goals and adding 12 assists, all career highs. He {{returned to the}} YoungStars Competition as a sophomore at the 2009 NHL All-Star Game in Montreal, and scored two goals. Late in the season, a coaching change led to a more offensive philosophy designed to propel the Rangers into the playoffs. The defensive-minded Tom Renney was replaced by John Tortorella, who encouraged more offence from all of his players, including Staal. As a result, much of Staal's production <b>came</b> <b>toward</b> {{the end of the}} season; 6 of his 15 points came after the coaching change, in just 21 games (as opposed to nine in 61 under Renney). The Rangers would again qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs on the strength of their strong finish, but this time were defeated in the first round by the Washington Capitals in seven games after blowing a 3–1 series lead. During the series, Staal would record his second career NHL playoff goal.|$|E

500|$|Agnew had a {{successful}} first-class career as a fast bowler for Leicestershire from 1979 to 1990, returning briefly in 1992. In first-class cricket he took 666 wickets {{at an average of}} 29.25. [...] Agnew won three Test caps for England, as well as playing three One Day Internationals in the mid-1980s, although his entire international career lasted just under a year. In county cricket, Agnew's most successful seasons <b>came</b> <b>toward</b> the end of his career, after his last international match, when he had learned to swing the ball. He was second- and third-leading wicket-taker in 1987 and 1988 respectively, including the achievement of 100 wickets in a season in 1987. He was named as one of the five Cricketers of the Year by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 1988.|$|E
500|$|Rit {{struggled}} to keep her family together as slavery threatened to tear it apart. Edward Brodess sold three of her daughters (Linah, Mariah Ritty, and Soph), separating them from the family forever. When a trader from Georgia approached Brodess about buying Rit's youngest son, Moses, she hid him for a month, aided by other slaves and free blacks in the community. At one point she confronted her owner about the sale. Finally, Brodess and [...] "the Georgia man" [...] <b>came</b> <b>toward</b> the slave quarters to seize the child, where Rit told them, [...] "You are after my son; but the first man that comes into my house, I will split his head open." [...] Brodess backed away and abandoned the sale. Tubman's biographers agree that stories told about this event within the family influenced her belief in the possibilities of resistance.|$|E
500|$|Corwin Jones {{was arrested}} on May 10, 2008, {{at the age of}} 19 in LaSalle Parish on a charge of {{misdemeanor}} simple battery. The Sheriff's Department alleges that three days earlier, Jones had struck a man from behind as several people, including Jones, <b>came</b> <b>toward</b> the man and his friends, with Jones' companions carrying baseball bats. Jones denied fault, saying that the incident was caused by a fight the previous day in which Jones says he was not involved, that he had been harassed and intimidated, and [...] "that the incident that day 'struck a nerve and I reacted'." [...] Jones had previously been arrested on January 24, 2008, on a trespass-related charge. According to his father, Jones received his diploma from Jena High School because he had completed his school work before his arrest. He moved out of Jena and was working in a hotel.|$|E

500|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 July, St. Clair decided to {{withdraw}} the men occupying the defence post at Mount Hope, which was exposed and subject to capture. [...] The detachment there {{set fire to the}} works and retreated to the old French lines (so called because they were the site of the French defence in the 1758 Battle of Carillon), getting away not long before the arrival of Burgoyne's advance guard. [...] That afternoon, a company of British soldiers and Indians <b>came</b> <b>toward</b> those lines, but not near enough to do significant damage, and opened fire. [...] St. Clair ordered his men to hold their fire until the enemy was closer, but James Wilkinson fired at a British soldier, spurring the untrained defenders to follow suit. [...] The soldier Wilkinson fired at fell, and the British troops fled. [...] When the man was captured, it turned out he was uninjured, and that he had fallen down because he was drunk. [...] Through the deception of placing him with a man posing as a captured Loyalist, St. Clair learned the nature of the opposing forces.|$|E
500|$|As usual, the Earps {{carried their}} revolvers in their coat pockets {{or in their}} waistbands. Wyatt Earp was {{carrying}} a [...]44 caliber American 1869 Smith & Wesson revolver.

The Earps and Holliday walked west, down {{the south side of}} Fremont Street past the rear entrance to the O.K. Corral, but out of visual range of the Cowboys' last reported location. Near the corner of Fourth St. and Fremont St., the Earps ran into Sheriff Behan. He had left the Cowboys and <b>came</b> <b>toward</b> them, though he looked nervously backward several times. Virgil testified afterward that Behan told them, [...] "For God's sake, don't go down there or they will murder you!" [...] Wyatt said Behan told him and Morgan, [...] "I have disarmed them." [...] Behan testified afterward that he'd only said he'd gone down to the Cowboys [...] "for the purpose of disarming them," [...] not that he'd actually disarmed them. One eye witness, laundryman Peter H. Fallehy, wrote in his testimony afterward that Virgil Earp told Behan, [...] "those men have made their threats and I will not arrest them but I will kill them on sight." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout 1989 the Orb, {{along with}} Martin Glover, {{developed}} a music production style that incorporated ambient {{music with a}} diverse array of samples and recordings. The British music press later labelled the music ambient house. The culmination of the group's musical work <b>came</b> <b>toward</b> {{the end of the}} same year when they recorded a session for John Peel on BBC Radio 1. The track, then known as [...] "Loving You," [...] was largely improvisational and featured a wealth of sound effects and samples from science fiction radio plays, nature sounds, and Minnie Riperton's [...] "Lovin' You." [...] For its release as a single on the record label Big Life, the Orb changed the title to [...] "A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules from the Centre of the Ultraworld." [...] Upon the single's release, Riperton's management forced Big Life to remove the unlicensed Riperton sample, ensuring that only the initial first-week release of the single contained the original vocals of Minnie Riperton; subsequent pressings used vocals from a sound-alike. Despite its running time of 22 minutes, the sample-laden single reached #78 on the British singles charts. Soon thereafter, the Orb were commissioned by Dave Stewart to remix his top-20 single [...] "Lily Was Here." [...] The group obliged and were soon offered several more remix jobs from artists including Erasure and System 7.|$|E
