40|$|The degree {{project at}} hand investigates how {{large areas of}} older forest (80 plus years) {{suitable}} for clear cutting there is on the Swedish island of Gotland. Large areas of older forest on Gotland are situated on land with shallow soil depths which are economically uninteresting and often unsuitable for clear <b>cutting</b> <b>forestry.</b> Other forests hold big nature conservation values and should not, or cannot, be used for forestry purposes. The survey is made as a GIS analysis based on the old but carefully made “Brief forest inventory” (ÖSI) made in the 1980 s and early 1990 s. A sample from the inventory is combined with studies of orthophotos, satellite photos and other GIS layers that display estimated soil depth and nature conservation values. Partly contrary to common belief, the survey shows {{that there are still}} large areas of older forest suitable for clear <b>cutting</b> <b>forestry</b> on the island. However, the numbers presented are significantly lower than those presented by the Swedish National Forest Inventory...|$|E

40|$|Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) {{in southeastern}} British Columbia feed mainly on {{arboreal}} lichens in winter. Some modified forestry practices {{that have been}} used or proposed for caribou ranges are reviewed. Partial cutting results in the retention of some forage lichens. Partial cutting and small patch harvesting may improve lichen growth on the remaining trees. Retention of advanced regeneration and some residual trees may improve lichen growth in the remaining stand. Extension of the rotation age increases the amount of harvestable forest useful to caribou at any one time. Progressive cutting minimizes road access to caribou ranges, and may be combined with partial <b>cutting.</b> Most <b>forestry</b> practices intended to maintain lichen production will result in increased human activity in caribou ranges, unless road access is controlled. The management strategy selected depends on site conditions and on the relative importance assigned to the impact of habitat alteration and human activity on caribou...|$|R
25|$|They {{made their}} living with {{semi-nomadic}} shepherding, selling lambs and wool {{and using the}} milk to make various dairy products, particularly cheese. Pastures and meadows were used as hay fields and in autumn, for grazing. However, for grazing in winter, they migrated to southern Istria. Farming covered personal needs, mostly potato, cabbage, beans, beet and less wheat, barley, oat and corn. Substantial income was acquired from <b>forestry,</b> <b>cutting</b> firewood, logging transported by draft horses and most often making k(a)rbunica, a wood pile covered with soil, producing charcoal. After 1945, agriculture and forestry weren't enough to maintain living standards.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The article {{presents}} {{a survey of}} sensors relevant for mobile robot navigation and their sensing principles. The sensors surveyed include range sensors, inertial systems and positioning systems. There are many applications, from different sectors that could profit from this type of technology: autonomous mobile platforms for materials handling in industry, warehouses, hospitals, etc.; <b>forestry</b> <b>cutting</b> and undergrowth management equipment; autonomous fire-fighting machines; mining machinery; advanced electrical wheel chairs; autonomous cleaning machines; security and surveillance robots. Advanced sensor systems which are now emerging in different activities from the health care services to the transportation sector and domestic services, will significantly increase the capabilities of autonomous vehicles and will enlarge their application potential. 1...|$|R
2500|$|Mario Javier Fernandez-Vega is a Puerto Rican {{forester}} {{who uses}} silvicultural techniques. Fernandez is currently developing <b>cutting</b> edge <b>forestry</b> methods {{known as the}} [...] "Borincano Model". The model capitalizes on the diversity of ecological niches in Puerto Rican forests and native disturbance regimes to formulate practices uniquely suited to the forests of the territory. About his model Fernandez {{has been known to}} comment, [...] "Soy de aquí como el coquí" [...] I am from here just like the coqui, a common patriotic axiom that is used to demonstrate their native ties to the island. It should be noted, although incorrect, many believe that the Coqui and its unique vocalizations are indigenous to the island of Puerto Rico. In fact however, there are thriving populations of Coquis that, like the people of Puerto Rico, have been transported to the island of Hawaii. Sadly, the Coqui a source of pride to its people, is viewed as an ecological menace in Hawaii where its song of co kee co kee is found to be an irritant by many. Needless to say that efforts to eradicate its presence in Hawaii is not a popular issue among Puerto Ricans.|$|R
40|$|Mechanized {{equipment}} for forest operations provide better operator protection in this hazardous work environment. However operators of <b>forestry</b> <b>cutting</b> machines are now exposed to new hazards from the high-energy cutting devices used to cut trees and process logs. Anecdotal reports of thrown objects document {{a risk of}} injury and fatality. Two new ISO standards have been developed after a program of basic research by both US and Swedish research organizations. The chainshot hazard may be reduced by implementation of guarding systems that block or divert broken chains. Failed sawteeth are difficult to block at the cutting device and a new standard for protective cab glazing {{may be the most}} effective approach. This report describes the research tests and development of the new standards...|$|R
50|$|As the Forest Service {{increased}} timber harvest, including clearcutting, in the Bitterroots, many in {{the local}} community became concerned about the aesthetic and environmental impacts. They turned to Brandborg for help. In {{what is known as}} the “Bitterroot Controversy”, he and others challenged the Forest Service through the Bitterroot Resource Conservation and Development program. Under this pressure, the Forest Service responded by contracting a third party—the School of Forestry at the University of Montana—to study the problem. The resulting report found that timber production in the Bitterroots was taking place without consideration of the effects on environment, economy, and aesthetics of the area. It also took a close look at the problems that stem from clear <b>cutting</b> and from <b>forestry</b> management decisions that lack local participation. Although disputes over forestry practices continue, this event sparked major changes to U.S. forestry policies in the 1970s and influenced the passage of the National Forest Management Act of 1976.|$|R
6000|$|He {{was a man}} of one idea:—that all {{civilisation}} was {{the painted}} fungus of rottenness. He hated any sign of culture. I won his respect one afternoon when he found me trespassing in the woods because I was watching some maggots at work in a dead rabbit. That led us to a discussion of life. He was a thorough materialist—he scorned religion and all mysticism. He spent his days sleeping, making intricate traps for weasels and men, putting together a gun, or doing some amateur <b>forestry,</b> <b>cutting</b> down timber, splitting it in logs for use in the hall, and planting young trees. When he thought, he reflected on the decay of mankind—the decline of the human race into folly and weakness and rottenness. [...] "Be a good animal, true to your animal instinct," [...] was his motto. With all this, he was fundamentally very unhappy—and he made me also wretched. It was this power to communicate his unhappiness that made me somewhat dear to him, I think. He treated me as an affectionate father treats a delicate son; I noticed he liked to {{put his hand on my}} shoulder or my knee as we talked; yet withal, he asked me questions, and saved his thoughts to tell me, and believed in my knowledge like any acolyte.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the bioenergy sector {{has led to an}} increasing interest in energy crops. Short rotation coppices (SRC) are forestry management systems in which fast-growing tree species are produced under intensive cultivation practices to obtain high wood chips yields. In Italy, most SRC plantations consist of poplar biomass-clones. SRC plantations can be carried out with different management systems with diverse cutting times; consequently, the cultivation system can be crucial for attaining high yields depending on: i) short and ii) medium cutting frequency. Nowadays, the larger part of Italian SRC is based on 2 -year <b>cutting</b> short rotation <b>forestry</b> (SRF) but the best quality of wood chips is linked to 5 -year plantation medium rotation forestry (MRF). This work compares an SRF and an MRF poplar plantation located in the Po Valley in northern Italy. In particular, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was carried out to evaluate their energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. The LCA software SimaPro 7. 10 was used to create the LCA model and to assure an accurate impact assessment calculation. The analysis shows several differences between MRF and SRF in terms of fertiliser requirements and intensive agricultural activities. Results highlight that MRF produces a more sustainable wood chip production than SRF according to energy and environmental concerns. Furthermore, hot spots were identified in both SRF and MRF due to the high energy consumption and the related emissions. These hot spots were: i) mineral fertilisation; ii) mechanical weed-control; iii) harvesting and biomass transport...|$|R
40|$|The {{rare and}} elusive wood-living beetle Tragosoma depsarium, once {{widespread}} all over Sweden, {{is associated with}} large, sun-exposed pine logs required for breeding. Due to modern forestry and fire suppression, this type of substrate has become so rare in the landscape that the beetles’ existence in Sweden is threatened. Recently, the female sex pheromone of this species was synthesised, providing a new method to monitor beetle populations using pheromone traps. Such a method {{was used in the}} current study to relate the presence-absence of T. depsarium with different landscape variables at different scales; 100, 500, 1000 and 2000 meters, respectively. The occurrence of T. depsarium in Östergötland County was associated with the amount of protected areas and clear-cuts at 500 and 1000 meters, respectively. Additionally, the amount of pine forest within 2000 m from the trap showed a weak, positive effect on the number of beetles. In the whole south-east boreo-nemoral zone of Sweden, a positive correlation between beetle occurrence and protected areas were found at 2000 m together with a negative correlation for volume pine wood within 100 m. Also, emergence holes on pine logs around each trap were strongly associated with beetle occurrences. To conclude, using pheromone traps were an easy way of detecting beetles. Although the number of caught T. depsarium varied greatly over time, the sampling period matched the flight period well. For long-term survival of this beetle, the forests must contain breeding substrates and be opened up through prescribed burning, selective <b>cutting</b> and active <b>forestry...</b>|$|R
40|$|Today, native {{vegetation}} in the Valdivian Coastal Range (VCR) {{is restricted}} to areas where small-scale land use dominates resulting in a vegetation mosaic. This study (1) provides {{a description of the}} vegetation types (VT) within the vegetation mosaic, (2) identifies land use drivers that lead to either degradation or recovery processes and, (3) attempts to provide an explanation for the vegetation mosaic with a conceptual model. In two regions of the VCR we sampled 102 plots for composition of vegetation and indicators of livestock browsing, timber <b>cutting</b> and coppice <b>forestry.</b> We classified the vegetation using a flexible beta method and Bray-Curtis distance. Diagnostic species were identified by an extended indicator species analysis. The clustering results were visualized in NMDS and recursive partitioning was used to explain variations in the VTs {{as a function of the}} land use variables. Differentiating effects were tested using PERMANOVA and a conceptual model for the vegetation dynamics was developed from the results. Four VTs such as (1) extensively grazed non-native grasslands (EGN); (2), closed and semi-closed grazed Ugni and Berberis shrublands; (3) severely impacted evergreen forests; and (4) sparsely disturbed evergreen forests were recognized. The browsing indicators were important for differentiating the VTs. The EGN grasslands were differentiated by having more than 0. 075 dung piles/m 2. Areas with fewer dung piles but direct browsing effects had the greatest impact on vegetation. Forests were preserved when the mean browsing index was equal to or lower than 0. 5. The cutting frequency was significant in determining overall floristic composition. We showed that shrublands and evergreen forests within the vegetation mosaic and the result of small-scale farming led to high native forest species richness. This makes the vegetation mosaic especially valuable in a landscape dominated by exotic tree monocultures...|$|R
