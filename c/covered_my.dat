500|$|As {{his daughters}} {{approached}} womanhood, Liszt {{felt that a}} change in their lives was called for and in 1855 he arranged (over their mother's bitter protests) for them to move to Berlin. Here they {{were placed in the}} care of Franziska von Bülow, whose son Hans was Liszt's most outstanding pupil; he would take charge of the girls' musical education while Frau von Bülow supervised their general and moral welfare. Hans von Bülow, born in 1830, had abandoned his legal education after hearing Liszt conduct the premiere of Wagner's Lohengrin at Weimar in August 1850, and had decided to dedicate his life to music. After a brief spell conducting in small opera houses, Bülow studied with Liszt, who was convinced that he would become a great concert pianist. Bülow was quickly impressed by Cosima's own skill as a pianist, in which he saw the stamp of her father, and the pair developed romantic feelings for each other. Liszt approved the match, and the marriage took place at St. Hedwig's Cathedral, Berlin, on 18 August 1857. During their honeymoon, along with Liszt they visited Wagner at his home near Zurich. This visit was repeated the following year, when Cosima, on taking her leave, shocked Wagner with an emotional demonstration: [...] "he fell at my feet, <b>covered</b> <b>my</b> hands with tears and kisses ... I pondered the mystery, without being able to solve it".|$|E
2500|$|In July 1998, Wright {{moved to}} West Ham United for £500,000. He spent fifteen months as a West Ham player, scoring the winner on his debut against Sheffield Wednesday, without {{reaching}} the same form {{he had at}} Arsenal. During his spell there he made headlines when he vandalised the referee's dressing room at Upton Park after being sent off during a match against Leeds United. He had subsequent short spells at Nottingham Forest, Celtic, and Burnley (whom he helped to promotion to Division One) before retiring in 2000. Whilst at Celtic, Wright became involved in a campaign by some fans calling {{for the removal of}} manager, John Barnes. Celtic's performances had been poor. Wright, Barnes and Regi Blinker were considered by some to be not sufficiently talented to improve the club. Wright and Blinker were consequently abused by some Celtic fans. Wright said of the incidents, [...] "I felt I was caught up in a war crisis in Kosovo not involved in a football result that wrecked John Barnes' career as Celtic manager." [...] "Some so-called fans, a few morons who know nothing better, <b>covered</b> <b>my</b> car in spit, they were shouting obscenities at myself and Regi Blinker." [...] Wright scored on his debut for Celtic as he had for Nottingham Forest. He finished his club career with 313 goals in all competitions.|$|E
2500|$|According to Stephen Shore's [...] "Factory: Andy Warhol," [...] "Andy and I {{were hanging}} around together. I had an {{apartment}} on the Lower East Side, where I had haircutting salons. Hundreds of people would come, and I’d be cutting someone's hair. Andy came. When he first started making films, he made films about what a person was famous for," [...] Billy, whose real name was William Linich Jr., and {{was the son of}} a barber, recalled. [...] "I was famous for giving haircuts, so he said, [...] "Would you let me do a film of you doing haircuts?" [...] I had <b>covered</b> <b>my</b> entire apartment in silver foil and painted everything silver. Andy said, [...] "Well, I just got a new loft would you do to it what you’ve done to your apartment?" [...] I said, [...] "Oh, sure, let's do it." [...] So, I started doing it. I was a technician— I’d been a light designer for [...] the Judson Church. I also worked for some off-Broadway theater and avant-garde dance companies. I installed all the lighting at the Factory, all the sound systems." [...] In return for making over his loft, Warhol gave Name a new role within the Factory. [...] "I was into light and sound before, but not photography," [...] Name said. [...] "Andy had a still camera, but he had gotten the Bolex. He was going to start to do films, and he gave me the Pentax and said, [...] "Here, Billy, you do the still photography; I’m going to start making films." [...] I became the in-house photographer and was sort of like the foreman. Eventually I moved in." [...] Name and Warhol eventually became lovers, but the romantic aspect of their relationship slowly dissolved into mutual loyalty and admiration.|$|E

2500|$|... "Had it {{not been}} for the Tartars I would not be alive today. They were the nomads of the Crimea, in what was then no man's land between the Russian and German fronts, and favoured neither side. I had already struck up a good {{relationship}} with them, and often wandered off to sit with them. ‘Du nix njemcky’ they would say, ‘du Tartar,’ and try to persuade me to join their clan. Their nomadic ways attracted me of course, although by that time their movements had been restricted. Yet, it was they who discovered me in the snow after the crash, when the German search parties had given up. I was still unconscious then and only came round completely after twelve days or so, and by then I was back in a German field hospital. So the memories I have of that time are images that penetrated my consciousness. The last thing I remember was that it was too late to jump, too late for the parachutes to open. That must have been a couple of seconds before hitting the ground. Luckily I was not strapped in – I always preferred free movement to safety belts… My friend was strapped in and he was atomized on impact – there was almost nothing to be found of him afterwards. But I must have shot through the windscreen as it flew back at the same speed as the plane hit the ground and that saved me, though I had bad skull and jaw injuries. Then the tail flipped over and I was completely buried in the snow. That's how the Tartars found me days later. I remember voices saying ‘Voda’ (Water), then the felt of their tents, and the dense pungent smell of cheese, fat and milk. They <b>covered</b> <b>my</b> body in fat to help it regenerate warmth, and wrapped it in felt as an insulator to keep warmth in." ...|$|E
