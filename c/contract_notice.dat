40|$|Abstract:- In each {{civilisation}} {{public works}} express {{the ability of}} rulers to promote and realise their major goals {{in the field of}} both development policy and economic and social progress. Nowadays public works could be defined as infrastructure works covering basic social needs and contributing to GDP growth, national security and the improvement of the quality of life. In European level, in particular, they promote national and regional territorial cohesion, economic and social cohesion and competitiveness across EU regions. The paper focuses on the direct relation between public works and sustainability as the former could become an effective tool to implement the latter. This could be achieved mainly by the incorporation and establishment of environmental policy principles and rules in public works legislation. In this context, the paper presents the relevant institutional framework in Greece, taking into consideration legislative provisions and general principles introduced mainly by jurisprudence. Next, it proposes and analyses the concept of ecological public work as a principle combining sustainability, public works and the protection of the environment. The main idea of the aforementioned concept consists in apprehending public works as the key factor which shapes, protects and shows off the surrounding environment. Thus ecological technical features should be incorporated in technical specifications as defined in the contract documentation such as <b>contract</b> <b>notices,</b> <b>contract</b> documents, drawings or additional documents. Finally, the paper aims at promoting the principle of ecological public works principally in European doctrine in order to influence both the legislator and case law in relating sustainability to public works...|$|R

Many innovative contracting practices, described as public-private partnerships (PPP) take place using public contract proceedings. The operation of these proceedings does not fit neatly with the idea of partnership. This paper will address the following questions: What is partnership? How does partnership relate to PPP? What are the problems of public contract PPPs in relation to partnership? What drives actors on private markets? In what respects does the European public contracting directive not fit with relational contracting? How do public and private markets relate in urban development?
