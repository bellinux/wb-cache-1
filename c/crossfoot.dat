5000|$|... 1970s skate {{competitions}} such as {{the ones}} shown in Lords of Dogtown would often have an event to see who could do the most consecutive 360 spins on a skateboard. Variations include one foot spins (on the nose or tail, or grabbing the foot while spinning), two feet spins (on the nose or tail), <b>crossfoot</b> spins, 2-board spins, etc.|$|E

5000|$|A trick {{similar to}} a bicycle wheelie where the rider {{balances}} with the front or back wheels off and without the tail or nose on the ground. Manuals {{can be done with}} both feet, with one foot or on one wheel. In One Foot Manuals the rider places one foot parallel to the board and balances on the nose or tail. A Manual in which both feet are straight on the nose is called a Hang Ten; its tail counterpart is called a Heelie. The rider can also do English Manuals, by keeping the back foot somewhere where the back bolts are and the front foot underneath the nose and hooks the board up until he manuals. The most difficult variation is the Swedish Manual, most likely named after Swedish pro Stefan [...] "Lillis" [...] Akesson. This {{is the same as the}} English Manual, except you place your front foot on the nose pointing forward and use your back toes to hook the board up until you Nose Manual. One of the most difficult manual maneuvers is the Hang Ten Nosemanual, where the skater places both of his feet on the nose of the board and performs a nose manual by balancing on the front two wheels. A <b>crossfoot</b> variation is also possible.|$|E
5000|$|During her {{competitive}} career, Thomson {{was known}} as a particularly strong spinner. [...] Her spins included an unusual back layback, performed on the opposite foot than a normal layback spin. Kay in fact had 3 or 4 unique versions of the layback, performed by no other competitor, and often included each one in her long programs, as well as a unique <b>crossfoot</b> version of the scratch spin. Thomson {{was also one of the}} first female skaters to regularly include the triple Lutz jump in her programs, and the first ever to complete a triple lutz-double toe combination in a short program. [...] Surprisingly despite having a triple lutz, and sometimes a triple flip, she unfortunately was ever unable to master the standard easier triples of the time- triple salchow, triple toe, and triple loop, which most of the leading female contenders at the time had, which held her back on the international stage. With strong choreography and musical interpretation, Kay {{was known as}} a very strong all around skater, and despite failing to reach a world or Olymipc podium is often credited as the one who brought Canadian ladies skating back to prominence after a few years of heavily middling results after the retirements of Karen Magnussen and Lynn Nightingale.|$|E
