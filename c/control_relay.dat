5|$|While {{leading the}} team with 16 goals midway through the 2001–02 season, St. Louis {{suffered}} a broken leg following an awkward check by Josef Melichar of the Pittsburgh Penguins in a late January game. Consequently, he appeared in only 53 of Tampa Bay's 82 games, finishing with 35 points. He had a breakout season in 2002–03, finishing fourth in team scoring with 70 points and tying Vincent Lecavalier for the team lead with 33 goals. He led the team in plus-minus at +10 and appeared in his first NHL All-Star Game. St. Louis won the puck <b>control</b> <b>relay</b> event and {{finished second in the}} fastest skater events of the 2003 All-Star Game's skills competition. He scored his first career hat trick on January 30, 2003, in a game against the Carolina Hurricanes. In the postseason, Tampa Bay won its first playoff series in franchise history when it eliminated the Washington Capitals. Three of St. Louis' seven goals were game-winners, including the overtime goal in the sixth game that won the series. He led {{the team with}} 12 points in 11 playoff games.|$|E
5|$|Following Shooting Accuracy, {{both teams}} {{participated in the}} Skills Challenge Relay. Each team broke into two groups and went {{through a series of}} drills {{designed}} to showcase players' skills. It started with one timers, then proceeded to passing, where a single player had to complete a pass into six small nets. From there it went to the Puck <b>Control</b> <b>Relay,</b> having a participant skate through a series of cones with a puck. Another player then took on the Stick Handling drill, controlling a puck through a series of stationary pucks. The relay ended when a final player completed the Shooting Accuracy, again hitting all four targets. The two groups from Team Lidstrom finished first and third in the competition, gaining their team a total of five points. During the Hardest Shot competition reigning champion Zdeno Chara was defeated in his preliminary round match up by Shea Weber. In the final round, Chara again matched up with Weber. Chara successfully defended his title by defeating Weber with a shot registering 105.9mph. The speed set a new SuperSkills record surpassing his own record and marking the fourth time he has won the event. Despite being down by a large margin prior to the Elimination Shootout, Team Lidstrom still had an opportunity to win the contest. Players continued to shoot provided they scored – scoring one point per goal, until only one player remained. However, the shoot-out was won by Team Staal's Corey Perry as he was the only player to score in all three of his attempts. The full results are listed below.|$|E
25|$|Undrafted out {{of college}} Hunt signed an amateur tryout {{contract}} with the American Hockey League's (AHL) Chicago Wolves. Where his first head coach was Craig MacTavish. He scored his first professional goal on March 29, 2012 in a game versus the Abbotsford Heat in front of 40 friends and family members. The goal tied the game midway through the third period. Chicago eventually won the game in a shootout. He played 14 games for Chicago, registering one goal and five points. He remained with the Wolves for the Calder Cup playoffs playing in 5 games scoring 1 goal and 5 points as the Wolves lost {{in the first round}} to the San Antonio Rampage. In the off-season the Wolves signed Hunt to a standard player contract. In his first full professional season Hunt was named to the 2013 AHL All-Star Game, replacing the injured Brett Sterling as the Wolves representative. At the time of the announcement Hunt was Chicago's leading scorer among defenceman and fourth overall. At the All-Star skills competition he participated in three events; Puck <b>Control</b> <b>Relay,</b> Hardest Shot, and Breakaway Relay. He finished third in the Hardest Shot competition recording a 99.5 miles per hour (mph) shot. In the game Hunt scored a first period goal helping the Western Conference to a 7–6 victory. He finished the season with 4 goals and 33 points as the Wolves missed the playoffs.|$|E

50|$|Another {{latching}} type has a remanent core that {{retains the}} {{contacts in the}} operated position by the remanent magnetism in the core. This type requires a current pulse of opposite polarity to release the contacts. A variation uses a permanent magnet that produces part of the force required to close the contact; the coil supplies sufficient force to move the contact open or closed by aiding or opposing the field of the permanent magnet. A polarity <b>controlled</b> <b>relay</b> needs changeover switches or an H bridge drive circuit to <b>control</b> it. The <b>relay</b> may be less expensive than other types, but this is partly offset by the increased costs in the external circuit.|$|R
50|$|Control relays {{should not}} be {{operated}} above rated temperature because of resulting increased degradation and fatigue. Common practice is to derate 20 degrees Celsius from the maximum rated temperature limit. Relays operating at rated load are affected by their environment. Oil vapor may greatly decrease the contact life, and dust or dirt may cause the contacts to burn {{before the end of}} normal operating life. <b>Control</b> <b>relay</b> life cycle varies from 50,000 to over one million cycles depending on the electrical loads on the contacts, duty cycle, application, {{and the extent to which}} the relay is derated. When a <b>control</b> <b>relay</b> is operating at its derated value, it is controlling a smaller value of current than its maximum make and break ratings. This is often done to extend the operating life of a <b>control</b> <b>relay.</b> The table lists the relay derating factors for typical industrial control applications.|$|E
