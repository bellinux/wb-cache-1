5000|$|Thomas {{spent the}} next several months in and out of confinement, ending in prison in Windsor Castle in April 1643. By August, Thomas was in London {{attempting}} to prevent the seizure of his lands. Parliament had passed sequestration ordinances that allowed them to seize the property and estates of convicted Royalists, and the victims had to pay hefty fines to retrieve their estates. Thomas succeeded in postponing his hearing while he enlisted the help of friends, and eventually gained a recommendation from the Earl of Manchester, a prominent Parliamentarian General. Eventually in August 1644, almost fifteen months since his capture, Thomas' fine was lifted and he was restored to his property. Thomas attempted to remain silent and neutral through the remainder of the conflict, though he remained staunchly loyal to the King, stating in 1648 that a publication had to be by Charles I because [...] "a counterfeit would never have had that power of my passion that this had. I wish forty thousand stout well-armed men had however the same sense of it." [...] Thomas only crops up again twice before he died in 1658. In 1655, he had a spat with one of his tenants, Richard <b>Cosen,</b> a Quaker, when Thomas extorted [...] "a mare and a colt" [...] from <b>Cosen,</b> which exceeded the debt <b>Cosen</b> owed Thomas. Thomas wrote at the time that [...] "mony I can gyt none" [...] as his tenants could not afford to pay their rents, and Thomas could not afford to pay the decimation tax. The decimation tax was reintroduced in 1655 when Parliament renewed efforts to sequester property from Royalists, and Thomas was again a target in Norfolk. Thomas enlisted the help of no one less than the Protector Oliver Cromwell to aid in exempting him from the seizures. Thomas claimed that he had no knowledge of the plot in Lowestoft, had never raised arms against Parliament or the Commonwealth, and that he had been discharged in 1644. Cromwell attempted to intercede, but to no avail. Thomas died two years later in 1658.|$|E

Its inscription [...] "Ann Twice, Her Book" [...] {{would indicate that}} one of the previous owners was Ann Twice, although no information has surfaced on who she was. The first page has two inscriptions on it; the first is [...] "Songs unto the violl and Lute." [...] Beneath that is the note: [...] "my <b>Cosen</b> Twice Leffte this Booke with me when shee went to Broisil which is to be returne to her AGhaine when she Come to Glost." [...] Based on this note, musicologist Ian Spink concluded that Ann Twice lived in Gloucester around 1620 (the date based on John Stafford Smith's attributions). Assuming the songs were copied for her use, Spink surmised that Twice must have been a good singer whose music master (the copyist of the manuscript) was [...] "a man of taste." [...] At some point she traveled to Bristol where she left the manuscript with her cousin, the writer of this inscription (whose name is unknown). The whereabouts of the manuscript are then unknown for nearly two centuries until Smith included selections in his collection Musica Antiqua. In that publication Smith included a note referring to himself as the manuscript's owner. Smith actually marked the manuscript to indicate those songs to be included in Musica Antiqua.|$|E

40|$|Class {{imbalance}} is {{a common}} problem {{in the case of}} real-world object detection and classification tasks. Data of some classes are abundant, making them an overrepresented majority, and data of other classes are scarce, making them an underrepresented minority. This imbalance makes it challenging for a classifier to appropriately learn the discriminating boundaries of the majority and minority classes. In this paper, we propose a cost-sensitive (<b>CoSen)</b> deep neural network, which can automatically learn robust feature representations for both the majority and minority classes. During training, our learning procedure jointly optimizes the class-dependent costs and the neural network parameters. The proposed approach is applicable to both binary and multiclass problems without any modification. Moreover, as opposed to data-level approaches, we do not alter the original data distribution, which results in a lower computational cost during the training process. We report the results of our experiments on six major image classification data sets and show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the baseline algorithms. Comparisons with popular data sampling techniques and <b>CoSen</b> classifiers demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method...|$|E
40|$|In {{wireless}} sensor networks, it is {{an important}} task to periodically collect data from an area of interest for time-sensitive applications. The sensed data must be gathered and transmitted to a base station for further processing to meet the end-user queries. Since the network consists of low-cost nodes with limited battery power, it is a challenging task to design an efficient routing scheme that can minimize delay and offer good performance in energy efficiency, and long network lifetimes. In this paper, we propose a new routing protocol, called Degree-Constrained Minimal Spanning Tree (DCMST), to collect information efficiently. DCMST is efficient in the ways that it ensures maximal utilization of network energy, it makes the lifetime of the network longer, as well as it takes much lower time to complete a round. Simulation results show that DCMST achieves around 20 % better performance than that of <b>COSEN</b> in respect of delay time. It also shows that DCMST can perform better than <b>COSEN</b> in total transmission distance, which implies the less total energy consumption. Therefore, our DCMST scheme gives a good compromise between energy efficiency and latency. 1...|$|E

40|$|Improving the {{efficiency}} of data dissemination algorithms and protocols to mobile sink remains as an interesting research and engineering issue, especial for large-scale wireless sensor network. As the node energy and resources are limited, theses protocols should meet energy-efficiency, low delay and high delivery ratio requirements. Although an energy-efficient dissemination tree (d-tree) can be constructed with sink mobility, the delayed handoff could lead to suboptimal routing trees for {{a substantial amount of}} time as the network grows larger, and also {{the efficiency}} heavily relied on the location of the sink, thus it may offset the load balance resulting from hierarchical tree structure. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient routing protocol MGRP (Multi-tier Grid Routing Protocol) which introduces a special hybrid multi-tier structure for data dissemination. MGRP divides the observation areas into square grids, could be different size. Within each grid, we form an optimized cluster which transmit reliable data to its higher tier cluster head, the uppermost cluster head from neighbor grids further negotiate to construct the data d-tree from which the mobile sink can access and send query. Through intensive simulation in a given mobile sink experiment, MGRP performs better in terms of energy consumption and average delay respectively compared to previous protocols such as TTDD (grid-based), SEAD (tree-based) and <b>COSEN</b> (chain-based), under practical conditions, where sensors may die out, but with initial large size...|$|E
40|$|The {{momentum}} transfer {{intensity of}} flowing liquid with solid walls determines the flow resistance (wall friction), heat tranfer, mass transfer, {{and also the}} likelihood of erosion corrosion initiation on solid surfaces, and is generally characterized in terms of wall shear stresses as an integral parameter. By comparing the order of magnitude of wall shear stresses encoutered in real flow systems (1 to serveral hunderts Pa in extreme cases) with the fracture stress and adhesion forces of corrosion product layers (carbonates, sulfides, oxides) ranging in the Megapascal order it appears that wall shear stresses are orders of magnitudes {{too small to be}} directly responsible for the destruction of protective scales. In this thesis microelectrochemical current noise analysis of near-wall flow dynamics under impinging jet conditions using wavelet transform indicated {{for the first time that}} the maximum interaction energy between near-wall microturbulences and the solid wall can range several orders of magnitude higher than derived from wall shear stress data and is based on the same effects that produce 'freak waves' at the water-air interface. It is long known that the wall shear stress can be considerably reduced by small concentrations of macromolecular compounds and/or substances with potential for supramolecular aggregation (micelle formers). The near-wall freak wave intensity affecting the flow dynamics in the viscous sublayer can be damped significantly by adding surface active compounds at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration. In case of the best additive tested, the maximum transfer Energy can be lowered under the adhesion forces of corrosion product layers. This effect was proofed in corrosion experiment. These findings shed new light on the interactions of flowing fluids with walls and the significant effects supramolecular structures can exert in nanoscale distances from the wall. In order to favour wall interaction effects, exploratory investigations have been performed with microchannels [47] using Si planar technology microelectrode arrays positioned at the bottom of small channels (1000 x 1000 µm, 100 x 1000 µm, 500 x 500 µm) produced in Forturanä glass technology. Surprisingly, compounds active in (electrochemically indicated) near-wall freak wave damping in macro systems appear ineffective in microchannel. While more detailed mechanistic and molecular kinetic evaluation of the data is still needed together with systematic structure-efficiency investigations, the new results outlined above clearly indicate that the <b>cosen</b> methodology (electrochemical quantification of flow intensities with microelectrode arrays in micro-flow channels), the data aquisition rate (200 kHz) and the data evaluation (current noise analysis via wavelet transform with subsequent calculation of near-wall freak wave intensities) represent an efficient approach to study the effect of supramolecular structure in flow fields in nanoscaled distances from the interface...|$|E
