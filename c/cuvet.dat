40|$|Working graphs are {{generally}} nonlinear when the longi-tudinal flameless atomic absorption <b>cuvet</b> is used. Such nonlinear curves {{make it difficult}} to determine the amount of lead in blood by the method of additions, be-cause ofinaccuraciesinextrapolatingthe graph to zero absorbance. This paper describes a method for ob-taining linear graphs by making use of opacity (the re-ciprocal of transmittance, or antilog of the absorbance) instead of absorbance. Because no deuterium arc background corrector is availablefor the Beckman Model 444, background was corrected by reading the opacityata nonabsorbingline, 287. 3 nm, and subtract-ing the opacities. A separate reagent-blank correction for lead must also be made. In flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry, it has been found that in general linear working graphs are ob-tained by plotting absorbance vs. concentration. Deviations from linearity can be ascribed to stray light in the instru-ment (1), hyperfine line structure (2, 3), broad emission lines (as can be produced when the source is operating at high current densities), or resonance line broadening (1). Instrumental faults such as temperature differences in the flame or inhomogeneities of absorbing atoms can also cause nonlinearity of the working graphs (1). If the aspiration ef-ficiency is low and large droplets enter the flame, the size of the particles of solute after solventevaporationwill be pro-portional to the solution concentration, and hence a curved calibration graph may result if the flame temperature is not high enough. Ionization of the analyte can alsobe trouble-some. As a rule, when the flame is used, the method of elec-tronic curve straightening can be applied to get a straight line, but with the <b>cuvet</b> used in the flameless technique this is far less practical. It is therefore necessary to seek some other way of obtaining straight lines...|$|E

The Analyzer occupies only one cubic foot of space. It has a 17. <b>cuVet</b> plastic rotor that rotates through a stationary optical system at speeds up to 5000 rpm. The resulting centrifugal force is utilized to transfer and mix a series of sample(s) and rea-gent(s) into the cuvets. The ensuing reactions are monitored spectrophotometrically, and the data evaluated in real time by an on-line computer. Samples (ito 10 MI) and reagents (70 to 110 MI) are loaded into the rotor either discretely or dynami. cally; various rotor configurations {{can be used to}} do this. Many of the standard clinical analyses, in-cluding most of the NADH-linked enzymatic an-alyses, have been adapted for use with this an-alyzer. Precision obtained ranges from 1 to 4 %. This report considers, specifically, analyses of some serum enzymes.

40|$|A kinetic {{method is}} {{described}} for {{the determination of}} [...] glutamyl transpeptidase activity in serum. Optimal conditions for the reaction were ascertained, normal values in milliunits per milliliter at 25 #{ 176 } established, and {{the reliability of the}} method examined. -Glutamyl-p-nitroanilide in ammediol-HCI buffer at pH 8. 2 is employed as substrate. The method requires only 0. 1 ml. of serum and, using an automatic <b>cuvet</b> positioner and recorder as well as an automatic diluter, more than 60 determinations can be carried out in 1 hr. On the basis {{of a large number of}} determinations, the method was shown to be technically excellent and clinically valuable. A RISE IN SERUM y-GLUTAMYL TRANSPEPTIDASE (7 -GT) ACTIVITY is observed almost exclusively in diseases of tile liver, bile ducts, and pancreas. Extremely high values generally indicate cholestasis without, however, permitting further differentiation. In anicteric patients determination of y-GT activity, particularly as a screening test, has proved to be very valuable (1 - 4). In hepatobiliary diseases the serum activity of alkaline phosphatase, leucine aininopeptidase, and y-GT are equally subject to change, with the last being by far the most sensitive (5 - 8). Glutathione was used originally as substrate for the determination of. y-GT activity (9 - 1. 2). This was later replaced by y-glutamylnaphthylamide (i.) and y-glutamylanilide (14). The aromatic compounds set free during transpeptidation were diazotized and coupled immediately with a chromophore to produce an azo dye. A marked simplification results from using y-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide as substrate. Unlike the cleavage product p-nitroaniline, this substrat...|$|E
40|$|A {{differential}} decomplexation technic for {{the determination}} of serum zinc in fil-trates was studied. It involved the masking of zinc, copper, and iron {{by the addition of}} cyanide to a buffered aliquot of an acid filtrate, followed first by the destruction of the excess cyanide and then the cyanide attached to zinc. The release of ionic zinc allowed reaction with the color reagent to take place. Quantitation with internal blanking was thereby accomplished before interference by other cations became possible. SCHEMES for the analysis of zinc in serum usually employ the extrac-tion of the zinc-dithizone complex (1 - 5). However, no procedure of this type has achieved status as a readily available clinical tool. A monopha sic dithizone system has been proposed, but it requires a special trapezoidal <b>cuvet</b> with a 50 -mm. light path to produce rela-tively insensitive absorbance data (6). Although zincon (2 -carboxy- 2 ’-hydroxy-S’sulfoformazylbenzene) is a sensitive reagent for the de-termination of zinc, it has seen limited application because many other cations also react with this compound. A technic involving dif-ferential (lecomplexation proposed a determination for zinc in water containing zincon-interfering metals (7). It took advantage of this fact: when the cyanide complexes of the trace metals are formed, the cyanide bound to zinc can he preferentially destroyed by chloral hy-drate (8. 6). The demasking technic enables the liberated zinc to form a reproducibly measurable complex with zincon so that subse-quent spectrophotometry under carefully controlled conditions can be achieved before another metal is liberated to interfere with the reac...|$|E
40|$|One hundred blood {{specimens}} {{have been}} analyzed for blood oxygen content simul-taneously by the Van Slyke gasometric technic and gas chromatographic technic. The two;technics agree within ± 0. 83 Vol. %. The gas chromatography instrument must be standardized by comparing its Fe-suIts with another blood oxygen procedure {{such as the}} Van Slyke technic. Suggestions are made {{for the improvement of}} the gas chromatography equipment. D EVELOPMEXTS in diagnostic procedures such as cardiac catheteri-zatioIl have changed the requirements for blood oxygen determina-tion. These procedures sometimes require {{that a large number of}} blood specimens be taken for oxygen determination. Where tile pa-tient is an infant, there is not a large enough circulating blood volume for each of these specimens to be 6 ml., as in replicate determinations by tile classic Van Slyke technic, or even 2 ml., as in most of the spec-trophotometric technics. The instability of blood specimens for oxy-gel! determination, combined iwth the large number of specimens taken in a short time during cardiac catheterization, makes the Van Slyke technic for blood oxygen determination impractical. Several other procedures have been reported. <b>Cuvet</b> oximeters (1), and oxygen tension measurements, either by tile hUI) l) le equilibration method (2) or the oxygen electrode (3), have been tried and each has been rejected for general use because of some major difficulty.

40|$|Photosynthetic and {{respiration}} {{responses were}} measured in situ at different depths and under {{a variety of}} light regime for seagrass Thalassia hemprichii from coastal area of Teluk Kemang, Port Dickson, Malaysia. The photosynthesis and respiration rate was measured from evolution of oxygen from the seagrass enclosed in glass <b>cuvet.</b> The photosynthetic rate at 0. 5 m was higher (0. 429 � 0. 086 mg O 2 /hr/g fr wt.) than at 2. 0 m depth (0. 289 � 0. 034 mg O 2 /hr/g fr wt.). Respiration rate was not significantly different at two depths. In laboratory study, the light saturation of T. hemprichii was reached at 400 - 800 �mol/m 2 /sec, whereas, the compensation point was around 20 �mol/m 2 /s. The photosynthesis was relatively constant at light intensity up to 1600 �mol/m 2 /s. Comparing these results to in situ light measurement from the seagrass bed (1095. 430 � 5. 803 �mol/m 2 /s at surface water and 115. 00 � 1. 512 �mol/m 2 /s. at 2. 0 m depth), this species depth distribution should not be light limited to a depth of about 2. 0 m i. e. T. hemprichii could penetrate a depth of more than 2. 0 m in this study area. However, the present field observation indicated that this species could only be found at intertidal area (1. 5 - 2. 0 m High Water Level) and assumed that other environmental factors i. e. current movement, water visibility and sediment status may affects the depth distribution of this seagrass in this costal water...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{transition}} of the dielectric properties of cells as a marker of their permeabilization. A demonstration of the transition between positive and negative DiElectroPhoresis (DEP) {{as a reaction to}} electroporation pulses is achieved in a microfluidic device. Electropermeabilization of cell membrane is broadly used in cell biology for electrotransfert of genes and other molecules in vitro and in vivo [1] or for electrofusion [2]. The success rate of this technique is nevertheless highly variable, {{depending on the type of}} cells, its status in the cell cycle and on the method used. In the case of the use of conventional electroporation <b>cuvet,</b> the electroporation rate remains unsatisfying (if we apply an electric field for which 90 % of the cells survive, the efficiency remains below 20 % [3]). Several attempts to propose biochips dedicated to the electroporation have been proposed to address this issue [4]. The advantages of using a dedicated microfluidic device are i) the capability to control precisely the electrical field at the scale of the single cell [4] ii) the possibility to parrallelize ([5], [6]) or serialize [7] the single cell electroporation function in order to achieve the high number of cells with a good ratio of permeabilization. We present in this paper a novel method, implemented on a microfluidic device, that permits to control automatically and independently the level of electropermeabilization of cells. The cells are disposed in successive traps, using DEP force. Once the membrane permeabilization occurs, the dielectrical properties of cells change. I...|$|E
40|$|A simple technic {{to adapt}} the {{advantages}} of continuous flow analysis to the kinetic assay of multiple enzyme samples is described. It will permit adequate standardization by primary or secondary standards run through the entire analysis of those procedures that do not exhibit spontaneous changes in light absorption or fluorescence with time. The adaptation of the Kind-King method for alkaline phosphatase (1) to this technic is given to demonstrate the superiority of such a system over single-point enzyme assays. THE ASSAY of enzymatic activity by a sin. qie determination of a prod-uct formed or substrate consumed at a fixed time after mixing the sub-strate and sample is inherently poor methodology. The application of such methodology to continuous flow analysis, when the flow is main-tained by the squeezing action of rollers on flexible tubing, vaniegates the single fixed time and makes standardization a problem. The increasing use of commercially available enzyme preparations (which are not standards in the chemical sense, regardless of the desig-nations applied {{to them by the}} manufacturers) as the only solution to this standardization problem commits an even more serious breach of chemically acceptable methodology. The use of the AutoAnalyzer to study the kinetics of enzyme-substrate complexes and the effects of such parameters as pH and substrate concentration has already been described (2 - 4). We have developed a simple means of utilizing the advantages of continuous flow analysis for measuring by reaction rates the enzymatic activity of a series of samples. We were particularly concerned with those reactions that cannot be incubated in a <b>cuvet</b> and followed spectro-photometrically or fluorometnically. Our primary goal, however, was to achieve a system that could be adequately standardized. To illustrate tile simplicity of this system we present as an exampl...|$|E
40|$|The Potentiophotometer {{is a new}} {{instrument}} for measuring the absorption characteristics of solutions. A brief de-scription of its construction and theory of operation is presented, with illustrations of its use in the colorimetric quantitative analysis for inorganic phosphorus and total protein in serum. The potentiophotometric results correlate well (r = 0. 97 to 0. 98) with measurements made of the same solutions with either of two conventional spectro-photometers, the Gilford 300 N and the Coleman Jr. II. Additional Keyphrases: inorganic phosphorus and total protein measurements. absorptiometry The Potentiophotometer is a simple instrument, consisting of focused light source, <b>cuvet</b> holder, photo-voltaic cell, constant power source, two potentiometers, and a metering device. The photovoltaic cell and con-stant power source are arranged in series opposition (i. e., with like pole to like pole) so that {{the output of the}} photovoltaic cell is subtracted from the output of the constant power source. The two potentiometers (voltage dividers) appropriately expand the output of the dif-ference between the constant power source and the photovoltaic cell. Because the photovoltaic cell output varies logarithmically and inversely with the concen-tration of the substance being measured, and the power source output is constant, the operation may be ex-pressed as K- log T, where K is a constant and T is transmittance. This constitutes the electrical analog solution to Beer’s law, C 2 - log %T, where C is the concentration of the substance being measured. The potentiometers, when appropriately set, multiply the Beer’s law equation so that it is properly proportioned and C = k(2 - log %T), where the values of k and 2 are determined by the potentiometer settings. The Poten-tiophotometer in the present paper is modified from one previously described (1). 1 Detailed explanation of th...|$|E
