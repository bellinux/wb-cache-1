40|$|In Assemble-To-Order (ATO) systems, {{situations}} {{may arise}} in which customer demand must be backlogged {{due to a}} shortage of some components, leaving available stock of other components unused. Such unused component stock is called remnant stock. Remnant stock {{is a consequence of}} both component ordering decisions and decisions regarding allocation of components to end-product demand. In this article, we examine periodic-review ATO systems under linear holding and backlogging costs with a <b>component</b> <b>installation</b> stock policy and a First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) allocation policy. We show that the FCFS allocation policy decouples the problem of optimal component allocation over time into deterministic period-by-period optimal component allocation problems. We denote the optimal allocation of components to end-product demand as multimatching. We solve the multi-matching problem by an iterative algorithm. In addition, an approximation scheme for the joint replenishment and allocation optimization problem with both upper and lower bounds is proposed. Numerical experiments for base-stock component replenishment policies show that under optimal base-stock policies and optimal allocation, remnant stock holding costs must be taken into account. Finally, joint optimization incorporating optimal FCFS component allocation is valuable because it provides a benchmark against which heuristic methods can be compared...|$|E

The 5 kW-capacity fuel cells operate on reformed natural gas. These systems operate at preset levels providing power to the residence and to the utility grid. During grid outages, the residential power source is disconnected from the grid and the fuel cell system operates in standby mode to provide power to critical loads in the residence.

The Fast Scattering Code (FSC) was used to simulate the insertion losses resulting from the interaction of incident sound generated by flow over the cylinders with the QFF apparatus. Two sources of sound were used to model the flow generated noise: 1) a line of point dipoles placed at the axis of the rear cylinder, and 2) CFD/CAA generated unsteady pressures on the cylinder surfaces in free flow. As observed at the microphone locations used in the test, {{the effects of the}} QFF components on the acoustic field were small, being on the order of 2 dB for all frequencies considered, when the dipole line source was employed. Installation effects were higher when the time dependent surface pressures were used as noise generators, being approximately 6 to 9 dB for the primary shedding frequency and 3 to 5 dB for the second harmonic. This difference is most likely due to the absence of near field flow non-uniformities in the FSC calculations. Inclusion of these effects through the use of penetrable data surfaces located in the linear flow region should yield better estimates of the incident sound field.

40|$|Crusade' was a solo {{multimedia}} exhibition, {{which emerged}} from a process of site-specific research {{into the history of}} the city of St Louis. In response to a paper delivered to the conference ‘Shades of Black' at Duke University in 2001, Piper was approached by Shannon Fitzgerald, Chief Curator at the Contemporary Art Museum, St Louis, to develop a project. Piper subsequently engaged in a series of research visits to St Louis. Exploring local archive material in the light of postcolonial theory and the semiology of local public monumental sculpture, Piper began to examine a set of conceptual relationships linking the founding of St Louis (1763), its position {{in the wake of the}} Louisiana Purchase (1803), and its site as a key location in the growing conflict between North and South in the Dred Scott case (1857). Using these historical strands, Piper proposed a reading of St Louis as a site of symbolic tensions between the ‘known' and the ‘other'. These themes were integrated into a series of multi-channel animated video collages presented across high-definition plasma screens. Specific technical research was conducted in collaboration with local specialists around the streaming of high-definition video within a gallery setting. ‘Chilly Water', a <b>component</b> <b>installation</b> of the exhibition, evoked the memory of Dred Scott (1799 - 1858) through the exploration of narratives of slave escape.

The maximum bunch intensity is 2. 9 X 10 lo electrons/pulse. A peak particle energy of 53 GeV has been reached. Operation at 47 GeV is now routine. The energy and energy spectrum of the electron beam can be rapidly measured nondestructively at high energy. These signals {{will be used in}} a fast feedback system nearing comple-‘tion.

Slow feedback of the injection position and angle into the linac and injection into the north Arc are operationalP Longitudinal and transverse wakefields have been measured and appear to be near expectations. Transverse position measurements {{at the end of the}} linac show a 120 Mm horizontal and a 30 pm vertical (rms) jitter from pulse to pulse. The spot shape, including the transverse tails, also shows some jitter. The transverse position and shape fluctuations have several sources involving launch instabilities, chromatic effects, RF deflections and lattice mismatches. Continued improvements are expected.

40|$|A {{smart factory}} {{is defined as}} a factory, which is {{composed}} of automated energy consumer machines and facilities that are integrated with IT technologies. Factories are considered as one of the highest energy consumers in 21 st century. Increasing energy prices due to the limited nature of fossil energy sources and environmental legislation stresses on the importance of energy efficiency performance of smart factories. Many Manufacturers by taking the advantage of energy management systems are trying to improve energy efficiency of the factories. There are many factories which are applying different tools aiming to compute energy efficiency Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). In order to have an energy efficient factory and subsequently stronger energy management, these KPIs are needed to be usable, operational and easily accessible by the factory’s experts. Data relevant to the Energy efficiency KPIs are usually stored in Relational Databases (RDB). RDBs are working under Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). However, RDBMS has a rigid data structure and basically are built biased to serve the implementations and <b>component</b> <b>installation</b> strategies of the manufacturing process. Therefore, RDBs cannot meet the requirements to have a conceptual data model. Use of a proper ontology as a semantic model of the manufacturing domain, on top of RDBs seems to be a promising solution to overcome this problem. Ontologies are considered as a reliable tool for providing a shared conceptualization of the domain of interest. This facilitates the cross-domain access of KPIs in the factory. Retrieving data from RDBs through on ontology model is called Ontology-Based Data Access (OBDA). OBDA is based on correspondences between the relational database and ontology model. 	This research work results in development of OBDA application for energy efficiency KPIs. The designed OBDA for KPIs is applicable within a service-oriented manufacturing enterprise.

Developed high through-hole installation technology {{of electronic}} components {{on the main}} board provides significant reducing of the strain transmitted to electronic components in comparison with standard low through-hole and surface-mount installation. The strain in integrated circuits mounted on the main board depends on rigidity and design of their pins. The offered soft installation technology 3 - 4 times reduces strain {{in comparison with the}} solid installation. Hollow electronic modules are more sensitive to main board deformation than the encapsulated ones. The strain in electronic modules changes depending on duration of the main board deformation they are installed on. The deformation produced by the main board onto contact pads (assumed to be weak links of the whole structure) in electronic modules is found to be dependent on connecting leads or pins, and decreasing their rigidity or applying compensators can significantly reduce the influence of the main board onto the electronic components. The measured strain in case of soft installation technology is 3 - 4 times lower than the strain in solid installation. The developed method for acceptable limit specification of PCB warpage is applicable for any design of electronic modules and any installation technology. For the more detailed research of the strain in electronic components, which are relatively small objects, the further research will be aimed at application acoustic emission method in order to develop methods for strength diagnostics and predicting possible breakages at the stage long before a fatal destruction in electronic packages.
