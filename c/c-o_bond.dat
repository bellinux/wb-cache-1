30|$|It {{should be}} noted that during the thermal {{annealing}} up to 180  °C transformation of carbonyl carbon bonds (C=O, 287.6  eV) into <b>C–O</b> <b>bonds</b> (286.7  eV) takes place while a concentration of the carboxylate carbon (O–C=O, 289.0  eV) remains almost constant (see Fig.  3 f).

Further increase of annealing temperature results in increase of the non-oxygenated carbon concentration which at annealing temperature of 250  °C reaches 76 % from total carbon concentration (C/O[*]=[*] 3.26) in the reduced GO.
