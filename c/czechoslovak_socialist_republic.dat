In the aftermath of the invasion the Brezhnev Doctrine was introduced; it stated that the Soviet Union had the right to intervene in any socialist country on the road to communism which was deviating from the communist norm of development. The doctrine was condemned by Romania, Albania and Yugoslavia. As a result, the worldwide communist movement became poly-centric, meaning that the Soviet Union lost its role as 'leader' of the world communist movement. In the aftermath of the invasion, Brezhnev reiterated this doctrine in a speech at the Fifth Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party (PUWP) on 13 November 1968: ...|$|E

The thesis is composed of five chapters. The first chapter deals with definition issue of vague legal term of "pornography" and other related terms ("child pornography", "hardcore pornography"). Furthermore, it briefly describes attitudes to the term of pornography in the legal systems of Slovakia and the United States of America and examines the issue of so called virtual pornography. The second chapter {{provides an overview of}} the related most important international instruments such as anti-pornography treaties concluded in the early 20 th century as well as modern United Nations and Council of Europe treaties and European Union legal documents aiming at combat sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. The third chapter outlines historical development of the Czechoslovak and Czech criminal regulation of pornography in the former Austro-Hungarian criminal codes, recodification draft bills from the era of the First <b>Czechoslovak</b> <b>Republic,</b> <b>socialist</b> criminal codes of 1950 and 1961 and later [...] ...|$|R
