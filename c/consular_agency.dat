25|$|To manage U.S. {{maritime}} {{interests in}} South India, Joy appointed American merchant William Abbott {{as the first}} American consular agent of the Madras Presidency on 24 November 1794, who served {{for more than a}} decade. The Indo-American trade experienced a hiatus for several decades that followed, and, when it revived, a separate U.S. <b>consular</b> <b>agency</b> was established in Madras on 24 May 1867 with Joseph L. Thompson, of Massachusetts, serving as the consular agent to Madras. He served till October 1872. The consular agents in Madras were expected to report directly to the State Department of the U.S. government. The post continued as a <b>consular</b> <b>agency</b> under the Consulate General at Calcutta until 1908. The main role of the consular agents during those times was to promote trade and business interests of the United States, and most consular agents between 1867 until 1908 were selected from the ranks of expatriate businessmen.|$|E

This changed the prevailing trend, and in June 1908, the post of <b>consular</b> <b>agency</b> was raised {{to the rank of}} a consulate. In December 1908, with the recommendation by the U.S. Department of State, Nathaniel B. Stewart was appointed as the first representative of the American government with the title of Consul in Madras, who served the next two years. An office was established with the official status as a consulate {{on the third floor of}} a building owned by Parrys & Co., located on No. 1 China Bazaar Road, now known as Netaji Subash Chandra Bose Road, at Parry's Corner. Later, the office moved to a building between Rajaji Salai and Moore Street.

60|$|A recent {{telegram}} from Sir Samuel Baker {{assures us}} that a great step {{has been made in}} the way of checking the tide of slavery in the third--the Egyptian--channel, and Sir Bartle Frere bears testimony to the desire of the Khedive that slavery should be put down in his dominions. For this we have reason to be thankful; and the appearance of affairs in that quarter is hopeful, but our hope is mingled with anxiety, because mankind is terribly prone to go to sleep on hopeful appearances. Our nature is such, that our only chance of success lies, under God, in resolving ceaselessly to energise until our ends be accomplished. We must see to it that the Khedive of Egypt acts in accordance with his professions, and for this end efficient <b>consular</b> <b>agency</b> is as needful in the north-east as in the south-east.|$|E

60|$|In brief, {{the great}} points {{on which we}} ought as a nation, to insist, are the {{immediate}} abolition of the slave-trade in Portuguese dependencies; the scrupulous fulfilment of treaty obligations by the Sultans of Zanzibar and Muscat, the Shah of Persia, and the Khedive of Egypt; the establishment by our Government of efficient <b>consular</b> <b>agencies</b> where such are required; the acquisition of territory on the mainland for the purposes already mentioned, and the united action of all Christians in our land to raise funds and send men to preach the Gospel to the negro.

50|$|Some {{countries}} have made reservations to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, {{but they are}} minor. A number of countries limit the diplomatic immunity of persons who are citizens of the receiving country. As nations keep faith to their treaties with differing zeal, other rules may also apply, though in most cases this summary is a reasonably accurate approximation. The Convention does not cover the personnel of international organizations, whose privileges are decided upon on a case-by-case basis, usually in the treaties founding such organizations. The United Nations system (including its agencies, which comprise the most recognizable international bodies such as the World Bank and many others) has a relatively standardized form of limited immunities for staff traveling on U.N. laissez-passer; diplomatic immunity is often granted to the highest-ranking officials of these <b>agencies.</b> <b>Consular</b> officials (that do not have concurrent diplomatic accreditation) formally have a more limited form of immunity, generally limited to their official duties. Diplomatic technical and administrative staff also have more limited immunity under the Vienna Convention; for this reason, some countries may accredit a member of technical or administrative staff as an attaché.|$|R
