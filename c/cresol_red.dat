The proposed gas-permeation system consists of a newly designed gas-permeation unit, a sample injection valve, a reaction coil and two six-way rotary valves in a constant-temperature oven. The gas- permeation unit was assembled using an inner micro porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane tubing and an outer glass tube, which could be easily connected with one another using connectors with ferrules and o-rings. A sample solution was injected into a carrier containing 0. 02 M sodium hydroxide, in which ammonium ion was converted to gaseous ammonia. The gaseous ammonia generated in the carrier passed through the micro porous PTFE membrane, was absorbed in a reagent solution and changed the pH of the reagent solution, which resulted in a color change to <b>cresol</b> <b>red.</b> The absorbance change of <b>cresol</b> <b>red</b> at 550 nm was measured using a visible detector with a flow cell (8 μl, 10 mm path). After the measurement, two six-way rotary valves were switched over from the flowing state to the drain state of the gas-permeation unit, and the residual solutions in the gas-permeation unit were removed and the PTFE membrane tubing was dried. By keeping the temperature of the oven at 40 ℃, the sensitivity and the reproducibility for the determination of ammonium ion was improved. Furthermore, the efficiency of gas permeation through the inner tubing could be kept high and constant for a long period without any procedure for reactivating the porous PTFE membrane tubing. Calibration graphs for ammonium ion were liner over ranges of 0 to 10 ppm and 0 to 1. 0 ppm of N-NH(4) (+), and the sampling rate was 30 samples per hour. The detection limit for N-NH(4) (+) was about 0. 01 ppm when the effective length of the membrane tubing was 5 cm. By using the proposed FIA system, ammonium ion in river-water samples was determined. The analytical results obtained by the proposed method showed a good correlation with those obtained using the indophenol derivatization/FIA method. The relative standard deviations of ten injections were 0. 51 % and 0. 83 % with concentrations of 2. 73 ppm and 4. 11 ppm, respectively. The recoveries of ammonium ion were found to be 97 ～ 98 %. ガス透過分離におけるガス透過の長期間の安定性と高効率化,更にガス透過効率の長期間の再現性を向上させた,新しいオンラインガス透過システムを構築した. このシステムでは新しく設計・製作したガス透過ユニットを組み込み,ユニット中を溶液が下方から上方に流れるようにし,気泡の発生を防ぐ工夫がほどこされ,更に測定後にガス透過ユニット内に滞留する溶液を排除するために 2 個の六方切り替えバルブを内蔵させている. ガスの安定的透過のために温度制御できる小型恒温槽を装着した. この装置中にガス透過ユニット,アンモニウムイオン定量用の反応コイルなどを組み入れ,精密測定の向上を目指した. ガス透過ユニットは,多孔質ポリテトラフルオロエチレン(PTFE) チューブとガラス管からなり,接続には樹脂製フェラル及びO-リングを用い,組み立てを容易にし,デッドボリュームも小さくした. ガス透過ユニット,反応コイル及び試料注入器などを恒温槽の中で一定温度に保つことにより,安定した再現性の良い測定が可能となった. ガス透過ユニット内に滞留する溶液を簡単かつ迅速に強制排除する機能も備えており,測定後はガス透過ユニット中の溶液を除いておくことにより,多孔質チューブの透過性能が長期間維持され,再活性化の操作をすることなく,高いガス透過効率を維持することができた. 本システムを用いると,検量線は 0 ～ 10, 0 ～ 1. 0 ppmの範囲で良好な直線性を示し, 1 時間当たり 30 試料の分析が可能となった. 実際に,河川水中のアンモニウムイオンの定量を行ったところ,インドフェノール誘導体/FIA/吸光光度法による定量値と良く一致し,試料に対する相対標準偏差は 0. 51, 0. 83 %で,回収率は 97 ～ 98 %と良好であった...|$|E
40|$|The redox {{reaction}} between 4 -chlorophenol (4 -CP) and chromate (Cr(VI)) (i. e., the simultaneous oxidation of 4 -CP by Cr(VI) and reduction of Cr(VI) by 4 -CP) in ice (i. e., at &# 8722; 20  °C) was {{compared with the}} corresponding reaction in water (i. e., at 25  °C). The redox conversion of 4 -CP/Cr(VI), which was negligible in water, was significantly accelerated in ice. This accelerated redox conversion of 4 -CP/Cr(VI) in ice is ascribed to the freeze concentration effect occurring during freezing, which excludes solutes (i. e., 4 -CP and Cr(VI)) and protons from the ice crystals and subsequently concentrates them in the liquid brine. The concentrations of Cr(VI) and protons in the liquid brine were confirmed by measuring the optical image and the UV&# 8211;vis absorption spectra of <b>cresol</b> <b>red</b> (CR) as a pH indicator of frozen solution. The redox conversion of 4 -CP/Cr(VI) was observed in water when the concentrations of 4 -CP/protons or Cr(VI) /protons increased by 100 / 1000 -fold. These results corroborate the freeze concentration effect {{as the reason for}} the accelerated redox conversion of 4 -CP/Cr(VI) in ice. The redox conversion of various phenolic pollutants/Cr(VI) and 4 -CP/Cr(VI) in real wastewater was successfully achieved in ice, which verifies the environmental relevance and importance of freezing-accelerated redox conversion of phenolic pollutants/Cr(VI) in cold regions. ope...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{kinetics}} of flash-induced proton uptake at the reducing site of Photosystem II with <b>Cresol</b> <b>red</b> as indicator for pH transients in the suspending medium. The {{rise of the}} alkalization which was observed when Photosystem II was hidden in the stacked regions of the thylakoid membranes was much slower (100 ms) than {{the reduction of the}} bound quinones (less than 1 ms). We asked for the delay mechanism. We found that the rise of the alkalization became biphasic if thylakoids were unstacked. This was reversed upon restacking: The portion of the fast phase (half-rise time, 2. 7 ms) increased, if the concentration of Mg high 2 plus was lowered. After EDTA-treatment we observed solely fast proton uptake. Experiments with dark-adapted chloroplasts showed that the biphasicity was not attributable to the alternating transitions of the bound quinone acceptors through the semiquinone and the hydroquinone stages. The dependence of fast proton uptake on the degree of membrane stacking was o n line with our previous proposal (Hong and Junge (1983) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 722, 197 - 205) that the propagation of a pH pulse in the narrow gaps between stacked membranes was slowed down by multiple reactions of protons with fixed buffering groups. This concept was corroborated by a theory which was given in the subsequent article...|$|E
40|$|This work {{provides}} improved {{procedures for}} spectrophotometric carbon system measurements. Indicator dyes used for routine spectrophotometric pH measurements in seawater suffer from impurity issues, which introduce vendor-specific systematic errors in pH determinations. The magnitude of these errors for several vendors was investigated for meta Cresol Purple (mCP) and <b>Cresol</b> <b>Red</b> (CR). Flash chromatography procedures {{were developed to}} obtain purified mCP and CR on a bulk scale in order to supply the oceanographic research community with the indicators. Easy access to the purified indicators ensures global intercomparability of spectrophotometric pH determinations. Internal consistency of marine inorganic carbon system measurements was studied using datasets obtained on two large coastal ocean acidification research cruises. In both cases, purified mCP was used to obtain the pH measurements, thereby improving accuracy relative to previous studies in which measurements were obtained with unrefined mCP. Based on this internal consistency study, recommendations are made for selecting the parameter pairs used for saturation state calculations. Direct spectrophotometric methods for measuring carbonate ion concentrations in seawater were improved by (a) using a higher concentration of lead as the carbonate indicator and (b) altering the carbonate computational algorithm based on high quality field data. Measurements of DIC and pH (using purified mCP) were used to calculate carbonate ion concentrations for comparison with spectrophotometrically measured carbonate ion concentrations (i. e., via spectrophotometric measurements of Pb(II) spectra in the ultraviolet). Minor changes in the computational algorithm substantially improved agreement between measured and calculated carbonate ion concentrations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a novel gallium nitride/poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) -co-polypyrrole (GaN/PEDOT–PPY) {{nanocomposite}} is reported. GaN nanoparticles were synthesized {{by using}} super critical ammonia method. GaN/PEDOT–PPY nanocomposite has been synthesized by chemical oxidative polymerization method. UV–Visible spectroscopy, shows the π–π∗ interactions have enabled the delocalization of electrons throughout the polymer network {{and led to}} the high performance of the prepared nanocomposite. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, gives information about the functional groups. X-ray diffraction (XRD), shows XRD pattern of GaN, which exhibits hexagonal phase with reflections of 100, 002, 101, 102, 110, 103, 112 and the corresponding peaks were observed at 2 θ= 32. 49, 34. 62, 36. 82, 48. 15, 57. 69, 19 respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) expose that there is an interaction between GaN and PEDOT–PPY. The morphological studies confirmed the formation of PEDOT–PPY nanospike on the surface of GaN nanoparticles. The synthesized composite was used as an electrochemical catalyst for the oxidation of an antihelminthic drug mebendazole, examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The GaN/PEDOT–PPY modified GCE (GaN/PEDOT–PPY/GCE) showed electrocatalytic oxidation of mebendazole in the linear range 0. 33 – 5. 63 μM with the limit of detection (LOD) 2. 44 × 10 − 6 M. Photocatalytic degradation of <b>cresol</b> <b>red</b> (CR) was studied using GaN/PEDOT–PPY. We have utilized the prepared GaN/PEDOT–PPY nanocomposite for two different applications and found its prominent function. Such eminent performances of the prepared novel nanocomposite can open up new opportunities for developing many technological applications...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of the {{investigation}} of various halophilic bacteria it became of interest to determine the magnitude of the sodium chloride error in the colorimetric estimation of pH. Various investigators (Clark, 1925) have estimated salt errors at low concentrations (1 M or less) while both Wells (1920) and Ramage and Miller (1925) have studied the salt errors of <b>cresol</b> <b>red</b> over fairly wide ranges of salt concentration. The object of this work was to ascertain the errors in measuring colorimetrically the pH of solutions 1, 2 and 3 M with respect to sodium chloride using the sulfon phthalein series of indicators. The general procedure consisted in buffering the salt solutions, adding indicator and adjusting to the same color as that given by an identical buffer containing no salt. The pH of each solu-tion was then measured electrometrically and {{the difference between the two}} readings taken as the salt error. The standard buffer solutions proposed by Clark and Lubs (Clark, 1925) were prepared in M/ 5 concentration from specially purified materials and preserved in glass stoppered Pyrex glass containers. The sodium hydroxide solution was prepared car-bonate free from sodium amalgam and preserved in an appro-priate manner. The buffer solutions were made up to the recommended M/ 20 concentration immediately before use. The following is given as an example of the method finally adopted. First the standard buffer solution was made up to a suitable pH, a 10 cc. portion measured into a comparator tube and indicator added. An identical buffer solution 1, 2 or 3...|$|E
