For this reason, {{it is important}} to reduce its consumption without negatively affecting the quality of final products. By means of experimental investigations (thermo-couples measurements and infrared camera analyses) coupled to a simplified thermal numerical model, it has been possible to study the complete thermal evolution of low <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> <b>ingots</b> of various diameters during the heating stage carried out in methane ovens. By evaluating of both experimental and numerical results, the heating cycle has been optimized. Three main aspects were taken into account: the final quality of forgings, energy and heating time reduction. The potential for significant savings in terms of energy and cycle time have been finally evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} {{influence of}} degree processing for {{parameters of the}} structure and properties of products after hot rolling of continuous ingots made of low <b>carbon</b> <b>steels.</b> Design/methodology/approach: <b>Ingots</b> with cross sections of 105 x 105 mm and 135 x 135 mm were rolled to wire rod and bars respectively, with applying the degree of processing λ = 6. 5 - 115 and λ= 3 - 14. Tests of the microstructure parameters and their distributions were carried out on a SEM HITACHI S- 4200, using the Met-Ilo computer application. Findings: Parameters of the structure and properties of steel after hot rolling of a continuous ingot made of low-carbon steel and after air-cooling, significantly depend {{on the degree of}} processing. After the hot rolling process of the continuous <b>ingots</b> of <b>steel</b> of S 355 J 2 grade within the range of the degree of processing λ = 2. 97 - 14. 15, a structure of ferritic-pearlitic steel with heterogeneous distribution on the cross-section was revealed. Practical implications: A good quality of products after hot rolling is obtain for minimal degree of processing, which will ensure obtaining an advantageous structure and properties. Originality/value: The finding of the quantitative relations between the degree of processing, the structure and properties allows for predicting the minimal value of the degree of processing, which should guarantee obtaining the required structural features and consequently, product’s functional properties...|$|R

Segregation of elements was determined based on the quantitative analysis of results performed by using spark spectrometry pursuant to PN-H- 04045. Changes in concentrations of elements were analysed along the line, which join the opposite sides of the sample in their half length and pass through the geometric centre of the square cross-section. In the further course of the research study, there was also determined the segregation along perpendicular line up to the surface connecting the core of the cross-section with lateral plane.

Heat transfer in the mold and insulation materials, as well as the formation of a shrinkage cavity at the top, is taken into account.

The predicted variation of the macrosegregation of carbon and sulfur along the vertical centerline is compared with measurements from an industrial <b>steel</b> <b>ingot</b> that was sectioned and analyzed.
