5|$|During December 1914, O'Leary saw heavy {{fighting}} with the Irish Guards and was Mentioned in Despatches and subsequently promoted to Lance Corporal on 5 January 1915. Three weeks later, on 30 January, the Irish Guards were ordered to prepare for an attack on German positions near Cuinchy on the La Bassée Canal, {{a response to a}} successful German operation in the area five days before. The Germans attacked first however, and on the morning of 1 February seized a stretch of <b>canal</b> <b>embankment</b> on the western end of the 2nd Brigade line from a company of Coldstream Guards. This section, known as the Hollow, was tactically important as it defended a culvert that passed underneath a railway embankment. 4 Company of Irish Guards, originally in reserve, were tasked with joining the Coldstream Guards in retaking the position at 04:00, but the attack was met with heavy machine gun fire and most of the assault party, including all of the Irish Guards officers, were killed or wounded.|$|E

25|$|In 1848, the {{carriage}} of goods earned the company £9,049. The railway company began operating as a carrier soon afterwards, on a fairly small scale, and this continued until 1894, by which time most of the trade was in cotton. Trade in the return direction dwindled, {{to the point where the}} operation was uneconomic, and ceased. In 1905, boats using the canal carried coal, raw cotton, grain, which was supplied to textile and flour mills, and stone, but by this time traffic volumes were small. On 29 February 1912, the canal burst its banks at Kerridge, flooding several nearby streets. The cause was the failure of a culvert that carried Tinkers Brook under the <b>canal</b> <b>embankment,</b> at about 1:00 am. By the time the bridges could be stopped with stop planks, most of the upper pound above Bosley locks had drained away. It took three weeks to repair the breach, and around 100 men were employed to fill the gap with 160 boat loads of clay puddle and other materials.|$|E

50|$|In 1848 {{the stream}} Shaker Run forever damaged the canal. Shaker Run, in western Turtlecreek Township, drained the large swamp on the Shaker {{settlement}} at Union Village. The stream frequently jumped its banks and flooded the canal, depositing sediment that required constant dredging and repairs. Finally, Shaker Run {{broke through the}} <b>canal's</b> <b>embankment.</b>|$|R
5000|$|During {{excavations}} a {{drainage culvert}} was discovered about [...] west of Terminus bridge. [...] Work resumed in September and November 2014 to batter and reshape the <b>canal</b> <b>embankments.</b> Excess topsoil was removed and the towpath reinstated on the stretch {{to the east}} from Terminus bridge for about [...] On the same stretch a retaining wall was discovered in the south embankment continuing for about , possibly built as a repair to a weak section of canal banking. Vertical infills of white clay have been used along this wall.|$|R
500|$|The Severn Railway Bridge {{was built}} by the Severn Bridge Railway Company to {{transport}} coal from the Forest of Dean on the Severn and Wye Railway. At {{the time it was}} expected that the amount of coal freighted would increase year by year and the existence of a bridge would remove the necessity for the coal to be shipped via Gloucester. Work began in 1875 and was completed in 1879; the wrought iron bridge, which was [...] long and [...] above high water, had twenty-two spans and had stone abutments made from local limestone. The first span across the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, which ran parallel to the Severn at this point, operated as a swing bridge. The twenty-one fixed spans, in order of erection from the south-east (Sharpness) side, consisted of 13 of length , 5 of length , 2 of length , and a single span of length [...] The bridge incorporated 6,800 tons of iron. It was approached from the south-east by a two-arch masonry viaduct on the <b>canal</b> <b>embankment</b> leading to the swing-bridge, and on the north-west by a 12-arch viaduct about [...] high.|$|E
60|$|Still the Marsh {{remained}} {{remote and}} original, on the old, quiet {{side of the}} <b>canal</b> <b>embankment,</b> in the sunny valley where slow water wound along in company of stiff alders, and the road went under ash-trees past the Brangwens' garden gate.|$|E
60|$|At {{the back}} a {{confusion}} of sheds spread into the home-close {{from out of}} two or three indistinct yards. The duck-pond lay beyond the furthest wall, littering its white feathers on the padded earthen banks, blowing its stray soiled feathers into the grass and the gorse bushes below the <b>canal</b> <b>embankment,</b> which rose like a high rampart near at hand, so that occasionally a man's figure passed in silhouette, or a man and a towing horse traversed the sky.|$|E
50|$|Another lock, which survived until today, was set {{west of the}} sluice and it was {{put into}} service in 1915. It {{was part of a}} new section Bydgoszcz Canal, fitted to 400-ton barges standards, along with two newly built large locks, in Okole and Czyżkówko. The same year, the old {{trapezoidal}} lock was filled and its stone revetment is still visible today at Marcinkowski Street. In 2014, to celebrate the 240th anniversary of the Bydgoszcz <b>Canal,</b> <b>embankments</b> and walls of the old lock chamber have been unveiled and exposed in an educational and historical purposes, {{as a part of the}} revitalisation project of Brda river.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge was}} built in 1896 {{in the place of}} a boat ferry as a single span wooden bridge which {{connected}} Big and Little Italian streets. The engineer L.N. Kolpitsin was author of the project. The novelty at the time was use of xilolit plates as a paving material. In 1902 the bridge was rebuilt for the first time, and around 1911-1912 it was rebuilt again.After quarter of century, in 1937 the bridge went through the capital reconstruction, in order to fit two termal pipes into it. In 1955 during the renovation of Griboedov <b>Canal</b> <b>embankments</b> the bridge was completely rebuilt again. Since then it has its modern look.|$|R
50|$|Lock No. 1 and {{a section}} of the {{original}} North Branch Canal in Northumberland were intact in 1986 as was Lock No. 2 below Bloomsburg. Occasional sections of canal bed remained between Shickshinny and West Nanticoke, and the West Nanticoke guard lock was intact. Canal bed was visible from the Lackawanna River toward Ransom and largely intact above Vosburg between Lackawanna Campground and Horse Race Falls. At Laceyville a museum known as the Oldest House was once a lockkeeper's house. Other remnants such as crib work, <b>canal</b> <b>embankments,</b> iron spikes, and timbers could be found here and there along the full length of the canal.|$|R

50|$|The canal {{opened to}} {{transport}} in 1831 {{and became an}} important partner in the economy of south Georgia. Its impact on the lumber trade was particularly important {{with one of the}} nation’s largest sawmills located along the canal’s basin. Cotton, rice, bricks, guano, naval stores, peaches, and other goods also traversed the canal. Later in the century, the canal suffered a gradual decline. Heavy June rains seriously damaged the <b>canal</b> <b>embankments</b> in 1876 coupled with a yellow fever epidemic which fatally inflicted over 1,000 individuals. The canal had become more a public health nuisance than an economic asset. By the early 1890s, the canal ceased to operate as a transportation corridor as the Central of Georgia Railway brought various wharves, warehouses, and canal frontage properties.|$|R
40|$|The use {{of water}} in history {{produced}} many singular situations, determining quality and value of landscapes. In particular, the water made useful for productive processes built the soil of vast territories realizing specific infrastructures where features and potentials are progressively layered, defined by rules and restrictions of a crucial morphological structure. The land reclamation landscape, configured {{by the process of}} drainage and irrigation, shows a composition of elements articulated as a production system, where the constituting form appears both resource and heritage for a sustainable development. Those lands are part of a landscape realized by a qualifying shape designed for the water control. Architectures and technical elements together with the network of <b>canals,</b> <b>embankments</b> and roads, that generated them, included some unusual stratification but they now need to assess their compatibility with future scenarios. Places of land reclamation interpret minimum gradients outlined by <b>canals,</b> <b>embankments,</b> draining pumps, drainage basin described by rows of trees, different textures of fields, dotted with farmhouses, silos, factories or broken by villages and some urban centres, which often overload the artificial soil over its mechanical possibilities, sometimes producing critical situations. That cultural legacy, that still has an active form in the transformation of landscape, will be investigated {{through the eyes of the}} architect that aims to highlight and systematize multiple values since they can be articulated in a singular integrated balance. The re-reading of some Italian reclamation landscapes identified in Veneto and Lazio regions finds in the comparison between different geographical and cultural contexts, a relationship of the heritage values with the systemic-infrastructural ones among places, architectures and technical constructions, useful to outline strategies and practices for a sustainable transformation and enhancement of water landscapes...|$|R

5000|$|This is {{possible}} by re-engineering {{of the left}} canal to reverse its water flow direction from the location (near [...] ) where Godavari water would be pumped into this <b>canal.</b> The <b>canal</b> <b>embankments</b> would be raised to facilitate flow reversing towards Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir and intermediate pumping stations (with low head & high flow concrete volute pumps) would be installed near the Paleru balancing reservoir, Pedda Devulapalli balancing reservoir, left canal head regulator {{on the rim of}} Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir and the existing major aqueducts across Halia, Musi and Munneru tributaries. The cost of this canal redesigning and the associated pump houses would be one third of a new scheme to transfer Godavari river water into Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir at its FRL 590 ft MSL with least possible total pumping head. The above re-engineering of the canal is similar to modifications carried out to reverse the water flow of ancient Grand canal under Eastern Route project of South to North Water Transfer in China.|$|R

40|$|Geotechnical {{engineering}} {{applications such}} as land reclamation, construction of highway, railway and <b>canal</b> <b>embankments</b> require a very large quantity of soil of desirable properties. But {{due to the lack}} of good soil, a geotechnical engineer is forced to use the locally available problematic soils (having low shear strength high compressibility and swelling nature) after stabilizing the same with the addition of admixtures. To overcome the difficulties experienced with problematic soils in geotechnical applications, an attempt is made in this study to explore the possibilities of utilizing polypropylene fibre to improve the engineering behaviour of problematic soils. Polypropylene fibre is produced in large quantities in the synthetic industries. In this study three types of problematic clays are selected to mix the polypropylene fibre at different proportions varying from 0 %, 0. 5 %, 1 %, 1. 5 % and 2 % with the soils. The index properties with increasing percentage polypropylene fibre are studied and the results are analyzed. From the results it is concluded that an optimum percentage of 1 % may be used to improve the strength characteristics of the soil...|$|R

40|$|Bac Lieu is {{a coastal}} {{province}} the Mekong River Delta (MRD), Vietnam. Aside from salinity intrusion from the sea, the province is strongly affected by acidic pollution as 58 % {{of the area}} (250, 000 ha) is overlaid with acid sulphate soil (ASS). Previous studies showed that the eminent sea level rise (SLR) would influence the hydrology and salinity of the canal networks in the province. This study, using the previously validated hydraulic and water quality model VRSAP-ACIDITY (Vietnam River Systems And Plains, coupled with ACIDITY Module), aimed at quantifying impacts of different SLR scenarios (SLR = 17, 30, 50, or 75 cm) on acidic pollution in the province. Under the present sea level, widespread acidic pollution (pH < 5) of surface water occurred {{at the start of}} the rainy season, due to leaching of acidity from <b>canal</b> <b>embankments</b> and fields in ASS. The acceleration of SLR reduced the area of acidic polluted water. The lessening in acidic pollution was attributed to (1) SLR that raised the water level in the Mekong River, increasing the amount of fresh water flowing into the study area; and (2) the amount of water drained out of the study area increased, bringing with its acidity. It concluded that SLR has a positive effect on acidic pollution in the ASS coastal area...|$|R
40|$|Volume {{changes of}} natural and {{compacted}} soils induced by changes in their water content have many practical implications in the service life of earth dams, river and <b>canal</b> <b>embankments,</b> and waste disposal facilities. An insight into the overall strain response of a clayey soil upon gradual wetting and drying is provided here. Experimental data coming from oedometer and isotropic tests under suction and net stress control are presented for a compacted clay with an initial anisotropic fabric, highlighting the relevant {{role played by the}} hydraulic path on collapse, swelling, and shrinkage strains. Irreversible strains could be observed after wetting-drying paths and the subsequent drying-wetting cycle. Both stress and hydraulic histories {{play a role in the}} evolution of the directional fabric of clayey soils. The experimental data could be reproduced with a rather simple elastic-plastic constitutive model with a mixed isotropic-rotational hardening, previously conceived for saturated soils. The model is extended to unsaturated conditions by substituting the saturated effective stress with a measure of the average stress acting on the soil skeleton and by introducing generalized hardening rules governed by both plastic strains and degree of saturation. Coupling between the mechanical and the hydraulic behavior is provided by the water retention curve, in which degree of saturation is adopted as a useful measure of the soil water content...|$|R
