40|$|Learning objectives: 1. To reviewthe role of {{exercise}} testing and exercise prescription {{in children with}} <b>childhood</b> onset <b>disability</b> or chronic conditions. 2. To present new research outcomes concerning the assessment and importance of sedentary behaviour. 3. To discuss the future interventions aimed at health promotion across the lifespan for individuals with <b>childhood</b> onset <b>disability</b> or chronic conditions. Description: Presenters in this symposium will review and discuss issues concerning both activity and in activity in children and adults with <b>childhood</b> onset <b>disability</b> and chronic conditions. Due to advances in the medical approach, mortality rates and medical outcomes in <b>childhood</b> onset <b>disability</b> and chronic conditions have improved {{over the last years}} and most of these children can now be expected to live to be adults. 3, 4 This requires a different approach in management of these patients from childhood through adolescence into adulthood, not only focusing on the pathological aspects, but also at the preventable consequences of the disease (Simeonsson, 2002). As a result, physical activity and its presumed importance in achieving adequate levels of,fitness and health are increasingly important for youth with <b>disability</b> and <b>childhood</b> conditions. Indeed, literature suggests interventions promoting healthy and active lifestyle should ideally start before the transition from youth to adulthood (Magnussen, 2013). Despite the well-known health benefits, many children and adolescents with <b>childhood</b> onset <b>disability</b> and chronic conditions show decreased levels of participation in physical activity. Dr. Takken will discuss the positive evidence of training, {{but at the same time}} these studies show maintaining adequate levels of physical activity after training seems difficult (Verschuren, 2007, de Groot, 2011, van Brussel, 2011). Therefore dr. Maher and dr. Wiar will present different approaches aimed at improving physical activity across the lifespan of individuals with <b>childhood</b> onset <b>disability</b> and <b>childhood</b> conditions (Maltais, 2010). When developing these types of interventions, identifying factors within this population and their parents, healthcare providers and teachers to what they perceive to be barriers and facilitators to be and stay physically active seems crucial (Shields, 2009). Another issue to be considered is the role of inactivity. While the emphasis over the last two decades has been on moderate to vigorous exercise when designing activity and exercise programs, emerging evidence suggests that sedentary behaviour is distinctly different from a lack of moderate to vigorous physical activity, and has independent and different physiological mechanisms. During this symposium, dr. Verschuren will discusses what we know about sedentary behaviour of children and adolescents with CP, and which future research directions are needed to build foundational knowledge in this area. Implications/conclusions: This international group in (pediatric) physical therapy and exercise physiology has made important contributions in the research area of assessment of physical activity, physical fitness, designing exercise interventions, identifying factors for reduced participation in physical activity and health promotion in individuals with <b>childhood</b> onset <b>disability</b> and chronic conditions. At the same time the group works closely together with (pediatric) physical therapist in order to guarantee the evidence is relevant and applicable to the daily practice of physical therapists. During this symposium interventions and assessment relevant to improve health outcomes and participation in physical activity for persons with <b>childhood</b> onset <b>disability</b> and chronic conditions across the lifespan.
