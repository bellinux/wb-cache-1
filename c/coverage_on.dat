5|$|A {{member of}} Fox's Standards and Practices {{department}} was flown {{out to the}} episode's Vancouver, British Columbia filming location. She was asked to watch the episode being produced {{to ensure that it}} did not breach any of the network's censorship rules. Several of the scenes that were being produced required quite small spaces during filming, requiring Nutter to record additional <b>coverage</b> <b>on</b> a handheld camera, which he later played back to the Standards and Practices liaison for approval.|$|E
5|$|Amongst {{local media}} outlets, only Apple Daily and Ming Pao ran <b>coverage</b> <b>on</b> their front pages initially, while other local {{newspapers}} carried only brief pieces about a missing person. Television viewers remarked that TVB {{did not run}} the story during its prime time news programmes {{for the first few}} days after news of the Lee Bo disappearance broke. Lee Bo's disappearance spurred renewed interest about Lam Wing-kee, and his family received a police visit the same day after chief executive CY Leung spoke publicly on the case.|$|E

The dense forest <b>coverage</b> <b>on</b> the other hand facilitated gathering and was more amenable to the raising of farm animals, which involved {{all of the major}} species, including in particular the small, forest type horses. The horses constituted an important element of the Baltic tribes' culture – men of the upper socioeconomic status were often buried with their horses and even together with their fancy horsemanship gear.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, ESPN held {{broadcast}} rights, with 66 {{hours of}} English-language coverage across ESPN and ESPN2, 44 hours on Longhorn Network, 200 hours of Spanish-language <b>coverage</b> <b>on</b> ESPN Deportes, and streaming on WatchESPN. ESPN broadcast from studios at Corus Quay, which {{was linked to}} the IBC (and in turn, ESPN's headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut). ESPN and ESPN Deportes used their own hosts, as well of those of CBC, as part of its multi-platform coverage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} part of the season, Smith {{increased}} his role and was elevated over Isaiah Williams as the number-two receiver across from Darrius Heyward-Bey. Head coach Ralph Friedgen explained that his presence would alleviate the <b>coverage</b> <b>on</b> Heyward-Bey and praised Smith's blocking ability in the running game. Against Florida State, Smith broke the school record for single-season kickoff return yards, previously held by cornerback Josh Wilson. He had 119all-purpose yards, including one 13-yard reception. Smith posted his season-best performance against 21st-ranked Boston College with 245all-purpose yards and eight receptions for 115yards and a touchdown.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} adsorbed S at {{different}} <b>coverages</b> <b>on</b> the adhesion of Fe(110) surfaces in match and mismatch is examined using density functional theory (DFT). S is adsorbed in atop, bridge, and 4 -fold hollow sites {{on one side}} of the interface in c(2 x 2) and p(1 x 1) arrangements, corresponding to coverages of 1 / 2 and 1 monolayer, respectively. The calculated adhesion energy values at different interfacial separations are fitted to the universal binding energy relation [Rose et al. Phys. Rev. B 1983, 28, 1835], and the effect of the S <b>coverages</b> <b>on</b> the adhesive strength is analyzed. The effect of relaxation of the interfaces at equilibrium is also investigated, and the resulting interfacial structures and related magnetic and charge density properties are compared...|$|R

Chinese journalists and dissidents said the Central Propaganda Department had instructed media to censor or otherwise under-report on Liu Xiaobo and the peace prize award.|$|E

5|$|On September 18, the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued heavy {{rainfall}} and wind warnings for portions of southern Ontario. A gale warning was also issued for Lake Ontario, eastern Lake Erie, the Saint Lawrence River and Georgian Bay. A news report on September 14 warned conditions could {{be similar to}} the disaster caused by Hurricane Hazel 49years prior, resulting in widespread media <b>coverage</b> <b>on</b> the hurricane. Researchers on a Convair 580 flight studied the structure of Isabel transitioning into an extratropical storm, after two similar studies for Hurricane Michael in 2000 and Tropical Storm Karen in 2001. While flying in a thunderstorm, ice build forced the plane to descend.|$|E
5|$|Population declines of 50% in the Terre Adélie {{region have}} been {{observed}} due to increased adult mortality, especially of males, during an abnormally prolonged warm period in the late 1970s, which resulted in reduced sea-ice <b>coverage.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, egg hatching success rates declined when the sea-ice extent increased. The species is therefore considered to be highly sensitive to climatic changes. In 2009, the Dion Islands colony, which has been extensively studied since 1948, {{was reported to have}} disappeared at some point over the previous decade, the first confirmed loss of a colony.|$|E
5|$|Project Chanology {{began its}} {{campaign}} by organizing and delivering {{a series of}} denial-of-service attacks against Scientology websites and flooding Scientology centers with prank calls and black faxes. The group was successful in taking down local and global Scientology websites intermittently from January 18, 2008 until at least January 25, 2008. Anonymous had early success rendering major Scientology websites inaccessible and leaking documents allegedly stolen from Scientology computers.

5|$|Redundant {{staff members}} are often laid off {{as part of}} the {{consolidation}} process, and the sharing of news content reduces the number of unique editorial voices in the market.

5|$|The CPJ International Press Freedom Awards honor journalists {{or their}} {{publications}} {{around the world}} who show courage in defending press freedom despite facing attacks, threats, or imprisonment.
