40|$|Abstract—The {{electromechanical}} brake (EMB) force control {{problem has been}} approached in prior work using cascaded proportional-integral (PI) control with embedded feedback loops to regulate <b>clamp</b> force, <b>motor</b> velocity, and motor current/torque. However, this is shown to provide limited performance for an EMB {{when faced with the}} challenges of actuator saturation, load-depen-dent friction, and nonlinear stiffness. There is a significant margin for improvement, and a modified control architecture is proposed using techniques of gain scheduling, friction compensation, and feedback linearization. A further improvement is then achieved by incorporating a model predictive control that better utilizes the available motor torque. Simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the improvement in performance.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{fabrication}} and experimental characterization of an electrostatic contraction beams motor that exhibits both reliable operation and high performance haracteristics. This electrostatic linear stepper micromotor is fabricated {{in a single}} polysilicon layer combining vertical trench isolation technology with standard surface micromachining. The entire motor, including two voltage-controlled clamps and eight pairs of contraction beams, fits {{in an area of}} 470 μm x 290 μm. Bidirectional stepping motion has been successfully demonstrated, generating a stroke of ± 70 μm by successively adding 10 nm steps. The motor was driven up to a cycling frequency of 80 kHz. An output force of 0. 49 mN was measured for actuation voltages of 60 V on the beams and 50 V on the <b>clamps.</b> The <b>motor</b> was run for 160 hours at a cycling frequency of 10 kHz, generating nearly 5. 8 billion steps...|$|R
50|$|The {{electrical}} equipment on the ER2 multiple units {{is similar to}} that of the late-model ER1s. Each power car has 4 traction motors connected in a series-parallel connection. The traction <b>motor</b> <b>clamp</b> voltage is controlled by means of starting resistances, as well as by changing the motors' connectivity and by field weakening. They are protected from electrical surges by various protective units: a fast-acting circuit breaker, an overload relay, a differential relay, etc. Early units also had a fuse in the traction motor circuit, but later units had more reliable protective equipment, which led to the fuse being removed as redundant.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{way to use}} these forces to produce linear motion is to arrange two such motors {{on either side of}} a single stator plate. That way the lift forces from one motor are opposite of the other, and <b>clamping</b> the two <b>motors</b> together results in there being no net sideways force (it is contained in the stress of the clamp). This is normally arranged in a C-shaped device which is hung above a vertical stator plate. Arrangements of this sort can be commonly seen on many pioneering transit systems from the 1960s, normally running through a slot {{in the middle of the}} vehicle floor.|$|R
40|$|A new control {{strategy}} has been proposed for the interleaved flyback inverter. the proposed method consists of two control strategies, they are active clamp control and phase control. Based on the output power of the PV module each converter phase of an ILFI is controlled. due to the active clamp control method the energy in the leakage inductance can be fully recycled. the concept of interleaving reduces the ripple and reduces the usage of capacitors. The induction motor drive has been used the speed performance of the drive has been analyzed. simulations are done using MATLAB. The parameters are analyzed without PV and with PV.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the effect of electrical stimulation on nerve regeneration in sciatic crush injury model in rabbits. Sixteen New Zealand male rabbits, allocated into two equal groups were used in the study. All rabbits were anaesthetized, their sciatic nerves were exposed and crush injury was induced with Bulldog <b>clamps.</b> Distal <b>motor</b> nerve latency, Compound Muscle Action Potential recorded by the distal part of crush point (dCMAP), Compound Muscle Action Potential recorded by the proximal part of crush point (pCMAP) was recorded and Nerve Conduction Velocity (NCV) was estimated before and just after the crush injury. Electrical stimulation was performed for 90 times every day for 3 weeks. At the 21 st day all rabbits were anaesthetized and their sciatic nerves were exposed and the same electrophysiological examination was carried out respectively. Distal motor nerve latency, dCMAP, pCMAP and NCV were not significantly different between groups (p> 0. 05). In conclusion, our study did not support the idea that was about performing electrical stimulation to injured nerves could increase regeneration. However, the higher amplitude of dCMAP in the experiment group at the end of the study can be accepted as a positive point for electrostimulation on nerve injury...|$|R
50|$|The {{traction}} motors are {{mounted on the}} truck frames (see above), which protects them from impact when rolling over rail joints and reduces the train's unsprung weight. The first ER2s had the same DK-106B {{traction motors}} as the ER1; these were DC series motors (the armature and field windings were connected in series, as is normal for variable-speed DC motors) with 4 main and 4 auxiliary poles and wavy armature windings. The <b>motor's</b> <b>clamp</b> voltage was 1500 V, and the insulation was designed for 3000 V (which gave a 2-fold safety margin). Unlike locomotive traction motors, these motors normally operated in weak field, with maximum field strength used only during acceleration. The motors are self-cooling (the cooling fan is fixed on the motor's output shaft); the cooling air is taken in through air intakes above the passenger doors.|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{numerical}} simulations {{and experimental}} measurements {{carried out on}} a high-power ultrasonic motor are presented. The proposed motor is composed of an annular shaped stator and two cone-shaped rotors. The rotors are pressed {{into contact with the}} edges of the inner surface of the stator by means of a pre-stress system. A traveling rotating wave is generated in the stator by three pairs of Langevin transducers suitably shifted both in space and time. Each transducer is designed to excite radial nonaxisymmetric modes in the ring. The motor has been effectively clamped to the housing by using two flanges passing through the middle plane of 2 transducers. Finite element analysis was employed to evaluate two different configurations of the motor, both using 6 driving transducers, and to analyze the effect of the flange on the design and on the performance of the transducer. Experimental measurements carried out on a manufactured prototype show that the proposed motor exhibits greatly improved performance in terms of output torque and mechanical power compared with similar previous prototypes which use fewer driving transducers and a different <b>clamping</b> system. The <b>motor</b> weighed 0. 67 kg, and had a working frequency of 23. 6 kHz, maximum rotational speed of 116 rpm, and static torque of 0. 94 Nm...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} three and five level diode <b>clamped</b> inverters for <b>motor</b> drive applications. The work was completed as a PhD project at the University of Nottingham with funding from EPSRC and Heenan Drives Ltd. The investigation of the three level converter describes the design, development, control and operation of an 11 kW prototype. Included in the design is a review of typical switching strategies employed {{for control of the}} output voltage. New improvements to the sub-harmonic pulse width modulation method are presented which allow an improved output waveform to be obtained. The problem of DC link capacitor voltage balancing (Neutral Point Control) is addressed and a novel balancing control method is presented based on the addition of a DC offset to the modulation pattern. This method is verified through mathematical analysis and experimental operation. The operational limits of the control are analysed. Improvements to the technique are presented to expand its operating limits. The development of a prototype five level converter is then described. The design again features improvements to the sub-harmonic modulation strategy to provide enhanced output waveform generation, particularly for transient operation. The current demands on the DC link capacitors for the five level arrangement are analysed and it is concluded that the capacitors cannot be regulated by simple modifications to the output switching pattern. A novel circuit is presented to achieve capacitor balancing within the DC link. The circuit behaviour is described and analysed. Operation is confirmed through simulation and experimental implementation. High dynamic performance is demonstrated via the use of a vector controlled induction motor. Neutral point control is successfully achieved through a similar method to that used for the three level inverter. Having demonstrated the principle of operation of the three and five level inverters on low voltage prototypes, the thesis concludes with a review of the main considerations required to implement the configurations as medium voltage drives...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: Insulin-like {{growth factor}} 1 {{has been shown}} to be cytoprotective against ischemia-reperfusion injury in various organs. However, spinal cord {{protection}} by insulin-like growth factor 1 has not been tested. We have therefore examined the effect of insulin-like growth factor 1 on neuronal cell death and motor function after spinal cord ischemia. Methods: Japanese white rabbits were subjected to spinal cord ischemia by clamping the abdominal aorta for 15 minutes. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (0. 3 mg/kg) at a dose equipotent to insulin (0. 3 IU/kg) in lowering blood glucose level or the control (phosphate-buffered saline solution as a vehicle) was administered intravenously 30 minutes before the aortic <b>clamp.</b> Results: Hind-limb <b>motor</b> function had recovered normally 48 hours after the operation in all the rabbits (n = 8) treated with insulin-like growth factor 1. In contrast, all the control-treated (n = 8) and all but one of the insulin-treated (n = 6) rabbits had deteriorated to paraplegia by 48 hours after the operation. Histopathologic sections in the involved spinal cord segment showed that a significantly (P <. 0001) greater number of motor neuron cells were preserved in the rabbits treated with insulin-like growth factor 1 (17. 9 ± 4. 8 per section) than in those treated with the control (8. 0 ± 2. 1). Although insulin was equipotent to insulin-like growth factor 1 in preserving the number of motor neuron cells (18. 5 ± 2. 7), the percentage of motor neuron cells positive for terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase–mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick-end labeling were significantly (P <. 01) smaller in the rabbits treated with insulin-like growth factor 1 (6. 0 ± 4. 6) compared with those treated with the control (54. 6 ± 33. 8) and insulin (26. 2 ± 11. 7). Immunohistochemical studies revealed that insulin-like growth factor 1 increased expression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-xL protein and inhibited expression of the proapoptotic Bax protein in motor neuron cells 24 and 48 hours after the operation. In contrast, expression of only Bax was increased after the operation in other groups of rabbits subjected to spinal cord ischemia. Conclusions: These results suggest that insulin-like growth factor 1, but not insulin with a conventional dose, protects motor neuron cells from ischemic spinal cord injury associated with differential regulation of Bcl-xL and Bax protein.

5000|$|In 1950 Mercury {{engineers}} {{came out}} with the Super 10 Hurricane, Model KG-7. This motor was based on previous models KE-7 Lightning and KF-7 Super 10. Upgrades included redesigned connecting rods, upgraded aluminum clamp and swivel brackets, a new high RPM magneto, improved porting, an 8 Reed valve cage (as opposed to KE-7 and KF-7’s 4) and larger crankcase opening. Hurricane was also advertised at 10 hp*, way below the actual horsepower developed, Mercury noted this asterisk by stating that horsepower varies with rpm; really the Hurricane could deliver up to 18 hp. Shortly after the introduction of the Hurricane, Mercury came up with their first performance gear case with the capability of mating to a standard driveshaft housing of a KG-7 or similar green top engine of the time. This was named “Quicksilver” and promised an extra 20 to 30% increase in top speed. Essentially, it boasted a significantly slimmer pointed gear case that housed an integrated rubber rotex water pump and forward only 1:1 gears along with the necessary bearings. After a few months of use, Mercury found that the average race boat's transom would not elevate the standard driveshaft housing and quicksilver gear case high enough for peak performance. Rectifying this problem, Mercury developed the Quicksilver driveshaft housing. This new driveshaft housing was three inches shorter which in turn lowered the motor's center of gravity on the boat which helped turning ability, reduced the strain on the boat's transom and <b>motor's</b> <b>clamp</b> brackets, and decreased underwater drag while increasing top speed as less gearcase was below the boat. In addition the motor had a sort-of cut down lower anti-cavitation plate, protruding forward upper anti-cavitation plate (spray plate), a stronger rear-mounted steering bar design, and finally, an exhaust opening above the water surface that reduced exhaust back pressure while increasing noise levels when the boat was on plane. When the dealer installed the quicksilver driveshaft housing and gear case (packaged at $82.25) he had authorization to hand stamp a small [...] "Q" [...] behind the serial numbers on the tag and block. Some did, some did not - and so, the [...] "Stamped Q" [...] came to be. 1951 saw the first production race-ready outboard models; KG-4Q, KG7-Q, and KG-9Q. These motors were pulled off the production line at random, given the quicksilver gear case, driveshaft housing, and [...] "Q" [...] stamp behind the tag serial number and block serial number. These KG-7Qs worked fine on runabouts but were too long for hydroplanes - and the racers made this known to Mercury. So thus was born the 2" [...] shorter [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing in 1952. Right before Mercury released this [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing, they still had several [...] "Q" [...] length driveshaft housings, so they introduced a factory KG-7Q which had a green silk screened Q behind the serial number on the tag and a factory stamped [...] "Q" [...] on the block. These motors are very rare; they fall into the serial range of 532404-532963.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the cell biology of tendons and their {{response}} to in vitro tensile strain {{with a view to}} elucidating how cells sense mechanical load and what changes occur to the cells in response. This work was done in order to provide some scientific background to aid the improvement of strategies for the treatment and prevention of tendon damage and develop appropriate methodologies related to the mechanical stimulation of tissue engineered tendons. A miniature cyclic straining device was designed (in collaboration with Electrical Engineering) which utilised a 50 ml centrifuge tube containing two clamps, controlled via a stepper motor. This was programmed using Visual Basic enabling a defined magnitude and duration of strain to be applied to the tissue or monolayer of cells within the incubator. The design offered numerous benefits over the more commonly-used commercially available bioreactors; in that the system was relatively inexpensive to make, multiple repeats could be carried out simultaneously, only comparatively small amounts of media were required and, as the device was small, it could be kept in the incubator {{for the duration of the}} experiment. This design was developed further by re-orientating the <b>clamps</b> and stepper <b>motor</b> to create a horizontal device which could be placed in a Petri-dish and used with a dipping lens con focal microscope to image the response of cells to strain in real-time. Due to the variability in primary cell attachment to the PLA surfaces, alternative methods of cell seeding were investigated. Cytocentrifugation provided a reliable method of attaching a pre-determined number of cells to the surface; cells had an improved plating efficiency and less variation in distribution, whilst remaining viable. This method was also tested on Azowipes tm, which were used as a model 3 D scaffold in order to see whether this method had potential for use in tissue engineering. Cells penetrated to the centre of the scaffold, in the order of mm's, an improved penetration compared to the gravity-seeded controls. Cells continued to produce collagen and synthesise DNA after cytocentrifugation onto the 3 D scaffold. Monolayer cultures of cells on collagen-coated PLA were exposed to cyclic mechanical strain in the custom-made mechanical straining devices. The effect of specific durations and magnitude of strains on cell number was compared to mono layers of cells which were either maintained in an unloaded state or experienced static tensile strain. However, monolayer cultures of cells do not accurately represent in vivo cell behaviour, as proliferation is much increased in 20 cultures as opposed to what is seen physiologically in tendon tissue. For this reason, intact rat tail tendon fascicles were investigated as they have a regular and relatively uniform composition and the cells remain in their native extracellular matrix. In situ 3 D information regarding the cells residing in intact tail tendon fascicles under tension was obtained using multiphoton microscopy. Mechanical stress was applied to the fascicles and a wavelength of 900 nm was used to image tendon cells stained with Acridine Orange whilst simultaneously imaging the collagen extracellular matrix using Second Harmonic Generation. The data was then used to inform 'The Virtual Tendon Project' about local variations in strain and demonstrated the requirement for 3 D image processing to reliably describe local strains in the matrix. Cell proliferation in response to mechanical stimulation was studied by the uptake of EdU, a relatively new method which was optimised for tendon tissue (Way et al., 20 I 0). The EdU technology, together with histological sectioning, was used to study the effects of obesity and age on tendons in vivo. Rats were fed a high fat diet and tendons from the tail, Achilles and patellar were dissected. Fewer collagen fibres with greater inter-fibrillar spaces were seen in the histological sections taken from the Achilles of the rats fed a high fat diet and the cells had a greater proliferative index than those of the control. In the ageing studies a decrease in cell area and an increase in proliferative index were apparent in the Achilles of the mature rat compared to the 2 month old rat. The methodologies developed in this project predominantly use the simple tendons of the tail to help describe how cells residing in tendon respond to mechanical strain and together with 'The Virtual Tendon Project' go some way towards describing the complex 3 D local strain environment present in this tissue.
