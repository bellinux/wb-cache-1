5|$|The Rev. Edward Barlow {{invented the}} rack and snail {{striking}} mechanism for striking clocks, {{which was a}} great improvement over the previous mechanism. The repeating <b>clock,</b> <b>that</b> chimes {{the number of hours}} (or even minutes) was invented by either Quare or Barlow in 1676. George Graham invented the deadbeat escapement for clocks in 1720.|$|E
5|$|Screenshots of Zelda: Gaiden {{released}} in August 1999 show unmistakable {{elements of the}} final version of Majora's Mask, such as the large <b>clock</b> <b>that</b> dominates the center of Clock Town, the timer {{at the bottom of the}} screen, and the Goron Mask. Story and gameplay details revealed later that month show that the story concept as well as the use of transformation masks were already in place.|$|E
5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital <b>clock</b> <b>that</b> appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E

5|$|A major {{stimulus}} {{to improving the}} accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a <b>clock</b> <b>that</b> lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The marine chronometer would {{have to keep the}} time of a fixed location—usually Greenwich Mean Time—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing the local high noon to the clock. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.|$|E
5|$|It {{is mounted}} on a {{rectangular}} cast-iron column of two-tons weight that rests on the masonry pier. Through a glass door in the column {{you can see the}} driving <b>clock</b> <b>that</b> keeps the telescope turning westward just as fast as the stars go, so that a star remains in view as long as the astronomer wishes to observe it. The telescope turns on two axes {{at the top of the}} column. One axis slants upwards toward the north pole of the heavens; the other at right angles to it, and it is to this one that the tube of the telescope is attached. Two large circles provide graduated scales for locating objects by their coordinates. The instrument can be turned on these axes toward any part of the sky. It is a heavy instrument, but so perfectly balanced that the astronomer moves it easily with one hand.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of clocks in {{writings of the}} 11th century implies that they were well known in Europe in that period. In the early 14th-century, the Florentine poet Dante Alighieri referred to a clock in his Paradiso; the first known literary reference to a <b>clock</b> <b>that</b> struck the hours. Giovanni da Dondi, Professor of Astronomy at Padua, presented the earliest detailed description of clockwork in his 1364 treatise Il Tractatus Astrarii. This has inspired several modern replicas, including some in London's Science Museum and the Smithsonian Institution. Other notable examples from this period were built in Milan (1335), Strasbourg (1354), Lund (1380), Rouen (1389), and Prague (1462).|$|E

40|$|Intertidal {{animals are}} faced with strong rhythmic {{environmental}} signals on both daily and tidal frequencies, and their behavioral output is often complex because these two competing influences affect the endogenous <b>clocks</b> <b>that</b> drive their behaviors. This chapter reviews {{the nature of the}} <b>clocks</b> <b>that</b> govern the behaviors in intertidal organisms as well as the inputs and outputs from these clocks. The relative importance of the environmental factors that synchronize these rhythms is discussed, as well as the different types of physiological and bhavioral outputs that have been observed. The molecular underpinnings of the circadian clocks are presented as well as the hypothesis <b>that</b> the <b>clocks</b> <b>that</b> drive circatidal rhythms are composed of the same molecular 2 ̆ 2 machinery 2 ̆ 2 used by circadian clocks...|$|R
5|$|The Emirates Stadium pays {{tribute to}} Arsenal's former home, Highbury. The club's offices are officially called Highbury House, located {{north-east}} of Emirates Stadium, and house the bust of Herbert Chapman that used to reside at Highbury. Three other busts that used to reside at Highbury of Claude Ferrier (architect of Highbury's East stand), Denis Hill-Wood (former Arsenal chairman) and manager Arsène Wenger have also been moved to Emirates Stadium and are in display in {{the entrance of the}} Diamond Club. Additionally, the two bridges over the railway line to the east of the stadium, connecting the stadium to Drayton Park, are called the Clock End and North Bank bridges, after the stands at Highbury; the <b>clock</b> <b>that</b> gave its name to the old Clock End has been resited on the new clock end which features a newer, larger replica of the clock. The Arsenal club museum, which was formerly held in the North Bank Stand, opened in October 2006 and is located {{to the north of the}} stadium, within the Northern Triangle building. It houses the marble statues that were once held in the marble halls of Highbury.|$|E
5|$|The first geared {{clock was}} invented in the 11th century by the Arab {{engineer}} Ibn Khalaf al-Muradi in Islamic Iberia; it was a water <b>clock</b> <b>that</b> employed a complex gear train mechanism, including both segmental and epicyclic gearing, capable of transmitting high torque. The clock was unrivalled in its use of sophisticated complex gearing, until the mechanical clocks of the mid-14th century. Al-Muradi's clock also employed the use of mercury in its hydraulic linkages, which could function mechanical automata. Al-Muradi's work was known to scholars working under Alfonso X of Castile, hence the mechanism {{may have played a}} role in the development of the European mechanical clocks. Other monumental water clocks constructed by medieval Muslim engineers also employed complex gear trains and arrays of automata. Like the earlier Greeks and Chinese, Arab engineers at the time also developed a liquid-driven escapement mechanism which they employed in some of their water clocks. Heavy floats were used as weights and a constant-head system was used as an escapement mechanism, which was present in the hydraulic controls they used to make heavy floats descend at a slow and steady rate.|$|E

2500|$|Most Japanese clocks {{were driven}} by weights. However, the Japanese were also aware of, and {{occasionally}} made, <b>clocks</b> <b>that</b> ran from springs. [...] Like the western lantern <b>clocks</b> <b>that</b> inspired their design, the weight driven clocks were often {{held up by}} specially built tables or shelves that allowed the weights to drop beneath them. [...] Spring driven Japanese clocks were made for portability; the smallest were the size of large watches, and carried by their owners in inrō pouches.|$|R

25|$|The quartz {{clock is}} a <b>clock</b> <b>that</b> keeps time {{by using an}} {{electronic}} oscillator regulated by a quartz crystal.

James Keene of Woodstock cast the 1628 and 1629 bells. The tower had also an historic turret <b>clock</b> <b>that</b> may have been made early in the 17th century.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} method for {{reducing}} the number of clocks of a timed automaton by combining two algorithms.
