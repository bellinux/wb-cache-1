40|$|BACKGROUND: When {{composite}} arterial T-grafts are used, uncertainty persists as {{to whether}} the RIMA will be long enough to reach the RCA. We present a formula for the preoperative estimation of the required <b>conduit</b> <b>length.</b> METHODS: The following formula was created to estimate the required <b>conduit</b> <b>length</b> for a sequential graft, starting from the proximal RIMA-LIMA T-graft anastomosis, passing the PLA, and ending at the PDA: 2. 14 x ([2 x LV wall thickness [WT]) + end-diastolic diameter (EDD) ]. The estimated length was compared to the measured length in 100 patients undergoing off-pump revascularisation with BIMA T-grafts. RESULTS: There were no hospital deaths, no major infarctions and no wound complications. The required <b>conduit</b> <b>length</b> varied from 11. 5 cm to 19 cm (average 14. 9 +/- 1. 4 cm) and was excellently predicted by the formula (paired T-test: P > 0. 001, r = 0. 86, average overestimation: 0. 55 cm). CONCLUSION: The formula reliably determines the minimum required <b>conduit</b> <b>length.</b> We recommend this formula for preoperative decision making when considering the choice of graft and the length of RIMA harvesting. To facilitate calculation a simplified version is useful: 2 x EDD + 4 x WD + 1. Avoiding uncertainty about the sufficiency of the RIMA length may contribute to the spread of this technique...|$|E

The stirrer {{can operate}} as a stand-alone component {{or it can be}} incorporated into a MHD-controlled network. The stirrer consists of a conduit equipped with individually controlled electrodes positioned along its opposing walls. The conduit is filled with an electrolyte solution and positioned in a uniform magnetic field. When a potential difference is applied across pairs or groups of electrodes, the resulting current interacts with the magnetic field to induce Lorentz forces and fluid motion.

To elucidate their relationships, the fundamental frequencies of the 10 -s simulated waveforms observed at ACM were examined (Fig. 9 c; Additional file 2). For example, for τ = 0.16 s, the estimated fundamental frequency was nearly constant at approximately 2.3 – 2.5 Hz when the <b>conduit</b> <b>length</b> was short (L < 10 m). This frequency of ∼ 2 Hz gradually decreased to ∼ 0.37 Hz at L = 200 m. Under other initial conditions (τ = 0.31, 0.78, and 1.55 s), the estimated fundamental frequencies of the waveforms showed the same change curves.

30|$|Since the {{accurate}} conduit size is not known, we introduced {{a range of}} radius, from 5 m to 20 m, based on the first eyewitness’ observation of the lava dome on January 28 (Nakada et al., 2013). With respect to {{the depth of the}} magma chamber, we refer to a joint analysis of GPS (Global Positioning System) data by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI), the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Mitigation (NIED), and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). According to the joint analysis, the depth of a co-eruptive deflation source was reported by GSI (2012) as being 6.2 km. All the estimates for the geodetic source depth (GSI, 2012; Kozono et al., 2013; Nakao et al., 2013; Ueda et al., 2013) are deeper than the shallower magma chamber of the hot magma. We assume the deeper magma chamber to be the lower boundary. We do {{not take into account the}} existence of the shallow magma chamber in the conduit flow calculation, but the magma flowing in the conduit is assumed to be the mixed magma generated at the shallower magma chamber (Suzuki et al., 2013). Because no significant change in the deformation source is reported during the eruption, we commonly use 6 km as the <b>conduit</b> <b>length</b> in the present paper. However, considering an argument by Slezin (2003) which discussed the critical <b>conduit</b> <b>length</b> in relation to an eruption style, we examined the effect of the <b>conduit</b> <b>length</b> by changing it from 5 to 7 km, before undertaking specific calculations.

30|$|During the 2014 – 2015 eruptions at Aso volcano in Japan, we {{successfully}} observed monochromatic infrasound tremor at {{stations around the}} crater. The peak frequency of the tremor was 0.4 – 0.7 Hz, which gradually changed over time. However, these infrasound signals were associated not only with Strombolian eruptions or ash ventings but also with emissions of gas–steam mixtures. This result suggests that the monochromatic infrasound waves we observed were mainly caused by the air resonance inside the conduit. Such resonance may have been produced by an incident pressure oscillation {{at the base of}} the conduit, such as that caused by a degassing process. We determined whether this process could occur at Aso based on a numerical calculation using the finite-difference time-domain method with accurate topography data with a resolution of 2 m. The results of this calculation indicated that the peak frequency of the monochromatic infrasound waves could be accounted for by the <b>length</b> of the <b>conduit,</b> regardless of variations in the source time function. Assuming a series of conditions on a day in March 2015, we also reproduced a waveform of the observed monochromatic infrasound signals.

A long arteriotomy and reconstruction of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) are occasionally required for complete extraction of the atherosclerotic plaque. The aim of this study was to examine early and late results of this technique and compare 2 different reconstruction methods. MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed 224 consecutive patients who underwent extensive LAD endarterectomy and reconstruction between January 1992 and March 2010. For reconstruction, 101 patients underwent saphenous vein patch and LAD grafting (group A) and 123 patients had left internal thoracic artery onlay patch grafting (group B). We compared early and late outcomes and assessed the association of the reconstruction method and long-term survival. ResultsThe mean age was 66 and 67 years in groups A and B, respectively. Operative mortality was 3. 0 % and 4. 1 %, and the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction in the LAD territory was 4. 0 % and 4. 1 % in groups A and B, respectively. There was no significant difference in early operative outcomes (P >. 05). Actuarial 5 -year survival was 78. 6 % and 87. 1 % and 10 -year survival was 45. 4 % and 49. 4 % in groups A and B, respectively.

40|$|The water {{status in}} plants is {{dependent}} on the xylem hydraulic conductance. In cut flowers, for example, the preservation of continuous hydraulic conductance is important for maintaining longer vase life, an important index for cut flower quality. Many factors, such as stomata performance, root water uptake efficiency, temperature, light quality and humidity, influence the efficiency of water transport in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum.   It has also been shown that the dimensions of the xylem conduits in the plant, such as the <b>conduit</b> <b>length,</b> diameter and density, are important for plant water transport. Therefore, the regulation of the xylem conduit size during xylogenesis is necessary for providing a particular hydraulic efficiency in a given environment. To understand the regulation of xylogenesis and the influence of the processes to produce xylem conduits of particular dimensions with specific hydraulic capacity, this thesis focuses on the Zinnia elegans tracheary element (TE) differentiation at the cellular level. It further considers the regulation of xylem conduit dimensions in whole plants by using drought stress and temperature as variable environmental factors. In Chapter 1, the mechanisms of plant water transport, as regulated by xylem conduit dimensions with consequent effect on plant quality, are reviewed. Also, the chapter provides general literature on xylem formation, Zinnia elegans as model for xylogenic research, and finally gives the outline of the thesis. In Chapter 2, two cultivars of the Zinnia elegans cut flowers, 'Envy' and 'Purple Prince', were grown in soils with different water contents with increasing water stress levels: 70, 50 and 20 %(v/v) soil water content (SWC). Plant length increased with SWC. The hydraulic efficiency in the stems of cut flowers decreased with increasing water stress. The xylem <b>conduit</b> <b>length</b> was not different between Purple Prince cut flowers from the three different water stress levels. In the Envy cultivar, a significant difference in <b>conduit</b> <b>length</b> was found between plants from 20 and 50 % (v/v) SWCs. The proportion of large-diameter conduits increased with decreasing drought stress, i. e., in cut flowers from both cultivars the proportion of large-diameter vessels was highest in the 70 % (v/v) SWC and least in the 20 % (v/v) SWC. This means that the decrease in hydraulic conductivity with water stress was largely due to the decrease in the diameter of the conduits making the <b>conduit</b> <b>length</b> less important. The vase life of the cut flowers correlated negatively with the diameter of the xylem conduits, confirming that small-diameter conduits are more efficient in overcoming embolism and therefore maintaining efficient water transport in the stems. In Chapter 3, the role of average day temperature (ADT) and difference in day and night temperature (DIF) on the length of xylem elements and conduits, and fusion of the individual elements into conduits in planta were investigated. Plant length increased significantly with ADT between 17 and 25 o C. Opposite DIF treatments resulted in different plant length at 4 and 8 o C absolute DIF. The responses to temperature differences were similar in both Zinnia cultivars, although Purple Prince cultivar plants were always bigger. The maximal vessel length (L max) and half vessel lengths (τ) both increased with increasing ADT, about 110 - 130 % increase from 17 to 25 o C ADT. However, DIF had no effect on these conduit parameters. Measurements of average lengths of individual vessel elements from plants grown at average temperatures 17 and 25 o C showed about 10 % and 20 % increase in Envy and Purple Prince respectively. This change in vessel element length constitutes {{a small part of the}} overall change in whole <b>conduit</b> <b>length,</b> and therefore, it can be deduced that the amount of vessel element fusion is more important during formation of longer xylem conduits in the plant. In Chapter 4, a method for establishing an in vitroZinnia elegans cell culture for differentiation into tracheary elements (TEs) is described. The xylogenic Zinnia system is rather unique for studying xylogenesis at the cellular level. It offers possibilities to study in detail the effects of certain factors important for regulating the xylogenesis process. The in vitro culture has been well standardized to eliminate the inconsistencies in TE differentiation that have been observed in the past. Additional methods for monitoring and measuring the important hallmarks of TE differentiation, including DNA laddering, vacuolar rupture, cellulose bands and lignin synthesis, have been treated in this section. In Chapter 5, the effect of leaf osmolarity (LO) induced by different light intensities and electrical conductivity (EC) of soil-less plant culture, on the differentiation of TEs in cell cultures from the two cultivars, Envy and Purple Prince, was investigated. Both light intensity and EC correlated with LO with a similar response, although it was always higher in the Envy cultivar. By increasing the LO, the percentage of TEs (%TE) formed also increased, with a similar trend in cultures from both cultivars. About 60 % increase in %TE was realized in the Purple Prince cultivar as compared to earlier reports by different authors. The LO of the starting material also correlated positively with the final size of the TE. This implies that the efficiency of the xylogenic Zinnia system can be improved by adaptations in the growth conditions for the starting material. In Chapter 6, we investigated the effect of osmotic stress and timed application of NAA and BA (xylem differentiating phytohormones) on the TE differentiation in cultures from the two Zinnia cultivars. The %TE increased with increasing extracellular osmotic stress until 300 mOsm, after which any additional increase resulted in a diminishing %TE. The size of the TEs increased with decreasing extracellular osmolarity within the working range of 100 to 700 mOsm. These results were similar in the cultures from both cultivars. Application of NAA/BA induced a significant increase in the rate of cell division corresponding to a similar increase in TE differentiation. It is proposed that the increase in cell division may be beneficial in providing certain bioactive materials for the development of the TEs. Delayed application of NAA/BA reduced the %TE, but with a significant increase in TE size. In Chapter 7, the role of programmed cell death (PCD) in determining the final size of the TEs and the %TE was investigated. Application of two protease inhibitors, a general caspase inhibitor (Zasp) and a cysteine protease inhibitor (E 64), to xylogenic cultures from the two cultivars, caused a significant increase in the size of TEs but 65 - 300 % decrease in %TE. There proved to be a significant delay or complete inhibition of the hallmarks of PCD, such as DNA laddering and vacuole collapse, in the cultures treated with the inhibitors. It was also found that the second stream of TE differentiation, common in non-inhibited xylogenic Zinnia cultures, was absent in cultures treated with 10 nM or higher of each of the two inhibitors. The research experiments and their outcomes in this thesis range from fundamental xylogenesis at the cellular level to whole plant water transport performance. The overall discussion of the experimental approaches, results, and their practical implications is presented in Chapter 8. This chapter also offers suggestions for future research...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{draining}} of a yield-stress fluid from a vertical vessel having a hole or a tube at its bottom. In {{order to understand}} the basic process we first study the problem with a Newtonian fluid and show that the flow characteristics can be very well described by assuming that the flow is analogous to that through a straight <b>conduit</b> of given <b>length.</b> For a yield-stress fluid draining through a hole the behaviour is different: the flow stops when the pressure drop across the orifice falls to a finite value which increases as the yield stress of the fluid increases or the hole radius R decreases. All the data collapse onto a master curve when plotted in terms of dimensionless numbers involving a characteristic length which is a function of R. We deduce an empirical model for the flow characteristics in such a case. When a length of tube is added after the hole we show that the characteristics of the flow are similar to those for flow through a straight conduit with an equivalent length equal to the tube length plus a fixed additional length...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: During {{coronary}} artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, the saphenous vein is sutured through its proximal segment to the aorta. Intimal hyperplasia is one of the possible causes of graft occlusion. Notably, blood turbulence can induce wall shear stress that may also {{play an important role in}} this process. OBJECTIVE: We propose a new technique for performing proximal anastomosis to avoid CABG failure. METHOD: An 80 kg pig was subjected to open heart surgery. Four stitches were placed in the anterior ascending aorta, which formed a 2 cm by 4 cm patch. This patch was isolated through the application of a tangential clamp that was oriented parallel to the axis of the aorta. After releasing the patch, which was held to the aorta through its cranial end pedicle, the rims were sutured to each other creating a <b>conduit</b> with a <b>length</b> of 4 cm and an internal diameter of 4 mm. The rest of the aortotomy was closed by placing a direct suture between its rims. RESULT: This novel technique created an "in situ" aortic wall graft that was 4 cm long and characterized as being of uniform 4 mm caliber...|$|R
5000|$|In November, despite press rumours that {{suggested}} he would bypass the race, Conduit traveled back to America for the Breeders' Cup, {{run for the}} second successive year at Santa Anita. He was made odds-on favourite against six opponents for the Turf. The American gelding Presious Passion led from the start and ran the first half mile in 45.14, opening up a lead of at least eight <b>lengths.</b> <b>Conduit</b> was held up before moving into second {{at the start of}} the straight, although he stumbled after colliding with the filly Dar Re Mi. Conduit's [...] "relentless charge" [...] took him past Presious Passion a furlong and a half out, and although the gelding rallied [...] "gamely", the colt won by half a length. The winning time of 2:23.75 was the second fastest recorded in the race, behind only Conduit's 2008 win. The normally taciturn Moore said of Conduit, [...] "He's very game. He's a great horse - a once in a lifetime horse". His record of two wins in the race had previously been achieved by High Chaparral, although High Chaparral's second win was achieved in a dead heat with Johar.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{use of a}} {{skeletonized}} internal thoracic artery in {{coronary artery}} bypass graft surgery has been shown to confer certain advantages over a traditional pedicled technique, particularly in certain patient groups. Recent reports indicate that radial and gastroepiploic arteries can also be harvested using a skeletonized technique. The aim {{of this study is to}} systematically review the available evidence regarding the use of skeletonized radial and gastroepiploic arteries within coronary artery bypass surgery, focusing specifically on it's effect on <b>conduit</b> <b>length</b> and flow, levels of endothelial damage, graft patency and clinical outcome. Four electronic databases were systematically searched for studies reporting the utilisation of the skeletonization technique within coronary revascularisation surgery in humans. Reference lists of all identified studies were checked for any missing publications. There appears to be some evidence that skeletonization may improve angiographic patency, when compared with pedicled vessels in the short to mid-term. We have found no suggestion of increased complication rates or increased operating time. Skeletonization may increase the length of the conduit, and the number of sequential graft sites, but no clear clinical benefits are apparent. Our study suggests that there is not enough high quality or consistent evidence to currently advocate the application of this technique to radial or gastroepiploic conduits ahead of a traditional pedicled technique. </p...|$|E
40|$|Two {{methods were}} {{evaluated}} for using centrifugal force {{to measure the}} occurrence of cavitation {{as a function of}} negative pressures in xylem. The general protocol was to measure the hydraulic conductivity of xylem segments (stem or root pieces) before and after centring them on a centrifuge rotor and spinning them about their long axis to generate negative xylem pres-sure. The percentage decrease in conductivity from the initial to final measurement was used to quan-tify the embolism resulting from cavitation during spinning. In one approach, segments were spun with their ends exposed to air. This method could only be used when xylem conduits were much shorter than the segment. Results from an angiosperm [Betula occi-dentalis) and a gymnosperm {Abies lasiocarpa) corre-sponded to previous observations of embolism caused by air dehydration where negative pressure was meas-ured with the pressure chamber. Results also agreed with embolism caused by injection of air into the xylem, in support of the air-seeding hypothesis for cavitation. In a second approach, segments were spun in a rotor designed to keep the segment ends immersed in water during spinning. This gave the same results as for non-immersed segments. Immersing the segment ends allowed measurements on any material, regardless of <b>conduit</b> <b>length,</b> as demonstrated for roots of B. occi-dentalis. The chief advantage of the centrifugal force method is the rapidity and precision with which any desired xylem pressure can be imposed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceStrombolian {{activity}} {{is characterized by}} repeated, low energy, explosions and is named after the volcano where such activity has persisted for around 2000 years, i. e., Stromboli (Aeolian Islands, Italy). Stromboli represents an excellent laboratory where measurements of such explosions {{can be made from}} safe, but close, distances. During a field campaign in 2008, two 15 [*]cm diameter bombs were quenched and collected shortly after a normal explosion. The bombs were characterized in terms of their textural, chemical, rheological, and geophysical signatures. The vesicle and crystal size distribution of the samples, coupled with the glass chemistry, enabled us to quantify variations in the degassing history and rheology of the magma resident in the shallow (i. e., in last 250 m of <b>conduit</b> <b>length).</b> The different textural facies observed in these bombs showed that fresh magma was mingled with batches of partially to completely degassed, oxidized, high-crystallinity, high-viscosity, evolved magma. This magma sat {{at the top of the}} conduit and played only a passive role in the explosive process. The fresh, microlite-poor, vesiculated batch, however, experienced a response to the explosive event, by undergoing rapid decompression. Integration of geophysical measurements with sample analyses indicates that popular bubble-bursting models may not fit this case. We suggest that the degassed, magma forms a plug, or rheological layer, at the top of the conduit, through which the fresh magma bursts. In this model we need to consider the paradox of a slug ascending too fast through a magma of varying viscosity and yield strength...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Traditional {{harvesting}} of {{the internal}} thoracic artery (ITA) {{for use as a}} conduit in coronary bypass surgery involves the dissection of a rim of tissue surrounding the artery on either side. Recent studies, primarily observational, have suggested that skeletonization of the ITA can improve <b>conduit</b> flow, increase <b>length,</b> and reduce the risk of deep sternal infection in high risk patients. Furthermore, skeletonization of the ITA can potentially preserve intercostal nerves and reduce post-operative pain and dysesthesias associated with ITA harvesting. In order to assess the effects of ITA skeletonization, we report a prospective, randomized, within-patient study design that shares many features of a cross-over study. Methods Patients undergoing bilateral internal thoracic artery harvest will be randomized to having one side skeletonized and the other harvested in a non-skeletonized manner. Outcome measures include ITA flow and length measured intra-operatively, post-operative pain and dysesthesia, evaluated at discharge, four weeks, and three months post-operatively, and sternal perfusion assessed using single photon emission computed tomography. Harvest times as well as safety endpoints of ITA injury will be recorded. Discussion This study design, using within-patient comparisons and paired analyses, minimizes the variability of the outcome measures, which is seldom possible in the evaluation of surgical techniques, with minimal chance of carryover effects that can hamper the interpretation of traditional cross-over studies. This study will provide a valid evaluation of clinically relevant effects of internal thoracic artery skeletonization in improving outcomes following coronary artery bypass surgery. </p...|$|R
40|$|Clones of Hevea {{were studied}} {{in an attempt}} to {{discover}} the reasons for differences in the hydraulic perform-ance of xylem. Differences between clones were deter-mined, including hydraulic conductivity and <b>conduit</b> width and <b>length</b> distributions. However, it has proved difficult to reconcile anatomical differences with physiological performance for use in future plant breeding programmes. When leaf relative water content (RWC) had been reduced from about 95 % to 85 %, the hydraulic con-ductivity of petioles decreased sharply to about 40 % of the initial value. This value corresponded with xy-lem sap tensions of 1. 8 - 2. 0 MPa. Acoustic detection experiments revealed that this reduction in hydraulic conductivity coincided with the greatest occurrence of cavitation. It seems inescapable that the reduction in hydraulic conductivity was caused by embolization; thereafter gas bubbles blocked the flow of water inside many of the conduits. There was some indication that eventually such bubbles might be dissolved, because the hydraulic conductivity increased again if speci-mens were fully rehydrated. Apparently, the incidence of cavitation coincides with the entry of gas bubbles via ultramicroscopic pores into the conduits through the walls according to the air-seeding hypothesis. When a petiolate leaf is tested in a pressure chamber it is impossible to make satisfactory measurements of a balancing pressure beyond c. 1. 8 - 2. 0 MPa, because air bubbles, mixed with sap and escaping from the conduits, form a per-sistent froth. Xylem transport in Hevea seems to be disrupted relatively easily under water stress which is a feature of other tropical species adapted to rainforest-type environments...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{influence}} of operator-dependent variables on {{the outcomes of}} lower extremity bypass (LEB) surgery have primarily been reported in single-institution, retrospective studies. We utilized data from a prospective, multicenter trial to identify technical variables that {{were significantly associated with}} early and midterm results of autogenous LEB for limb salvage. METHODS: The PREVENT III trial database includes 1404 North American patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) who underwent LEB using excised autogenous vein. The study protocol excluded claudicants and in situ reconstructions. Technical factors analyzed included vein diameter, <b>conduit</b> type, graft <b>length,</b> vein orientation, location of proximal and distal anastomoses, and performance of completion imaging. Univariate analysis was used to determine the effect of these factors on 30 day and 1 -year outcomes. Multivariate Cox regression models evaluated the {{influence of}} these factors while adjusting for age, sex, race, tobacco, diabetes, dialysis-dependency, previous index limb bypass, and study drug (edifoligide) administration. The primary outcomes were primary patency (PP), primary assisted patency (PAP), and secondary patency (SP) assessed by Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that vein diameter 3 ̆c 3. 5 mm and composite graft type were significantly associated with early (30 day) graft failure. At 1 year, multivariate analysis revealed that patency rates were negatively associated with diameter 3 ̆c 3. 5 mm (PP, PAP, SP), non-great saphenous vein (GSV) type (PP, SP), and graft lengths 3 ̆e 50 cm (PP only). Limb salvage and survival at 1 year were not significantly impacted by technical variables. Employing a prespecified trial definition of high-risk conduits (diameter 3 ̆c 3 mm or nonsingle segment 3 ̆eGSV; 24...|$|R
