5|$|At that time, {{the newly}} {{restored}} Byzantine Empire, {{under the leadership}} of Michael VIII Palaiologos, sought to recover Euboea, which was the major Latin insular possession in the Aegean Sea and a base for piratical activity directed against his lands. Furthermore, along with the Principality of Achaea it presented the major obstacle to his <b>complete</b> <b>recovery</b> of Greece. Already in 1269/1270, a Byzantine fleet under Alexios Doukas Philanthropenos had attacked and captured many Latin nobles, the town of Oreos.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, the {{introduction}} of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) by British settlers in the 19th century led to significant reductions in loggerhead sea turtle populations. In one coastal section in eastern Australia during the 1970s, predation of turtle eggs destroyed up to 95% of all clutches laid. Aggressive efforts to destroy foxes in the 1980s and 1990s has reduced this impact; however, it is estimated that it will be the year 2020 before populations will experience <b>complete</b> <b>recovery</b> from such dramatic losses.|$|E

5|$|Malaria: During {{the early}} 1940s, quinine {{was the chief}} anti-malarial drug. Made from the bark of the South American cinchona tree, quinine was in short supply during the war, so {{scientists}} began searching for an alternative treatment. The test subjects allowed themselves to be bitten by malarial mosquitoes and when the fever reached its peak in three to four days, were given experimental treatments. At the University of Minnesota, twelve CPS men underwent tests to determine the recovery period for those infected with malaria. This research documented the debilitating effects {{of the disease and}} the amount of time required for a <b>complete</b> <b>recovery.</b>|$|E

5|$|Umbricht's {{death from}} {{melanoma}} helped alert {{the general public}} about the disease. Former Los Angeles Rams linebacker Jack Pardee credited Umbricht's battle with melanoma for saving his life in 1965. Pardee, a Pro Bowl linebacker, had been ignoring a mole on his armpit.

40|$|Persistent {{intestinal}} {{damage is}} associated with higher complication rates in celiac disease. We aimed to assess the potential modifiers of mucosal recovery. We screened databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Trials, and Web of Science) for papers on celiac disease. Papers discussing (1) celiac patients (2) follow-up biopsy and (3) mucosal recovery after commencement of a gluten-free diet were included. The primary outcome was to produce a comprehensive analysis of <b>complete</b> mucosal <b>recovery</b> (i. e., Marsh 0 on follow-up). We compared children's recovery ratios to those of adults. Patients following a strict gluten-free dietary regimen were included in a subgroup. Summary point estimates, 95 % confidence intervals (CIs), and 95 % predictive intervals (PIs) were calculated. Heterogeneity was tested with I 2 -statistic. The PROSPERO registration number is CRD 42016053482. The overall <b>complete</b> mucosal <b>recovery</b> ratio, calculated from 37 observational studies, was 0. 36 (CI: 0. 28 - 0. 44, PI: - 0. 12 - 0. 84; I 2 : 98. 4 %, p< 0. 01). Children showed higher <b>complete</b> mucosal <b>recovery</b> ratio than adults (p< 0. 01) : 0. 65 (CI: 0. 44 - 0. 85, PI: - 0. 10 - 1. 39; I 2 : 96. 5 %, p< 0. 01) as opposed to 0. 24 (CI: 0. 15 - 0. 33, PI: - 0. 19 - 1. 08; I 2 : 96. 3 %, p< 0. 01). In the strict dietary adherence subgroup, <b>complete</b> mucosal <b>recovery</b> ratio was 0. 47 (CI: 0. 24 - 0. 70, PI: - 0. 47 - 1. 41; I 2 : 98. 8 %, p< 0. 001). On meta-regression, diagnostic villous atrophy (Marsh 3) ratio (- 8. 97, p< 0. 01) and male ratio (+ 6. 04, p< 0. 01) {{proved to be a}} significant determinant of <b>complete</b> mucosal <b>recovery,</b> unlike duration of gluten-free diet (+ 0. 01, p = 0. 62). The correlation between <b>complete</b> mucosal <b>recovery</b> ratio and age on diagnosis is of borderline significance (- 0. 03, p = 0. 05). There is considerable heterogeneity across studies concerning <b>complete</b> mucosal <b>recovery</b> ratios achieved by a gluten-free diet in celiac disease. Several celiac patients fail to achieve <b>complete</b> mucosal <b>recovery</b> even if a strict dietary regimen is followed. Younger age on diagnosis, less severe initial histologic damage and male gender predispose for achieving mucosal recovery...|$|R

5|$|When {{properly}} treated, {{people with}} malaria can usually expect a <b>complete</b> <b>recovery.</b> However, severe malaria can progress extremely rapidly and cause death within hours or days. In {{the most severe}} cases of the disease, fatality rates can reach 20%, even with intensive care and treatment. Over the longer term, developmental impairments have been documented in children who have suffered episodes of severe malaria. Chronic infection without severe disease can occur in an immune-deficiency syndrome associated with a decreased responsiveness to Salmonella bacteria and the Epstein–Barr virus.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Richard {{started to}} {{complain}} {{of pain in}} his left calf. The synthetic graft inserted in his July 1980 surgery had closed off, which meant that he needed a surgical bypass in his left leg. Richard was granted free agency by the Astros on November 7, 1983, but the Astros still had faith in him, so he was re-signed on February 17 of the following year. Just {{a little over two}} months later, he was released by the Astros, thus ending his baseball career. Despite an almost <b>complete</b> <b>recovery,</b> the risk of future complications was so great that he never pitched again. His final major league record was 107–71, with 1,493strikeouts and a 3.15ERA in 238games and 1,606innings. Nolan Ryan broke his Astros record for career strikeouts in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{the outcome}} for acute {{low back pain}} is positive. Pain and {{disability}} usually improve {{a great deal in}} the first six weeks, with <b>complete</b> <b>recovery</b> reported by 40 to 90%. In those who still have symptoms after six weeks, improvement is generally slower with only small gains up to one year. At one year, pain and disability levels are low to minimal in most people. Distress, previous low back pain, and job satisfaction are predictors of long-term outcome after an episode of acute pain. Certain psychological problems such as depression, or unhappiness due to loss of employment may prolong the episode of low back pain. Following a first episode of back pain, recurrences occur in more than half of people.|$|E

5|$|Patients with {{abortive}} polio infections recover completely. In {{those who}} develop only aseptic meningitis, the symptoms {{can be expected}} to persist for two to ten days, followed by <b>complete</b> <b>recovery.</b> In cases of spinal polio, if the affected nerve cells are completely destroyed, paralysis will be permanent; cells that are not destroyed, but lose function temporarily, may recover within four to six weeks after onset. Half the patients with spinal polio recover fully; one-quarter recover with mild disability, and the remaining quarter are left with severe disability. The degree of both acute paralysis and residual paralysis is likely to be proportional to the degree of viremia, and inversely proportional to the degree of immunity. Spinal polio is rarely fatal.|$|E
5|$|Tricholoma pardinum is one {{of several}} {{poisonous}} members of the genus Tricholoma; its large size, fleshy appearance, and pleasant smell and taste add to the risk of it being accidentally consumed. It was responsible for over 20 percent of cases of mushroom poisoning in Switzerland {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. Many cases of poisoning arise in the Jura Mountains. Eating it causes highly unpleasant gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, dizziness, vomiting, and diarrhea. These arise 15minutes to 2hours after consumption and often persist for several hours; <b>complete</b> <b>recovery</b> usually takes 4 to 6 days. Sweating and anxiety may be evident, and disturbance in liver function has been recorded. Cramping may occur in the calves. In one case, seven people and a cat suffered severe symptoms after sharing a meal that contained only two mushroom caps. The toxin, the identity of which is unknown, appears to cause a sudden inflammation of the mucous membranes lining the stomach and intestines.|$|E
5|$|The {{citizens}} left homeless by Omar {{resided in}} a tent city nicknamed Camp Omar, consisting of 200tents holding more than 1,000people. Volunteers and military efforts cleaned most of the debris on the island within a few weeks. Many important roads were reopened by {{three days after the}} storm. The power took four weeks to be restored island-wide, disrupting schools and businesses, although water access was expected to be restored within a few days of the storm. Schools reopened on September 14, and most businesses resumed their work {{by the end of the}} month. The United States military ceased relief operations on September 19, though <b>complete</b> <b>recovery</b> was disrupted by the passage of several subsequent typhoons. These storms caused less damage than normal after Omar wrecked the more vulnerable structures. As a result, it became difficult to discern the damage between Omar and Typhoon Gay in December 1992. A 1993 study in the medical journal Anxiety found that 7.2% of 320 participants affected by Omar developed acute stress reaction, and another 15% developed early traumatic stress response, especially those affected by the later typhoons. About 5.9% of the participants displayed symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, similar to the levels shown after Hurricane Hugo in 1989.|$|E
