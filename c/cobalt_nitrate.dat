40|$|The general {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to investigate {{the effect of the}} support and the gas atmosphere on the decomposition and reduction of <b>cobalt</b> <b>nitrate</b> hexahydrate supported on silica and alumina to gain a greater understanding of the calcination and reduction procedures used in catalyst manufacturing processes. The decomposition was followed by TGA-DSC-MS. The observed breakdown on the unsupported complex is similar but not identical to previous reports with NO detected as an evolved gas. In an oxygen/argon atmosphere the decomposition is generally simplified for the supported samples with a fewer number of weight loss events. When supported on alumina, <b>cobalt</b> <b>nitrate</b> is stabilised with decomposition events shifting to higher temperatures, whereas when supported on silica, <b>cobalt</b> <b>nitrate</b> is destabilised with only one significant decomposition event, which occurs at a lower temperature than that of the unsupported complex. In a hydrogen/nitrogen atmosphere partial decomposition of <b>cobalt</b> <b>nitrate</b> occurs before reduction is initiated with both supported samples. When supported on alumina, <b>cobalt</b> <b>nitrate</b> reduction is catalysed with the two events that occur below 350 °C happening at lower temperatures, while reduction above 350 °C is moved to higher temperatures. The silica-supported complex in contrast exhibits reduction events that are all reduced in temperature relative to the unsupported salt. However, there is evidence of the formation of cobalt silicate with a high temperature reduction. The study has shown that the calcination and direct reduction of supported <b>cobalt</b> <b>nitrate</b> is significantly affected by the support and that different conditions are required to achieve the same state...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{genesis of}} cobalt metal {{particles}} in silica-supported Fischer-Tropsch catalysts was studied using in situ Foner vibrating-sample magnetic method. The cobalt promoted and unpromoted catalysts were prepared by aqueous (co) -impregnation using <b>cobalt</b> <b>nitrate</b> or acetate, ruthenium nitrosyl nitrate or perrhenic acid followed by oxidative pre-treatment in air and reduction in hydrogen. In several catalyst preparations, sucrose {{was added to}} the impregnating solutions. The genesis of cobalt metal phases in these catalysts was monitored in situ by the magnetic method during the temperature-programmed reduction in pure hydrogen. A considerably higher extent of cobalt reduction was found in the catalysts prepared from <b>cobalt</b> <b>nitrate</b> than in those prepared from cobalt acetate. Promotion with ruthenium and rhenium results in a considerable decrease in the temperature of the emergence of cobalt metal phases. Small superparamagnetic, single-domain and multi-domain ferromagnetic cobalt metal particles were observed in the reduced catalysts by the magnetic method. It was found that lower temperature calcination of the cobalt catalysts prepared from <b>cobalt</b> <b>nitrate</b> and addition of sucrose to the impregnating solution lead to a decrease in the concentration of multi-domain cobalt ferromagnetic metal particles and to an increase in the fraction of superparamagnetic cobalt particles.

40|$|Two {{combined}} thermal analysis-mass spectrometry {{techniques have}} been used to ascertain the effects of various support materials on the preparation and subsequent combustion activity of supported cobalt oxide catalysts. Both techniques used small sample masses in order to minimise temperature and pressure gradients throughout the sample during reaction as the sample temperature was increased at a linear heating rate. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) techniques employed not only reveal reduction, but also distinguish it from the adsorption (or evolution) of the H 2 and the loss of absorbed water. The thermally induced decomposition of supported and unsupported <b>cobalt</b> <b>nitrate</b> hexahydrate was studied using a solid insertion probe mass spectrometer (SIP-MS) system operating under high vacuum.

The feeding gases consist in {{the products of the}} combustion diesel in a Reformtech heater. These gases contain CO, CO 2, H 2 O as well as small amounts of NOx and hydrocarbons. Two different catalysts were prepared for CO oxidation, based on cobalt oxide supported on ceria. 12 Co/CeO 2 with 12 % weight of cobalt and 15 CoOx/CeO 2 with 15 %. The first one was prepared by impregnation of <b>cobalt</b> <b>nitrates</b> in cerium oxide support; the second one was prepared by co-precipitation of <b>cobalt</b> and cerium <b>nitrates.</b> Another catalyst called 12 Co 4. 5 K/CeO 2, with 12 % cobalt and 4. 5 % potassium, was made for the simultaneous combustion of soot and oxidation of CO. The base also consisted in cobalt oxide supported on ceria, but with the addition of potassium which could stabilize the cobalt oxide particles. Both co-precipitation and impregnation methods gave the desired catalyst structure in the CO oxidation catalysts and both catalysts (12 Co/CeO 2 and 15 CoOx/CeO 2) showed activity. Nevertheless, the activity was lower than desired due to low surface area and mass transfer limitations. The catalysts also deactivated in less than three hours on stream, probably due to poisoning. The co-precipitation method for the 12 Co 4. 5 K/CeO 2 catalyst gave the desired cobalt and cerium oxides, but no conclusion can be drawn regarding potassium since it was not shown in the XRD tests. The catalyst for both CO oxidation and soot combustion (12 Co 4. 5 K/CeO 2) showed no activity for any of the reactions. Nevertheless, the tests performed to test the soot combustion ability were not conclusive and should be improved in future studies...|$|R

The specific capacitance of the composite increases significantly with a decrease in Ni/Co molar ratio when cobalt content is below 50 % (in molar ratio) and then decreases rapidly when cobalt content is in the range between 50 and 100 %. A maximum value of the specific capacitance (569 F/g) was obtained at Ni/Co molar ratio = 1 : 1. Also, the specific capacitance of the nickel–cobalt oxides/CNT (Ni/Co = 1 : 1) electrode is much larger than the simple sum of the specific capacitances of the nickel oxide/CNT and cobalt oxide/CNT electrodes. Su et al. [105] reported a self-hybrid composite electrode composing of MWCNT and Co–Al-layered double hydroxides. The CV curves approached rectangle shapes, and the charge and discharge curves were basically symmetrical. Compared to MWCNTs supercapacitor, this new supercapacitor has good long-term stability, larger maximum power (6, 400 W/kg) and energy density (13.2 Wh/kg), and a higher specific capacitance of 15.2 F/g even after 1, 000 cycles at a large current of 2 A/g.|$|R

Films with controlled microstructures were obtained after annealing at 880 °C for 2 h in air. The formation of Ca 3 Co 4 O 9 + δ was confirmed by X-ray diffraction, which also showed evidence of Co 3 O 4 traces. As shown by in-situ X-ray diffraction, Ca 3 Co 4 O 9 + δ starts to form at 625 °C and decomposes at 950 °C, but the transformation is reversible. Interestingly, the initial morphology of the films was maintained after annealing at either 700 or 880 °C, with the appearance of faceted crystals forming a gypsum flower-like microstructure. AC impedance spectroscopy was carried out at intermediate temperatures (600 – 800 °C) under air on 2 batches of symmetrical cells based on ESD and screen-printed electrodes, respectively.

To optimize the catalyst activation and simulate the industrial activation, TPO–TPR cycle treatment with or without steam {{has been applied to}} the prepared catalysts under various conditions. It is shown that reduction of pure hydrogen with high flow rate leads to a sharp temperature rise in the catalyst bed, which results in the sintering of the cobalt particles. A slow temperature rise with dilute hydrogen helps stabilize the cobalt particles, and the cycle treatment of the catalyst using TPO–TPR without steam induction has little effect on the size of cobalt particles. When steam is included in the reduction stream with hydrogen the TPR–TPO cycle treatment can help increase the Co dispersion, which increases the catalyst activity and selectivity to C 5 +.|$|E

In the range of Cu:Co atomic ratios from 100 : 0 to 67 : 33 the materials consist of Co-containing malachite, Cu 2 -xCo xCO 3 (OH) 2, while for Cu:Co equal to 0 : 100 and 15 : 85 the products are CoCO 3, spherocobaltite, and Cu-containing spherocobaltite Co 0. 85 Cu 0. 15 CO 3, respectively. From both reflectance spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements the presence of only Cu 2 + and Co 2 + species has been ascertained in all materials.

40|$|The {{influence}} of phosphorus (added as phosphates) on the sulfiding rate of carbon-supported Co–Mo catalysts is studied {{by means of}} temperature-programmed sulfiding. Significant progress is made in understanding the {{influence of}} phosphates on the structure and thiophene hydrodesulfurization (HDS) activity (atmospheric pressure) of carbon-supported Co–Mo catalysts. The model compound Co 3 (PO 4) 2 · 8 H 2 O is sulfided to minor extent below 800 K. Between 800 and 1000 K, instead of further sulfiding, this compound is reduced to a mixture of CoP and Co 2 P. Phosphates have a large influence on the structure and sulfiding rate of carbon-supported oxidic cobalt and Co–Mo catalysts. Addition of phosphates to these catalysts results {{in the formation of}} 2 ̆ 2 Co–PO 42 ̆ 2 species which are, compared with other cobalt species, relatively difficult to sulfide. Between 650 and 800 K cobaltphosphate species are not sulfided but reduced to cobaltphosphides while disperse sulfided cobalt species react with P 2 O 5 and hydrogen to phosphides, water and hydrogen sulfide. These cobalt sulfide species are formed upon sulfiding of CoO, Co 3 O 4, <b>cobalt</b> <b>nitrates</b> or <b>cobalt</b> species surrounded by a small number of phosphates. The sulfiding of the Mo/C catalyst is hardly influenced by the presence of phosphates. The poisoning of the low-pressure thiophene HDS activity of carbon-supported cobalt and Co–Mo catalysts by phosphorus can be explained by either the formation of 2 ̆ 2 Co–PO 42 ̆ 2 species or CoP and Co 2 P. Which of these explanations is valid depends on the reaction time and conditions. After short reaction times at 673 K, the major part of the cobalt species is present as 2 ̆ 2 Co–PO 42 ̆ 2, whereas the amount present as phosphides increases with reaction time. The Mo/C catalysts are most likely poisoned by phosphorus due to chemisorption of elemental phosphorus (P or P 4) on sulfur anion vacancies present on the edges of the MoS 2 slabs...|$|R
