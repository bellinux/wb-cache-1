40|$|That {{the lending}} channel {{is alive and}} well for {{consumer}} lending is at first glance a <b>compelling</b> <b>notion</b> given the growth in consumer credit. However, this paper demonstrates with disaggregated monthly and quarterly consumer credit data that households are awash in liquidity. Contrary to assumptions motivating the lending channel, households are not constrained in accessing credit from any lender (or in any form) in response to a monetary shock. The findings of this paper have important implications for research on the monetary transmission mechanism beyond the lending channel and for business cycle research in general. ...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{software}} development process, reuse at the requirements level {{has become an}} increasingly more <b>compelling</b> <b>notion.</b> Following a human-centric approach, this work focuses on both requirements and design solution reuse using a design knowledge repository. In recent years, many improvements {{have been made to}} increase reuse through design knowledge repositories, but retrieval of knowledge in the context of design activities continues to be a formidable challenge. We propose a new system, called CERVi, to browse a repository through visualization by exploiting relationships between units of knowledge (in our case, claims). These relationships are key to finding the most appropriate reusable knowledge based on design conditions. Testing shows that CERVi enhances the design knowledge selection process and helps users proceed through structured design decision making. Our approach will be most useful to those interested in unlocking the potential of design knowledge reuse...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{has three}} aims. First: making a general case for {{why and how}} we ought to limit the {{reliance}} on intuitions in ethical theory. Second: addressing this general question {{through the lens of}} the more specific debate surrounding the justifiability of utilitarian intuition-deployment practices. Third: contributing to greater terminological precision in the general vocabulary around intuitions. The thesis pursues the first aim through an examination of historical cases in which an excessive trust in moral intuitions led people astray, arguing for viewing our more-abstract and highly general intuitions as more trustworthy in light of being less given to the kind of “undergeneralization” often recognized as misguided in retrospect. The second aim is pursued simultaneously with the third aim, by analyzing, naming and categorizing various moral intuitions in order to point out relevant differences between those intuitions that utilitarians often distrust and the ones they nonetheless rely on. I eventually conclude that the utilitarian practice of distrusting many moral intuitions while still relying on a few, intuitively <b>compelling</b> <b>notions</b> as their grounding premises is not arbitrary or unmotivated, but rather justifiable in light of the differing methodological and epistemic characteristics displayed by the former and latter intuition-classes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{surveys and}} extends some recent {{contributions}} {{on the theory}} of exploitation as the unequal exchange of labour. A model of dynamic economies with heterogeneous optimising agents is presented which encompasses the models used in the literature as special cases. It is shown {{that the notion of}} exploitation is logically coherent and can be meaningfully analysed in such a general framework. It is then shown that the axiomatic approach of social choice theory can be adopted to explore the normative foundations of the notion of exploitation. Finally, it is argued that purely distributive approaches to exploitation are not entirely <b>compelling</b> and a <b>notion</b> of dominance, or unequal power is necessary...|$|R
40|$|Recent work in Indigenous geographies theorizes that Indigenous peoples are {{differently}} {{placed in}} relation to the state, neoliberal development, and to other Indigenous peoples, rather than a simplistic Indigenous/non-Indigenous people and custodial/exploitative frame. Indigenous people’s claims to land in Australia are overlain by a reductionist, settler legal topography that confers land rights to some Aboriginal people, native title to others, and nothing to those whose connections to land have been ‘washed away in the tide of history’. This paper presents findings from interviews and focus groups with Aboriginal Australians in settled Australia, following negotiations over resource development. We argue that in the often-distant periphery where land rights and native title are <b>compelling,</b> the <b>notion</b> of intercultural space is exotic, marketed and celebrated. In contrast, in the clearly demarcated settler zones, intercultural spaces with significant Aboriginal populations are steadfastly inscribed as dispossessed spaces, ripe for development. Because of neoliberal state–corporate alliances and interests and the ease with which the development agenda is progressed in settled Australia, we argue that realization of where, how and why these geographies have come about is needed to achieve national intercultural space. Without this understanding, only a limited intercultural space will be achieved...|$|R
40|$|A <b>compelling</b> <b>notion</b> in menu {{design is}} that {{a few of the}} most {{frequently}} selected items should be placed as a hot list {{at the top of the}} menu. A few researchers have explored this type of interface control, known as a split menu, and have investigated the identification of the hot-list items by statistical analysis of past data. We extend the technique to automated development of dynamic hot-lists for entry of medication data in a General Practice setting. Using clinical data from 113, 000 visits, a statistical model is developed and evaluated by simulated data entry of cases held back from training. Simulated SOAP note entry shows 12 -item hot lists to hold over 70 % of desired drug and diagnosis selections. Intelligent split menus should improve user efficiency if current selection methods require 3 seconds or more per item. A demonstration prototype can be downloaded over the Web...|$|E
40|$|The University of Texas at Austin {{recently}} developed two online certificate programs. Both followed a standard development process, and both {{aimed at the}} use of an instructional model based on learning objectives. They were dissimilar in that one converted an existing, traditionally taught program, while the other was a completely new development. The expectation was that the new development would have certain advantages in that it could be designed for online from the beginning, unfettered by legacy. The surprising result is that the residual "teacher" model from the existing course contributed {{to the success of the}} conversion. The most <b>compelling</b> <b>notion,</b> gained from both experiences, is that all development must share fundamental process and quality characteristics to be successful in the e-learning environment. This paper describes our development process, compares the results from development of the two programs, shares lessons learned, and outlines plans for future e-learning in the College of Engineering...|$|E
40|$|Two strings are {{distinguished}} by a program {{if the program}} always outputs one of f 0; 1; ?g, and it outputs 1 {{on one of the}} strings and 0 on the other. Two strings are k-indistinguishable if no program of length at most k can distinguish them. In this paper, we introduce the formal definitions for indistinguishability, and prove some basic properties. Indistinguishability is <b>compelling</b> <b>notion,</b> and we illustrate this by showing that our framework provides a "dual" perspective on nondeterministic communication complexity. We do this by giving a tight upper and lower bound on nondeterministic communication complexity in terms of distinguishability. Introduction How hard is it to decide an instance of a language A? This question has always {{been at the center of}} complexity theory.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 18 - 19). The logic is intuitive: as nations' interests become more global, as international trade and world economies become more complexly linked, the costs of war to nations should increase as well. Moreover, as this increasing inter-connectedness shifts the sources of conflict and of interstate power, warfare should be limited as well. Indeed, the increasing interdependence of nation-states has been discussed by scholars and observers as a potential limiting factor on interstate war. However <b>compelling,</b> this <b>notion</b> has yet to be well tested quantitatively. In addition, {{it is not clear what}} the combined effect of several individual indicators of global interdependence would have on war. The underlying concern of this research is the possibility of eliminating war by studying the relationship between war propensity and global interdependence. For the purposes of this study, two indicators of interdependence are used: annual international trade (an indicator of economic interdependence) and political alliances (to measure political interdependence). Using these two measures of the interdependence of nation-states, this study examines whether the dependence of a state's wealth on the international market and its level of political interconnectedness are associated with its likelihood to engage in interstate conflict...|$|R
40|$|This {{project has}} {{received}} {{funding from the}} European Union Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development, and demonstration under grant agreement 283871. We comment on a recent behavioral study in which we describe a human-like beckoning gesture in 2 groups of bonobos, used in combination with sexual solicitation postures. The beckoning gesture fulfils key criteria of deixis and iconicity, in that it communicates to a distant recipient the desired travel path {{in relation to a}} specific social intention, i. e., to have sex at another location. We discuss this finding {{in light of the fact}} that, despite the documented great ape capacity and obvious communicative advantage, referential gestures are still surprisingly rare in their natural communication. We address several possibilities for this peculiar underuse and are most <b>compelled</b> by the <b>notion</b> that non-human primates are generally not very motivated to share their experiences of external objects or events with others, which removes most reasons for referential signaling.

40|$|Genericity {{analysis}} {{is widely used}} to show that desirable properties that fail in certain "knife-edge" economic situations nonetheless obtain in "typical" situations. For finite-dimensional spaces of parameters, the usual notion of genericity is full Lebesgue measure. For infinite dimensional spaces of parameters (for instance, the space of preferences on a finite-dimensional commodity space, no analogue of Lebesgue measure is available; the lack of such an analogue has prompted the use of less <b>compelling</b> topological <b>notions</b> of genericity. Christensen (1974) and Hunt, Sauer and Yorke (1992) have proposed a measure-theoretic notion of genericity, which Hunt, Sauer and Yorke call prevalence, which coincides with full Lebesgue measure in Euclidean space and which extends to infinite-dimensional vector spaces. This notion is not directly applicable in most economic settings because the relevant parameter sets are small subsets of vector spaces [...] especially cones or order intervals [...] not vector spaces themselves. We adapt the notion to economically relevant environments by defining two notions of prevalence relative to a convex set in a topological vector space. The first notion {{is very easy to}} understand and apply, and has all of the properties one would desire except that it is not closed under countable unions; the second notion contains the first and has all the good properties of the first notion except simplicity; it is closed under countable unions. We provide four economic applications: 1) generic existence of equilibrium in financial models, 2) generic finiteness of the number of pure strategy Nash equilibria and Pareto inefficiency of "non-vertex" Nash equilibria for games with a continuum of actions and smooth payoffs, 3) generic regularity of exchange economies when some agents are constrained to have 0 endowment of some goods, 4) generic single-valuedness of the core of transferable utility games. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{argument}} {{of this paper}} is that social democracy has to be re-civilised if it is once again to become a serious force for change in British society. The civic domain characterised by norms of trust, community, reciprocity and solidarity ought to be returned to the core of social democratic thought. Political analysis on the centre-left has not yet {{come to terms with the}} twin crisis of market and state which is at the core of the contemporary dilemmas of British politics. Moreover, most debate is still framed around the idea of an intractable dichotomy between market and state, without acknowledging that the most profound ideological weakness on right and left is to be too heavy-handed in using the state, and too light-touch in regulating markets. In the context of the 2008 - 9 global financial crisis, the left across the industrialised world sensed an opportunity to unleash the power of the state in order to contain neo-liberal market forces: in particular, taming and regulating market institutions, from banks to sovereign wealth funds, in the public interest. Free-market Conservatives, on the other hand, have sought to use the coming period of fiscal retrenchment to shrink the state, making the state in Britain qualitatively smaller in scope and scale. Yet the crisis facing Britain is principally a crisis of society, not primarily a crisis of market or state. Ironically, both right and left have presided over the creation of a market state since the late 1970 s, in which competition in the private sector based on free markets has co-existed alongside a largely authoritarian and dirigiste centralising state. This is captured by Andrew Gamble’s <b>compelling</b> <b>notion</b> of the ‘free economy and the strong state’, in which the conditions for economic recovery are restored by liberating markets, while at the same time the authority of the centralized state is strengthened (Gamble, 1988) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{summer of}} 2008 {{signaled}} {{the inauguration of}} DukeEngage, the highly anticipated civic engagement program for undergraduates at Duke University. DukeEngage provides funding for undergraduates who wish to pursue an intensive civic engagement project for 8 -weeks in the summer, and the program’s kickoff transplanted 365 enthusiastic Duke students into virtually {{every corner of the}} globe for an immersive service experience. The proliferation of programs such as DukeEngage is just one example of a wider, more recent trend that expands not only to peer academic institutions but throughout greater society. Philanthropies, public policy institutions, humanitarian groups, non-profit organizations, politicians, teachers, even businessmen and idealists alike have adopted the mantra of “doing good”, and have reorganized their mission and vision statements accordingly – perhaps without much consideration of the idea’s complex teology and ultimate consequences. The idea of “Saving the World” is a loaded concept that cannot be separated from the complicated and profound ways in which it has been co-opted, transformed, and redefined for each new generation. In this project I hope to explore the complex ways in which Duke students - as Millennial participants in DukeEngage - imagine and live out their beliefs in the value civic engagement and buy into the <b>compelling</b> <b>notion</b> of “Saving the World”. Why is civic engagement viewed as an agent of change? From where do the assumptions of intervention as “good” emerge? What motivates these Millennial do-gooders? Ultimately, I hope to better understand how participation in DukeEngage, as well as the program itself, is a generationally specific moment that presents its fair share of problems and contradictions – as well as new possibilities. It is my hope that a better understanding of this moment will translate into the “bigger picture” – how will Millennials envision their role in greater society, and what is their relation to ideas of democracy? What will this mean {{for the future of the}} United States? Will the world with DukeEngage be a better world than one without...|$|E
40|$|In ‘From {{converts}} to itinerants: Religious butinage as dynamic identity’, Yonatan N. Gez, Yvan Droz, Edio Soares and Jeanne Rey (2016) argue that, {{in order for}} scholars to adapt to theories of religion that recognize its complex, situated and fluid aspects, {{it is crucial that}} they have better concepts for describing religion in these terms. This practical approach is <b>compelling,</b> and the <b>notion</b> of butinage that they offer is intriguing – and promising. Most associated with the activity of bees as they move from flower to flower, foraging for nectar, gathering and delivering pollen as they go Gez. et al. 2016), the notion of butinage achieves what has eluded many other scholars working with relational social theories: where others have fallen back on synchronic metaphors and/or analytic modes – ‘snapshots’, ‘assemblages’, etc. – butinage is a metaphor that powerfully evokes a sense of networks of relations existing across time. For the purposes of analysis, the notion helps us work with religiosity not through moments, but through careers. And it does so in a way that captures, most vividly, the physicality and spatiality of the actor – the butineur – in their relation with culture (‘nectar’) ...|$|R
40|$|I-j is a cell surface {{molecule}} having unique genetic polymorphism linked to the murine MHC (1, 2).

Although these <b>notions</b> <b>compelled</b> us to conclude that I-j is a genetic marker controlled by a locus mapped within the I region of MHC, recent molecular analyses of MHC have excluded the presence of the I-j structural gene within the MHC chromosomal segment (11 - 14). Because I-j had solely been defined by the specificity of alloantibodies, we reexamined the effect of anti-IJ mAb on T cell functions to find that anti- 1 -j' mAb block syngeneic and allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) of H- 2 k by reacting with the responder but not with stimulator cells (15).

40|$|This {{study is}} {{predicated}} upon {{an analysis of}} the manifesto as a rhetorical centerpiece of both black resistance and revolution from slavery to the present in an attempt to build on an obviously significant, yet undertheorized, genre of persuasion. It examines the history of black manifestos and moves to study the utility ands strategies of prison autobiographies and life-writings in the Black Power movement to understand the typology of discourses produced under constant surveillance and violence from the state. To this end, the study examines the life writings or, manifestos, of three Black Power activists: Assata Shakur, Mumia Abu-Jamal and H. Rap Brown (now Jamil Al-Amin). Rather than studying all of their rhetorical actions during the earliest phase of the Black Power movement of the mid- to late 1960 s, this study instead features the regenerative strategies within the prison manifestos of Black Power leaders who have been <b>compelled</b> to revise <b>notions</b> of Black Power after many of its leaders and followers were either jailed or killed for their revolutionary actions and commitments during the 1960 s. These chapters examine the rhetorical strategies within the autobiographical manifestos that continue Black Power agitation and trace how the writers continue to serve as celebrities and Black Power leaders in a new phase of Black Power agitation. Finally, the study looks at the potentially positive and negative contributions of regenerative Black Power strategies in the autobiographical manifestos of Shakur, Abu-Jamal, and Brown, and traces the circulation of their ideologies through hip-hop culture to see how these activists continue to inform the black public sphere of incarceration...|$|R
