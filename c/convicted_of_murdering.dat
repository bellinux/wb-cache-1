5|$|Cleveland's {{service as}} sheriff was unremarkable; biographer Rexford Tugwell {{described}} {{the time in}} office as a waste for Cleveland politically. Cleveland was aware of graft in the sheriff's office during his tenure and chose not to confront it. A notable incident of his term took place on September 6, 1872, when Patrick Morrissey was executed, who had been <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>murdering</b> his mother. As sheriff, Cleveland was responsible for either personally carrying out the execution or paying a deputy $10 to perform the task. In spite of reservations about the hanging, Cleveland executed Morrissey himself; he hanged another murderer, John Gaffney, on February 14, 1873.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s {{the hotel}} was {{beginning}} to lose it reputation and a slow decline in popularity began which would culminate in tragedy for Tony Pike. In 1998, Pike had put the hotel up for sale. A deal was {{set up for the}} sale {{which turned out to be}} a scam and Pike was swindled out of £50,000. His son, Anthony Dale Pike, flew to Miami to resolve the situation for his father. However, he was killed the same day of his arrival on 15 February 1998, shot twice in the head and dumped in a secluded forest at Virginia Key beach. Miami Dade Police detectives believed it was clear that he was killed by the people plotting to seize control of the hotel. The police arrested and questioned German tennis professional Thomas Heinz Knott over the murder, but the investigation led them to charge Italian TV producer Enrico Forti with fraud over the transfer of £50,000 from Anthony’s father. In June 2000, Forti was also <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>murdering</b> Anthony Dale Pike in Miami. Forti is now serving a lifetime prison sentence at the Everglades Correctional Institution in Florida.|$|E
5|$|Confident {{that the}} results of the 1795 {{election}} would be reversed, Benjamin Logan was the first to declare his candidacy for the governorship in 1799. Garrard and Thomas Todd declared their respective candidacies soon after. Former U.S. Representative Christopher Greenup also sought the office. Many of the recent settlers in Kentucky were unaware of his illustrious military record and unimpressed with his unsophisticated speaking skills. Although the candidates themselves rarely spoke negatively of each other, opponents of each candidate independently raised issues that they felt would hurt that candidate. John Breckinridge, Garrard's long-time political nemesis, tried to goad Garrard into making another impassioned plea for emancipation of slaves, which was a minority position in the state, but Garrard recognized Breckinridge's tactics and refused to express any bold emancipationist sentiments during the campaign. The fact that the slavery protections in the new constitution were even stronger than those in the previous document ensured that the incumbent's previous anti-slavery sentiments were not a major concern to most of the electorate. The family of Henry Field, a prominent leader in Frankfort, attacked Garrard for not issuing a pardon for Field, who was <b>convicted</b> <b>of</b> <b>murdering</b> his wife with an ax. After examining the evidence in the case, Garrard concluded that the verdict was reached justly and without undue outside influence, but the charge was raised so late in the campaign that Garrard's defense of his refusal to issue a pardon could not be circulated widely.|$|E
