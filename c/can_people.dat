25|$|Saved {{proved to}} be a major {{breakthrough}} for Oldman. Max Stafford-Clark, artistic director of the Royal Court Theatre, had seen Oldman's performance and cast him as Scopey, the lead role of Bond's The Pope's Wedding, in 1984. For his acclaimed performance, he won two of British theatre's top honours: the Time Out Fringe Award for Best Newcomer, and the Drama Theatre Award for Best Actor—the latter of which was shared with future film co-star Anthony Hopkins for his performance in Pravda. Oldman's turn in The Pope's Wedding led to a run of work with the Royal Court, and from 1984 to 1986 he appeared in Rat in the Skull (Ron Hutchinson), The Desert Air (Nicholas Wright), Cain and Abel, The Danton Affair (Pam Gems), Women Beware Women (Thomas Middleton), Real Dreams (Trevor Griffiths) and all three of Bond's The War Plays: Red Black and Ignorant, The Tin <b>Can</b> <b>People</b> and Great Peace. Oldman {{was a member of the}} Royal Shakespeare Company from 1985 to 1986.|$|E

Gay Mitchell challenged Martin McGuinness on the [...] "fairytale" [...] that he {{left the}} IRA in 1974, asking him directly: [...] "If you (McGuinness) say you left the IRA in 1974 and persist in saying that when you didn’t; {{if you say you}} are living on the average industrial wage when you are drawing down a couple of hundred grand– how <b>can</b> <b>people</b> have confidence in your word?" [...] Moderator Vincent Browne later challenged Martin McGuinness' claims {{that he left}} the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1974, producing eight books with alleged evidence claiming otherwise. McGuinness referenced this moment when he said in a later debate on the radio that people would blame him for the 1916 Rising if they {{could find a way to}} implicate him.|$|E

500|$|Warner Bros. {{president}} of production Jeff Robinov had hoped a third film {{would be released}} in 2011 or 2012. Nolan wanted the story for the third installment to keep him emotionally invested. [...] "On a more superficial level, I {{have to ask the}} question," [...] he reasoned, [...] "how many good third movies in a franchise <b>can</b> <b>people</b> name?" [...] Nolan said that he never even thought a third film was possible in the foreword for his book The Art and Making of the Dark Knight Trilogy. Nolan only agreed to a third film on the basis of finding a worthwhile story, fearing that he would become bored halfway through production if he discovered the film to be unnecessary. By December 2008, Nolan completed a rough story outline, before he committed himself to Inception. Later in December, Alan F. Horn confirmed that while discussions with Nolan about a third film were ongoing, no casting had been done, and Horn denied all such rumors. Before Nolan confirmed his involvement, Gary Oldman had said he was confident Nolan would return.|$|E
500|$|Nolan {{wanted the}} story for {{the third and final}} {{installment}} to keep him emotionally invested. [...] "On a more superficial level, I have to ask the question," [...] he reasoned, [...] "how many good third movies in a franchise <b>can</b> <b>people</b> name?" [...] He returned out of finding a necessary way to continue the story, but feared midway through filming he would find a sequel redundant. The Dark Knight Rises is intended to complete Nolan's Batman trilogy. By December 2008, Nolan completed a rough story outline, before he committed himself to Inception. In February 2010, work on the screenplay was commencing with David S. Goyer and Jonathan Nolan. When Goyer left to work on the Superman reboot, Jonathan was writing the script based on the story by his brother and Goyer. Tom Hardy was cast as Bane and Anne Hathaway plays Selina Kyle. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was cast as John Blake, and Marion Cotillard was cast as Miranda Tate. Filming began in May 2011 and concluded in November. Nolan chose not to film in 3-D but, by focusing on improving image quality and scale using the IMAX format, hoped to push technological boundaries while nevertheless making the style of the film consistent with the previous two. Nolan had several meetings with IMAX Vice-President David Keighley to work on the logistics of projecting films in digital IMAX venues. The Dark Knight Rises featured more scenes shot in IMAX than The Dark Knight. Cinematographer Wally Pfister expressed interest in shooting the film entirely in IMAX. During the film, set eight years after Dark Knight, the arrival of new foe Bane forces Bruce to return to his old role as Batman, only to find himself overpowered and captured by Bane as Gotham is cut {{off from the rest of}} the world with a stolen Wayne Enterprises fusion generator prototype set to go off in a few months. With the aid of thief Selina Kyle, Bruce is able to return to Gotham and defeat Bane while redeeming his image as Batman. The film concludes with Bruce having 'retired' as Batman after faking his death to live with Selina Kyle, evidence suggesting that he has passed on the Batcave to new ally Detective John Blake (real first name Robin) while Gotham rebuilds in memory of the Dark Knight's heroism.|$|E

2500|$|Judaism has {{traditionally}} taught that God is omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent. Yet, these claims are in jarring {{contrast with the}} fact that there is much evil in the world. Perhaps the most difficult question that monotheists have confronted is [...] "how can one reconcile the existence of this view of God with the existence of evil?" [...] or [...] "how can there be good without bad?" [...] "how can there be a God without a devil?" [...] This is the problem of evil. [...] Within all monotheistic faiths many answers (theodicies) have been proposed. [...] However, in light of the magnitude of evil seen in the Holocaust, many people have re-examined classical views on this subject. How <b>can</b> <b>people</b> still have any kind of faith after the Holocaust? [...] This set of Jewish philosophies is discussed in the article on Holocaust theology.|$|E

The Wachowski Brothers basically took all the great sci-fi ideas of the 20th century and rolled them into a delicious pop culture sandwich that everyone on the planet devoured." [...] Director M. Night Shyamalan expressed admiration for The Wachowskis, stating, [...] "Whatever you think of The Matrix, every shot is there because of the passion they have! You can see they argued it out!". Actor and screenwriter Simon Pegg said that The Matrix provided [...] "the excitement and satisfaction that [...] failed to inspire. The Matrix seemed fresh and cool and visually breathtaking; making wonderful, intelligent use of CGI to augment the on-screen action, striking a perfect balance of the real and the hyperreal. It was possibly the coolest film I had ever seen." [...] Director Quentin Tarantino counted The Matrix as one of his twenty favourite movies from 1992 to 2009.|$|E
