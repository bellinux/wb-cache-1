40|$|This study {{considers}} how {{the probability}} of exceeding central counterparty (CCP) initial margin levels can be estimated, {{in order to provide}} a timely and informative measure of risk coverage. Previous studies of CCP margining have largely focused on the unconditional distribution of returns, estimating margin coverage on a long-term average basis. The present study extends previous work by estimating conditional margin coverage using a GARCH (1, 1) model, so that variations in coverage can be tracked over a much shorter time frame. The model is applied to estimating non-coverage probabilities for two heavily traded derivatives contracts, the Brent and FTSE 100 futures. To account for the well-documented fat-tailed characteristics of distributions of futures returns, several variants of the GARCH model are estimated. These assume that innovations are distributed according to either normal, Student t, extreme value or historical distributions. Backtesting is used to select the best performing distribution. During the sample period, margins are found to provide a coverage level generally in excess of 99 %, over a one-day time horizon. It is noted, however, that the coverage probability implied by the model is likely to fall under more volatile market conditions; under these circumstances central counterparties will reset initial margin more frequently and <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>margin</b> intraday. ...|$|E

40|$|Intraday margin is a {{generally}} accepted risk management tool of central counterparties to cover increased risk exposure during the day. Central counterparties may <b>call</b> <b>for</b> intraday <b>margin</b> {{on a routine}} basis, but also in case of extreme price volatility or large changes in positions of clearing members. An increase {{in the use of}} a routine intraday margin call can be seen at central counterparties in the EU. Three central counterparties have recently introduced a routine intraday margin call and two central counterparties intend to do so. This article explores the concept of intraday margin and its role within the risk management framework of the central counterparty. In addition, an overview is given of the benefits, cost and side effects of intraday margining to the central counterparty, its clearing members and the capital market in general. Finally, the article examines the practice of intraday margining of central counterparties in the EU and the differences in intraday margining policies.

40|$|The {{surgical}} {{management of}} malignant melanoma historically <b>called</b> <b>for</b> wide excision {{of skin and}} subcutaneous tissue for any given lesion, but has evolved to be rationally-based on pathological staging. Breslow and Clark independently described level and thickness as determinant in prognosis and margin of excision. The American Joint Committee of Cancer (AJCC) in 1988 combined features from each of these histologic classifications, generating a new system, which is continuously updated and improved. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has also combined several large randomized prospective trials to generate current guidelines for melanoma excision as well. In this article, we reviewed: (1) Breslow and Clark classifications, AJCC and NCCN guidelines, the World Health Organization’s 1988 study, and the Intergroup Melanoma Surgical Trial; (2) Experimental use of Mohs surgery for in situ melanoma; and (3) Surgical margins and utility and indications for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and lymphadenectomy.

50|$|Next, one determines if the {{surgical}} margin is clear. With serial sectioning, {{one has to}} recreate {{the surgical}} specimen in a 3-dimensional way. The first section that touches the blade begins the 3-dimensional reconstruction.

40|$|This paper {{argues for}} a {{coalition}} of ‘embattled adversaries’, namely philosophy and literature and it does that by referring to Derrida`s seminal work, Margins of Philosophy. To deepen our thesis about the alliance of philosophy and literature, we also allude to Indian philosophy and the great Indian philosophico-literary epic, the Mahabharata. Foundational Indian philosophic texts such as the Vedas and the Upanishads were articulated through poetic hymns which exude rich literary inflexions. This literary inscape of Indian philosophical texts testifies the close kinship or non-duality of philosophy and literature. The Mahabharata is both philosophy as literature as well as philosophy and literature simultaneously. We would establish this claim by foregrounding the philosophical theme of cosmography or cosmological time/ deep time/kala or what we call thick time as enunciated in the Mahabharata [...] Derrida used the term ‘tympanum’ to signify the divisive borderlines that constitutes epistemic and disciplinary boundaries. Derrida <b>called</b> <b>for</b> de-tympanising all <b>margins</b> that distances philosophy from its alienated Other such as literature.

30|$|US farm {{programs}} have been moving towards using insurance to provide the farm safety net for many years but this policy transformation {{has not been realized}} for dairy farms. Historically, support for dairy farmers focused on milk price but has been declining in real terms for decades. Dairy policy in the US has been in flux because of the recent increases in feed price levels and increases in export markets that have made historic milk price supports essentially irrelevant. Recently a program of subsidized insurance <b>for</b> the <b>margin</b> between milk and feed price has met with limited success. We analyze the potential demand <b>for</b> <b>margin</b> insurance using estimates from a survey of US dairy farmers. Dairy farmers with larger herds and more education were willing to pay more for the insurance. In addition, those dairy farm operators who had used milk and feed price risk instruments in the past were willing to pay more <b>for</b> <b>margin</b> insurance than those who had not. However, the willingness-to-pay for these contracts by farmers who had not used risk management tools was low, calling into question the feasibility of using margin insurance as the foundation of policies intended to support all dairy farms.|$|R
