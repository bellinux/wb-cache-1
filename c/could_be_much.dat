5|$|Theodore Robert Bundy (born Theodore Robert Cowell; November 24, 1946– January 24, 1989) was an American serial killer, kidnapper, rapist, burglar and necrophile who {{assaulted}} {{and murdered}} numerous {{young women and}} girls during the 1970s, and possibly earlier. Shortly before his execution—after {{more than a decade}} of denials—he confessed to 30 homicides committed in seven states between 1974 and 1978. The true victim count remains unknown, and <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> higher.|$|E
5|$|In {{the northwestern}} and northeastern {{parts of the}} shield volcano, basanite lava flows were erupted and are volumetrically subordinate. These {{represent}} the youngest known lavas of the Itcha Range. However, a cinder cone {{in the middle of}} the shield <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> younger, perhaps as young as the basanites at Nazko Cone to the east, which were erupted 340,000to 7,100years ago. The older basanites in the Itcha Range may have been erupted contemporaneously with the late feldspar hawaiites.|$|E
5|$|All {{nihonium}} isotopes {{are extremely}} unstable and radioactive; however, the heavier nihonium isotopes are {{more stable than}} the lighter. The most stable known nihonium isotope, 286Nh, is also the heaviest confirmed nihonium isotope; it has a half-life of 8seconds. The isotope 285Nh and the unconfirmed 290Nh {{have been reported to}} also have half-lives of over a second. The isotopes 284Nh and 283Nh have half-lives of 1 and 0.1seconds respectively. The remaining two isotopes have half-lives between 0.1 and 100milliseconds: 282Nh has a half-life of 70milliseconds, and 278Nh, the lightest known nihonium isotope, is also the shortest-lived known nihonium isotope, with a half-life of just 1.4milliseconds. It is predicted that even heavier undiscovered nihonium isotopes <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more stable: for example, 287Nh is predicted to have a half-life of around 20minutes, close to two orders of magnitude more than that of 286Nh.|$|E

However, {{there is some evidence}} the actual mortality rate of avian flu <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> lower, as there may be many people with milder symptoms who do not seek treatment and are not counted.|$|E
25|$|As of December 10, Red Cross efforts had {{resulted}} in the reuniting of 15 families in the Congo, most who had separated from children in the confusion. Four radio stations were tasked with broadcasting the information of missing children, while Red Cross members posted pictures of lost children in displaced-person centers. The registered number of lost children was at 134, {{but according to the}} organization the number <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> higher.|$|E
25|$|Rodney James Alcala (born Rodrigo Jacques Alcala Buquor; August 23, 1943) is {{a convicted}} rapist and serial killer. He {{was sentenced to}} death in California in 2010 for five murders {{committed}} in that state between 1977 and 1979. In 2013, he received an additional sentence of 25 years to life after pleading guilty to two homicides committed in New York in 1971 and 1977. His true victim count remains unknown, and <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> higher.|$|E

25|$|The {{precursor}} of the 1969 race riots {{can be traced}} to the 13 May Incident in Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya in Malaysia. It was triggered by the results of the General Election, which were marked by Sino-Malay riots unprecedented in Malaysian history — 196 people were killed and over 350 injured between 13 May and 31 July. The real figures <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> higher than officially revealed. The Malaysian government declared a state of emergency and suspended Parliament until 1971.|$|E
25|$|As of May 2009, {{there were}} at least 137 known {{juvenile}} offenders awaiting execution in Iran, but the total number <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> higher as many death penalty cases in Iran are believed to go unreported. Of the 43 child offenders recorded as having been executed since 1990, 11 were still under the age of 18 {{at the time of their}} execution while the others were either kept on death row until they had reached 18 or were convicted and sentenced after reaching that age. Including at least one 13-year-old and 14-year-old.|$|E
25|$|Without {{commenting on}} the {{morality}} of the bill, the Canadian Network Operators Consortium noted that smaller, independent ISPs would likely be unable to afford expensive new equipment to allow authorities real-time monitoring of their customers and may have to discontinue business. The Ministry had estimated that the initial cost of the bill to be $80 Million over four years, and $6.7 Million dollars each year after that. The ISPs claimed the cost <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> higher. According to the CBC, the costs would have either translated as higher telecommunications costs for Canadian consumers, or increased federal {{taxes to pay for}} the program.|$|E

25|$|The ZBD patents {{included}} two other major interrelated innovations: one concerning {{the use of}} parallel connected, instead of series connected, utilization loads, the other concerning the ability to have high turns ratio transformers such that the supply network voltage <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> higher (initially 1400V to 2000V) than the voltage of utilization loads (100V initially preferred). When employed in parallel connected electric distribution systems, closed-core transformers finally made it technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes, businesses and public spaces. The other essential milestone was the introduction of 'voltage source, voltage intensive' (VSVI) systems' by the invention of constant voltage generators in 1885. Ottó Bláthy also invented the first AC electricity meter.|$|E
25|$|One {{of the few}} {{commercial}} {{developers to}} join the contest was Dave Raggett at Hewlett-Packard in Bristol, England. He created a browser called Arena. HP had a convention that an employee could engage in related, useful, but not official work for 10 percent {{of his or her}} job time. Dave spent his 10 percent time, plus a lot of evenings and weekends, on Arena. He was convinced that hypertext Web pages <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more exciting, like magazine pages rather than textbook pages, and that HTML could be used to position not just text on a page but pictures, tables, and other features. He used Arena to demonstrate all these things, and to experiment with different ways of reading and interpreting both valid and incorrectly written HTML pages.|$|E
25|$|Cellars {{have always}} been much more {{important}} in Continental Europe than in the United Kingdom, and especially in Germany almost all houses and apartment blocks have been and still are built with cellars. For this reason, air-raid precautions during World War II in Germany <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more readily implemented by the authorities than was possible in the UK. All that was necessary was to ascertain that cellars were being prepared to accommodate all the residents of a building; that all the cellar hatch and window protections were in place; that access to the cellars was safe {{in the event of}} an air raid; that once inside, the occupants were secure for any incidents other than direct hits during the air raid; and that means of escape in case of a real emergency were easily available.|$|E

25|$|Jastrow {{was born}} in Rogasen in the Grand Duchy of Posen. After {{receiving}} rabbinical ordination, Ph.D., and Doctorate of Letters (D.Litt), he became the rabbi of the then Orthodox Congregation Rodeph Shalom in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1866, {{at the age of}} thirty-seven. In 1886, he began publishing his magnum opus, A Dictionary of the Targumim, Talmud Babli, Talmud Yerushalmi and Midrashic Literature, in pamphlet form. It was finally completed and published in two-volume form in 1903, and has since become a popular resource for students of Talmud. In the preface to this work, Jastrow sharply criticized those linguistic and etymological scholars who claimed that obscure terms in Talmudic literature are primarily derived from Greek. Jastrow held that Greek influence on Talmudic Aramaic was minimal, and that most obscure terms <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more simply traced to Hebrew origins. Jastrow was also responsible for most Talmud-related articles in the Jewish Encyclopedia.|$|E
25|$|Zamenhof {{would later}} {{say that he}} had dreamed of a world {{language}} since he was a child. At first he considered a revival of Latin, but after learning it in school he decided it was too complicated to be a common means of international communication. When he learned English, he realised that verb conjugations were unnecessary, and that grammatical systems <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> simpler than he had expected. He still had the problem of memorising a large vocabulary, until he noticed two Russian signs labelled Швейцарская (švejtsarskaja, a porter's lodge – from швейцар švejtsar, a porter) and Кондитерская (konditerskaja, a confectioner's shop – from кондитер konditer, a confectioner). He then realised that a judicious use of affixes could greatly decrease the number of root words needed for communication. He chose to take his vocabulary from Romance and Germanic, the languages that were most widely taught in schools around the world and would therefore be recognisable to the largest number of people.|$|E
25|$|Construction of the {{underground}} facility began in late 1941, and was completed by late summer 1942. The chambers served as a dual observation post, with an observation slit overlooking the Bay of Gibraltar and a larger aperture over the Mediterranean Sea. Six men were selected for the operation, an executive officer as leader, two physicians, and three wireless operators. All six men had volunteered to be sealed inside the cave should Gibraltar fall to the Axis powers. The men understood that they would remain sealed within the facility for about a year, although it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> longer. Provisions for a seven-year stay had been assembled in the complex. However, the plan was never activated. The Director of Naval Intelligence ordered that the provisions in the complex be distributed and the cave sealed. Rumours of a secret complex, eventually dubbed Stay Behind Cave, circulated for decades in Gibraltar, until discovery of the chambers in 1997 by the Gibraltar Caving Group. The authenticity of the site was confirmed {{by one of the}} builders in 1998, and a decade later by one of the physicians. That physician, the last surviving member of the Tracer team, died in 2010.|$|E
