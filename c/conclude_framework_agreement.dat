The main purpose of this master thesis is to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the provisions of <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> in the field of public procurement. The master thesis is based on the current provision of the Act No. 137 / 2006 Coll., on Public Procurements and is divided into five chapters. Chapter one deals with the adaptation of <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> in the legislation both in the Czech Republic and in the European Union and as well with the development of this legislation. Chapter two focuses on the basic principles and concepts of the Act No. 137 / 2006 Coll., on Public Procurements which are relevant for the topic of this master thesis. The first part of this chapter defines the basic principles contained in the Act and the in the legislation of the European Union.

50|$|Although Sweden had {{connected}} to the internet in 1984, it was not until 1988 that this access was considered significant, when the higher education network SUNET was able to connect with the USA. Internet access became available to the Swedish public in 1994 when Algonet as the first operator connected the Swedish Internet with the Swedish telephone network via modem pools. The usage costs were made up of a fixed monthly fee and per minute charges as with any other telephone call. In 1996 Internet access became available for a flat monthly fee in Ängelholm where the local cable TV company began to offer connectivity via Cable TV modems with an Ethernet interface. A big change started in 1999 when Bredbandsbolaget <b>concluded</b> a <b>Framework</b> <b>Agreement</b> with housing movement HSB and a large number of condominium apartments were given access to the Internet. This led Telia {{to come up with a}} similar offer, and soon a market was created where Bredbandsbolaget and Telia were just two of several players.

The Court upheld a decision by ESA finding that Norway Post had abused its dominant position {{in the market for}} business-to-consumer parcel services with over-the-counter delivery in Norway by pursuing an exclusivity strategy with preferential treatment when establishing and maintaining its Postin-Shop network. The facts of the case were as follows. In 2000 and 2001, Norway Post <b>concluded</b> <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> with several undertakings with a view to establish its Post-in-Shop network. Certain agreements specifically excluded competitors in the market for business-to-consumer parcel services from access to any of the outlets in these chains, while others guaranteed Norway Post exclusivity in the outlets which hosted a Post-in-Shop. Due to these exclusivity obligations, once the main roll-out of the Post-in-Shop concept had been implemented towards the end of 2003, Norway Post’s competitors were foreclosed from approximately 50% of all outlets belonging to grocery store, kiosk and petrol station chains in Norway. Furthermore, from 2004 to 2006, Norway Post negotiated preference status questions with its partners for the period subsequent to the expiry of those agreements in 2006. While Norway Post did not actively link the negotiations on preference status with the exclusivity obligations, it did not announce to its partners that it would not maintain such clauses in future cooperation agreements. In its judgment, the Court held that the proceedings, which had led to the imposition of a substantial fine on the applicant, as a matter of principle, must respect the guarantees for criminal proceedings enshrined in Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In particular, the right to a fair trial requires that the Court must be able to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and of law, the challenged decision. Furthermore, it follows from the principle of the presumption of innocence that the undertaking to which the decision finding an infringement was addressed must be given the benefit of the doubt. As a consequence, the Court rejected ESA’s submission that its review of complex economic assessments by ESA would be limited to a “manifest error” standard. In substance, the Court upheld ESA’s assessment of Norway Post’s conduct. The Court dismissed Norway Post’s arguments that the exclusivity clauses were objectively necessary for the efficient implementation of the Post-in-Shop concept.|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] The {{abuse of}} {{fixed-term}} contracts raises various concerns. In most countries, fraud {{related to these}} contractual practices may occur when they are used for activities whose nature is not temporary or when they are renewed for longer periods or with a higher number of renewals than those permitted by law. These concerns were already present {{at the end of}} the 1990 s, when some provisions were taken at European level to address the issue. In order to improve the quality of fixed-term work and to prevent abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts (excluding apprenticeship and training schemes and temporary agency work contracts), the interprofessional European social partners’ organisations <b>concluded</b> the European <b>framework</b> <b>agreement</b> on fixed-term contracts on 18 March 1999 (ETUC et al, 1999), later transposed into Directive 1999 / 70 /EC. The directive: sets out a general principle of non-discrimination against fixed-term employees compared with permanent employees;details responsibilities on the part of the employer in terms of informing workers on fixed-term contracts about vacancies in the organisation; and sets out measures aimed at preventing abuses. In particular, the directive requires Member States to introduce one or more of the following measures: objective reasons justifying the renewal of fixed-term contracts the maximum total duration of successive fixed-term employment contracts or relationships the number of renewals of such contracts or relationships...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} nature of <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> in public {{procurement}} in Sweden. The main question is whether a contracting authority is obligated to place orders under a <b>framework</b> <b>agreement</b> when purchasing a product or service that is covered in that agreement and to what extent a contractor is obligated to accept such orders. If the answer to that first question is that an obligation does exist the next question to arise is what kind of consequences to expect when either party fails to meet that obligation. Of great importance is whether a contracting authority that hasn’t used an existing <b>framework</b> <b>agreement</b> is liable to pay damages to the contractor who according to the agreement had a right to deliver. A summary of the results is that the answers to all of the questions depend on what type of <b>framework</b> <b>agreement</b> that is used, whether it’s a contract that has one or several contractors and if all the terms for future contracts are specified. <b>Framework</b> <b>agreements</b> with only one contractor and where all the terms for future contracts have been established are very similar to normal public contracts, which means that it would make sense to use the same set of rules. In this case it’s therefore likely that both parties are obligated by the <b>framework</b> <b>agreement</b> and that failure to live up to these obligations can result in liability. A <b>framework</b> <b>agreement</b> with several contractors where all the terms are not established and where contracts are awarded only after a renewed evaluation of tenders is on the other hand quite different from a public contract. One should therefore not be surprised to find that other rules may apply. Unfortunately I have been unable to give definitive answers to most questions because the available sources are too limited. This thesis is therefore a call to the legislator to clarify and also a call for the increased understanding of, and improved statistics regarding, <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> that is necessary to improve public procurement...|$|R
