40|$|Restrictions on {{international}} capital transactions and other payments are usually designed to limit volatile short-term capital flows (“hot money”) and stabilize the exchange rate. Their imposition, however, {{may have the}} opposite effect by inadvertently signaling the continuation of macroeconomic imbalances and inconsistent (“bad”) future policy (Bartolini and Drazen, 1997 a,b). This paper investigates these alternative hypotheses by testing the impact of restrictions {{on international}} capital flows and other payments controls on the likelihood of currency crises. We employ a comprehensive sample of 90 developing and emerging-market economies over the 1975 - 1997 period, identifying 160 currency crises. Restrictions on <b>international</b> capital flows, <b>current</b> accounts, and <b>international</b> <b>payments</b> {{are associated with a}} higher probability of the onset of a speculative attack on the currency. This finding is robust to alternative measures of liberalization on <b>international</b> <b>payments</b> and the exchange rate regime, controlling for macroeconomic determinants of currency instability, and taking into account instability emanating from the banking sector. There may be some individual exceptions but the weight of the evidence suggests that countries imposing capital restrictions are sending a “bad signal” to markets, in turn increasing the likelihood of a net capital outflow and a currency crisis. ...|$|R
40|$|Concern {{about global}} {{imbalances}} {{has been building}} since the 1990 s and analysts {{from a variety of}} disciplines have called attention to aspects of the problem, ranging from the unsustainability of the U. S. current account position to the role of ‘under’ and ‘over’ saving rates in deficit and surplus countries. Many analysts assume that imbalances arise as a result of developments and policies within national economies. This paper argues that imbalances also result from interactions at the global level and are at least partially shaped by pressures generated by the <b>current</b> <b>international</b> monetary and <b>payments</b> systems on the direction and volume of international capital flows. This paper discusses the ways in which a fiat currency and privatized <b>international</b> <b>payments</b> system under the guardianship of a few wealthy developed countries and their private multinational financial institutions have contributed to the problem. � It examines the U. S. international investment position, noting the links between changes in net capital flows and credit expansion and between foreign exchange reserves held in the U. S. and liquidity creation. It discusses the risks in failing to address the U. S. foreign debt problem and offers proposals needed to address the monetary aspects of global imbalances. U.

40|$|<b>International</b> <b>Payments</b> Law Reform: Introduction of Global Code of Payments Resumé As of November 2009, {{the member}} states of the European Union are to have {{implemented}} the EU Payment Services Directive ("PSD"), a noteworthy instrument of EU payments law. At the same time, but in the {{different part of the}} world, discussions about harmonization and unification of payments law arise. The PSD focuses solely on the transactions within the European Union, whilst, by way of comparison, discussions in the U. S. focus solely on domestic payments law harmonization. Thus, with both the EU and U. S. focusing primarily on internal issues, debate on global payments law reform is markedly absent. This Master's degree thesis aimed to fill such absence by the following means. Firstly, in Chapter 2, the author provided a general overview of <b>current</b> terminology of <b>international</b> <b>payments</b> law. Furthermore, a limited outline of current legislation (i. e. Uniform Commercial Code Article 4 A - Funds Transfers ("Article 4 A"), UNCITRAL Model Law on International Credit Transfers ("Model Law") and the PSD was provided. Chapter 2 contains a useful comparison of credit and debit transactions. Moreover, in Chapter 2 the author offered a limited evaluation and analysis of the drafting processes of the Article 4 A, the Model Law and the PSD [...] . ...|$|R

Unfortunately, we are unsure if this problem can be rectified. Apologies for the inconvenience. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER) database tracks exchange and trade arrangements for all IMF member countries. This unique database is updated yearly based mostly on information from country authorities. The database also provides information on different types of capital controls used by countries, restrictions on <b>current</b> <b>international</b> <b>payments</b> and transfers, arrangements for payments and receipts, procedures for resident and non-resident accounts, exchange rate arrangements, and the operation of foreign exchange markets. It also includes measures implemented in the financial sector, including prudential measures. The IMF has published the AREAER annually since 1950. AREAER Online, accessible at the UK Data Service provides {{direct access to the}} data used to create the yearly reports covering the period from 1999 through 2010. The data can be searched across years, countries and specific categories. This database was first provided by the UK Data Service in December 2013 and includes the IMF AREAER dataset user guide.

40|$|This paper shows why all {{analyses}} proposed {{to explain and}} predict exchange rate fluctuations have not fulfilled their ambitious aim and it investigates how the problem should be tackled {{in order to develop}} a solution that guarantees an intrinsic exchange rate stability. In the first two sections it is proved that, contrary to what is often believed, exchange rate fluctuations are caused by neither commercial nor financial transactions. The third and fourth sections are concerned with the hypothetical influence of national monetary disorders (inflation and deflation) and of interest rates on exchange rates, while the fifth deals with speculation and the sixth with the relationship between exchange rates and external debt servicing. The need to move from a system of relative exchange rates to one of absolute exchange rates is dealt with in the last section, where it is shown also that the anomaly of the <b>current</b> system of <b>international</b> <b>payments</b> {{lies in the fact that}} currencies are transformed from means into objects of payment...|$|R
