A lack of substitutability between cans and glass containers may explain the increased market share for cans.

40|$|In this paper, {{we attempt}} to specify the {{influencer}} and the influential terms in <b>consumer</b> <b>package</b> goods by using the influence diffusion model (IDM). IDM calculates the spread of a term in the blogosphere recursively, and evaluates the influence of terms, blog entries, and bloggers. The model {{was applied to the}} official data from a blog hosting service. The results of the model were compared with the term frequency (TF). Then, the influencers of the IDM were examined and compared with the results of other network indices such as number of links and trackbacks. The results indicate that IDM performs better in finding blogs posted by bloggers with product usage experience or with an interest in the product. A propagation network which visualizes the consumer-oriented key marketing elements is also presented. An empirical analysis suggests the validity of IDM for marketing decision marking...|$|E
40|$|In {{the retail}} industry, <b>consumer</b> <b>package</b> goods (CPG) {{manufacturers}} {{have been working}} with retailers to use Vendor-managed Inventory (VMI) to improve the overall supply chain inventory turns and finished product velocity. This thesis explores those opportunities where a consumer packaged goods company can benefit from using VMI information to improve forecasting. First, this thesis discusses a novel way to compare those forecasts at downstream and upstream demand planning levels. Forecast errors are calculated in relation to the forecast data aggregation levels. Second, a causal model is used to analyze the contributing factors of high demand planning forecast. Finally, recommendations are provided on how to use VMI information and thus incorporate VMI forecasts into the upstream supply chain planning process. by Xihang Kou. Thesis (M.

40|$|We {{describe}} the industrial market structure of CPG categories. The analysis uses a unique database spanning 31 <b>consumer</b> <b>package</b> goods (CPG) categories, 39 months, and the 50 largest US metropolitan markets. We organize our description of market structure around {{the notion that}} firms can improve brand perceptions through advertising investments, as in Sutton’s endogenous sunk cost theory. The richness of our data allow us to go beyond Sutton’s bounds test and to study the underlying forces bounding concentration away from zero. Observed advertising levels escalate in larger US markets. At the same time, the number of advertised brands in an industry appears to be invariant to market size. Therefore, the size-distribution of brands across markets is characterized by bigger (i. e. more heavily advertised) as opposed to more brands in larger markets. Correspondingly, observed concentration levels in advertising-intensive industries are bounded away from zero irrespective of market size...|$|E
40|$|Though {{brand loyalty}} {{has been studied}} {{extensively}} in the marketing literature, the re-lationship between brand loyalty and equilibrium pricing strategies is not well understood. Designing sales pricing strategies involves two key decisions: the percentage reduction in price from the existing price point, and the number or frequency of promotions within a category or for a speci 8 ̆ 5 c product. These decisions, in turn, are critically dependent upon how many consumers can be convinced {{to switch to a}} brand by temporarily reducing its price, and how many are instead brand loyal. Theoretical models of how the size and strength of brand loyalty inuence optimal promotion strategies have been developed, but there are no rigorous tests of their hypotheses. We test how brand loyalty impacts promotion strategies for a frequently purchased <b>consumer</b> <b>package</b> good category.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{industrial market}} structure using a unique database spanning 31 <b>consumer</b> <b>package</b> goods (CPG) industries, 39 months, and the 50 largest US metropolitan markets. We organize our description of market structure around {{the notion that}} firms can improve brand perceptions through advertising investments, as in Sutton’s endogenous sunk cost theory. In the data, observed advertising levels escalate (i. e. larger brands) in larger markets {{while the number of}} advertised brands within an industry remains stable. Correspondingly, observed concentration levels in advertising-intensive industries are bounded away from zero irrespective of market size. For two industries, we collect historic order-of-entry data. The geographic distribution of entry is found to account for the levels, rank-orders and covariation in the geographic distribution of brand shares, perceived brand qualities and advertising effort. Interestingly, alternative potential sources of geographic asymmetry on both the supply and demand sides do not mimic the geographic patterns of shares. In general, our findings highlight several striking persistent geographic patterns in the industrial market structures of CPG industries...|$|E
