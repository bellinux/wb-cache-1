40|$|The {{prebiotic}} {{significance of}} laboratory experiments that study {{the interactions between}} oligomeric RNA and mineral species is difficult to know. Natural exemplars of specific minerals can differ widely depending on their provenance. While laboratory-generated samples of <b>synthetic</b> <b>minerals</b> can have controlled compositions, they are often viewed as "unnatural". Here, we show how trends in the interaction of RNA with natural <b>mineral</b> specimens, <b>synthetic</b> <b>mineral</b> specimens, and co-precipitated pairs of <b>synthetic</b> <b>minerals,</b> can make a persuasive case that the observed interactions reflect {{the composition of the}} minerals themselves, rather than their being simply examples of large molecules associating nonspecifically with large surfaces. Using this approach, we have discovered Periodic Table trends in the binding of oligomeric RNA to alkaline earth carbonate minerals and alkaline earth sulfate minerals, where those trends are the same when measured in natural and <b>synthetic</b> <b>minerals.</b> They are also validated by comparison of co-precipitated <b>synthetic</b> <b>minerals.</b> We also show differential binding of RNA to polymorphic forms of calcium carbonate, and the stabilization of bound RNA on aragonite. These have relevance to the prebiotic stabilization of RNA, where such carbonate minerals are expected to have been abundant, as they appear to be today on Mars...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to provide a basis for quantifying the ability of red sandstone to oxidise dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and determine if results of experiments on <b>synthetic</b> <b>minerals</b> can be applied to geological materials. Ascorbic acid (H_ 2 A) was used as a probe. Preliminary experiments revealed that it can reductively dissolve sandstone hematite and Mn oxide as research on <b>synthetic</b> <b>minerals</b> had previously shown. Sorption of H_ 2 A to sandstone was similar to that seen for synthetic hematite (a two-slope linear isotherm). Anoxic batch experiments were undertaken under biotic and abiotic conditions. Release of Fe and Mn was found to be dependent on the concentration of H_ 2 A and pH. Decrease in H_ 2 A concentration exceeded increase in Fe and Mn concentrations corrected for sorption, and this was modelled by sorption of both ascorbate and dehydroascorbic acid. The rate of H_ 2 A oxidation was higher in biotic experiments than in abiotic experiments, probably due to the differences in pH rather than bacterial presence. The rate of ascorbic acid oxidation by natural oxides was higher than found by previous researchers for synthetic hematite. This result was not expected, and only in part can be ascribed to the effect of Mn oxides. However, the mechanism of reductive dissolution determined by the <b>synthetic</b> <b>mineral</b> studies appear relevant also to the sandstone system. Many questions remain but the study shows that the sandstone provides a significant natural oxidative attenuation capacity and that the results of experimentation on <b>synthetic</b> <b>minerals</b> can only be applied qualitatively...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Recent {{publications}} {{have shown}} for <b>synthetic</b> <b>mineral</b> fibers {{that if a}} fiber dissolves rapidly and disappears from the lung, it does not cause a carcinogenic effect. With asbestos, chrysotile asbestos is often included with other asbestos materials. However, chrysotile is a serpentine mineral with markedly different mineralogical characteristics than amphibole asbestos (e. g. amosite, tremolite). These differences are mirrored in the differences in biopersistence between these two minerals. Chrysotile clears very rapidly from the lung with half-times ranging from 0. 3 to 11 days and produces no inflammatory reaction. In contrast, the amphiboles clear with half-times {{in the range of}} 500 days or longer and produce a pronounced inflammatory response leading to mild interstitial fibrosis. These findings provide an important basis for substantiating both kinetically and pathologically the differences between chrysotile and amphiboles. In contrast to amphiboles, the toxicology of chrysotile can be understood in comparison to non-fibrous mineral dusts. These results fully support the differentiation of chrysotile from amphiboles reported in recent evaluations of available epidemiological studies.

Policy makers are currently {{faced with the challenge}} of designing and implementing strategies to maintain soil fertility and avoid off-site effects. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of organic substrate amendments on soil properties, nutrient leaching and the growth of Ipomea aquatica in an acidic degraded soil from northern Vietnam. Plants were grown in an Acrisol in buckets under natural weather conditions for two months. The same amount of nutrients was applied either in a purely <b>synthetic</b> form (<b>mineral</b> fertilizers) or as two alternative organic substrates (three month old compost or vermicompost from buffalo dung) plus additional amounts of <b>synthetic</b> <b>mineral</b> nutrients to ensure the same quantity of NPK. The influence of these respective substrates on the soil's physical and chemical properties as well as plant growth was examined. Both compost and vermicompost led to an improvement in soil properties with an increase in the pH, soil organic matter and nutrient content, compared to soil fertilized with <b>synthetic</b> <b>mineral</b> products. The highest plant productivity was obtained with vermicompost and synthetic fertilizers, with no significant difference between these two treatments. Chemical fertilization, however, is the least effective practice based on the amount of nutrients leached from the soil (about 38 % of N and 22 % of K, compared to less than 10 and 5 % of N and K with organic amendments). P leaching was not influenced by the fertilizer treatments. In conclusion, vermicompost does appear to be a relevant alternative to chemical fertilizers because it leads to similar enhancements in plant growth, at the same time as increasing soil quality and decreasing nutrient leaching...|$|R
