This paper studies optimal monetary policy in a DSGE model with sticky prices and oligopolistic competition. In this model firms ’ monopolistic rents induce both intra-temporal and intertemporal time-varying wedges which induce inefficient fluctuations of employment and consumption. The monetary authority faces a trade-off between stabilizing inflation and reducing inefficient fluctuations, which is resolved by using consumer price inflation as a state <b>contingent</b> <b>sale</b> subsidy. An analysis of the welfare gains of alternative rules show that targeting mark-ups and asset prices might improve upon a strict inflation targeting...|$|E

40|$|Companies doing {{business}} internationally need a global business plan that includes maintaining a mobile workforce. The relocation {{industry has been}} patiently awaiting a favorable ruling on the taxability of home sale/purchase transactions. Revenue Ruling 2005 - 74, which has been anticipated for more than 30 years, represents an important win for the industry. Since 1972, in Revenue Ruling 72 - 339, the IRS has maintained that if an employer-sponsored relocation home sale program is viewed as two separate sales, then there are no payroll tax consequences for the employee following the second sale. As an alternative to using a home buyout program offered by a relocation management company, an employer could offer a transferred employee an employee-relocation loan or a bridge loan.

Nonconsensual human donations, taken from minors, incompetents and prisoners are regulated carefully by the courts. The Uniform Anatomical Gift Act and the National Organ Transplant Act serve also as statutory frameworks for organ retrievals and allocations and place various restrictions upon each. Altruistically motivated donations at death continue to be an inadequate mechanism for meeting the growing demands of the market. Included among the various approaches to resolving the critical shortage of human organs for transplantation are post mortem harvesting, escheatage, prospective <b>contingent</b> <b>sales</b> and standard death benefit payments – with the latter being perhaps the most attractive in the United States.

The criteria currently employed in WTO and EU proceedings are consistent with correct accounting for the opportunity cost of capital when markets are complete and frictionless, but fail in the presence of payoff-relevant market incompleteness where the interval between bid and ask prices may not be finessed away. An economic definition of subsidy must necessarily capture opportunity cost, and we develop a definition that fully incorporates government’s opportunity cost in both complete and incomplete market settings. With this in hand we then revisit some commonly posed questions concerning the subsidy status of Launch Aid, giving indication of how they may be best resolved by those in possession of the relevant details. civil aerospace; incomplete markets; R&D; <b>sales</b> <b>contingent</b> claims; subsidies...|$|R

[...] Though Arsenal never stated how many bonds were sold, they did raise several million pounds through the scheme.

50|$|Producers {{such as a}} {{financial}} planner or financial adviser can help clients develop retirement plans, where compensation is either fee-based or commissioned <b>contingent</b> on product <b>sale.</b> Such an arrangement is sometimes viewed as in conflict with a consumer's interest, and that the advice rendered cannot be without bias, or at a cost that justifies its value. Consumers can now elect a do it yourself (DIY) approach. For example, retirement web-tools {{in the form of}} a calculator, mathematical model or decision support system are available online. A web-based tool that allows client to fully plan, without human intervention, might be considered a producer. Key motivations of the DIY trend are many of the same arguments for lean manufacturing, a constructive alteration of the relationship between producer and consumer.|$|R
40|$|When {{suppliers}} produce {{products for}} which demand is uncertain, {{they face a}} problem of inducing downstream distributors to stock inventory levels that the suppliers prefer. This paper considers {{a wide array of}} alternative supply contracts, each of which consists of a mixture of constant per-unit wholesale prices, buy-back arrangements, and post <b>sale</b> payments <b>contingent</b> on <b>sales</b> made, such as revenue sharing or buybacks. We show that linear supply contracts specifying any combination of two of these three instruments can implement the vertical integrated outcome for a monopoly, thereby generating the supplier's preferred inventory configuration and price distribution. We extend our results to differentiated product oligopoly, demonstrating that each supplier obtains its preferred inventory configuration and price distribution, given the choices of its rival. Distributors choose optimal inventories from the suppliers' standpoint, even if suppliers do not know the distribution of demand uncertainty, and, given the perfect competition among distributors, all profits in the supply chain are captured by suppliers. Thus, suppliers are able to deal with demand uncertainty with remarkably little information about demand, and without the need to control dealer actions in detail. In particular, suppliers need not specify either dealer inventories or resale prices, but instead encourage distributors to order based on information in their possession and to set prices that generate desirable resale price dispersion.

40|$|In {{an income}} tax system that comported with the economic, or Haig-Simons, {{definition}} of income, deductible expenses would not face source-based limitations. A true Haig-Simons income tax system therefore would not take the schedular approach of sorting different types of expenses and losses into distinct conceptual “baskets” containing corresponding types of income. Practical realities often require departing from the Haig-Simons norm, however. The U. S. federal income tax system does require individuals to basket a number of types of expenses and losses. For example, individuals’ passive activity losses can only be deducted from passive income gains. By contrast, most corporations taxed under Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code {{are not subject to}} many of these restrictions. Thus, corporations generally can deduct their passive investment expenses and losses from their active business income. That ability allowed the creation of in famous tax strategies such as Son-of-BOSS and the CINS <b>contingent</b> installment <b>sale</b> shelter. In order to prevent the resurgence of abusive tax shelters, this Article proposes to extend to the domestic corporate context the passive/active distinction that already exists for individuals. If corporations were required to basket their passive-source expenses and losses with their passive income (such as income from interest, dividends, and rents and royalties, other than those produced by an active business), many abusive tax shelters involving financial products would not work. The Article also considers the three principal objections to the proposal—that it is overbroad, underinclusive, and too complex—and argues that the proposal is tailored so as to minimize these costs...|$|R

The company {{was a major}} publisher in the 16 bit era of games, but the company's sales suffered as it was slow to migrate from older game systems like the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System to next-generation platforms. The company lost $222 million in the 1996 fiscal year due to sales falling to $162 million compared to $567 million the previous year; {{in the first quarter}} of fiscal 1997, the company lost a further $19 million. The company laid off 100 of its 950 workers since March 1996 and its stock had dropped from a high of $13.875 a share to as low as $3. Turok, Acclaim's first Nintendo 64 title, became the company's best hope of a turnaround, as there were only ten Nintendo 64 games on the market, and Turok was the only shooter. Alex.
