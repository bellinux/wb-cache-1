40|$|International audienceThe Gulf of Guinea (GG) is an {{area where}} a {{seasonal}} upwelling takes place, along the equator and its northern coasts between Benin and Cote d'Ivoire. The coastal upwelling has a real impact on the local yet documented biological resources. However, <b>climatic</b> <b>impact</b> <b>studies</b> of this seasonal upwelling are paradoxically very rare and disseminated and this impact is still little known, especially on the potential part played by the upwelling onset on the regional precipitation in early boreal summer. This study shows that coastal precipitations of the July-September period are correlated by both the coastal and equatorial sea-surface temperatures (SSTS). This correlation results in a decrease or a rise of rainfall when the SSTs are abnormally cold or warm respectively. The coastal areas that are more subject to coastal and equatorial SSTs influence are located around the Cape Three Points, where the coastal upwelling exhibits the maximum of amplitude...|$|R

Most <b>climatic</b> <b>impact</b> <b>studies</b> rely on changes in the average values of meteorological variables such as temperature. This paper attempts to study the temporal changes in the mean value of the air surface temperature over Jakarta city during the last century, specifically in the period 1901 – 2002. The data used in this study were taken from the Jakarta Climatology Station because they are of are good quality, there are extensive records and there is little missing or blank data. Statistic descriptive methods were employed, including a description of the type of probabilistic model chosen to represent the monthly mean air surface temperature time series. The long-term change in temperature was evaluated using the Mann-Kendall trend test method and the statistical linear trend test; the results of these two tests agreed. During the last 100 years, data observations from the station indicate that the monthly mean value of the air surface temperature of Jakarta city has increased at a rate of about 0. 152 °C decade– 1 and has not exhibited variability signals but has changed on average. Based on the linear regression model, the mean value of the air surface temperature over Jakarta city is estimated to reach around 28. 5 °C in 2050 and 29. 23 °C in 2100...|$|R

To quantify and compare the soil GHG fluxes of the excavation drier and the traditional milling methods, {{as well as the}} areas from which the energy peat is planned to be extracted in the future (extraction reserve area types), soil CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O fluxes were measured during 2006 – 2007 at three sites in Finland. Within each site, fluxes were measured from drained extraction reserve areas, extraction fields and stockpiles of both methods and additionally from the biomass driers of the excavation-drier method. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), described at a principal level in ISO Standards 14040 : 2006 and 14044 : 2006, was used to assess the long-term (100 years) <b>climatic</b> <b>impact</b> from peatland utilisation with respect to land use and energy production chains where utilisation of coal was replaced with peat.

Since groups (Coda) react to environmental constrains with an analogous response, this approach was adopted to compare the structure and the biomass of phytoplankton assemblages in two different Mediterranean ponds, one temporary and the other permanent. A phytoplankton survey, carried out monthly in the brackish and shallow Biviere di Gela in 2005 - 2007, revealed a deep transformation {{in the structure of}} its phytoplankton assemblage as compared with similar data collected in 1987 - 1988. A progressive shift from a clear water macrophyte-dominated state to a turbid cyanobacteria-dominated one was observed together with a transition from a given set of Coda to another one. In addition to the effect driven by the climate, an alteration of the original composition was induced by an anthropogenic-mediated decrease in the electrical conductivity of the water that likely opened the way to a toxic alga, Prymnesium parvum, whose allelopathyc and toxic glycosides further contributed to the transformation of the lake biota.

It is beyond a general computation to create an appropriate portrait of water circumstances with a parsimonious equation that should be considered as an art.

40|$|The American pika (Ochotona princeps) is {{considered}} a sentinel species for detecting ecological effects of climate change. Pikas are declining within {{a large portion of}} their range, but previous studies have focused only on local pika extirpation as a metric of change. This approach {{does not take into account}} the role of behavioral thermoregulation and the pika 2 ̆ 7 s use of microhabitats to ameliorate variations in climate. Without evidence of a direct <b>climatic</b> <b>impact</b> on pikas, <b>studies</b> correlating pika habitat occupancy with climate metrics provide relatively weak support for projecting effects of climate change on this species. This dissertation research focuses on the physiological stress response of pikas to differences in microhabitat and microclimate. First, I developed and validated bio-assays to measure physiological stress in pikas. Second, relationships were established between pika stress and habitat characteristics associated with sub-surface ice features, which are an important component of water resources. Third, I examined effects of local climate on stress, while accounting for the influence of environmental characteristics on a frequently used stress metric (fecal CORT). Lastly, annual individual survival was analyzed in relation to two different stress metrics (fecal and plasma CORT). Research efforts resulted in the establishment of non-invasive methods for estimating stress in pikas, and also emphasize the importance of considering environmental influences on stress measurements collected non-invasively across different eco-regions. Additional results suggest that pikas may serve as a sensitive bio-indicator of hydrological change in high elevation watershed areas. Finally, pikas appear to be experiencing chronic stress, and reduced survival, in some microhabitats regardless of behavioral adaptations...|$|R

As {{part of a}} {{long-term}} effort to both improve access to information on climate change and freshwater resources, and to understand {{the state of the}} science, we compiled an electronic bibliography of scientific literature in that area. We analyzed the distribution of information on <b>climatic</b> <b>impacts</b> on freshwater resources, with an emphasis on differences between developed and developing regions as well as differences in the types and focus of research carried out among regions. There has been more research overall in developed countries than in the developing world. Proportionally more of the available research on natural and human systems pertains to developed regions, while most of the analysis done in developing countries is limited to higher-level climatology and hydrology. We argue that scientific information and understanding are important elements of the ability to adapt to potential climatic changes. The distribution of the scientific literature in our database suggests that the types of science most directly relevant to adaptive capacity are skewed towards developed countries, which may exacerbate existing disparities in adaptive capacity, and ultimately worsen the consequences of <b>climatic</b> <b>impacts</b> in developing countries. 1...|$|R
