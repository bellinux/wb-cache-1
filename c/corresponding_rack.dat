5000|$|James Pilbrow; he {{proposed}} a loose piston fitted with a toothed rack; cog wheels would be turned by it, and they were on spindle passing through glands {{to the outside of}} the tube; the leading carriage of the train would have a <b>corresponding</b> <b>rack</b> and be impelled forward by the rotation of the cog wheels. Thus the vehicle would keep pace with the piston exactly, without any direct connection to it.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second reason}} is that like all mature technologies, video tubes had progressed to a high {{standard}} of quality and were [...] "standard issue" [...] equipment to networks and production entities. Those entities had a substantial investment in not only tube cameras, {{but also in the}} ancillary equipment needed to correctly process tube-derived video. A switchover to solid-state image sensors would render much of that equipment (and the investments behind it) obsolete and would require new equipment optimized to work well with solid-state sensors, just as the old equipment was optimized for tube-sourced video. It's difficult to justify junking a perfectly good camera along with <b>corresponding</b> <b>rack</b> of outboard gear, especially if one is the accountant.|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} {{to assess the}} raking {{performance}} of Platform timber framed walls, is provided in this study: each component of the unit wall assembly is assumed as rigid, hence allowing to drastically reduce {{the overall number of}} DoFs involved within the model. The timber frame in particular, is modelled as a mechanism, having only two DoFs (regardless of the number of studs) corresponding to the horizontal and rotational displacements of the header beam. For a given imposed horizontal displacement ∆_h, the <b>corresponding</b> <b>racking</b> load P (∆_h) is computed by numerical relaxation, allowing to consider a continuous function to represent the load-slip curves of the connections. A comparison of the numerical analysis against laboratory test results is provided, showing the method's capability in predicting the raking strength of the wall, despite the assumed reduced number of DoFs...|$|R
50|$|Combi steamers {{typically}} contain food <b>racks</b> with dimensions <b>corresponding</b> to Gastronorm specifications (GN racks); these racks {{may vary}} in width, {{so they are}} only suitable for certain sizes of containers (GN1/1 or GN2/3). Different models can hold different numbers of racks; typical sizes include 6, 10, 20, 24, and 40 racks. Units with six or ten racks are usually tabletop devices, while those with 20, 24 and 40 are free-standing. The number of racks may also vary from unit to unit, as they are typically removable and can also be replaced with <b>racks</b> <b>corresponding</b> to gastronorm (GR) roasting pan or baking tray dimensions. These racks provide space for additional roasts or baking trays, since these methods do not require deep containers.|$|R

The model was built at a scale of 1 to 14. In the model study, approach velocity characteristics were evaluated for a new trash rack placed upstream of the intake structure replacing the existing trash rack inside the structure. Two modification scenarios were studied: a trash rack with 1. 75 -inch openings (68 % opening ratio), and a trash rack with 1. 0 -inch openings (53 % opening ratio). Flow velocities were measured at 40 locations upstream of the model trash <b>rack,</b> <b>corresponding</b> to points located approximately one foot upstream of the trash rack in the full-scale (prototype...|$|R

Flow velocity measurements were conducted under three flow conditions: 1300 cfs (representing typical flow through the project’s 3 larger generating units) 1000 cfs (representing typical flow through the project’s 5 smaller generating units), and 2170 cfs (representing maximum flow possible through the project’s largest generating unit). Under the 1300 cfs flow condition, the approach flow velocities did not exceed 1. 1 and 1. 2 fps with the 1. 75 - and 1. 0 -inch opening trash racks, respectively. The maximum through flow velocities for the 1300 cfs flow condition were estimated to be 1. 9 and 2. 4 fps, respectively. Mead&Hunt; Wisconsin Power and Light Compan...|$|R
