5000|$|Cryptochromes {{were the}} first blue light receptors to be {{isolated}} and characterized from any organism, and {{are responsible for the}} blue light reactions in photomorphogenesis. The proteins use a flavin as a chromophore. The cryptochromes have evolved from microbial DNA-photolyase, an enzyme that carries out light-dependent repair of UV damaged DNA. Two cryptochromes have been identified in plants. There are two different forms of crytochromes, CRY1 and CRY2, which regulate the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in response to blue light. [...] Cryptochromes <b>control</b> <b>stem</b> elongation, leaf expansion, circadian rhythms and flowering time. In addition to blue light, cryptochromes also perceive long wavelength UV irradiation (UV-A).

In this review, we focus on the role of cadherin mediated signaling in development and stem cell differentiation, with emphasis on two well-known cadherins, cadherin- 2 (CDH 2) (N-cadherin) and cadherin- 11 (CDH 11) (OB-cadherin). We summarize the existing knowledge regarding the role of CDH 2 and CDH 11 during development and differentiation in vivo and in vitro. We also discuss engineering strategies to <b>control</b> <b>stem</b> cell fate decisions by fine-tuning the extent of cell–cell adhesion through surface chemistry and microtopology.

40|$|Wnt/b-catenin {{signaling}} {{is critical}} for tissue regeneration. However, {{it is unclear how}} b-catenin <b>controls</b> <b>stem</b> cell behaviors to coordinate organized growth. Using live imaging, we show that activation of b-catenin specifically within mouse hair follicle stem cells generates new hair growth through oriented cell divisions and cellular displacement. b-Catenin activation is sufficient to induce hair growth independently of mesenchymal dermal papilla niche signals normally required for hair regeneration. Wild-type cells are co-opted into new hair growths by b-catenin mutant cells, which non–cell autonomously activate Wnt signaling within the neighboring wild-type cells via Wnt ligands. This study demonstrates a mechanism by which Wnt/b-catenin signaling <b>controls</b> <b>stem</b> cell–dependent tissue growth non–cell autonomously and advances our understanding of the mechanisms that drive coordinated regeneration.
