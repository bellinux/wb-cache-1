5000|$|CNN {{processors}} {{are being}} used to understand systems that can be modeled using simple, <b>coupled</b> <b>units,</b> such as living cells, biological networks, physiological systems, and ecosystems. The CNN architecture captures some of the dynamics often seen in nature and is simple enough to analyze and conduct experiments. They are also being used for stochastic simulation techniques, which allow scientists to explore spin problems, population dynamics, lattice-based gas models, percolation, and other phenomena. Other simulation applications include heat transfer, mechanical vibrating systems, protein production, Josephson Transmission Line (JTL) problems, seismic wave propagation, and geothermal structures. Instances of 3D (Three Dimensional) CNN have been used to prove known complex shapes are emergent phenomena in complex systems, establishing a link between art, dynamical systems and VLSI technology. CNN processors have been used to research a variety of mathematical concepts, such as researching non-equilibrium systems, constructing non-linear systems of arbitrary complexity using a collection of simple, well-understood dynamic systems, studying emergent chaotic dynamics, generating chaotic signals, and in general discovering new dynamic behavior. They are often used in researching systemics, a trandisiplinary, scientific field that studies natural systems. The goal of systemics researchers is to develop a conceptual and mathematical framework necessary to analyze, model, and understand systems, including, but not limited to, atomic, mechanical, molecular, chemical, biological, ecological, social and economic systems. Topics explored are emergence, collective behavior, local activity and its impact on global behavior, and quantifying the complexity of an approximately spatial and topologically invariant system [...] Although another measure of complexity may not arouse enthusiasm (Seth Lloyd, a professor from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), has identified 32 different definitions of complexity), it can potentially be mathematically advantageous when analyzing systems such as economic and social systems.|$|E

Arrhenius plots indicate a nearly constant activation energy of around 10. 4 kcal mol- 1. Extrapolation to find the Arrhenius preexponential factor, A, is inaccurate because of the limited temperature range studied.
