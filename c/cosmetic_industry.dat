25|$|Surfactants are {{in demand}} {{for a wide range}} of {{industrial}} applications as they increase solubility, foaming capacity and lower surface tensions. In particular, rhamnolipids have been used broadly in the <b>cosmetic</b> <b>industry</b> for products such as moisturisers, condom lubricant and shampoo. Rhamnolipids are efficacious in bioremediation of organic and heavy metal polluted sites. They also facilitate degradation of waste hydrocarbons such as crude oil and vegetable oil by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The rhamnolipid surfactant itself is valuable in the <b>cosmetic</b> <b>industry,</b> and rhamnolipids are a source of rhamnose, which is an expensive sugar in itself.|$|E

2500|$|Skin {{whitening}} {{products have}} remained prominent over time, often due to historical beliefs and perceptions about fair skin. Sales of skin whitening products {{across the world}} grew from $40 billion to $43 billion in 2008. In South and East Asian countries, light skin has traditionally been seen as more attractive, and a preference for lighter skin remains prevalent. In ancient China and Japan, for example, pale skin {{can be traced back}} to ancient drawings depicting women and goddesses with fair skin tones. In ancient China, Japan, and Southeast Asia, pale skin was seen as a sign of wealth. Thus, skin whitening cosmetic products are popular in East Asia. 4 out of 10 women surveyed in Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines and South Korea used a skin-whitening cream, and more than 60 companies globally compete for Asia's estimated $18 billion market. Changes in regulations in the <b>cosmetic</b> <b>industry</b> led to skin care companies introducing harm-free skin lighteners. In Japan, the geisha are well known for their white painted faces, and the appeal of the , or [...] "beautiful white", ideal leads many Japanese women to avoid any form of tanning. There are exceptions to this, with Japanese fashion trends such as ganguro emphasizing almost black skin. Skin whitening is also not uncommon in Africa, and several research projects have suggested a general preference for lighter skin in the African-American community. In contrast, one study on men of the Bikosso tribe in Cameroon found no preference for attractiveness of females based on lighter skin color, bringing into question the universality of earlier studies that had exclusively focused on skin color preferences among non-African populations.|$|E
