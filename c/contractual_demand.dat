40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of jointly managing production sequencing and pricing in a two product manufacturing system where both products (type- 1 and type- 2) are made using the same resource. Type- 1 product is made-to-order to fulfill <b>contractual</b> <b>demand</b> arriving according to a compound Poisson process. Type- 2 product is also made-to-order but to fulfill demand arising in the open market where demand arrives according to a Poisson process that {{is a function of}} a price posted by the manufacturer. The objective of the manufacturer is to make production sequencing and pricing decisions that maximize the total expected discounted profit earned over an infinite time horizon. We characterize the optimal sequencing policy using a monotone threshold curve and the optimal pricing policy using monotone switching curves. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis to learn how the manufacturer's profitability and the optimal production sequencing and pricing policies are impacted by various problem parameters. 16 page(s...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the equity {{component}} of real estate finance [...] the equity portion of the capital stack, if you will. It begins by characterizing the process through which real estate equity is secured by developers, and conversely, how it is placed by investors. It moves on {{to a discussion of}} the typical components of joint venture real estate LLC operating agreements [...] the primary document used to formalize joint equity investments in real estate projects. Through the author's observation of a collection of operating agreements (primarily at the institutional level) governing both operating real estate projects and ground-up development projects, the paper discusses the six primary governance issues that are common across most joint venture real estate projects [...] financing and capital structure, cash management, leasing, investment horizon, dispute resolution and defaults, and certain administrative issues. It further outlines how contractor control, control of the construction process and cash management issues emerge as the three additional critical governance issues in ground-up development projects. (cont.) The paper continues with a discussion of the two primary return structure models prevalent in the market today [...] preferred equity and participating equity. While the models are often tailored to meet the specific needs of parties to different transactions, the primary negotiated variables [...] hurdle return rates, profit percentages (promotes), and carried interest amounts [...] generally remain consistent. The author observes that the level of <b>contractual</b> control <b>demanded</b> by investors does not necessarily increase with projects of greater risk. Instead, the quantity of controllable issues increases. Further, {{there appears to be a}} positive correlation between the level of control demanded by an investor and the investor's level of investment in the project as a percentage of total equity. Additionally, as the priority of an investor's ownership claim rises (i. e. straight preferred equity over participating equity), the level of direct <b>contractual</b> control <b>demanded</b> by the investor tends to decrease. by Eric L.

40|$|Spirit AeroSystems {{is engaged}} in an {{unprecedented}} collaboration to supply a composite fuselage section for a new aircraft program. In most cases, Spirit cannot effectively leverage its composite sourcing experience with other customers {{due to differences in}} material and design. Management of Spirit's global supply chain represents a major opportunity by which cost savings can be achieved, particularly in the initial stages before investment recovery. This is augmented by the fact that engineering design changes are prevalent in early-ramp due to a concurrent emphasis on mass reduction. If a supplier cannot quickly and accurately adapt to design changes on critical-path parts, the resulting delays in production capability can cripple a program. As the aircraft ramps to full production, strategic points emerge when sourcing contracts can be re-negotiated or change/add parties. This internship sought to identify, qualitatively and quantitatively through utility theory, the optimal sourcing targets for each part. It theorized that, at each stage of the product life cycle and dependent on each material classification (commodity vs metal type vs composite type), a trade-off exists between Total Landed Cost and risk elements that can be optimized. Based {{on the nature of the}} commercial aviation industry, critical risk elements were segregated logically between engineering (technological capability), performance (production and delivery), and global (financial and geopolitical) risk. Efforts were then achieved through the design and development of a Decision Support System (DSS), titled a Voilà - a combination of the French 'avion (aircraft) and 'voilà' (behold). Procurement teams are asked to work with suppliers to obtain metrics and survey data as model inputs, resulting in measures of utility for each risk element and cost. The DSS utilizes nonlinear programming to produce a sourcing mix (among up to 10 suppliers) with optimal utility. Finally, a methodology for data-driven continuous improvement of decision knowledge is outlined, incorporating risk-inclusive estimations of Total Cost of Ownership. Development primarily occurred within the framework of Spirit's French final assembly facility and its supply-base. aVoilà was met with favorable response when presented to Supply Chain Management senior staff at Spirit headquarters in Wichita, KS. The prospect of improved standardization and control among supplier selection criteria is desirable. The model's ability to deliver scenario analysis could provide Spirit a baseline to negotiate with - asking a supplier to adjust <b>contractual</b> <b>demands</b> or invest in new technology in order to win business can be justified by a utility improvement. by Michael Thomas Vento.

40|$|Work-for-welfare style {{unemployment}} {{policies have}} been introduced {{in the majority of}} western countries as part of an overarching <b>contractual</b> regime, which <b>demands</b> various prescribed forms of reciprocation of citizens who require government income support. Communitarian scholar, Lawrence Mead, argues that such policies are ethically justified because they demand 'civic equality' of unemployed citizens. This paper contends that the coercive dimension of work-for-welfare has the potential to reinforce public perceptions that unemployed citizens are morally inferior, which itself reinforces the social stigma of being unemployed. Based on this interpretation, the concept of civic equality underpinning work-for-welfare is inconsistent with a belief in the dignity of the individual. One could argue that this belief is an important prerequisite for designing unemployment and employment policies that take seriously the notion of civic equality. To support this paper's argument, it will briefly discuss the philosophy and practice of a Queensland-based employment agency that begins from this standpoint...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} ten years there has been a renewed {{interest}} in providing agricultural insurance in developing countries. However, voluntary demand for unsubsidised insurance products has been low, particularly from the poorest farmers. Chapter One presents a model of rational demand for hedging products, where there is a risk of <b>contractual</b> nonperformance. <b>Demand</b> is characterised and bounded for risk averse and decreasing absolute risk averse decision makers. For constant absolute and relative risk averse utility functions, demand is hump-shaped in the degree of risk aversion when the price is actuarially unfair, first increasing then decreasing, and either decreasing or decreasing-increasing-decreasing in risk aversion when the price is actuarially favourable. The apparently low level of demand for consumer hedging instruments, particularly from the most risk averse, is explained as a rational response to deadweight costs and the risk of contractual nonperformance. A numerical example is presented which suggests that some of the unsubsidised weather derivatives currently being designed for and marketed to poor farmers may in fact be poor products. Chapter Two presents experimental evidence collected from a framed microinsurance lab experiment using poor subjects in rural Ethiopia. In line with the theoretical model of Chapter One, demand for actuarially unfair index insurance is hump-shaped in wealth, first increasing then decreasing. In contrast with recent field experiments where {{it is not possible to}} demonstrate that low demand for indexed insurance is `too low', use of a laboratory experiment with an objectively known joint probability distribution allows normative statements to be made about the observed level of demand. The observed level of demand for index insurance in the experiment is higher than the decreasing absolute risk averse upper bound of Chapter One, suggesting that subjects bought `too much' index insurance. Chapter Three presents a vision of insurance design for the poor. Technically optimal arrangements involve insurance providers, such as microinsurers or governments, acting as reinsurer to groups of individuals who have access to cheap information about each other, such as extended families or members of close-knit communities, who in turn offer mutual insurance to each other.

40|$|Writers {{frequently}} {{insist that}} they are the true authors of television, and that they rather than executives endow television with whatever “quality” it might have. Their claims offer two different accounts of value. One insists that while management generates profits from the hard work of its employees, it adds no real economic value. The second insists that writers alone create a project’s aesthetic value; they produce better work when left alone to do what they do best. Writers often affiliate with labor, as the all source of economic value, to render more secure their claim to the aesthetic approbation, or prestige, now attached to television. However much writers support the efforts of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) to fight for better conditions for writers, in other words, their persistent identification with labor also pays a different kind of dividend: in asserting their antagonism toward studio and network creative control, writers assert their autonomy and, therefore, their claim to respect as true authors of a creative medium worthy of respect, even though writers neither own the copyrights in their work nor control the uses made of their writing. Identifying with labor, in short, allows writers to set themselves against corporate interference in the name of art. The beliefs about labor invoked by the 32 working television writers whom we interviewed for this article therefore possess a significant plasticity. Writers are labor in a way that sets them apart from management, even as they acknowledge their difference from others within the industry who have stronger claims to being labor. Writers are labor, in legal terms, because their employers possess the <b>contractual</b> right to <b>demand</b> revisions of their work. Although that right signals writers’ subservience to network and studio and their lack of autonomy as employees, it also makes available a longstanding and venerable antagonism between labor and management, which serves as the basis of the writer’s literary autonomy...|$|R
40|$|Large scale {{nonlinear}} programming (NLP) {{has proven to}} be an effective framework for obtaining profit gains through optimal process design and operations in chemical engineering. While the classical SQP and Interior Point methods have been successfully applied to solve many optimization problems, the focus of both academia and industry on larger and more complicated problems requires further development of numerical algorithms which can provide improved computational efficiency. The primary purpose of this dissertation is to develop effective problem formulations and an advanced numerical algorithms for efficient solution of these challenging problems. As problem sizes increase, {{there is a need for}} tailored algorithms that can exploit problem specific structure. Furthermore, computer chip manufacturers are no longer focusing on increased clock-speeds, but rather on hyperthreading and multi-core architectures. Therefore, to see continued performance improvement, we must focus on algorithms that can exploit emerging parallel computing architectures. In this dissertation, we develop an advanced parallel solution strategy for {{nonlinear programming}} problems with block-angular structure. The effectiveness of this and modern off-the-shelf tools are demonstrated on a wide range of problem classes. Here, we treat optimal design, optimal operation, dynamic optimization, and parameter estimation. Two case studies (air separation units and heat-integrated columns) are investigated to deal with design under uncertainty with rigorous models. For optimal operation, this dissertation takes cryogenic air separation units as a primary case study and focuses on formulations for handling uncertain product <b>demands,</b> <b>contractual</b> constraints on customer satisfaction levels, and variable power pricing. Multiperiod formulations provide operating plans that consider inventory to meet customer demands and improve profits. In the area of dynamic optimization, optimal reference trajectories are determined for load changes in an air separation process. A multiscenario programming formulation is again used, this time with large-scale discretized dynamic models. Finally, to emphasize a different decomposition approach, we address a problem with significant spatial complexity. Unknown water demands within a large scale city-wide distribution network are estimated. This problem provides a different decomposition mechanism than the multiscenario or multiperiod problems; nevertheless, our parallel approach provides effective speedup...|$|R
40|$|A Professional Project Report {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Master of Water Resources, Water Resources Program, University of New Mexico. A private corporation has proposed to export up to 54, 000 acre-feet per year of groundwater from the San Agustin basin of central New Mexico for use within the Rio Grande basin. This water {{would be used for}} eleven stated purposes. Concerns have been expressed regarding the hydrologic, economic, environmental, and legal consequences. Sustainability of the water supply is an issue, as are effects on the neighboring Rio Grande and Gila River watersheds. A system dynamics model of groundwater and its relationship to the local economy in the basin was developed to explore some of these issues. Subsurface flow between six subbasins was modeled as well as flow to two neighboring groundwater basins. Simulation runs occur on an annual time-step over a 40 -year period. Two simulations are presented: 1) no-development based on historic precipitation and evapotranspiration, and 2) development, which includes a 54, 000 acre-foot per year appropriation. Model results indicate that effects are measurable. Pumping is sustainable over 40 years. Basin-wide groundwater resources decline 1. 76 %. Water levels decline 11 feet. Twenty-eight active wells are projected to become dry. Water volume decreases 4. 78 % or 46 feet in the subbasin where the proposed wells would be located. Water table decreases are averaged for each of six subbasins; wells closer to the pumping center are impacted more than distant wells. Subsurface discharge to the Gila River and Alamosa Creek watersheds decreases 2. 93 % and 30. 2 %, respectively. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using hydrologic values suggested in other studies, viz. recharge, hydraulic conductivity, volume, climate change, and water price figures. Basin-wide groundwater volume decreases 1. 56 - 3. 87 %. Water levels decline 10. 6 - 24. 7 feet. Water volume decreases 4. 02 - 10. 35 %, or 38. 8 - 100 feet in the subbasin where the wells would be located. Subsurface discharge to the Alamosa and Gila River watersheds decreases 21. 7 - 73. 7 % and 1. 67 - 7. 86 %, respectively. Examples of costs include drilling 37 wells and constructing associated pipeline, deepening existing wells, and impacts on endangered species. Net costs over 40 years to basin residents and endangered species are projected to be $ 587, 156 and $ 12. 4 million, respectively, the latter assuming water decreases are not offset or replaced. Economic benefits would come primarily through marketing water outside of the basin. Net earnings from water sales range from $ 1. 43 billion to $ 1. 88 billion before taxes. Legal analysis utilizes groundwater and economic results. As New Mexico Office of the State Engineer Application No. RG- 89943 is currently being appealed, any future application may need greater specificity, as well as firmly show proof of <b>demand,</b> <b>contractual</b> arrangements, and an absence of harm to basin residents...|$|R

Assim, reformas educacionais sÃo propostas com objetivo de adequar melhor a educaÃÃo ao desenvolvimento socioeconÃmico. O aprofundamento do estudo sobre as categorias do pensamento de Marx formam a base para a compreensÃo da emancipaÃÃo humana como transformaÃÃo profunda da sociedade e do papel da educaÃÃo nesse processo. O problema fundamental constatado na pesquisa em relaÃÃo Ãs reformas educacionais Ã que elas ignoram, por completo, o duplo carÃter da educaÃÃo (afirmaÃÃo e negaÃÃo do humano) na sociedade capitalista. Esse duplo carÃter nÃo pode ser ignorado em uma perspectiva educacional que pressuponha o pensamento marxiano. Por isso, neste trabalho, categorias fundamentais de Marx, como o trabalho em seu duplo carÃter (ontolÃgico e estranhado) na sociedade capitalista, a polÃtica, a emancipaÃÃo, o estranhamento, foram retomadas, bem como o estudo do mÃtodo marxiano como instrumento que nÃo se reduz Ã compreensÃo da economia polÃtica, mas como mÃtodo de apreensÃo do real e, portanto, formativo tanto em seu momento de investigaÃÃo como no momento da exposiÃÃo. O objetivo Ã fundamentar e delimitar as possibilidades e os problemas para uma concepÃÃo educacional com base no materialismo histÃrico e dialÃtico diante da contradiÃÃo entre a parcialidade da emancipaÃÃo polÃtica e a universalidade da emancipaÃÃo humana que se expressa na sociedade capitalista e que desfigura a educaÃÃo como potencializadora do ser humano. Tal objetivo sÃ pode ser atingido atravÃs da retomada, ao longo da tese, das categorias fundamentais em Marx. O quadro atual da educaÃÃo, que a expÃe como instÃncia justificadora e naturalizadora da atual forma societÃria demanda o estudo das bases da emancipaÃÃo em Marx, bem como os escritos do filÃsofo alemÃo sobre a educaÃÃo. As consideraÃÃes finais indicam que uma concepÃÃo marxiana para a educaÃÃo nÃo pode prescindir de seu duplo carÃter, bem como demanda uma subjetividade rica e o conhecimento do homem que se pretende como projeto de uma educaÃÃo que contribua efetivamente para a transformaÃÃo profunda da sociedade. The current thesis {{deals with}} {{the relations between the}} human emancipation and education, from Marxâs original manuscripts. The use of categories which draw their origin from Marx in an empty and innacurate way has given place to speculations about education as instance which enables the individual to ascend socially from their skilled inclusion in the capitalist labor market. Therefore, the educational reforms are proposed with the objective of better adequating the education to the social economic development. The study deepening concerning Marxâs thought categories compose the basis for the comprehension of the human emancipation as a deep transformation of society and the education role in this process. The essential issue determined in the research in relation to the educational reforms is that they completely ignore the double nature of education (affirmation and denial of the human) in the capitalist society. This double nature cannot be ignored in an educational perspective which presupposes the marxisist thought. For this reason, in this work, Marx fundamental categories, as the work in its double nature (ontological and questioned) in the capitalist society, the politics, the emancipation, the questioning, have been taken over, as well as the study of the marxisist method as an instrument which {{is not limited to the}} comprehension of the political economy, but as a method of apprehension of what is real and, therefore, formative both in its investigation moment and its exhibition moment. The objective is to base and delimit the possibilities and problems for an educational conception based on the dialectical and historical materialism in face of the contradiction between the partiality of the political emancipation and the universality of the human emancipation which is expressed in the capitalist society and which disfigures the education as a driving force of the human being. Such objective can only be achieved through the recovery, throughout this thesis, from the fundamental categories in Marx. The current education framework, which exposes it as a justifying and naturalizing of the current <b>contractual</b> form <b>demands</b> the basis study of the emancipation in Marx, as well as through manuscripts of this German philosopher about education. The final considerations indicate that a marxisist conception for the education cannot prescind from its double nature, and it also demands a substantial subjectivity and the manâs knowledge which is intended as project of an education which effectively contributes to a profound transformation of society...|$|R
