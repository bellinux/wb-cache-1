5000|$|A {{number of}} {{artefacts}} {{have been collected}} {{by a number of}} researchers who have visited the site including canvas/leather sewing kit needles, thrust block, duck bill leather sewing pliers, percussion <b>cap,</b> <b>nipples</b> and bullets consistent with the calibre, vintage and make of weapons taken on the Burke and Wills Expedition. These artefacts have been compared with the [...] "List of Stores III" [...] from the expedition and found to be consistent with goods that were officially supplied.|$|R
50|$|It had {{a single}} 1.25 inches caliber smooth-bore barrel. The barrel was fed from a revolver-like ring, but with an axis of {{rotation}} perpendicular to the bore, rather than the usual revolver configuration with parallel axes. The cylinder housed 18 copper-lined chambers that were muzzle loaded from the outer side of the ring. The interior side of the multiple-chamber ring was lined with the corresponding 18 percussion <b>cap</b> <b>nipples.</b> The ring was rotated by a hand lever. The gun had a cast iron receiver.|$|R
5000|$|The Plant Camp is {{significant}} for {{its potential to}} contain additional archaeological artefacts associated with the Burke and Wills expedition, particularly equipment associated with Wills' decision to [...] "plant" [...] or bury his astronomical equipment and Burke's order to leave behind everything except food and whatever they could carry on their backs. The Plant Camp has been identified through the presence of archaeological artefacts and two blazed trees situated along an unnamed ephemeral creek line on Durrie Station. Artefacts located to date include percussion <b>caps,</b> <b>nipples,</b> buckles, canvas/leather sewing kit needles, thrust block and duck bill leather sewing pliers {{a number of the}} brass fittings, including a clasp, escutcheon, latch and hinge all suggestive of a possible instrument case. These artefacts date to the same period (s-1860s) as the Burke and Wills expedition and are consistent with items listed in the detailed [...] "List of Stores III" [...] of goods officially supplied to the expedition.|$|R
60|$|It was a clumsy, old-fashioned thing, but the Colonel saw {{the glint}} of a {{percussion}} <b>cap</b> upon the <b>nipple,</b> and {{knew that it was}} loaded. He slipped it into the inner pocket of his Norfolk jacket.|$|R
50|$|The {{invention}} of the percussion cap building on the percussion powder innovations of the Rev. Alexander Forsyth's patent of 1807 (which ran until 1821), and the industrial revolution allowed pepperbox revolvers to be mass-produced, making them more affordable than the early handmade guns previously only seen {{in the hands of}} the rich. The {{invention of}} the percussion cap has been variously attributed to several Englishmen including Joseph Egg, Col. Peter Hawker, James Purdey and Joshua Shaw in the late 1810s and early 1820s. The uncertainty has been compounded because no British patent was awarded while the use of fulminating salts for priming guns was protected by Forsyth's earlier patent. Some French makers attempted to patent the idea including Prelat in 1818 and Deboubert in 1820. Examples of these early weapons are the English Budding (probably the first English percussion pepperbox), the Swedish Engholm and the American three-barrel Manhattan pistol. Most percussion pepperboxes have a circular flange around the rear of the cylinder to prevent the <b>capped</b> <b>nipples</b> being accidentally fired if the gun were to be knocked while in a pocket, or dropped, and to protect the eyes from cap fragments.|$|R
5000|$|The caplock {{mechanism}} {{consists of}} a hammer, similar to the hammer used in a flintlock, and a nipple (sometimes {{referred to as a}} [...] "cone"), which holds a small percussion <b>cap.</b> The <b>nipple</b> contains a tube which goes into the barrel. The percussion cap contains a chemical compound called mercuric fulminate or fulminate of mercury, whose chemical formula is Hg(ONC). It is made from mercury, nitric acid and alcohol. When the trigger releases the hammer, it strikes the cap, causing the mercuric fulminate to explode. The flames from this explosion travel down the tube in the nipple and enter the barrel, where they ignite the main powder charge.|$|R
60|$|As {{soon as the}} {{drawings}} were in his hand {{he took me to}} our gun-room and gave me a quite unneeded lesson in the art of loading a gun--first so much powder, then a wad well rammed down with the old obsolete ramrod; then so much shot and a second wad and ramming down; then a percussion <b>cap</b> on the <b>nipple.</b> He then led the way to the plantation, and finding two wild pigeons sitting together in a tree, he ordered me to fire. I fired, and one fell, quite dead, and that completed my education, for now he declared {{he was not going to}} waste any more time on my instruction.|$|R
2500|$|The first revolvers were front loading, {{and were}} a bit like muskets in that the powder and bullet were loaded separately. These were caplocks or [...] "cap and ball" [...] revolvers, because the caplock method of priming {{was the first to}} be compact enough to make a {{practical}} revolver feasible. When loading, each chamber in the cylinder was rotated out of line with the barrel, and charged from the front with loose powder and an oversized bullet. Next, the chamber was aligned with the ramming lever underneath the barrel. [...] Pulling the lever would drive a rammer into the chamber, pushing the ball securely in place. Finally, the user would place percussion <b>caps</b> on the <b>nipples</b> on the rear face of the cylinder.|$|R
60|$|So Saduko {{went with}} his fifty, leaving me {{wondering}} whether I should ever {{see his face}} again. Then I, my bearer Scowl, the two remaining hunters, and the ten score Amangwane who were left turned and soon were following the road by which we had come down the rugged pass. I call it a road, but, in fact, it {{was nothing but a}} water-washed gully strewn with boulders, through which we must pick our way as best we could in the darkness, having first removed the percussion <b>cap</b> from the <b>nipple</b> of every gun, for fear lest the accidental discharge of one of them should warn the Amakoba, confuse our other parties, and bring all our deep-laid plans to nothing.|$|R

2500|$|The First Model Ring Lever rifle {{features}} a [...] octagonal barrel with a browned finish. [...] The finishes {{of the other}} metal parts are blued. [...] The rifle {{features a}} circular trigger guard, which lies behind the ring lever. [...] The ring-shaped lever {{is used by the}} operator to both cock the internal hammer and rotate the cylinder (as opposed to cocking an external hammer on later single-action revolvers). [...] The First Model was offered in [...]34, [...]36, [...]38, [...]40, and [...]44 calibers with an eight-shot revolving cylinder, though ten-shot examples were produced in very limited numbers. [...] The cylinder features a roll engraving depicting a deer hunted by a centaur and a group of horsemen. [...] The front and rear edges of the cylinder were originally square, though later improvements yielded a rounded rear cylinder edge. [...] These improvements also included the addition of a cutout in the recoil shield to enable <b>capping</b> the <b>nipples</b> without disassembly and the addition of a loading lever. [...] The rifle features a walnut stock with crescent buttplate and a raised cheekpiece featuring an inlaid image of four horse-heads. [...] The First Model is distinguished by the presence of a top strap located over the cylinder, a feature absent from nearly all successive Colt revolvers until the development of the Colt Single Action Army in 1873.|$|R
50|$|The grenade was a three-piece weapon, {{consisting}} of the plunger (or nostril), casing (body or orange shell, containing main charge), and tailpiece. The slightly convex metal plunger was removed to set the percussion <b>cap</b> on the <b>nipple</b> within the casing; the plunger was refitted through means of depressing by the striking of something hard and solid to drive it back. This proved to be difficult, especially in the fray of battle. The wood tailpiece was removed to place the powder charge inside the shell, and then set firmly back in to hold the powder within. Trajectory had to be an arc {{in order for the}} plunger to detonate the piece. A small pressure spring attached {{to the side of the}} plunger stem held the plunger in place during flight. The grenade was stabilized by four thin paper fins set into a wood tailpiece protruding from the rear of the projectile.|$|R
60|$|Then I landed and {{stepping}} into the reeds, pulled off my wet shirt and pants, which I stuffed away into the big pockets of my shooting coat, for I {{did not want to}} lose them, and put on the dry things that, although scratchy, were quite good enough clothing in that warm climate. After this I treated myself to a good sup of brandy from the flask, and ate some food which I seemed to require. Then I told them the story, and cutting short their demonstrations of wonder and admiration, bade them place the Holy Flower in the canoe and get in themselves. Next with the help of Hans who poked out his fingers through the skin of the gorilla's arms, I carefully re-loaded the rifle, setting the last <b>cap</b> on the <b>nipple.</b> This done, I joined them in the canoe, taking my seat in the prow and bidding Brother John and Stephen paddle.|$|R
40|$|Many {{organizations}} seek {{to alleviate}} {{poverty in the}} developing world. One organization in particular strives to improve the livelihood of people in poverty through the technical development of and training in bamboo and rattan enterprises, the International Network for Bamboo and Rattan (INBAR). A team in the Spring 2008 D-Lab: Design class has been collaborating with members of INBAR located in India to develop the processes and tools necessary to make pencils from bamboo, rather than wood. The communities that launch this enterprise will need to outsource the glue and graphite leads required to complete the pencils. Waste is generated by cutting processes used to dimension the bamboo to appropriate pencil size and from {{the parts of the}} bamboo stalk that cannot be used in pencils, the nodes. If this bamboo waste is carbonized to charcoal, it can be made into pencil leads, eliminating the need for communities to purchase graphite leads from an external source. Manufacturing pencil leads from bamboo waste could raise the profit generated by the enterprise, create more jobs, and help to alleviate poverty in regions of the world where it is widespread. This thesis presents factors affecting the feasibility of using graphite pencil lead manufacturing processes to make bamboo charcoal pencil leads using clay as a binder. The feasibility is determined by modeling industrial-scale graphite pencil lead manufacturing techniques with small-scale methods that are replicable in a developing country and then comparing the resulting charcoal lead performance to graphite lead performance qualities, including the ability of the lead to write smoothly on paper and its ability to be erased. Experimentation conducted found that vitrification of the charcoal leads is possible at kiln temperatures in excess of 1250 °C and that a sufficiently reducing environment could be simulated using a <b>capped</b> steel <b>nipple.</b> However, a higher performance lead that makes marks comparable to a graphite pencil lead can be attained by simply heat-drying or sintering the charcoal pencil leads and coating them in wax. by Nadia S.

6000|$|Early in {{my school}} days a boy had {{a copy of the}} 'Wonders of the World,' which I often read, and disputed with other boys about the {{veracity}} of some of the statements; and I believe that this book first gave me a wish to travel in remote countries, which was ultimately fulfilled by the voyage of the [...] "Beagle". In the latter part of my school life I became passionately fond of shooting; I do not believe that any one could have shown more zeal for the most holy cause than I did for shooting birds. How well I remember killing my first snipe, and my excitement was so great that I had much difficulty in reloading my gun from the trembling of my hands. This taste long continued, and I became a very good shot. When at Cambridge I used to practise throwing up my gun to my shoulder before a looking-glass to see that I threw it up straight. Another and better plan was to get a friend to wave about a lighted candle, and then to fire at it with a <b>cap</b> on the <b>nipple,</b> and if the aim was accurate the little puff of air would blow out the candle. The explosion of the cap caused a sharp crack, and I was told that the tutor of the college remarked, [...] "What an extraordinary thing it is, Mr. Darwin seems to spend hours in cracking a horse-whip in his room, for I often hear the crack when I pass under his windows." ...|$|R
2500|$|After {{the onset}} of the American Civil War he {{returned}} to Colt in 1861, eventually becoming Superintendent of Engineering at the factory in Hartford, Connecticut. Richards' first major post Civil War design was Colt's second attempt at metallic cartridge conversion known as the [...] "Richards Conversion". Colt's revolvers to this point had been black powder percussion pistols, where the shooter had to pour black powder into each of the six chambers, ram a bullet on top and place a percussion <b>cap</b> on the <b>nipple</b> at the rear of each of the chambers. However, the US Army wanted a revolver that held metallic cartridges, which Colt could not produce because the Rollin White patent was still held by rival Smith & Wesson. Colt's only solution would be to bore through the rear of their cylinders and devise a new method of ignition and case extraction. The Richards Conversion was performed on the Colt 1860 Army revolver. The caliber was [...]44 Colt and the loading lever was replaced by an ejector rod. This conversion added a breechplate with a firing pin and a rear sight mounted on the breechplate. Colt manufactured 9000 of these revolvers between 1873 and 1878. [...] In 1873 Colt performed the same conversion on the M1851 and M1861 revolvers for the US Navy in [...]38 rimfire. [...] Along with William Mason he was granted patents from 1871 to convert percussion revolvers into rear-loading metallic cartridges revolvers. Those converted revolvers are nowadays identified as the [...] "Richards-Mason Conversion".

2500|$|Early revolvers were caplocks {{and loaded}} as a muzzle-loader: the user poured black powder into each chamber, rammed down a bullet {{on top of}} it, then placed {{percussion}} <b>caps</b> on the <b>nipple</b> {{at the rear of}} each chamber, where the hammer would fall on it. This was similar to loading a traditional single-shot muzzle-loading pistol, except that the powder and shot could be loaded directly into the front of the cylinder rather than having to be loaded down the whole length of the barrel. Importantly, this allowed the barrel itself to be rifled, since the user wasn't required to force the tight fitting bullet down the barrel in order to load it (a traditional muzzle-loading pistol had a smoothbore and relatively loose fitting shot, which allowed easy loading, but gave much less accuracy). When firing the next shot, the user would raise his pistol vertically as he cocked the hammer back so as to let the fragments of the burst percussion cap fall out so as to not jam the mechanism. Some of the most popular cap-and-ball revolvers were the Colt Model 1851 [...] "Navy" [...] Model, 1860 [...] "Army" [...] Model, and Colt Pocket Percussion revolvers, all of which saw extensive use in the American Civil War. Although American revolvers were the most common, European arms makers were making numerous revolvers by that time as well, many of which found their way {{into the hands of the}} American forces, including the single action Lefaucheux and LeMat revolver and the Beaumont–Adams and Tranter revolvers, which were early double-action weapons, in spite of being muzzle-loaders.|$|R
