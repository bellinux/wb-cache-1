40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the design of}} a new non-rare-earth magnetic variable gear (MVG) with 16 electrically <b>controlled</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratios,</b> which incorporates both the concept of the magnetic gear and the concept of the memory machine. The high-remanence low-coercivity permanent magnet material: namely, the aluminium–nickel–cobalt is adopted to realise the controllable <b>gear</b> <b>ratios.</b> The key is to design the stationary ring newly integrated with magnetising windings {{in such a way that}} 16 sets of <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> can be achieved so as to fulfil different driving requirements and road conditions. First, the original MVG, the improved MVG and the proposed MVG are discussed. Then, a comprehensive analysis of the proposed MVG is conducted. Consequently, the proposed MVG is extended to electronic-continuously variable transmission for hybrid vehicular propulsion. By using finite element analysis, the electromagnetic performances of three MVGs at various <b>gear</b> <b>ratios</b> are evaluated, hence validating the theoretical design. Moreover, the process of gear-ratio-changing is simulated and analysed. A quantitative comparison among these MVGs is also carried out. Hence, the corresponding validity can be further verified. postprin...|$|R
5000|$|Following the {{original}} [...] "E" [...] {{series of the}} transmission introduced in the 1998 model year, other variants of the 5R55 transmission appeared. All variants are fundamentally similar {{to each other in}} design but differ in things such as specialized <b>controls,</b> <b>gear</b> <b>ratios,</b> or other elements based on the needs of the specific application the transmission is intended for. The first of these variants, the 5R55N, appeared in the Jaguar S-Type and Lincoln LS luxury sedans, and later in the 2002 Ford Thunderbird. The 2003 Thunderbird switched to the 5R55S and featured the option of Ford's SelectShift, which allowed drivers to mimic shifting like a manual transmission without a clutch. The 5R55S, minus the SelectShift feature, was used in models of the Ford Mustang from 2005 until 2010. The 5R55W began use in November 2000 for the 3rd generation Ford Explorer and 2001 Ford Ranger. Mostly specific difference between 5R55W (wide shift) and 5R55S (synchronic shift) is a different overdrive planet <b>gear</b> <b>ratio.</b> Entry-level models of the 2008 Ford FG Falcon were the newest recipients of the 5R55 transmission.|$|R
40|$|Continuously {{variable}} transmission (CVT) provides an automo-bile {{with the ability}} to change the <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> continuously, which can then improve not only ride quality such as acceleration performance but also fuel-efficiency.

The resultant static and dynamic characteristics provide a nonlinear first-order model with an uncertain time constant and time delay. The nonlinear steady-state gain is ad-justed to one by a gain-scheduled pre-compensator. Thereby the plant model becomes a linear first-order lag system with a dead time. The next step is controller design using the plant model. To guarantee sta-bility and control performance against the parameter variation an...|$|R

Kinematic chains or {{mechanisms}} have conventionally been analyzed comprising of links that behave as rigid members and links assumed to be built at nominal sizes. Such mechanisms, articulating entirely from rigid-body translations and/or rotations and nominally established links may not closely represent the actual real life manufactured parts with tolerances and joint clearances. It is important to identify the allowable variations in the linkages especially when the end-effector of the mechanism generates a path or a function and/or a tightly <b>controlled</b> <b>gearing</b> <b>ratio</b> or mechanical advantage is required.

The application of four bar mechanism in an aileron trim tab system that utilizes a rotatory actuator to move the tab surface is used to demonstrate the band of solutions. Then CATIA VS is used to layout the geometry and design the linkages within the prescribed airfoil. The MSC Adams is used to calculate the initial <b>gearing</b> <b>ratio</b> and for validation of values. A Matlabgcode is developed and used to analyze the effects of the variation of lengths and stiffness of linkages on the tab speed using closed form algebraic solution.

50|$|Closed {{loop systems}} in mobile {{equipment}} are generally {{used for the}} transmission {{as an alternative to}} mechanical and hydrodynamic (converter) transmissions. The advantage is a stepless <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> (continuously variable speed/torque) and a more flexible <b>control</b> of the <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> depending on the load and operating conditions. The hydrostatic transmission is generally limited to around 200 kW maximum power, as the total cost gets too high at higher power compared to a hydrodynamic transmission. Large wheel loaders for instance and heavy machines are therefore usually equipped with converter transmissions. Recent technical achievements for the converter transmissions have improved the efficiency and developments in the software have also improved the characteristics, for example selectable gear shifting programs during operation and more gear steps, giving them characteristics close to the hydrostatic transmission.|$|R

40|$|Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) {{can harvest}} {{a variety of}} {{environmental}} energies including sound, waves, wind, and human motions, but low input energies nomally generate low output power although TENGs have high power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this study, we report the kinematic design of TENGs for improving the PCE. By adopting a gear train in a TENG system, the frequency (fw) at the working gear could be larger than that (fin) at the input gear. Finally, the output energy of TENGs with a higher working frequency could be improved, thus providing enhanced PCE. We investigated the output performance of our gear-based TENG system under input frequencies of 1. 5, 3, and 4. 5 Hz by <b>controlling</b> the <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> (i. e. 1, 1. 7, and 5). Under the input frequencies, the output voltage and current from our gear-based TENG system were enhanced up to the maximum of 3. 6 times and 4. 4 times, respectively. It was analyzed that the PCE was improved up to 7. 57 times at the <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of 5 under the input frequency of 1. 5 Hz. In order to clearly understand improved performance of the gear-based TENG system, we used our TENG system to charge a capacitor by rectifying the output voltage. Under the input frequency of 4. 5 Hz, we obtained a 3 times enhanced rectifying voltage at a <b>gear</b> <b>ratio</b> of 5. Interestingly, capacitor charging voltage was enhanced up to about 8 fold in using our TENG system. It is attributed that our gear-based TENG system could improve simultaneously the magnitude {{as well as the}} generation time of output power, finally enhancing output energy. Therefore, our gear-based TENG system provided an effective way to enhance the PCE of TENGs operating at a given input energy. &# 169; 2016 Elsevier Ltdclose 0...|$|R
