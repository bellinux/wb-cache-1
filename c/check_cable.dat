40|$|Glass fiber technology, {{which enables}} light {{transmission}} and communication over great distances, {{was developed in}} the U. S. and has evolved into a major industry in this country. Continuous innovation is required to maintain the leadership position that the U. S. enjoys in glass optical fiber technology. This project addressed a key quality assurance aspect of glass optical fiber and cable assembly production-namely, assuring full cure of the polymer coating that protects the fiber from physical damage and moisture degradation. Properly cured coatings are imperative for the cable-assembly industry because they provide protection from the environment and assure both mechanical strength and long-term performance of the cable assembly, The industry loses approximately 5 % of its production due to under-cured fiber. This loss amounts to roughly $ 70, 000, 000 per year. The standard procedure in the industry is to spot <b>check</b> <b>cables</b> after production because no on-line method has been available to continuously monitor cure during either the glass-fiber drawing process, which operates at high speeds of roughly 1 kilometer per minute, or the cable-assembly process. Many kilometers of out-of-specification material can therefore be produced before tests catch the flaw. This project strove to eliminate this delay...|$|R

40|$|As a {{first step}} towards the {{development}} of a high field Nb{sub 3 }Sn superconducting dipole for a Very Large Hadron Collider (VLHC), a short mechanical model was built and tested at Fermilab. The aim of this work was to develop simpler fabrication techniques and test new structural materials to use in the dipole model. The coil design was based on a two-layer cos({theta}) approach. The end parts were designed using ROXIE magnet optimization program and manufactured using a 6 -axis EDM machine. The two layers of each half-coil were wound using one piece of cable without any interlayer splices. After winding, a ceramic matrix was applied to the each half-coil and the coil was cured under compression at 150 C. The two half-coils were then assembled together in a reaction fixture for heat treatment at 450 C for 8 hours. After reaction, the coils were placed in a curing fixture for epoxy impregnation.

40|$|Partial {{discharge}} diagnosis techniques using ultra {{high frequencies}} do not affect load movement, {{because there is}} nointerruption of power. Consequently, these techniques are popular among the prevention diagnosis methods. For thefirst time, this measurement technique {{has been applied to}} the GIS, and has been tested by applying an extra highvoltage switchboard. This particular technique makes it easy to measure in the live state, and is not affected by thenoise generated by analyzing the causes of faults ? thereby making risk analysis possible. It is reported that the analysisdata and the evaluation of the risk level are improved, especially for poor location, and that the measurement of Ultrahigh frequency (UHF) partial discharge of the real live wire in industrial switchgear is spectacular. Partial dischargediagnosis techniques by using the Ultra High Frequency sensor have been recently highlighted, and it is verifiedby applying them to the GIS. This {{has become one of the}} new and various power equipment techniques. Diagnosisusing a UHF sensor is easy to measure, and waveform analysis is already standardized, due to numerous past caseexperiments.

40|$|Preventive {{maintenance}} practices {{are listed in}} the manufacturers' instruction books. In general, equipment that requires frequent and extensive preventive maintenance is generally the most costly. The manpower spent on these frequent trips to remote areas is such that it is usually better to invest in a more costly system which requires little preventive maintenance. The best preventive maintenance for the system is a good installation. 7. 2 Preventive Maintenance and Inspections With any system, periodic inspection is required because of the corrosive atmosphere and adverse conditions that exist in underground mines. These inspections can spot potential trouble in the system. Repair or replacement at that time averts the possibility of losing effectiveness of {{all or part of the}} system. 7. 2. 1 Cables Approximately once per month all cables in the communications system should be inspected for kinking, chafing, cracking, wear, stretching, or other signs of physical abuse. Particular attention should be paid to cable glands at the entry or exit points to the various units in the system, where the cable goes around sharp corners, in the vicinity of holding cleats which may be clamping the cable too tightly causing potential damage, and across the areas where the cable is exposed to physical damage from outside sources, such as equipment or falling objects. If a cable is damaged, it should be replaced as soon as possible. It is mandatory that the ground leads and connections to carrier current phones be thoroughly inspected and maintained in good condition, since considerable hazard may exist to the operator or equipment if a ground connection is broken. 7. 2. 2 Pager Phones The most readily available test set to determine if a pager telephone is operating correctly is the pager phone itself. The following physical check of the system can be performed at any phone station. 7. 2. 2 a Listen Circuit Remove the handset from its cradle and listen to determine if the circuit is functional, as indicated by the presence of noise or conversation on the line. If no noise or voice signals are present at the handset receiver, take the following corrective action: 1. Operate the handset press-to-talk switch several times. Any corrosion on the contacts of this switch may cause a receiver to be temporarily inoperative. Repeated operation may clear the condition. 2. Open the cabinet and see if the battery cables are properly connected and are making firm contact. <b>Check</b> the handset <b>cable</b> and its connections in the cabinet of the pager phone, and see if there is any evidence of a break in the cable, corroded contacts, or poor connections. 3. Remove the handset receiver earpiece by unscrewing it counterclockwise (to the left), and remove the receiver from the socket. Examine the handset cavity; in some units, a patch of cotton batting or floss is used as a barrier to reduce acoustic feedback in the handset. If the cotton patch has absorbed moisture, remove it and replace with a crumpled ball of soft rubber, stuffed just far enough into the handset so it will not touch the receiver or switch terminals. 7. 2. 2 b Page Circuit and Talk Circuit Push the page switch, squeeze the handset press-to-talk switch, and call any other phone.

40|$|The {{business}} {{markets of}} today are continuously becoming more globalized making {{the quality of}} delivered products and services more important for companies to achieve customer satisfaction and long-term business growth. One essential part of quality work {{is to reduce the}} costs of poor quality which is partially represented by yield loss. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate why yield loss occurs in manufacturing of radio base stations at Nanjing Communications and how it can be reduced. The work of the thesis was limited to one product group and carried out as an improvement project in accordance to the five phases of Six Sigma’s DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control). Yield loss of radio base stations at Nanjing Communications is measured {{at the end of the}} assembly process where 100 percent of the radio base stations are connected to automatic testing equipment and run through a series of automatic tests. A radio base station that fails to pass the first series of tests is considered a failed product and thereby contributes to yield loss. In the define phase the average yield loss for the past ten weeks was calculated as 83 percent and compared to the target level of 90 percent. A high-level understanding of the assembly and testing process was also created through a SIPOC map. The measure phase established a more detailed understanding of assembly and testing by creation of process flow charts for the whole process. A more detailed understanding of the test procedure was also developed by mapping the different connection interfaces between the radio base station and the test station. This description also made it clear that the test can be divided into test groups consisting of test points which in turn consist of individual test cases constituting measurement values and limits. The flow of information around the test process was also mapped to provide knowledge of where necessary data could be found and collected. The analyze phase started with a breakdown of yield loss where measurement values categorized as outliers were found to represent a large portion of yield loss. Looking into the outliers-category, radio base stations with no fault code given (products that have failed the first test and passed a retest without any action) was identified as interesting. Through brainstorming and an affinity diagram workshop, about causes to outliers with no fault code given, connection issues and different measurement values were highlighted for analysis. Further construction and analysis of Pareto charts showed that some interface connections and measurement values were more frequently involved in outliers with no fault code given. By looking into test points for relevant interface connections and combining these with measurement values the test point External Alarm Check was found relevant for root-cause analysis. An initial time series analysis of the occurrence of External Alarm Check did not lead to any clear root-causes. Through further investigation of the problem together with a test engineer in the production it was identified that the test point failure was caused by improper connection of two cables used during the test. Further analysis of what could cause this improper connection indicated problems with missing connection <b>checks,</b> routing of <b>cables,</b> fixing of test equipment, connector design, and maintenance routines. The analysis of this test point also highlighted problems related to unclear working routines and insufficient documentation of actions for products that pass a retest. Based on the findings the improve phase focused on developing improvement suggestions to minimize the impact from identified issues. Nanjing Communications were recommended to stabilize and align the test station environment, use connection checks for all test points, develop robust connectors, evaluate maintenance routines, standardize retest procedures, and ensure documentation of actions. At last the control phase emphasized the importance of communication between different production sites in relation to suggested improvements as well as ensuring that implemented improvements are standardized and documented for future work.
