5000|$|Deep Dive <b>Component</b> <b>Monitoring</b> (DDCM) {{requires}} an agent install and is generally targeted in the middleware space {{focusing on the}} web, application, and messaging servers. It should provide a real-time view of the J2EE and [...]NET stacks, tying {{them back to the}} user-defined business transactions. A robust solution shows a clear path from a code execution standpoint (e.g., Spring, Struts, etc.) to the URL rendered and finally to the user request. Since DDCM is closely related to the second dimension in the APM model, most products in this space also provide application discovery dependency mapping (ADDM) as part of their broader solution.|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{scale and}} complexity of distributed system motivates the need for autonomous management. One of the key aspects {{in the management of}} distributed systems is the issue of <b>component</b> <b>monitoring.</b> <b>Component</b> <b>monitoring</b> is particularly challenging in large-scale dynamic systems, given the need to ensure that each component is monitored by at least one non-faulty component, despite joins, leaves, and failures, both at node and at network level. This paper proposes that components self-organize in an unstructured overlay network of constant degree {{in order to ensure that}} each component is always monitored by a threshold of other components. ...|$|E

We give {{an overview of}} earlier research into community interpreting, arguing that cognitive aspects have largely been neglected. We propose that in building {{a model of the}} mental processes of the community interpreter, different kinds of monitoring are a crucial and pervasive <b>component.</b> <b>Monitoring</b> contributes to and enables the double function of the interpreter: translating and managing the interaction of the interpreted encounter. We furthermore stress the importance of the notion of professional self-concept for explaining the interpreter’s decision-making and exemplify this by analyzing turn-taking in two Swedish-Spanish interpreted encounters...|$|E
40|$|Manufacturing {{quality is}} an {{important}} factor in global market competition. The implementation of statistical process control (SPC) techniques is necessary if a manufacturing firm desires to be competitive in the global market. With advances in sensing and data capture technologies, large volumes of data are routinely being collected in automatic-controlled processes. There is a great need for SPC techniques for variation reduction and quality improvement in these processes. This paper focuses on SPC schemes that are based on a combination of the process outputs and automatic control actions using adaptive principal <b>component</b> <b>monitoring</b> (APCM). These schemes are more efficient in detecting process changes for automatic-controlled processes...|$|E

30|$|A {{new method}} for {{transmission}} system risk assessment considering <b>component</b> <b>monitoring</b> data is proposed. The proposed SVDD-based approach {{can provide a}} suitable mechanism to map component evaluation grades to failure risks based on the probabilistic behaviors of power system failures. Using the new method, both up-to-date component condition status and traditional system risk indices can be processed with the developed outage model. In this study, transformer DGA data {{have been used to}} calculate component failure risks. The simulation results indicate that transmission system risks are affected not only by component operational conditions, but also by historical statistics data. In case studies, the implementation procedures of component risk evaluation using SVDD and system risk assessment are demonstrated.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{emerging}} ubiquitous networked technologies {{enable to}} integrate distributed software/hardware components to achieve more value-added services. In {{order to develop}} and manage such integrated services effectively, {{it is essential to}} monitor the status of each component during runtime, preferably with an intuitive and visual appeal. In this paper, we propose a <b>component</b> <b>monitoring</b> framework that achieves the following three requirements: (R 1) monitoring status of components, (R 2) control of the components and the integrated services, and (R 3) visualization of component's states. Based on the proposed framework, we have implemented a monitoring system of a home network system, where ten home appliances are orchestrated to provide value-added services. For the implementation, Flash and Java Servlet have been extensively used...|$|E
40|$|In {{preparation}} for future nuclear arms reduction treaties, including any potential successor treaties to START I and II, {{the authors have}} been examining possible methods for bilateral warhead dismantlement verification. Warhead dismantlement verification raises significant challenges in the political, legal, and technical arenas. This discussion {{will focus on the}} technical issues raised by warhead arms controls. Technical complications arise from several sources. These will be discussed under the headings of warhead authentication, chain-of-custody, dismantlement verification, non-nuclear component tracking, <b>component</b> <b>monitoring,</b> and irreversibility. The authors will discuss possible technical options to address these challenges as applied to a generic dismantlement and disposition process, in the process identifying limitations and vulnerabilities. They expect that these considerations will play a large role in any future arms reduction effort and, therefore, should be addressed in a timely fashion...|$|E

This paper develops a PLM <b>components</b> <b>monitoring</b> framework {{to assess and}} guide PLM implementation in small and middle enterprises (SMEs). The framework builds upon PLM maturity models and decision-making methodology. PLM maturity model has the capability to analyze PLM functionalities and evaluate PLM components. A proposed PLM components maturity assessment (PCMA) model can obtain general maturity levels of PLM components based on key performance indicators. Investment decisions should be made from the relatively weaker PLM components {{based on the results}} of PCMA. One developed method of the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (Fuzzy AHP) is applied to extract the premier improvement component needed. The results of a first empirical assessment in a swimming industry are presented, which could be used as benchmark data for the other Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) to develop their own PLM <b>components</b> <b>monitoring</b> framework to increase the success of their PLM implementation.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} detecting anomalies in a software architectural style that is structured with components and connectors between the components. Each component is designed with tasks (concurrent or active objects), connectors between tasks, and passive objects accessed by tasks. Anomalies in the software architecture are detected twofold by each <b>Component</b> <b>Monitor,</b> which supervises objects in a component, and by a System Monitor, which monitors message communications between <b>components.</b> The <b>monitors</b> encapsulate the specifications of objects being monitored, which are represented using statecharts. The execution of statecharts in the monitors depends on notification messages from connectors between tasks, passive objects accessed by tasks in a component, and connectors between components...|$|R
40|$|With our growing {{reliability}} on distributed networks, {{the security}} aspect of such networks becomes of prime importance. In large scale distributed networks it becomes cardinal {{to have an}} efficient and effective monitoring scheme. The monitoring schemes supervise the node behaviour in the network and look out for any discrepancy. Monitoring schemes comprise of <b>monitoring</b> <b>components</b> that work together to help schemes in meeting various security requirement parameters for the networks. These security parameters are breached via various attacks by manipulation of <b>monitoring</b> <b>components</b> of particular <b>monitoring</b> schemes to produce faulty results and thereby reducing efficiency of networks, reliability and security. In this paper we have discussed these <b>components</b> of <b>monitoring,</b> multiple monitoring schemes, their security parameters and various types of attacks possible on these <b>monitoring</b> <b>components</b> by manipulating assumptions of monitoring schemes.

40|$|Optically stimulated {{luminescence}} of {{fine silt}} quartz was investigated to establish chronologies for lake sediments from the British Isles. Feldspar contamination {{and its potential}} effects on equivalent dose (De) determination were examined. A new feldspar contamination test based on the thermal quenching of quartz OSL and thermal assistance of feldspar OSL identified feldspar contamination in samples being treated for 20 min in 20 % hydrofluoric acid. Feldspar <b>component</b> <b>monitoring</b> based on the post-IR OSL/OSL ratio was not sufficiently sensitive to monitor a feldspar component, but is a good indicator whether a standard SAR procedure can be applied successfully, {{despite the presence of}} feldspar. Based on these results we used a modified SAR protocol including a 100 s IRSL stimulation at 50 °C before OSL readout. This protocol could overcome any malign effects of feldspar even for a feldspar bearing polymineral sub-sample...|$|E

The paper includes an example of the tools in use and identifies factors that have been found to lead to {{variants of}} different difficulty. An investigation into the impact on students’ overall scores is then described, with the conclusion that, for most modules, the effect is very small (typically ± 0. 5 %). Factors leading to a larger effect include: a larger number of individual questions with significantly different variant difficulty; a smaller number of interactive computer-marked questions; and a higher weighting of the e-assessment <b>component.</b> <b>Monitoring</b> the behaviour of variants can lead to improvements in the quality of individual questions, better assessment design and enhanced insight into students’ misunderstandings...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a harmonic <b>component</b> <b>monitoring</b> technique {{to study the}} aging of toughened glass insulators. Harmonic analysis theories and the principles of statistical analysis are applied in this finding. Both new and aged insulators are tested for harmonic components with a 240 Vrms AC voltage input. The power spectrum obtained from experiment is analyzed for the potential harmonic component {{as an indicator of}} aging in toughened glass insulators. The new and aged toughened glass insulators' power spectrums are compared to obtain the desired result. The level of confidence for the obtained result is determined by using statistical analysis. It is found that the fundamental, third, fifth and seventh harmonic components have positive results (i. e. the power consumed by these harmonic components increases with the age of the toughened glass insulator). The experimental results show that the third harmonic component is an indicator of the aging of toughened glass insulators...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{variations}} of the atmospheric visibility {{and its relationship to}} the atmospheric particles mass concentration have been studied by using the continuous visibility data of monitoring instrument FD 12 from Benxi air <b>component</b> <b>monitoring</b> station in 2010. The results show that the annual mean visibility is 12. 6 km in 2010, and its daily average concentration has a large variation range. The daily visibility mainly lies in 6 km to 15 km with all the observed data at the rate of above 67 %. The frequency of visibility smaller than 3 km and bigger than 30 km is very low with the rate below 1 % of all the observed data. There has been a low value of the atmospheric visibility in winter and a high value in spring. The visibility and the atmospheric particles mass concentration show negative correlation, and the finer the particles are, the more they affect visibility...|$|E

40|$|A new {{directional}} low-frequency Alternating Current Potential Drop (ACPD) {{technique has}} been developed for continuous in-situ monitoring of creep strain and damage in alloys. The sensor relies on a modified ACPD technique that measures simultaneously both values of resistance in the axial and lateral directions using a square electrode configuration. The technique monitors the variation in {{the ratio of the}} measured axial and lateral resistances, therefore can efficiently separate the mostly isotropic common part of the resistivity variation caused by reversible temperature variations from the mostly anisotropic differential part caused by direct geometrical and indirect material effects of creep. Initially, this ratio can be considered proportional to the axial creep strain, while at later stages, the resistance ratio accelerates due to the formation of directional discontinuities such as preferentially oriented grain boundary cavities and micro-cracking in the material. This ACPD technique has been applied to a series of accelerated creep tests on 2. 25 CrMoV Steel at 650 °C.
