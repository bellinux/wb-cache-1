On Vancouver Island the paleorotations are counter-clockwise, and other evidence shows that the tip of the island has been bent, presumably as a result of the collision of Siletzia. The northwestern tip of the Olympic Peninsula also shows <b>counter-clockwise</b> <b>rotation,</b> of around 45 degrees. This raises a question of how much of the arcuate shape of the Crescent Formation is due to loss of material from the center after uplift by the Olympic Mountains, and how much reflects oroclinal bending.|$|E

A survey of the oceanic lithosphere subducting below Southwest Japan along the central Nankai Trough revealed the existence of several north-south basement troughs. They are probably transform faults related to a north-south spreading system.

If this system was already active before that time, i. e. during the N 55 ° opening of the southeastern basin, then a triple junction should be found between both areas. Based on these data and previous tudies we present a new interpretation of magnetic anomalies over the whole basin. From early east-west rifting to late north-south spreading, opening of the Shikoku Basin proceeded through multiple episodes of spreading. The analysis of magnetic anomalies constrains the kinematic evolution of the basin through time and space.
