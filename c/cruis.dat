As Wonder Woman leads the Justice League Dark to go look for Pandora, Cyborg is among the superheroes that remain at A.R.G.U.S. while Batman, Flash, Aquaman, Shazam, Steve Trevor, the Justice League of America, Zatanna, and Phantom Stranger go to stop Wonder Woman. Cyborg was present when Atom tells him, Superman, Element Woman and Firestorm the true purpose {{of the creation of}} the Justice League of America and that she was spying on the Justice League which is how the Justice League of America ended up in Kahndaq. When the Crime Syndicate arrives on Prime Earth, Cyborg's old prosthetic parts combine to form a robot called Grid (who is operated by a sentient computer virus). During the Forever Evil event, after Batman and Catwoman drop Cyborg off to his father in Detroit, he makes the choice to willingly receive a new cybernetic body and helps his father and Dr. Morrow create one that is slimmer in appearance so Cyborg could look more human. Working together with the Metal Men created by Doc Magus, Cyborg succeeds in shutting down Grid. Afterwards Cyborg helped newcomer to the group Shazam fit in with the league as the rest set out to find Power ring's missing accessory which flew off after the death of the former wearer.

In MGDA, a direction of search for which the directional gradients of the objective functions are all negative, and often equal by construction [12], is identified and used in a steepest-descent-type iteration. The method converges to Pareto-optimal points. MGDA is here briefly reviewed to outline its principal theoretical properties and applied first to a classical mathematical test-case for illustration. The method is then ex-tended encompass cases where the functional gradients are approximated via meta-models, as it {{is often the case}} in complex situations, and demonstrated on three optimum-shape design problems in compressible aerodynamics.

40|$|The wind drift {{motion of}} the water which is {{produced}} by {{the stress of the}} wind exerted upon the surface of the ocean is described by Ekmans theory (1905). Using the mean monthly values for the wind stress and SST, seasonal Ekman transport for the Persian Gulf was computed and contoured. The geostrophic winds have combined with the SST to estimate the effect of cooling due to Ekman transport of colder northern waters and inflow from the Oman Sea. The monthly SST mainly obtained from the 10 10 grided data of Levitus atlas and Hormuz <b>Cruis</b> Experiment for 1997.   Analyses show a NW to SE Ekman transport due to wind stress and significant interannual variability of SST on sea surface in the Persian Gulf. The seasonal variation of SST shows a continental pattern due to severe interaction between the land and sea. But these variations somehow moderates because of Ekman transport in Persian Gulf...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} cost-optimized flight procedures for a commuter jet, ERJ 145 LU. The aim was to provide the operator, Finnish Commuter Airlines Oy, for whom this investigation was done, with documentation to improve cost efficiency in their ERJ 145 LU flight operations. Knowledge of company cost structure and cost drivers is of significant value in determining the airline strategy in cost optimization. For this purpose, this thesis reviews operating costs, cost drivers and cost reduction potential. In the performance calculations, Embraer performance programs were used. Validation of the programs was done as comparison between program performance data and actual aircraft performance. Actual aircraft performance data was obtained through performance monitoring on flights. The cost optimization of flight procedures was divided into vertical and lateral flight path optimization. First, the vertical flight path was studied by dividing the flight profile into climb, cruise and descent segments. Climb and descent schedules were evaluated for the most cost-efficient procedure in different conditions. In <b>cruis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background. There are no internationally {{recognized}} guidelines regarding HIV for employees on cruise ships. The {{aim of the}} study was to survey and compare current practices for crews in the cruise industry regarding HIV testing and prevention. Material and methods. Medical representatives from cruise companies were invited to com-plete a questionnaire on their company’s practices regarding HIV-related issues. Results. Fifteen of 18 invited representatives completed the questionnaire on behalf of 24 com-panies with a total of 155 ships. All 8 companies with a medical department had a written HIV policy, versus 4 of 16 companies that handled medical crew issues through independent medi-cal consultant services. Thirteen companies required pre-sea HIV testing, 12 had a written HIV policy regarding HIV testing and prevention, and 18 had free condoms for the crew. A positive HIV test would result in revocation of the employment offer from 5 companies and in another 6 companies establish HIV as a pre-existing condition. Eight companies required HIV+ seafarers to demonstrate stability at regular intervals as a condition for sailing. Conclus ions. Cruise companies have different practices regarding HIV in crew.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{intercontinental}} transportation is increasing {{and people are}} requesting short travel times, which supersonic air transportation would enable. However, besides noise and sonic boom issues, which we are not referring to in this investigation, 5 emissions from supersonic aircraft are known to alter the atmospheric composition, in particular the ozone layer, and hence affect climate significantly more than subsonic aircraft. Here, we suggest a metric to quantitatively assess different options for supersonic transport {{with regard to the}} potential destruction of the ozone layer and climate impacts. Options for fleet size, engine technology (nitrogen oxide emission level), <b>cruis</b> 10 ing speed, range, and cruising altitude, are analyzed, based on SCENIC emissions scenarios for 2050, which underlay the requirements to be as realistic as possible in terms of e. g. economic markets and profitable market penetration. This methodology is based on a number of atmosphere-chemistry and climate models to reduce mode dependencies. The model results differ significantly in terms of the response to a re 15 placement of subsonic aircraft by supersonic aircraft. However, model differences are smaller when comparing the different options for a supersonic fleet. The base scenario, where supersonic aircraft get in service in 2015, a first fleet fully operational in 2025 and a second in 2050, lead in our simulations to a near surface temperature increase in 2050 of around 7 mK and with constant emissions afterwards to around 21 mK in 2100. The related total radiative forcing amounts to 22 mW/m 2 20 in 2050, with an uncertainty between 9 and 29 mW/m 2. A reduced supersonic cruise altitude or speed (from March 2 to Mach 1. 6) reduces both, climate impact and ozone destruction, by around 40 %. An increase in the range of the supersonic aircraft leads to more emissions at lower latitudes since more routes to SE Asia are taken into account, which increases ozone 25 depletion, but reduces climate impact compared to the base case...|$|E
40|$|This cruise report covers {{scientific}} operations {{conducted during}} RRS James Cook Cruise 103. The {{purpose of the}} cruise was the refurbishment of an array of moorings spanning the latitude of 26. 5 °N from the Bahamas to the Canary Islands. Cruise JC 103 departed from Port of Spain on Wednesday 23 rd April 2014, calling twice at Nassau, Bahamas before finally docking in Santa Cruz de Tenerife on Wednesday 3 rd June 2014. The moorings {{are part of a}} purposeful Atlantic wide mooring array for monitoring the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and the associated heat transport. The array is a joint UK-US programme and is known as the RAPID-MOCHA array. During JC 103 moorings were serviced at sites: WBAL, WBADCP, WB 1, WB 2, WB 2 L, WBH 2, WB 4, WB 4 L, WB 6, MAR 0, MAR 1, MAR 1 L, MAR 2, MAR 3, MAR 3 L, EB 1, EB 1 L, EBHi, EBH 1, EBH 1 L, EBH 2, EBH 3, EBH 4, EBH 4 L. Sites with suffix ‘L’ denote landers fitted with bottom pressure recorders, WBADCP is a bottom mounted 75 kHz ADCP. At the other sites moorings were equipped with CTDs and current meters. CTDs with oxygen sensors were, for the first time, deployed at WB 1, WBH 2, and WB 4. Additionally two PIES (pressure and inverted echo sounder instruments) were recovered but not re-deployed at sites WBP 1 and EBP 2. Mooring MAR 0 was not able to be recovered but was redeployed. A sediment trap mooring NOGST was also recovered and redeployed for the Ocean Biogeochemistry and Ecosystems Group at the NOCS. CTD stations were conducted throughout the cruise for purposes of providing pre- and post- deployment calibrations for mooring instrumentation and for testing mooring releases prior to deployment. Shipboard underway measurements were systematically logged, processed and calibrated, including: surface meteorology, 5 m depth sea temperatures and salinities, water depth, and navigation. Water velocity profiles from 15 m to approximately 800 m depth were obtained using the two vessel mounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (one 75 kHz and one 150 kHz).

40|$|Core top {{samples from}} Indonesian and {{northeast}} Atlantic depth transects {{were used to}} calibrate Mg/Ca and Î´ 18 O in tests of the calcitic benthic foraminifer Hyalinea balthica to bottom water temperature between 4 Â°C and 13 Â°C. This shallow infaunal species is primarily abundant in neritic to upper bathyal sediments (< 600 m). Both linear and exponential calibrations suggest a temperature sensitivity of â¼ 12 % per Â°C that is â¼ 4 times higher than observed in other species of deep-sea benthic foraminifera. Culture experiments support the core top calibration. We find no discernible effect of salinity and saturation on Mg/Ca. Comparison between the measured benthic foraminiferal Î´ 18 O and predicted equilibrium values suggests that on average H. balthica Î´ 18 O is 0. 64 â° Â± 0. 13 â° lower than predicted from the equilibrium composition. To test the reliability of using paired H. balthica Mg/Ca and Î´ 18 O measurements for reconstructing seawater Î´ 18 Osw and salinity, we apply this calibration to another depth transect from Cape Ghir off NW Africa, which {{was not included in}} the calibration. Based on error analysis of the calibration data and this validation test, we show that the uncertainty of reconstructing bottom water temperature and salinity from paired Mg/Ca and Î´ 18 O measurements of H. balthica is better than Â± 0. 7 Â°C and Â± 0. 69 practical salinity scale, respectively. The small uncertainties allow for the reconstruction of seawater density to better than 0. 3 ÏÎ¸ units, which is precise enough for the identification of specific water masses and reconstruction of changes in their properties. We propose that the relatively high Mg content and temperature sensitivity of H. balthica might be due to minor, biologically mediated contribution of high-Mg calcite to the primarily low Mg calcite test, which is influenced by the ambient temperature. This hypothesis, if correct, suggests that benthic species with relatively high Mg/Ca may be better suited for deepwater temperature reconstructions than species that have thus far been more commonly used.

40|$|Nesta tese proponho uma problematiza????o a respeito da {{interface}} entre cinema e educa????o. Diferente dos discursos e das propostas que centralizam o v??nculo entre cinema e educa????o a partir da incorpora????o de filmes como recurso did??tico ou como um meio capaz de representar situa????es educativas, durante esta pesquisa trabalhei determinados conceitos te??ricos com o objetivo de sustentar a ideia de que o cinema ?? um dispositivo que produz efeitos de educabilidade a partir da afec????o com a imagem em fluxo. Nessa perspectiva, refiro-me a uma forma de educa????o de si que ocorre atrav??s da experi??ncia vivida em contato com os filmes. Sustento minha argumenta????o na teoria do cinema desenvolvida por Gilles Deleuze, principalmente suas ideias sobre a imagem-tempo. Deleuze desenvolve a ideia de que o cinema ?? um acontecimento capaz de fazer pensar, de gerar o impens??vel no pensamento, de suscitar a cria????o de conceitos e a constitui????o de problemas que seriam respons??veis por uma nova imagem do pensamento, ou do pensamento sem imagens, que comece pela diferen??a. Defendo que o potencial educativo do cinema ?? da ordem da express??o filos??fica, de uma filosofia da diferen??a, e encontra-se na sua capacidade de produzir pensamentos. Para tanto o conceito de "crueldade" ?? uma forma de express??o que vai al??m da representa????o, e est?? presente na superf??cie do filme; essas imagens nos afectam, fazendo aflorar pensamentos novos, sem representa????o, pensamentos sem imagens. A tese foi realizada atrav??s do m??todo cartogr??fico, assim, o mapa foi constitu??do tendo como refer??ncia emp??rica seis filmes contempor??neos para, a partir das contribui????es de alguns autores, como Gilles Deleuze, Antonin Artaud, Friederich Nietzsche, entre outros, identificar imagens <b>cru??is</b> capazes de gerar o impens??vel no pensamento. In {{this thesis}} I propose a problematization concerning {{the interface between}} cinema and education. Unlike speeches and proposals which focus on the link between cinema and education through the introduction of movies as a didactic resource or as a mean capable of representing educational situations, during this research I worked on certain theoretical concepts with the purposes of supporting {{the idea that the}} cinema is a device which produces educability effects based on the condition with the image frame. In this perspective, I refer to a way of individual education which occurs through the experience acquired by watching movies. I reinforce my arguments on the cinema theory presented by Gilles Deleuze, mainly his ideas on image-time. Deleuze develops the idea that the cinema is an event which may make one think, leading to the unthinkable in thoughts, fostering the creation of concepts and the idea of problems which would be responsible for a new thinking image, or thinking without images, which starts from the difference. I defend that the educational power of cinema is rather a philosophical expression, a philosophy of difference, and it is found in its capacity to produce thinking. In order to do so, the concept of "cruelty" is a form of expression which goes beyond representation, and is present in the content of the film; these images affect us, bringing out new thoughts, with no representation, thoughts with no images. This thesis is a mapping, done with the cartographic method, which takes as empirical reference some contemporary movies to, based on the contribution of some authors, such as Gilles Deleuze, Antonin Artaud, Friederich Nietzsche, among others, try to identify cruel images which might enable creating the unthinkable in the thought...|$|E
