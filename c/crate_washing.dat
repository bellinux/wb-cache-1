40|$|The {{withdrawal}} of feed from the pens of broiler chickens {{for several hours}} before they are shipped for slaughter is an increasingly common practice, {{whose objective is to}} decrease fecal contamination of birds during processing. In this study, Salmonella typhimurium-infected market age broiler chickens were subjected to feed withdrawal for eight hours, then placed in crates for 18 hours before they were killed and weighed. The intestines, ceca, and cloacal feces were weighed and cultured for salmonellae. The feces deposited in the crates were also weighed and cultured. The results were compared with those of control birds whose feed was not withdrawn before they were placed in crates. The {{withdrawal of}} feed did not significantly affect the total liver weights of the birds, but reduced the weights of the intestines in 7 / 10 groups, and of the ceca in 5 / 11 groups, and dramatically reduced the amount of feces deposited in the crates. There was no consistent effect on excretion of salmonellae. These results indicated that feed withdrawal for eight hours before broilers are shipped for slaughter should be effective in reducing the spread of fecal contamination and of salmonellae during transport and processing, and in improving the effectiveness of <b>crate</b> <b>washing</b> procedures...|$|E

40|$|The {{identification}} of sites resulting in cross-contamination of poultry flocks in the abattoir and {{determination of the}} survival and persistence of campylobacters at these sites are essential {{for the development of}} intervention strategies aimed at reducing the microbial burden on poultry at retail. A novel molecule-based method, using strain- and genus-specific oligonucleotide probes, was developed to detect and enumerate specific campylobacter strains in mixed populations. Strain-specific oligonucleotide probes were designed for the short variable regions (SVR) of the flaA gene in individual Campylobacter jejuni strains. A 16 S rRNA Campylobacter genus-specific probe was also used. Both types of probes were used to investigate populations of campylobacters by colony lift hybridization. The specificity and proof of principle of the method were tested using strains with closely related SVR sequences and mixtures of these strains. Colony lifts of campylobacters were hybridized sequentially with up to two labeled strain-specific probes, followed by the generic 16 S rRNA probe. SVR probes were highly specific, differentiating down to 1 nucleotide in the target sequence, and were sufficiently sensitive to detect colonies of a single strain in a mixed population. The 16 S rRNA probe detected all Campylobacter spp. tested but not closely related species, such as Arcobacter skirrowi and Helicobacter pullorum. Preliminary field studies demonstrated the application of this technique to target strains isolated from poultry transport <b>crate</b> <b>wash</b> tank water. This method is quantitative, sensitive, and highly specific and allows the identification and enumeration of selected strains among all of the campylobacters in environmental samples...|$|R

40|$|Cultural {{monitoring}} {{was used}} to determine the incidence and sources of salmonellae in a 4160 -bird broiler flock raised on litter in 32 pens. Twenty-five of the pens remained apparently free of salmonellae during the 49 -day growing period. Salmonella johannesburg, first detected in the meat meal component of the starter ration, was recovered from the litter of seven pens and from the intestines of dead or culled chicks from two pens. Salmonella alachua was also recovered from two of these pens. Culture of swabs collected from the plastic crates used to transport this flock for processing showed that 97 / 112 (86. 6 %) were contaminated with salmonellae (15 serovars) before the birds were loaded. The crate washer at the plant did not remove salmonellae from these crates: 97 / 132 (73. 5 %) <b>crates</b> sampled after <b>washing</b> yielded salmonellae. Eleven serovar were recovered, including S. johannesburg and S. alachua introduced by the infected flock. Twelve of 31 chickens (38. 7 %) collected when the birds were unloaded at the processing plant were intestinal carriers of S. johannesburg and/or S. alachua and 29 (93. 5 %) were external carriers. Salmonella johannesburg, S. alachua and four other serovars were isolated from the feathers of these birds. Eleven of 25 (44 %) carcasses tested from this flock yielded salmonellae. Salmonella johannesburg or S. alachua, first isolated from the infected flock, were recovered from five carcasses and S. haardt and S. Typhimurium, first isolated from the transport crates were recovered from six carcasses...|$|R
