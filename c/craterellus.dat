5|$|<b>Craterellus</b> pusio {{was first}} {{described}} by Miles Joseph Berkeley in an 1859 publication by James Hooker. Otto Kuntze transferred {{it to the}} genus Merulius in 1891. Until the 1960s, however, it was known as <b>Craterellus</b> multiplex, a species described by Mordecai Cubitt Cooke and George Edward Massee in 1889, and moved to Cantharellus by Curtis Gates Lloyd in 1920. In 1958, British mycologist R.W.G. Dennis collected the species in Venezuela during an expedition financed by the Percy Sladen Memorial Trust. Derek Reid, attempting to identify the species, rediscovered Berkeley's name, which had priority, and described the new genus Podoserpula for it in 1963 while simultaneously describing four varieties of it.|$|E
5|$|Polyozellus {{multiplex}} is edible, and {{is collected}} {{for sale in}} Asian countries such as Korea, Japan, and China. In North America, it is sometimes collected recreationally, and commercially. The taste is described as mild, and the odor as mild or aromatic. Mycologist David Arora claims the flavor to be inferior to <b>Craterellus.</b> Fruit bodies may be preserved by drying.|$|E
5|$|Fries himself {{declined}} {{to keep the}} genus separate, instead classifying Gomphus as a tribus (subgenus) within the genus Cantharellus in his 1821 work Systema Mycologicum, the species becoming Cantharellus clavatus. He recognized four varieties: violaceo-spadiceus, carneus, purpurascens and umbrinus. Swiss mycologist Louis Secretan described three taxa—Merulius clavatus carneus, M.clavatus violaceus and M.clavatus purpurascens—in his 1833 work Mycographie Suisse. Many of his names have been rejected for nomenclatural purposes because Secretan had a narrow species concept, dividing many taxa into multiple species that were not supported by other authorities, and his works did not use binomial nomenclature consistently. Fries revised his classification in his 1838 book Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici seu Synopsis Hymenomycetum, placing it in a series—Deformes—in the genus <b>Craterellus.</b>|$|E
500|$|The horn-of-plenty {{mushroom}} (<b>Craterellus</b> cornucopioides) {{also has}} a blackish fruit body and a smooth hymenium, but is distinguished from P.multiplex by its thin flesh, a trumpet- or tubular-shaped fruit body (rather than fan- or spoon-shaped), and grey to black colors. A closely related species, the fragrant chanterelle (Cantharellus odoratus), [...] also tends to grow in dense clusters, but it is orange rather than blue. <b>Craterellus</b> caeruleofuscus does not form compound clusters, and is not restricted to coniferous forests. The pig's ear Gomphus, species Gomphus clavatus, is similar in shape and form but fleshier, and light violet to pink.|$|E
500|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in the scientific literature as Thelephora cantharella by the American Lewis David de Schweinitz in 1822, based on specimens collected in Ohio. Elias Magnus Fries later transferred it to <b>Craterellus</b> in his 1838 Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici. In 1856, Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis mentioned the fungus in their analysis of Schweinitz's specimens, but changed the epithet, calling it <b>Craterellus</b> lateritius. The motivation for the name change is unclear; Ronald H. Petersen, in a 1979 publication, suggests that Berkeley [...] "was apparently reluctant to surrender his own name for the organism". Petersen suggests that Berkeley may have foreseen the necessity to avoid giving the species a tautonym (a situation where both the generic name and specific epithet are identical). However, as Petersen indicates, a future publication renders this explanation dubious: in 1873 Berkeley again referred to the species using his chosen name <b>Craterellus</b> lateritius, and indicated a type location (Alabama) different than the one mentioned by Schweinitz. Petersen considers Berkeley's name to be a nomen novum (new name), not a new species, as Berkeley clearly indicated that he thought <b>Craterellus</b> lateritius was synonymous with Schweinitz's Thelephora cantharella. Normally in these circumstances, Schweinitz's specimen would be considered the type, but Petersen was unable to locate Schweinitz's original specimen, and thus {{according to the rules}} of botanical nomenclature, Berkeley's epithet has precedence as it is the earliest published name that has an associated type specimen.|$|E
500|$|Franklin Sumner Earle made C. floccosus {{the type}} {{species of the}} new genus Turbinellus in 1909, in which he placed two other North American species. He remarked that the three [...] "constitute a {{striking}} and well-marked genus {{which seems to have}} more in common with the club-shaped species of <b>Craterellus</b> than with the following genus where they have always been placed." [...] This was not widely taken up, as Earle's new combination was not published validly according to nomenclatural rules.|$|E
500|$|Polyozellus {{multiplex}} {{is part of}} {{the group}} of fungi collectively known as cantharelloid mushrooms (which includes the genera Cantharellus, <b>Craterellus,</b> Gomphus, and Polyozellus) because of the similarity of their fruit body structures and the morphology of the spore-producing region (the hymenophore) {{on the underside of the}} caps. The fan- or funnel-shaped fruit bodies of the black chanterelle grow clustered together on the ground, often in large masses that may reach aggregate diameters of up to , although they are usually up to [...]|$|E
500|$|The first {{published}} {{description of the}} species was written by botanist Lucien M. Underwood in 1899, based on a specimen found the previous year in the woods of Mount Desert, Maine. Although he called the new species a Cantharellus, he noted that [...] "the plant is a remarkable one and from its habit might well form a distinct genus since it has {{little in common with}} Cantharellus except its fold-like gills." [...] In 1910, William Murrill transferred it to the new genus Polyozellus; Murrill thought the compound structure of the stem to be a sufficiently unique characteristic to warrant it being separated from Cantharellus species, which have simpler stem structures. In 1920, specimens from a Japanese collection compiled by A.Yasuda were sent to mycologist Curtis Gates Lloyd, who believed the fungus to be a new species and named it Phyllocarbon yasudai.No further collections of the fungus were reported until 1937, when it was found in Quebec, Canada. The next year, Paul Shope considered the genus Polyozellus to be superfluous, pointed out that the compound fruit bodies and the wrinkled hymenium were instead consistent with the genus <b>Craterellus.</b> In 1939, American mycologist Lee Oras Overholts, {{in a letter to the}} journal Mycologia, opined that both of these authors had overlooked a 1925 publication by Calvin Henry Kauffman, who made notes and photos of the species collected in the Rocky Mountains of Wyoming and Colorado, and in the Cascade Mountains of Washington and Oregon. Kauffman believed the species to be merely [...] "a very extreme growth condition" [...] of Cantharellus clavatus (now known as Gomphus clavatus) and suggested there was no reason for transferring the species to the genus <b>Craterellus.</b> Mycologists Alexander H.Smith and Elizabeth Morse, in their 1947 publication on Cantharellus species in the United States, placed the species in a new section Polyozellus, but did not separate it from the genus Cantharellus; they defined the distinguishing characteristics of Polyozellus as the small, roughened, hyaline spores and the color change of the flesh in potassium hydroxide solution, adding that [...] "the spores are unusual for the genus but in our estimation do not warrant excluding the species." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1953, Rokuya Imazeki {{took into}} {{consideration}} differences in spore characteristics: species in the genus Cantharellus were not known to have spores that were subglobose (roughly spherical) and tuberculate (covered with wart-like projections) like Polyozellus; however, these spore characteristics were common in species in the Thelephoraceae family (Cantharellus belongs in a different family, the Cantharellaceae). Other characteristics linking the blue chanterelle with the Thelephoraceae included the dark color, the strong odor (especially in dried specimens), {{and the presence of}} thelephoric acid, a mushroom [...] pigment common in the family. Taken together, these factors led Imazeki to propose the new family Phylacteriaceae. The suggested family-level taxonomical change was not accepted by other authors; for example, in 1954, Seiichi Kawamura renamed it Thelephora multiplex. As of 2009, both Index Fungorum and MycoBank list Polyozellus as being within the Thelephoraceae family, a grouping of mushrooms commonly known as the leathery earthfans. The genus name is derived from the Greek poly meaning many, and oz, meaning branch. The specific epithet multiplex means [...] "in many pieces", referring to the compound nature of the fruit body. Common names for this species include the blue chanterelle and the clustered blue chanterelle. In Alaska, where specimens typically have very dark-colored fruit bodies, it is called the black chanterelle, although this name is shared with some <b>Craterellus</b> species.|$|E
