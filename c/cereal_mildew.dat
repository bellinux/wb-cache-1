40|$|Stomata {{regulate}} {{gas exchange}} and their closure {{in response to}} pathogens may, in some cases, contribute to resistance. However, in the <b>cereal</b> <b>mildew</b> and rust systems, stomatal closure follows establishment of compatible infections. In incompatible systems, expression of major (R) gene controlled hypersensitive responses (HR), causes drastic, permanent stomatal dysfunction: stomata become locked open following powdery mildew attack and locked shut following rust attack. Thus, stomatal locking can be a hitherto unsuspected negative consequence of R gene resistance that carries a physiological cost affecting plant performance. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The gene-for-gene {{hypothesis}} {{states that}} for each gene controlling {{resistance in the}} host, there is a corresponding, specific gene controlling avirulence in the pathogen. Allelic series of the <b>cereal</b> <b>mildew</b> resistance genes Pm 3 and Mla provide an excellent system for genetic and molecular analysis of resistance specificity. Despite this opportunity for molecular research, avirulence genes in mildews remain underexplored. Earlier work in barley powdery mildew (B. g. hordei) {{has shown that the}} reaction to some Mla resistance alleles is controlled by multiple genes. Similarly, several genes are involved in the specific interaction of wheat mildew (B. g. tritici) with the Pm 3 allelic series. We found that two mildew genes control avirulence on Pm 3 f: one gene is involved in recognition by the resistance protein as demonstrated by functional studies in wheat and the heterologous host Nicotiana benthamiana. A second gene is a suppressor, and resistance is only observed in mildew genotypes combining the inactive suppressor and the recognized Avr. We propose that such suppressor/avirulence gene combinations provide the basis of specificity in mildews. Depending on the particular gene combinations in a mildew race, different genes will be genetically identified as the avirulence gene. Additionally, the observation of two LINE retrotransposon-encoded avirulence genes in B. g. hordei further suggests that the control of avirulence in mildew is more complex than a canonical gene-for-gene interaction. To fully understand the mildew-cereal interactions, more knowledge on avirulence determinants is needed and we propose ways how this can be achieved based on recent advances in the field...|$|E

40|$|The two fungal {{pathogens}} Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (B. g. tritici) and hordei (B. g. hordei) cause {{powdery mildew}} specifically in wheat or barley. They {{have the same}} life cycle, but their growth is restricted to the respective host. Here, we compared the sequences of two loci in both <b>cereal</b> <b>mildews</b> to determine their divergence time and {{their relationship with the}} evolution of their hosts. We sequenced a total of 273. 3 ï¿½kb derived from B. g. tritici BAC sequences and compared them with the orthologous regions in the B. g. hordei genome. Protein-coding genes were colinear and well conserved. In contrast, the intergenic regions showed very low conservation mostly due to different integration patterns of transposable elements. To estimate the divergence time of B. g. tritici and B. g. hordei, we used conserved intergenic sequences including orthologous transposable elements. This revealed that B. g. tritici and B. g. hordei have diverged about 10 million years ago (MYA), two million years after wheat and barley (12 MYA). These data suggest that B. g. tritici and B. g. hordei have co-evolved with their hosts during most of their evolutionary history after host divergence, possibly after a short phase of host expansion when the same pathogen could still grow on the two diverged hosts...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable cereal {{cropping}} needs reliable {{disease control and}} various strategies exploiting host resistance have been proposed. Specific (R gene) resistance is unreliable because <b>cereal</b> <b>mildews</b> evolve virulence rapidly. Combining R genes within a cv. might decrease the risk, but, more simply, epidemics can be suppressed by growing cv. mixtures/multilines containing different R genes. An alternative is to breed for durable resistance. Apart from the (exceptional?) case of barley mlo resistance, durable resistance {{is likely to be}} under polygenic control and hard to manipulate. Nevertheless, independent resistance mechanisms can impede pathogenesis at different stages. Even if each mechanism has a minor effect, their combination may confer effective resistance. This conclusion arises from studies that generally use a single inoculation and precisely controlled conditions. But this is an over-simplistic approach to understanding natural complexities. For instance, in fields where leaves are challenged repeatedly, outcome of an initial attack drastically affects subsequent cellular responses through locally induced resistance or susceptibility. New evidence shows such effects can be instigated within 30 minutes of inoculation, probably being mediated via conidial extracellular material. Very recently we have also found dramatic effects of mildew attack on stomatal behaviour. In all barley lines examined, stomatal conductance was reduced during attempted fungal penetration in the light. In suscepts, stomata subsequently shut during dark periods but persistently failed to open fully in light, whereas in mlo barley normal stomatal response was largely restored by 36 hours. In contrast, where R gene resistance caused epidermal cell HR, nearby stomata locked permanently open, even in darkness, thus these apparently disease-free plants were severely compromised. Such complexities must be considered in designing strategies for exploiting resistance in sustainable productionNon peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Assessments of {{epidemiological}} parameters (e. g. infection efficiency, latent period, spore production) {{are required}} for the prediction of epidemic progress, for the estimation of components of partial resistance for different host plant cultivars and for the estimation of fitness components of pathogen isolates. A critical evaluation of methods of measurement of monocyclic parameters is presented, suggesting improvements by using more accurate techniques and taking into account different biotic and abiotic factors. Examples of influence of lesion density and age, of meteorological factors and of nutrient status of the host on <b>cereal</b> powdery <b>mildew</b> and rust epidemiological parameters are presented. The use of the ratio of mature lesions rather than the latent period for the estimation of the development rate of the fungus is suggested to allow comparison {{of a large number}} of individuals. It is feasible to assess the pathogen biomass by the sterol contents. The need to verify by field experiments epidemiological parameters assessed under controlled conditions is pointed out. Finally, the way to include these monocyclic parameters in epidemiological and forecasting models is discussed using the case of wheat brown rust epidemics...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a large}} {{diversity}} of genetically defined resistance genes in bread wheat against the powdery mildew pathogen Blumeria graminis (B. g.) f. sp. tritici. Many confer race-specific resistance to this pathogen, but until now only the mildew avirulence gene AvrPm 3 a 2 /f 2 that is recognized by Pm 3 a/f was known molecularly. We performed map-based cloning and genome-wide association studies to isolate {{a candidate for the}} mildew avirulence gene AvrPm 2. We then used transient expression assays in Nicotiana benthamiana to demonstrate specific and strong recognition of AvrPm 2 by Pm 2. The virulent AvrPm 2 allele arose from a conserved 12 kb deletion, while there is no protein sequence diversity in the gene pool of avirulent B. g. tritici isolates. We found one polymorphic AvrPm 2 allele in B. g. triticale and one orthologue in B. g. secalis and both are recognized by Pm 2. AvrPm 2 belongs to a small gene family encoding structurally conserved RNase-like effectors, including Avra 13 from B. g. hordei, the cognate Avr of the barley resistance gene Mla 13.

40|$|Since 2001, several {{isolates}} of Blumeria graminis, {{the causal}} agent of <b>cereal</b> powdery <b>mildew,</b> maintained on detached leaves at the John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK, have spontaneously become infected with an unknown filamentous fungus whose mycelia have quickly overgrown the powdery mildew colonies and destroyed them completely. A total of five isolates of the contaminant were obtained and identified as Paecilomyces farinosus based on morphological characteristics and rDNA ITS sequence data. To determine whether these P. farinosus isolates {{can be considered}} as biocontrol agents (BCAs) of powdery mildews, we studied the interactions between P. farinosus and the following four powdery mildew species: B. graminis f. sp. hordei infecting barley, Oidium neolycopersici infecting tomato, Golovinomyces orontii infecting tobacco and Podosphaera fusca infecting cucumber. The powdery mildew colonies of all these four powdery mildew species were quickly destroyed by P. farinosus in leaf cultures but neither conidial suspensions nor cell-free culture filtrates of P. farinosus isolates could suppress the spread of powdery mildew infections on diseased barley, tomato, tobacco or cucumber plants in the greenhouse. It is concluded that P. farinosus cannot be considered as a promising BCA of powdery mildew infections although it can destroy powdery mildew colonies in detached leaf cultures and can be a menace during the maintenance of such cultures of cereal, apple, cucurbit and tomato powdery mildew isolates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Protein effectors of {{pathogenicity}} are {{instrumental in}} modulating host immunity and disease resistance. The powdery mildew pathogen of grasses Blumeria graminis causes {{one of the}} most important diseases of cereal crops. B. graminis is an obligate biotrophic pathogen and as such has an absolute requirement to suppress or avoid host immunity if it is to survive and cause disease. Results Here we characterise a superfamily predicted to be the full complement of Candidates for Secreted Effector Proteins (CSEPs) in the fungal barley powdery mildew parasite B. graminis f. sp. hordei. The 491 genes encoding these proteins constitute over 7 % of this pathogen’s annotated genes and most were grouped into 72 families of up to 59 members. They were predominantly expressed in the intracellular feeding structures called haustoria, and proteins specifically associated with the haustoria were identified by large-scale mass spectrometry-based proteomics. There are two major types of effector families: one comprises shorter proteins (100 – 150 amino acids), with a high relative expression level in the haustoria and evidence of extensive diversifying selection between paralogs; the second type consists of longer proteins (300 – 400 amino acids), with lower levels of differential expression and evidence of purifying selection between paralogs. An analysis of the predicted protein structures underscores their overall similarity to known fungal effectors, but also highlights unexpected structural affinities to ribonucleases throughout the entire effector super-family. Candidate effector genes belonging to the same family are loosely clustered in the genome and are associated with repetitive DNA derived from retro-transposons. Conclusions We employed the full complement of genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses as well as structural prediction methods to identify and characterize the members of the CSEPs superfamily in B. graminis f. sp. hordei. Based on relative intron position and the distribution of CSEPs with a ribonuclease-like domain in the phylogenetic tree we hypothesize that the associated genes originated from an ancestral gene, encoding a secreted ribonuclease, duplicated successively by repetitive DNA-driven processes and diversified during the evolution of the grass and <b>cereal</b> powdery <b>mildew</b> lineage. </p...|$|R
40|$|Conidia of the obligate biotrophic fungal {{pathogen}} Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) play a {{vital role}} in its survival and rapid dispersal. However, little is known about the genetic basis for its asexual reproduction. To uncover the primary metabolic and regulatory events during conidiation, we sequenced the transcriptome of Bgt epiphytic structures at 3 (vegetative hyphae growth), 4 (foot cells initiation), and 5 (conidiophore erection) days post-inoculation (dpi). RNA-seq analyses identified 556 and 404 (combined 685) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 4 and 5 dpi compared with their expression levels at 3 dpi, respectively. We found that several genes involved in the conversion from a variety of sugars to glucose, glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TAC), the electron transport chain (ETC), and unsaturated fatty acid oxidation were activated during conidiation, suggesting that more energy supply is required during this process. Moreover, we found that glucose was converted into glycogen, which was accumulated in developing conidiophores, indicating that it could be the primary energy storage molecule in Bgt conidia. Clustering for the expression profiles of 91 regulatory genes showed that calcium (Ca 2 +), H 2 O 2, and phosphoinositide (PIP) signaling were involved in Bgt conidiation. Furthermore, a strong accumulation of H 2 O 2 in developing conidiophores was detected. Application of EGTA, a Ca 2 + chelator, and trifluoperazine dihydrochloride (TFP), a calmodulin (CaM) antagonist, markedly suppressed the generation of H 2 O 2, affected foot cell and conidiophore development and reduced conidia production significantly. These results suggest that Ca 2 + and H 2 O 2 signaling play important roles in conidiogenesis and a crosslink between them is present. In addition to some conidiation-related orthologs known in other fungi, such as the velvet complex components, we identified several other novel B. graminis-specific genes that have not been previously found to be implicated in fungal conidiation, reflecting a unique molecular mechanism underlying asexual development of <b>cereal</b> powdery <b>mildews...</b>|$|R

We report a de novo whole genome assembly and analysis of pathotype 1. The draft genome assembly contained 299, 901, 251 bp with 65, 404 genes. Pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br. ], is an important crop of the semi-arid and arid regions of the world. It is capable of growing in harsh and marginal environments with highest degree of tolerance to drought and heat among <b>cereals</b> (1). Downy <b>mildew</b> is the most devastating disease of pearl millet caused by Sclerospora graminicola (sacc. Schroet), particularly on genetically uniform hybrids. Estimated annual grain yield loss due to downy mildew is approximately 10 ? 80 % (2 - 7). Pathotype 1 has been reported to be the highly virulent pathotype of Sclerospora graminicola in India (8). We report a de novo whole genome assembly and analysis of Sclerospora graminicola pathotype 1 from India. A susceptible pearl millet genotype Tift 23 D 2 B 1 P 1 -P 5 was used for obtaining single-zoospore isolates from the original oosporic sample. The library for whole genome sequencing was prepared according to the instructions by NEB ultra DNA library kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, USA). The libraries were normalised, pooled and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) platform at 2 x 100 bp length. Mate pair (MP) libraries were prepared using the Nextera mate pair library preparation kit (Illumina Inc., USA). 1 ?g of Genomic DNA was subject to tagmentation and was followed by strand displacement. Size selection tagmented/strand displaced DNA was carried out using AmpureXP beads. The libraries were validated using an Agilent Bioanalyser using DNA HS chip. The libraries were normalised, pooled and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq (Illumina Inc., USA) platform at 2 x 300 bp length. The whole genome sequencing was performed by sequencing of 7. 38 Gb with 73, 889, 924 paired end reads from paired end library, and 1. 15 Gb with 3, 851, 788 reads from mate pair library generated from Illumina HiSeq 2500 and Illumina MiSeq, respectively. The sequences were assembled using various assemblers like ABySS, MaSuRCA, Velvet, SOAPdenovo 2, and ALLPATHS-LG. The assembly generated by MaSuRCA (9) algorithm was observed superior over other algorithms and hence used for scaffolding using SSPACE. Assembled draft genome sequence of S. graminicola pathotype 1 was 299, 901, 251 bp long, with a 47. 2 % GC content consisting of 26, 786 scaffolds with N 50 of 17, 909 bp with longest scaffold size of 238, 843 bp. The overall coverage was 40 X. The draft genome sequence was used for gene prediction using AUGUSTUS. The completeness of the assembly was investigated using CEGMA and revealed 92. 74 % proteins completely present and 95. 56 % proteins partially present, while BUSCO fungal dataset indicated 64. 9 % complete, 12. 4 % fragmented, 22. 7 % missing out of 290 BUSCO groups.

40|$|Ergosterol {{biosynthesis}} inhibitors (EBIs) have {{a remarkably}} {{broad spectrum of}} antifungal activity. They belong to the commercial fungicides which exhibit the highest activity known to date. Resistance to EBIs was found in vitro, but the level of resistance and the decreased fitness of resistant strains led to the hypothesis that resistance to EBIs was rather unlikely to develop in practice. Despite the fact that EBIs were introduced as early as 1972, up to 1980 only data on EBI-resistant laboratory strains were available. However, gradually there appeared reports on decreased sensitivity to EBIs in practice. This made it of interest to investigate the potential development of resistance to EBIs in vivo. In this study the pathogen used to gather the desired information was Sphaerotheca fuliginea, as this fungus is widespread in cucumber glasshouses in the Netherlands, intensively controlled with fungicides and resistance-prone. This thesis contains five papers describing several aspects of resistance to fungicides in S. fuliginea. In the first paper {{it has been shown}} that S. fuliginea is present on cucumber plants all year round. A gradual increase in the number of infected crops, in the form of S-shaped curves, was observed from planting until May. In the districts with the highest crop density (Pijnacker), mildew was generally observed early in the growing season, while the apparent rate of increase of infected crops was higher than in other districts. In the district with the lowest crop density (Northern Netherlands), mildew was observed late in the growing season and the apparent rate of increase of infected crops was low. Early in the growing season the pathogen is probably dispersed by transportation of infected planting stock and by man. When the disease pressure increases, inoculum is probably dispersed by wind. This implies that inoculum is highly mobile and that, in the case of development of resistance to fungicides, the resistant strains will disperse to crops where the spray regime did not cause resistance to develop. As S. fuliginea developed resistance to dimethirimol, benzimidazoles and pyrazophos in 1971, 1972 and 1979, respectively, it was thought that presence of strains resistant to these fungicides might provide information on the long-term fitness of these strains. The results of an investigation are presented in the second paper. Strains resistant to these fungicides still persisted in the pathogen population. Although this finding may indicate that the long-term fitness of these strains is equal to that of wild-type strains, several other factors might be involved in the persistence of resistance. From 1981 to 1984, S. fuliginea in the Netherlands was primarily controlled with EBIs. The short-term fitness of isolates of S. fuliginea resistant to EBIs and their behaviour under practical conditions are described in the third, fourth and fifth paper. Several fitness parameters of EBI-resistant isolates collected from commercial glasshouses were compared to those of isolates with a wild-type sensitivity to EBIs. Fitness parameters studied were germination of conidia, growth of germ tubes and mycelium, penetration, sporulation and competitive ability. The results are described in the third paper. One or more values of fitness parameters for EBI-resistant isolates were significantly lower than those for the wild-type isolates. However, in general it was concluded that the fitness of EBI-resistant S. fuliginea isolates, collected in commercial glasshouses, was hardly reduced. Within the group of EBI-resistant isolates tested no significant relation was observed between the degree of resistance to EBIs and the degree of fitness. In the fourth and fifth paper the resistance to EBIs of S. fuliginea over a three-year period has been described. In 1981 the sensitivity of glasshouse isolates to EBIs was lower than that of the wild-type isolates. In 1982 and 1983 the sensitivity decreased further. In 1984, no significant differences in sensitivity with the 1983 level were apparent. Per district, the degree of resistance appeared to be positively correlated to the frequency of application of EBIs. Isolates collected in the district of Limburg, where EBIs were applied less frequently than in the district of Pijnacker, showed a significantly higher sensitivity to EBIs than isolates collected in Pijnacker. Triforine showed a very low efficacy in controlling glasshouse isolates. This is in accordance with the experience of growers who, therefore, only use triforine when the disease pressure is low. It is concluded that the decreased sensitivity to triforine can be regarded as resistance. In the case of bitertanol, fenarimol and imazalil, a change to shorter spray intervals has up till now been sufficient to achieve proper control. Contrary to earlier presumptions that development of resistance to EBIs seemed rather unlikely, it gradually developed in normal commercial practice. The slowly decreasing sensitivity to EBIs of <b>cereal</b> powdery <b>mildew</b> is in line with the results described in this thesis. Strategies to delay resistance to EBIs are necessary. Alternation with other site-specific and multi-site fungicides must be advised and can be applied immediately. Non-EBI fungicides are registered for control of cucumber powdery mildew in the Netherlands. Appropriate information and guidance by extension officers and fungicide manufacturers may lower the reluctance of growers to use these strategies. In the long run, control of S. fuliginea might only be maintained by a form of integrated control, which accepts less than perfect disease control. Biological and chemical control, induced resistance of cucumber plants, epidermal coating and mildew-tolerant cucumber cultivars are elements that may fit into a strategy for integrated control of cucumber powdery mildew...|$|R
