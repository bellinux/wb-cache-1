5|$|Both {{the caps}} and the stems <b>contain</b> the psychoactive compounds, {{although}} the caps consistently <b>contain</b> more. The spores of these mushrooms do not <b>contain</b> psilocybin or psilocin. The total potency varies greatly between species and even between specimens {{of a species}} collected or grown from the same strain. Because most psilocybin biosynthesis occurs early {{in the formation of}} fruit bodies or sclerotia, younger, smaller mushrooms tend to have a higher concentration of the drug than larger, mature mushrooms. In general, the psilocybin content of mushrooms is quite variable (ranging from almost nothing to 1.5% of the dry weight) and depends on species, strain, growth and drying conditions, and mushroom size. Cultivated mushrooms have less variability in psilocybin content than wild mushrooms. The drug is more stable in dried than fresh mushrooms; dried mushrooms retain their potency for months or even years, while mushrooms stored fresh for four weeks <b>contain</b> only traces of the original psilocybin.|$|E

5|$|Group 3 is a {{group of}} {{elements}} in the periodic table. This group, like other d-block groups, should <b>contain</b> four elements, but it is not agreed what elements belong in the group. Scandium (Sc) and yttrium (Y) are always included, but the other two spaces are usually occupied by lanthanum (La) and actinium (Ac), or by lutetium (Lu) and lawrencium (Lr); less frequently, it is considered the group should be expanded to 32 elements (with all the lanthanides and actinides included) or contracted to <b>contain</b> only scandium and yttrium.

Besides, increase of MLSS does not affect costs of WWTP <b>containing</b> SBR, but increase of this value decreases the total project construction, material and amortization costs of WWTPs <b>containing</b> EAAS and CAS.
