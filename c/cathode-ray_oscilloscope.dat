Swiss {{journalist}} and author Peter Holenstein describes how this happened in his book on the lifework of co-founder Willi Studer: In June 1947, Emil Haefely, founder of the company Emil Haefely & Cie AG, {{which was one of}} Metrohm's first customers, asked Willi Studer, whom he had known for many years, to build a prototype for a <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>oscilloscope.</b> This being new technology for Metrohm, Bertold Suhner opposed the idea, fearing that the development wouldn't be possible within reasonable time and budget constraints. Indeed, while the development of the simpler instruments in Metrohm's portfolio had never taken Studer more than a few weeks, Studer still hadn't finished the prototype after several months at the end of November 1947. At this point, his colleague Suhner lost all hope that the project would come to a successful conclusion. A break between the co-founders was the result and led Studer to leave the company at the end of December 1947. From then on, Suhner ran the business by himself. Studer, on the other hand, went on to found his own company [...] "Willi Studer", known as Studer today and famous for its audio equipment.|$|E

The method has the advantages of a two-dimensional display of continuous variables, flexibility, speed, and relatively low cost. It lacks the advantage of a digital output. Figures show IRTs of pigeons on VI, FR, DRL and extinction, and transitions among these, and also the results of stimulus generalization tests.

40|$|In {{the design}} of the Vertical Velocity Meter a survey was first {{conducted}} of the existing methods used to measure the vertical velocity of an airplane when landing. A study was then made of these methods and of other unsuccessful attempts to design a Vertical Velocity Meter to determine just why they were not satisfactory and in what way they might be improved. It was decided to develop a design along an entirely different principle than any used before but yet one having basic simplicity. The one selected was based on the formula of velocity being equal to a distance divided by the time it took to travel that distance. To accomplish this a device was designed which consisted of two rods of different length which would strike the ground when the plane was landing, thus if the difference in length and the time between the striking of the two rods is known, the velocity at that moment would be determined. Since it was impracticable to test this device on an airplane, a testing machine was constructed which would test both the strength of the rods and various timing methods. This machine consisted of a wedge mounted {{on the end of a}} whirling arm which would strike the rods and simulate the impact received during the landing of an airplane. Two timing methods were tried; a Miller Oscillograph with built in recorder, and a <b>Cathode-Ray</b> <b>Oscilloscope</b> with a camera to record the trace. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{re-ignition}} characteristics (variation of {{re-ignition voltage}} with time after current zero) of short alternating current arcs between plane brass electrodes in air were studied by observing the average re-ignition voltages {{on the screen}} of a <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>oscilloscope</b> and controlling the rates of rise of voltage by varying the shunting capacitance and hence the natural period of oscillation of the reactors used to limit the current. The shape of these characteristics and the effects on them of varying the electrode separation, air pressure, and current strength were determined. The results show that short arc spaces recover dielectric strength in two distinct stages. The first stage agrees in shape and magnitude with a previously developed theory that all voltage is concentrated across a partially deionized space charge layer which increases its breakdown voltage with diminishing density of ionization in the field-tree space. The second stage appears to follow complete deionization by the electric field due to displacement of the field-free region by the space charge layer, its magnitude and shape appearing to be due simply to increase in gas density due to cooling. Temperatures calculated from this second stage and ion densities determined from the first stage {{by means of the}} space charge equation and an extrapolation of the temperature curve are consistent with recent measurements of arc value by other methods. Analysis or the decrease with time of the apparent ion density shows that diffusion alone is adequate to explain the results and that volume recombination is not. The effects on the characteristics of variations in the parameters investigated are found to be in accord with previous results and with the theory if deionization mainly by diffusion be assumed. </p...|$|E
40|$|IN {{recent years}} applied {{physiology}} {{has begun to}} play an important part in medical diagnosis. The object {{of this paper is to}} provide some base-line normal values for nerve conduction in three peripheral nerves—the ulnar, median, and lateral popliteal nerves—as these nerves are frequently the subject of conduc-tion tests. It has been well described by Weiss (1956) that when a nerve is constricted there is generalized thinning of the axon distal to the point of constriction. Conduction velocity in nerve is proportional to the calibre of the axon (Hodes et ah, 1948), and this proportionality is valid also for nerves after injury (Hursh, 1939). It therefore follows that, as the calibre of the axon decreases, so also does conduction velocity. Now that more modern techniques have been developed and concentric needle electrodes are standard equipment it is felt that a series of normal subjects should be examined, their conduction velocities and latencies recorded, and the artifacts encountered discussed. In previously published series skin electrodes (Hodes et ah, 1948; Norrise/a/., 1953) and coaxial needle electrodes (Thomas et ah, 1959) have been used to pick up the action potential from the activated muscles. MATERIALS AND METHODS Conduction velocity was measured in thirty medical and physiotherapy students on three nerves—the median, ulnar, and lateral popliteal. The equip-ment used was the standard electromyograph at St. Thomas's Hospital, London, designed and developed in the electronic section. A bipolar electrode consisting of two saline-soaked tufts 1 cm. in diameter and 2 cm. apart was supplied from a balanced constant-voltage stimulator delivering a rectangular pulse of 0 - 1 millisecond duration percutaneously. A concentric needle electrode was used to pick up the action potential from the muscle under study, and this was photographed synchronously from the <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>oscilloscope</b> on the electro-myograph.

40|$|The {{relative}} importance of vision, audition and olfaction to weasels and polecats was determined by training the predators to find a mouse located in a predator-proof container within a small arena. The diversity of sensory information available to the predators {{had an effect on}} the time taken to find the mouse with this being shorter when three senses could be used compared to when one sensory modality was available. Vision and olfaction (air-borne scent) were equivalent, with audition being less important. The mouse was found quicker using substrate-scent cues than with air-borne olfactory cues. There was no difference in the {{relative importance}} of the senses between the predators. The removal of movement cues had a significant effect on the behaviour of the weasels. The visual movement discrimination ability of both species was investigated using a horizontally-moving spot on a <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>oscilloscope</b> screen. Thresholds were determined for the discrimination of the direction of a fast-moving stimulus and were equivalent in the polecat and weasel. The mean threshold for polecats was 292 cms(^- 1) and for weasels was 267 cms(^- 1). The movement detection ability of the weasel was consistent over a range of stimulus radiant intensities (35. 4 - 2. 0 x 10 (^ 5) µWsteradian(^-l)) and discrimination distances (10 - 50 cm), although there was a slight decrease in threshold at the furthest distance used and when the distance traversed by the stimulus was short. A relative velocity discrimination task was devised in which polecats were trained to discriminate differences in speed between identical objects moving in opposite directions in the horizontal plane. They could detect velocity differences of 20 % and showed a tendency to select the slower-moving of the two stimuli. Polecats and weasels do not specialize in the use of a particular distance sense to locate potential prey. In terms of their movement detection ability and the {{relative importance of}} vision they are intermediate between strictly nocturnal and diurnal species, which is probably attributable to their predominately crepuscular activity pattern...|$|E
40|$|Machine {{learning}} {{methods are}} an excellent way for understanding the neural basis of human decision making. Some machine learning systems try to eradicate the need for human intuition in data analysis whereas others embrace a collective approach between humans and machines. The objective of this project is to collect Electroencephalography (EEG) signals through wireless sensors, and the process the collected signals through machine learning methods. The EEG data is collected using three EEG electrodes, each being the positive, negative and ground terminals respectively. Since the signal measures in the unit of micro-volts {{it needs to be}} amplified using amplifier circuit. This circuit consists of five stages, namely, the Instrumentation Amplifier, 60 Hz Notch Filter, 31 Hz Low Pass Filter, Gain Stage, and Clamper Circuit. Each of these stages contribute in their own way to amplify and also filter the noise from the EEG signal. The gain of the entire circuit is about 5140 V/V. The EEG signal is observed on the <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>oscilloscope</b> and the data is collected on an Arduino Uno microcontroller using the Hyperterminal software. The data is sampled at a sampling rate of 838 Hz. Any remaining noise from the signal can be removed by passing it through a digital low-pass filter, if required. EEG data is collected from 10 people while they are made to concentrate on a particular thought. The subjects were asked to imagine moving an object towards the direction 2 ̆ 6 lsquoRight 2 ̆ 6 rsquo for the first 150 data sets collected and then the same for the direction 2 ̆ 6 lsquoLeft 2 ̆ 6 rsquo for another 150 data sets.

This part of this data was then used to design a Machine Learning model called Support Vector Machine (SVM) on Matlab, using which the data was then processed. The data was divided into two sets, namely. The training data, and testing data. One-third of the total data sets is used for training the SVM model and then the rest of the data sets are used to test the accuracy of the model. Data from the 10 individuals is processed individually and also after being mixed. The SVM model randomly selects the training and testing data and accordingly gives results for the accuracy. Finally, results for the individual data and mixed data are tabulated and presented in the following thesis...|$|E
