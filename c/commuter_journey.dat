40|$|Parking {{in central}} {{business}} districts (CBD) is of considerable importance for sustainable transportation policy {{in terms of}} modal choice relative to transit use. This paper examines data for parking supply, demand and pricing. Interviews with municipal parking official were conducted for 22 Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs) across all provinces (except Quebec). There is a strong positive relationship between CMA population size and municipal parking rates. It is theorized that as CMA population grows land values in the CBD rise and the opportunity cost of parking space increases. As the higher cost of parking and limited supply of parking spaces (relative to demand) impact on parking price there is greater incentive {{for the private sector}} to provide more parking. Municipal off-street parking rates are negatively related to the percentage of CBD parking that is municipally provided and positively related to per worker parking availability in the CBD; and are positively related to transit ridership shares for <b>commuter</b> <b>journey</b> to work...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relative importance}} that people attach to various instrumental and affective journey attributes when travelling either for work or for a leisure day trip and presents how journeys by various travel modes score on these attributes. Although not a comparative paper, data are presented for two studies which used some identical measurements: one on <b>commuter</b> <b>journeys</b> and one on leisure journeys. The results show that for work journeys, respondents tend to attach more importance to instrumental aspects, and especially to convenience than to affective factors. For leisure journeys, however, respondents appear to attach almost equal importance to instrumental and affective aspects, particularly flexibility, convenience, relaxation, a sense of freedom and 'no stress'. Each study also examines (i) how regular users' evaluate their own mode and (ii) how car users perceive the performance of alternative modes compared to their importance ratings. This 'gap' analysis reveals on which modes and for which attributes the greatest deficiencies in performance lie. The data for both the work and leisure studies shows that for car users, alternative transport modes are inferior on the salient attributes such as convenience and flexibility even though car users rate modes such as walking and cycling as performing well, if not better, on less important attributes such as the environment, health and even excitement. Nevertheless, for those who cycle and walk regularly, satisfaction with their own travel mode {{as measured by the}} gap between importance and performance on salient attributes is better than for those who mostly use the car. Conclusions are made as to how greater attention to affective factors may improve our understanding of mode choice. ...|$|R

One part of the questionnaire focused on the determinants of cycling behavior including equal numbers of personal, social factors and environmental factors. The other component focused on assessing data on physical activity (PA) behavior. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were used to analyze factors associated with commuter cycling. Results Meeting the physical activity guideline was positively associated with commuter cycling. Television viewing and working full-time were negatively associated. Twenty-six percent of the participants met the PA guideline simply by cycling to work, with health as the main reason. The main barriers for non-cyclists (60 %) were perspiration when arriving at work, weather and travelling time. Shorter travelling times compared with other transportation modes were an important facilitator. Environmental factors were positively related to more frequent and more convenient commuter cycling, but they were hardly mentioned by non-cyclists. Conclusions This study shows that a relatively large group fulfils the PA recommendations merely by cycling to work.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} the personal exposure of cyclists and Underground train users in London to particulate matter below 5 ?m in diameter (PM 5) and provides {{evidence of the}} number, shape, size distribution and elemental composition of collected particles. Samples were analysed using computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy (CCSEM) and energy dispersive X-ray detection (EDX), including analysis of samples for low energy elements (carbon) by open window detection. Results were processed and classified using a custom written software package (MIDAS). A total of 33 938 particles were analysed for size and 12 568 particles were classified for size and elemental composition. Samples were also collected for gravimetric analysis. Thirty volunteers cycling commuter routes into central London were selected and monitored according to particulate matter for 1 week during November 1995 –February 1996. Samples were also collected by three commuters using London Underground during their daily <b>commuter</b> <b>journeys</b> as a comparison. Cassella personal sampling pumps fitted with cyclone heads incorporating filters were used to collect particles. Carbon particles are clearly the dominant particle type in the road traffic samples with mean particle fractions of 66 % carbon. The size distribution of the aerosol sampled by cyclists — high numbers of the smallest sized particles — is typical of vehicle emissions. Samples from the Underground show a distinctly different size distribution and elemental composition. Samples exhibited a higher loading of coarse mode particles with a more even distribution across the particle sizes collected. The most abundant particles in the Underground are Fe/Si-rich particles with 53 % (56 % in the 20 -kV range) {{of the total number}} of particles. The average Fe concentration in this particle class was 22. 8 % and the Si concentration 17. 4 % together with C, Ca and K. The particle mass concentration in the London Underground trains proved to be almost 10 times higher than those measured by cyclists in traffic generated aerosol. <br/...|$|R

The models are implemented in a custom C# application and are capable of providing key parametric information of the simulated journey and individual energy drive components. A typical <b>commuter</b> return <b>journey</b> between Stratford Upon Avon and Birmingham is investigated. The fuel cell stack and battery pack behaviour is assessed for different stack sizes, battery sizes and control strategies to evaluate the performance of the overall system with the aim of understanding the optimum component configuration.
