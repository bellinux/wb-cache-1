50|$|The civil {{jurisdiction}} of the Circuit court {{is limited to a}} compensation claim not exceeding €75,000 (€60,000 if a claim for damages for personal injuries) and for actions involving real property with a rateable value of less than €254, although the parties in a legal action can agree to lifting these limits by agreeing to unlimited jurisdiction. Divorce and judicial separation, and <b>contentious</b> <b>probate</b> cases can also be heard provided that the value of any real property in a settlement is within the {{jurisdiction of the}} court. Unlike the District Court and in common with the High Court, the Circuit Court has equitable jurisdiction in relation to claims involving land, but matters in which injunctions and declarations are sought not involving land must be brought in the High Court.|$|E
