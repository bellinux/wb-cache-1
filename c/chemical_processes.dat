40|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>process</b> route {{selection}} {{is one of}} the main design decisions that needs to be taken during the preliminary stages of chemical plant design and development. A <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> route is considered as the raw materials and the sequence of reaction steps that converts them in to desired products. Previously, the most important factor considered in selecting the <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> route was plant economics. However, now other issues such as safety, environment and occupational health have also become important considerations. Therefore, at early stages of <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> plant design and development it is necessary to apply methodologies to identify and assess environmental, occupational health and safety hazards involved in the process routes. This work proposes a methodology for assessing <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> routes to manufacture a chemical based on inherent environmental, occupational health and safety hazards. The method developed in this work can be used during early design stages of a <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> plant. The process {{route selection}} is done based on impacts due to emissions from the ongoing operational conditions of the plant. It considers the potential toxicological impacts on the environment, potential impacts on the occupational health due to fugitive emissions and the potential <b>chemical</b> and <b>process</b> safety impacts within the plant. As the outcome of the methodology, an integrated index called “Inherent <b>Chemical</b> <b>Process</b> Route Index” (ICPRI) is proposed which can be used for the selection of the ‘best’ <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> route for a <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> plant, based on inherent environmental hazard, occupational health and safety (IEHS). The lower the ICPRI the more inherently environmentally friendly, inherently occupational healthier and inherently safer the route is. The methodology developed in this work can also rank alternative <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> routes based on inherent environmental hazard or occupational health hazard and or safety hazard separately. The method was applied on four possible process routes to produce acetone. The propene oxidation route showed the lowest ICPRI value indicating potentially the ‘best’ <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> route for acetone manufacturing process based on the IEHS assessment.

5|$|The {{positive}} charge in ions {{is achieved by}} stripping away electrons from atomic nuclei. The number of electrons removed is related to either the increase in temperature or the local density of other ionised matter. This also can be accompanied by the dissociation of molecular bonds, though this process is distinctly different from <b>chemical</b> <b>processes</b> of ion interactions in liquids or the behavior of ions existing in metals. The response of plasma to electromagnetic fields can be usefully employed in many modern technological devices, such as plasma televisions or plasma etching.|$|E
5|$|Solar <b>{{chemical}}</b> <b>processes</b> use {{solar energy}} to drive chemical reactions. These processes offset energy {{that would otherwise}} come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into storable and transportable fuels. Solar induced chemical reactions {{can be divided into}} thermochemical or photochemical. A variety of fuels can be produced by artificial photosynthesis. The multielectron catalytic chemistry involved in making carbon-based fuels (such as methanol) from reduction of carbon dioxide is challenging; a feasible alternative is hydrogen production from protons, though use of water as the source of electrons (as plants do) requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two water molecules to molecular oxygen. Some have envisaged working solar fuel plants in coastal metropolitan areas by 2050 the splitting of sea water providing hydrogen to be run through adjacent fuel-cell electric power plants and the pure water by-product going directly into the municipal water system. Another vision involves all human structures covering the earth's surface (i.e., roads, vehicles and buildings) doing photosynthesis more efficiently than plants.|$|E

5|$|The {{aging of}} high quality red wine {{required}} specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive end product. Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation {{must have been a}} widespread problem. Even if vinegar was a common ingredient, there was only so much of it that could be used. In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees of white wine were both effective bactericides, even if the <b>chemical</b> <b>processes</b> were not understood at the time. Spiced or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent, but was also considered especially healthy by physicians. Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body, and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome. Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary (red) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger, cardamom, pepper, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cloves and sugar. These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and claré. By the 14th century, bagged spice mixes could be bought ready-made from spice merchants.|$|E
5|$|Food {{preservation}} methods were {{basically the same}} as had been used since antiquity, and did not change much until the invention of canning in the early 19th century. The most common and simplest method was to expose foodstuffs to heat or wind to remove moisture, thereby prolonging the durability if not the flavor of almost any type of food from cereals to meats; the drying of food worked by drastically reducing the activity of various water-dependent microorganisms that cause decay. In warm climates this was mostly achieved by leaving food out in the sun, and in the cooler northern climates by exposure to strong winds (especially common for the preparation of stockfish), or in warm ovens, cellars, attics, and at times even in living quarters. Subjecting food {{to a number of}} <b>chemical</b> <b>processes</b> such as smoking, salting, brining, conserving or fermenting also made it keep longer. Most of these methods had the advantage of shorter preparation times and of introducing new flavors. Smoking or salting meat of livestock butchered in autumn was a common household strategy to avoid having to feed more animals than necessary during the lean winter months. Butter tended to be heavily salted (5–10%) in order not to spoil. Vegetables, eggs or fish were also often pickled in tightly packed jars, containing brine and acidic liquids (lemon juice, verjuice or vinegar). Another method was to seal the food by cooking it in sugar or honey or fat, in which it was then stored. Microbial modification was also encouraged, however, by a number of methods; grains, fruit and grapes were turned into alcoholic drinks thus killing any pathogens, and milk was fermented and curdled into a multitude of cheeses or buttermilk.|$|E
