50|$|On 9 July 1789, {{before the}} threat of a {{combined}} might of Britain and Prussia, Denmark agreed to <b>cease</b> active <b>engagement</b> in the conflict. A statement of neutrality was issued by Denmark, not a formal peace treaty.|$|R
50|$|Though {{she still}} makes {{appearances}} with the Mouseketeers, Baird gradually <b>ceased</b> doing professional <b>engagements</b> in the 1990s. She relocated from Southern California to Reno, Nevada {{about the same}} time, where she lives in semi-retirement.|$|R
60|$|The Colonel, to whom Clive communicated, {{though with}} us the poor lad held his tongue, {{told my wife}} what had happened:--not all the battles; which no doubt raged at breakfast, dinner, supper, {{during the week of}} Clive's visit to Boulogne,--but the upshot of these engagements. Rosey, not unwilling in her first private talk with her husband to come to England with him and the boy, showed herself irresolute on the second day at breakfast, when the fire was opened on both sides; cried at dinner when fierce assaults took place, in which Clive had the advantage; slept soundly, but besought him to be very firm, and met the enemy at breakfast with a quaking heart; cried all that day during which, pretty well without <b>cease,</b> the <b>engagement</b> lasted; and when Clive might have conquered and brought her off, but the weather was windy and the sea was rough, and he was {{pronounced}} a brute to venture on it with a wife in Rosey's situation.|$|R
40|$|Why, despite clear {{economic}} incentives, did eighteenth-century slave traders fail {{to defend}} their business interests against the abolition campaign? We focus on the outport of Bristol as a case in point. Our main argument is that slave traders lacked an organizational basis to translate their economic interests into political influence. Supporting evidence from merchant networks over the 1698 – 1807 period shows that the Society of Merchant Venturers offered such an organizational site for collective political action. Members of this chartered company controlled much of Bristol’s seaborne commerce and held chief elective offices in the municipal government. However, the Society evolved into an organization that represented the interests of a closed elite. High barriers to entry prevented the slave traders from using the Society {{as a vehicle for}} political mobilization. Social cohesion among slave traders outside the chartered company hinged on centrally positioned brokers. Yet the broker positions were held by the few merchants who became members of the Society, and who eventually <b>ceased</b> their <b>engagement</b> in slave trading. The result was a fragmented network that undermined the slave traders’ concerted efforts to mobilize against the political pressure of the abolitionist movement...|$|R
2500|$|The Confederate Navy's attack {{began on}} the night of January 23 of 1865. Commodore Mitchell lifted anchor at Chaffin's Bluff just after sunset, his first task would be to sneak by the Union battery on Signal Hill and Fort Brady in the darkness. Colonel Pierce {{reported}} that at 8:00 pm one of his lookouts on the fort's parapet spotted the three rebel ironclads {{and a few of the}} other vessels moving down the river so immediately Pierce ordered his gunners to begin firing. The first shot of the battle was from a [...] "heavy gun" [...] mounted in the fort, it was followed by additional rounds from the battery. Due to the [...] "mal-construction" [...] of Fort Brady, as Pierce said, the artillery could not be fired down river so not long after the rebels were spotted they were out of range of the Union guns and thus slipped by apparently without damage or casualties. Some twenty-five rounds were discharged by the federal gunners in this first action. After getting past the fort, Commodore Mitchell continued on for the naval mine field at Trent's Reach. Meanwhile, two Confederate batteries, consisting of at least sixteen cannon, opened up on Pierce's position and continued to bombard it throughout the night. The Union garrison returned fire and in the exchange one 100-pounder in the fort was destroyed though Colonel Pierce reported having dislodged two rebel pieces before receiving orders to <b>cease</b> the <b>engagement.</b>|$|R
50|$|After the Chaos Temple falls, {{the warp}} begins {{to tear the}} planet asunder which forces them to make an {{immediate}} evacuation. Araghast allows the Force Commander and his strike force to escape, and tells Eliphas that his vengeance can wait. Aboard the Retribution, a recording was found that implicates a traitor within the Chapter who gave Araghast's forces the transmitting codes {{that were used to}} ambush the Blood Ravens when they first arrived on Aurelia. The Blood Ravens then return to Meridian to aid the 85th Vendoland in recapturing Spire Legis. With the help of Sergeant Thaddeus (who requested to be on the mission, originally hailing from that region), they successfully weaken the Chaos and Heretic forces holding the area. They also destroy an Eldar strike force that was uncovering ancient ruins on Typhon with Sergeant Tarkus. After dispatching numerous problems, Space Marine Scouts on Calderis send out a distress call that they have been engaged by a substantial number of Chaos forces. With the help of Sergeant Cyrus, they save the initiates from certain death and kill a Chaos Sorcerer operating in the area. Soon after, a contingent of the Blood Ravens Honor Guard, led by Captain Apollo Diomedes, arrives. Diomedes, acting on behalf of the Blood Ravens' Chapter Master and Chief Librarian, Azariah Kyras, orders all Blood Ravens to <b>cease</b> all <b>engagements</b> with the Black Legion forces and return to their ships until further ordered.|$|R

40|$|In {{an essay}} first {{published}} in 1959, Roland Barthes declared that modern literature had become “a mask pointing to itself ”. 1 Barthes described this self-reflexivity as an anxious, even tragic condition, a tortured process in which literature divides itself into the two logically distinct, yet inter-related levels of object-language and meta-language. Asking itself continually the single, self-absorbing question of its own identity, literature becomes a meta-language and thereby ceases to be an object-language capable of depicting or describing anything other than itself. “It follows”, Barthes proclaims, that “for over one hundred years our literature has played a dangerous game with its own death, or in other words, with a manner of living through its own death”. Barthes conjectures in passing that this perpetual self-questioning began with the bourgeoisie’s loss of its bonne conscience. Literature’s self-reflexive turn {{has resulted in a}} variety of fascinating writerly strategies, but has also had the global effect of precluding the emergence of a literature of action and <b>engagement.</b> <b>Ceasing</b> to ask: ‘What is to be done?’, the artist can only utter the words: ‘Who am I?...|$|R

40|$|Auditor-General’s {{comments}} In February 2015 I released {{my first}} audit {{following up on}} audit recommendations from 2012 – 13. The inaugural report {{was the basis for}} further follow-up audits to verify the information agencies provided. This report, focusing on the Department of Education and Training (DET) and WorkSafe, is the third in a series of follow-up reports that I intend to release this financial year. It provides Parliament and the community with information about improvements that DET and WorkSafe may have made in relation to my recommendations. The 2013 audit Management of Staff Occupational Health and Safety in Schools identified weakness in systems and processes, resulting in our conclusion that DET did not hold schools to account for occupational health and safety (OHS) performance and had missed opportunities to learn from other sectors and improve schools 2 ̆ 7 performance. We also found that WorkSafe could not demonstrate the impact of its workplace projects to address OHS issues in schools and had <b>ceased</b> regular <b>engagement</b> with DET. A total of nine recommendations were made with the aim of addressing the issues. I commend both agencies for the actions they have taken to address the recommendations and underlying issues. Efforts have demonstrated a commitment to identifying more meaningful ways of implementing our recommendations. In the context of DET being the largest employer in Victoria, it is positive that it is taking steps to improve its oversight of schools 2 ̆ 7 OHS management and compliance. This is complemented by improved return to work processes assisting injured employees to return to work earlier. As the regulator, one of WorkSafe 2 ̆ 7 s responsibilities is to improve workplace safety. Developing and implementing an agency-wide evaluation framework will allow it to demonstrate the effectiveness of its programs to address OHS risks in the workplace...|$|R
60|$|They {{knew not}} each other's opinion, either its {{constancy}} or its change, {{on the one}} leading point of Anne's conduct, for the subject was never alluded to; but Anne, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differently from {{what she had been}} made to think at nineteen. She did not blame Lady Russell, she did not blame herself for having been guided by her; but she felt that were any young person, in similar circumstances, to apply to her for counsel, they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good. She was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home, and every anxiety attending his profession, all their probable fears, delays, and disappointments, she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement, than she had been in the sacrifice of it; and this, she fully believed, had the usual share, had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs, without reference to the actual results of their case, which, as it happened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on. All his sanguine expectations, all his confidence had been justified. His genius and ardour had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path. He had, very soon after their <b>engagement</b> <b>ceased,</b> got employ: and all that he had told her would follow, had taken place. He had distinguished himself, and early gained the other step in rank, and must now, by successive captures, have made a handsome fortune. She had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority, but she could not doubt his being rich; and, in favour of his constancy, she had no reason to believe him married.|$|R
50|$|The then Georgian {{president}} Mikheil Saakashvili {{ordered a}} general ceasefire on August 10 effectively halting all Georgian military operations while the Russian forces continued moving against any opposition. By {{the end of}} 11 August South Ossetia was completely cleared of Georgian forces. During the withdrawal, the Georgian 4th Mechanised Infantry Brigade was bombarded by Russian aircraft and the unit suffered heavy casualties. Small isolated Georgian units continued resistance. The Russian advance was briefly halted near the villages of Zemo-Nikozi and Shindisi losing a T-72B with its entire crew and a BMD-1 to retreating Georgian infantry elements, but continued after Chechen units cleared Zemo-Nikosi. A controversial engagement {{took place in the}} village of Shindisi which was being occupied by Russian forces when a Georgian Sapper convoy of the 2nd Light Infantry Brigade was allowed to pass the village as major <b>engagements</b> <b>ceased</b> at that point. The lightly armed unit was transported with Landrovers and trucks. In what is being described as either confusion or calculated move by the Georgian side, the Engineer group got attacked as soon as it reached an abandoned railway station. All vehicles got destroyed and 17 Georgian soldiers killed during the fight, while 5 servicemen partially wounded managed to escape and were sheltered and nursed by the local residents who hid them from the Russian army. According to Russian accounts, the convoy was attacked when it passed a damaged BMD-1 unit unaware of its presence and the Russian soldiers reacted by attacking it losing no man in the process. Later that day the local Georgian priests requested to retrieve the dead soldiers bodies which was initially denied but shortly after granted by the Russian commander in charge.|$|R
