50|$|One of the {{hallmark}} features of Trichomonas vaginalis is the adherence factors that allow <b>cervicovaginal</b> epithelium colonization in women.

The adhesins are four trichomonad enzymes called AP65, AP51, AP33, and AP23 that mediate the interaction of the parasite to the receptor molecules on VECs. Cysteine proteinases may be another virulence factor because not only do these 30 kDa proteins bind to host cell surfaces but also may degrade extracellular matrix proteins like hemoglobin, fibronectin or collagen IV.|$|E
5000|$|Production of {{hydrogen}} peroxide (H2O2) {{is a well-known}} mechanism for bacterial antagonism, inhibiting growth of microorganisms via direct interaction or via human myeloperoxidase. Hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli {{have been shown to}} inactivate HIV-1, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), Trichomonas vaginalis, G. vaginalis, P. bivia and E. coli. O'Hanlon and Baeten found that 96% of Lactobacillus species from a healthy vaginal ecosystem produced H2O2 (L. jensenii and L. vaginalis produce the highest levels of H2O2), whereas only 6% of the lactobacilli recovered from women with BV produced H2O2. In agreement with this, L. iners, most frequently associated with disturbed vaginal microflora, is a poor producer of H2O2. Vaginal colonization by H2O2-producing lactobacilli has been associated with a decrease in the occurrence of bacterial vaginosis (BV). However, more recently O‘Hanlon et al. demonstrated that <b>cervicovaginal</b> fluid and semen have a significant H2O2-blocking activity and they later [...] demonstrated that physiological concentrations of H2O2 below 100 μMfail to inactivate any of the 17 tested BV-associated bacteria, e.g. A. vaginae, G. vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp., P. bivia, Prevotella corporis, Mycoplasma hominis, even in the presence ofhuman myeloperoxidase, known to increase the microbicidal activity of H2O2. Only supraphysiologic concentrations of exogenous H2O2 (0.34% w/v, 100 mM) were sufficient to inactivate BV-associated bacteria at which concentration it more potently inactivated vaginal lactobacilli (L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. iners and L. jensenii). A concentration of 100 mM H2O2 is approximately 50-fold higher than lactobacilli are capable of producing even under optimal aerobic, low-antioxidant conditions, and approximately 5,000-fold higher than the estimated H2O2 concentration in vivo. Even more remarkable, the addition of only 1% vaginal fluid blocked the microbicidal activity of 1 M H2O2. Possible explanations may be that <b>cervicovaginal</b> fluid and semen contain proteins, glycoproteins, polysaccharides, lipids, and other molecules with the potential to react with and inactivate H2O2. In addition, the vagina is hypoxic most of the time, whereas lactobacilli require oxygen to produce hydrogen peroxide. It is also remarkable that catalase, which provides bacteria protection against toxic H2O2, is absent in lactobacilli, and as such they would be unprotected against their own H2O2 production. In contrast, under optimal anaerobic growth conditions, physiological concentrations of lactic acid inactivated the BV-associated pathogens without affecting the vaginal lactobacilli. In summary, although the hydrogen peroxide production of lactobacilli has been considered as an important antimicrobial component, contributing to the colonization resistance provided by lactobacilli, and although {{there seems to be a}} link between H2O2-producing lactobacilli and normal vaginal microflora, recent data do not support this role for H2O2.|$|E
40|$|Women {{exposed to}} {{diethylstilbestrol}} (DES) in utero develop abnormalities, including <b>cervicovaginal</b> adenosis {{that can lead}} to cancer. We report that transient disruption of developmental signals by DES permanently changes expression of p 63, thereby altering the developmental fate of Mullerian duct epithelium. The cell fate of Mullerian epithelium to be columnar (uterine) or squamous (<b>cervicovaginal)</b> is determined by mesenchymal induction during the perinatal period. <b>Cervicovaginal</b> mesenchyme induced p 63 in Mullerian duct epithelium and subsequent squamous differentiation. In p 63 (-/-) mice, <b>cervicovaginal</b> epithelium differentiated into uterine epithelium. Thus, p 63 is an identity switch for Mullerian duct epithelium to be <b>cervicovaginal</b> versus uterine.

Analysis of the <b>cervicovaginal</b> fluid proteome may therefore yield important information about the pathogenesis of numerous gynecological pathologies. Additionally, <b>cervicovaginal</b> fluid has great potential {{as a source of}} biomarkers for these conditions. This review provides a detailed discussion about the human <b>cervicovaginal</b> proteome and the proteomics studies performed to characterize this biological fluid. Furthermore, infection-correlated pathological conditions of the female genital tract are discussed for which <b>cervicovaginal</b> fluid has been used in order to identify potential biomarkers.

40|$|Not {{the final}} {{published}} versionOBJECTIVE: To detect anti-HIV antibodies in <b>cervicovaginal</b> secretions of HIV-seronegative female sex workers and {{to evaluate whether}} {{the presence of these}} antibodies is associated with increased sexual exposure. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out at a confidential clinic for female sex workers in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. The participants were 342 HIV-seronegative female sex workers in whom a <b>cervicovaginal</b> lavage was collected. The main outcome measures were the detection of antibodies to HIV- 1 in <b>cervicovaginal</b> lavages using an in-house and a commercial (Seradyn Sentinel; Calypte Biomedical Corporation, Berkeley, California, USA) enzyme immunoassay; the detection of semen in <b>cervicovaginal</b> lavages; and the assessment of epidemiological and biological markers of sexual exposure to HIV. RESULTS: <b>Cervicovaginal</b> anti-HIV antibodies were detected in 7. 3 and 29. 8 % of women using in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Seradyn Sentinel respectively. All <b>cervicovaginal</b> secretions found to be positive by in-house ELISA were also positive by Seradyn Sentinel. In a minority of women, ranging from 2. 9 % by in-house ELISA to 12. 3 % by Seradyn Sentinel, the anti-HIV antibodies were present in vaginal fluids that did not contain semen. Sexual exposure to HIV was similar in women with anti-HIV antibodies in their semen-free <b>cervicovaginal</b> secretions compared with women without anti-HIV antibodies in their <b>cervicovaginal</b> secretions. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Cervicovaginal</b> HIV-specific antibodies were detected in a minority of sexually exposed HIV-seronegative female sex workers in Abidjan.

Before douching, semen components were found in 46 of 56 CVS (82 %). The mean vaginal pH was 5. 2 (range, 3. 6 to 7. 7), and concentrations of both PAP and PSA correlated positively and strongly with <b>cervicovaginal</b> pH (P < 0. 001). After douching, semen components were found in 35 of 56 CVS (62 %) (P = 0. 03). <b>Cervicovaginal</b> PAP and PSA levels were significantly decreased (respectively, P < 0. 0001 and P < 0. 01; PAP, - 72 %; PSA, - 87 %), as was the total cell count (- 60 %; P < 0. 0001). Furthermore, in CVS previously positive for both PAP and PSA, the mean vaginal pH was significantly decreased (6. 5 versus 5. 3, P < 0. 01); no genital bleeding was observed.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} diagnostic value of <b>cervicovaginal</b> ferretin and serum ferretin levels at midgestation time in predicting preterm delivery in singleton pregnancies. Patients and Methods: A diagnostic test study through a prospective cohort design was carried out on 300 singleton pregnant women in 2012. A blood sample was obtained from all the patients within 22 - 24 gestational weeks for laboratory assessment of serum ferretin, and <b>cervicovaginal</b> sample was also taken to assess <b>cervicovaginal</b> ferritin level. Ferritin levels were compared between term and preterm deliveries at 37, 34 and 32 weeks of gestation. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were plotted to assess the diagnostic test values. Results: Mean serum ferritin level was 55. 38 [standard deviation (SD 23. 8) ] ng/mL in term deliveries versus a mean of 91. 27 (SD 25. 2) ng/mL in preterm deliveries, which showed a statistically significant difference (P < 0. 001). The ferritin levels in <b>cervicovaginal</b> term delivery group had mean of 11. 29 (SD 16. 2) ng/mL compared with a mean of 21. 95 (SD 10. 1) ng/mL among those with preterm delivery before 37 weeks of gestational age(P < 0. 001). The <b>cervicovaginal</b> ferritin level had a moderate to good diagnostic value with an area under curve being above 0. 8 for all assessments. The serum ferritin level had a moderate to good diagnostic value with an area under curve being above 0. 8 for all assessments.

40|$|Introital {{colonization}} with Enterobacteriaceae {{is considered}} {{to be one of the}} principal predisposing factors to recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI) in adult females. One proposed mechanism allowing introital colonization in these patients is the absence of local <b>cervicovaginal</b> antibody. To test this hypothesis, we examined <b>cervicovaginal</b> washings from 22 patients with a history of recurrent UTI and 29 normal controls with no history of UTI for specific local antibody by using indirect immunofluorescence.

Fourteen percent (3 / 22) of the patients had antibody to their introital Escherichia coli and 34 % (10 / 29) of the controls had antibody to their fecal E. coli.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} beta-human corionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) {{levels in}} <b>cervicovaginal</b> secretions {{as an early}} marker for preterm delivery. Methods: The study included 55 patients at 25 - 36 of gestational weeks with preterm delivery risk factors including a history of preterm labor in a previous pregnancy or history of second trimester abortion. Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) levels of <b>cervicovaginal</b> secretions were measured in all patients by the radioimmunoassay method using a commercial kit. Results: Preterm delivery was observed in 25 patients and 30 patients gave term delivery. No {{significant differences were found}} between preterm and term delivery groups in age, gravidity and parity (P> 0. 05). APGAR scores and anthropometric measurements of newborns were significantly lower in preterm delivery group (P< 0. 001). Preterm delivery group had significantly higher <b>cervicovaginal</b> β-hCG levels compared with normal controls (94. 7 ± 37. 7 vs. 35. 5 ± 14. 8 mIU/ml, respectively, P< 0. 001). When 75 mIU/ml value of β-hCG level was taken as cut-off value; the sensitivity of the test was found as 76 %, specifity 91. 6 %, positive predictive value 95. 0 % and negative predictive value as 79. 9 %. Conclusion: Concentrations of β-hCG in <b>cervicovaginal</b> secretions may be a useful early biochemical marker to detect preterm. Based on β-hCG levels in <b>cervicovaginal</b> secretions a closer follow-up may decrease some complications of preterm delivery. J Clin Exp Invest 2010; 1 (1) : 16 - 2...|$|E
40|$|Rare {{simultaneous}} {{occurrence of}} vaginal superficial <b>cervicovaginal</b> myofibroblastoma and vaginal stromal polyp is described. The lesions {{were found in}} a 90 -years-old patient, in the anterior wall of the vagina. The diameter of the lesions was 6 cm and 2 cm, respectively. Between them, a 3 cm part of normal appearing vaginal wall was present. Both lesions showed similar myoid appearing morphology and myofibroblastic desmin+/actin-/h-caldesmon-/CD 34 - immunophenotype, with positivity for CD 10, CD 99, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor. Larger lesion was diagnosed as benign <b>cervicovaginal</b> myofibroblastoma, and the smaller one had typical features of vaginal stromal polyp. This case of simultaneous occurrence of <b>cervicovaginal</b> myofibroblastoma and vaginal stromal polyp supports previously suggested histogenetic relationship between these lesions.

40|$|Two commercially {{available}} hypersensitive assays for {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) RNA quantitation, AMPLICOR HIV- 1 Monitor Test 1. 5 and Quantiplex HIV RNA 3. 0, were compared to detect and quantify HIV- 1 RNA in the cell-free fraction of <b>cervicovaginal</b> secretions collected by vaginal washing. Three panel specimens were used: pooled <b>cervicovaginal</b> secretions spiked with HIV- 1 subtype A or HIV- 1 subtype B and <b>cervicovaginal</b> lavages from HIV-positive and HIV-negative women. Compared to the AMPLICOR HIV- 1 Monitor Test 1. 5 assay, the Quantiplex HIV- 1 3. 0 assay yielded higher estimates of HIV- 1 RNA concentrations in several tested samples spiked with HIV- 1 RNA subtype A, as well as subtype B, particularly samples containing low amounts of HIV- 1 RNA. The sensitivity and specificity of the AMPLICOR HIV- 1 Monitor Test 1. 5 assay were 93 and 100 %, respectively; the sensitivity and specificity of the Quantiplex HIV RNA 3. 0 assay were 97 and 50 %, respectively. In conclusion, in quantifying HIV- 1 RNA in <b>cervicovaginal</b> secretions, the Quantiplex HIV RNA 3. 0 may lack specificity, and the AMPLICOR HIV- 1 Monitor Test 1. 5 assay, although highly specific, may lack sensitivity...|$|E
