5|$|Courses on {{this subject}} have grown {{significantly}} in the last <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>decades.</b> Teaching accountants about ethics can involve role playing, lectures, case studies, guest lectures, {{as well as other}} mediums. Recent studies indicate that nearly all accounting textbooks touch on ethics in some way. In 1993, the first United States center that focused on the study of ethics in the accounting profession opened at Binghamton University. Starting in 1999, several U.S. states began requiring ethics classes prior to taking the CPA exam.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{distributional}} and e ciency impacts of climate {{policy in the}} context of fiscal consolidation in a dynamic general-equilibrium overlapping generations model of the US economy. The model includes a disaggregated production structure, including energy sector detail and advanced low- or zero-carbon energy technologies, and detail on government taxes and spending. In contrast to revenue-neutral carbon tax swaps, using the carbon revenue for deficit reduction implies a relaxation of future public budgets as debt repayment results in lower interest obligations. While we show that the intergenerational welfare impacts depend importantly on what tax recycling instrument is used, we find that combining debt consolidation with a carbon policy entails the possibility of sustained welfare gains for future generations. We thus argue that combining fiscal and climate policy may o er the chance for positive societal gains (without considering potential benefits from averted climate change). Importantly, this may enhance the political support for revenue-raising climate policies that are framed over the next <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> <b>decades...</b>|$|R

The sequentially co-localized GOX and SHRP on B/C-PS nanoparticles were capable of enhancing the overall conversion rate by approximately two-fold compared to the equivalent concentration of free enzymes in solution.
