40|$|Cognitive {{function}} of music, its origin, and evolution {{has been a}} mystery until recently. Here we discuss a theory of a fundamental {{function of}} music in cognition and culture. Music evolved in parallel with language. The evolution of language toward a semantically powerful tool required freeing from uncontrolled emotions. Knowledge evolved fast along with language. This created <b>cognitive</b> <b>dissonances,</b> contradictions among knowledge and instincts, which differentiated consciousness. To sustain evolution of language and culture, these contradictions had to be unified. Music was the mechanism of unification. Differentiated emotions are needed for resolving <b>cognitive</b> <b>dissonances.</b> As knowledge has been accumulated, contradictions multiplied and correspondingly more varied emotions had to evolve. While language differentiated psyche, music unified it. Thus the need for refined musical emotions {{in the process of}} cultural evolution is grounded in fundamental mechanisms of cognition. This is why today's human mind and cultures cannot exist without today's music...|$|R

30|$|Theory The constructivist view of {{learning}} assumes that students build their conceptual understanding not by repeating instructed knowledge, but by interactively relating prior experience and knowledge to new concepts. According to Piaget’s theory of {{cognitive and affective}} development (1929, 1970), individuals seek to incorporate new concepts into existing schemata (i.e., assimilation) or to reframe existing schemata to fit new concepts (i.e., accommodation) {{in order to avoid}} <b>cognitive</b> <b>dissonances</b> that cause unease. Thus, it is fundamental to educational instruction (1) to explicitly discuss the relations between a new concept being taught and others that have already been taught and (2) to explicitly show the relations between elements (with which students should be familiar) within the concept, in order to make new concepts accessible. Furthermore, Vygotskij’s (1978) theory of the zone of proximal development postulates that learning takes place when learners “are always being challenged to increase their understanding of the problem while never being asked to do more than they can do” (Berndt 1997, p. 323). Therefore, tasks and exercises need to be constructed such that they address prior knowledge and competencies.|$|R

Education policy does not have to ignore localities and particular values, as well. But it must not submit the conflicts of identities which is rising in the recent period.

40|$|Conscious and {{unconscious}} brain mechanisms, including cognition, emotions and language are considered in this review. The fundamental mechanisms of cognition include interactions between bottom-up and top-down signals. The modeling of these interactions since the 1960 s is briefly reviewed, analyzing the ubiquitous difficulty: incomputable combinatorial complexity (CC). Fundamental reasons for CC {{are related to}} the Gödel’s difficulties of logic, a most fundamental mathematical result of the 20 th century. Many scientists still “believed” in logic because, as the review discusses, logic is related to consciousness; non-logical processes in the brain are unconscious. CC difficulty is overcome in the brain by processes “from vague-unconscious to crisp-conscious” (representations, plans, models, concepts). These processes are modeled by dynamic logic, evolving from vague {{and unconscious}} representations toward crisp and conscious thoughts. We discuss experimental proofs and relate dynamic logic to simulators of the perceptual symbol system. “From vague to crisp” explains interactions between cognition and language. Language is mostly conscious, whereas cognition is only rarely so; this clarifies much about the mind that might seem mysterious. All of the above involve emotions of a special kind, aesthetic emotions related to knowledge and to <b>cognitive</b> <b>dissonances.</b> Cognition-language-emotional mechanisms operate throughout the hierarchy of the mind and create all higher mental abilities.

25|$|Festinger’s other {{well-known}} {{theory of}} <b>cognitive</b> <b>dissonance,</b> proposed in 1957 offers further evidence for {{why such a}} process might occur. Because emotional experiences are unexpected, they can affect one’s self-concept and thus challenge one’s system of beliefs. According to Festinger, when people’s expectations do not manifest themselves, a <b>cognitive</b> <b>dissonance</b> is created between the expectations and reality and people seek to reduce this dissonance by rationalizing the discrepancy. So after experiencing an emotion, people {{would be expected to}} communicate the event with others in order to help reduce their <b>cognitive</b> <b>dissonance.</b> An article by Thoits emphasizes the importance of the ability of others to assist in the process of coping. Other people are able to offer new perspectives on interpretations of the emotional event. In previous studies, Rimé concluded that emotions necessitate “cognitive articulation” because of their dense, complex nature. By using language to express an experience, people are forced to classify and organize the contents of the emotions, and furthermore can concretize and objectivize the experience into a script that can be more easily understood.|$|E
25|$|The results {{reported}} in The Origins of Cognitive Dissonance: Evidence from Children and Monkeys (2007) {{indicated that there}} might be evolutionary force behind the reduction of <b>cognitive</b> <b>dissonance</b> in the actions of pre-school-age children and Capuchin monkeys when offered a choice between two like options, decals and candies. The groups then were offered a new choice, between the choice-object not chosen and a novel choice-object that was as attractive as the first object.

40|$|International audienceRegarding {{environmental}} issues, conflictuality is {{a privileged}} {{way to reach}} the political arena. "Naming, Blaming, Claiming": three steps that make the controversy emerge, constitute the public issue, then {{bring it to the}} politi- cal agenda. These three stages are clearly identifiable in the history of night protection associative movements. These movements emerged in the 1970 's in the United States of America, quickly disseminated enjoying a broader context of environmental thinking. Conflicts related to artificial lighting are structurally akin to conflicts of contradictory uses of a single resource: the night. For some - the technicists -, the night is the "good-support" for a specific economic activity and its technologies: urban lighting. For others - the environmentalists -, the "dark night" constitutes an ecosystemic service, which notably allows access to a specific resource: the starry sky. The study of the regimes of justification of the actors of conflicts shows that strong territorial disjunctions and <b>cognitive</b> <b>dissonances</b> make the dialogue difficult between the different "worlds" involved. The night is a pure collective good, a total public good, irreducible, non-rival, non-excludable, non-appropriable and unbargainable. It therefore falls to the public authority and its "legitimate violence" to support its protection. In France, the State initiative named "Grenelle de l'Environnement" has enabled consideration of controversies related to artificial lighting by the positive law. Various laws and planning tools encourage territories to reconsider their public lighting, or to promote the darkness of the night as a new territorial and/or touristic resource. We place our paper at the intersection between economics, geography and sociology of public territorial action. It aims to analyze 30 years of conflictualities, in France, around artificial lighting, overlapping three entries. (i) The various causes from the coming into dispute and the different types of conflicts. (ii) The actors, their "worlds" and regimes of justification. (iii) The effects of these conflicts on and in the territories (geographical, organizational or institutional proximities, consideration of the night and reconfigurations of public policy, etc.) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates one of {{the main}} sources of {{financial}} markets’ public information: financial analysts’ reports. We analyze reports on S&P 500 index through a multidisciplinary approach integrating behavioral finance with linguistic analysis to understand how financial phenomena reflect in or are deviated by language, i. e. whether financial and linguistic trends follow the same patterns, boosting each other, or diverge. In the latter, language could conceal financial events, mitigating analysts’ feelings and misleading investors. Therefore, we attempt to identify behavioral biases (mainly represented by <b>cognitive</b> <b>dissonances)</b> present in analysts’ reports. In doing so, we try to understand whether analysts try to hide perception of negative price-sensitive events or not, eventually anticipating and controlling the market “mood”. The study focuses on how analysts use linguistic strategies in order to minimize their risk of issuing wrong advice. Our preliminary results show reluctance to incorporate negative information in the reports. A slight asymmetry between the use of positive/negative keywords taken into account and the negative/positive trends of the index seems to emerge. In those weeks characterized by the index poor performances, the frequency of keywords with a negative meaning is lower. On the contrary, in the recovering weeks a higher use of keywords with a positive meaning does not clearly appear. A thorough investigation on the market moods, and the analysis of the text of the reports enable us to assess if and to what extent analysts have been willing to mitigate pessimism or emphasize confidence. Furthermore, we contribute to the existing literature also proposing a possible analysts’ value function based on the Prospect Theory [Kahneman and Tversky, 1979] where analysts try to maximize the value deriving from enhancing their reputation, taking into account the risks that may cause a reputational loss. This theoretical framework supports our preliminary findings and supports the idea that analysts are risk-averse when facing reputational gains and risk-seeking in case of potential reputational losses...|$|R

40|$|UnrestrictedThe Kronos Project is an {{experiment}} in reducing the formal elements of a classical style role playing game (RPG) {{in order to get}} players engaged and immersed in its system as rapidly as possible. Unlike typical pencil and paper RPGs, it eschews dice-rolling, statistics, and lengthy character generation. This is contrary to current tropes about how role-playing games should be experienced.; The experience is manipulated through multimedia and interactivity in general to enhance the level of immersion and engagement of the players. The following techniques are utilized: 1. Statistics Removal (SR) : Typical number-generating schemes of the genre have been eliminated in favor of players being the in-game characters themselves with their normal skills. No hit points, no mana. 2. Computerised Visual and Audio Mediation (CVAM) : Overhead projections of maps and other important informative devices, including a music delivery system, are used to enhance the ambience. 3. Indoctrination: In the fifteen minute rendition of the game, a game master (GM) spends the first five minutes familiarizing himself/herself with the players in order to enable the procession of the game {{within the context of the}} virtual milieu and the players’ real abilities. 4. Magic: There is a foot-operated push button device (PBD), hidden from the players, which is used by the GM to control images…and possibly music. This will allow players to focus more on game-play than the GM’s mechanisms. In the past, adding music and images to an RPG was done through integrating and swapping media via recording/playing devices (like tape recorders) and drawings on paper. Although it is recognized that producing media changes typically alter game-flow in RPGs, they are generally tolerated by players…to a degree. The PBD is intended to reduce that degree. “Magic” also adds to the mystique of the game and contributes to its eccentric flavor, and hence increases players’ immersion and engagement.; By removing the paper and pencil elements from the game, and by coordinating visual and auditory media, an attempt has been made to ameliorate the cognitive loads of the players by diminishing <b>cognitive</b> <b>dissonances,</b> but no formal examinations have been conducted to confirm the efficacy of this strategy.; Also, still with streamlining complexity in mind, the brunt of the context and content of the game is shouldered by the GM, so the players can rapidly learn the rules of, and settle into, the game through a guided balance of simplicity and complexity...|$|R
