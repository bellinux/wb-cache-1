60|$|Dick Four <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> critically, {{and squinted}} down a large red nose.|$|E
6000|$|Once more {{he spread}} his black wings and flew down to the egg. He <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{to one side and}} looked at it. He <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to the other side and looked at it. He walked all around it, chuckling and saying to himself, [...] "Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty and all mine, mine, mine, mine! Pretty, pretty, and all mine!" ...|$|E
60|$|Naismith, a youngish man of thirty, with glasses, smiled sheepishly and <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> at his companion.|$|E
60|$|Then Wang heard, {{much more}} faint, a voice {{he had never}} heard before--a novel {{impression}} which he acknowledged by <b>cocking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> slightly to one side.|$|R
6000|$|Are sinners! Strange! The bee that blunders [...] Against me {{goes off}} with a laugh. A {{squirrel}} <b>cocks</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> on the fence, and [...] wonders ...|$|R
60|$|He, on his part, {{looked at}} me, <b>cocking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> {{with a fire}} of triumph in his eyes; and I {{understood}} at once that he had thus hazarded his life, merely to attract Clara's notice, and depose me from my position as {{the hero of the}} hour. He snapped his fingers.|$|R
60|$|Pat Hawe <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to one side, like a vulture {{about to}} strike with his beak, and cunningly eyed Madeline.|$|E
60|$|He <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and eyed me aslant, the {{suspicion}} {{in his eyes}} confirming {{the existence of the}} mystery I scented.|$|E
60|$|He made {{a certain}} move {{of his hand}} and the canine {{suddenly}} sat upon his haunches and <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to one side.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{will not}} be easy to find another tree that would make such good snow-shoes,' {{answered}} the fox, <b>cocking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> on one side, and gazing at the tree thoughtfully; 'but I do not like to be ill-natured, so if you will give me one of your young ones I will seek my snow-shoes elsewhere.' ...|$|R
40|$|I N THE {{blackness}} of the sidesiiect. a dimly lit sign danced over an open door. Skewing <b>his</b> eyes and <b>cocking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> backwards, Billy {{could just make out}} the words in the bluish glowâ€”The Blue Fox. Now. to him. thai seemed a hilariously funny name and he let out a whoop of uncontrollable laughter as Al and Tom half-carried, half-dragged him inside. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, well, well!" [...] {{sounded the}} voice of his friend, the fat man, who stood at the desk paying his bill. [...] "Pretty easy, heh? Two boxes for one cent! Sting the restaurant." [...] <b>Cocking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> he {{carefully}} inserted a cent in the slot and clattered the lever, turning to grin at Mr. Wrenn, who grinned back as the machine failed to work.|$|R
60|$|He {{thought and}} he thought {{and he thought}} and he thought, and little by little a plan worked out in his little black head. Then he chuckled. He chuckled right out loud, then hurriedly looked {{around to see if}} any one had heard him. No one had, so he chuckled again. He <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> on one side and half closed his eyes, as if that plan was {{something}} he could see and he was looking at it very hard. Then he <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{on the other side and}} did the same thing.|$|E
6000|$|Shorty <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> triumphantly {{toward a}} tin pail of eggs on the table. [...] "Seven dollars a clatter, though," [...] he confessed, after another minute of silent rubbing.|$|E
60|$|To {{this the}} Beggar listened with his {{knuckles}} resting against his hips, and when Robin had ended he <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{on one side}} and thrust his tongue into his cheek.|$|E
60|$|Alvina {{flew down}} to peep {{round the corner}} of the shop window. There stood the two men, Mr. May like a perky, pink-faced grey bird {{standing}} <b>cocking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in attention to James Houghton, and occasionally catching James by the lapel of his coat, in a vain desire to get a word in, whilst James's <b>head</b> nodded and <b>his</b> face simply wagged with excited speech, as he skipped from foot to foot, and shifted round his listener.|$|R
60|$|Patty was {{forbidden}} to chase or touch him at these times, but always felt {{a strong desire}} to have just one grab at him and see how he felt. That day, being alone in the dining-room, she found it impossible to resist; and when Tweedle-dee came tripping pertly over the table-cloth, <b>cocking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> on one side with shrill chirps and little prancings, she caught him, and for a minute held him fast in spite of his wrathful pecking.|$|R
6000|$|... "Had one {{objection}} to Moosu," [...] he began, <b>cocking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> meditatively--"one objection, and only one. He was an Indian from {{over on the}} edge of the Chippewyan country, but the trouble was, he'd picked up a smattering of the Scriptures. Been campmate a season with a renegade French Canadian who'd studied for the church. Moosu'd never seen applied Christianity, and <b>his</b> <b>head</b> was crammed with miracles, battles, and dispensations, and what not he didn't understand. Otherwise he was a good sort, and a handy man on trail or over a fire.|$|R
60|$|He <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> {{and looked}} at it with his right eye. Then he hopped round to the other side, {{and looked at}} it with his left eye. With either optic it seemed equally desirable.|$|E
6000|$|Jimmy went on quickly:--"You're like a poll-parrot, like a screechin' poll-parrot." [...] Donkin {{stopped and}} <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> attentively on one side. His big ears stood out, {{transparent}} and veined, resembling the thin {{wings of a}} bat.|$|E
6000|$|... "His name's Harvey," [...] said Dan, waving two strangely shaped knives, [...] "an' he'll {{be worth}} five of any Sou' Boston clam-digger 'fore long." [...] He laid the knives tastefully on the table, <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> on one side, and admired the effect.|$|E
6000|$|Ovid's eyes {{followed}} her compassionately. [...] "Poor wretch!" [...] he thought. [...] "What an infernal temper, {{and how hard}} she tries to control it!" [...] He joined Carmina, with a new delight in being near her again. Zo was still in ecstasies over the Piping Crow. [...] "Oh, the jolly little chap! Look how he <b>cocks</b> <b>his</b> <b>head!</b> He mocks me when I whistle. Buy him," [...] cried Zo, tugging at Ovid's coat tails in the excitement that possessed her; [...] "buy him, and let me take him home with me!" ...|$|R
60|$|Silas {{was awakened}} from the stupor into which his terrible {{discovery}} had plunged {{him by a}} prolonged but discreet tapping at the door. It took him some seconds to remember his position; and when he hastened to prevent anyone from entering {{it was already too}} late. Dr. Noel, in a tall night-cap, carrying a lamp which lighted up his long white countenance, sidling in his gait, and peering and <b>cocking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> like some sort of bird, pushed the door slowly open, and advanced {{into the middle of the}} room.|$|R
6000|$|... "'What did {{you have}} to do with it?' he asked, <b>cocking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in what I always thought a most impudent manner. Do you know, he puts on more airs and graces than a peacock, simply because he's the only bird that has a red vest to go with a brown coat? Of course I told him the whole story, though there wasn't any need for me to say that I'd been frightened nearly out of my wits, and before I'd {{finished}} Mr. Crow called the meeting to order.|$|R
6000|$|At {{this the}} jolly Beggar <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> on one side, like a rogue of a magpie. Quoth he, [...] "I am an ill jug to pour heavy things into, good friend, and, if I mistake not, thou hast few serious words to spare at any time." ...|$|E
60|$|Reddy Fox {{sat down}} with his big bushy tail curled around to keep his toes warm, <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> on one side, {{and looked up at}} Blacky the Crow {{as if he were trying}} to see right inside that black head to find out what was going on there.|$|E
60|$|Tarzan <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{upon one}} side and thought, and {{before he went to}} sleep that night, curled in the crotch of the great tree above the village, Teeka filled his mind, and {{afterward}} she filled his dreams--she and the young black men laughing and talking with the young black women.|$|E
60|$|The man in {{the corner}} <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> funny birdlike <b>head</b> well {{on one side and}} looked at her, highly amused evidently at her perplexity.|$|R
2500|$|Television critic Andrew Dansby compares Parsons's {{physical}} comedy {{to that of}} Buster Keaton {{and other}} silent film stars. Lorre praises Parsons' instincts, saying that [...] "You can't teach that." [...] Lorre describes Parsons' [...] "great sense of control over every part of his body, the way he walks, holds <b>his</b> hands, <b>cocks</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> the facial tics as 'inspired'." [...] Reviewer Lewis Beale describes Parsons' performance as [...] "so spot-on, {{it seems as if}} the character and the actor are the same person." [...] Parsons admits that the work is [...] "more effort than I ever thought a sitcom would take. And that's really the fun of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|And he did. He arose a victor. There was no uneasiness, {{but rather}} {{all the social}} polish of Mrs. Arty's at its best, in his manner, as he crossed to Mrs. Ebbitt's chair and asked: [...] "How is Mr. Ebbitt to-night? Pretty rheumatic?" [...] Miss Proudfoot offered him a lime tablet, and he {{accepted}} it judicially. [...] "I believe these tablets are just {{about as good as}} Park & Tilford's," [...] he said, <b>cocking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "Say, Dunk, I'll match you to see who rushes a growler of beer. Tom'll be here pretty soon--store ought to be closed by now. We'll have some ready for him." ...|$|R
60|$|Numa {{was looking}} right {{into his eyes}} now evidently {{aware that he was}} alive. Presently the lion <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> on one side and whined. Tarzan knew the note, and he knew that it spelled neither rage nor hunger, and then he risked all on a single throw, {{encouraged}} by that low whine.|$|E
60|$|Many times, in {{the course}} of the day, alertly and nonchalantly, almost with a quizzical knowingness, Jerry <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> at the {{mainsail}} when it made sudden swooping movements or slacked and tautened its crashing sheet-gear. But he no longer crouched to spring for it. That had been the first lesson, and quickly mastered.|$|E
60|$|A {{half hour}} later a naked giant, {{swinging}} easily through the lower branches of the trees, paused, and with raised head, and dilating nostrils sniffed the morning air. The smell of blood fell strong upon his senses, and mingled with it was the scent of Numa, the lion. The giant <b>cocked</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> upon one side and listened.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then who, in your opinion," [...] {{he asked}} sarcastically, and <b>cocking</b> <b>his</b> funny birdlike <b>head</b> on one side, [...] "tried to sell diamond {{earrings}} to Mr. Campbell, the jeweller?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Goren {{served in}} the U.S. Army's Criminal Investigation Division and was {{stationed}} in Germany and Korea. He joined the NYPD as a detective, serving in the Narcotics Division, and later as a detective in the Major Case Squad. His mentor, FBI criminal profiler Declan Gage, {{taught him how to}} use his intelligence, empathy and imagination to construct complex psychological profiles of suspects. Goren also learned how to use his physicality to intimidate and unsettle people while interrogating them, the most famous example being his habit - introduced in the pilot episode, [...] "" [...] - of <b>cocking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> at odd angles in order to maintain eye contact with someone who is trying to avoid his gaze.|$|R
5000|$|A. O. Scott, in {{his review}} for The New York Times, had {{problems}} with Phoenix's performance: [...] "Even though his singing voice doesn't match the original - how could it? - he is most convincing in concert, when his shoulders tighten and he <b>cocks</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to one side. Otherwise, he seems stuck {{in the kind of}} off-the-rack psychological straitjacket in which Hollywood likes to confine troubled geniuses". In his review for Time, Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "A lot of credit for Phoenix's performance has to go to Mangold, who has always been good at finding the bleak melodrama in taciturn souls ... If Mangold's new movie has a problem, it's that he and co-screenwriter Gill Dennis sometimes walk the lines of the inspirational biography too rigorously".|$|R
