The addition of shelly debris also reduces numbers of N.californiensis both by preventing the settlement of larvae, and through predation on the young N.californiensis by young Dungeness crabs in the shelly debris.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of the equilibrium in the <b>carbamate</b> formation/decomposition depends on {{the product of the}} partial pressures of the reactants. In the total recycle processes, <b>carbamate</b> decomposition is promoted by reducing the overall pressure, which reduces the partial pressure of both ammonia and carbon dioxide. It is possible, however, to achieve a similar effect without lowering the overall pressureâ€”by suppressing the partial pressure of just one of the reactants. Instead of feeding carbon dioxide gas directly to the reactor with the ammonia, as in the total recycle process, the stripping process first routes the carbon dioxide through a stripper (a <b>carbamate</b> decomposer that operates under full system pressure and configured to provide maximum gas-liquid contact). This flushes out free ammonia, reducing its partial pressure over the liquid surface and carrying it directly to a <b>carbamate</b> condenser (also under full system pressure). From there, reconstituted ammonium <b>carbamate</b> liquor passes directly to the reactor. That eliminates the medium-pressure stage of the total recycle process altogether.|$|E

40|$|With the {{modified}} Hammett-Taft cross-interaction variations, multiple linear regressions {{of the chemical}} shifts of NH protons, pK(a), logk([OH]), -logK(i), logk(c) and logk(i) values for both substituted phenyl N-n-butyl <b>carbamates</b> (1) and 4 -nitrophenyl-N-substituted <b>carbamates</b> 2 give linear correlations, and the cross-interaction constants are - 0. 5, 0. 3, - 2. 4, 2, 1 and 2, respectively. The cross-interaction constant for the correlation of the chemical shifts of NH protons indicates that the pseudo-traits conformers are major conformers of <b>carbamates</b> 1 and 2 in CDCl 3. Thus, the distances between the substituents at nitrogen and phenyl of <b>carbamates</b> 1 and 2 are relatively longer. In the transition states of protonations of <b>carbamates</b> 1 and 2 in aqueous solution (pK(a)), those distances are also longer. However, those distances of transition states for the E 1 cB mechanism of the basic hydrolysis of <b>carbamates</b> 1 and 2 and for the cholesterol esterase inhibition mechanism by <b>carbamates</b> 1 and 2 are relatively shorter based on large absolute values of cross-interaction constants. Moreover, the cholesterol esterase inhibition mechanism by <b>carbamates</b> 1 and 2 is common {{in the formation of}} the tetrahedral intermediate and then the carbamyl enzyme. Based on the stereoelectronic effects, the x-ray structures of cholesterol esterase and large values of the cross-interaction constants, the inhibition mechanism of cholesterol esterase by <b>carbamates</b> 1 and 2 is proposed.

Comparison of different geometries for benzene-di-substituted <b>carbamates,</b> such as benzene- 1, 2 -di-N-octylcarbamate (3) (ortho- 3), benzene- 1, 3 -di-N-octylcarbamate (8) (meta- 8), and benzene- 1, 4 -di-N-octylcarbamates (13) (para- 13), indicates that inhibitory potencies are as followed: meta- 8 > para- 13 > ortho- 3.

40|$|Alkyl-N-phenyl <b>carbamates</b> (2 - 8) (see Figure 1), alkyl-N-phenyl thiocarbamates (9 - 15), 2, 2 '-biphenyl- 2 -ol- 2 '-N-substituted <b>carbamates</b> (16 - 23), and 2, 2 '-biphenyl- 2 -N-octadecylcarbamate- 2 '-N-substituted <b>carbamates</b> (24 - 31) are {{prepared}} and evaluated for their inhibition effects on porcine pancreatic cholesterol esterase and Pseudomona species lipase. All inhibitors are characterized as transient or pseudo substrate inhibitors for both enzymes. Both enzymes are not protected from inhibition and further inactivated by <b>carbamates</b> 2 - 8 and thiocarbamates 9 - 15 {{in the presence}} of trifluoroacetophenone. Therefore, <b>carbamates</b> 2 - 8 and thiocarbamates 9 - 15 are exceptions for active site binding inhibitors and are probably the second alkyl-chain binding-site-directed inhibitors for both enzymes. The inhibition data for <b>carbamates</b> 2 - 8 and thiocarbamates 9 - 15 are correlated with the steric constant, E-s, and the hydrophobicity constant, pi; however, the inhibition data are not correlated with the Taft substituent constant, sigma*. A comparison of the inhibition data for <b>carbamates</b> 2 - 8 and thiocarbamates 9 - 15 toward both enzymes indicates that thiocarbamates 9 - 15 are more potent inhibitors than <b>carbamates</b> 2 - 8. A comparison of the inhibition data for cholesterol esterase and Pseudomona species lipase by <b>carbamates</b> 2 - 8 or thiocarbamates 9 - 15 indicates that cholesterol esterase is more sensitive to the E-s and pi values than Pseudomona species lipase. The negative slope values for the logarithms of inhibition data for Pseudomona species lipase by <b>carbamates</b> 2 - 8 and thiocarbamates 9 - 15 versus E-s and pi indicate that the second alkyl-chain-binding site of Pseudomona species lipase is huge, hydrophilic, compared to that of cholesterol esterase, and prefers to interact with a bulky, hydrophilic inhibitor rather than a small, hydrophobic one. On the contrary, the second alkyl-chain-binding site of cholesterol esterase prefers to bind to a small, hydrophobic inhibitor. Both enzymes are protected from inhibition by <b>carbamates</b> 16 - 23 {{in the presence of}} trifluoroacetophenone. Therefore, <b>carbamates</b> 16 - 23 are characterized as the alkyl chain binding site, esteratic site oxyanion active site directed pseudo substrate inhibitors for both enzymes. Both enzyme inhibition data for <b>carbamates</b> 16 - 22 are well-correlated with sigma* alone. The negative rho* values for these correlations indicate that the serine residue of both enzymes and <b>carbamates</b> 16 - 22 forms the tetrahedral species with more positive charges than inhibitors and the enzymes and follow the formation of the carbamyl enzymes with more positive charges than the tetrahedral species. <b>Carbamates</b> 24 - 31 are also exceptions for active site binding inhibitors and probably the second alkyl chain binding site-directed inhibitors for both enzymes. However, the enzyme inhibition constants for <b>carbamates</b> 24 - 31 are correlated with values of sigma*, E-s, and pi. The negative rho* values for these correlations indicate that both enzymes and <b>carbamates</b> 24 - 31 form the tetrahedral species with more positive charges than inhibitors and the enzymes and follow the formation of the carbamyl enzymes with more positive charges than those tetrahedral species. Therefore, <b>carbamates</b> 24 - 31 may bind to both the active sites and the second alkyl chain binding site and follow the evacuation of the active sites. A comparison of the rho* values for cholesterol esterase and Pseudomona species lipase by <b>carbamates</b> 24 - 31 indicates that cholesterol esterase is much more sensitive to the sigma* values than Pseudomona species lipase. The negative sensitivity values, 9, for the cholesterol esterase inhibitions by <b>carbamates</b> 24 - 31 indicate that the enzyme prefers to bind to a bulky carbamyl group rather than bind to a small one. The hydrophobicity of <b>carbamates</b> 24 - 31 does not {{play a major role in}} both enzyme inhibitions...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{relatively}} low persistence and high effectiveness for insect and pest eradication, organophosphates (OPs) and <b>carbamates</b> {{are the two}} major classes of pesticides that broadly used in agriculture.

In this current study, a colorimetric sensor array comprising five inexpensive and commercially available thiocholine and H 2 O 2 sensitive indicators for the simultaneous detection and identification of OPs and <b>carbamates</b> is developed. The sensing methanism of this array {{is based on the}} irreversible inhibition capability of OPs and <b>carbamates</b> to the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), preventing production of thiocholine and H 2 O 2 from S-acetylthiocholine and acetylcholine and thus resulting in decreased or no color reactions to thiocholine and H 2 O 2 sensitive indicators. Through recognition patterns and standard statistical methods (i. e., hierarchical clustering analysis and principal component analysis), the as-developed array demonstrates riot only discrimination of OPs and <b>carbamates</b> from other kinds of pesticides but, more interestingly, identification of them exactly from each other.
