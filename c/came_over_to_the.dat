25|$|The slaves did not {{immediately}} flock to Sonthonax's banner, however. White colonists continued to fight Sonthonax, with assistance from the British. They were joined {{by many of the}} free men of color who opposed the abolition of slavery. It was not until word of France's ratification of emancipation arrived back in the colony that Toussaint Louverture and his corps of well disciplined, battle-hardened former slaves <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> French Republican side in early May 1794. A change in the political winds in France caused Sonthonax to be recalled in 1796, but not before taking the step of arming the former slaves.|$|E
25|$|Since 1562 France {{had been}} in the grip of the French Wars of Religion, in which Spain had {{regularly}} intervened in favour of the Catholic League of France. King Henry IV of France (French: Henri de Bourbon) had been fighting for the protestant cause, but in 1594 had converted to Catholicism in Paris on March 22nd 1593. The example of Paris was followed by other towns and cities with several chiefs of the League <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king. Henry now directed his chief attention to the fortified towns of Picardy and Champagne from their contiguity to the Spanish Netherlands. From there he received the forced or voluntary submission of the most considerable and at last began to think seriously of his engagements to Elizabeth I of England.|$|E
25|$|Having secured {{possession}} of the two principal towns of the island of Euboea, Flamininus set sail for Cenchreae, and began {{to prepare for the}} siege of Corinth. Although he was able to take Cenchreae, he was beaten back when he tried to overrun the Corinthian defences. After receiving instructions from his brother, the proconsul in charge of the war, Flamininus sent ambassadors to the Achaean League, asking for their support in the war. Most of the city-states <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Roman side, joining Flamininus in the siege of Corinth. When the Achaean forces joined his legions, the troops under his command managed to equal the number of defenders in the city, who included a large number of Italians who had deserted the Romans during the Second Punic War. In the end Flamininus was unable to break through their defences, and he was forced to abandon the siege. He returned to his fleet and set sail for Corcyra, where he stationed himself during the winter.|$|E

After {{the completion of}} MDNA, critics around the world were invited to Abbey Road Studios for an initial review of the album.

500|$|In May 1334, the {{situation}} looked dire {{for the house}} of Bruce and David II gained safety in France. [...] Robert set about winning back his lands in the west of Scotland. [...] Strathbogie <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bruce interest after disagreements with his fellow 'disinherited' but his fierce opposition to Randolph {{came to a head}} at a Parliament held at Dairsie Castle in early 1335 when Strathbogie received the support of Robert. [...] Strathbogie once again changed sides and submitted to the English king in August and was made Warden of Scotland. [...] It seems that Strathbogie may also have persuaded Robert to submit to Edward and Balliol—Sir Thomas Gray, in his Scalacronica claimed that he had actually done so—and may explain his removal as Guardian around this time. [...] The Bruce resistance to Balliol may have been verging on collapse in 1335 but a turn-round in its fortunes began with the appearance of Sir Andrew Murray of Bothwell as a potent war leader at the Battle of Culblean. [...] Murray had been captured in 1332, ransomed himself in 1334, and immediately sped north to lay siege to Dundarg Castle in Buchan held by Sir Henry de Beaumont, with the castle falling on 23 December 1334. [...] Murray was appointed Guardian at Dunfermline during the winter of 1335–6 while he was besieging Cupar Castle in Fife. [...] He died at his castle in Avoch in 1338 and Robert resumed the Guardianship. [...] Murray's campaign put an end to any chance of Edward III having full lasting control over the south of Scotland and Edward's failure in the six-month siege of Dunbar Castle confirmed this. [...] Balliol lost many of his major supporters to the Bruce side and the main English garrisons began to fall to the Scots—Cupar in the spring or summer of 1339, Perth taken by Robert also in 1339 and Edinburgh by William, Earl of Douglas in April 1341.|$|E
