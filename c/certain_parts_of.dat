The memory of Napoleon in Poland is favorable, for his support for independence and opposition to Russia, his legal code, the abolition of serfdom, and the introduction of modern middle class bureaucracies.|$|E
5|$|Benicio del Toro had {{significant}} input into <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the film; for example, he suggested a simpler, more concise way of depicting his character kidnapping Francisco Flores that Soderbergh ended up using. The director cut {{a scene in}} which Robert Wakefield smokes crack after finding it in his daughter's bedroom. After rehearsing this scene with the actors, he felt that the character would not do it; after consulting with Gaghan, the screenwriter agreed and the filmmakers cut the scene shortly before it was scheduled to be shot.|$|E
5|$|Sakura {{has become}} the series' female lead, although, she was not {{immediately}} intended for the role.

5|$|The Asiatic dayflower is {{considered}} a weed both in areas where it was introduced and in <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> its native range. The flowers' interactions with pollinators have been well studied and have helped to support important hypotheses about pollination {{in the field of}} plant ecology. Recent research has also revealed that the Asiatic dayflower can bioaccumulate a number of metals, making it a candidate for revegetating and essentially cleaning spoiled copper mines. Several animals and fungi use the plant as a food source, with a few species feeding upon it exclusively.|$|E
5|$|The Condor Legion spearheaded many Nationalist victories, {{particularly}} providing air dominance from 1937 onwards; 300 air-to-air victories were claimed, {{although this}} was dwarfed by some 900 claimed by Italian forces. Spain provided a proving ground for German tank tactics, {{as well as}} aircraft tactics, the latter being only moderately successful. The air superiority which allowed <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the Legion to excel would be replicated {{in the first year}} of World War II, until ultimately failing to prevail in the Battle of Britain.|$|E

Following a series of political agreements concluded in 1991 and a ceasefire between the JNA and Croatia in early 1992, the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was deployed for peacekeeping in <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> Croatia, including Vukovar and its surroundings.

5|$|In the 1970s, {{southeast}} Asian jungle cats {{still used}} to be the most common wild cats near villages in <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> northern Thailand and occurred in many protected areas of the country. However, since the early 1990s, jungle cats are rarely encountered and have suffered drastic declines due to hunting and habitat destruction. Today, their official status in the country is critically endangered. In Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, jungle cats have been subject to extensive hunting. Skins are occasionally recorded in border markets, and live individuals, possibly taken from Myanmar or Cambodia, occasionally turn up in the Khao Khieo and Chiang Mai zoos of Thailand.|$|E
5|$|In {{the trail}} of the related {{negative}} publicity, Turner accepted the lead role in Ross Hunter's remake of Imitation of Life (1959) under the direction of Douglas Sirk. Universal Studios capitalized on her new-found notoriety; the result {{was one of the biggest}} hits of the year, and the biggest of Turner's career; she owned 50% of the earnings of the picture and during just the first year of the film's release she earned $11 million. According to Hunter, the film made an excess of $50 million in box office receipts. Critics and audiences could not help noticing that the plots of Peyton Place and Imitation of Life each seemed to mirror <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> Turner's private life. Specifically, both films depicted the troubled, complicated relationship between a single mother and her teenaged daughter.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the game's release, several {{trailers}} {{were released}} for it, detailing its development progress and the improvements in <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the game. The game also had three pre-order tiers, each coming with different amounts of in-game content. A public beta {{for the game}} was initiated prior to the game's release for testing. It contained the HUT, EASHL and Online Versus modes {{as well as the}} Creation Zone. Critics who played the beta wrote generally positive reviews and noted it as a good precursor to the full game. Upon its release, NHL 17 received generally positive reviews from critics. The gameplay improvements and new additions to the game mainly received praise, while criticism was aimed at some lack of depth and general innovation.|$|E

This Act released the LNC from those compulsory purchases of land which had been mandated by the 1852 Act but {{had not yet been}} completed, easing the immediate financial burden. It also allowed a ten-year window for the LNC to sell <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the land bought from Lord Onslow which were not required for the cemetery, to provide a source of income.|$|E
5|$|The addax live {{in desert}} terrain where they eat grasses and leaves of what shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes are available. Primarily grazers, their staple foods include Aristida, Panicum, and Stipagrostis, {{and they will}} only consume browse, such as leaves of Acacia trees {{in the absence of}} these grasses. Perennials which turn green and sprout at the {{slightest}} bit of humidity or rain. The addax eat only <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the plant and tend to crop the Aristida grasses neatly to the same height. By contrast, when feeding on Panicum grass, the drier outer leaves are left alone while they eat the tender, inner shoots and seeds. These seeds are important part of the addax diet, being their main source of protein.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} ovoviviparous, with females {{giving birth to}} one to 16 live young and {{possibly}} as many as 20. However, litters of six to eight are the most common. Neonates are 22–35cm in length (excluding runts), with the largest being A. p. conanti and A. p. leucostoma the smallest. If weather conditions are favorable and food is readily available, growth is rapid and females may reproduce at {{less than three years}} of age and a total length of as little as 60cm. The young are born in August or September, while mating may occur during any of the warmer months of the year, at least in <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> its range.|$|E

5|$|A dun-colored {{coat with}} {{primitive}} markings {{that include a}} dorsal stripe and often leg striping and transverse shoulder stripes reflect the wildtype coat and are observed in most wild extant equine species. Only the mountain zebra lacks a dorsal stripe. In domestic horses, dun color and primitive markings exist in some animals across many breeds. The purpose of the bold black-and-white striping of zebras has been a subject of debate among biologists for over a century, but recent (2014) evidence supports the theory {{that they are a}} form of protection from biting flies. These insects appear to be less attracted to striped coats and, compared to other wild equines, zebras live in areas with the highest fly activity. With the exception of the domestic horses, which have long manes that lay over the neck and long tail hair growing {{from the top of the}} tailhead or dock, most equines have erect manes and long tails ending in a tuft of hair. The coats of some equine species undergo shedding in <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> their range and are thick in the winter.|$|E
5|$|As Tropical Depression Five-E {{approached}} Mexico, the country's government released {{tropical storm}} watches and warnings for <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the coastline. When the tropical depression formed on July 5, the government issued {{a tropical storm}} warning from Acapulco to Zihuatanejo. Other interests in the Pacific Ocean were asked {{to keep an eye}} on the developing depression. The morning of July 6, the Mexican government issued a tropical storm watch for Zihuatanejo to Manzanillo. The earlier tropical storm warning remained in effect, for another six hours, when the warning was demoted into a tropical storm watch. On the afternoon of July 6, the government discontinued the tropical storm watch up to Acapulco. The remaining tropical storm watch was discontinued on July 7, after the tropical depression had made landfall and began to weaken. The government's weather center also released thirteen tropical cyclone bulletins and four warnings for personal caution.|$|E
5|$|Chahi {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} Another Worlds intellectual property from Delphine Software International after they closed down in July 2004. Magic Productions then offered to port the game to mobile phones, and it was ported with help from Cyril Cogordan. Chahi saw that the game's playability could be improved, so he used his old Amiga for reprogramming <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the script and made the graphics' shading clearer in order to counter mobile phones' low resolutions. In July 2005, almost {{a decade and a}} half after it was first released on the Amiga, the game was released for mobile phone handsets using the Symbian operating system, thanks to Telcogames and developer Magic Productions. In 2006, Magic Productions also released a remastered Pocket PC version for Windows Mobile 5.0 OS or later in QVGA (320×240 resolution). Telcogames entered administration in 2008, closing the Magic Productions studio.
