25|$|A Wonder Pot is an Israeli {{invention}} {{that acts}} as a Dutch oven but is made of aluminium. It consists of three parts: an aluminium pot shaped like a Bundt pan, a hooded cover perforated with venting holes, and a thick, round, metal disc with a <b>centre</b> <b>hole</b> that is placed between the Wonder Pot and the flame to disperse heat.|$|E
25|$|The four {{fingers of}} the left hand can each be used {{in at least two}} {{different}} positions, three {{in the case of the}} index finger. The key normally operated by this finger is primarily used for E4. (Rarely it can be used as a trill key.) This key has a small hole drilled into it. The player can lift the finger completely off the key, or press the key down, closing the hole. A third possibility is to slide the finger down, so the key remains closed, but the hole is open. The middle finger typically stays on the <b>centre</b> <b>hole</b> on the tenor joint. It can also move to a lever used for E4 and a rarely-used trill key. The ring finger operates, on most models, one key. Some models, like a Polisi Artist bassoon, have two assignments. The upper assignment is used for alternate fingerings in the alto register. The smallest finger operates two side keys on the bass joint. The lower key is typically used for C1. The upper key is used for E1, E3, F3, F3, A4, B4, B4, C4, C4, and D4.|$|E

30|$|The {{action of}} X-ray {{irradiation}} on glasses {{is to produce}} secondary electrons from the sites where {{they are in a}} stable state and have an excess energy. Such electrons may traverse in the glass network depending upon their energy and the composition of the glass and are finally trapped, thus forming colour centres (or alternatively they may form excitons with energy states in the forbidden gap). The trapping sites may be the neodymium ions which constitute the glass structure, ions of admixtures to the main composition and the structural defects due to impurities in the glass. Thus this process leads to the formation of (1) boron electron centres, (2) non-bridging oxygen <b>hole</b> <b>centres</b> and (3) boron oxygen <b>hole</b> <b>centres</b> [35, 36, 37]. Thermoluminescence is a consequence of radiative recombination between the electrons (released by heating from electron centre) and an anti-bonding molecular orbital of the nearest of the oxygen <b>hole</b> <b>centres.</b> The observed TL peaks in the present glasses can be attributed due to such radiation.|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} radiation-induced defect {{formation}} in glasses is of growing interest for applications in optics and photonics. The influence of Tb 3 + ions on X-ray-induced defects has been examined in glasses with different phosphate contents. The defects have {{been characterized by}} optical absorption and ESR spectroscopy. (Tb 3 +) + ions are formed by X-ray irradiation. They exhibit a broad charge transfer band at 370 nm. The formation of (Tb 3 +) + <b>hole</b> <b>centres</b> suppresses the formation of intrinsic phosphate-related <b>hole</b> <b>centres,</b> absorbing in the visible region. PO 3 defects absorbing in the ultraviolet region contribute mainly to the electron centres corresponding to the (Tb 3 +) + <b>hole</b> <b>centres.</b> Immediately after X-ray irradiation, 5 – 10 % of the Tb 3 + ions have been oxidized. The amount of (Tb 3 +) + ions increases with increasing phosphate content. The stability of the (Tb 3 +) + ions at room temperature depends on glass composition and melting conditions...|$|R

50|$|Deep hole {{drilling}} (DHD) is a residual stress measurement technique {{used to measure}} locked-in and applied stresses in engineering materials and components. DHD is a semi-destructive mechanical strain relaxation (MSR) technique, which seeks to measure the distribution of stresses along the axis of a drilled reference hole. The process is unique {{in its ability to}} measure residual stresses at a microscopic level with a penetration of over 750 mm, without total destruction of the original component. DHD is considered deep in comparison to other {{hole drilling}} techniques such as <b>centre</b> <b>hole</b> drilling.|$|E

50|$|For example, a beam {{component}} was plastically bent {{to introduce}} a known residual stress profile. These residual stresses were then measured using multiple residual stress measurement techniques including Neutron Diffraction, Slitting, Ring Core, Incremental <b>Centre</b> <b>Hole</b> Drilling, Deep Hole Drilling and Incremental Deep Hole Drilling, as well as modelled with finite element software to provide further numerical validation. The correlation between the results from techniques is strong, with DHD and iDHD displaying the same trend and magnitudes as both the numerical simulation and the other experimental techniques. The results from this comparison are shown in the Figure.|$|E

40|$|The {{intergranular}} or transport {{currents in}} sintered YBCO samples have been analysed using both a. c. magnetization for slab sized samples and d. c. magnetization for tubular samples. The magnetization loops of the transport regime {{have to be}} separated from the contribution of the grains and must be properly normalized to obtain meaningful information. The fit of the magnetization is not very sensitive to the form of the field dependence of Jc and does not allow one to distinguish between different theoretical models. A modified Rollins method was therefore used to obtain direct information on the field and current profile inside the slab samples. Creep was measured by the decay of the intergranular Jc in a ring and the data may be interpreted {{within the framework of the}} critical state model to obtain a pinning energy, Uo 2 ∼ 1 eV at very low field, which rapidly decreases by one order of magnitude at a few oersted. A tentative correlation between these two creep regimes, the Jc field dependence, the fluxoid dimensions and the type of pinning <b>centres</b> (<b>holes</b> or junctions) is presented in this paper...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the sensitivity change of multiple-elevated-temperature (MET) stimulated post-infrared infrared-stimulated luminescence (MET-pIRIR) signals {{as a response}} to irradiation, sunlight bleaching and heating using samples from the Mu Us Desert, central China. A strong dose dependence of MET-pIRIR signal sensitivity was observed. The intensity of the test-dose signals (Tx) increase with the pre-dose received. Furthermore, the signal sensitivity can be reset by sunlight bleaching or heating. This suggests that both the electron traps and <b>hole</b> <b>centres</b> in K-feldspar can be bleached by sunlight, and can, therefore, be used for dating. Using the test-dose signal as a monitor for sensitivity change, {{it was found that the}} sensitivity (or <b>hole</b> <b>centres)</b> saturate at a higher dose (D 0 = ∼ 750 Gy) than the sensitivity-corrected signals (or electron traps) (D 0 = ∼ 400 Gy). We propose a multi-aliquot regenerative-dose (MAR) MET-pIRIR dating protocol, which utilises the high saturation dose of <b>hole</b> <b>centres.</b> This protocol was tested using aeolian sediments from north China with ages ranging from 0 to 470 ka. It was found that, compared to the dose limit of ∼ 800 – 1000 Gy using the normal MET-pIRIR or pIRIR procedure, the new method can measure a natural dose of up to ∼ 1500 Gy and produce ages consistent with the expected ages for the samples investigated...|$|R
