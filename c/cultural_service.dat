40|$|Cultural {{capital is}} assumed to benefit all members of society. It is {{accumulated}} through the consumption of <b>cultural</b> goods, <b>cultural</b> <b>services</b> are provided by <b>cultural</b> <b>services</b> industry; the stock of cultural goods is enlarged by the flow of new cultural goods created by individuals who are both consumers and creators of culture and whose utility is positively affected by the cultural goods they created. In the no-policy market economy, individuals tend to ignore the positive external effects of their <b>cultural</b> <b>services</b> consumption and creation of cultural goods on other individuals via augmenting cultural capital and cultural-goods stock. Consequently, less cultural capital and cultural-goods stock will be accumulated. The efficient allocation can be restored by introducing an appropriate subsidy that stimulates the consumers’ demand for <b>cultural</b> <b>services,</b> {{and the creation of}} new cultural goods, promotes the accumulation of cultural capital and cultural goods. <b>cultural</b> capital, <b>cultural</b> <b>services,</b> <b>cultural</b> goods...|$|R
40|$|In post-devolution Scotland, New Labour {{added to}} the role of 'culture' by {{introducing}} ideas of social inclusion to policies concerning <b>cultural</b> <b>services.</b> Ten years later, with the Scottish National Party (SNP) minority government in the Scottish Parliament, do policy makers think social inclusion still has a role within <b>cultural</b> <b>services?</b> This article shows that policy makers' understandings of 'culture' and social inclusion are vague, general and complex. This has encouraged policy makers to think of <b>cultural</b> <b>services</b> as resources to fulfil wider economic and social objectives. At the same time, <b>cultural</b> <b>services</b> are placed at an individual level, with <b>cultural</b> <b>services</b> seen as 'generators of wellbeing', rather than agents of social change. Social inclusion and cultural meanings are linked to individualistic causes of poverty and related to the SNP's economic focus in Scotland. This complexity impacts on the interpretation and implementation of policy and has resulted in the cultural agenda being seen as less of a priority within the new SNP administration...|$|R

2500|$|For {{over twenty}} years Sekelj was a {{committee}} member of UEA and he was single-handedly responsible for the second resolution where UNESCO positively addressed Esperanto in 1985. One-third of his books were originally written in Esperanto. He wrote a great many lucid and cogent articles for various Esperanto-newspapers and magazines, and he drafted Geografia Revuo, E-Gazeto and Velo. But his intense activity {{in the name of}} Esperanto related to his foundation and guide of International Institute for Officialization of Esperanto (IOE) that launched the motto « better practice than 100-hours sermon » like this requiring more open activity of Esperantists. In that sense he especially engaged in diverse travel, organizing bus caravans that traveled across the world, having its greatest impact at the start [...] of the International Puppet Theatre Festival (PIF) in Zagreb and later at the foundation for Internacia Kultura Servo (International <b>Cultural</b> <b>Service).</b> PIF still exists, currently after 44 years and still distributes an annual prize [...] "Tibor Sekelj" [...] for the most humanitarian message. His very intensive activity in the name of IOE had a strong effect on the classical neutral Esperanto-movement in the practical application, on the one hand in terms of culture and tourism and on the other to a more elastic conception of impartiality that followed TEJO.|$|E
