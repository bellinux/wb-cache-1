'Tips' {{denoting}} odd-numbered kup ranks {{are marked by}} a stripe of the higher colour near the right end (from the wearer's point of view) of a belt of the lower <b>colour.</b> <b>Black</b> belts denote the dan ranks.

Junior Black Belt members are tested for 1st dan when they reach 18 years of age. One bar denotes 1st dan, two bars denote 2nd dan, and so on.

2500|$|During ritual practices, {{which are}} often staged in a sacred circle, Wiccans cast spells or [...] "workings" [...] {{intended}} to bring about real changes in the physical world. Common Wiccan spells include those used for healing, for protection, fertility, or to banish negative influences. Many early Wiccans, such as Alex Sanders, Sybil Leek and Alex Winfield, referred to their own magic as [...] "white magic", which contrasted with [...] "black magic", which they associated with evil and Satanism. Sanders also used the similar terminology of [...] "left hand path" [...] to describe malevolent magic, and [...] "right hand path" [...] to describe magic performed with good intentions; terminology that had originated with the occultist Helena Blavatsky in the 19th century. Some modern Wiccans however have stopped using the white-black magic and left-right hand path dichotomies, arguing for instance that the <b>colour</b> <b>black</b> should not necessarily have any associations with evil.|$|E

We are not obliged to hold, either that the Peruvians and Scotch are akin by blood, nor that, at some forgotten time, they met each other, and borrowed each other's superstitions. Again, when we find Odysseus sacrificing a black sheep to the dead, {20} and when we read that the Ovahereroes in South Africa also appease with a black sheep {{the spirits of the}} departed, we do not feel it necessary to hint that the Ovahereroes are of Greek descent, or have borrowed their ritual from the Greeks.
