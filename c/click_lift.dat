40|$|A digital coupon distributing firm selects coupons {{from its}} coupon pool and posts them online for its {{customers}} to activate them. Its {{objective is to}} maximize {{the total number of}} clicks that activate the coupons by sequential arriving customers. This paper resolves this problem by using a multi-armed bandit approach to balance the exploration (learning customers' preference for coupons) with exploitation (maximizing short term activation clicks). The proposed approach is evaluated with synthetic data. Results showed a 60 % <b>click</b> <b>lift</b> compared to the benchmark approach. by Xiang Song. Thesis: S.

40|$|Personalized web {{services}} strive to adapt their services (advertisements, news articles, etc) to individual users by {{making use of}} both content and user information. Despite a few recent advances, this problem remains challenging {{for at least two}} reasons. First, web service is featured with dynamically changing pools of content, rendering traditional collaborative filtering methods inapplicable. Second, the scale of most {{web services}} of practical interest calls for solutions that are both fast in learning and computation. In this work, we model personalized recommendation of news articles as a contextual bandit problem, a principled approach in which a learning algorithm sequentially selects articles to serve users based on contextual information about the users and articles, while simultaneously adapting its article-selection strategy based on user-click feedback to maximize total user clicks. The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we propose a new, general contextual bandit algorithm that is computationally efficient and well motivated from learning theory. Second, we argue that any bandit algorithm can be reliably evaluated offline using previously recorded random traffic. Finally, using this offline evaluation method, we successfully applied our new algorithm to a Yahoo! Front Page Today Module dataset containing over 33 million events. Results showed a 12. 5 % <b>click</b> <b>lift</b> compared to a standard context-free bandit algorithm, and the advantage becomes even greater when data gets more scarce.

60|$|She {{could not}} explain, {{and when the}} meal was done went silently about her {{household}} work, the boy assisting her, for he hated going afield on the farms, and she indulged his reluctance. Between eleven and twelve the garden-gate <b>clicked,</b> and she <b>lifted</b> {{her eyes to the}} window. At the bottom of the garden, within the gate, stood the woman of her vision. Rhoda seemed transfixed.|$|R
50|$|The {{image on}} the right is interesting, in that it shows a 'speclift' that has been {{modified}} to do a standard chain lift as well. This is useful when the casualty will not fit into the speclift's frame, as in this case. You may also note that the rear is being lifted, as it clearly will not tow on a front <b>lift</b> (<b>click</b> the image to enlarge it).|$|R
40|$|Todayâ€™s {{technology}} {{has made it}} possible for news to be disseminated in the quickest manner. Users, especially from the higher learning institutions, need to stay connected with news in order to complete some of their learning processes. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyse the strategies used in marketing and promoting of news by the University of Malaya Library (UML). The effectiveness of these strategies will be analyzed via the number of pages viewed, shares, <b>clicks</b> and viral <b>lift.</b> The study is descriptive in nature in which it will describe the strategies used by the UML to market and promote news and also the effectiveness of these strategies. It is hoped that this study will provide some insights on the marketing and promotion of news by libraries especially at higher learning institutions...|$|R
