2500|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOCs) are emitted as gases from certain solids or liquids. VOCs include {{a variety of}} chemicals, {{some of which may}} have short- and long-term adverse health effects. Concentrations of many VOCs are consistently higher indoors (up to ten times higher) than outdoors. [...] VOCs are emitted by a wide array of products numbering in the thousands. Examples include: paints and lacquers, paint strippers, cleaning supplies, pesticides, building materials and furnishings, office equipment such as copiers and printers, correction fluids and <b>carbonless</b> <b>copy</b> <b>paper,</b> graphics and craft materials including glues and adhesives, permanent markers, and photographic solutions.|$|E
2500|$|A polychlorinated {{biphenyl}} (PCB) is an {{organic chlorine compound}} with the formula C12H10−xClx. [...] Polychlorinated biphenyls were once widely deployed as dielectric and coolant fluids in electrical apparatus, <b>carbonless</b> <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> and in heat transfer fluids. [...] Because of their longevity, PCBs are still widely in use, even though their manufacture has declined drastically since the 1960s, when a host of problems were identified. Because of PCBs' environmental toxicity and classification as a persistent organic pollutant, PCB production was banned by the United States Congress in 1979 and by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in 2001. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), rendered PCBs as definite carcinogens in humans. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), PCBs cause cancer in animals and are probable human carcinogens. Many rivers and buildings including schools, parks, and other sites are contaminated with PCBs, {{and there have been}} contaminations of food supplies with the substances.|$|E

2500|$|BisphenolA is a {{preferred}} color developer in <b>carbonless</b> <b>copy</b> <b>paper</b> and thermal {{point of sale}} receipt paper. When used in thermal paper, BPA is present as [...] "free" [...] (i.e., discrete, non-polymerized) BPA, {{which is likely to}} be more available for exposure than BPA polymerized into a resin or plastic. Upon handling, BPA in thermal paper can be transferred to skin, and there is some concern that residues on hands could be ingested through incidental hand-to-mouth contact. Furthermore, some studies suggest that dermal absorption may contribute some small fraction to the overall human exposure. European data indicate that the use of BPA in paper may also contribute to the presence of BPA in the stream of recycled paper and in landfills. Although there are no estimates for the amount of BPA used in thermal paper in the United States, in Western Europe, the volume of BPA reported to be used in thermal paper in 2005/2006 was 1,890 tonnes per year, while total production was estimated at 1,150,000 tonnes per year. [...] (Figures taken from 2012 EPA draft paper.) Studies document potential spreading and accumulation of BPA in paper recycling, suggesting its presence for decades in paper recycling loop even after a hypothetical ban. Epoxy resin may or may not contain BPA, and is employed to bind gutta percha in some root canal procedures.|$|E
2500|$|Besides diet, {{exposure}} {{can also}} occur through air and through skin absorption. Free BPA {{is found in}} high concentration in thermal paper and <b>carbonless</b> <b>copy</b> <b>paper,</b> which {{would be expected to}} be more available for exposure than BPA bound into resin or plastic. [...] Popular uses of thermal paper include receipts, event and cinema tickets, labels, and airline tickets. A Swiss study found that 11 of 13 thermal printing papers contained [...] (BPA). Upon dry finger contact with a thermal paper receipt, roughly [...] BPA (...) was transferred to the forefinger and the middle finger. For wet or greasy fingers approximately [...] more was transferred. Extraction of BPA from the fingers was possible up to [...] after exposure. Further, it has been demonstrated that thermal receipts placed in contact with paper currency in a wallet for 24 hours cause a dramatic increase in the concentration of BPA in paper currency, making paper money a secondary source of exposure. Another study has identified BPA in all of the waste paper samples analysed (newspapers, magazines, office paper, etc.), indicating direct results of contamination through paper recycling. [...] Free BPA can readily be transferred to skin, and residues on hands can be ingested. Bodily intake through dermal absorption (99% of which comes from handling receipts) has been shown for the general population to be 0.219ng/kg bw/day (occupationally exposed persons absorb higher amounts at 16.3ng/kg bw/day) whereas aggregate intake (food/beverage/environment) for adults is estimated at 0.36–0.43 μg/kg bw/day (estimated intake for occupationally exposed adults is 0.043–100 μg/kg bw/day).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: During the {{reaction}} of solutions of the leuco dyes crystal violet lactone and N-benzoyl leuco methylene blue with acid-treated montmarillonite (as occurs with <b>carbonless</b> <b>copying</b> <b>papers),</b> most of the offered ye is intercalated within the interlayers of the montmorillonite structure remaining after acid attack. This phenomenon was demonstrated by XRD and also by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. During acid treatment, octahedral cations are dissolved from exposed edges of the montmorillonite lamellae and amorphous ilica builds up in these areas. As a result, the BET(N 2) specific surface area increases from ~ 60 mZ/g to ~ 300 mZ/g and, consequently, the theoretical reactivity towards leuco dyes. Nevertheless, only small quantities of the dye molecules are adsorbed onto the amorphous ilica. The excellent colour intensity and, in particular, the resistance to fading {{in the light of}} the montmorillonite dye complexes may be explained by the protected position of the dye molecules within the interlayers of the montmorillonite. Montmoril lonite is capable of intercalating organic molecules between its unit layers (Fahn, 1963) and such compounds with long-chain quaternary alkyl ammonium ions have attained much importance in the paint industry as thixotropic and thickening agents (Fahn & Buckl, 1968). Reactions of dye molecules with acid-activated montmoril lonite are also becoming important in their capacity as colour developers in the acceptor sheet of <b>carbonless</b> <b>copying</b> <b>papers</b> (von Raven & Fended, 1980; Fenderl &von Raven, 1982). The present paper describes the results of an investigation into {{the reaction}}s of dye molecules with acid-activated montmoril lonite to form light-resistant stable complexes. Particular aspects examined were the amount of dye uptake as a function of time, and the physical and chemical changes occurring in the acid-activated montmoril lonite as a result of dye adsorption...|$|R

Microencapsulation {{has great}} {{potential}} extensive applications in fields of cosmetics, pesticides, pharmaceutical and medical applications, foods, biology, catalysis, <b>carbonless</b> <b>copying</b> <b>paper</b> {{and many other}} areas. Gypenosides (GPS) are extracted from Gynostemma pentaphyllum Makino, widely used in Southeast Asian folk medicine or food. In the current study, Gypenosides-loaded microcapsules (GPMC) were prepared by gelatin/gum. Characteristics and bioactivity of the GPMC were evaluated. An up to 80 % encapsulation of GPS at pH 4. 0 was achieved, with 1 : 2 drug to wall materials ratio and a 3 % gelatin/gum arabic while stirring at 500 r/min. Microscopy revealed an average microcapsule size of 52. 4 µm. Pharmacological studies showed that GPMC exhibited excellent therapeutic effects, such as expectorant activity, cough relieving and anti-inflammatory effect.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is a study of {{certain aspects of the}} surface chemistry of materials used as co-reactants in <b>carbonless</b> <b>copying</b> <b>paper</b> and of some materials which show promise for such a use. The areas investigated include the ion exchange characteristics of acid activated clays, the reactivity of a primary dye, Crystal Violet Lactone(CVL), on a range of activated aluminas, an investigation of the Lewis and Brønsted acid characteristics of transition metal ion exchanged clays and the effectiveness of aluminosilicate materials in catalysing inorganic ligand substitution reactions. Activated aluminas are shown to outperform acid activated clays as developers for CVL, with the effectiveness increasing with activation temperature up to 500 °C. In addition, unlike the acid activated clays, no shift in the X., is observed during the fading process. Pyridine was used as a probe of the acid characteristics of an intact and an acid activated clay exchanged with Al 3, Cu 21, Ni 2 and Cr 3 ions., with FTIR, NvR and thermal analysis being used to investigate the adsorbed state.

40|$|The colour formers used in <b>carbonless</b> <b>copying</b> <b>paper</b> {{consist of}} {{admixtures}} of {{primary and secondary}} dyes. Work {{was carried out in}} this programme both on retarding the photofading of the primary dyes and on improving the reactivity of the clay minerals towards the development of the secondary dye. The photolytic fading behaviour of S primary dyes were examined both in solution and on solid clay surfaces, and the intermediacy of singlet oxygen in the fading processes of the dyes examined by the DPBF trapping method. The retardation of dye fading was accomplished using bis(dithiocarbamato) nickel(II) complexes and it was found that some hydroxy-possessing species conferred improved photo-stability upon the developed dyes, especially towards fluorans, and to a lesser degree towards phthalides. The dark development of carbazolyl blue was examined on a series of cation exchanged and acid activated clays. There appeared to be two main mechanisms governing S-RB development in the dark; the first was catalysis by co-ordination to the Lewis acid sites on the clay edges, whilst the second was a redox process probably associated with the Fe 3 cations present in the clays. Several treatments were applied to modify common commercial days. It was found that introducing Fe 3 and Cu 2 into the clay profoundly improved the reactivity of the day to the secondary leuco dye. Cation exchange of clay with some transition metal ions such as CO 2 and Ni 2 also showed a beneficial effect on the colour formation. The Langmuir isotherm type plots were used to examine cation adsorption behaviour for 9 types of montmorillonite clays. It was found that cation exchange of clay occurs at at least two different sites; the tetrahedral silica layer sites and the intact montmorillonite interlayer cation exchange sites. It was also found that the silica layer sites are the predominant ones responsible for S-RB development, with interlayer sites providing a much lesser contribution. Adsorption of aquated metal salts makes virtually no further contributions to the leuco dye reaction...|$|R

40|$|Essential {{oils and}} {{extracts}} of various species of edible and medicinal plants, herbs, and spices constitute very potent biological active agents. They have a complex composition, containing {{from a few}} to several hundred constituents, mainly hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds. Both, hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds are responsible for odors and flavors, generated by aromatic plants as secondary metabolites (Ebrahimi et al., 2008). Clove oil (CO) is an essential oil contained in the dried flower buds, leaves and stem of the tree Syzygiu aromaticum (Eastern Hemisphere) or Eugenia caryophyllata and Eugenia aromaticum (Western hemisphere) (Schmid, 1972). It {{has been used for}} centuries as an anesthetic for toothaches, headaches and joint pain (Shelef, 1983; Soto et al., 1995). Clove has received attention as an ideal fish anesthetic (Ackerman et al., 2002; Wagner et al., 2003; Hoskonen and Pirhonen, 2004; Roubach et al, 2005) and it {{has been used as a}} fragrant and flavoring agent in a variety of food and cosmetic products (Atsumi et al., 2001; Fujisawa et al., 2002., Ito et al., 2005). Eugenol (EG) (4 -allyl- 2 -methoxyphenol) is the principal constituent of the essential CO, accounting for 90 - 95 % of the total oil amount (Briozzo et al., 1989; Gulcin et al., 2010). It has a strong phenolic smell and sharp acrid taste (Mouchreck, 2000; Ozturz et al., 2005). This phenolic compound has shown several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory activity, analgesic activity, anti-oxidative activity and anti-bacterial activity. In the food industry, clove is often used in the form of ground, extracted essential oil or oleoresin, but always in a small amount due to its intense flavour. However, the use of CO could be a problem in industrial applications due to its high volatility and low stability. Hence, irritation the mucosa and skin, pungent taste, volatility, light sensitivity and poor water solubility make it unsuitable to use as such. Considering the effectiveness and convenience of the application of essential CO and its main compound EG, the introduction of these compounds into food and cosmetic products has many challenges. These food ingredients are susceptible of degradation due to environmental stress conditions such as temperature, humidity, light, oxygen, interaction with other food ingredients and volatility of the aromatic compounds. Encapsulation is the technique by which one material or a mixture of materials is coated with or entrapped within another material or system. The coated material is called active or core material, and the coating material is called shell, wall material, carrier or encapsulant. The development of microencapsulation products started in the 1950 s with the research on pressure-sensitive coatings for the manufacture of <b>carbonless</b> <b>copying</b> <b>paper</b> (Green and Scheicher, 1955). Encapsulation technology is now well developed and accepted within the pharmaceutical, chemical, cosmetic, foods and printing industries (Augustin et al., 2001; Heinzen, 2002). In food products, fats and oils, aromatic compounds and oleoresins, vitamins, minerals, colorants and enzymes have been encapsulated (Dziezak, 1988; Jackson and Lee, 1991; Shahidi and Han, 1993). The simplest form of microcapsules may consist of a core surrounded by a wall of uniform or non-uniform thickness. The core material may be composed of just one or several distinct types of ingredients whereas the carrier could be single or multilayered. The microcapsules are generally additives to a larger system and must be adapted to that system. Consequently, there are a number of performance requirements placed on microcapsules. A limited number of encapsulating methods exist (Versic, 1988) (Figure VI. 1. 1), but an enormous range of di¿erent materials can be used including proteins, carbohydrates (CDs, MDs, gums) and lipids (Brazel, 1999). The choice of wall materials depends upon a number of factors including: expected product objectives and requirements; nature of the core material; process of encapsulation; economics and whether the coating material is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (US) or European Food Safety Authority (Europe) (Amrita et al., 1991) Being aware of the problems associated with the use of essential CO and its main compound EG, the aim of this study was using encapsulation as a tool in order to protect these sensitive bioactive compounds from degradation, eliminating unwanted effects and improving the effectiveness of their use in the industry.
