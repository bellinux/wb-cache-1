5|$|Nelson owns Luck, Texas, a {{ranch in}} Spicewood, Texas, and also lives in Maui, Hawaii with several celebrity neighbors.While {{swimming}} in Hawaii in 1981, Nelson's lung collapsed. He {{was taken to}} the Maui Memorial Hospital and his scheduled concerts were canceled. Nelson temporarily stopped smoking cigarettes each time his lungs became congested, and resumed when the congestion ended. He was then smoking between two and three packs per day. After suffering from pneumonia several times, he decided to quit either marijuana or tobacco. He chose to quit tobacco. In 2008 he started to smoke marijuana with a carbon-free system to avoid the effects of smoke. In 2004 Nelson underwent surgery for <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome,</b> as he had damaged his wrists by continuously playing the guitar. On the recommendation of his doctor, he canceled his scheduled concerts and only wrote songs during his recovery. In 2012 he canceled a fund-raising appearance in the Denver area. He suffered from breathing problems due to high altitude and emphysema and was taken to a local hospital. His publicist Elaine Schock confirmed soon after that Nelson's health was good and that he was heading to his next scheduled concert in Dallas, Texas. After repeated instances of pneumonia and emphysema through the years, Nelson underwent stem-cell therapy in 2015 to improve the state of his lungs.|$|E

25|$|There are few {{disorders}} on {{the differential}} diagnosis for <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Cervical radiculopathy can be mistaken for <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> since it can also cause abnormal or painful sensations in the hands and wrist. In contrast to <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome,</b> the symptoms of cervical radiculopathy usually begins in the neck and travels down the affected arm and may be worsened by neck movement. Electromyography and imaging of the cervical spine can help to differentiate cervical radiculopathy from <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> if the diagnosis is unclear. <b>Carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> is sometimes applied as a label to anyone with pain, numbness, swelling, and/or burning in the radial side of the hands and/or wrists. When pain is the primary symptom, <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{is unlikely to be}} the source of the symptoms. As a whole, the medical community is not currently embracing or accepting trigger point theories due to lack of scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|Other {{causes of}} this {{condition}} include intrinsic factors that exert pressure within the tunnel, and extrinsic factors (pressure exerted {{from outside the}} tunnel), which include benign tumors such as lipomas, ganglion, and vascular malformation. <b>Carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> often {{is a symptom of}} transthyretin amyloidosis-associated polyneuropathy and prior <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> surgery is very common in individuals who later present with transthyretin amyloid-associated cardiomyopathy, suggesting that transthyretin amyloid deposition may cause <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{observed}} {{a case of}} anaphylaxis which was induced by the injection of nafamostat masilate in a patient undergoing long-term maintenance of hemodialysis. The 62 -year-old male had been receiving hemodialysis for 20 years because of chronic glomer- ulonephrits. This patient also suffered from renal osteodystrophy for the last 3 years, and had undergone 5 operations for bone fracture or <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndromes.</b> During surgery, nafamostat masilate was used instead of heparin sodium to avoid bleeding, and no problems occurred with respect to continuation of hemodialysis. However, anaphylaxis appeared during injection of nafamostat masilate at a dental extraction on April 17 and accompanying a thigh contusion with hematoma on August 23, 1996. The anaphylaxis was clinically more severe on August 23. The results of a lymphocyte stimulation test for nafamostat masilate were positive. There were no other factors present that might have induced hypotension (heart failure, antihypertensive drug therapy, anemia, inappropriate dry weight, etc.). We therefore report this as a case of acquired allergy to nafamostat masilate during long-term maintenance of hemodialysis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundAuthors have {{reported}} better outcomes, by reducing surgical dissection for <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndromes</b> requiring surgery. Recently, a new sonographically guided technique for ultra minimally invasive (Ultra-MIS) <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> release (CTR) through 1 mm incision has been described. HypothesisWe hypothesized that {{a clinical trial}} for comparing Ultra-MIS versus Mini-open <b>Carpal</b> <b>Tunnel</b> Release (Mini-OCTR) was feasible. Materials and methodsTo test our hypothesis, we conducted a pilot study for studying Ultra-MIS versus Mini-OCTR respectively performed through a 1 mm or a 2 cm incision. We defined success if primary feasibility objectives (safety and efficacy) as well as secondary feasibility objectives (recruitment rates, compliance, completion, treatment blinding, personnel resources and sample size calculation for the clinical trial) could be matched. Score for Quick-DASH questionnaire at final follow-up was studied as the primary variable for the clinical trial. Turnover times were studied for assessing learning curve stability. ResultsForty patients were allotted. Primary and secondary feasibility objectives were matched with the following occurrences: 70. 2 % of eligible patients finally recruited; 4. 2 % of randomization refusals; 26. 6 patients/month recruited; 100 % patients receiving a blinded treatment; 97. 5 % compliance and 100 % completion. A sample size of 91 patients was calculated for clinical trial validation. At final follow-up, preliminary results for Quick-Dash substantially favored Ultra-MIS over Mini-OCTR (average 14. 54 versus 7. 39) and complication rates were lower for Ultra-MIS (5 % versus 20 %). A stable learning curve was observed for both groups. ConclusionsThe clinical trial is feasible. There is currently no evidence to contraindicate nor withhold the use of Ultra-MIS for CTR.

40|$|AbstractElders mostly {{suffer from}} degeneration, which causes {{problems}} {{of their daily}} lives. Aging has become a big issue of scientific researches nowadays. Elders mostly live alone or alone with their spouse. Since they prefer cooking themselves to eating out, cooking still {{plays an important role}} of their lives. Associated with high temperature, cooking behaviours are known to be high-risk tasks in our houses. Heavy kitchenware may also enhance the risk of suffering from <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndromes.</b> With the lost of muscle mass and the cognitive degeneration, it will be far more dangerous for elders work in the kitchen. Morphological functional innovation is a method combined with functional innovation and morphological chart. The process of this method is to analyse functions of current products, and then re-compose these functions by morphological chart after adding expected new functions. Solutions were filtered by the method Analysis of Interconnected Decision Areas (AIDA), and use Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to chose the final solution. For the result, a glove, wristband and elbow band composes this wearing aid system. In this wearing aid system, we reformed the glove by adding ribbons, so as to imitate the muscle structure of our palm and forearm in an easy way. Our idea is to make a wearing system that has the same function with our hand muscles. Similar to the “exoskeleton” concept, our design is pretty much like an “exomuscle” system. In this research, we have also evaluated our wearing aid system. We determine the difference before and after wearing our system by collecting and analysing the EMG data. Experiments have shown that our exomuscle system does have some effects. The results show that the difference before and after wearing the exomuscle system is significant, and mutual effect happened. We have collected data from biceps, flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and flexor carpi radialis (FCR), and after wearing the aid system, the loading of FDS and Biceps reduces while the loading of FCR increases. The loading decrease of FDS tells us that the aid certainly helps grip power, and the loading increase of FCR reveals that it may cause more ulnar deviation...|$|R
40|$|AIM: After the {{surgical}} decompression of the transverse carpal ligament as {{treatment of the}} <b>tunnel</b> <b>carpal</b> <b>syndrome,</b> pillar pain manifestation is possible. This is a painful and temporary invaliding syndrome with unknown aetiology. Aim {{of the study is}} to demonstrate that pillar pain is based on autonomic irritation that disappears with simple infiltration of local anaesthetic (LA), or rather by neuromodulation. METHODS: Eighty-four patients were enrolled for this study and underwent an open release technique surgery. They were then asked for regular postoperative follow-ups. RESULTS: Thirty-two out of 84 patients (38 %) developed pillar pain. Accordingly, injection of LA as pain treatment has since been studied and results compared with the conventional protocol for this painful syndrome. CONCLUSION: Even if the number of the patients considered is not great, there is evidence of a decrement of pillar pain by means of LA injections. Excellent functional outcomes and satisfaction were achieved using LA infiltrations for pillar pain after <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> decompression. The minimally invasive technique offers a quick, easy, effective, and inexpensive method useful to minimize and cure in a few days the pillar pain...|$|R

40|$|Background and PurposezzCarpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> (CTS) is {{the most}} common entrap-ment neuropathy. Although its {{etiology}} is unknown, certain conditions are commonly asso-ciated with CTS, such as obesity, arthritis, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, trauma, mass lesions, amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis. We aimed to determine the association between meta-bolic syndrome and CTS, and we compared the severity of CTS between patients with diabe-tes (and no concomitant metabolic syndrome) and patients with metabolic syndrome. MethodszzTwo hundred patients with a clinically and electrophysiological confirmed diag-nosis of CTS were included in the study. Their demographic characteristics and severity of CTS were analyzed according to the presence or the absence of metabolic syndrome. Differ-ences in the electrophysiological findings were evaluated between the following four groups: 1) metabolic syndrome alone (n= 52), 2) diabetes alone (n= 20), 3) combined metabolic syn-drome and diabetes (n= 44), and 4) no metabolic syndrome or diabetes (n= 84). ResultszzCTS was more severe in the patients with metabolic syndrome than those without this syndrome. The electrophysiological findings were worse in patients with metabolic syn-drome alone than in those with diabetes alone and those without diabetes and metabolic syndrome. ConclusionszzCTS appears to be more severe in patients with metabolic syndrome than patients with diabetes. Diabetes is one of the well-known risk factors for CTS, but other com-ponents of metabolic syndrome may have a greater effect on the severity of CTS.

25|$|As a note, {{a patient}} with true <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> (entrapment of the median nerve within the carpal tunnel) will not have any sensory loss over the thenar {{eminence}} (bulge of muscles {{in the palm of}} hand and {{at the base of the}} thumb). This is because the palmar branch of the median nerve, which innervates that area of the palm, branches off of the median nerve and passes over the carpal tunnel.

40|$|Although <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{release is}} one of the most {{commonly}} performed procedures in the USA, the morphology of the <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> as determined previously in the literature has been questioned.

The purpose of this study was to perform a morphological analysis of the <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> and correlate <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> and hand dimensions. The <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnels</b> of ten cadaveric specimens were emptied of their contents and a silicone cast of the <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> was then created. This cast was then digitized, and the dimensions of the <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> were calculated. These dimensions were compared with the measured hand dimensions of the specimens. The width, depth, tilt angle, length, cross-sectional area, and volume of the <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> were 19. 2  ±  1. 7  mm, 8. 3  ±  0. 9  mm, 14. 8  ±  7. 8 °, 12. 7  ±  2. 5  mm, 134. 9  ±  23. 6  mm 2, and 1, 737  ±  542  mm 3, respectively. Width, depth, and cross-sectional area did not change significantly along the length of the <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel,</b> but tilt angle did.

40|$|Background Regular {{exposure}} to hand-arm vibration {{can lead to}} hand-arm vibration (HAVS) and <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> (CTS) <b>syndromes.</b> EU Directive 2002 / 44 /EC, which aims to improve surveillance and reduce {{exposure to}} vibration at work, defines exposure limits for hand-arm-vibration. The aim is to investigate whether the staged implementation of the directive since 2005 {{has been associated with}} a change in the incidence of HAVS or CTS in European countries. To model the range of potential outcomes of the intervention, we sought to define an exposure-risk relationship based on the best available prospective longitudinal data for exposed workers. Methods In a series of studies, which have been subject of previous publications, 1, 2 forestry and stone workers were monitored at intervals of 1 to 5 years, on 1 to 4 occasions. Health status, annual hours of exposure and magnitude of vibration were recorded. In the present study, a novel analytical approach was applied to define a parametric survival function describing the incidence of HAVS as a function of various exposure metrics. Results Incidence of the vascular condition vibration-induced white finger was well described by a Weibull distribution with an increasing hazard rate. The resulting parametric equation reveals the role of duration of exposure and the vibration magnitude (m s- 2) relative to a threshold magnitude. Conclusion The exposure-risk relationship, which differs in some respects from the exposure relationship described in current standards (e. g.

40|$|Dear sir, one of {{the most}} common {{entrapment}} neuropathy syndromes in clinical practice is "Entrapment of median nerve in carpal tunnel" also called "Carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>syndrome</b> (CTS) " (Aydin et al., 2007; Huisstede et al., 2010). This syndrome is caused by entrapment of the median nerve in the wrist (Preston and Shapiro, 2005) when the pressure increases in the <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel.</b> A high division of the median nerve proximal to the <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel,</b> also known as a bifid median nerve, is a rare anatomic variation that may be associated with CTS and with persistent median vessels (Lanz, 1977). This anatomic variation has an incidence of 0, 8 % to 2, 3 % in patients with CTS. Lanz (1977) has characterized this anatomic condition of the median nerve in the <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel.</b> These anatomic variants have been classified into four groups: - Group 0 : extraligamentous thenar branch (standard anatomy); - Group 1 : variations of the course of the thenar branch; - Group 2 : accessory branches at the distal portion of the carpal tunnel; - Group 3 : divided or duplicated median nerve inside the carpal tunnel; - Group 4 : accessory branches proximal to the <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel.</b> During dissection of the wrist performed for the treatment of a CTS under local anesthesia, we found an anatomical variation of the median nerve that was divided in two branches inside the <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> (Group 3 of Lanz Classification) and in which its radial branch passed through its own compartment. The two parts of the nerve seems to be unequal in size (Fig. 1). Moreover the nerve passed in <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> associated with a median artery, so we classified this variation in the group 3 b of Lanz Classification (Fig. 2). The persistence of median artery coexisting with a bifid median nerve has been widely reported in surgical literature (Lanz, 1977; Barbe et al., 2005). Before surgical intervention clinical evaluation of patient and electrophysiological examination showed no differences compared to a non bifid median nerve entrapment syndrome. In conclusion the bifid median nerve may facilitate compression of median nerve in the <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> because of its increased cross sectional area even if it has no electrophysiological or clinical differential diagnosis in case of CTS. The aim of this letter is aware the physicians in order to borne in mind the possible presence of a median nerve variation during dissection of <b>carpal</b> <b>tunnel</b> in order to avoid the damage of this non common anatomical structures...|$|R
