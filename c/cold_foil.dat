50|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>foil</b> {{printing}}, {{also known}} as <b>cold</b> <b>foil</b> stamping, is a modern method of printing metallic foil on a substrate {{in order to enhance}} the aesthetic of the final product. <b>Cold</b> <b>foil</b> printing can be done two ways: the older dry lamination process common in the offset printing industry, or the newer, more versatile wet lamination process, which is dominant in the flexo label industry.|$|E
50|$|As the <b>cold</b> <b>foil</b> market evolves, {{major players}} in the {{printing}} industry are finding ways to make the process even more cost-effective. By indexing <b>cold</b> <b>foil,</b> printers can reduce foil waste, reduce their presses' downtime, and in turn maximize their presses' efficiency.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cold</b> Form <b>Foil</b> film {{is made of}} a 3-layer laminate: PVC/Aluminum/Polyamide. The PVC side is on {{the inside}} {{in contact with the}} product.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of cold forming, an aluminum-based {{laminate}} film is simply pressed into a mold {{by means of a}} stamp. The aluminum will be elongated and maintain the formed shape. In the industry these blisters are called <b>cold</b> form <b>foil</b> (CFF) blisters. The principal advantage of <b>cold</b> form <b>foil</b> blisters is that the use of aluminum offers a near complete barrier for water and oxygen, allowing an extended product expiry date. The principal disadvantages of <b>cold</b> form <b>foil</b> blisters are: the slower speed of production compared to thermoforming; the lack of transparency of the package (a therapy compliance disadvantage); and the larger size of the blister card (aluminum can not be formed with near 90 degree angles).In cold forming aluminium is offering a near complete barrier for water and oxygen, allowing an extended product expiry date.|$|R

50|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>foil</b> {{takes the}} idea of hot foil {{stamping}} and makes it more convenient and cost-effective. The <b>cold</b> <b>foil</b> functions like an additional ink and is actually a UV-curable, very fast lamination adhesive and can be bonded in-line in a single run using a printing plate for either flexographic web printing or offset sheet-fed printing. It can be applied precisely with high resolution, even for fine structures such as raster gradients and thin lines. Typeface is legible from about 5 points upwards and has excellent edge definition. <b>Cold</b> <b>foil</b> printing needs smooth surface substrates for excellent image quality.|$|E
50|$|Once printed, {{the surface}} of <b>cold</b> <b>foil</b> images may be varnished, laminated, or {{encapsulated}} {{in order to provide}} a hard-wearing, durable surface.|$|E
50|$|Some {{printing}} substrates are {{unsuitable for}} <b>cold</b> <b>foil</b> transfer. The best results are obtained on glossy coated papers and papers {{with a smooth}} surface. Weights from about 80 to 500 g/m^2 are possible.|$|E
40|$|Ni_ 3 Al thin foils with 315 to 357 μm {{thickness}} {{were successfully}} fabricated by cold rolling. X-ray pole figures showed {{the formation of}} { 110 } rolling textures with various rolling directions in the <b>foils</b> <b>cold</b> rolled over 83 % reduction. The deformation microstructure consists of fine slip traces and coarse and wavy shear bands. Banded deformation structure was observed in some foils. In the <b>foils</b> <b>cold</b> rolled to 83 % reduction, the Vickers hardness number reached over 600 and the ultimate tensile strength over 1. 7 GPa, irrespective of rolling texture and deformation microstructure. The <b>cold</b> rolled <b>foils</b> showed no tensile elongation, but {{it was possible to}} bend the foils. The foils recrystallized at temperatures over 1273 K had some tensile ductility (3. 0 to 14. 6 %), though the polycrystalline Ni_ 3 Al is known to be brittle due to severe grain boundary fracture. Electron backscatter diffraction measurements revealed that the large amount of total grain boundary area consists of low angle (LAB) and ∑ 3 coincidence lattice boundaries. This large fraction is probably a chief cause of the observed ductility...|$|R
40|$|The {{acceleration}} of protons, induced by electrons {{generated by a}} short-pulse laser, is experimentally investigated when varying {{the density of the}} plasma target the laser is interacting with. The experimental results are compared with particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations for which the target conditions are inferred from hydrodynamic simulations. High-energy protons are observed only for the two extreme configurations, namely solid-density foils and near-critical-density plasmas having large gradients. <b>Cold</b> solid <b>foils,</b> however, yield the highest energy protons and best proton beam profiles. As suggested by simulations, near-critical-density plasmas could be optimized to further increase the proton energy...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>foil</b> is most {{commonly}} used on products that call for a strong [...] "shelf appeal", such as household consumables, cigarette cartons, wine labels, and cosmetic packaging. It provides a luxurious metallic look on higher added-value label applications.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>foil</b> {{evolved from}} hot foil {{stamping}}. Hot foil stamping is mostly used offline when foil is required on a preprinted substrate, {{such as in}} the manufacture of greeting cards and special occasion ribbons. Hot foil is economical but very slow. The types of graphics that can be applied are usually limited to text and bold images. Hot foil is not usable with heat-sensitive substrates such as polyethylene, vinyl, or shrink film.|$|E
50|$|Using a {{standard}} printing plate, an image is printed onto a substrate {{with the use}} of a ultraviolet-curable <b>cold</b> <b>foil</b> adhesive. An ultraviolet dryer then cures the adhesive, which becomes tacky. Foil spools from an unwind and is nipped to a substrate. Foil sticks to the tacky adhesive on the substrate, and an image with a bright foil surface is created. Foil that does not adhere to the adhesive remains on a thin polyester liner, and waste is directed to a rewind spool. Because the adhesive is applied on press like a conventional ink, no expensive stamping die has to be created.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Copper <b>foils</b> <b>cold</b> {{rolled up}} to 92 % {{reduction}} exhibited a low {{intensity of the}} β-fiber texture and a high intensity of the cube and RD (rolling direction) -rotated cube components. After annealing, the recrystallization texture of the foils could be characterized by the mixture of the cube and the S components. An initial strong cube texture with a large grain size might remain a less developed rolling texture component, cube or RD-rotated cube, {{which would be the}} source of the S component in the recrystallization texture...|$|R
40|$|Severe plastic {{deformation}} routes (SPD) {{have been shown}} to be attractive for short time preparation of magnesium alloys for hydrogen storage, generating refined microstructures and interesting hydrogen storage properties when compared to the same materials processed by high-energy ball milling (HEBM), but with the benefit of higher air resistance. In this study, we present results of a new processing route for Mg alloys for hydrogen storage: rapid solidification followed by cold work. A Mg 97 Ni 3 alloy was processed by melt spinning (MS) and by extensive cold rolling (CR). Submitting Mg 97 Ni 3 ribbons between steel plates to cold rolling has shown to be a viable procedure, producing a thin <b>cold</b> welded <b>foil,</b> with little material waste. The as-processed material presents a high level of [002] fiber texture, a sub microcrystalline grain structure with a high density of defects, and also a fine dispersion of Mg 2 Ni nanoparticles. This refined microstructure allied to the developed texture resulted in enhanced activation and H-sorption kinetics properties...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} roll bite {{behaviors in}} <b>cold</b> <b>foil</b> rolling process, a 2 D elasto-plastic finite model is established using FEM software ABAQUS. Contact pressure distribution and roll contour in roll bite are also presented, which demonstrate that foil rolling process {{is different from}} conventional strip rolling process. The contact area is composed of entry elastic zone, entry plastic zone, an extensive neutral zone, exit plastic zone and exit elastic zone. It conforms {{to the results of}} Fleck foil rolling theory. Elastic deformation and work hardening of foil in roll bite are taken into account. The effect of rolling parameters, such as friction coefficient, entry thickness and reduction rate on distribution of contact pressure and vertical displacement are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{parameters}} of proton beams accelerated by a high-intensity short pulse laser from a thin foil are studied for various small plasma gradients created on the rear-surface of the foil. Compared {{to the case}} of an initially <b>cold</b> <b>foil,</b> the proton beam maximum energy as well as the beam spectral slope reduce steadily when increasing the gradient scale length. The measurements are in good agreement with simulations. For future ion-driven Fast Ignition of fusion targets, multi-kJ PetaWatt laser pulses will induce target preheat due to the leading part of the laser pulse. Estimates of such preheat in these conditions suggest that it should modify by less than 10 % the ion beam parameters compared {{to the case of}} a unheated target...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Through-Process {{modelling}} (TPM) of microstructure evolution during thermo-mechanical {{processing of}} sheet produced from direct chill (DC) cast non-heat treatable aluminium alloys is discussed. In a companion paper [1] the upstream processes of casting and homogenisation were dealt with, whereas {{the present paper}} focuses on the downstream deformation and annealing steps. Some recent advances in relevant model development are reviewed, and the important microstructural descriptors and their interactions are outlined. Together with two application examples – coiling of hot strip, and <b>cold</b> rolling of <b>foil</b> – current knowledge gaps in theory and modelling capability are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|In <b>cold</b> strip or <b>foil</b> rolling, {{flatness}} {{control is}} an integral part of modern mill. This paper introduces two typical flatness control systems, pattern recognisation flatness control system and multivariable flatness control. It is found that the latter is effective and has wider application fields. The FEM models of its core parameters, flatness actuator efficiency, are constructed. Influencing factors, such as the rolling force, bending force as well as the tilting force are discussed. Control strategies are proposed for foil rolling. The results demonstrate that the control strategies can reduce flatness error and improve flatness quality. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- The {{resulted}} <b>cold</b> laminated aluminum <b>foil</b> is {{rolled in}} bales; the foil is then unrolled and rewound in rolls with some imposed parameters: the exterior {{diameter of the}} roll, the length and mass of the rewound foil. These parameters must be measured with imposed precision and during the technological process. The paper presents a measurement method that solves this practical problem in the aluminum processing industry; the method {{is based on the}} pulses generated by two rotary incremental encoders and an IBM-PC compatible computer displays the measured values, enables the parameter prescribing and assures a simple dialog with the user. An error analysis is also presented; it enables the estimation of the maximum probable absolute error for each parameter.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{cold-rolled}} T 2 copper foils {{with the}} thickness of 50 um were chosen. The foils were annealed at different temperatures, namely, 250 ℃, 350 ℃, 450 ℃, 550 ℃, respectively. Micro deep drawing experiments on cold-rolled foils and annealed foils by laser driven flyer were achieved in order to investigate annealing effects on the formability of T 2 copper foil. The forming depth and material flow uniformity of the workpiece at different conditions were compared and analyzed. The test results showed that: (1) The workpiece of <b>cold</b> –rolled <b>foil</b> indicates poor neutral, non-uniform material flow, smaller forming depth, it is due to that the microstructures of cold-rolled foil are fiber organizations, which leads to poor plastic deformation capacity. (2) Annealing can significantly improve the formability of the foil. In the first stage: 250 - 350 ℃, recovery and recrystallization occurred in succession {{in the organization of}} the raw material, fibrous tissue transformed into equiaxed grains, the residual stress is greatly reduced, thus, the plastic deformation capacity is recovered. The forming depth is also significantly improved, increasing by about twice. In the second stage: 350 - 450 ℃, the enhanced formability is relative to the surface layer effect, which is also a reflection of micro-scale effect. This study provided a theoretical and experimental guidance for the practical application of micro deep drawing process by laser driven flyer...|$|R
40|$|The work {{described}} in this paper {{for the first time}} deals with the production of SMA microcomponents with stress-optimized geometries by microstructuring out of a <b>cold</b> rolled <b>foil</b> and a sputtered film, and a combination with structured plastics components. In addition to the design of SMA drives, also suitable buildup and joining techniques for the SMA actuators are examined. Three different SM alloys are used for actuator development, some of them developed in cooperation with the manufacturers: Cold-rolled foils of NiTi- 50. 3 at. % with an initial thickness of 157 #mu#m, NiTi- 50 at. % with a thickness of 100 #mu#m, and sputtered NiTi films with a thickness of 8 #mu#m.

40|$|A {{two-phase}} Mg- 9 Li alloy (where {{the composition}} is in weight per cent) was made fine grained (d≈ 6 – 35 μm) by extensive <b>cold</b> rolling into <b>foils</b> and press bonding the foils at low homologous temperatures. The material exhibited superplastic {{properties in the}} temperature range 423 – 523 K ((0. 49 – 0. 61) T/Tm) with elongations to failure as high as 460 %. The creep rate {{was determined to be}} inversely proportional to approximately the square of grain size and to the second power of stress. The activation energy for superplastic flow was equal to that for lattice diffusion in the major b. c. c. β phase. The Mg- 9 Li laminate alloy was found to be similar in its flow characteristics to MA- 21, a multicomponent Mg- 8. 1 Li fine-grained commercial Soviet alloy. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} deuterium {{retention and}} {{the onset of}} blistering, deuterium was implanted in <b>cold</b> rolled tungsten <b>foils</b> at fluences ranging from 3 [*]× 1020 to 3 [*]× 1022 D/m 2. Ion energies were 300 eV and 2000 eV {{in order to be}} below and above the tungsten theoretical damage energy threshold. While energy dependent phenomena were observed, blistering occurs regardless of ion energy. Both plastically and elastically deformed blisters were found, as manifest in before and after micrographs. The fraction of plastically deformed blisters did not saturate at the fluences used in these studies. However, the size of the largest blister that relaxed during TDS does saturate at ∼ 7 µm. A simple conceptual model is presented, which proposes that the deuterium released from elastically deformed blisters appears at ∼ 600 K in the thermal desorption spectra, which is consistent with large vacancy clusters...|$|R
40|$|Residuals of {{lubricants}} adhere as {{very thin}} layers of hydrocarbons to {{the surfaces of}} <b>cold</b> rolled aluminium <b>foil.</b> Subsequent processing of the foil requires a cleaning process. In this study, {{a new approach to}} degrease the aluminium is examined that employs an atmospheric pressure plasma treatment of the surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is used to detect hydrocarbon layers on the surface of aluminium foil. The detected carbon content {{is a measure of the}} amount of residual lubricants remaining on the surface. Before any treatment, the proportion of carbon on the foil surface amounts to 19 % corresponding to a lubricant layer thickness of 3 - 3 nm. Plasma degreasing reduces the carbon proportion to ~ 6 % corresponding to a layer thickness of 1 - 3 nm. With conventional heating, there is a layer thickness of ~ 1 nm remaining on the foil surface. Still, the plasma degreasing is a less time and energy consuming cleaning process...|$|R

40|$|Energy and angular {{distributions}} {{of the fast}} outgoing electron beam induced by the interaction of 1 - 2 J, 30 fs, 3 - 20 x 1018 W/cm 2 laser with a thin foil or a gas jet target are characterized by using both an electron spectrometer and Bremsstrahlung induced photo-nuclear reactions. The supra-thermic electron beams production was investigated for a solid target versus its thickness and its Z number, and for a gas jet target versus its pressure. Using a polyethylene target and a supersonic Helium gas jet target, we measured, respectively, up to 4 x 108 and 3 x 109 electrons produced per laser pulse, with energies up to, respectively, 60 MeV and 160 MeV. The associated Boltzmann temperature of these electrons is <b>colder</b> for thin <b>foils</b> (9 MeV) than for gas jet (18 MeV). About, respectively 0. 06 % and 1 % of the laser energy has been converted to outgoing electrons with energies above 5 MeV. Such electrons leave the plasma in the laser direction within a cone with an opening angle of, respectively, 2. 5 ° and 8. 5 °. We discuss the physical processes of electron acceleration. Numerical calculations show a good agreement with the experiments...|$|R
