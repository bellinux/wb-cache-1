50|$|The {{paravane}} {{weapon was}} developed by the British inventor Sir Dennistoun Burney as a means to sweep enemy mines. Towed behind a ship, the paravane wire would either cut the mine's mooring cable or bring the mine and paravane together, detonating the mine. There are offensive and defensive paravanes. There are main paravanes and auxiliary protector paravanes. Some paravanes are equipped with cable cutters that cut the moored mines. Explosive paravanes are essentially a towable or <b>controllable</b> <b>mine.</b> The US Department of Defense continues to have interest in paravanes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{large number}} of data mining methods are, as such, not {{applicable}} to fast, intuitive, and interactive use. Thus, {{there is a need}} for visually <b>controllable</b> data <b>mining</b> methods. Such methods should comply with three major requirements: their model structure can be represented visually, they can be controlled using visual interaction, and they should be fast enough for visual interaction. We define a framework for using data mining methods in interactive visualization. These data mining methods are called “visually controllable ” and combine data mining with visualization and user-interaction, bridging the gap between data mining and visual analytics. Our main objective is to define the interactive visualization scenario and the requirements for visually <b>controllable</b> data <b>mining.</b> Basic data mining algorithms are reviewed and it is demonstrated how they can be controlled visually.

Such methods should comply with three major requirements: their model structure can be represented visually, they can be controlled using visual, interaction, and they should be fast enough for visual interaction.

These data mining methods are called, ``visually controllable'' and combine data mining with visualization, and user-interaction, bridging the gap between data mining and, visual analytics. Our main objective is to define the interactive, visualization scenario and the requirements for visually, <b>controllable</b> data <b>mining.</b> Basic data mining algorithms are reviewed, and it is demonstrated how they can be controlled visually. We also discuss how existing visual analytics tools fit to the proposed framework., From a data mining perspective, this work creates a reference framework for, designing and evaluating visually controllable algorithms and visual analytics systems...|$|R
40|$|Coal seam gas {{drainage}} {{is affected by}} many factors which may be generally divided into two groups, geological factors and operational factors. Studies conducted in the Bulli seam found geological factors had a dominant impact on coal seam {{gas drainage}} while operational factors had a secondary impact, affecting the amount of optimum gas drainage performance achieved within the limitations imposed by the prevailing geological conditions. Various operational factors, which are <b>controllable</b> by the <b>mine</b> operator and which {{have a significant impact}} on gas drainage effectiveness, are presented and recommendations made to improve and optimise gas drainage performance...|$|R
