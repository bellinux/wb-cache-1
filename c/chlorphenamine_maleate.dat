50|$|The {{halogenated}} alkylamine antihistamines all exhibit optical isomerism, and chlorphenamine in {{the indicated}} products is racemic <b>chlorphenamine</b> <b>maleate,</b> whereas dexchlorphenamine is the dextrorotary stereoisomer.|$|E
50|$|Chlorphenamine (INN), {{also called}} {{chlorpheniramine}} (USAN and former BAN), aka CP commonly marketed {{in the form}} of <b>chlorphenamine</b> <b>maleate,</b> is a first-generation alkylamine antihistamine used in the prevention of the symptoms of allergic conditions such as rhinitis and urticaria. Its sedative effects are relatively weak compared to other first-generation antihistamines. Chlorphenamine {{is one of the most}} commonly used antihistamines in small-animal veterinary practice. Although not generally approved as an antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication, chlorphenamine appears to have these properties as well.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} several mathematical {{approaches for}} simultaneous determination of dibucaine (D) and <b>chlorphenamine</b> <b>maléate</b> (CM). The different calibration methods utilised were: first derivative spectrophotometry (FDS), classical least squares (CLS), regression of partial least squares (PLS), and {{principal components regression}} (PCR). For the multivariated methods, the limits of detection (LOD) for multivariate calibrations were determined creating a surrogate signal variable (SSV). The recoveries were selected to confirm {{the validity of the}} models. In general, the CLS model presents the poorest recovery. In order to compare the exactitude of the different calibration methods, a one-way ANOVA test was performed. In these analyses, only the CLS calibration method produced a significantly different prediction. The lowest LODs were achieved by CLS and FDS, although the former method presented lower precision and poor prediction. Therefore, the FDS method is proposed as a pure binary calibration method for D-CM mixed samples, including the prepared according to a medical prescription and plasma samples simulating an event of intoxication...|$|E
40|$|Orthogonal design (OD) was {{employed}} to optimize the separation condition of flow injection-capillary electrophoresis (FI–CE). In order to compare the optimum condition, uniform design and univariate approach were also adopted. The influences of variables such as buffer pH, buffer concentration, acetonitrile (ACN) percentage, and separation voltage were discussed. The optimum separation condition was established. The limits of detection were 1. 94 × 10 – 2, 6. 40 × 10 – 3, 1. 16 × 10 – 2 and 1. 94 × 10 – 2 µg/mL for dextromethorphan hydrobromide (Dex), <b>chlorphenamine</b> hydrogen <b>maleate</b> (Chl), pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (Pse), and paracetamol (Par), respectively. The RSDs of peaks areas were less than 2. 0 %. The results showed the OD was an effective method among experimental designs for optimizing the separation conditions of CE. The optimum condition was used for separation and determination of Dex, Chl, Pse, and Par in cold medicines. The average recovery was between 96. 68 – 101. 25 %...|$|R
40|$|An open-tubular {{capillary}} electrochromatography column was prepared by chemically immobilized β-cyclodextrin modified gold nanoparticles onto new surface with the prederivatization of (3 -mercaptopropyl) -trimethoxysilane. The synthesized nanoparticles and the prepared column {{were characterized by}} transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy and ultraviolet visible spectroscopy. When the column was employed as the chiral stationary phase, no enantioselectivity was observed for ten model basic drugs. So β-cyclodextrin {{was added to the}} background electrolyte as chiral additive to expect a possible synergistic effect occurring and resulting in a better separation. Fortunately, significant improvement in enantioselectivity was obtained for ten pairs of drug enantiomers. Then, the effects of β-cyclodextrin concentration and background electrolyte pH on the chiral separation were investigated. With the developed separation mode, all the enantiomers (except for venlafaxine) were baseline separated in resolutions of 4. 49, 1. 68, 1. 88, 1. 57, 2. 52, 2. 33, 3. 24, 1. 63 and 3. 90 for zopiclone, <b>chlorphenamine</b> <b>maleate,</b> brompheniramine maleate, dioxopromethazine hydrochloride, carvedilol, homatropine hydrobromide, homatropine methylbromide, venlafaxine, sibutramine hydrochloride and terbutaline sulfate, respectively. Further, the possible separation mechanism involved was discussed...|$|E
40|$|The enantiomers {{separation}} of eight pharmaceutical racemates collected in Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2010 (Ch. P 2010), including nitrendipine, felodipine, omeprazole, praziquantel, sulpiride, clenbuterol hydrochloride, verapamil hydrochloride and <b>chlorphenamine</b> <b>maleate,</b> {{was performed on}} chiral stationary phase of amylose ramification by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on Chiralpak AD-H column and Chiralpak AS-H column with the mobile phase consisted of isopropanol and n-hexane. The detection wavelength and the flow rate were set at 254  nm and 0. 7  mL/min, respectively. The effects of proportion of organic additives, alcohol displacer and temperature on the separation were investigated. The results indicated that eight chiral drugs were separated on chiral stationary phase of amylase ramification in normal phase chromatographic system. The chromatographic retention and resolution of enantiomers were adjusted by factors, including the changes of the concentration of alcohol displacer in mobile phase, organic alkaline modifier and column temperature. It was shown that the resolution was improved with reducing concentration of alcohol displacer. When the concentration of organic alkaline modifier was 0. 2 %, the resolution and the peak shape were fairly good. Most racemates mentioned above had the best resolution at column temperature of 25  °C. The best temperature should be kept unchanged {{in the process of}} separation so as to obtain stable separation results...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (J. O. De Beer, C. V. Vandenbroucke and D. L. Massart, J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal., 12, (1994) 1379 - 1396) liquid chromatographic (LC) retention modelling of the cough-syrup compounds methyl para-hydroxybenzoate (MPHB) and propyl para-hydroxybenzoate (PPHB), phenylephrine hydrochloride (PE) and <b>chlorphenamine</b> <b>maleate</b> (CPM) was studied using a face-centred central composite design. It is examined whether smaller half-fractional and full factorial designs with fewer experiments tend to reliably predict retention {{times of the}} latter compounds as well. Simplified regression modelling, however, neglecting more first-order and interactive effects and disregarding pure second-order effects,, has to be set up. These smaller designs finally satisfy the prediction of the retention of MPHB, PPHB and PE also. Retention prediction of CPM is much less accurate. CPM has a pK(a) value of 4. 0, which is encompassed by the examined mobile phase pH limits 3. 9 and 5. 0. Since the largest retention shifts occur near the pK(a) value, retention prediction in this area becomes more complex. CPM retention modelling from a full factorial design is useful if the mobile phase pH is fixed at 5. 0 for methanol {{as well as for}} acetonitrile as organic modifers. The full factorial design, applied with acetonitrile as organic modifer. enables the selection of suitable LC parameter combinations for fast and complete separation of the four compounds in cough-syrup analysis...|$|E
