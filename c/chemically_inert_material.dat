In this study, cement pastes were designed keeping the sulphate content constant. Isothermal calorimetry was used to characterize the early-age behaviour. The results showed the influence of the mix design of cement pastes. Compressive strength tests, mercury intrusion porosimetry, thermogravimetry, and calorimetric measurements were carried out on mortars and cement pastes containing one of the three mineral additions. ESPFA had a <b>chemically</b> <b>inert</b> behaviour but the strength and thermogravimetric analyses showed their physical effect. The high specific surface of ESPFA actually leads to relatively good activity coefficient and enhanced portlandite formation.

30|$|It {{is not the}} {{intrinsic}} properties alone but the surface geometry also which serves in defining the properties for potential applications of materials. In spite of retaining the same chemical composition, nanostructured materials exhibit pronounced variations in the properties in comparison with their bulk and film forms. For instance, it has been demonstrated that diamond coatings on silicon nanostructures significantly reduce the turn-on field (E 0) of EFE [21, 22]. Processing of materials to a desired geometry will depend entirely on {{the intrinsic}} properties such as hardness, chemical and/or mechanical stability, etc., of the materials.

40|$|The {{search for}} hard {{materials}} {{to extend the}} working life of sharp tools is an age-old problem. In recent history, sharp tools must also often withstand high temperatures and harsh chemical environments.

Unfortunately, this combination is inherently contradictory, as mechanically strong, <b>chemically</b> <b>inert</b> <b>materials</b> tend {{to be difficult to}} fabricate with nanoscale fidelity. Here a novel process is described, whereby the surfaces of pre-existing, nanoscale Si tips are exposed to carbon ions and then annealed, to form a strong silicon carbide (SiC) layer. The nanoscale sharpness is largely preserved and the tips exhibit a wear resistance that is orders of magnitude greater than that of conventional silicon tips and at least 100 -fold higher than that of monolithic, SiO-doped diamond-like-carbon (DLC) tips.

40|$|Fluoropolymers {{are known}} as <b>chemically</b> <b>inert</b> <b>materials</b> with good high {{temperature}} resistance, so they are often the materials of choice for harsh chemical environments. These properties arise because the carbon-fluorine bond is the strongest of all bonds between other elements and carbon, and, because of their large size, fluorine atoms can protect the carbon backbone of polymers such as poly(tetrafluoroethylene), PTFE, from chemical attack. However, while the carbon-fluorine bond is much stronger than the carbon hydrogen bond, the G values for radical formation on high energy radiolysis of fluoropolymers are roughly {{comparable to those of}} their protonated counterparts. Thus, efficient high energy radiation grafting of fluoropolymers is practical, and this process can be used to modify either the surface or bulk properties of a fluoropolymer. Indeed, radiation grafted fluoropolymers are currently being used as separation membranes for fuel cells, hydrophilic filtration membranes and matrix substrate materials for use in combinatorial chemistry. Herein we present a review of recent studies of the high energy radiation grafting of fluoropolymers and of the analytical methods available to characterize the grafts. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The dynamic {{flow-through}} chamber {{system has}} been developed {{in response to a}} need to measure emissions of nitrogen, sulphur, and carbon compounds for a variety of field applications. The cylindrical chamber system is constructed of <b>chemically</b> <b>inert</b> <b>materials</b> and internally lined with 5 mil thick transparent fluorinated ethylene polypropylene (FEP) Teflon to reduce chemical reactions and build up of temperature inside the chamber. The chamber (diameter = 27 cm, height = 42 cm, volume = 24. 05 L) is designed with an open-ended bottom that can penetrate either soil or liquid to a depth of ~ 6 - 8 cm, thus creating a completely enclosed system. Carrier gas (e. g. compressed zero-grade air) is pumped at a constant flow rate (~ 2 to ~ 5 lpm), depending on the season. The air inside the chamber is well mixed by a variable-speed, motor-driven Teflon impeller (~ 40 to ~ 100 rpm). Many different laboratory and field experiments have been conducted using this dynamic chamber system. Oxides of nitrogen (NO, NO 2, NOy) emissions have been measured from agricultural soils where nitrogen-rich fertilizers have been applied. Ammonia-nitrogen (NH 3 -N) and reduced organic sulphur compounds emissions have been measured using this same technique across a gas-liquid interface at swine waste treatment anaerobic storage lagoons, and agricultural fields. Similar chamber systems have also been deployed to measure uptake of nitrogen, sulphur, ozone, and hydrogen peroxide gases by crops and vegetation to examine atmospheric-biospheric interactions.

40|$|International audienceThe disjunct eddy {{covariance}} (DEC) {{method is}} an interesting alternative to the conventional eddy covariance (EC) method because it allows the estimation of turbulent fluxes of species for which fast sensors are not available. We have developed and validated a new disjunct sampling system (called MEDEE). This system is built with <b>chemically</b> <b>inert</b> <b>materials.</b> Air samples are taken quickly and alternately in two cylindrical reservoirs, the internal pressures of which are regulated by a moving piston. The MEDEE system {{was designed to be}} operated either on the ground or aboard an aircraft. It is also compatible with most analysers since it transfers the air samples at a regulated pressure. To validate the system, DEC and EC measurements of CO 2 and latent heat fluxes were performed concurrently during a field campaign. EC fluxes were first compared to simulated DEC (SDEC) fluxes and then to actual DEC fluxes. Both the simulated and actual DEC fluxes showed a good agreement with EC fluxes in terms of correlation. The determination coefficients (R 2) were 0. 93 and 0. 91 for DEC and SDEC latent heat fluxes, respectively. For DEC and SDEC CO 2 fluxes R 2 was 0. 69 in both cases. The conditions of low fluxes experienced during the campaign impaired the comparison of the different techniques especially for CO 2 flux measurements. Linear regression analysis showed an 14 % underestimation of DEC fluxes for both CO 2 and latent heat compared to EC fluxes. A first field campaign, focusing on biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions, was carried out to measure isoprene fluxes above a downy oak (Quercus Pubescens) forest in the south-east of France.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Combination of two {{physical}} phenomena, {{capillary pressure}} gradient and wettability gradient, allows a simple two-step fabrication process that yields a reliable hydrophobic self-cleaning condenser surface. The surface is fabricated with specific microscopic topography and further treatment with a <b>chemically</b> <b>inert</b> low-surface-energy <b>material.</b> This process {{does not require}} growth of nanofeatures (nanotubes) or hydrophilic−hydrophobic patterning of the surface. Trapezoidal geometry of the microfeatures facilitates droplet transfer from the Wenzel to the Cassie state and reduces droplet critical diameter. The geometry of the micropatterns enhances local coalescence and directional movement for droplets with diameter {{much smaller than the}} radial length of the micropatterns. The hydrophobic self-cleaning micropatterned condenser surface prevents liquid film formation and promotes continuous dropwise condensation cycle. Upon dropwise condensation, droplets follow a designed wettability gradient created with micropatterns from the most hydrophobic to the least hydrophobic end of the surface. The surface has higher condensation efficiency, due to its directional self-cleaning property, than a plain hydrophobic surface. We explain the self-actuated droplet collection mechanism on the condenser surface and demonstrate experimentally the creation of an effective wettability gradient over a 6 mm radial distance. In spite of its fabrication simplicity, the fabricated surface demonstrates self-cleaning property, enhanced condensation performance, and reliability over time.

40|$|Abstract. The {{frictional}} {{behavior of}} sintered composite materials based on aluminum with high content of solid intermetallics and soft tin was investigated. It {{was found that}} at the moderate pressures and in absence of a liquid lubricant, both types of composites exhibit a low friction coefficient and good wear resistance. Intorduction Aluminium alloys are widely used as construction materials because they are characterized by high specific strength, ductility, good corrosion resistance and low cost [1]. Additionally, aluminum alloys have high thermal conductivity and inertness to lubricants. Therefore, they have properties that are required for materials used in friction units. However, examples of such application of these alloys are practically absent because of the tendency of aluminum to seizure with a steel counterbody in contact areas, where clean surface sites are appeared due to the oxide film destruction. A deformation of aluminum surface layers {{and the destruction of}} oxide films at the direct contact with a harder body can`t be avoided [2]. However, it is possible to change the type of contact, by making it through the antifriction layer of wear-resistant and <b>chemically</b> <b>inert</b> <b>material.</b> For example, the solid particles of refractory material can be placed on the aluminum surface.

40|$|Titanium-dioxide (TiO 2) is a low-cost, <b>chemically</b> <b>inert</b> <b>material</b> {{that became}} the basis of many modern {{applications}} ranging from, for example, cosmetics to photovoltaics. TiO 2 exists in three different crystal phases − Rutile, Anatase and, less commonly, Brookite − and, {{in most of the}} cases, the presence or relative amount of these phases are essential to decide the TiO 2 final application and its related efficiency. Traditionally, X-ray diffraction has been chosen to study TiO 2 and provides both the phases identification and the Rutile-to-Anatase ratio. Similar information can be achieved from Raman scattering spectroscopy that, additionally, is versatile and involves rather simple instrumentation. Motivated by these aspects this work took into account various TiO 2 Rutile+Anatase powder mixtures and their corresponding Raman spectra. Essentially, the method described here was based upon the fact that the Rutile and Anatase crystal phases have distinctive phonon features, and therefore, the composition of the TiO 2 mixtures can be readily assessed from their Raman spectra. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the suitability of Raman spectroscopy in estimating the concentration of Rutile or Anatase in TiO 2 and is expected to influence the study of TiO 2 -related thin films, interfaces, systems with reduced dimensions, and devices like photocatalytic and solar cells...|$|E

Main design features {{of our system}} are (a) highly transparent chamber walls consisting of <b>chemically</b> <b>inert</b> <b>material,</b> (b) individual purging flow units for each chamber, and (c) a movable lid for automated opening and closing of the chamber.

This guarantees a proven efficient mixing of the chamber volume and a fast equilibration after lid closing. The dynamic chamber system is able to measure emission as well as deposition fluxes of trace gases. For the latter case, the modification of the turbulent transport by the chamber (compared to undisturbed ambient conditions) is quantitatively described by a bulk resistance concept.

The results also demonstrated the importance of considering the chemical source/sink in the chamber due to gas phase reactions for the reactive compounds of the NO-NO 2 -O 3 triad.
