25|$|The {{more modern}} {{idea of a}} piece of a {{winemaking}} equipment used to extract the juice from the skins probably emerged during the Greco-Roman periods where written accounts by Cato the Elder, Marcus Terentius Varro, Pliny the Elder and others described wooden wine presses that utilized large beams, capstans and windlasses to exert pressure on the pomace. The wines produced by these presses were usually darker, with more color extracted from the skins but could also be more harsh with bitter tannins also extracted. That style of wine press would eventually evolve into the basket press used in the Middle Ages by wine estates of the nobility and Catholic Church leading to the modern tank batch <b>and</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>presses</b> used in wineries today.|$|R
2500|$|The {{benefits}} of <b>continuous</b> <b>presses</b> is the [...] "continuous" [...] sequence that allows {{large volumes of}} grapes to be pressed with minimum labor involvement. Instead of pressing separate batches {{that need to be}} emptied <b>and</b> refilled, <b>continuous</b> <b>press</b> typically have an input area and some mechanism (such as an auger screw or belt) that transfers the grapes through the pressings with an output area for the discarded cake. The throughput is limited by the capacity of the tank and the diameter of the screw or width of the belts. Many models of <b>continuous</b> screw <b>presses</b> can process from 50 to upwards of a 100 metric tonnes an hour. This can be a significant advantage for a high volume winery compared to batch presses that often only process 1 to 5 tonnes an hour.|$|R
2500|$|Wine presses are {{generally}} classified into two typesâ€”batch <b>and</b> <b>continuous.</b> Batch <b>presses</b> involve pressing a set amount (a [...] "batch") of grapes {{with the press}} needing to be emptied of the pomace or [...] "cake" [...] (the leftover skins, seeds and stems) between batches. There are many different styles of batch presses ranging from simple hand operated basket presses to computerized membrane presses and presses that are [...] "opened" [...] with oxygen able to {{come into contact with}} the must or [...] "enclosed" [...] in a tank that allows for anaerobic winemaking. <b>Continuous</b> <b>presses</b> use a helical screw (such as an auger) or belt that transports the grapes from a feed in across a cylindrical screen or between air pressured filled pads that presses the grapes, compacts the cakes and then removes the cake through an output all in one continuous operation.|$|R

40|$|Babassu (Orbignya sp.) is a palm with {{extraordinary}} socioeconomic and ecologic importance found in humid tropical areas in Brazil, especially in frequently burned and degraded landscapes. There are several uses for babassu oil; however, {{its potential for}} providing other industrial products remains unexploited, {{due to the lack}} of scale and production structure. Oil and presscake extracted from kernels are industrially produced, while the remaining parts of the babassu coconut have the potential to add value as byproducts. This study aimed to establish conditions for the preparation of the raw material fruit of babassu for oil extraction by pressing and producing biodiesel by ethanolic transesterification. Babassu coconuts were dried at 75 and 90 &# 176;C. The separation of the fractions rich in fiber, starch, kernel and mesocarp was performed in appropriate equipments. The starch content in the mesocarp fractions of babassu coconuts dried at 75 and at 90 &# 176;C were 54 and 56 %, respectively and lipids represented 65 % of the kernel. Oil and press cake were obtained through hydraulic <b>and</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>press,</b> biodiesel was produced and the quality of products was compared. The total of saturated fatty acid in babassu oil was between 78 and 82 %, and the total of unsaturated fatty acids that promote good oxidative stability in the oil was in the range of 17 to 20 %. Oil obtained by cold pressing extraction and its biodiesel had better results in terms of quality. The quality of oils is within the Codex standard and biodiesel from oil extracted by cold pressing had higher oxidative stability...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The level-ice forces exerted on a {{scale model}} of a {{compliant}} bottom founded structure are identified from non-collocated strain and acceleration measurements {{by means of a}} joint input-state estimation algorithm. The identification is performed based on two different finite element models: one entirely based on the blueprints of the structure, and an updated one which predicts the first natural frequency more accurately. Results are presented for two different excitation scenarios characterized by the ice failure process and ice velocity, and known as the intermittent <b>crushing</b> <b>and</b> the <b>continuous</b> brittle <b>crushing</b> regimes. The accuracy of the identified forces is assessed by comparing them with those obtained by a frequency domain deconvolution on the basis of experimentally obtained frequency response functions. Results show a successful identification of the level-ice forces for both the intermittent <b>and</b> <b>continuous</b> brittle <b>crushing</b> regimes, even when significant modeling errors are present. The ice-induced displacements of the structure identified in conjunction with the forces are also compared to those measured during the experiment. These are found {{to be sensitive to the}} modelling errors in the blueprint model. By a simple tuning of the model, however, the estimated response is seen to match the measured one with high accuracy.

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 A {{three-dimensional}} model based on fundamental principles to simulate heat and mass transfer and mat densification during hot pressing of wood-based composites is presented. Mechanisms {{included in the}} analysis are water vapor and air transfer by gas convection and molecular gas diffusion, conductive and convective heat transfer, and sorptive effects, as well as densification of the material and development of internal stresses. The implementation of the model enables one to simulate the local evolution of temperature, moisture content, vapor and air pressure, density and internal stresses, as well as overall heat and gas flow patterns. The model consists of a set of constitutive flux equations that are coupled by local energy and mass balances, combined with a one-dimensional rheological model. Nonlinear dependencies of the material and gas properties are accounted for. A particular modeling approach is developed and implemented to simulate the pressing process not only in batch but also in <b>continuous</b> <b>presses.</b> The numerical results of the model are in good agreement with those of experiments performed in a large-size laboratory <b>press</b> <b>and</b> an industrial <b>continuous</b> <b>press.</b> A small selection of topics important during hot pressing is given particular attention by means of model predictions. Among these are considerations of the importance of different heat transfer mechanisms and how they vary over space and time, and changes in gas composition inside the mat throughout the process. The model may be used in the future to optimize the manufacture of existing natural fiber composites and to aid in the development of new products and technology for their production...|$|R
40|$|To {{obtain the}} effect of {{velocity}} and structural natural frequency (structural stiffness) on ice failure, an extended dynamic Van der Pol based single degree-of-freedom ice-structure interaction model is developed. Three basic modes of response were reproduced: intermittent <b>crushing,</b> frequency lock-in <b>and</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>crushing.</b> Further analysis on physical mechanism of ice-structure interaction is presented {{on the basis of}} feedback mechanism and energy mechanism, respectively. Internal effect and external effect from ice and structure were both explained in the feedback branch. Based on reproduced results, energy exchanges at different configurations are computed from the energy conservation using the first law of thermodynamics. A general conclusion on the predominant type of vibration when the ice velocity increases during the interaction process is forced, self-excited and forced in each three modes of responses. Ice force variations also shows that there is more impulse energy during the lock-in range. Moreover, ice-induced vibration (IIV) demonstrates an analogy of friction-induced self-excited vibration. Finally, the similarity between strain-stress curve and Stribeck curve shows that static and kinetic friction force variations are attributed to ice force characteristic, and can be used to explain the lower effective pressure magnitude during continuous crushing than the peak pressure during intermittent crushing...|$|R
40|$|Mineral {{carbonation}} is {{a permanent}} and safe way for the sequestration of anthropogenic CO 2. Carbonation reactions of metal oxides- and hydroxides-bearing alkaline solid waste occur spontaneously at atmospheric temperature and pressure, but proceed slowly to obtain an industrial viable process. In order to enhance mineral carbonation it is necessary a careful selection of the process routes and the process conditions and to use pre-treatments that increase the material reactivity. Mechanical activation is a pre-treatment method that increases mineral dissolution rates due to particle size reduction, specific surface increase and structural disorder production. Many experiments were conducted by increasing the grinding time and the carbonation time of the selected materials (steelmaking slag, incinerator ashes and track ballast) to evaluate how increasing grinding time influences the carbonation rate. The two key factors for {{the selection of the}} materials for the laboratory tests were the presence of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals and the time of mechanical activation. A jaw <b>crusher</b> <b>and</b> a <b>continuous</b> ring mill were used to reduce the samples size and / or to obtain homogeneous samples, while a disc mill and a vario-planetary mill were used for mechanical activation. The chemical composition of the samples was determined with X-ray fluorescence, a simultaneous DSC / TGA analyzer was utilized to define the carbonate content, the CO 2 uptake and the calcium conversion efficiency and X-ray diffraction was used to determine the mineralogical composition of the materials and the changes in the crystal structure after the experiments. X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analyses of mechanically activated alkaline residues show respectively that with increasing the grinding time the crystallinity of the materials decreases and the carbonate content, the CO 2 uptake and the calcium conversion efficiency generally increase...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{kneading}} and forming process or pasta quality have been investigated. Using the same blend of wheat flour and keeping mixing and drying conditions constant, three types of spaghetti were produced using the following three kneading and forming processes: A) kneading with a <b>continuous</b> <b>press</b> <b>and</b> forming by pressure-extrusion; B) kneading and forming by sheeting-rolls; C) kneading by hand and forming with sheeting-rolls. These three processes impart different mechanical work on the dough. The three types of dried spaghetti exhibited differences in cooking requirements and in cooing quality. Spaghetti (A) absorbed water more slowly and showed poor cooking quality. Spaghetti (B) and (C) had a shorter cooking time, no stickiness and good firmness after cooking. Spaghetti compactness seems to control water absorption during cooking, i. e., the greater the compactness, the longer the cooking time. Nevertheless, compactness does not explain differences in cooking quality. On the contrary, this characteristic is clearly related to the different organization of proteins, as transmission and scanning electron microscopy images revealed. In fact both spaghetti (B) and (C) showed a compact <b>and</b> <b>continuous</b> protein network, probably {{as a consequence of}} the mild and ordered kneading obtained by the sheeting process. Spaghetti (A), produced by dough kneading implying strong mechanical stresses, exhibited protein network breakage which may account for its poor cooking quality. The results of the present work indicate that industrial kneading and extrusion, as performed today in the <b>continuous</b> <b>press,</b> are unsuitable for making the best use of poor quality raw materials. The pressure-extrusion process requires technological innovations which could ensure spaghetti with cooking quality comparable to that produced in the traditional sheeting process as well as high productivity...|$|R

40|$|Offshore {{structures}} {{are placed in}} regions where they can these structures can exhibit unfavourable dynamical behaviour when these ice floes fail in a crushing manner against the structures. Three modes of interaction have been observed: (1) intermittent crushing, (2) frequency locking, (3) continuous crushing. This master thesis has been conducted to develop a model which predicts these interaction modes, in terms of deflection of the structure and the ice forces that act on the structure. Ice structure interaction is a non-linear phenomenon. Non-linear systems can have coexisting solutions. These solutions are sought for. Their dependency on input parameters is made visible through a bifurcation diagram. The developed models are based on earlier work with friction based self-sustained oscillations, with additional modifications to describe the inhomogeneity of the ice, the unidirectionality of the ice force and the possible arise of {{a gap between the}} ice and the structure. Such a gap occurs when the structure moves faster than the ice rim. Results calculated with the models that have been developed are then compared with data from laboratory experiments. The sticktion friction model with the above described modifications shows good results for the intermittent <b>crushing</b> regime <b>and</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>crushing</b> regime. However, it fails to describe the response of the structure satisfactorily in the frequency locking regime. These differences between calculated results and experimental results are caused {{by the fact that the}} ice force cannot be characterized properly by only two parameters as is the case in the sticktion friction model. Using ice characteristics as a function of both the relative velocity between the structure and the ice, as well as the absolute acceleration of the structure, resolves this short-coming. It is expected that the velocity dependent and acceleration dependent ice forces are ice type specific. Therefor further tests are recommended in order to determine these dependencies.

To reuse these soils in the construction sites, the soil improvements by mixing with cement or lime were sometime adopted. Recently, the {{case in which the}} improved soil was excavated, refilled and compacted was supposed. As the improved soil was excavated, refilled and compacted, it was necessary to evaluate the strength of the improved soil. However, the strength of stabilized soil was decreased by repetition of excavation, refill and compaction processes.
