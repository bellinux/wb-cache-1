5|$|During the Second World War Trafford Park {{was largely}} {{turned over to}} the {{production}} of matériel, including the Avro Manchester heavy bomber, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of 1940. On the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124incendiaries and 120high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were Manchester United's Old Trafford football ground, All Saints' Church, St Hilda's Church, and the children's library in King Street. Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to hide it from enemy aircraft, and 11,900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, along with their teachers and supervisors. A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948, over the <b>communal</b> <b>grave</b> of the 17unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940.|$|E

40|$|In 2007, {{excavations}} in {{a suburb}} of the Catalan town of Tàrrega identified the possible location of the medieval Jewish cemetery. Subsequent excavations confirmed that multiple individuals buried in six <b>communal</b> <b>graves</b> had suffered violent deaths. The present study argues that these <b>communal</b> <b>graves</b> can be connected to a well-documented assault on the Jews of Tàrrega that occurred in 1348 : long {{known as one of the}} earliest episodes of anti-Jewish violence related to the Black Death, but never before corroborated by physical remains.

500|$|The {{church was}} {{damaged beyond repair}} in a German bombing raid in December 1940. In August 1944, the human remains housed in the catacombs were {{transferred}} to Hollybrook Cemetery in Southampton where they were reburied in a single <b>communal</b> <b>grave.</b> In all, the remains of 403 people were transferred, some fairly well preserved in their oak coffins with leaden shells, but others had disintegrated completely. The ruins of the church building were subsequently demolished [...] – sources do not indicate exactly when – and replaced by shops and a multi-storey car park. The parish registers were successfully retrieved from the ruin and, despite being charred and damaged by candle wax and molten tar (the results of a fire that followed the bombing), they have been restored.|$|E

500|$|French {{ambassador}} Stanislas Ostroróg {{was involved}} in returning {{the remains of the}} Irish poet from France to Ireland in 1948; {{in a letter to the}} European director of the Foreign Ministry in Paris [...] "Ostrorog tells how Yeats’s son Michael sought official help in locating the poet’s remains. [...] Neither Michael Yeats nor Sean MacBride, the Irish foreign minister who organised the ceremony, wanted to know the details of how the remains were collected, Ostrorog notes. [...] He repeatedly urges caution and discretion and says the Irish ambassador in Paris should not be informed." [...] Yeats' body was exhumed in 1946 and the remains were moved to on ossuary and mixed with other remains. The French Foreign Ministry authorized Ostrorog to secretly cover the cost of repatriation from his slush fund. Authorities were worried about the fact that the much-loved poet's remains were thrown into a <b>communal</b> <b>grave,</b> causing embarrassment for both Ireland and France. [...] "Mr Rebouillat, (a) forensic doctor in Roquebrune would be able to reconstitute a skeleton presenting all the characteristics of the deceased."

500|$|The {{day after}} the battle, Harold's body was identified, either by his armour or marks on his body. [...] His {{personal}} standard was presented to William, and later sent to the papacy. The bodies of the English dead, including some of Harold's brothers and housecarls, were left on the battlefield, although some were removed by relatives later. The Norman dead were buried in a large <b>communal</b> <b>grave,</b> {{which has not been}} found. Exact casualty figures are unknown. Of the Englishmen known to be at the battle, the number of dead implies that the death rate was about 50 per cent of those engaged, although this may be too high. Of the named Normans who fought at Hastings, one in seven is stated to have died, but these were all noblemen, and it is probable that the death rate among the common soldiers was higher. Although Orderic Vitalis's figures are highly exaggerated, his ratio of one in four casualties may be accurate. Marren speculates that perhaps 2,000 Normans and 4,000 Englishmen were killed at Hastings. Reports stated that some of the English dead were still being found on the hillside years later. Although scholars thought {{for a long time that}} remains would not be recoverable, due to the acidic soil, recent finds have changed this view. One skeleton that was found in a medieval cemetery, and originally was thought to be associated with the 13th century Battle of Lewes now is thought to be associated with Hastings instead.|$|E
2500|$|The {{expression}} [...] "common grave" [...] {{refers to}} neither a <b>communal</b> <b>grave</b> nor a pauper's grave, but {{to an individual}} grave for {{a member of the}} common people (i.e., not the aristocracy).

25|$|At around 15:00 on that Monday, two {{military}} commissioners and a {{squad of}} PAC patrolmen arrived in Plan de Sánchez and ordered the survivors to dig graves and bury the victims' remains, threatening them that the village would be bombarded {{by the air force}} if they failed to comply. More than 20 clandestine <b>communal</b> <b>graves</b> were dug and filled.

There was nothing to suggest a break in occupation between level I and II of the site. Burial customs appear to have been unchanged between the two periods. Burials were mostly done in <b>communal</b> <b>graves,</b> with little deposits of grave goods. Different flint tools were found at the site in both periods, including sickles and arrowheads.|$|R
50|$|The {{remains of}} the victims, mostly little more than ashes and charred bones (much of the flesh having been {{stripped}} from the bones by the hoses used by Uruguayan tugs {{to put out the}} fire), were buried in six urns in two <b>communal</b> <b>graves</b> in The British Cemetery Montevideo on 20 May 1972 by the Right Reverend Jonas Ewing White in the presence of 130 relatives who had been flown out to Uruguay by the ship's owners. A memorial service was held at All Hallows-by-the-Tower in London on 8 June.|$|R

2500|$|The {{community}} acquired about [...] of land at Black Rock—a clifftop area east of Brighton, then in {{the parish}} of Rottingdean—in 1855 and established a new graveyard there. [...] The first burial took place in July of that year. [...] The site was a narrow strip of land alongside Rifle Butt Road. [...] Burials continued until September 1971, by which time 311 men, {{women and children were}} interred; but in 1972, Brighton Corporation (forerunners of the present Brighton and Hove City Council) placed a compulsory purchase order on the land. [...] The Brighton Marina development below the cliffs at Black Rock had been approved, and the site was needed for construction of a link road. [...] The remains of every body were exhumed, names were recorded and stored at Brighton History Centre, and some headstones were retained. [...] The Corporation dug a <b>communal</b> <b>grave</b> at the Lawn Memorial Park cemetery at Woodingdean, reinterred the remains there and laid out the surviving headstones. [...] New Quaker burials take place in this section of the cemetery.|$|E

40|$|Many archaeologists {{investigated}} the burial {{practices of the}} Jomon in order to clarify emerging social complexity, especially in the 1950 s. Recently, since the social complexity of the Jomon became an important issue, burial practice has been recognised {{as an indicator of}} a hereditary ranking system. As I have noted elsewhere, there is no clear evidence that a hereditary ranking system existed in Jomon society. However, instead of searching for hereditary ranking in the Jomon, burial practices could be analysed from another aspect. The temporal and regional distribution of Jomon burial practices has been clarified. In the Kanto district, <b>communal</b> <b>graves</b> appeared in the early Late Jomon. This type of burial has been discovered only in this area. In the same period, some burial practices also appeared in other areas of Eastern Japan. Although this change from Middle to Late Jomon has been recognised, it has not been investigated from the perspective of social complexity. In this paper, I will try to examine the change in burial practices from the Middle to the Late Jomon in terms of social complexity...|$|R

So just in case this needs clarification, I said nothing of the sort." [...] Boucher-Hayes also spoke of embarrassment felt by locals at the revelations: [...] "Talk to anybody else and there's a bit of hand wringing, there's a bit of chest beating {{and a lot of}} 'ah sure, those were the times, weren't they, what's the point in going and unearthing it now'. And I think that that is an embarrassment about our past that is probably replicated in so many places where there were industrial schools, where there were mother and baby homes and where there is now the suspicion in Cork, in Westmeath, in Tipperary that there are very, very large <b>communal</b> <b>graves</b> of unmarked bodies, unknown about, un-commemorated, discarded bodies." ...|$|R
