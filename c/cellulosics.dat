We examine the future market for <b>cellulosic</b> biofuels, differentiating between <b>cellulosic</b> ethanol and 'drop-in' <b>cellulosic</b> biofuels that can be transported with petroleum fuels and have equivalent energy values. We show that emergence of a <b>cellulosic</b> ethanol industry is unlikely without costly government subsidies, in part because of strong competition from conventional ethanol and limits on ethanol blending. If production costs of drop-in <b>cellulosic</b> biofuels fall enough to become competitive, then their expansion will not necessarily cause feedstock prices to rise. As long as local supplies of feedstocks that have no or low-valued alternative uses exist, then expansion will not cause prices to rise significantly. If <b>cellulosic</b> feedstocks come from dedicated biomass crops, then the supply curves will have a steeper slope because of competition for land. <b>Cellulosic</b> biofuels Market conditions Investments...|$|R

50|$|The {{gunpowder}} {{manufacturing company}} Wolff & Co.

At first only one steam locomotive was employed, but after a short time the line was electrified to a 600 volt, direct current system. For that, three electric locomotives were used; {{they were joined by}} a fourth in 1943. From the 1930s diesel locomotives were also used to handle the growing levels of industrial traffic and, in 1940, a second-hand benzene-powered railbus was bought for passenger services between Bomlitz and Walsrode.In 1938 a junction between the industrial line and the Walsrode-Soltau railway was established at Honerdingen station. In 1944 the industrial lines had reached a total length of 31.6 km but, after 1945, {{a large part of the}} network was dismantled.
