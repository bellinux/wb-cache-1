40|$|Lecturepg. 22 The {{combination}} of a 16 inch Pitot tube pump with a switched reluctance motor represents a significant development {{in the field of}} high-pressure pumping. A field proven Pitot tube pump design has been mechanically integrated with a high performance switched reluctance motor. The resulting system is approximately 40 percent {{of the size of the}} standard unit it replaces. The <b>close-coupled</b> <b>pump</b> eliminates the need for a gearbox, two couplings, and field alignment. The unit is able to utilize software within the controller to monitor loading on the pump. The first unit to be installed has been in continuous service at a Yorkshire, United kingdom, power station for over one year...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{research}} is to compare the efficiency level of centrifugal pumps of various designs to be used at the second stage pumping stations of public water supply systems and at the main pumping stations of district heating systems. For this purpose, a variety of centrifugal pumps have been analysed and the regression equations with the coefficients of determination have been derived. The main conclusion is as follows: horizontal end-suction single-stage <b>close-coupled</b> <b>pumps</b> are less efficient in comparison with vertical in-line multistage <b>close-coupled</b> <b>pumps,</b> when the flow rate is up to 83 m 3 /h at the definite range of the head (from 30 to 55 m) ...|$|R
50|$|To have a {{well-developed}} flow pattern, pump manufacturer's manuals recommend about (10 diameters?) {{of straight}} pipe run upstream of the pump inlet flange. Unfortunately, piping designers and plant personnel {{must contend with}} space and equipment layout constraints and usually cannot comply with this recommendation. Instead, {{it is common to}} use an elbow <b>close-coupled</b> to the <b>pump</b> suction which creates a poorly developed flow pattern at the pump suction.|$|R
50|$|A {{submersible}} pump (or sub pump, electric {{submersible pump}} (ESP)) is a device {{which has a}} hermetically sealed motor <b>close-coupled</b> to the <b>pump</b> body. The whole assembly is submerged in the fluid to be pumped. The main advantage {{of this type of}} pump is that it prevents pump cavitation, a problem associated with a high elevation difference between pump and the fluid surface. Submersible pumps push fluid to the surface as opposed to jet pumps having to pull fluids. Submersibles are more efficient than jet pumps.|$|R

Three performance experiments with the same centrifugal pump, using an open test rig, are carried out and compared, first using the original impeller provided by the manufacturer of the pump, second using an FDM replication of the original one without post-treatment, and third using a chemically dimethyl ketone post-treated FDM replication. The results obtained in the tests demonstrate the functional behavior of both additive FDM impellers in comparison with the one fabricated by means of conventional technology (subtractive manufacturing). Additionally, analogous head-flow curves (and also with an improved performance to the one of the original impeller) are obtained. This research paper introduces significant information concerning a low-cost and low-time manufacturing process of additive functional parts. Moreover, new results are presented regarding the performance of chemically post-treated FDM parts working in functional applications. FDM impellers of high complexity and quality, which meet performance criteria, can be achieved.
