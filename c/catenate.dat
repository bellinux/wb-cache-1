More generally they show a marked tendency to exist in allotropic forms, and a stronger inclination to catenate; and have a weaker ability to form hydrogen bonds. The ability of carbon to <b>catenate,</b> in particular, is fundamental {{to the field of}} organic chemistry and life on Earth.

40|$|The normal {{sequence}} {{at which}} SV 40 DNA replication terminates (TER) {{is unusual in}} that it promotes formation of <b>catenated</b> intertwines when two converging replication forks enter to complete replication (Weaver et al., 1985). Here we show that yeast centromeric sequences also exhibit this phenomenon. CEN 3 caused accumulation of late replicating intermediates and <b>catenated</b> dimers in plasmids replicating in mammalian cells, but only when it was located in the termination region (180 degrees from ori), and only when cells were subjected to hypertonic shock to reduce topoisomerase II activity. Therefore, formation of <b>catenated</b> intertwines during termination of DNA replication was sequence dependent, suggesting that topoisomerase II acts behind replication forks in the termination region to remove intertwines generated by unwinding DNA rather than acting after replication is completed and <b>catenates</b> are formed. Under normal physiological conditions, CEN 3 did not promote formation of <b>catenated</b> dimers in either mammalian or yeast cells. Therefore, CEN does not maintain association of sister chromatids during mitosis in yeast by introducing stable <b>catenated</b> intertwines during replication...|$|R

Unlike the topoisomerase inhibitors VP- 16 and camptothecin, ICRF- 193 {{had little effect on}} DNA chain elongation during SV 40 DNA replication, but high-molecular-weight DNAs instead of segregated monomer DNAs accumulated as major products. Analysis of the high-molecular-weight DNAs by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that they consisted of <b>catenated</b> dimers and late Cairns-type DNAs. Incubation of the replicated DNA with topoisomerase II resulted in conversion of the <b>catenated</b> dimers to monomer DNAs. These results indicate that ICRF- 193 induces accumulation of <b>catenated</b> dimers and late Cairns-type DNAs by blocking the decatenating and relaxing activities of topoisomerase II in the late stage of SV 40 DNA replication. In contrast, DNA replication of SV 40 chromosomes was severely blocked by ICRF- 193 at the late stage, and no <b>catenated</b> dimers were synthesized. These results are consistent with the finding that topoisomerase II is required for unwinding of the final duplex DNA in the late stage of SV 40 chromosome replication in vitro...|$|R

We show that if the deletion is always done at the beginning and the catenation at the end, and the choice of a word to be <b>catenated</b> does not depend on the word erased, then the generated language is always regular, though the derivability relation is not, in general, rational. If the deletion and the catenation are done arbitrarily at the opposite ends, the language need not be regular.

Catenation ability is also influenced by a range of steric and electronic factors, including the electronegativity of the element in question, the molecular orbital hybridization {{and the ability to}} form different kinds of covalent bonds. For carbon, the sigma overlap between adjacent atoms is sufficiently strong that perfectly stable chains can be formed. With other elements this was once thought to be extremely difficult in spite of plenty of evidence to the contrary.|$|E

40|$|Summary. -MtDNA was {{extracted}} by a phenol method from transplanted {{and primary}} DAB induced hepatomata in male Wistar rats, normal rat liver, spontaneous human tumours (2 Wilm's tumours, one neuroblastoma and one adrenal carcinoma), {{as well as}} 2 specimens of normal human kidney, BNU induced " leukaemias " in mice and CHO fibroblasts in monolayer culture. The proportion of monomers, <b>catenated</b> dimers and oligomers, open dimers and small circles was determined by electron microscopy of the fractions comprising lower and middle DNA bands in a CsCl-EthBr gradient. Tumours were compared where possible with their normal tissue of origin. Open dimers were found in 2 Wilm's tumours and their attached " normal-looking " kidney tissue but not in normal, non-malignant kidney or any other tissue studied. In Wilm's tumours, the occurrence of open dimers {{is far from being}} an all-or-none phenomenon. Malignancy produced little change in the relative proportions of <b>catenated</b> dimers and oligomers in the tissues studied. Small circles were found associated with mtDNA from every tissue. Tumour mtDNA was not more heterogeneous in length than monomers from the corresponding normal tissue, neither was the mean length of tumour mtDNA significantly different from its corresponding normal mtDNA. MtDNA exists, with little variation, as circular molecules approximately 5,tm in circumference, in animals throughout the evolutionary scale from nematodes to man. Departures from the usual 5,tm monomer size occur as interlocked molecules (<b>catenated</b> dimers and oligomers), double length molecules (open dimers) and very small molecules, less than 5,um in circumference, which may not be mitochondrial in origin (Smith and Vinograd, 1972). <b>Catenated</b> dimers have been reported in many tissues (Dawid, 1966...|$|R

Unsaturated silanes, the silenes and silynes, have been characterized spectroscopically.

Stannane, a strong reducing agent slowly decomposes at room temperature to tin and hydrogen gas, and is decomposed by concentrated aqueous acids or alkalis; distannane, Sn2H6 is still more unstable, and longer stannanes are unknown. Plumbane is very poorly characterised and is only known in trace amounts: even at low temperatures, synthesis methods that yield the other MH4 compounds fail to give PbH4.

In bacteria, these <b>catenated</b> molecules become supercoiled by DNA gyrase {{before they}} undergo a complete decatenation by topoisomerase IV (Topo IV). Topo IV is {{also involved in}} the unknotting of supercoiled DNA molecules. Using Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the shapes of supercoiled DNA molecules that are either knotted or <b>catenated.</b> We are especially interested in understanding how Topo IV can unknot right-handed knots and decatenate right-handed catenanes without acting on right-handed plectonemes in negatively supercoiled DNA molecules. To this end, we investigate how the topological consequences of intersegmental passages depend on the geometry of the DNA-DNA juxtapositions at which these passages occur. We observe that there are interesting differences between the geometries of DNA-DNA juxtapositions in the interwound portions and in the knotted or <b>catenated</b> portions of the studied molecules. In particular, in negatively supercoiled, multiply interlinked, right-handed catenanes, we detect specific regions where DNA segments belonging to two freshly replicated sister DNA molecules form left-handed crossings. We propose that, due to its geometrical preference to act on left-handed crossings, Topo IV can specifically unknot supercoiled DNA, as well as decatenate postreplicative catenanes, without causing their torsional relaxation...|$|R
