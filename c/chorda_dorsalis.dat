At a still earlier period the progenitors of man must have been aquatic in their habits; for morphology plainly tells us that our lungs consist of a modified swim-bladder, which once served as a float. The clefts on the neck in the embryo of man show where the branchiæ once existed. At about this period the true kidneys were replaced by the corpora Wolffiana. The heart existed as a simple pulsating vessel; and the <b>chorda</b> <b>dorsalis</b> took {{the place of a}} vertebral column.

60|$|Now {{it seems}} to us that the various kinds of {{integration}} here exemplified, which are commonly set down as so many independent phenomena, ought to be generalized, and included in the formula describing the process of development. The fact that in an adult crab, many pairs of ganglia originally separate have become fused into a single mass, is a fact only second in significance to the differentiation of its alimentary canal into stomach and intestine. That in the higher Annulosa, a single heart replaces the string of rudimentary hearts constituting the dorsal blood-vessel in the lower Annulosa, (reaching in one species to the number of one hundred and sixty), is a truth as much needing to be comprised in the history of evolution, as is the formation of a respiratory surface by a branched expansion of the skin. A right conception of the genesis of a vertebral column, includes not only the differentiations from which result the <b>chorda</b> <b>dorsalis</b> and the vertebral segments imbedded in it; but quite as much it includes the coalescence of numerous vertebral processes with their respective vertebral bodies. The changes in virtue of which several things become one, demand recognition equally with those in virtue of which one thing becomes several. Evidently, then, the current statement which ascribes the developmental progress to differentiations alone, is incomplete. Adequately to express the facts, we must say that the transition from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous is carried on by differentiations and accompanying integrations.|$|E
60|$|The early {{progenitors}} of {{man must}} have been once covered with hair, both sexes having beards; their ears were probably pointed, and capable of movement; and their bodies were provided with a tail, having the proper muscles. Their limbs and bodies were also acted on by many muscles which now only occasionally reappear, but are normally present in the Quadrumana. At this or some earlier period, the great artery and nerve of the humerus ran through a supra-condyloid foramen. The intestine gave forth a much larger diverticulum or caecum than that now existing. The foot was then prehensile, judging from {{the condition of the}} great toe in the foetus; and our progenitors, no doubt, were arboreal in their habits, and frequented some warm, forest-clad land. The males had great canine teeth, which served them as formidable weapons. At a much earlier period the uterus was double; the excreta were voided through a cloaca; and the eye was protected by a third eyelid or nictitating membrane. At a still earlier period the progenitors of man {{must have been}} aquatic in their habits; for morphology plainly tells us that our lungs consist of a modified swim-bladder, which once served as a float. The clefts on the neck in the embryo of man shew where the branchiae once existed. In the lunar or weekly recurrent periods of some of our functions we apparently still retain traces of our primordial birthplace, a shore washed by the tides. At about this same early period the true kidneys were replaced by the corpora wolffiana. The heart existed as a simple pulsating vessel; and the <b>chorda</b> <b>dorsalis</b> took the place of a vertebral column. These early ancestors of man, thus seen in the dim recesses of time, must have been as simply, or even still more simply organised than the lancelet or amphioxus.|$|E
60|$|Lastly, {{one single}} {{member of the}} immense and diversified class of fishes, namely the lancelet or amphioxus, is so {{different}} from all other fishes, that Häckel maintains that it ought to form a distinct class in the vertebrate kingdom. This fish is remarkable for its negative characters; it can hardly be said to possess a brain, vertebral column, or heart, &c.; {{so that it was}} classed by the older naturalists amongst the worms. Many years ago Prof. Goodsir perceived that the lancelet presented some affinities with the Ascidians, which are invertebrate, hermaphrodite, marine creatures permanently attached to a support. They hardly appear like animals, and consist of a simple, tough, leathery sack, with two small projecting orifices. They belong to the Molluscoida of Huxley—a lower division of the great kingdom of the Mollusca; but they have recently been placed by some naturalists amongst the Vermes or worms. Their larvæ somewhat resemble tadpoles in shape,[275] and have the power of swimming freely about. Some observations lately made by M. Kowalevsky,[276] since confirmed by Prof. Kuppfer, will form a discovery of extraordinary interest, if still further extended, as I hear from M. Kowalevsky in Naples he has now effected. The discovery is that the larvæ of Ascidians are related to the Vertebrata, in their manner of development, in the relative position of the nervous system, and in possessing a structure closely like the <b>chorda</b> <b>dorsalis</b> of vertebrate animals. It thus appears, if we may rely on embryology, which has always proved the safest guide in classification, that we have at last gained a clue to the source whence the Vertebrata have been derived. We should thus be justified in believing that at an extremely remote period a group of animals existed, resembling in many respects the larvæ of our present Ascidians, which diverged into two great branches—the one retrograding in development and producing the present class of Ascidians, the other rising to the crown and summit of the animal kingdom by giving birth to the Vertebrata.|$|E

40|$|Chordoma is {{the fourth}} most common {{malignant}} primary neoplasm of the skeleton and almost the only one showing a real epithelial phenotype. Besides classic chordoma, so-called chondroid chordoma {{was described as a}} specific entity showing cartilage-like tissue within chordomatoid structures. However, since its first description, strongly conflicting results have been reported about the existence of chondroid chordoma and several studies suggested chondroid chordomas being in fact low-grade conventional chondrosarcomas. In the present study, we used cytoprotein expression profiling and molecular in situ localization techniques of marker gene products indicative of developmental phenotypes of chondrocytes to elucidate origin and biology of chondroid chordoma. We were able to demonstrate the chondrogenic potential of chordomas irrespectively of the appearance of overt cartilage formation by identifying the multifocal expression of type II collagen, the main marker of chondrocytic differentiation. Additionally, the cartilage-typical large aggregating proteoglycan aggrecan was present throughout all chordomas and, thus, a very characteristic gene product and marker of these neoplasms. Biochemical matrix composition and cell differentiation pattern analysis showed a high resemblance of classic chordomas and in chordoid areas of chondroid chordomas to the fetal <b>chorda</b> <b>dorsalis,</b> whereas chondroid areas of chondroid chordomas showed features similar to adult nucleus pulposus. This demonstrates on the cell function level the chondrocytic differentiation potential of neoplastic chordoid cells as a characteristic facet of chordomas, mimicking fetal vertebral development, ie, the transition of the <b>chorda</b> <b>dorsalis</b> to the nucleus pulposus. Our study firmly establishes a focal real chondrocytic phenotype of neoplastic cells in chordomas. Chondroid chordoma is neither a low-grade chondrosarcoma nor a misnomer as discussed previously...|$|E
40|$|Die im Meso- und Bathypelagial aller Weltmeere vorkommenden Tiefseefische der Familie Stomiidae (Schuppendrachenfische) zählen 281 Arten in 28 Gattungen. Allen Vertretern der Stomiidae fehlt eine knöcherne Gelenkung zwischen dem Occiput und dem ersten Wirbel. In der dadurch entstehenden occipito-vertebralen Lücke wird die Chordascheide exponiert. In früheren Studien wurde diese occipito-vertebrale Lücke als Verlust eines oder mehrerer Wirbel oder Wirbelzentren gedeutet. Funktionell ist die Lückenbildung wahrscheinlich als Verbesserung der Kopfbeweglichkeit zu interpretieren. Die vorliegende Arbeit umfasst die Reevaluation der hierzu existierenden Literatur und die praktische Überprüfung der Hypothese der Wirbelreduktion bei den Stomiidae. Dazu wurden 26 der heute gültigen 28 Gattungen vergleichend morphologisch untersucht. Viele der verwendeten Taxa sind erstmals zur Klärung der Fragestellung herangezogen worden. Anhand histologischer Schnittserien sowie spezieller Aufhell- und Färbetechniken wurden die Ansatzstellen occipitaler und vertebraler Myosepten am Occiput und Axialskelett genauer bestimmt. Durch die Identifizierung und Zählung der spino-occipitalen Nerven konnten die gewonnenen Erkenntnisse erhärtet werden. Bei allen bekannten Teleostei stehen die ersten drei Myosepten mit dem Occiput in Verbindung (occipitale Myosepten). Das vierte Myoseptum ist immer mit dem ersten Wirbel assoziiert. Kann keine Verbindung zwischen viertem Myoseptum und einem Wirbel festgestellt werden, ist dies ein Indiz für dessen teilweise oder vollständige Reduktion und das Myoseptum setzt direkt an der Chordascheide an. Mittels dieses methodischen Zugangs lässt sich der neue Befund erheben, dass es nur bei den Taxa Chauliodus, Eustomias und Leptostomias gladiator zu einer vollständigen Reduktion von Wirbelzentren kommt. In welchem Fall die entsprechenden Neuralbögen und Parapophysen persistieren. Es kommt jedoch zu beachtlichen inter- und intragenerischen Unterschieden in der Anzahl der reduzierten Wirbelzentren. Bei allen anderen Stomiidae (Neonesthes, Astronesthes, Borostomias, Rhadinesthes, Heterophotus, Stomias, Trigonolampa, Chirostomias, Flagellostomias, Opostomias, Odontostomias, Thysanactis, Photonectes, Melanostomias, Echiostoma, Tactostoma, Idiacanthus, Grammatostomias, Bathophilus, Pachystomias, Photostomias, Malacosteus und Aristostomias) ist die mehr oder weniger exponierte Chordascheide zwischen Occiput und erstem Wirbel lediglich durch die Streckung des Axialskeletts bedingt. Bei diesen Gattungen kommt es somit zu keiner Wirbelreduktion. Der komplexe Aufbau und die larvale Ontogenese des vorderen Axialskeletts der Stomiidae werden vergleichend und phylogenetisch-systematisch diskutiert. Desweiteren konnte bei Bathophilus, Eustomias, Pachystomias, Malacosteus, Photostomias und Aristostomias eine ventrale Reservefalte der <b>Chorda</b> <b>dorsalis</b> festgestellt werden, in welche die caudalwärts verlängerte Occipitalregion hineinragt. Dieses sogenannte „sekundäre Kopfgelenk“ ermöglicht eine Verlängerung der gefalteten ventralen Chordascheide und ein weiteres Anheben des Kopfes. Das Merkmal des „sekundären Kopfgelenks“ wird in vorliegender Arbeit als Synapomorphie der {{genannten}} Gattungen (Bathophilus, Eustomias, Pachystomias, Malacosteus, Photostomias und Aristostomias) betrachtet. Damit wird die Monophylie der von Nelson (2006) etablierten Unterfamilie der „Malacosteinae“ (Malacosteus, Photostomias und Aristostomias) in Frage gestellt. The family Stomiidae (barbeled dragonfishes) comprises 281 {{species in}} 28 genera {{and consists of}} meso- and bathypelagic fishes that {{are found in the}} open water of all major temperate and subtropical oceans. In all stomiid genera there is an occipito-vertebral gap between the skull and the first vertebra bridged only by the flexible notochord. Morphological studies from the early 20 th century suggested that some stomiid genera have one to ten of the anteriormost centra reduced or entire vertebrae missing in this region. Our study reviews this previous hypothesis, and with a new approach we show that only in Chauliodus, Eustomias and Leptostomias gladiator vertebral centra are actually lost, with their respective neural arches and parapophyses persisting. We present results from a comparative analysis of the number and insertion sites of the anteriormost myosepta in 26 of the 28 stomiid genera. Generally in teleosts the first three myosepta are associated with the occiput, and the fourth is the first vertebral myoseptum. The insertion site of the fourth myoseptum {{plays an important role in}} this analysis, because it provides a landmark for the first vertebra. Lack of association of the fourth myoseptum with a vertebra is thus evidence that the first vertebra is reduced or absent. By counting the occipital and vertebral myosepta the number of reduced vertebrae in Chauliodus, Eustomias and Leptostomias gladiator can be inferred. Proper identification of the spino-occipital nerves provides an additional source of information about vertebral reduction. In all other stomiid genera the extensive occipito-vertebral gap is not a consequence of the reduction of vertebrae, but of an elongation of the notochord. The complex structure and ontogeny of the anterior part of the vertebral column of stomiids are discussed comparatively. Further a novel morphological feature is present within the six stomiid genera Eustomias, Bathophilus, Pachystomias, Malacosteus, Photostomias, and Aristostomias. This feature includes parts of the occipital region of the skull and the notochord where the chordal sheath is folded ventrally and this extra sheath can be extended when the head is pulled upwards. The flexibility of the head reaching out for prey is improved by this mechanism. Such a mechanism that allows the bending of the region between head and trunk is unique among teleosts. In addition it also seems to be an important new morphological character elucidating novel hypothesis regarding stomiid intrarelationships since the six genera that posses this novelty belong to different stomiid subfamilies (Melanostomiinae and Malacosteinae, according to Nelson 2006) ...|$|E
40|$|The four {{available}} "short-spine dogs" {{were investigated}} pathologically; {{the results obtained}} may be summarized as follows. 1. The cartilaginous tissues in the vertebral column, in point of composition of the column, were quantitatively more abundant than those of normal dogs. In addition, the epiphyseal cartilaginous plates remained {{for a long period}} of time and especially cartilaginous fragments in the arcus vertebrae were recognized in all cases. These phenomena are suggesive of the probability that ossification of the vertebrae is feeble during the developmental process and also after birth. 2. The tissue debris of the <b>chorda</b> <b>dorsalis</b> in the spaces of the nuclei pulposi (n. p.) began to disappear during considerably early stages after birth, and the spaces of the n. p. were gradually invaded by low-differentiated cartilage cells of the perinuclear layer of the annulus fibrosus (a. f.) and were-entirely in some instances-occupied by the cartilaginous structures. On that occasion, even in the 5 -year-old dog, there sometimes existed such n. p. as the replacing by cartilaginous tissues had not been perfectly occurred. 3. In the a. f., according to the progressive changes of the low-differentiated cartilage cells, the formation of many groups constituted of these cells was recognized. These cell groups were found chiefly in the interior but also in the peripheral portion of the a. f.; moreover, massive hyaline cartilaginous tissues were scatteringly found in the a. f. That is to say, in the a. f. pretty extensively low-differentiated and progressive changes were seen simultaneously. In addition to these changes, degeneration of cartilaginous tissues was recognized in various portions of the a. f. and especially, usually found in scattered portions of the cartilage cell groups. It may be understood that these pictures are highly significant in respect to the deformation of the vertebral coltumn in the developmental process and moreover, after birth. 4. In the parts of the a. f. constituted of fibrocartilaginous tissue, fish-bone patterned structures were irregular in some places due to the morphological abnormalities of the corpus vertebrae and degenerative changes of the cartilaginous tissue. 5. In the a. f. adjacent to the corpus vertebrae and in the cartilaginous plates adjacent to the corpus vertebrae which were seen on the central surfaces of the epiphysis of the corpus vertebrae and in the parts facing the central portions of bifidities of the corpus vertebrae, the loss of the calcified zones of cartilage was seen in some places, as a result of the degenerative changes of cartilaginous tissue principally, though occasionally, in having no relation to such changes. In the majority of the epiphyseal cartilaginous plates, foci of degeneration were recognized. It may be considered that these changes exert considerable interference in the growth of the corpus vertebrae. 6. In the a. f., free new-formed bone tissues and periostally new-formed bone tissues deposited in the corpus vertebrae were observed here and there. 7. In one place respectively in cases Nos. 1 and 4,fusion of a part of the corpus vertebrae and of the entire vertebrae was recognized. As to the embryological mechanism of these changes further investigation needs to be performed. 8. The areas of clefts of the arcus vertebrae and proc. spinosus were occupied by cartilaginous or fibrous or both; in these cartilaginous tissues, pictures of degeneration were found. Furthermore, as shown in the vertebrae cervicales in case No. 3,there were bifidities of the arcus vertebrae which had been repaired with new-formed bone tissues. 9. In the articulationes intervertebralis, costovertebralis and sacro-iliaca, both degeneration of the articular cartilages and unification of the articular surfaces were observed in many of the joints. A picture of ossification was observable in the peripheral part of the unified articulatio intervertebralis between the os sacrum and the vertebrae coccygeae in case No. 1. It may be understood that in the joints of the vertebral column, degeneration of the articular cartilages and unification of the articular surfaces arise from mechanical factors and, sometimes, that osseous fusion occurs in these joints. 10. The relation between the changes of the ganglia spinalia and nerve bundles of the nervi spinales in the vertebral canal and the deformity of the vertebral column must be a subject for further research. 11. In the costo-chondral junctions foci of degeneration were found in all cases. In case No. 4,the dorsal ends of some costae were articulated with each other. Moreover, in these joints, there were degeneration of articular cartilages, unification of articular surfaces, formation of free new-formed bone tissue and periostal apposition of new bone tissue. It may be considered that the morphological abnormalities of the costae have occurred as secondary results of deformities of the vertebral column. 12. In the bones other than the vertebral column, costae, sternum and os coxae, and in the visceral organs, there was no finding directly related with deformation of the vertebral column. Thus, on the basis of the present pathological findings concerning the "short-spine dogs", the following conclusions may be drawn. It may be regarded that in the vertebral column, low differentiation, progressive changes and degeneration of cartilaginous tissue in the a. f. as well as low accomplishment of ossification occurred in the developmental process and after birth. It may be understood that these processes are principal causes of deformation of the vertebral column and that the morphological abnormalities of the arcus vertebrae and other portions can be induced secondarily...|$|E
