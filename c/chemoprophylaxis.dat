25|$|A {{review of}} {{fourteen}} studies in sub-Saharan Africa, covering insecticide-treated nets, residual spraying, <b>chemoprophylaxis</b> for children, <b>chemoprophylaxis</b> or intermittent treatment for pregnant women, a hypothetical vaccine and changing frontâ€“line drug treatment, found decision making {{limited by the}} lack of information on the costs and effects of many interventions, the small number of cost-effectiveness analyses, the lack of evidence on the costs and effects of packages of measures and the problems in generalizing or comparing studies that relate to specific settings and use different methodologies and outcome measures. The two cost-effectiveness estimates of DDT residual spraying examined were not found to provide an accurate estimate of the cost-effectiveness of DDT spraying; the resulting estimates may not be good predictors of cost-effectiveness in current programs.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{national}} guidelines regarding {{infection control}} and management standardize care and improve patient {{and health care}} worker safety. Guidelines such as those provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during the 2009 flu pandemic caused by the H1N1 virus, recommend antiviral treatment regimens, clinical assessment algorithms for coordination of care, and antiviral <b>chemoprophylaxis</b> guidelines for exposed persons, among others. Roles of pharmacists and pharmacies have also expanded {{to meet the needs}} of public during public health emergencies.|$|E
25|$|Tuberculosis {{has been}} treated with {{combination}} therapy for over fifty years. Drugs are not used singly (except in latent TB or <b>chemoprophylaxis),</b> and regimens that use only single drugs result in the rapid development of resistance and treatment failure. The rationale for using multiple drugs to treat TB are based on simple probability. The rate of spontaneous mutations that confer resistance to an individual drug are well known: 1 mutation for every 107 cell divisions for EMB, 1 for every 108 divisions for STM and INH, and 1 for every 1010 divisions for RMP.|$|E

2500|$|The {{protective}} effect of sickle-cell trait {{does not apply}} to people with sickle cell disease; in fact, they are more vulnerable to malaria, since {{the most common cause of}} painful crises in malarial countries is infection with malaria. [...] It has therefore been recommended that people with sickle-cell disease living in malarial countries should receive anti-malarial <b>chemoprophylaxis</b> for life.|$|E
50|$|The cost {{associated}} with <b>chemoprophylaxis</b> may be prohibitive, {{particularly when the}} cost of treatment is high or the incidence of the target disease is low. Many forms of <b>chemoprophylaxis</b> are therefore not cost-effective.|$|E
50|$|Using <b>chemoprophylaxis</b> as a {{treatment}} against early signs of tuberculosis {{has proven to be}} effective. In familial adenomatous polyposis physicians observed polyps regression with NSAIDs for anti-inflammatory therapy. <b>Chemoprophylaxis</b> is also used to treat several different varieties of meningococcal infections for close contact exposure to Neisseria meningitidis.|$|E

50|$|E. canis is {{commonly}} treated via <b>chemoprophylaxis</b> with doxycycline, {{a prescription drug}} used {{in the treatment of}} bacterial infections. If caught before the clinical stage, E. canis is almost completely curable but prolonged presence of the bacteria leads to hemorrhaging which typically results in the death of the patient.|$|E
50|$|The CDC found {{sporadic}} oseltamivir-resistant 2009 H1N1 virus infections {{had been}} identified, including with rare episodes of limited transmission, {{but the public}} health impact had been limited. Those sporadic cases of resistance were found in immunosuppressed patients during oseltamivir treatment and persons who developed illness while receiving oseltamivir <b>chemoprophylaxis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Doxycycline {{has been}} {{provided}} once a week as a prophylaxis to minimize infections during outbreaks in endemic regions. [...] However, {{there is no evidence}} that <b>chemoprophylaxis</b> is effective in containing outbreaks of leptospirosis, and use of antibiotics increases antibiotics resistance. Pre-exposure prophylaxis may be beneficial for individuals traveling to high-risk areas for a short stay.|$|E
50|$|Malaria {{prevention}} {{consists of}} preventing or reducing exposure to mosquitos by using screened rooms, air-conditioning, and nets, {{and use of}} repellents (usually DEET). In addition, <b>chemoprophylaxis</b> is started before travel, {{during the time of}} potential exposure, and for 4 weeks (chloroquine, doxycycline, or mefloquine) or 7 days (atovaquone/proguanil or primaquine) after leaving the risk area. See detailed CDC site.|$|E

50|$|Treatment is {{the same}} as for {{patients}} with sickle cell disease. Patients may receive hydroxyurea to induce the protective effects of increased fetal hemoglobin production. They may also benefit from blood transfusions especially during vaso-occlusive crises. Patients may be offered <b>chemoprophylaxis</b> with penicillin. They may have splenic dysfunction and splenectomy is frequently performed. Vaccination against encapsulated bacteria including Streptococcus pneumoniae is recommended.|$|E
50|$|NMVAC-4 can be {{used for}} {{large-scale}} vaccination programs when an outbreak of meningococcal disease occurs in Africa and other regions of the world. Whenever sporadic or cluster cases or outbreaks of meningococcal disease occur in the US, <b>chemoprophylaxis</b> is the principal means of preventing secondary cases in household and other close contacts of individuals with invasive disease. NMVAC-4 rarely may be used as an adjunct to chemoprophylaxis,1 but only in situations where there is an ongoing risk of exposure (e.g., when cluster cases or outbreaks occur) and when a serogroup contained in the vaccine is involved. It is important that clinicians promptly report all cases of suspected or confirmed meningococcal disease to local public health authorities and that the serogroup of the meningococcal strain involved be identified. The effectiveness of mass vaccination programs depends on early and accurate recognition of outbreaks. When a suspected outbreak of meningococcal disease occurs, public health authorities will then determine whether mass vaccinations (with or without mass <b>chemoprophylaxis)</b> is indicated and delineate the target population to be vaccinated based on risk assessment.|$|E

50|$|Chemoprevention (also <b>Chemoprophylaxis)</b> {{refers to}} the {{administration}} of a medication {{for the purpose of}} preventing disease or infection. Antibiotics, for example, may be administered to patients with disorders of immune system function to prevent bacterial infections (particularly opportunistic infection). Antibiotics may also be administered to healthy individuals to limit the spread of an epidemic, or to patients who have repeated infections (such as urinary tract infections) to prevent recurrence. It may also refer to the administration of heparin to prevent deep venous thrombosis in hospitalized patients.|$|E
5000|$|All {{soldiers}} of the 43rd CSG were command directed to take a weekly dose of 250 MG of Mefloquine Hydrochloride (also known as Lariam or Mefloquine) an orally administered controversial medication used as a malarial <b>chemoprophylaxis.</b> This drug was recently added to the Department of Veterans Affairs War Related Illness and Injury Study Center (WRIISC) as a [...] "Potential Deployment Exposure." [...] This places Mefloquine {{in the same category}} as Agent Orange, Depleted Uranium, Burn Pits and others. Veterans who took Mefloquine should contact their VA Primary Health Care provider or the WRIISC 1-800-248-8005.|$|E
50|$|Tetracycline is {{only used}} in {{combination}} {{for the treatment}} of acute cases of P. falciparum infections. This is due to its slow onset. Unlike doxycycline it is not used in <b>chemoprophylaxis.</b> For tetracycline, 250 mg is the recommended adult dosage (it should not be used in children) for 5 or 7 days depending on the level of adherence and compliance expected. Oesophageal ulceration, gastrointestinal upset and interferences with the process of ossification and depression of bone growth are known to occur. The majority of side effects associated with doxycycline are also experienced.|$|E

50|$|Preventing malaria infections {{developing}} has {{a substantial}} {{effect on the}} potential rate of development of resistance, by directly {{reducing the number of}} cases of malaria thus decreasing the need for anti-malarial therapy.Preventing the transmission of resistant parasites limits the risk of resistant malarial infections becoming endemic and can be controlled by a variety of non-medical methods including insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor residual spraying, environmental controls (such as swamp draining) and personal protective methods such as using mosquito repellent. <b>Chemoprophylaxis</b> is also important in the transmission of malaria infection and resistance in defined populations (for example travellers).|$|E
50|$|Topical retinoids {{have been}} studied in the {{treatment}} of AK with modest results. Treatment with adapalene gel daily for 4 weeks, and then twice daily thereafter for a total of nine months led to a significant but modest reduction in the number AKs compared to placebo; it demonstrated the additional advantage of improving the appearance of photodamaged skin. Topical tretinoin is ineffective as treatment for reducing the number of AKs. For secondary prevention of AK, systemic, low dose acitretin was found to be safe, well-tolerated and moderately effective in <b>chemoprophylaxis</b> for skin cancers in kidney transplant patients.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{agreement}} regarding terminology: the terms preventive therapy and <b>chemoprophylaxis</b> {{have been used}} for decades, and are preferred in the UK because it involves giving medication to people who have no disease and are currently well: the reason for giving medication is primarily to prevent people from becoming unwell. In the U.S., physicians talk about latent tuberculosis treatment because the medication does not actually prevent infection: the person is already infected and the medication is intended to prevent existing silent infection from becoming active disease. There are no convincing reasons to prefer one term over the other.|$|E
50|$|All recent {{contacts}} of {{the infected}} patient over the 7 days before onset should receive medication {{to prevent them}} from contracting the infection. This especially includes young children and their child caregivers or nursery-school contacts, as well as anyone who had direct exposure to the patient through kissing, sharing utensils, or medical interventions such as mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Anyone who frequently ate, slept or stayed at the patient's home during the 7 days before the onset of symptom, or those who sat beside the patient on an airplane flight or classroom for 8 hours or longer, should also receive <b>chemoprophylaxis.</b> The agent of choice is usually oral rifampicin for a few days.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, basic hygiene measures, such as handwashing and not sharing {{drinking}} cups, {{can reduce}} the incidence of infection by limiting exposure. When a case is confirmed, all close contacts with the infected person can be offered antibiotics to reduce the likelihood of the infection spreading to other people. However, rifampin-resistant strains have been reported and the indiscriminate use of antibiotics contributes to this problem. <b>Chemoprophylaxis</b> is commonly used to those close contacts who are at highest risk of carrying the pathogenic strains. Since vaccine duration is unknown, mass select vaccinations may be the most cost-effective means for controlling the transmission of the meningococcal disease, rather than mass routine vaccination schedules.|$|E
