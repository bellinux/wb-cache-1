The closure of the Union paper mill in Skien in 2005 caused a massive outcry, including protests {{from a number of}} politicians. Further closures include the <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>factory</b> in Steti in the Czech Republic, the indefinite <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>factory</b> in South Korea, and the closure of one of the three paper machines at Follum.

This was televised as Sanctuary by Scottish Television in 1973. Baby Love (1973) was written for Leeds Playhouse Theatre where it premiered in March 1973 then transferred to the Soho Polytechnic Lunchtime Theatre. It was a one-act play in which Eileen, after the still birth of her illegitimate baby, steals a baby at random and is sentenced to nine months in prison, where Valium {{is found to be}} the answer.

40|$|We study {{algebraic}} closure and {{its relation}} with definable closure in free groups and more generally in torsion-free hyperbolic groups. Given a torsion-free hyperbolic group G and a nonabelian subgroup <b>A</b> <b>of</b> G, we describe G as a constructible group from the algebraic <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> along cyclic subgroups. In particular, {{it follows that the}} algebraic <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> is finitely generated, quasiconvex and hyperbolic. Suppose that G is free. Then the definable <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> is <b>a</b> free factor <b>of</b> the algebraic <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> and the rank of these groups is bounded by that of G. We prove that the algebraic <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> coincides with the vertex group containing A in the generalized cyclic JSJ-decomposition of G relative to A. If the rank of G is bigger than 4, then G has a subgroup A such that the definable <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> is <b>a</b> proper subgroup <b>of</b> the algebraic <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>A.</b> This answers <b>a</b> question <b>of</b> Sela...|$|R
