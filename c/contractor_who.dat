5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of October 19, 2013, a BART employee and a <b>contractor,</b> <b>who</b> were inspecting tracks, were struck and killed near Walnut Creek by a train being moved for routine maintenance. A labor strike by BART's two major unions was underway at the time, which cause BART to use an undertrained operator. Instead of the usual 14 weeks of the training, the operator only received four. The BART trainer {{was not in the}} cab with the operator at the time of impact but was instead in the passenger compartment. BART was fined $600,000 for the incident.|$|E
5|$|The Incredible Hulk joined Toronto's Green-Screen initiative, to help cut carbon {{emissions}} and waste created during filming. Producer Gale Anne Hurd acknowledged the Hulk, being green, {{was a popular}} environmental analogy, and Norton himself was an environmentalist. Hybrid and fuel efficient vehicles were used, with low sulfur diesel as their energy source. The construction department used a sustainably harvested, locally sourced yellow pine instead of lauan for the sets, and also used zero-or low-VOC paint. The wood was generally recycled or given to environmental organizations, and paint cans were handed to waste management. In addition, they used cloth bags, biodegradable food containers, china and silverware food utensils, a stainless steel mug for each production crew member, a <b>contractor</b> <b>who</b> removed bins, recycled paper, biodegradable soap and cleaners in the trailers and production offices, and the sound department used rechargeable batteries. The Incredible Hulk became the first blockbuster film to receive the Environmental Media Association's Green Seal, which is displayed during the end credits.|$|E

5|$|The south aisle was {{shortened}} {{in about}} 1870 by Scott, and given an apsidal east end, becoming the chapel of St Erasmus. The stained {{glass in the}} apse window is dated 1872 and is by Clayton and Bell. Below this is a mosaic designed by J.R.Clayton and made by Salviati, and a fresco painting by Clayton and Bell, dated 1874. Elsewhere the stained glass in the aisle is by Wailes, and by Hardman & Co. to a design by Pugin. The aisle contains the tomb of Ranulf Higdon, a monk at St Werburgh's Abbey in the 12thcentury who wrote a major work of history entitled Polychronicon, a monument to Thomas Brassey (a civil engineering <b>contractor</b> <b>who</b> died in 1870), designed by Blomfield and made by Wagmuller, a monument to Bishop Peploe who died in 1752, and three painted monuments {{by a member of}} the Randle Holme family.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the relationship between}} bidding competitiveness, organizational learning and experience and it measures the effect of contractors' bidding experience on competitiveness in recurrent bidding, a notion that conceptualizes a continuous decision-making process in which experiential learning plays a key role. The data analysis demonstrates that <b>contractors</b> <b>who</b> bid more frequently over a six-year period are more competitive than <b>contractors</b> <b>who</b> bid occasionally. It is found that greater bidding competitiveness is positively correlated with the frequency of bidding attempts. An analysis of contractors' bidding performance on a pairwise basis supports this finding. Not only does the pairwise analysis show that the bidding competitiveness of experienced <b>contractors</b> <b>who</b> bid frequently is greater, but also that experienced contractors' bidding attempts fall within a relatively small competitiveness range when {{compared with that of}} <b>contractors</b> <b>who</b> only bid occasionally. A key finding of this paper is the existence of some experienced <b>contractors,</b> <b>who</b> may be perceived as being ‘experienced market players’, having the attribute of a more competitive and consistent bidding performance. This research should be useful to procurers looking to prequalify contractors on the basis of experience and to contractors in analysing their bidding performance and/or their competitors' bidding performance.

25|$|Earth scrap is {{material}} that gathers {{around the base}} of the tree. It arises from latex overflowing from the cut and running down the bark, from rain flooding a collection cup containing latex, and from spillage from tappers’ buckets during collection. It contains soil and other contaminants, and has variable rubber content, depending on the amount of contaminants. Earth scrap is collected by field workers two or three times a year and may be cleaned in a scrap-washer to recover the rubber, or sold off to a <b>contractor</b> <b>who</b> cleans it and recovers the rubber. It is of low quality.|$|E
25|$|The series {{focuses on}} the Muslim {{community}} in the fictional prairie town of Mercy, Saskatchewan (population 14,000). The primary institutions of the community are the local mosque, presided over by imam Amaar Rashid and located in the rented parish hall of the town's Anglican church, and Fatima's Café, a downtown diner run by Fatima Dinssa. The community patriarchs are Yasir Hamoudi, a construction <b>contractor</b> <b>who</b> originally fronted the money to establish the mosque under the pretense that he was renting office space for his business, and Baber Siddiqui, a college economics professor {{who served as the}} mosque's temporary imam until Amaar was hired.|$|E
25|$|Consolidation of Locals was {{to address}} the {{regionalization}} of the contracting industry. The <b>contractor</b> <b>who</b> only worked within the local area was quickly becoming {{a thing of the}} past, while non-Union contractors were free to move their crews - experienced with the company’s methods of operation - from job to job, Union Contractors could not move their workers beyond the borders of the District's jurisdictional boundaries without replacing their crews with new carpenters from the jurisdictional district outside the Contractor's home Council. Union contractors rightfully claimed the situation was making them less competitive than the non-Union crews, and the 50% rule was adopted. Union contractors may now use crews with one local Carpenter for each Company Carpenter on jobs outside their Region.|$|E
