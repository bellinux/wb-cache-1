Economists generally agree that to regulate emissions efficiently, all polluters need to face the full costs of their actions (that is, the full marginal social costs of their actions). Regulation of emissions that is applied only to one economic sector or region drastically reduces the efficiency of efforts to reduce global emissions. There is, however, no scientific consensus over how to share the <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> benefits of reducing future climate change (mitigation of climate change), or the <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> benefits of adapting to any future climate change (see also economics of global warming).|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of life cycle <b>costing</b> <b>and</b> value analysis for design of buildings in Sri Lanka. Data were collected from different designers to analyze how the designers' design decisions vary relevant to the life cycle <b>costing</b> <b>and</b> value analysis aspects and to find what are the difficulties faced by the designers {{to use the same}} for their designs. It was found that the most of the designers are willing to change their designs when they are considering the life cycle <b>costing</b> <b>and</b> value analysis aspects for their designs. But, there are some obstructions taking away the designers from using the same for their designs, which are explained under conclusion chapter.

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the {{challenge}} of adaptively controlling a home heating system in order to minimise <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> carbon emissions within a smart grid. Our home energy management agent learns the thermal properties of the home, and uses Gaussian processes to predict the environmental parameters over the next 24 hours, allowing it to provide real time feedback to householders concerning the <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> carbon emissions of their heating preferences. Furthermore, we show how it can then use a mixed-integer quadratic program, or a computationally efficient greedy heuristic, to adapt to real-time <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> carbon intensity signals, adjusting the timing of heater use {{in order to satisfy}} preferences for comfort whilst minimising <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> carbon emissions. We evaluate our approach using weather and electricity grid data from January 2010 for the UK, and show our approach can predict the total <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> carbon emissions over a day to within 9 %, and show that over the month it reduces <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> carbon emissions by 15 %, and 9 %, respectively, compared to using a conventional thermostat...|$|R
40|$|Purpose:- The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{identify}} <b>and</b> compare <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> carbon critical elements of two office buildings and to help achieve an optimum balance between building Capital <b>cost</b> (CC) <b>and</b> Embodied Carbon (EC). Design/methodology/approach: - Case study approach was employed to study <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> carbon critical elements of two office buildings as it allows an in-depth and holistic investigation. Elemental estimates of CC and EC were prepared from BoQs of the two buildings by obtaining rates from the UK Building Blackbook. Pareto Principle (80 : 20 rule) was used to identify carbon <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> critical elements of the two buildings and the significance hierarchies of building elements were compared. Findings:- Substructure, Frame and Services were identified as both carbon <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> critical elements responsible for more than 70 % of the total CC and EC in both buildings. Stairs and Ramps, Internal Doors and Fittings, Furnishings and Equipment were identified to be the least carbon <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> significant elements contributing less than 2 % of total CC and EC in both buildings. The hierarchy of <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> carbon significance varies between buildings due to the difference in the specification and design. Originality/value:- The increasing significance of dual currency (<b>cost</b> <b>and</b> carbon) demands <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> carbon management during the early stages of projects. Hence, this paper suggests that focusing on carbon <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> intensive building elements is a way forward to keep both <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> carbon under control during the early stages of projects...|$|R
