By applying method of Artificial Neural Networking (ANN) using back propagation (BP) algorithm, prediction model has been developed to predict CSR. Important blast furnace functions such as permeability, heat exchanging, melting, and reducing capacity are mostly connected to <b>coke</b> <b>quality.</b> <b>Coke</b> <b>quality</b> is further dependent upon coal characterization and coke making process parameters. The ANN model developed is {{a useful tool for}} process experts to adjust the control parameters in case of <b>coke</b> <b>quality</b> deviations. The model also makes it possible to predict CSR for new coal blends which are yet to be used in Coke Plant.

30|$|This {{study has}} {{demonstrated}} {{the limitations of}} existing approaches of implementing the vitrinite reflectance distribution within a <b>coke</b> <b>quality</b> prediction model. The approach used within this work captured these distributions using a self-organizing map, generating a new parameter, the vitrinite distribution category (VDC), and identified that these distributions provide insight into blending decisions. The introduction of this parameter improved the fit of a regression model for <b>coke</b> <b>quality</b> prediction, and identified that blends of distinctly different rank coals were poorly fitted by models assuming the aggregate value of vitrinite reflectance. Residual analysis suggested that these blending behaviors {{are influenced by the}} underlying coals, and that none of the parameters considered within this modelling account for this behavior. Whilst the development of the VDC parameter improves the understanding of blending decisions on <b>coke</b> <b>quality</b> prediction, further study is required to identify and interpret the properties associated with particular coals that are affecting accurate prediction of <b>coke</b> <b>quality.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{weathering}} on the modification of chemical, petrological and rheological properties of four metallurgical coals in different rank and geology was investigated. And that of <b>coke</b> <b>qualities</b> of these coals was investigated by 25 kg pilot coke oven. Weathering tests {{were carried out}} by storing coal in 20 ton pile on an open industrial yard for up to 208 days. Coal characteristics and <b>coke</b> <b>qualities</b> were monitored over an interval of one month. The mixture of four metallurgical coals was used to investigate the effect of weathering duration on the modification of coal blending as well. With increasing weathering, oxygen concentration was increased as expected, and calorific values were marginally decreased. This study confirmed the adverse effect of weathering on the caking properties of coals such as fluidity, dilation and swelling behaviours as well as coal melting temperature range. The study illustrated that effect of short term and long term weathering on the modification of rheological properties of coals is significantly different. Unlike general idea like low rank coals normally get greater impact of weathering than high rank coals, {{this study suggests that}} long term weathering may have a strong impact on the modification of rheological properties of relatively higher rank coals with high ash yield. With increasing weathering time, inert textures and small pores increased, while calorific values of all cokes marginally decreased. The coke cold strength from weathered coals decreased as well as their size. However the rank of coals and fluidity loss didn't show clear relationship with this quality drop. On the other hand, the coke size decreased in accordance with the fluidity drop. The fluidity of coal blending remained stable for a while, and then it dropped seriously according to weathering time with narrowed fluid ranges of individual coals. Coke strength of coal blending in both cold and hot state decreased significantly and continuously. Therefore, this study suggests that even though the individual coals may not be affected seriously by weathering, the weathering effects can be severe when different rank coals are use together...|$|R

30|$|The {{accurate}} {{prediction of}} <b>coke</b> <b>quality</b> {{is important for}} the selection and valuation of metallurgical coals. Whilst many prediction models exist, they tend to perform poorly for coals beyond which the model was developed. Further, these models general fail to directly account for physical interactions occurring between the blend components, through the assumption that the aggregate properties of the blend are suitably representative of the overall behavior of the blend. To study this assumption, a parameter termed the vitrinite distribution category was introduced to directly account for the distribution of one of these commonly aggregated parameters, the vitrinite reflectance. The introduction of this parameter in a regression model for <b>coke</b> <b>quality</b> prediction improved the model fit. The vitrinite distribution category was demonstrated to provide new information about coal blending decisions, and was found to be capable of providing insight into the behavior of different blending structures. Residual analysis was applied to explore the behavior of the <b>coke</b> <b>quality</b> prediction model, with the vitrinite distribution category found to explain more than just {{the presence or absence of}} coals within a blend. This work provides the foundation of future studies in examining coal blending decisions, with the proposed parameter having the potential to be applied as part of a <b>coke</b> <b>quality</b> prediction model to optimize coal blending decisions.|$|E

40|$|The {{implementation}} of pulverized coal injection technology {{has resulted in}} the reduction in the amounts of coke being used in the blast furnace, which has led to increased demands for high quality cokes to provide enhanced performance. Under the twin pressures of resource shortage of coking coals and continuous requirements for improved <b>coke</b> <b>quality,</b> an in-depth understanding of coke behavior in blast furnace has become very important and pertinent. This review article is focused on a comprehensive investigation on the evolution of structural order, microstructure and mineral matter of metallurgical coke in a blast furnace and presents various mechanisms of coke degradation during its descent in a blast furnace toward establishing reference standards for <b>coke</b> <b>quality</b> and performance. Coke structure, microstructure and reactivity were investigated as a function of temperature, its location in the blast furnace and under the influence of alkalis above the tuyere level. The transformation of coke in the blast furnace hearth and its dissolution into hot metal were also reviewed. The current indices for evaluating <b>coke</b> <b>quality</b> were examined based on the modifications of coke structure, and several unresolved issues in the field requiring further research were identified. This literature survey has shown that while crystalline order and microstructure had a strong influence on carburization, gasification reactions and the strength of coke, factors such as mineral matter, alkalis, temperature were among some of the important factors that affected the degradation of coke in a blast furnace. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Due to {{increasing}} price and economic pressures, {{there is a}} need to minimise coke consumption. The lesser amount of coke used has indirectly set higher standards for <b>coke</b> <b>quality</b> and led to a wish for even more knowledge about its function in the blast furnace. Over the last 20 years, <b>coke</b> <b>quality</b> has been strongly dictated by the so- called CSR value because it was believed that a higher CSR leads to improvement in productivity and more stable operation. Due to lack of suitable coals, often cokes are made from coals with relatively inferior coals leading to coke with lower values of the so-called CRI indicia. Because of this, there was an indirect focus on cokes with lower CRI values. Therefore, this thesis will address some of the important issues of coke strength and focus on changes occurring with coke when it passes through a blast furnace. The main aim of this study is to understand the degradation mechanisms and reactivity changes of coke in order to investigate the factors that affect <b>coke</b> <b>quality.</b> Cokes excavated from LKAB's Experimental Blast Furnace (EBF) are used as a basis for the research. Two campaigns with similar coke (low CRI/high CSR) but different blast furnace injection material have been studied. The coke is supplied from SSAB Tunnplåt Luleå AB. Physical and chemical properties of cokes samples from the EBF were measured. Evolution of coke properties particularly carbon structure and alkali uptake were related to CO 2 reactivity as well as coke behaviour (e. g. CSR/abrasion). In addition to this, a trial with very high CRI coke was studied. On the basis of this study, following conclusions were made. The order of carbon structure and concentration of alkali species were increased and these were the most notable changes in the coke properties as it passed through shaft to the cohesive zone of the EBF. The degree of graphitisation was increased while amorphous carbon content was decreased in the hotter zones of the EBF. A linear correlation between the height of the carbon crystallite (Lc) values and the coke bed temperature was established to demonstrate the strong effect of temperature on the carbon crystallite value (Lc) of coke in the EBF. The alkali concentration of coke increased with increasing temperature of the coke bed such that most of the alkali content was evenly distributed in the bulk of the coke rather than in the periphery of the coke matrix. The CO 2 reactivity of coke was found to increase during progressive movement of the coke from shaft to cohesive zone of the EBF, and was related to the catalytic effect of increased alkali concentration in coke. The deterioration of <b>coke</b> <b>quality</b> in the EBF, particularly coke strength (CSR) and abrasion propensity (I drum test), was related to coke graphitisation, alkalization and reactivity to demonstrate the strong effect of the coke graphitisation on the propensity of coke degradation. Differential Thermal Analysis indicated that reactions with CO 2 are enhanced as coke descends through the EBF. In addition, a trial period with poor <b>coke</b> <b>quality</b> was studied by extensive sampling. The results from this study gave the following additional conclusions: Comparison between high and poor quality coke indicate structure to be connected with alkali uptake, reaction with CO 2 and degradation. Isotropic coke carbon components are more resistant than anisotropic components when passing through the EBF. Both cokes develop a more ordered structure as they descend through the EBF.

The chemical changes due to oxidation were studied by applying Gieseler plastometry, the free-swelling index (FSI), thermogravimetric analysis and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). In general, oxidation at 50 °C produced a greater impairment of coking properties, the different responses to oxidation depending on the parent coal. The main effects caused by oxidation were a loss of thermoplastic properties, a decrease in aliphatic hydrogen and {{a slight increase in}} groups with oxygen functionalities.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the effects of the composition of mixed plastic wastes on the thermoplastic properties of coal, the generation of coking pressure {{and the quality of the}} resulting cokes in a movable wall oven at semipilot scale. The mixed plastic wastes were selected to cover a wide spectrum in the relative proportions of high- and low-density polyethylenes (HDPE and LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). From the results it was deduced that the reduction in Gieseler fluidity in the coal blend is linked to the total amount of polyolefins in the waste. It was also found that these thermoplastics increase the pressure exerted against the wall in the course of the coking process and that <b>coke</b> <b>quality</b> is maintained or even improved. However, when the level of aromatic polymers such PS and PET are increased at the expense of polyolefins, the coking pressure decreases. Thus, the amount of aromatic polymers such as PS and PET in the waste is critical, not only for controlling Gieseler fluidity and coking pressure, but also for avoiding deterioration in <b>coke</b> <b>quality</b> (reactivity towards CO CRI and mechanical strength of the partially-gasified coke CSR).

These new methods involve the modification of coal blends and the incorporation, as secondary raw materials, of organic industrial waste and biomass, classified as zero emissions of CO 2. Biomass and charcoal are products of great interest, the latter form a significant part of this work. Accordingly this work explores the addition of charcoal to coal blends for the production of coke and the production of Fe-Coque briquettes with unexpensive materials such as iron ore fines and coals with poor coking properties. In order to follow the modifications that coal undergoes during its transformation to coke, this doctoral thesis uses optical microscopy and other additional techniques to trace the transformations of coal macerals during the carbonization process, and to define their relation to their thermoplastic behavior with special emphasis on organic components, traditionally considered as inert. In order to achieve this goal, coals typically used in the production of metallurgical coke of different rank, maceral composition, chemical and thermoplastic properties, and geographic origin, are characterized by scan analysis at maceral level.
