5000|$|In 2007, an {{important}} discovery was made which enabled {{a slew of}} activity to help scientists, historians and gemologists further explore {{the history of the}} Hope Diamond, as well as create replicas of the larger pieces, from which it had been cut, believed to have been owned by eighteenth-century French monarchs. A lead cast of the French Blue diamond was discovered in the gemmological collections of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, reported in a bilingual French - English press release, and the unique finding triggered an investigation by an international team of researchers into the stone's history. It was {{an important}} event since previously investigators had to rely on two-dimensional sketches of the diamond, but now they had a three-dimensional structure with which to apply techniques such as <b>computer-aided</b> <b>drawing</b> analysis. It allowed creation of the first numeric reconstruction of the French Blue including a virtual snapshot video. Even the emblem of the Golden Fleece of Louis XV was numerically reconstructed around the French Blue, including the [...] "Côte de Bretagne" [...] spinel of 107 carat g, the [...] "Bazu" [...] diamond of 32.62 carat g, 3 oriental topazes (yellow sapphires), five brillants of up to 5 carat mg brillants and nearly 300 smaller diamonds. Special care was taken to reconstruct the major gemstones precisely by using CAD analysis as well as knowledge of historical gemsetting techniques. As part of the investigation, the [...] "Tavernier Blue" [...] diamond was also reconstructed from the original French edition of Tavernier's Voyages (rather than the later London edition that somewhat distorted and modified Tavernier's original figures), and the Smithsonian Institution provided ray-tracing and optical spectroscopic data about the Hope diamond. These events culminated in an event and a documentary to celebrate the making of these replicas, with celebrations by the French museum including H. Horovitz, Martin du Daffoy who was the historian and jeweller from the Place Vendôme in Paris, as well as directors and leaders from the museum. The event was filmed by Gédéon programmes for a documentary on the French Blue diamond, to be presented by 2011 worldwide.|$|E

[...] Many schools of architecture claim to balance art with science. It does this by juxtaposing our involvement {{in the community of}} artists, designers and architects that comprises the GSA, with their own dedicated science-led 'green' research unit within the school - MEARU (Mackintosh Environmental Architecture Research Unit). This research unit is also increasingly taking on consultancy to practitioners at feasibility or early design stage, which is then fed into the teaching from first year to postgraduate level. [...] The School collaborates in teaching with the world recognised Department of Urban Studies at Glasgow University, and runs a studio based courses for students of engineering for the universities of Glasgow and Paisley. [...] The Mac's teaching staff come {{from a wide variety of}} backgrounds and specialist subject areas and are all active in research, teaching development. The School also offers consultancy services and where possible this has involved students and staff in a number of commissions, the results of which are often fed back into the teaching and learning environment. [...] The School was recently awarded the highest rating classification by the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) for the quality of its teaching, and in the last research assessment exercise The Glasgow School of Art's research activity was noted as being of national importance. [...] At the Mackintosh School of Architecture, the emphasis is on student-centred learning, which means involving students in a wide range of experiences and exercises where the individual progressively is encouraged to develop their own direction and solutions. This is achieved through set studio design projects, supported by both full-time studio tutors and leading practitioners, in a rigorous but supportive critical environment. [...] The curriculum is organised in Five Stages, covering design, construction, structures, environmental science, history, sociology, economics, law and management, as well as skills in hand drawing, <b>computer-aided</b> <b>drawing,</b> three-dimensional visualisation, modelmaking and workshop techniques, photography, audiovisual and verbal presentation, and core skills including problem solving and working with other people. [...] Students present their studio work for review by a group of their peers, staff and invited critics. The staff give a formative assessment from the reviews and a summative assessment at the end of the academic year, with continuous feedback from tutorials. The lecture courses are assessed by essay, coursework and formal written examinations. The courses contained within the programmes are necessarily wide ranging, to nurture aptitude, enthusiasm and commitment for the demands of professional practice in the contemporary world. [...] Complementing the studio-based work, there are integrated lectures, seminars and practical courses taught by both full-time and visiting lecturers. The Mackintosh School attracts the foremost international architects, designers and critics, adding value to the teaching and learning opportunities throughout the course, and balanced by a programme of staff and student exchanges with leading international schools in Australia, Barcelona, Berlin, Lusanne, Madrid, Mendrisio, Paris, Urbana-Champaign, and Vienna. Students also become involved in live projects, field and study visits, research and competitions.

40|$|My {{research}} is centred upon how architecture is invigorated by cyberspace, the blurred {{boundary between the}} virtual and the actual, and how the different parameters of these spaces {{can be used to}} inform one another. My early experience in practice was that buildings are limited by the inert materials used to construct them and by the unimaginative ideas of what a building should look like and be. My research draws upon a variety of different disciplines to inform one – architecture. The areas of research are multidisciplinary and include the changing status of the architectural <b>drawing,</b> smart materials, <b>computer-aided</b> architectural <b>drawing,</b> <b>computer-aided</b> manufacture, emergent systems, responsive environments, the architectural design of cyberspace, interactivity, cybernetics and evolving systems and algorithmic design. To create responsive, non-prescriptive designs for architectural intervention was the starting point that led to an interest in the logic of algorithms and open-ended systems. These problem-solving diagrams used by computer programmers are very useful as a way of describing fluctuating conditions in responsive environments. This led to an interest in other computing paradigms such as cellular automata, complexity and emergence. These and other ideas I attempted to bring into the arena of architectural design to help architects cope with the rapid growth of computational technology, which is starting to revolutionize the way buildings are designed, drawn and built. We are at another of the important perturbations in technology and epistemology that seems to affect us so often these days. Cell biology is the new cyber-space and nanotechnology.

An online experimental survey tool is developed to investigate lifestyle preferences and tradeoffs that households make in their location decisions. This <b>computer-aided</b> experimental survey <b>draws</b> upon stated preference methods to engage participants in questions about residential location and transportation options. The survey infrastructure was extensively piloted (6 - 10 % response rate). The 10 -minute survey can be deployed for future investigations. This infrastructure is a contribution for the integration of visualized neighborhood typologies, or concepts, which were objectively defined using data from 25 of the most populous metropolitan regions from around the United States. The construct of neighborhoods is based upon national data to account for potential options not currently available in Oregon. These visualizations help ground the survey respondents in the same reality and were carefully crafted to convey various attributes of the built and transportation environment. The initial analysis of the preference data collected in this survey (N= 1, 035) indicates that the preferences for neighborhood, housing, and transportation characteristics have a greater influence on the preferred neighborhood concept than the more typically used socio-economic characteristics (income, household size, age). Another interesting preliminary finding is that 27 % of respondents would prefer {{to live in a}} more urban neighborhood than they currently reside.

40|$|A {{timeline}} juxtaposing {{examples of}} trademarks registered in Australia and milestones {{in the development}} of computer graphics hardware and software during the years 1950 - 2000 is used to investigate two propositions about the relationship between software tools and visual culture.

This idea is similar to and supportive of Geoffrey Batchen’s (1999) assertion that the desire for photography in Western culture is documented as preceding photography’s invention. The other proposition is that the capabilities offered by software tools have conditioned the architectonic form and therefore the stylistic outcome of the resultant artifacts. However, the cause and effect supposition embedded in the latter proposition is eminently debatable...|$|E
40|$|This work {{undertakes}} {{a systematic}} study of various elements from differing fields which {{apply to the}} construction of <b>computer-aided</b> instructional systems. <b>Drawing</b> upon these works, the potential for instruction in computer adventure games is recognised, and previous work in the area analysed with respect to the theoretical findings. Based both on this theory and the germane advice of practicing game designers, a methodology for the design of educational computer adventure games is laid out in detail. The method described is then used to construct a sample game with basic programming skills as the pedagogical content, and this sample game is tested and the results examined. An informed approach to the design of computer-assisted instruction must begin with an understanding of how people acquire and store new information or skills. Cognitive psychology provides a number of conflicting models of the human information processing system, but these differing theories have a common basis which can be exploited in an attempt to make material more accessible. Instructional design describes a methodology for the analysis of pedagogical goals and demonstrates methods of learning support which can and should be incorporated into the new setting. In this field also is a judgement of different media, including computers, and their ability to provide the necessary elements of learning. By understanding {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the medium the limits of what is possible within it can be catered to, and its failings augmented with supplemental materials. Both educational psychology and instructional design indicate benefits to learning from a correctly motivated learner, and the theory of engagement is therefore also scrutinised for elements helpful to the educational designer. The convergence of the knowledge gleaned from these various fields leads to one possible match to the desired criteria for computer-mediated instruction; the computerised fantasy adventure game. This being the case, other work in the field is examined for relevance, and it is found that a detailed methodology for the construction of such games does not exist. Existing material is combined with the aforementioned theoretical work and a survey of what is known about practical game design to create such a framework. It is proposed that through its use the systematic inclusion of educational content in an engaging environment will be facilitated. The hypothesis is examined, and an action research approach found to be called for. As such, the proposed methodology is used to create a sample game, and the process of its design used to inform the proposed methodology. The final form is described in detail, and the process of its application to the sample game elucidated. A prototype of the game is used with a number of test subjects to evaluate the game's level of success at both engagement and the imparting of content material...|$|R

Three extensive experiments with and without a cloud computing environment were compared.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to synthetic (<b>computer-aided)</b> <b>drawing</b> with patches of strokes. Grouped strokes convey the local intensity level that is desired in drawing. The key point of our approach is learning by example: the system does not know a priori the distribution of the strokes. Instead, by analyzing a sample (training) patch of strokes, our system is able to synthesize freely an arbitrary sequence of strokes that "looks like" the given sample. Strokes are considered as parametrical curves represented by a vector of random variables following a Markovian distribution. Our method is based on Shannon's N-gram approach and is a direct extension of Efros's texture synthesis models [EL 99; EF 01]. Nevertheless, one major difference between our method and traditional texture synthesis is the use of such curves as a basic element instead of pixels. We define a statistical metric for comparison between different patches containing various layouts of strokes. We hope that our method performs a first step towards capturing a very difficult notion of style in drawing [...] hatching style in our case. We illustrate our method by varied examples, ranging from typical hatching in traditional drawing to highly heterogeneous sets of strokes...|$|E

The design concept generated then was analyzed using the matrix chart. All parameters and factor that related to customer satisfaction such as easy to maintenance or easy to uses was analyzed. The design concept that gave highest marks during analysis stage was selected as a final design. The structural three-dimensional solid modeling for final design concept that has been selected was developed using the <b>computer-aided</b> <b>drawing</b> software namely Solidwork. All the factors that need to consider was taken during material selection for fabrication stage. The factor was considered for material selection such as lightweight, not rust, hardness, cheap, and others are taken for fabrication process. After fabrication process, the final product has been tested {{to ensure that the}} product is functional or not. If the product is not following specification, some modification will be made. The modification process will be repeating until the products achieve the desire specification...|$|E
40|$|Project-based {{learning}} (PBL) is {{a well-known}} student-centred methodology for engineering design education. The methodology claims to offer a number of educational benefits. This paper evaluates the student perceptions of the initial and second offering of a first-year design unit at Griffith University in Australia. It builds on an earlier evaluation conducted after the initial offering of the unit. It considers {{the implementation of the}} recommended changes. Evaluations of the two offerings reveal that students (in both the initial and second offering) generally enjoyed the experience, but that the second offering was found to be a significantly more enjoyable learning experience. Students in the second offering also reported a significantly better understanding of what they needed to do for the design projects and where to find the requisite information. The oral presentation aspect of the initial and second offerings received the lowest satisfaction rating. The inclusion (and delivery) of the <b>computer-aided</b> <b>drawing</b> component of the unit is seen as a positive aspect by some students, but many others comment on it negatively. The best aspects of the PBL unit and those aspects needing further improvement were similar to the findings of other investigations documented in the literature.
