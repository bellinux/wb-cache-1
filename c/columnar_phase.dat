5|$|The {{content of}} water or other solvent {{molecules}} changes the self-assembled structures. At very low amphiphile concentration, the molecules will be dispersed randomly without any ordering. At slightly higher (but still low) concentration, amphiphilic molecules will spontaneously assemble into micelles or vesicles. This is done so as to 'hide' the hydrophobic tail of the amphiphile inside the micelle core, exposing a hydrophilic (water-soluble) surface to aqueous solution. These spherical objects do not order themselves in solution, however. At higher concentration, the assemblies will become ordered. A typical phase is a hexagonal <b>columnar</b> <b>phase,</b> where the amphiphiles form long cylinders (again with a hydrophilic surface) that arrange themselves into a roughly hexagonal lattice. This is called the middle soap phase. At still higher concentration, a lamellar phase (neat soap phase) may form, wherein extended sheets of amphiphiles are separated by thin layers of water. For some systems, a cubic (also called viscous isotropic) phase may exist between the hexagonal and lamellar phases, wherein spheres are formed that create a dense cubic lattice. These spheres may also be connected to one another, forming a bicontinuous cubic phase.|$|E

Previous {{studies have shown}} a strong tendency of smectic phases of these mixtures to segregate and, in some circumstances, to form microsegregated phases. Our focus in the present work is on the formation of <b>columnar</b> <b>phases</b> which some studies, under some approximations, have shown to become thermodynamically stable prior to crystallization. Specifically {{we focus on the}} relative stability between smectic and <b>columnar</b> <b>phases,</b> a question not fully addressed in previous work. Our analysis is based on two complementary perspectives: on the one hand, an extended Onsager theory, which includes the full orientational degrees of freedom but with spatial and orientational correlations being treated in an approximate manner; on the other hand, we formulate a Zwanzig approximation of fundamental-measure theory on hard parallelepipeds, whereby orientations are restricted to be only along three mutually orthogonal axes, but correlations are faithfully represented. In the latter case novel, complete phase diagrams containing regions of stability of liquid-crystalline phases are calculated. Our findings indicate that the restricted-orientation approximation enhances the stability of <b>columnar</b> <b>phases</b> so as to preempt smectic order completely while, in the framework of the extended Onsager model, with full orientational degrees of freedom taken into account, <b>columnar</b> <b>phases</b> may preempt a large region of smectic stability in some mixtures, but some smectic order still persists.

40|$|DNA {{and certain}} species of {{cationic}} and neutral lipids self-assemble into lamellar complexes when mixed in water. X-ray scattering experiments {{have determined that}} these complexes are highly organized with DNA molecules located in the galleries between lipid bilayers. Within each gallery, DNA molecules form a two-dimensional (2 D) smectic lattice. We model the lipid and DNA complexes as three-dimensional stacks of weakly-coupled 2 D smectic lattices and study the phase diagram of this model {{as a function of}} temperature. The various phases are distinguished by the strength of the translational and orientational correlations between neighboring smectic lattices. For example, it is possible for a <b>columnar</b> <b>phase</b> to form at low temperature with long-range translational correlations between smectic lattices. In the <b>columnar</b> <b>phase,</b> the DNA molecules form a 2 D crystal lattice in the plane perpendicular to their column axes, and there is a nonzero shear modulus for sliding neighboring lattices relative to each other. As temperature is increased, thermal fluctuations may induce a second-order phase transition to the sliding <b>columnar</b> <b>phase.</b> This phase is characterized by strong in-plane smectic correlations, a vanishing shear modulus for sliding lattices across each other, and a nonvanishing orientational rigidity for rotating lattices relative to each other. Thus, neighboring lattices are able to slide but not rotate relative to each other without energy cost. We calculate several important structural properties of the sliding <b>columnar</b> <b>phase,</b> for instance, the sliding columnar density-density correlation and structure functions. The sliding columnar correlation function is unique in that in-plane correlations are weaker than any power-law and decay with separation r as exp[– ln 2 r]. We also calculate the energy cost for edge dislocations in the sliding <b>columnar</b> <b>phase</b> and show that, at the longest lengthscales, a dislocation unbinding transition from the columnar to the nematic lamellar phase precludes the columnar to sliding <b>columnar</b> <b>phase</b> transition. However, if further-neighbor orientational interactions between smectic lattices are permitted, there is a temperature range where the sliding <b>columnar</b> <b>phase</b> is thermodynamically stable. ...|$|E
