5|$|India {{is facing}} a growing cancer epidemic, with a large {{increase}} in the number of women with breast cancer. By the year 2020 nearly 70 percent of the world’s cancer <b>cases</b> <b>will</b> come from developing countries, with a fifth of those cases coming from India.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the areas}} {{affected}} are exposed skin not usually protected by clothing; however {{it can also}} occur in areas covered by clothing. Areas constantly subjected to the sun's rays may only be slightly affected if at all. People with extreme <b>cases</b> <b>will</b> also have reactions to light bulbs that emit a UV wavelength (any bulb {{that is not an}} LED). Parts of the body only thinly covered can also potentially be subjected to an outbreak.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol poisoning, {{also known}} as {{acetaminophen}} poisoning, is caused by excessive use of the medication paracetamol (acetaminophen). Most people have few or non-specific symptoms in the first 24hours following overdose. This may include feeling tired, abdominal pain, or nausea. This is typically followed {{by a couple of}} days without any symptoms after which yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, and confusion occurs. Additional complications may include kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, and lactic acidosis. If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks. Without treatment some <b>cases</b> <b>will</b> resolve while others will result in death.|$|E
25|$|For {{the most}} serious crimes, the <b>case</b> <b>will</b> not be {{directly}} prosecuted by the procurator fiscal. Instead, the <b>case</b> <b>will</b> be heard at the High Court of Justiciary and the prosecution will {{be made in the}} name of the Lord Advocate by an Advocate Depute.|$|R

5|$|Poliomyelitis {{has existed}} for {{thousands}} of years, with depictions of the disease in ancient art. The disease was first recognized as a distinct condition by Michael Underwood in 1789 and {{the virus that causes}} it was first identified in 1908 by Karl Landsteiner. Major outbreaks started to occur in the late 19th century in Europe and the United States. In the 20th century it {{became one of the most}} worrying childhood diseases in these areas. The first polio vaccine was developed in the 1950s by Jonas Salk. It is hoped that vaccination efforts and early detection of <b>cases</b> <b>will</b> result in global eradication of the disease by 2018.|$|E
5|$|The ICSID {{does not}} conduct {{arbitration}} or conciliation proceedings itself, but offers institutional and procedural support to conciliation commissions, tribunals, and other committees which conduct such matters. The center has {{two sets of}} rules that determine how <b>cases</b> <b>will</b> be initiated and conducted, either under the ICSID's Convention, Regulations and Rules or the ICSID's Additional Facility Rules. To be processed {{in accordance with the}} ICSID Convention, a legal dispute has to exist between one of the center's contracting member states and a national of another contracting member state. It must also be of a legal nature and relate directly to an investment. A case can be processed under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules if one of the parties to the dispute is either not a contracting member state or a national of a contracting member state. However, most cases are arbitrated under the ICSID Convention. Recourse to ICSID conciliation and arbitration is entirely voluntary. However, once the parties have consented to arbitration under the ICSID Convention, neither party can unilaterally withdraw its consent.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} {{is good for}} stable lesions (stageI and II) in juveniles with open growth plates; treated conservatively—typically without surgery—50% of <b>cases</b> <b>will</b> heal. Recovery in juveniles {{can be attributed to}} the bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. Open growth plates are characterized by increased numbers of undifferentiated chondrocytes (stem cells) which are precursors to both bone and cartilaginous tissue. As a result, open growth plates allow for more of the stem cells necessary for repair in the affected joint. Unstable, large, full-thickness lesions (stageIII and IV) or lesions of any stage found in the skeletally mature are more likely to fail non-operative treatment. These lesions offer a worse prognosis and surgery is required in most cases.|$|E

25|$|The {{incidence}} of ITP {{is estimated at}} 50100 new cases per million per year, with children accounting for half of that amount. At least 70 percent of childhood <b>cases</b> <b>will</b> end up in remission within six months, even without treatment. Moreover, {{a third of the}} remaining chronic <b>cases</b> <b>will</b> usually remit during follow-up observation, and another third will end up with only mild thrombocytopenia (defined as a platelet count above 50,000). A number of immune related genes and polymorphisms have been identified as influencing predisposition to ITP, with FCGR3a-V158 allele and KIRDS2/DL2 increasing susceptibility and KIR2DS5 shown to be protective.|$|E

25|$|Cases, {{especially}} bottleneck <b>cases,</b> <b>will</b> stretch upon firing. How much a {{case will}} stretch depends upon load pressure, cartridge design, chamber size, functional cartridge headspace (usually {{the most important}} factor), and other variables. Periodically cases need to be trimmed {{to bring them back}} into proper specifications. Most reloading manuals list both a trim size and a max length. Long cases can create a safety hazard through improper headspace and possible increased pressure.|$|E
25|$|High ringbone: The horse {{will have}} a bony growth around the pastern area, and the pastern will have less mobility. The horse will show pain when the pastern joint is moved or rotated. Early <b>cases</b> <b>will</b> have a {{lameness}} score of 1-2 out of 5, {{with little or no}} bony swelling seen, although possibly felt when compared to the opposite pastern. Lameness will worsen to a grade 2-3 on a scale of 5 as the ringbone worsens.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} no {{medications}} available to treat amnesia, underlying medical conditions can be treated to improve memory. Such conditions include {{but are not limited}} to low thyroid function, liver or kidney disease, stroke, depression, bipolar disorder and blood clots in the brain. Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome involves a lack of thiamin and replacing this vitamin by consuming thiamin-rich foods such as whole-grain cereals, legumes (beans and lentils), nuts, lean pork, and yeast. Treating alcoholism and preventing alcohol and illicit drug use can prevent further damage, but in most <b>cases</b> <b>will</b> not recover lost memory.|$|E

25|$|The Shiba is a {{relatively}} fastidious breed and feels {{the need to maintain}} itself in a clean state. They can often be seen licking their paws and legs, much like a cat. They generally {{go out of their way}} to keep their coats clean. Because of their fastidious and proud nature, Shiba puppies are easy to housebreak and in many <b>cases</b> <b>will</b> housebreak themselves. Having their owner simply place them outside after meal times and naps is generally enough to teach the Shiba the appropriate method of toileting.|$|E
25|$|The current trend {{appears to}} be that DNA barcoding needs to be used {{alongside}} traditional taxonomic tools and alternative forms of molecular systematics so that problem cases can be identified and errors detected. Non-cryptic species can generally be resolved by either traditional or molecular taxonomy without ambiguity. However, more difficult <b>cases</b> <b>will</b> only yield {{to a combination of}} approaches. And finally, as most of the global biodiversity remains unknown, molecular barcoding can only hint at the existence of new taxa, but not delimit or describe them (DeSalle, 2006; Rubinoff, 2006).|$|E
25|$|The American Cancer Society {{estimates}} that in 2014, about 5,980 {{new cases of}} chronic myelogenous leukemia were diagnosed, and about 810 people died of the disease. This means that a little over 10% of all newly diagnosed leukemia <b>cases</b> <b>will</b> be chronic myelogenous leukemia. The average risk of a person getting this disease is 1 in 588. The disease {{is more common in}} men than women, and more common in whites than African-Americans. The average age at diagnosis is 64 years, and this disease is rarely seen in children.|$|E

25|$|When an {{arbitrary}} {{beam of light}} strikes {{the surface of a}} birefringent material, the polarizations corresponding to the ordinary and extraordinary rays generally take somewhat different paths. Unpolarized light consists of equal amounts of energy in any two orthogonal polarizations, and even polarized light (except in special <b>cases)</b> <b>will</b> have some energy in each of these polarizations. According to Snell's law of refraction, the angle of refraction will be governed by the effective refractive index which is different between these two polarizations. This is clearly seen, for instance, in the Wollaston prism which is designed to separate incoming light into two linear polarizations using a birefringent material such as calcite.|$|E
25|$|As these spiders live in {{constant}} proximity to humans, {{they are not}} usually aggressive and will even let a human hand approach their web. Like any other spider, however, {{they are afraid of}} bigger foes, and, in most <b>cases,</b> <b>will</b> retreat behind an obstacle (such as a dried leaf or prey remains) upon perceiving more than usual disturbance to their web. Further disturbance may lead to the spider dropping down on a thread, then running away from the web. If the distance is not considerable, it will usually return to its web within a couple of days. Otherwise, it will start a new one.|$|E
25|$|State {{government}} funded redress schemes {{have made}} or are planning ex-gratia payments to Forgotten Australians in some states. In Queensland, payments {{were made in}} 2009 ranging from $7,000 to $40,000. In Western Australia, payments were expected to range from $10,000 to $80,000 and were {{to be made in}} 2010. The maximum payment may be limited because of underfunding. New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia are yet to fund redress schemes. The Victorian Government position is that individual <b>cases</b> <b>will</b> be addressed on their merits. The major problem for adult survivors of childhood abuse is the burden of proof of the abuse in a formal legal setting.|$|E
