2500|$|In their book, Albert Pinkham Ryder: Painter of Dreams, William Innes Homer and Lloyd Goodrich wrote, [...] "There {{are more}} fake Ryders {{than there are}} forgeries of any other American artist except his {{contemporary}} Ralph Blakelock."

They also claim (as of 1989) that some remain in private and museum collections {{in addition to being}} offered through art dealers and auction houses. Part of the reason why so many fake Ryders exist is that his style is easily copied.

Studies have revealed that these herbs induce anti-hepatic fibrosis and anti-hepatic apoptosis and alleviate hepatic oxidative stress. This study aims to determine {{the quality and quantity}} of an herbal formulation (Chinese name: Yin-Chen-Hao-Tang) using physical and <b>chemical</b> <b>examinations.</b> Physical examination of Yin-Chen-Hao-Tang in pharmaceutical herbal products, raw fiber powders, and decoction preparations was performed using Congo red and iodine-potassium staining. A sensitive and validated method employing ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was developed to simultaneously quantify the bioactive compounds scoparone, geniposide, and rhein in the Yin-Chen-Hao-Tang formulation in different preparations. Physical examination indicated that cellulose fibers with irregular round shapes were present in the pharmaceutical herbal products. The developed UHPLC-MS/MS method showed good linearity and was well validated. The quantification results revealed that the decoction preparations had the highest amounts of geniposide and rhein. Scoparone appeared in pharmaceutical herbal products from two manufacturers. This experiment provides a qualitative and quantitative method using physical and <b>chemical</b> <b>examinations</b> to test different preparations of herbal products.
