40|$|By {{introducing}} phase code into multicarrier orthogonal {{frequency division}} multiplex signal, the multicarrier phase coded (MCPC) radar signal possesses a good spectrum utilization rate and can achieve a good combination of narrowband and wideband processing. Radar pulse train signal not only reserves {{the high range}} resolution of monopulse signal, but also has the same velocity resolution performance as continuous wave signal does. In this study, we use the chaotic biphase code generated by Chebyshev mapping to conduct a phase modulation on MCPC pulse train so as to design {{two different types of}} multicarrier chaotic phase <b>coded</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>train</b> signal. The ambiguity functions of the two pulse train signals are compared with that of P 4 code MCPC pulse train. In addition, we analyze the influences of subcarrier number, phase-modulated bit number, and period number on the pulse train’s autocorrelation performance. The low probability of intercept (LPI) performance of the two signals is also discussed. Simulation results show that the designed pulse train signals have a thumbtack ambiguity function, a periodic autocorrelation side lobe lower than P 4 code MCPC pulse train, and excellent LPI performance, as well as the feature of waveform diversity...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the design of coded {{waveforms}} which optimize radar performances {{in the presence of}} colored Gaussian disturbance. We focus on the class of linearly <b>coded</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>trains</b> and determine the optimum radar code according to the following criterion: maximization of the detection performance under a control on the region of achievable Doppler estimation accuracies, and imposing a similarity constraint with a pre-fixed radar code. This last constraint is tantamount to requiring a similarity between the ambiguity functions of the devised waveform and of the <b>pulse</b> <b>train</b> encoded with the pre-fixed sequence. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex and quadratic. In order to solve it, we propose a technique (with polynomial computational complexity) based on the relaxation of the original problem into a semidefinite program. Thus the best code is determined through a rank-one decomposition of an optimal solution of the relaxed problem. At the analysis stage, we assess the performance of the new encoding technique in terms of detection performance, region of achievable Doppler estimation accuracies, and ambiguity function...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The work presented in this thesis {{is concerned with the}} design of discrete coded waveforms for improving range resolution and clutter performance of radar systems. This approach to signal design offers many advantages in terms of waveform shaping and digital implementation of processors. Assuming a matched filter receiver, the bulk of the work is concentrated on studying the autocorrelation function properties of these waveforms, which are directly related to the range resolution. The main objective is to synthesize <b>pulse</b> <b>trains</b> subject to a fixed amplitude constraint, whose autocorrelation sidelobes are as low as possible. Constant amplitude waveforms are attractive for a number of reasons; the principal one being the optimum utilization of transmitter power. <b>Pulse.</b> <b>train</b> signals can be synthesized directly by factorizing the spectrum of specified autocorrelation functions. The problems which arise if the autocorrelation function is only given in magnitude are considered and a design method is presented. For some applications, especially digital implementation, the design objective may be to approximate the response characteristics of a given analogue waveform. It is shown that virtually all the desired properties of analogue signals can be retained if the sampling interval is chosen properly. In addition various suggestions for reducing the range sidelobes of the autocorrelation function are discussed. An attempt is made to solve the signal design problem using numerical optimization methods that incorporate the fixed amplitude constraint. In particular, a constrained optimization technique is developed for synthesizing binary sequences with good autocorrelation function properties. Moreover, the problem of designing pairs of phase <b>coded</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>trains</b> with low autocorrelation sidelobes and small mutual crosscorrelation is considered. In the case of impulse-equivalent sequences known as Huffman codes, a synthesis method based on uniform <b>pulse</b> <b>trains</b> is shown to yield sequences with good energy efficiency. Furthermore, a new approach to the signal design problem using Huffman codes and parameter variational techniques is presented. Although the range sidelobes can be reduced quite effectively by numerical methods, for some applications they might still be too large. Thus optimum sidelobe reduction filters, which minimize the detection loss subject to a set of sidelobe constraints, are derived by mismatching the receiver filter. Finally, in the case where significant target velocity is encountered, it becomes necessary to consider not only the range but also the velocity resolution properties of the transmitted waveform. This is done for the various types of <b>pulse</b> <b>trains</b> using the standard range-doppler ambiguity description of Woodward...|$|R

We tested in awake guinea pigs the temporal acuity of auditory cortical neurons for gaps in cochlear implant <b>pulse</b> <b>trains.</b> Consistent with results using anesthetized conditions, temporal acuity improved with increasing pulse rates. Unlike the anesthetized condition, however, cortical neurons responded in the awake state to multiple distinct features of the gap-containing <b>pulse</b> <b>trains,</b> with the dominant features varying with stimulus pulse rate. Responses to {{the onset of the}} trailing <b>pulse</b> <b>train</b> (Trail-ON) provided the most sensitive gap detection at 1, 017 and 4, 069  pulse-per-second (pps) rates, particularly for short (25  ms) leading <b>pulse</b> <b>trains.</b> In contrast, under conditions of 254  pps rate and long (200  ms) leading <b>pulse</b> <b>trains,</b> a sizeable fraction of units demonstrated greater temporal acuity in the form of robust responses to the offsets of the leading <b>pulse</b> <b>train</b> (Lead-OFF). Finally, TONIC responses exhibited decrements in firing rate during gaps, but were rarely the most sensitive feature. Unlike results from anesthetized conditions, temporal acuity of the most sensitive units was nearly as sharp for brief as for long leading bursts. The differences in stimulus <b>coding</b> across <b>pulse</b> rates likely originate from pulse rate-dependent variations in adaptation in the auditory nerve. Two marked differences from responses to acoustic stimulation were: first, Trail-ON responses to 4, 069  pps trains encoded substantially shorter gaps than have been observed with acoustic stimuli; and second, the Lead-OFF gap coding seen for < 15  ms gaps in 254  pps stimuli is not seen in responses to sounds.
