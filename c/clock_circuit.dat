This type of circuit is contrasted with synchronous circuits, in which changes to the signal values in the circuit are triggered by repetitive pulses called a clock signal. Most digital devices today use synchronous circuits. However asynchronous circuits {{have the potential to}} be faster, and may also have advantages in lower power consumption, lower electromagnetic interference, and better modularity in large systems.

5000|$|Modern {{personal}} computer motherboards have a backup battery {{to run the}} real-time <b>clock</b> <b>circuit</b> and retain configuration memory while the system is turned off. This is often called the CMOS battery or BIOS battery. The original IBM AT through to the PS/2 range, used a relatively large primary lithium battery, compared to later models, to retain the clock and configuration memory. These early machines required the backup battery to be replaced periodically due to the relatively large power consumption. Some manufacturers of clone machines used a rechargeable battery to avoid the problems that could be created by a failing battery. Modern systems use a coin style primary battery. In these later machines, the current draw is almost negligible and the primary batteries usually outlast the system that they support. It is rare to find rechargeable batteries in such systems. Backup batteries are used in uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), and provide power to the computers they supply for a variable period after a power failure, usually long enough to at least allow the computer {{to be shut down}} gracefully. These batteries are often large [...] valve regulated lead-acid batteries in smaller or portable systems. Data center UPS backup batteries may be wet cell lead-acid or nickel cadmium batteries, with lithium ion cells available in some ratings.|$|E

Compared with the analog circuits, digital circuits show great advantages in power consumption. And algorithm of digital circuits is easy to implement.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundCircadian clocks are {{synchronized}} to {{the solar}} day via visual and specialized photoreceptors. In Drosophila, CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) {{is a major}} photoreceptor that mediates resetting of the circadian clock via light-dependent degradation of the clock protein TIMELESS (TIM). However, {{in the absence of}} CRY, this TIM-mediated resetting still occurs in some pacemaker neurons, resulting in synchronized behavioral rhythms when flies are exposed to light-dark cycles. Even in the additional absence of visual photoreception, partial molecular and behavioral light synchronization persists. Therefore, other important clock-related photoreceptive and synchronization mechanisms must exist. ResultsWe identified a novel clock-controlled gene (quasimodo) that encodes a light-responsive and membrane-anchored Zona Pellucida domain protein that supports light-dependent TIM degradation. Whereas wild-type flies become arrhythmic in constant light (LL), quasimodo mutants elicit rhythmic expression of clock proteins and behavior in LL. QUASIMODO (QSM) can function independently of CRY and is predominantly expressed within CRY-negative clock neurons. Interestingly, downregulation of qsm in the <b>clock</b> <b>circuit</b> restores LL clock protein rhythms in qsm-negative neurons, indicating that qsm-mediated light input is not entirely cell autonomous and can be accessed by the <b>clock</b> <b>circuit.</b> ConclusionsOur findings indicate that QSM constitutes part of a novel and CRY-independent light input to the circadian clock. Like CRY, this pathway targets the clock protein TIM. QSM's light-responsive character in conjunction with the predicted localization at the outer neuronal membrane suggests that its function is linked to a yet unidentified membrane-bound photoreceptor...|$|E

40|$|The {{transcriptional}} <b>circuits</b> of circadian <b>clocks</b> control {{physiological and}} behavioral rhythms. Light may affect such overt rhythms in two ways: (1) by entraining the <b>clock</b> <b>circuits</b> and (2) via clock-independent molecular pathways. In {{this study we}} {{examine the relationship between}} autonomous transcript oscillations and light-driven transcript responses. Transcript profiles of wild-type and arrhythmic mutant Drosophila were recorded both in the presence of an environmental photocycle and in constant darkness. Systematic autonomous oscillations in the 12 - to 48 -h period range were detectable only in wild-type flies and occurred preferentially at the circadian period length. However, an extensive program of light-driven expression was confirmed in arrhythmic mutant flies. Many light-responsive transcripts are preferentially expressed in the compound eyes and the phospholipase C component of phototransduction, NORPA (no receptor potential), is required for their light-dependent regulation. Although there is evidence for the existence of multiple molecular <b>clock</b> <b>circuits</b> in cyanobacteria, protists, plants, and fungi, Drosophila appears to possess only one such system. The sustained photic expression responses identified here are partially coupled to the circadian clock and may reflect a mechanism for flies to modulate functions such as visual sensitivity and synaptic transmission in response to seasonal changes in photoperiod...|$|R
