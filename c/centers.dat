5|$|Most {{important}} is the interaction of vacancies and interstitials with nitrogen. Carbon interstitials react with substitutional nitrogen producing a bond-centered nitrogen interstitial showing strong IR absorption at 1450 cm−1. Vacancies are efficiently trapped by the A, B and C nitrogen <b>centers.</b> The trapping rate is the highest for the C <b>centers,</b> 8 times lower for the A <b>centers</b> and 30 times lower for the B <b>centers.</b> The C center (single nitrogen) by trapping a vacancy forms the famous nitrogen-vacancy center, which can be neutral or negatively charged; the negatively charged state has potential applications in quantum computing. A and B <b>centers</b> upon trapping a vacancy create corresponding 2N-V (H3 and H2 <b>centers,</b> where H2 is simply a negatively charged H3 center) and the neutral 4N-2V (H4 center). The H2, H3 and H4 <b>centers</b> are important because they are present in many natural diamonds and their optical absorption can {{be strong enough to}} alter the diamond color (H3 or H4 – yellow, H2 – green).|$|E
