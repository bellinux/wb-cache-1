5000|$|The Municipal Fly <b>Casting</b> <b>Pool</b> at Recreation Park in East Long Beach is a 260-by-135-foot clear water, fishless pond {{built and}} {{operated}} since 1925 by the Long Beach Casting Club as {{only one of}} two Southern California city operated casting ponds (the other being in Pasadena). Described recently as a serene pond [...] "surrounded by a seemingly endless stretch of green grass {{against a backdrop of}} mountains and palm trees," [...] several movie stars from the 1940s were taught to fly cast at the pond, including Robert Taylor, Clark Gable, Jimmy Durante, and Barbara Stanwyck. In 1932, the fly fishing clubhouse adjacent to the fly fishing pond was used for the Summer Olympic Games and housed military personnel during World War II.|$|E
40|$|In {{determining}} which play to produce, {{there are numerous}} factors to consider: <b>casting</b> <b>pool,</b> audience draw, interest level for the director and production team, and relevancy to current issues in society. Upon deciding to direct Picnic, I was engaged by the wonderful roles for women and also transported to the seemingly simpler time of the early 1950 s. I realized that while Picnic may initially {{appear to be a}} “period piece”—taking place over fifty years ago—I further recognized that many issues in this play are as relevant today as they were fifty years ago. While Picnic is about passion, dreams, following your heart, and recognizing one’s own place in the world, all of these ideas can be wrapped up in the prominent thematic element of beauty versus intelligence—primarily from a woman’s perspective. Picnic is subtitled, “a summer romance, ” but beyond a classic romantic drama, it is a play that explores the expectations and perceptions of women in society. And interestingly enough, today’s women (and young girls) face many of the same identity struggles and issues of image and perception that Inge’s women did. On one hand, the 1950 s in this country really are a lifetime away from our current society. The 1950 s have often been portrayed with an idealized innocence, where the nuclea...|$|E

25|$|Closed {{shrinkage}} defects, {{also known}} as shrinkage porosity, are defects that form within the <b>casting.</b> Isolated <b>pools</b> of liquid form inside solidified metal, which are called hot spots. The shrinkage defect usually forms {{at the top of}} the hot spots. They require a nucleation point, so impurities and dissolved gas can induce closed shrinkage defects. The defects are broken up into macroporosity and microporosity (or microshrinkage), where macroporosity can be seen by the naked eye and microporosity cannot.|$|R
5000|$|In mid-1999 {{the team}} started {{developing}} a 3D engine from scratch. The engine used Direct3D {{to take advantage}} of hardware acceleration, but also had a software 3D engine for those computers without 3D cards. The team developed a [...] "Geoscape", a view of Earth from orbit, that far surpassed the implementation in previous versions. The original game had a flat-shaded, rather blocky representation of the Earth. Genesis had a smooth globe on a background of stars. With the mouse, the user could turn the Earth and when doing so, could see the Sun and Moon pass by in the background. A translucent covering of clouds swirled above the tranquil blue, green and brown planet surface below. The team built a level editor to allow the artists to build levels for the [...] "Battlescape" [...] - the areas where battles against the alien invaders would take place. The artists created an urban environment with a filling station, warehouse, an apartment building, attached parking garage, a park, a burning trashbin and streetlights that <b>cast</b> <b>pools</b> of light. Floating above it all was a blimp with floodlights streaming earthward. Standing in formation outside their aircraft were the X-COM soldiers, shifting on their feet, looking left to right. Zooming in closely, one could even see their chests huff as they breathed. By simply pointing and clicking, the soldiers could be commanded to move from place to place. All action was in real-time.|$|R
60|$|One morning I {{had gone}} off to fish by myself, with a Norwegian youth to gaff and carry the fish. Coming {{to a sort of}} weir, with a deep pool above and a riotous rapid below, I put on a salmon fly and <b>cast</b> into the <b>pool.</b> At once a fish rose and was hooked. It was not a big one--only 12 pounds or thereabouts--but quite big enough to break rod and line if not played respectfully.|$|R
50|$|When {{the hook}} was <b>cast</b> into the <b>pool,</b> R. Ranusentika felt {{the tip of}} the hook pulled by a fish that was big, but when the end of the hook is {{retrieved}} there was no big fish, but a pendok or yellow gold dagger sheath that caught the eye of the hook. Since then the waterfall is named after the waterfall Cipendok. Curug Cipendok restored and opened to the public since 1984. According to officials Cipendok waterfall tour manager, the interest of visitors is increasing every year.|$|R
60|$|In the evening, {{when the}} milking was finished, {{and all the}} things fed, then we went out to look at the snares. We wandered on across the stream and up the wild hillside. Our feet rattled through black patches of devil's-bit scabius; we skirted a swim of thistle-down, which glistened when the moon touched it. We {{stumbled}} on through wet, coarse grass, over soft mole-hills and black rabbit-holes. The hills and woods <b>cast</b> shadows; the <b>pools</b> of mist in the valleys gathered the moonbeams in cold, shivery light.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, the {{distribution}} of the flow field in the molten <b>pool</b> of the <b>casting</b> and rolling <b>pool</b> of different amplitudes or the equivalent frequency with different amplitude is studied through numerical simulation. Furthermore, the effects of solidification and low Reynolds turbulence models on the numerical simulations were considered [12 – 14]. In addition, the influence of the pressure change on the solidification process must be considered because {{the distribution}} of the flow field is affected by the oscillation of the roller during the strip casting process and the change of the pressure in the molten pool.|$|R

He {{also served as a}} member of parliament, i.e. député of the Haut-Rhin region from 1831 to 1837. He was elected on 5 July 1831 as member of the 5e collège du Haut-Rhin (Belfort), with 80 votes of a total of 156 votes <b>cast</b> from a <b>pool</b> of 171 registered voters against 68 for his competitor, Frédéric Japy.|$|R
5000|$|In 1814 Charles and {{his wife}} moved to Alton permanently. Work then began on turning the {{farmland}} around the house {{into one of the}} largest formal gardens in Britain. Several gardens were planted, including a Dutch garden and a rock garden. More than 13,000 trees were also planted in the landscaped parkland. The gardens in the valley leading down to the River Churnet hosted a variety of features. These included a Pagoda fountain which was fed by water from a spring at Ramshorn that passed through various lakes and <b>pools,</b> <b>cast</b> iron Garden Conservatories designed by Robert Abrahams, a [...] "Swiss Cottage" [...] that hosted a Welsh harpist and a copy of Lysicrates' Choragic Monument from Athens.|$|R
30|$|The {{oscillating}} {{strip casting}} process of one side casting roller is always rotating and oscillating, which causes the flow field change. Hence the transient algorithm {{was chosen for}} the simulation of the oscillating strip casting process [24] and the coupled algorithm for solving the pressure and velocity. The pressure interpolation {{was made by the}} Body Force Weighted, and the momentum, turbulent kinetic energy, turbulent kinetic energy dispersion rate and energy equations of the discrete schemed with second order upwind scheme. In the calculation process of the residual iterative convergence conditions are 1 × 10 ^ - 4, except 1 × 10 ^ - 6 for the energy equation. Meanwhile, the initial internal flow field does not completely flow due to the transient algorithm. Therefore, the molten pool flow field velocity variation in one oscillating cycle is not stable and the law of the real production in the oscillating strip <b>casting</b> molten <b>pool</b> flow, can’t be described. Consequently, it is necessary to monitor the velocity of some reference points that changes with time, in the molten pool, which stop the calculation until the reference velocity point size changes periodically with time.|$|R
5000|$|Playwright/performing artist Danny Hoch was {{originally}} <b>cast</b> as the <b>Pool</b> Guy in this episode. According to Hoch he objected {{to what he}} felt was ethnic stereotyping in the way his character was written: a stereotype of a [...] "crazy Hispanic named Ramon." [...] After Hoch unsuccessfully tried to have the character changed, he said that Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus were supportive of him, while Michael Richards {{told him he would}} be fired if he didn't play the role as written. Hoch then returned to his hotel room, and shortly afterwards received a phone call telling him he was being replaced and he should fly home as soon as possible. He told this story on a 2005 television documentary Race Is the Place and in his one-man show Jails, Hospitals & Hip Hop.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Twin- roll casting of {{magnesium}} alloys is a rapidly solidifying process, which can directly produce thin strips from molten metal. In this paper, {{based on a}} pilot vertical type twin-roll caster, 3 D models of twin-roll casting process were used for simulation of thermal flow and solidification on depending of <b>casting</b> speed, molten <b>pool</b> level and pouring temperature. The effect of side dams on thermal flow behavior was also considered. Based on the analyzed results, a proper concave slot nozzle was designed to compensate temperature variation across the width of strip. Comparing with parallel type slot nozzle, it can adjust temperature distribution along the roll width continuously by adopting proper concave curves, which is more flexible than rectification boards delivery system. Strips {{of magnesium}} alloy AZ 31 were produced in the pilot caster with the concave slot nozzle. The experiments show that surface quality of as cast strip was improved by using the new type of nozzle...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, I {{take the}} reader {{through the process}} and {{particular}} challenges of directing The House of Bernarda Alba, from choosing a translation, to <b>casting</b> from a <b>pool</b> of mostly undergraduate actors, to staging a show in-the-round. More particularly, I compare my previous work with adaptation to this process of treating the script as a fixed entity. I also offer a detailed explanation of the exploratory work I did with the actors in building the physicality of the play-world and exploring the relationships of the characters. For this, I drew heavily on Anne Bogart’s composition exercises, found in The Viewpoints Book. In this thesis, I transcribe and analyze some of the material generated through these exercises. Finally, I endeavor to prove that a certain freedom can be found through structure, and that the challenge of this production - which was assigned to me rather than a personal choice - helped me develop a more subtle creative voice than I had previously possessed...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{believed}} that the [...] "O" [...] in the [...] "SENTOSA" [...] plaster sculpture sign led to a dressing room concealed inside a narrow trench tucked in between the pond and main <b>pool.</b> <b>Cast</b> members of a show entered and exited through this opening. The [...] "O" [...] was also used during the performances of the 'Magical Sentosa' show. A projection room can also be clearly seen during the day, hidden {{on the left side}} of the cascading waterfall feature. The frontal part of the room is shrouded by greenery from the area, with some green scaffolding partially camouflaging it. Thus, rendering the only object in the room, the projector, visible from the seating gallery and platform. This may suggest that video and images are not projected from the front of the fountain but the back instead, to give it a clearer field of depth. The control room though is not located at that area, it is located at the front of the seating gallery. It is here that laser images and lighting are controlled and activated.|$|R

6000|$|Tweed, at this time, {{was full}} of trout, but even then they were not easy to catch. One {{difficulty}} lay {{in the nature of}} the wading. There is a pool near Ashiesteil and Gleddis Weil which illustrated this. Here Scott and Hogg were once upset from a boat while [...] "burning the water"--spearing salmon by torchlight. Herein, too, as Scott mentions in his Diary, he once caught two trout at one <b>cast.</b> The <b>pool</b> is long, is paved with small gravel, and allures you to wade on and on. But the water gradually deepens as you go forward, and the pool ends in a deep pot under each bank. Then to recover your ground becomes by no means easy, especially if the water is heavy. You get half-drowned, or drowned altogether, before you discover your danger. Many of the pools have this peculiarity, and in many, one step made rashly lets you into a very uncomfortable and perilous place. Therefore expeditions to Tweedside were apt to end in a ducking. It was often hard to reach the water where trout were rising, and the rise was always capricious. There might not be a stir on the water for hours, and suddenly it would be all boiling with heads and tails for twenty minutes, after which nothing was to be done. To miss [...] "the take" [...] was to waste the day, at least in fly-fishing. From a high wooded bank I have seen the trout feeding, and they have almost ceased to feed before I reached the waterside. Still worse was it to be allured into water over the tops of your waders, early in the day, and then to find that the rise was over, and there was nothing for it but a weary walk home, the basket laden only with damp boots. Still, the trout were undeniably there, and that was a great encouragement. They are there still, but infinitely more cunning than of old. Then, if they were feeding, they took the artificial fly freely; now it must be exactly of the right size and shade or they will have none of it. They come provokingly short, too; just plucking at the hook, and running out a foot of line or so, then taking their departure. For some reason the Tweed is more difficult to fish with the dry fly than--the Test, for example. The water is swifter and very dark, it drowns the fly soon, and on the surface the fly is less easily distinguished than at Whitchurch, in the pellucid streams. The Leader a tributary, may be fished with dry fly; on the Tweed one can hardly manage it. There is a plan by which rising trout may be taken--namely, by baiting with a small red worm and casting as in fly-fishing. But that is so hard on the worm! Probably he who can catch trout with fly on the Tweed between Melrose and Holy Lee can catch them anywhere. On a good day in April great baskets are still made in preserved parts of the Tweed, but, if they are made in open water, it must be, I fancy, with worm, or with the [...] "screw," [...] the lava of the May- fly. The screw is a hideous and venomous-looking animal, which is fixed on a particular kind of tackle, and cast up stream with a short line. The heaviest trout are fond of it, but it can only be used at a season when either school or Oxford keeps one far from what old Franck, Walton's contemporary, a Cromwellian trooper, calls [...] "the glittering and resolute streams of Tweed." ...|$|R
