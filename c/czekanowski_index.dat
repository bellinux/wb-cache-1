40|$|The {{prevalence}} of MRSA in the turkey meat production chain in Germany was estimated {{within the national}} monitoring for zoonotic agents in 2010. In total 22 / 112 (19. 6 %) dust samples from turkey farms, 235 / 359 (65. 5 %) swabs from turkey carcasses after slaughter and 147 / 460 (32. 0 %) turkey meat samples at retail were tested positive for MRSA. The specific distributions of spa types, SCCmec types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of MRSA isolated from these three different origins were compared using chi square statistics and the proportional similarity index (<b>Czekanowski</b> <b>index).</b> No significant differences between spa types, SCCmec types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of MRSA from different steps of the German turkey meat production chain were observed using Chi-Square test statistics. The <b>Czekanowski</b> <b>index</b> which can obtain values between 0 (no similarity) and 1 (perfect agreement) was consistently high (0. 79 – 0. 86) for the distribution of spa types and SCCmec types between the different processing stages indicating high degrees of similarity. The comparison of antimicrobial resistance profiles between the different process steps revealed the lowest <b>Czekanowski</b> <b>index</b> values (0. 42 – 0. 56). However, the <b>Czekanowski</b> <b>index</b> values were substantially higher than the index when isolates from the turkey meat production chain were compared to isolates from wild boar meat (0. 13 – 0. 19), {{an example of a}} separated population of MRSA used as control group. This result indicates that the proposed statistical method is valid to detect existing differences in the distribution of the tested characteristics of MRSA. The degree of similarity in the distribution of spa types, SCCme...|$|E

Compiled by Stefani J. Evers and Ann L. Shriver. International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade (IIFET), Corvallis, 2016. Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. Geographers and {{regional}} scientists have long recognized that "near things are more related than distant things. " Ports located far {{from each other}} may compete through use of the same fishing grounds. We describe trends in competition in the Northeast U. S Sea Scallop Fishery using a <b>Czekanowski</b> <b>Index</b> over the past 18 years and examine changes in intensity of ocean use, both within- and across-ports, using relative and absolute Theil indices of spatial disproportionality. During this time period, spatially delineated regulations have become increasingly important in the scallop fishery. The scallop fishery is currently managed {{with a combination of}} input controls (Days-at-Sea) and rotational closures; areas of the ocean with high concentrations of small scallops which remain closed until they grow larger. Notably, in 2001 - 2003 and 2008 - 2010 most of the rotational closures were in the north, while in 2006 most of the rotational closure areas were in the south. We find an increase in competition between Atlantic City, NJ and the other major ports in 2008 and 2009; we interpret this as a relocation of fishing activity to the Mid-Atlantic when the northern rotational areas were closed. The indicators provide a method of quantifying overlap in fishing activity {{that could be used to}} better understand implications of regulatory and environmental change in regional fishing economies. Finally, taking cues from the political science literature, we explore the suitability of the <b>Czekanowski</b> <b>index</b> as a measure of nearness in the context of spatial analysis and spatial econometrics...|$|E
40|$|By using 50 unabsorbed antisera, we {{were able}} to {{serotype}} 272 (65. 7 %) of 414 thermotolerant campylobacters from wild and domestic animals, on the basis of heat-stable antigens identified by means of passive hemagglutination. Forty-two serotypes were recognized. The pattern of serotypes detected in the various animal species was compared to human clinical isolates by using the <b>Czekanowski</b> <b>index</b> (proportional similarity index). The highest degree of similarity to the clinical isolates was observed for the poultry isolates, followed by strains from wild birds, flies, and pigs (in order of decreasing similarity). The serotypes recovered most frequently from poultry (LAU 1 and LAU 2) were also most prevalent in Norwegian patients. In contrast, serotype LAU 35 / 44, the predominant porcine serotype, was never recovered from human clinical specimens. Flies captured in chicken farms and in piggeries harbored serotypes which were also commonly seen in chickens and pigs, respectively. Nine of the strains included in this study could not be ascribed to any defined species. All of these were resistant to nalidixic acid and did not produce H 2 S...|$|E
40|$|The Capetinga {{gallery forest}} {{is located at}} Agua Limpa Farm, in the Federal District, Brazil. The floristic compositionand {{structure}} of the natural regeneration at the edges and {{in the interior of}} the gallery forest at the watershed of the Capetinga stream was studied to detect floristic and structural patterns related to the forest environments. Thirty (5 x 5 m) plots were placed in each environment to sample saplings, individuals from 1, 0 m high with diameter at the steam base under 5, 0 cm. Within these plots, (2 x 2 m) sub-plots were allocated to sample seedlings, individuals lower than 1, 0 m height. The sampled plots were distant to the stream bank to minimize the humidity effect. Shannon & Wiener diversity index varied from 2, 86 (seedlings at the edges) to 3, 51 (saplings at the interior) and it was higher in the interior for both categories. Sørensen s similarity index varied from 0. 474 for seedlings (comparingedges with interior) to 0. 735 (seedlings and saplings at the edges). <b>Czekanowski</b> <b>indices</b> were low and reflected the high differentiationin structure from plot to plot in the same gallery forest. TWINSPAN classification suggested two distinct communities for saplings forboth conditions, formed by species accordingly to their requirements for light and water. No differentiation was detected for seedlingsbetween the environments indicating a low response of plants at an early stage to the environmental conditions within the forest. TheCapetinga gallery forest suffered disturbances by fire and the small variations in species composition and vegetation structurebetween environments suggests that most of the natural regeneration is tolerant to light...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 10 The {{trophic ecology}} of Octopus vulgaris paralarvae {{collected}} in 2008 off the Ría de Vigo, NW Spain 11 (42 º 12. 80 ‟N– 9 º 00. 00 ‟W) {{was approached by}} both morphological and molecular methods. External 12 digestion of prey and posterior suction of the liquefied contents by wild O. vulgaris paralarvae made the 13 morphological identification of gut contents impossible. Thus, a PCR-based method using group specific 14 primers was selected to identify prey consumed by O. vulgaris paralarvae in the pelagic realm. The 15 mitochondrial ribosomal 16 S gene region was chosen for designing group specific primers, which 16 targeted {{a broad range of}} crustaceans and fishes but avoided the amplification of predator DNA. These 17 primers successfully amplified DNA of prey by using a semi-nested PCR-based approach and posterior 18 cloning. Homology search and phylogenetic analysis were then conducted with the 20 different 19 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) obtained to identify the putative organisms ingested. The 20 phylogenetic analysis clustered ingested prey into 12 families of crustaceans (11 belonging to the order 21 Decapoda and 1 to the order Euphausiacea) and two families of fishes (Gobiidae and Carangidae). 22 According to the <b>Czekanowski's</b> <b>Index</b> (CI), the trophic niche breadth of O. vulgaris paralarvae is low 23 (CI= 0. 13), which means that these paralarvae are specialist predators at least during the first weeks of 24 their life cycle. It {{is the first time that}} natural prey has been identified in O. vulgaris paralarvae collected 25 from the wild and such knowledge may be critical to increasing the survival of O. vulgaris hatchlings in 26 captivity, a goal that has been actively pursued since the 1960 ‟s by aquaculture researchers. 2...|$|R
40|$|The diet of long-beaked {{common dolphin}} Delphinus capensis, dusky dolphin Lagenorhynchus obscurus, Burmeister’s {{porpoise}} Phocoena spinipinnis, and bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus, was determined based on 281 stomach contents collected along the Peruvian central coast and San Juan de Marcona {{in the period}} 1987 - 1993. Counts of otoliths, squid beaks and some other remains were used to estimate frequency of occurrence and prey percentage of composition (PC). Long-beaked common dolphins (n= 117) fed mainly on fish (98. 71 % of preys), the remainder was composed of squids and crustaceans: Peruvian anchovies Engraulis ringens (PC= 71. 14 %), Vincigerria lucetia (7. 89 %), Lampanictus parvicauda (6. 77 %), Merluccius gayi (4. 49 %), Odontesthes regia (3. 54 %), Mictophum nitidulum (2. 62 %) and Trachurus picturatus (1. 42 %). Dusky dolphins (n= 66) consumed E. ringens (49. 8 %, 16. 9 %), L. parvicauda (23. 6 %, 0. 1 %), T. picturatus (17. 1 %, 0 %), Normachthys crockery (0 %, 76. 4 %), V. lucetia (3. 5 %, 0. 1 %), and Sardinops sagax (2. 8 %, 0 %) off the central Peruvian coast and San Juan de Marcona, respectively. In the same areas, Burmeister’s porpoise (n= 67) fed on anchovies (90. 37 %, 81. 89 %), O. regia (6. 64 %, 0 %), Anchoa sp. (1. 13 %, 0 %), N. crockery (0 %, 8. 53 %) and M. gayi (0. 65 %, 8. 4 %). Bottlenose dolphins (n= 22) consumed L. parvicauda (39. 24 %), Sphiraena sp. (13. 48 %), S. sagax (13. 31 %), Prionotus sp. (9. 59 %), M. gayi (7. 43 %), T. picturatus (4. 41 %) and E. ringens (4. 06 %). The use of the Shannon & Wiener, Levins and <b>Czekanowski’s</b> <b>indexes</b> {{in combination with the}} feeding patterns of the sampled species indicated an opportunistic feeding strategy with respect to their preys. The four cetacean species studied are predators of both pelagic and mesopelagic large schooling fish species, and demonstrate no selectivity towards prey species but towards social behaviour and habitat. An average linkage cluster analysis showed high levels of similarity in the diets of the studied cetaceans. This low diversification and a high degree of overlap in trophic niches is probably related to the high productivity of the Peruvian upwelling ecosystem...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the floristic {{composition of the}} tree-shrub vegetation in 10 areas of rocky outcrop cerrado in Goiás State, Brazil. Ten 20 × 50 m plots (totaling 1 ha) were established {{and all of the}} individuals with diameters at 30 cm above soil level (DB 30) ≥ 5 cm were included in the sampling. Comparative analyses of the flora were realized using similarity indices (Sørensen and Czekanowski), classification analysis (TWINSPAN), and the Mantel test. A total of 13, 041 tree-shrub individuals were sampled, distributed among 219 species, 129 genera and 55 families. Fabaceae was the most well-represented family, followed by Myrtaceae, Melastomataceae, Vochysiaceae, Malphigiaceae, and Rubiaceae. Fully 42. 3 % of the comparisons evaluated by the Sørensen index were > 0. 50, while all the values were < 0. 50 for the <b>Czekanowski</b> <b>index,</b> with the exception of Jaraguá and Mara Rosa areas. The TWINSPAN classification generated four divisions and, in general, only the differences {{in the size of the}} population were responsible for the groupings. The Mantel test indicated that there was no relationship between floristic similarity and the distances between the areas (r = 0. 32, P = 0. 05). It therefore appears that the areas of rocky outcrop cerrado in Goiás State are relatively floristically homogeneous and that they are principally distinguished by the differences in the sizes of the populations of their dominant species, and the presence of exclusive species in certain areas...|$|E
40|$|This work {{aimed at}} {{identifying}} and quantifying colonizer species and structure in gravel mining degraded environment {{and to identify}} species for restoration. It was selected three sites characterized as: site 1 (S 1), place with less intense history of use; site 2 (S 2), intermediary level of degradation; and site 3 (S 3), with higher degradation. Within the three sites it was withdrawn 20 plots of 25 m². Within each plot, species with height ≥ 0. 10 m and DNS ≤ 5. 0 cm were sampled. It was calculated Shannon’s diversity (H’), Pielou’s equability (J’), Jaccard’s and <b>Czekanowski’s</b> similarity <b>indices,</b> {{as well as the}} phytosociology parameters, besides the analysis of indicator species. Thirty-two species and 15 families were registered. S 1 was the most species-rich, with the highest density, while S 2 presented the lowest richness and density. The sites showed low floristic and structural similarity and statistical differences regarding density, (it was found 844, 270 and 497 individuals in, sites A 1, A 2 and A 3, respectively). Diversity varied from 1, 680 to 2, 074 nats. individual - 1. Probably, these divergences are due to the environment variations imposed by the different degradation intensities. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} {{contribution of}} vertebrate-mediated seed rain {{to the maintenance}} of plant community richness in a High Arctic ecosystem was investigated. We analysed viable seed content in dung of the four numerically most important terrestrial vertebrates in Northeast Greenland, viz. muskox (Ovibos moschatus), barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis), arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) and arctic hare (Lepus arcticus). High numbers of plant propagules were found in the dung of muskox and barnacle goose. Seeds of many plant species were found in the faeces of one vertebrate species only. Propagule composition in barnacle goose droppings was relatively uniform over samples, with high abundance of the nutritious bulbils of Polygonum viviparum (Bistorta vivipara), suggesting that geese have narrow habitat preference and feed selectively. Propagule composition in muskox dung was diverse and heterogeneous among samples, suggesting generalist food selection and haphazard ingestion of plant propagules with foliage. Species composition of plant propagules in dung samples was different from species composition of the receiving plant communities (in terms of Sørensen and <b>Czekanowski</b> dissimilarity <b>indices)</b> and dung deposition, especially by muskox, often brought new species to the receiving community. The results suggest that endozoochorous propagule dispersal in the Arctic has a great potential in the generation and maintenance of local species richness, albeit being little specialized. It is further suggested that endozoochory is an important means of long-distance dispersal, and hence plant migration in response to climate change...|$|R
40|$|The Rákos-stream is a {{small stream}} near Budapest (Hungary). The water of the stream is {{considerably}} polluted with communal and industrial wastewaters. In May and September 2001 benthic diatom samples were collected along the stream, in May {{from the surface of}} available water plants and gravel. In September samples {{from the side of the}} concrete bed of the stream were also gathered. Diatoms were identified and their relative abundances were determined in each sample. The diatom indices SLA, L&M, IBD, IPS, EPI-D and CEE were calculated using the software,,Omnidia", which has been developed in France for the purpose of water quality analysis with benthic diatoms. The Shannon-Weaver diversity values were calculated for each association and the data were clustered by <b>Czekanowski</b> and Jaccard <b>indices.</b> The aim of the study was to draw some conclusions on the water quality and to give a floristical overview of benthic diatom flora, since algological observations were previously not made on this stream. The quality of the water based on benthic diatoms is good near the source of the stream, moderate near the mouth and polluted on the middle reach. The diversity values increase from the source towards the mouth. The cluster dendrograms showed that the similarity of benthic diatom associations is firstly influenced by the sampling point, and then by the seasonality. The sampled substratum has less influence. Some very interesting species for Hungary were found. The planktic centric species Thalassiosira duostra was observed in our samples, in greater individual numbers on the most polluted reaches of the stream. Cyclotella distinguenda was noticed at several points (this is the first occurrence of this species in Hungary). Diadesmis confervacea was identified in some samples (it is the third occurrence of this species in Hungary). This species is supposed to be an invasive diatom, which has until recently been considered as a mainly tropical taxon. Finally, Navicula microrhombus was found in fairly great relative abundance at several points in the Rákos-stream (this is also the first occurrence of this species in Hungary) ...|$|R
