25|$|The {{transport}} layer establishes basic data channels that applications use for task-specific data exchange. The layer establishes process-to-process connectivity, meaning it provides end-to-end {{services that are}} independent {{of the structure of}} user data and the logistics of exchanging information for any particular specific purpose. Its responsibility includes end-to-end message transfer independent of the underlying network, along with error control, segmentation, flow control, congestion control, and application addressing (port numbers). End-to-end message transmission or connecting applications at the {{transport layer}} can be categorized as either connection-oriented, implemented in TCP, or <b>connectionless,</b> implemented in UDP.|$|E
25|$|This {{abstraction}} {{also allows}} upper layers {{to provide services}} that the lower layers do not provide. While the original OSI model was extended to include <b>connectionless</b> services (OSIRM CL), IP is not designed to be reliable and is a best effort delivery protocol. This means that all transport layer implementations must choose whether or how to provide reliability. UDP provides data integrity via a checksum but does not guarantee delivery; TCP provides both data integrity and delivery guarantee by retransmitting until the receiver acknowledges the reception of the packet.|$|E
25|$|UDP {{scanning}} is also possible, {{although there}} are technical challenges. UDP is a <b>connectionless</b> protocol {{so there is no}} equivalent to a TCP SYN packet. However, if a UDP packet is sent to a port that is not open, the system will respond with an ICMP port unreachable message. Most UDP port scanners use this scanning method, and use the absence of a response to infer that a port is open. However, if a port is blocked by a firewall, this method will falsely report that the port is open. If the port unreachable message is blocked, all ports will appear open. This method is also affected by ICMP rate limiting.|$|E
500|$|Internet {{reporter}} Dana Blankenhorn {{stated that}} the size of the bill illustrated a problem with the telephone companies' [...] "event based" [...] or connection-oriented business model and used it to argue for open spectrum in a radio frequency spectrum auction in the U.S. scheduled for 2008. He contrasted how telephone billing considers every action a separately billable event, while the Internet model is based on a flat fee for best-effort delivery in <b>connectionless</b> mode transmission.|$|E
2500|$|The User Datagram Protocol is a <b>connectionless</b> {{datagram}} protocol. Like IP, it is a best effort, [...] "unreliable" [...] protocol. Reliability {{is addressed}} through error detection using a weak checksum algorithm. UDP is typically used for {{applications such as}} streaming media (audio, video, Voice over IP etc.) where on-time arrival {{is more important than}} reliability, or for simple query/response applications like DNS lookups, where the overhead of setting up a reliable connection is disproportionately large. Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a datagram protocol that is designed for real-time data such as streaming audio and video.|$|E
2500|$|Louis Pouzin (born 1931) is a French {{computer}} scientist. He {{invented the}} datagram and designed an early packet communications network, CYCLADES.

In 1997, Pouzin received the ACM SIGCOMM Award for [...] "pioneering work on <b>connectionless</b> packet communication". Louis Pouzin was named a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor by the French government on March 19, 2003. In 2012, Pouzin was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame by the Internet Society.|$|E

50|$|The {{transport}} layer transfers data between source and destination processes. Generally, two connection modes are recognized, connection-oriented or <b>connectionless.</b> Connection-oriented service establishes a dedicated virtual circuit and offers various grades of guaranteed delivery, ensuring that data received {{is identical to}} data transmitted. <b>Connectionless</b> mode provides only best-effort service without the built-in ability to correct errors, which includes complete loss of data without notifying the data source of the failure. No logical connection, and no persistent state of the transaction exists between the endpoints, lending the <b>connectionless</b> mode low overhead and potentially better real-time performance for timing-critical applications such as voice and video transmissions.|$|E
