5|$|For vertebrates, {{the early}} stages of neural {{development}} are similar across all species. As the embryo transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure, a narrow strip of ectoderm running along the midline of the back is induced to become the neural plate, the precursor of the nervous system. The neural plate folds inward to form the neural groove, and then the lips that line the groove merge to enclose the neural tube, a hollow cord of cells with a fluid-filled ventricle at the center. At the front end, the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. At the next stage, the forebrain splits into two vesicles called the telencephalon (which will <b>contain</b> <b>the</b> cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures) and the diencephalon (which will <b>contain</b> <b>the</b> thalamus and hypothalamus). At about the same time, the hindbrain splits into the metencephalon (which will <b>contain</b> <b>the</b> cerebellum and pons) and the myelencephalon (which will <b>contain</b> <b>the</b> medulla oblongata). Each of these areas contains proliferative zones where neurons and glial cells are generated; the resulting cells then migrate, sometimes for long distances, to their final positions.|$|E
