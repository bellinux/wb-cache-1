40|$|The 2 -D {{resistive}} sensor array in the row–column fashion {{suffered from the}} crosstalk problem for parasitic parallel paths. Firstly, we proposed an Improved Isolated Drive Feedback Circuit with Compensation (IIDFCC) based on the voltage feedback method to suppress the crosstalk. In this method, a <b>compensated</b> <b>resistor</b> was specially used to reduce the crosstalk caused by the column multiplexer resistors and the adjacent row elements. Then, a mathematical equivalent resistance expression of the element being tested (EBT) of this circuit was analytically derived and verified by the circuit simulations. The simulation {{results show that the}} measurement method can greatly reduce the influence on the EBT caused by parasitic parallel paths for the multiplexers’ channel resistor and the adjacent elements...|$|R
40|$|During the {{construction}} of self-propelled and tractor-pulled farm machines several tests take place in laboratory and in the field. The functional and the stress-strain tests are mostly used. The mechanical load on the chassis {{is derived from the}} load of the normal machine operation and from the mechanical motion on the terrain. The normal machine operation is a specific problem and depends on the operation of the specific machine. This article deals with the strain measurement on the critical parts of chassis and the accelerations on the machine during motion. The mobile measuring system consists of 3 pieces of HBM made Spider 8 universal digital PC measurement electronics with 4. 8 kHz carrier frequency all in all 24 measuring channels and a notebook. The measuring channels can process strain gages with ¼ bridge configuration together with external <b>compensating</b> <b>resistors</b> and inductive half bridge acceleration transducers. The purpose of the article is to give an example of a complete mobile measuring system and a couple of problems during the calibration and the interpretation of measuring data...|$|R
40|$|A {{high-temperature}} instrumentation amplifier {{that uses}} dynamic feedback is presented. It realizes dynamic feedback {{by means of}} a rotating chain of <b>resistors</b> to <b>compensate</b> for <b>resistor</b> mismatches. An 11 x dynamic-feedback instrumentation amplifier has been integrated in a standard junction-isolated 1. 6 -μm CMOS process and realizes an average gain error below 25 ppm up to 250 °C without calibration or trimming. Leakage currents cause additional gain errors at higher temperatures. Nevertheless, even at 300 °C, this average gain error is still less than 500 ppm...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{behaviour}} of the (I-V) characteristics is {{investigated in}} n+-i-n+ highly <b>compensated</b> Si <b>resistors</b> at temperatures 4. 2 - 45 K. The conduction mechanisms {{are discussed in}} detail here. The prebreakdown and breakdown regions of I-V characteristics were simulated by a one-dimensional model including the evidence of impurity high compensation and freeze out effects {{as well as the}} shallow-dopants impact ionisation by the injected hot carriers into the base. Negative resistance (S-type) phenomena are also observed on the characteristics for high injection current densities. I...|$|R
40|$|Charge {{transport}} {{phenomena in}} n(+) -i-n(+) highly <b>compensated</b> Si <b>resistors</b> {{have been investigated}} in the temperature range 4. 2 - 300 K from measurements of the I-V static characteristics. The prebreakdown and breakdown regions of I-V characteristics, observed at liquid-helium temperatures, were simulated by a one-dimensional model including the high compensation effect {{as well as the}} impact ionization of the frozen-out shallow dopants by the hot electrons injected into the base. An impurity hopping conduction mechanism is considered for the prebreakdown regime at temperatures between 4. 2 and 20 K. Negative differential resistance (S-type) phenomena are also observed on the I-V characteristics for high injection current densities and are discussed in terms of the inhomogeneous distribution of the electric field into the base at liquid-helium temperatures...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the proposal, {{implementation}} and evaluation of test for fault condition indicators. Thesis focusing on earth fault indicators based on admittance principles. These indicators {{must be able to}} evaluate earth faults in compensated, <b>compensated</b> with auxiliary <b>resistor,</b> unearthed and high-resistance earthed networks. The proposed tests verify the current and voltage measurement errors in inputs including monitored characteristic variables such as conductance and susceptance. The proposed test are applied to a selected ample of the fault indicator. As part of the tests, the indicator is subjected to secondary test using the Omicron CMC 256 plus tester as well as test on fault records that have been converted to COMTRADE for this purpose. The last series of tests carried out uses the physical model of the medium voltage system, where the tested equipment is subjected to fault states in the <b>compensated</b> whit auxiliary <b>resistor</b> system and isolated system. Furthermore, part of the thesis is research of new methods of earth fault detection, including their principles and function description. Also included in the thesis is an overview of manufacturers of indicators, or protection, who are involved in the production of earth fault protection...|$|R
40|$|The {{opposite}} {{signs of}} the {{temperature coefficient of resistance}} (TCR) of two thin film materials, titanium nitride (TiN) and tantalum nitride (TaN), were used to form temperature <b>compensated</b> thin film <b>resistors</b> (TFRs). The principle of designing temperature compensated TFRs by connecting TFRs of each compound in series or in parallel was demonstrated. TiN, TaN, and combined TiN and TaN TFRs for monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) were fabricated by reactive sputtering. DC characterization was performed over the temperature range of 30 - 200 degrees C. The TiN TFRs exhibited an increase in resistivity with temperature with TCRs of 540 and 750 ppm/degrees C. The TaN TFR on the other hand exhibited a negative TCR of - 470 ppm/degrees C. The shunted TFRs were fabricated by serial deposition of TiN and TaN to form a bilayer component. The TCRs of the series- and shunt configurations were experimentally reduced to - 60 and 100 ppm/degrees C, respectively. The concept of temperature compensation was used to build a Wheatstone bridge with an application in on-chip temperature sensing...|$|R
