50|$|Ewald asserts, {{along with}} {{a growing body of}} peer {{reviewed}} studies published in mainstream scientific journals, that many common diseases of unknown origin are in fact the result of chronic low-level infections from viruses, bacteria or protozoa. For example, cervical <b>cancer</b> can <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by the human papilloma virus, some cases of liver <b>cancer</b> <b>are</b> <b>caused</b> by hepatitis C or B and the bacteria Helicobacter pylori has <b>been</b> proven to <b>cause</b> stomach ulcers. Ewald argues that many common diseases of currently unknown etiology, such as cancers, heart attacks, stroke and Alzheimer's, may likewise <b>be</b> also <b>caused</b> by chronic low-level microbial infection.|$|R
50|$|In general, <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by {{damage to}} DNA {{that leads to}} {{uncontrolled}} cellular growth and spreads throughout the body, either by increasing chemical signals that cause growth or by interrupting chemical signals that control growth. Damage can be caused through the formation of fusion genes, {{as well as the}} dysregulation of a proto-oncogene via juxtaposition of it to the promoter of another gene, e.g. the T-cell receptor gene. This damage may be caused by environmental factors such as chemicals, drugs or radiation, and occurs naturally during mitosis or other normal processes (although cells have numerous mechanisms of DNA repair that help to reduce this).|$|E
50|$|In 1979, J. Michael Bishop and Harold E. Varmus {{discovered}} that normal chickens contain {{a gene that}} is structurally closely related to v-Src. The normal cellular gene was called c-src (cellular-src). This discovery changed the current thinking about cancer from a model wherein <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by a foreign substance (a viral gene) to one where a gene that is normally present in the cell can cause cancer. It is believed {{that at one point}} an ancestral virus mistakenly incorporated the c-Src gene of its cellular host. Eventually this normal gene mutated into an abnormally functioning oncogene within the Rous sarcoma virus. Once the oncogene is transfected back into a chicken, it can lead to cancer.|$|E
5000|$|Gonzalez's {{treatment}} methods, which he's {{been using}} since 1987, are developed from previous {{work by the}} orthodontist William Donald Kelley. Gonzalez believes that <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by poor diet, a problem compounded when one does not eat a diet that corresponds with one's metabolic type; environmental pollution and daily stress contribute to health problems. The Gonzalez regimen proposes as a treatment a cure-oriented change in life style and nutrition, the use of oral pancreatic enzymes, large numbers of dietary supplements (up to 150 pills per day) and twice daily coffee enemas. According to the National Cancer Institute, which co-sponsored with the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine a clinical trial on Gonzalez's treatments produced [...] "limited and inconclusive" [...] results regarding {{the efficacy of the}} Gonzalez Regimen as a treatment for cancer.|$|E

5000|$|In 2006, NCCIH {{was criticized}} in Science with the comment [...] "NCCAM funds {{proposals}} of dubious merit; its research agenda is shaped more by politics than by science; {{and it is}} structured by its charter {{in a manner that}} precludes an independent review of its performance." [...] The authors suggested that, while it was appropriate to study alternative therapies, the quality of its research was lower than other NIH institutes, and that these studies could be performed under the auspices of other institutes within the NIH. As an example, they authors described a trial of gemcitabine with the Gonzalez regimen for stage II to IV pancreatic cancer, in the belief that <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by a deficiency of pancreatic proteolytic enzymes. Severe adverse effects were associated with the Gonzalez regimen, and no evidence in peer-reviewed journals supported the plausibility or efficacy of the regimen or chelation therapy.|$|E
50|$|Cervical <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> {{by human}} {{papilloma}} virus (HPV) expressing E6 and E7 oncoproteins, which inactivate the tumor suppressor protein p53 and pRb respectively. Withaferin A {{was found to}} down regulate expression of E6 and E7 oncoproteins, induce accumulation of p53, causes G2/M cell cycle arrest, alters the expression levels of apoptotic markers Bcl2, Bax and caspase3. In athymic mice model, withaferin reduced 70% of the tumor volume. Therefore, withaferin A can be a potential therapeutic agent {{for the treatment of}} cervical cancer without major side effects. Withaferin A has been shown to enhance radiation-induced apoptosis in certain cell lines. However, its mechanism of action on cell death is not well understood. It has been suggested that sensitization of cancer cells to radiation is due to the inhibition of NF-κB. It exhibits anti-tumor as well as anti-inflammatory activities. It can act as an immuno-suppressant by inhibiting NF-κB activation. In animal models, it prevented skin cancer induced by ultraviolet radiation. The antioxidant property of withaferin aid in the prevention of DNA damage by mutagens; in combination with detoxifying, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, it can contribute to the chemopreventive action.|$|E
