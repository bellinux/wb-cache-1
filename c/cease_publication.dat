5|$|After {{both the}} British Industrial Syndicalist Education League (ISEL), a {{short-lived}} syndicalist organization {{heavily involved in}} the strike wave in Britain from 1910, and the Dutch syndicalist union National Labor Secretariat (NAS) published proposals for an international syndicalist congress in 1913, the FVdG {{was the first to}} express support. There were difficulties in organizing the congress, and the largest syndicalist union worldwide— the CGT— refused to participate because it was already affiliated with the social democratic International Federation of Trade Unions. Despite these challenges, the First International Syndicalist Congress took place at Holborn Town Hall in London from September 27 to October 2. British, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Belgian, French, Spanish, Italian, Cuban, Brazilian, and Argentine organizations—both labor unions and political groups— had delegates in London in addition to the FVdG, which was represented by Karl Roche, Carl Windhoff, and Fritz Kater. There were also links with Norwegian, Polish, and American groups. Kater was elected co-president of the congress alongside Jack Wills. After Wills was forced to resign, Kater served as co-president with Jack Tanner. The congress had difficulty agreeing on many issues, the main source of conflict being whether further schisms in the European labor movement (as had occurred in Germany and the Netherlands) should be risked. The FVdG generally agreed with their Dutch comrades in calling on other unions to decide between syndicalism and socialism, while their Italian, French, and Spanish counterparts, most notably Alceste De Ambris of the Italian USI, were more intent on preventing further division. Accordingly, the congress was divided {{on the question of whether}} its purpose was to simply pave the way for deeper relations between the syndicalist unions or whether a Syndicalist International was to be founded. The opponents of a new organization prevailed, but the congress agreed to establish an Information Bureau. The Information Bureau was based in Amsterdam and published the Bulletin international du mouvement syndicaliste. The congress was considered a success by most who attended, with the notable exception of De Ambris. A second congress was scheduled to take place in two years' time in Amsterdam. Due to the outbreak of World War I, the congress did not take place. The Bulletin only published for eighteen issues before the war caused it to <b>cease</b> <b>publication.</b>|$|E
25|$|In May 2008, both Shueisha and Studio APPP halted manga/OVA {{shipments}} of JoJo after a complaint had been launched against them {{by a group}} of online Muslim protestors after a scene from one of the OVA's episodes features Dio reading a book depicting pages from the Qur'an. This recall affected the English-language releases as well, causing Viz Media and Shueisha to <b>cease</b> <b>publication</b> for a year. Even though the manga did not feature that specific scene, Shueisha had Araki redraw scenes that depicted characters fighting on-top, and destroying, mosques. Viz resumed publication a year later, with the eleventh volume being published on April 7, 2009, and thus their publication was continued.|$|E

25|$|O'Brien, {{alarmed at}} the {{increased}} activity of Sinn Féin in 1915, predicted {{the danger of}} a potential republican eruption, culminating in the IRB 1916 Rebellion, in which however Sinn Féin were not involved. He was forced to <b>cease</b> <b>publication</b> of his Cork Free Press in 1916 soon after the appointment of Lord Decies as Chief Press Censor for Ireland. Decies warned the press {{to be careful about}} what they published. Such warnings had little effect when dealing with such papers as the Cork Free Press. It was suppressed after its republican editor, Frank Gallagher, accused the British authorities of lying about the conditions and situation of republican prisoners in the Frongoch internment camp.|$|E
25|$|During the {{invasion}} of Poland by Nazi Germany in September 1939 he participated {{in the defense of}} Warsaw. Together with the leader of the Bund, Szmul Zygielbojm, and with support from Warsaw's mayor Stefan Starzyński, he helped to organize all-Jewish detachments that defended the Polish capital against the German assault. Along with other Bund activists Blum continued to edit the party's newspaper, the Folkszajtung ("the People's Gazette") ensuring that it did not <b>cease</b> <b>publication</b> during the siege. As the occupation of Warsaw commenced most of the Bund's senior leadership was forced to evacuate the city, as they may have been too well known to the Germans, and the local leadership of the party was taken over by younger members, many of them from the Cukunft. Blum, who was their leader, has been credited with ensuring the Warsaw Bob's survival during this difficult time.|$|E
25|$|Before John Reed {{left for}} Russia, the Espionage Act was passed on June 15, 1917, which fined and imprisoned anyone who {{interfered}} with the recruiting of soldiers and prohibited the mailing of any newspaper or magazine that promoted such sentiments. The U. S. Postal Service was also given leave to deny any mailing that fitted these standards from further postal delivery, and then to disqualify a magazine because it had missed a mailing and hence, was no longer considered a regular publication. Because of this, The Masses was forced by the United States federal government to <b>cease</b> <b>publication</b> {{in the fall of}} 1917, after refusing to change the magazine's policy against the war. The Liberator, founded by Max Eastman under his and his sister's private control, published Reed's articles concerning the Russian Revolution instead. In an effort to ensure the magazine's survival, Eastman compromised and tempered its views accordingly.|$|E

25|$|Although it {{received}} some funds from Jews in New York, the journal's financial survival was precarious from the start. However, many volunteers helped by selling {{the paper on}} street corners and in workshops. During this time, Rocker was especially concerned with combating the influence of Marxism and historical materialism in London's Jewish labor movement. In all, the Arbeter Fraint published twenty-five essays by Rocker on the topic, the first ever critical examination of Marxism in Yiddish, according to William J. Fishman. Arbeter Fraints unsound financial footing also meant Rocker rarely received the small salary promised {{to him when he}} took over the journal and he depended financially on Witkop. Despite Rocker's sacrifices, however, the paper was forced to <b>cease</b> <b>publication</b> for lack of funds. In November 1899, the prominent American anarchist Emma Goldman visited London and Rocker met her for the first time. After hearing of the Arbeter Fraints situation she held three lectures to raise funds, but that was not enough.|$|E
25|$|More than 200 {{newspapers}} and 350 consumer magazines have {{an office in}} the city, and the publishing industry employs about 25,000 people. Two of the three national daily newspapers in the United States are New York papers: The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, which has won the most Pulitzer Prizes for journalism. Major tabloid newspapers in the city include: The New York Daily News, which was founded in 1919 by Joseph Medill Patterson and The New York Post, founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton. The city also has a comprehensive ethnic press, with 270 {{newspapers and}} magazines published in more than 40 languages. El Diario La Prensa is New York's largest Spanish-language daily and the oldest in the nation. The New York Amsterdam News, published in Harlem, is a prominent African American newspaper.

500|$|In 1836, Sarmiento {{returned}} to San Juan, seriously ill with typhoid fever; {{his family and}} friends thought he would die upon his return, but he recovered and established an anti-federalist journal called El Zonda. The government of San Juan did not like Sarmiento's criticisms and censored the magazine by imposing an unaffordable tax upon each purchase. Sarmiento was forced to <b>cease</b> <b>publication</b> of the magazine in 1840. [...] He also founded a school for girls during this time called the Santa Rosa High School, which was a preparatory school. In addition to the school, he founded a Literary Society.|$|E

500|$|The {{story was}} an {{immediate}} success among its young readers. As Harry Thompson remarked, the plotline would have been popular with the average Belgian parent, exploiting their anti-communist sentiment and feeding their fears regarding the Russians. The series' popularity led Wallez to organise publicity stunts to boost interest. The first of these was the April Fools' Day publication of a faked letter purporting {{to be from the}} OGPU (Soviet secret police) confirming Tintin's existence, and warning that if the paper did not <b>cease</b> <b>publication</b> of [...] "these attacks against the Soviets and the revolutionary proletariat of Russia, you will meet death very shortly." ...|$|E
500|$|Fantastic was an American digest size {{fantasy and}} science fiction magazine, {{published}} from 1952 to 1980. It {{was founded by}} Ziff Davis as a fantasy companion to Amazing Stories. [...] Early sales were good, and Ziff Davis quickly decided to switch Amazing from pulp format to digest, and to <b>cease</b> <b>publication</b> of their other science fiction pulp, Fantastic Adventures. [...] Within a few years sales fell, and Howard Browne, the editor, was forced to switch the focus to science fiction rather than fantasy. [...] Browne lost interest in the magazine as a result and the magazine generally ran poor quality fiction in the mid-1950s, under Browne and his successor, Paul W. Fairman.|$|E
500|$|Hamilton's {{editorial}} in the September 1957 issue reported a circulation of 40,000, and starting in January 1958 Nebula went on a regular monthly schedule that was maintained until early 1959. [...] Although Nebulas circulation was strong, only {{about a quarter of}} its sales were in the UK. [...] A further quarter of the sales were in Australia, another third in the US, and nearly a tenth in South Africa. [...] At the end of the 1950s, first South Africa and then Australia began to limit foreign magazine imports, for economic reasons, and when this was followed by UK excise duties the magazine was quickly in debt. [...] Hamilton was forced to <b>cease</b> <b>publication</b> with issue 41, dated June 1959. [...] Hamilton had also had health problems which contributed to his decision to stop publication.|$|E

500|$|Science Fiction was {{not selling}} well, and {{later that year}} Silberkleit merged it with Future Fiction, under the title Future Combined with Science Fiction. [...] The last {{independent}} issue of Science Fiction was dated September 1941, and the first merged issue was dated October 1941. [...] The final two issues of the combined magazine, dated April and June 1943, were, confusingly, titled Science Fiction Stories; this {{was an attempt to}} improve sales by reminding readers of Science Fiction, but before sales figures could be tallied to determine the impact of the title change, Silberkleit made the decision to <b>cease</b> <b>publication.</b> [...] The June 1943 issue was the last for some years: Silberkleit was forced to cut some of his titles because of wartime paper shortages, and he decided to retain his western and detective magazines instead.|$|E
500|$|Astonishing Stories was an American pulp {{science fiction}} magazine, {{published}} by Popular Publications between 1940 and 1943. [...] It was founded under Popular's [...] "Fictioneers" [...] imprint, which paid lower rates than Popular's other magazines. [...] The magazine's first editor was Frederik Pohl, who also edited a companion publication, Super Science Stories. [...] After nine issues Pohl {{was replaced by}} Alden H. Norton, who subsequently rehired Pohl as an assistant. [...] The budget for Astonishing was very low, which {{made it difficult to}} acquire good fiction, but through his membership in the Futurians, a group of young science fiction fans and aspiring writers, Pohl was able to find material to fill the early issues. [...] The magazine was successful, and Pohl was able to increase his pay rates slightly within a year. [...] He managed to obtain stories by writers who subsequently became very well known, such as Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein. [...] After Pohl entered the army in early 1943, wartime paper shortages led Popular to <b>cease</b> <b>publication</b> of Astonishing. [...] The final issue was dated April of that year.|$|E
500|$|Super Science Stories was {{an initial}} success, {{and within a}} year Popular {{increased}} Pohl's budget slightly, allowing him to pay a bonus rate on occasion. [...] Pohl wrote many stories himself, to fill the magazine and to augment his salary. [...] He managed to obtain stories by writers who subsequently became very well known, such as Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein. [...] After Pohl entered the army in early 1943, wartime paper shortages led Popular to <b>cease</b> <b>publication</b> of Super Science Stories. [...] The final issue of the first run was dated May of that year. [...] In 1949 the title was revived with Ejler Jakobsson as editor; this version, which included many reprinted stories, lasted almost three years, with the last issue dated August 1951. [...] A Canadian reprint edition of the first run included material from both Super Science Stories and Astonishing Stories; it was unusual in that it printed some original fiction rather than just reprints. [...] There were also Canadian and British reprint editions of the second incarnation of the magazine.|$|E

500|$|The {{magazine}} was profitable, but the Depression caused Clayton problems. [...] Normally a publisher {{would pay a}} printer three months in arrears, but when a credit squeeze began in May 1931, it led to pressure to reduce this delay. [...] The financial difficulties led Clayton to start alternating {{the publication of his}} magazines, and he switched Astounding to a bimonthly schedule with the June 1932 issue. [...] Some printers bought the magazines which were indebted to them: Clayton decided to buy his printer to prevent this from happening. [...] This proved a disastrous move. [...] Clayton did not have the money to complete the transaction, and in October 1932, Clayton decided to <b>cease</b> <b>publication</b> of Astounding, with the expectation that the January 1933 issue would be the last one. [...] As it turned out, enough stories were in inventory, and enough paper was available, to publish one further issue, so the last Clayton Astounding was dated March 1933. [...] In April, Clayton went bankrupt, and sold his magazine titles to T.R. Foley for $100; Foley resold them in August to Street & Smith, a well-established publisher.|$|E
500|$|When Michael Moorcock, who by {{this time}} had begun selling stories to Carnell, heard of the plans to <b>cease</b> <b>publication</b> of New Worlds and Science Fantasy, {{he wrote a letter}} that {{appeared}} in issue 141 lamenting the loss to the British science fiction field of both the magazines and Carnell himself. [...] Carnell did not want to continue to edit the magazines in addition to New Writings in SF, and recommended Moorcock to Warburton. Kyril Bonfiglioli, an Oxford art dealer who was a friend of Brian Aldiss, also expressed an interest. Warburton gave Moorcock the choice of which magazine to edit; Moorcock chose New Worlds, and Bonfiglioli became the new editor of Science Fantasy. Moorcock wanted to switch to a large format, and showed Warburton a dummy issue he had made up, but Warburton insisted on a paperback format in order to fit in with the other titles they were producing, though he agreed to revisit the format in the future if sales improved. [...] The first issue under Moorcock's control was number 142, dated May/June 1964. [...] The schedule was initially bimonthly, but at the start of 1965 it returned to a stable monthly schedule.|$|E
500|$|With the June issue, {{the title}} was changed to Amazing Detective Tales. [...] Gernsback merged Science Wonder Stories and Air Wonder Stories into Wonder Stories at the same time; he was {{concerned}} that the word [...] "Science" [...] was putting off some potential readers, who assumed that the magazine was, in his words, [...] "a sort of scientific periodical". [...] It {{is likely that the}} same reasoning motivated Scientific Detective Monthlys new title. [...] In the following issue, Grey was replaced as editor by David Lasser, who was already editing Gernsback's other sf titles, and an attempt was made to include more stories with science fiction elements. [...] Gernsback continued the magazine for five issues under the new title; the last issue was dated October 1930. [...] The decision to <b>cease</b> <b>publication</b> was apparently taken suddenly, as the October issue included the announcement that the format would change in November from large to standard pulp size, and listed two stories planned for the November issue. [...] Gernsback sold the title to Wallace Bamber, who published at least five more issues, starting in February 1931; no issues are known for June or July 1931, or after August.|$|E
