40|$|To study multi-fractal {{behavior}} of <b>corroded</b> steel surface, {{a range of}} fractal surfaces of <b>corroded</b> surfaces of Q 235 steel were constructed by using the Weierstrass-Mandelbrot method under a high total accuracy. The multi-fractal spectrum of fractal surface of <b>corroded</b> steel was calculated to study the multi-fractal characteristics of the W-M <b>corroded</b> surface. Based on the shape feature of the multi-fractal spectrum of <b>corroded</b> steel surface, the least squares method {{was applied to the}} quadratic fitting of the multi-fractal spectrum of <b>corroded</b> surface. The fitting function was quantitatively analyzed to simplify the calculation of multi-fractal characteristics of <b>corroded</b> surface. The results showed that the multi-fractal spectrum of <b>corroded</b> surface was fitted well with the method using quadratic curve fitting, and the evolution rules and trends were forecasted accurately. The findings can be applied to research on the mechanisms of <b>corroded</b> surface formation of steel and provide a new approach for the establishment of corrosion damage constitutive models of steel...|$|R

In order {{to investigate the}} strengthening effects of aramid fiber reinforced polymer (AFRP) sheets on the flexural performance of the <b>corroded</b> beams, the flexural behaviors of <b>corroded</b> RC beams strengthened with AFRP sheets under different degrees of corrosion (minor: reinforcement mass loss is 2. 0 %, medium: reinforcement mass loss is 6. 0 %) are researched experimentally in this paper, and {{compared with that of}} the control beams (un-corroded) and un-strengthened <b>corroded</b> beams. The results show that，compared with un-strengthened <b>corroded</b> beams under same degrees of corrosion, the cracking load, yield load and ultimate load of minor <b>corroded</b> RC beam strengthened with AFRP sheets is respectively increased by 20 %, 27 % and 60 %, and increased by 15 %, 36 % and 83 % for medium <b>corroded</b> RC beam strengthened with AFRP sheets respectively; The ultimate deflection of the medium <b>corroded</b> beam strengthened with AFRP sheets is 166 % larger than that of <b>corroded</b> un-strengthened beam. AFRP sheets can improve significantly the bearing capacity and deformation for <b>corroded</b> RC beams. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 110 inelastic {{buckling}} tests on <b>corroded</b> and uncorroded reinforcing bars with various bar diameters are conducted. Through regression analyses of experimental data the combined effect of nonuniform pitting corrosion and bar diameter (size effect) on buckling and post-yield buckling response of <b>corroded</b> and uncorroded bars are investigated. The experimental result shows that bar diameter has a minor influence on post-yield buckling response of uncorroded bars. However, {{it is found}} that bar diameter has a more significant impact on buckling capacity of <b>corroded</b> bars. Finally, the experimental data of tested <b>corroded</b> bars in this research are used to calibrate and update a new uniaxial material model of <b>corroded</b> bars to account for size effect. The proposed updated model simulates the inelastic buckling and post-buckling behaviour of <b>corroded</b> bars accounting for size effect. This model is implemented in an open source finite element code and is readily available to the community for nonlinear analysis of <b>corroded</b> reinforced concrete structure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{failure mode}} of the <b>corroded</b> RC beam may shift from {{designed}} failure mode to others failure mode, as the load resisting mechanism changes {{due to the}} corrosion ratio of rebars. In this study, the load resisting mechanism and the failure mode of the <b>corroded</b> RC beam were investigated based on the bond performance. If the <b>corroded</b> RC beam is non-uniformly <b>corroded,</b> the beam suffers beam action and fails in flexural failure. Otherwise, the load resisting mechanism and the failure mode depend on the corrosion ratio of bottom portion stirrups. Moreover, the decision point is proposed to predict the load resisting mechanisms in the <b>corroded</b> RC beam...|$|R

The investigation found that the collapse was caused by a two-stage failure of the welding on a connection, due to extensive corrosion.

In this paper, the traditional and new methods are respectively used to calculate and contrastively analyze the failure probability of <b>corroded</b> pipeline; we then perform the research of residual life prediction for the <b>corroded</b> pipeline, followed by the sensitivity calculation of all random evaluation parameters. And then the Monte Carlo method (MCS) is applied to verify the rationality of the new method. The research results show that: the method considering associated defect is more objective, and truly react <b>corroded</b> pipeline's dynamic reliability changes; obtain new method to predict residual life of <b>corroded</b> pipeline; corrosion depth, radial corrosion rate {{have a significant impact}} on reliability of <b>corroded</b> pipeline considering associated defects.

5|$|Contamination {{by water}} during filling {{may be due}} to two causes. Inadequate {{filtration}} and drying of the compressed air can introduce small quantities of fresh water condensate, or an emulsion of water and compressor lubricant, and failing to clear the cylinder valve orifice of water which may have dripped from wet dive gear, which can allow contamination by fresh or seawater. Both cause corrosion, but seawater contamination can cause a cylinder to <b>corrode</b> rapidly {{to the extent that it}} may be unsafe or condemned after even a fairly short period. This problem is exacerbated in hot climates, where chemical reactions are faster, and is more prevalent where filling staff are badly trained or overworked.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{physical}} similarities which they share, the group 12 elements {{can be found in}} many common situations.

30|$|Additionally, the {{development}} of a fatigue assessment model (FAM) for <b>corroded</b> members is not an easy task due to the many relevant parameters and variables that determine the fatigue behavior. Several {{attempts have been made to}} develop an FAM for <b>corroded</b> beams. The most common approaches are the stress-life and strain-life models (Ma et al. 2014; Elrefai et al. 2012). These models provide the fatigue life of members but do not predict the strain and stress distributions across the beam. Song and Yu (2015) tested beams with <b>corroded</b> steel reinforcement (<b>corroded</b> beams) strengthened with CFRP sheets and proposed an analytical fatigue prediction model (FPM) to assess the fatigue behavior of the CFRP-strengthened <b>corroded</b> beams. In this study, the effect of prestressed CFRP systems on the fatigue behavior of <b>corroded</b> RC beams was not studied. None of the available FAMs are capable of accurately assessing the fatigue behavior of <b>corroded</b> beams strengthened with prestressed CFRP. This paper presents the second phase of a research project conducted to quantify the effect of CFRP systems on the fatigue behavior of <b>corroded</b> RC beams. The first phase of the project (Song and Yu 2015) aimed to examine the effect of steel corrosion and the non-prestressed CFRP systems on the fatigue behavior of <b>corroded</b> RC beams. The results showed that non-prestressed CFRP systems are applicable to RC beams with only low corrosion degrees (0 – 4.6 %). The second phase intends to develop an overall assessment model capable of assessing the fatigue behavior of <b>corroded</b> RC beams strengthened with prestressed CFRP sheets and to discuss whether prestressed CFRP systems are applicable to RC beams with medium and high corrosion degrees.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{experimental}} data {{of a total}} of 172 tests of <b>corroded</b> reinforced concrete (RC) beams published in literature was summarized. Comparative studies between experimental results and predictions of existing empirical models of shear capacity of <b>corroded</b> RC beams were carried out. Results show that existing models underestimate the shear capacity of <b>corroded</b> beams and the scatter of the predictions is large. Based on these investigations, an empirical model for predicting shear strength of <b>corroded</b> RC beams under centralized load developed from Eurocode 2 was proposed. Important factors such as the yield strength of <b>corroded</b> steel bar, effective cross-section width of rust girder, and the reduction of shear strength due to the corrosion of stirrups and longitudinal tensile reinforcement were taken into account. An application of the proposed model to the published {{experimental data}} demonstrates that the present model gives a good representation of the shear strength of <b>corroded</b> RC beams...|$|R

5|$|The {{relative}} {{reactivity of}} zinc {{and its ability}} to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection (CP). For example, cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe. Zinc acts as the anode (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline. Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water. A zinc disc attached to a ship's iron rudder will slowly <b>corrode</b> while the rudder stays intact. Similarly, a zinc plug attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship provides temporary protection.|$|E
5|$|A {{cylinder}} boot is a {{hard rubber}} or plastic cover which fits over {{the base of a}} diving cylinder to protect the paint from abrasion and impact, to protect the surface the cylinder stands on from impact with the cylinder, {{and in the case of}} round bottomed cylinders, to allow the cylinder to stand upright on its base. Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of the cylinder to roll on a flat surface. It is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between the boot and the cylinder, and if this is seawater and the paint under the boot is in poor condition, the surface of the cylinder may <b>corrode</b> in those areas. This can usually be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place. The added hydrodynamic drag caused by a cylinder boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver, but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on the environment.|$|E

Material tests on concrete and <b>corroded</b> rebar were also conducted. Loading tests were performed on three <b>corroded</b> beams. The residual bending strengths obtained from the test results were compared with design strengths of uncorroded beam. It is shown that the <b>corroded</b> beams lost most of their strengths.

40|$|Although {{extensive}} research on steel corrosion in concrete has been undertaken {{it is more}} on longitudinal reinforcing bars than stirrups as suggested in the review of published literature. The effect of corrosion of steel stirrups on structural behaviour can be significant for shear failure mode. This paper aims to investigate the degradation of mechanical behaviour of <b>corroded</b> stirrups. Details of a comprehensive experiment designed to examine the mechanical behaviour of <b>corroded</b> stirrups in concrete structural members are presented. A micromechanical damage model for failure mechanism of <b>corroded</b> stirrups is proposed and a model for damage factor is derived. Based on these models, a constitutive model for <b>corroded</b> stirrups is developed and verified with test results. It {{is found in the}} experiment that both the strength and ductility of <b>corroded</b> stirrups decrease with the increase of corrosion and that the hemispherical model for the pit shape is more appropriate for the prediction of strength reduction of <b>corroded</b> stirrups. The constitutive model developed in the paper can be used to predict the mechanical behaviour of <b>corroded</b> stirrups with reasonable accuracy, paving the way for the assessment of corrosion induced shear failure of reinforced concrete structures...|$|R
40|$|Tripping of {{stiffeners}} {{is one of}} the buckling {{modes of}} stiffened panel which could rapidly lead to its catastrophic failure. Loss of thickness in web and flange due to corrosion reduces elastic buckling strength of stiffeners. It is common practice to assume a uniform thickness reduction for general corrosion. Since the real <b>corroded</b> plate has rough surfaces, to estimate the remaining strength of <b>corroded</b> structures, typically a much higher level of accuracy is required. There is a little study on strength analysis of <b>corroded</b> plates with rough surface especially as a function of corrosion degrees. The aim of present work is to analyze elastic tripping stress of flat bar stiffeners with both-sided <b>corroded</b> surfaces. Undulated surfaces are generated based on the power spectrum of the <b>corroded</b> surface. Elastic tripping stress is calculated using ANSYS code. Finite elements method is employed to analyze elastic tripping stress of <b>corroded</b> steel flat bars with both sided rough surfaces. Comparing the results with elastic tripping strength of <b>corroded</b> flat bars with uniform thickness, a reduction factor is proposed. It is found that reduction factor of buckling strength by uniform thickness assumption is overestimated...|$|R
5|$|As {{expected}} from periodic trends, lanthanum {{has the largest}} atomic radius of the lanthanides and the stable group 3 elements. Hence, {{it is the most}} reactive among them, tarnishing slowly in air and burning readily to form lanthanum(III) oxide, La2O3, which is almost as basic as calcium oxide. A centimeter-sized sample of lanthanum will <b>corrode</b> completely in a year as its oxide spalls off like iron rust, instead of forming a protective oxide coating like aluminium and lanthanum's lighter congeners scandium and yttrium. Lanthanum reacts with the halogens at room temperature to form the trihalides, and upon warming will form binary compounds with the nonmetals nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, boron, selenium, silicon and arsenic. Lanthanum reacts slowly with water to form lanthanum(III) hydroxide, La(OH)3. In dilute sulfuric acid, lanthanum readily forms the aquated tripositive ion : this is colorless in aqueous solution since La3+ has no f electrons. Lanthanum is the strongest and hardest base among the lanthanides and group 3 elements, which is again {{expected from}} its being the largest of them.|$|E

5|$|Gerard Bond {{suggests}} {{that changes in}} the flux of solar energy on a 1,500-year scale may be correlated to the Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles, and in turn the Heinrich events; however the small magnitude {{of the change in}} energy makes such an exo-terrestrial factor unlikely to have the required large effects, at least without huge positive feedback processes acting within the Earth system. However, rather than the warming itself melting the ice, it is possible that sea-level change associated with the warming destabilised ice shelves. A rise in sea level could begin to <b>corrode</b> the bottom of an ice sheet, undercutting it; when one ice sheet failed and surged, the ice released would further raise sea levels, and further destabilizing other ice sheets. In favour of this theory is the non-simultaneity of ice sheet break-up in H1, H2, H4, and H5, where European breakup preceded European melting by up to 1,500years (Maslin et al. 2001).|$|E
