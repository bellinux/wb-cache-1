5|$|In the past, most coat <b>colors</b> <b>were</b> found, {{including}} spotted patterns. Today most Andalusians are gray or bay; in the US, around 80 {{percent of}} all Andalusians are gray. Of the remaining horses, approximately 15 percent are bay and 5 percent are black, dun or palomino or chestnut. Other colors, such as buckskin, pearl, and cremello, are rare, but are recognized as allowed colors by registries for the breed.|$|E

5|$|Appointed to be {{commander}} of the Austrian winter cordon, Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser ordered a small assault column {{under the command of}} Colonel Wilhelm Klebeck to attack the village of Dittersbach. Klebeck led a column of Croats into the village. During the action, four hundred Prussians were killed, another four hundred made prisoner, and eight <b>colors</b> <b>were</b> captured.

5|$|Confederate Army {{officers}} {{indicated their}} military affiliation with different colored facing on their coats or jackets. The <b>colors</b> <b>were</b> red for artillery, yellow for cavalry, light blue for infantry, and black for medical. A very distinctive {{feature of the}} Confederate officers uniforms was the gold braid Austrian knots on their sleeves. More elaborate braiding indicated higher rank and some knots almost reached the shoulder. However, a general order, issued in 1862, called for the Austrian knots not to be worn in the field, as this made officers conspicuous to enemy combatants.|$|E

5|$|The basic German (Luftwaffe) {{camouflage}} {{during most}} of the war was based on a light blue undersurface and a two tone splinter pattern of various greens for the upper surfaces. In {{the first year of the}} war, the top <b>colors</b> <b>were</b> dark green and black-green; later, lighter and more greyish <b>colors</b> <b>were</b> used for fighters, though bombers mostly maintained the dark green/black green camouflage. The side of the fuselage on fighters and some light bombers often had irregular patches sprayed on, softening the transition from the upper to the lower surface. The undersides of night bombers and night fighters were painted black early in the war, but by 1943 switched to lighter base colors of their usual light blue undersurfaces for aircraft flown by day, and a light gray base coat over the upper surfaces to match the skyglow over the German cities they were tasked with defending. A special pattern was devised for the Mediterranean front, consisting of a sand yellow that often faded to tan, with or without olive green patches. As Germany lost air supremacy, ground camouflage became increasingly important, and late war fighters received a two tone scheme like the British Sand and Spinach, in dark brown and light green.|$|E

5|$|The brigade was {{inactive}} for a {{year while}} it was reconstructed in Hawaii. As {{a part of the}} transformation of the US Army, the brigade was reorganized into a modular force with new and updated equipment and new personnel. The Brigade stood up provisionally on 27 June 2008 as it neared ready status. On 23 October, the brigade's <b>colors</b> <b>were</b> formally uncased at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. This signified the end of the brigade's relocation to Hawaii as well as its completion and readiness to take on new missions.|$|E
5|$|The {{flag of the}} Grand Duchy of Posen, a Polish-populated {{autonomous}} province of the Kingdom of Prussia created in 1815, was a red-and-white horizontal bicolor. Its <b>colors</b> <b>were</b> taken from the duchy's coat of arms which consisted of the Prussian Black Eagle with an inescutcheon of the Polish White Eagle. With Germany's increasingly anti-Polish policy and a rising identification of white and red as Polish national colors, the red-and-white flag of Posen was replaced in 1886 with a white-black-white horizontal triband. No other part of Poland {{during the time of}} Partitions used a flag that would incorporate Polish national colors.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} flag {{has been in}} use since June 7, 1995, one of two symbols adopted in the 1995 referendum. The main elements of the flag is a red and green bicolor, then decorated with an ornament pattern at the hoist position. The current flag is a modification of the 1951 flag used while the country was a republic of the Soviet Union. In the Soviet version, a hammer and sickle was placed near the top-hoist corner and the ornament <b>colors</b> <b>were</b> inverted. Several flags used by government officials and agencies {{were based on the}} {{national flag}}.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not known}} who {{originally}} suggested the yellow, green and red, but the idea is usually attributed to Lithuanian exiles living elsewhere in Europe or in the United States during the 19th century. These three <b>colors</b> <b>were</b> frequently used in folk weavings and traditional dress. At the Great Seimas of Vilnius of 1905, this flag was favored over the Vytis banner as {{the flag of the}} Lithuanian nation. The Vytis, strongly advocated by Jonas Basanavičius, was not chosen for three reasons: the first was that as part of the drive for national identity, the Seimas wished to distance itself somewhat from the flag of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which also encompassed now-distinct nations such as Belarus, and Ukraine. The second issue was the choice of the color red by revolutionaries who aligned themselves with Marxist or Communist causes. And finally, the flag with Vytis would be too complicated and could not be easily sewn.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario RPG was {{released}} on Virtual Console for Wii in Japan on June 24, 2008. It {{was released}} {{for the first time}} in Europe and Australia on August 22, 2008 on Virtual Console for Wii, as part of the third Hanabi Festival (a period in which several games not previously available in Europe are released on the Wii's Virtual Console). It {{was released on}} Virtual Console for Wii in North America on September 1, 2008, with the distinction of being the 250th Virtual Console game released in that region. Super Mario RPG was released on Virtual Console for Wii U in Japan on August 5, 2015, in Europe and Australia on December 24, 2015, and in North America on June 30, 2016. In the Virtual Console releases, certain animations, namely those for the Flame Wall and Static E! attacks, were dimmed to reduce the potential for triggering sensitive players' seizures, and <b>colors</b> <b>were</b> adjusted.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the subject began with the {{development}} in the 19th century of wave mechanics and the exploration of phenomena associated with the Doppler effect. The effect is named after Christian Doppler, who offered the first known physical explanation for the phenomenon in 1842. The hypothesis was tested and confirmed for sound waves by the Dutch scientist Christophorus Buys Ballot in 1845. Doppler correctly predicted that the phenomenon should apply to all waves, and in particular suggested that the varying colors of stars {{could be attributed to}} their motion with respect to the Earth. Before this was verified, however, it was found that stellar <b>colors</b> <b>were</b> primarily due to a star's temperature, not motion. Only later was Doppler vindicated by verified redshift observations.|$|E
50|$|Eye <b>color</b> <b>is</b> {{determined}} {{primarily by}} the concentration and distribution of melanin within the iris tissues. Although the processes determining eye <b>color</b> <b>are</b> not fully understood, {{it is known that}} inherited eye <b>color</b> <b>is</b> determined by multiple genes. Environmental or acquired factors can alter these inherited traits.|$|R
50|$|<b>Colors</b> <b>are</b> not in light. <b>Colors</b> <b>are</b> {{nothing more}} than the eye's activity, {{appearing}} in polar contrasts. Philosophers have always surmised that color belongs to the eye rather than to things. Locke, for example, claimed that <b>color</b> <b>was</b> at the head of his list of secondary qualities.|$|R
5000|$|The accent <b>color</b> <b>is</b> the {{secondary}} <b>color</b> used in stamped concrete. The secondary <b>color</b> <b>is</b> {{used to produce}} texture and show additional building materials (e.g. grout) in the stamped concrete. The accent <b>color</b> <b>is</b> produced by applying color release to the concrete. Color release has two purposes. <b>Color</b> release <b>is</b> a pigment used to color the concrete and <b>color</b> release <b>is</b> a non-adhesive used to prevent the concrete stamps from sticking to the concrete.|$|R
5|$|The university's {{colors are}} garnet and gold. The colors of garnet and gold {{represent}} a merging of the university's past. While the school fielded {{a football team}} as early, or earlier than 1899, in 1902, 1903 and 1905 the team won football championships wearing purple and gold uniforms. The following year, the college student body selected crimson as the official school color. The administration in 1905 took crimson and combined it with the recognizable purple of the championship football teams to achieve the color garnet. After World War II the garnet and gold <b>colors</b> <b>were</b> first worn by a renewed football team in a 14–6 loss to Stetson University on October 18, 1947. Florida State University's marching band is the Marching Chiefs.|$|E
5|$|Visual display was prized. Brilliant <b>colors</b> <b>were</b> {{obtained}} by the addition of, for example, juices from spinach and the green part of leeks. Yellow came from saffron or egg yolk, while red came from sunflower, and purple came from Crozophora tinctoria or Heliotropium europaeum. Gold and silver leaf were placed on food surfaces and brushed with egg whites. Elaborate and showy dishes were the result, such as tourte parmerienne which was a pastry dish {{made to look like}} a castle with chicken-drumstick turrets coated with gold leaf. One of the grandest showpieces of the time was roast swan or peacock sewn back into its skin with feathers intact, the feet and beak being gilded. Since both birds are stringy, and taste unpleasant, the skin and feathers could be kept and filled with the cooked, minced and seasoned flesh of tastier birds, like goose or chicken.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is common}} amongst spiders, both in luring prey and stealthily {{approaching}} predators. One {{case is the}} golden orb weaver (Nephila clavipes), which spins a conspicuous golden colored web in well-lit areas. Experiments show that bees are able to associate the webs with danger when the yellow pigment is not present, as occurs in less well-lit areas where the web is much harder to see. Other <b>colors</b> <b>were</b> also learned and avoided, but bees seemed least able to effectively associate yellow pigmented webs with danger. Yellow {{is the color of}} many nectar bearing flowers, however, so perhaps avoiding yellow is not worth while. Another form of mimicry is based not on color but pattern. Species such as Argiope argentata employ prominent patterns {{in the middle of their}} webs, such as zigzags. These may reflect ultraviolet light, and mimic the pattern seen in many flowers known as nectar guides. Spiders change their web day to day, which can be explained by bees' ability to remember web patterns. Bees are able to associate a certain pattern with a spatial location, meaning the spider must spin a new pattern regularly or suffer diminishing prey capture.|$|E
