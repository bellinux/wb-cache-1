40|$|Information {{about the}} pairing {{mechanism}} for superconductivity {{is contained in}} the spectral weight for the anomalous (Gorkov) Green function. In the most general case, this spectral weight can change sign on the positive real axis or even be complex {{in the presence of}} broken time-reversal symmetry. This renders impossible the direct analytic <b>continuation</b> <b>with</b> Maximum Entropy methods of numerical results obtained for the anomalous Green function either in Matsubara frequency or in imaginary time. Here we show that one can define auxiliary Green functions that allow one to extract the anomalous spectral weight in the most general multi-orbital spin-singlet or triplet cases with no particular symmetry. As a simple example, we treat the case of lead in Eliashberg theory: Maximum Entropy analytic <b>continuation</b> <b>with</b> auxiliary Green functions (MaxEntAux) allows us to recover spectral functions that change sign on the positive real axis. The approach can be extended to transport quantities...|$|R

40|$|The Scheme {{language}} {{does not}} fully specify the semantics of combination: the evaluation order of the terms composing a combination is left indeterminate. We investigate in this paper a different semantics for Scheme where terms of combinations are evaluated concurrently. The resulting semantics models a language with concurrent threads sharing a common workspace. The semantics is given in terms of denotational semantics and uses resumptions {{as well as a}} choice operator: oneof which mimics a scheduler. An alternate definition for this operator lets appear the classical powerdomains. The main interest of this operator is to offer a formalization that can be read with an operational point of view while keeping a firm theoretical base. Scheme also offers first class <b>continuations</b> <b>with</b> indefinite extent; we examine some semantics for <b>continuations</b> <b>with</b> respect to concurrency. Each of these semantics is a natural extension of the sequential case of regular Scheme. Still they strongly differ [...] ...|$|R
