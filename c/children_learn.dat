5|$|A study {{conducted}} by a United States child psychiatrist, Dr Kyle D. Pruett, found that infants between 7 and 30 months responded more favorably to being picked up by their fathers. Pruett also found that a father's parenting style is beneficial for a child's physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioral development. Mothers reassure toddlers when they become frustrated while fathers encourage them to manage their frustration. This helps the <b>children</b> <b>learn</b> to deal with stress and frustration. A long-term study Pruett conducted proved that a father's active involvement with his children, from birth to adolescence, promotes greater emotional balance, stronger curiosity and a stronger sense of self-assurance in the child.|$|E
5|$|Besides Japanese, the Ryukyuan {{languages}} (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), {{also part}} of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain. Few <b>children</b> <b>learn</b> these languages, but in recent years the local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages. The Okinawan Japanese dialect is also spoken in the region. The Ainu language, which has no proven relationship to Japanese or any other language, is moribund, with only a few elderly native speakers remaining in Hokkaido. Public and private schools generally require students to take Japanese language classes as well as English language courses.|$|E
5|$|Both {{linguistic}} and socio-cultural factors affect {{the rate at}} which vocabulary develops. Children must learn to use their words appropriately and strategically in social situations. They have flexible and powerful social-cognitive skills that allow them to understand the communicative intentions of others {{in a wide variety of}} interactive situations. <b>Children</b> <b>learn</b> new words in communicative situations. Children rely on pragmatic skills to build more extensive vocabularies. Some aspects of pragmatic behaviour can predict later literacy and mathematical achievement, as children who are pragmatically skilled often function better in school. These children are also generally better liked.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the association between family dining practices, parenting style and family functioning with <b>child</b> <b>learning</b> among Chinese families with preschool children. Participants included 663 parent-child dyads recruited from Hong Kong preschools. <b>Child</b> <b>learning</b> was measured through individual assessment of children on preschool concepts, parent and teacher report of <b>child</b> <b>learning.</b> Parents completed questionnaires on parenting style, family functioning, frequency of parents/grandparents dining with target children, mealtime television viewing and feeding practice. Child attainment of preschool concepts was associated with child sex and frequency of father eating with child. Parent report of <b>child</b> <b>learning</b> was associated with child sex, parenting style, family functioning and family feeding practice. Teacher report of <b>child</b> <b>learning</b> was associated with <b>child</b> sex. <b>Child</b> <b>learning</b> could potentially be influenced by family practice including family dining practices, parenting style and family functioning.

40|$|To test {{general and}} {{specific}} processes of symbol learning, 4 - and 5 - year-old <b>children</b> <b>learned</b> {{three kinds of}} abstract associates for novel objects: words, facts, and pictograms. To test fast mapping (i. e., one-trial learning) and subsequent learning, comprehension was tested after each of four exposures. Production was also tested, as was children’s tendency to generalize learned items to new objects in the same taxon. To test for a bias toward mutually exclu- sive associations, <b>children</b> <b>learned</b> either one-to-one or many-to- many mappings. In Experiment 1, <b>children</b> <b>learned</b> words, facts (with or without incidental novel words), or pictograms. In Experiment 2, <b>children</b> <b>learned</b> words or pictograms. In both of these experiments, <b>children</b> <b>learned</b> words slower than facts and pictograms. Pictograms and facts were generalized more systematically than words, but only in Experiment 1. <b>Children</b> <b>learned</b> one-to-one mappings faster only in Experiment 2, when cognitive load was increased. In Experiment 3, 3 - and 4 -year-olds were taught facts (with novel words), words, and pictograms. <b>Children</b> <b>learned</b> facts faster than words; however, they remembered all items equally well a week later. The results suggest that word learning follows non-specialized memory and associative learning processes...|$|R

5|$|Critics {{argue that}} {{theories}} of constraints {{focus on how}} <b>children</b> <b>learn</b> nouns, but ignore other aspects of their word learning. Although constraints are useful in explaining how children limit possible meanings when learning novel words, the same constraints would eventually need to be overridden {{because they are not}} utilized in adult language. For instance, adult speakers often use several terms, each term meaning something slightly different, when referring to one entity, such as a family pet. This practice would violate the mutual exclusivity constraint.|$|E

5|$|While {{humans have}} the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an {{environment}} in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on communities of speakers in which <b>children</b> <b>learn</b> language from their elders and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to communicate and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes. Due {{to the way in which}} language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to language contact. The process is similar to the process of evolution, where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a phylogenetic tree.|$|E
5|$|The <b>children</b> <b>learn</b> that A Lady Writing was {{traveling}} from The National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. to Hyde Park. The next day {{there is a}} story in the paper of how the painting mysteriously disappeared. A letter from the thief appears in the newspaper, telling the public that he will not give back A Lady Writing until they prove which Vermeer paintings were truly painted by him. This sparks worldwide uproar. Calder and Petra investigate as their friendship grows. Mrs. Sharpe requests police protection and it is revealed that she and Ms. Hussey were two of the three recipients of the thief's letter. Calder and Petra eventually conclude that the painting is hidden in the local Delia Dell Hall, and they sneak out and find it. They barely escape from the thief, who is later found dead from a massive heart attack on the train by the police. They learn that the man is Xavier Glitts,also known as Glitter Man,who was posing as Tommy's stepfather under the name Fred Steadman. A known art thief, he was asked to steal the painting and sell it for sixty million dollars. The other recipient of the letter is revealed to be Mr. Watch.|$|E
5|$|As {{children}} get older their rate of vocabulary growth increases. Children probably understand their first 50 words before they produce them. By {{the age of}} eighteen months, children typically attain a vocabulary of 50 words in production, and between two and three times greater in comprehension. A switch from {{an early stage of}} slow vocabulary growth to a later stage of faster growth {{is referred to as the}} vocabulary spurt. Young toddlers acquire one to three words per month. A vocabulary spurt often occurs over time as the number of words learned accelerates. It is believed that most children add about 10 to 20 new words a week. Between the ages of 18 to 24 months, <b>children</b> <b>learn</b> how to combine two words such as no bye-bye and more please. Three-word and four-word combinations appear when most of the child's utterances are two-word productions. In addition, children are able to form conjoined sentences, using and. This suggests that there is a vocabulary spurt between the time that the child's first word appears, and when the child is able to form more than two words, and eventually, sentences. However, there have been arguments as to whether or not there is a spurt in acquisition of words. Only about one in five children do have a spurt. This suggests that most children do not have a vocabulary spurt.|$|E
30|$|There {{are also}} {{implications}} {{in terms of}} strengthening parent and caregiver practices. As noted in the introduction, a parent’s use of practices that are efficacious in terms of affecting <b>child</b> <b>learning</b> is dependent, in part, {{on his or her}} recognition {{of the fact that the}} parent was the agent of <b>child</b> <b>learning.</b> This recognition, called parenting mindfulness (Cohen and Semple 2010), is a necessary condition for continued use of practices to affect changes in <b>child</b> <b>learning</b> and behavior. Early childhood practitioners who are knowledgeable of the fact that proximal and distal parent social-emotional responding are behavior indications of not only well-being but also indicators of mindfulness when a parent recognizes and acknowledges his or her role in <b>child</b> <b>learning</b> can use observations of those indicators to reinforce parenting confidence and competence.|$|R
40|$|This mini-review {{focuses on}} the {{question}} of how the grammatical number system of a child’s language may help the <b>child</b> <b>learn</b> the meanings of cardinal number words (e. g., ‘one’ and ‘two’). Evidence from young <b>children</b> <b>learning</b> English, Russian, Japanese, Mandarin, Slovenian or Saudi Arabic suggests that trajectories of number-word <b>learning</b> differ for <b>children</b> <b>learning</b> different languages. <b>Children</b> <b>learning</b> English, which distinguishes between singular and plural, seem to learn the meaning of the cardinal number ‘one’ earlier than <b>children</b> <b>learning</b> Japanese or Mandarin, which have very little singular/plural marking. Similarly, children whose languages have a singular/dual/plural system (Slovenian and Saudi Arabic) learn the meaning of ‘two’ earlier than English-speaking children. This relation between grammatical and cardinal number may shed light on how humans acquire cardinal-number concepts. There is an ongoing debate about whether mental symbols for small cardinalities (concepts for ‘oneness,’ ‘twoness,’ etc.) are innate or learned. Although an effect of grammatical number on number-word learning does not rule out nativist accounts, it seems more consistent with constructivist accounts, which portray the number-learning process as one that requires significant conceptual change...|$|R

5|$|Joint {{attention}} {{is an important}} mechanism through which <b>children</b> <b>learn</b> to map words-to-world, and vice versa. Adults commonly make an attempt to establish joint attention with a child before they convey something to the child. Joint {{attention is}} often accompanied by physical co-presence, since children are often focused on what is in their immediate environment. As well, conversational co-presence is likely to occur; the caregiver and child typically talk together about whatever is taking place at their locus of joint attention. Social pragmatic perspectives often present children as covariation detectors, who simply associate the words that they hear with whatever they are attending to {{in the world at}} the same time. The co-variation detection model of joint attention seems problematic when we consider that many caregiver utterances do not refer to things that occupy the immediate attentional focus of infants. For instance, caregivers among the Kaluli, a group of indigenous peoples living in New Guinea, rarely provide labels {{in the context of their}} referents. While the covariation detection model emphasizes the caregiver's role in the meaning-making process, some theorists argue that infants also play an important role in their own word learning, actively avoiding mapping errors. When infants are in situations where their own attentional focus differs from that of a speaker, they seek out information about the speaker's focus, and then use that information to establish correct word-referent mappings. Joint attention can be created through infant agency, in an attempt to gather information about a speaker's intent.|$|E

25|$|Other {{researchers}} embrace an interactionist perspective, {{consisting of}} social-interactionist theories of language development.
