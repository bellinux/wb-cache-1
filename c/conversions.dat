5|$|The {{first wave}} of forced <b>conversions</b> in the Crown of Aragon {{happened}} during the Revolt of the Brotherhoods. Rebellion bearing an anti-Muslim sentiment broke out among the Christian subjects of Valencia in the early 1520s, and those active in it forced Muslims to become Christians in the territories they controlled. Muslims joined the Crown in suppressing the rebellion, playing crucial roles in several battles. After the rebellion was suppressed, the Muslims regarded the <b>conversions</b> forced by the rebels as invalid and returned to their faith. Subsequently, King Charles I (also known as Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire) started an investigation to determine {{the validity of the}} <b>conversions.</b> The commission tasked with this investigation started working in November 1524. Charles ultimately upheld the <b>conversions,</b> putting the forcibly converted subjects under the authority of the Inquisition. Supporters of this decision argued that the Muslims had a choice when confronted by the rebels: they could have chosen to refuse and die, but did not, indicating that the <b>conversions</b> happened out of free will and must remain in effect.|$|E

40|$|This work investigates one {{biochemical}} and one thermochemical biomass-to-liquid biofuel <b>conversion</b> pathway {{in terms}} of lignocellulose <b>conversion</b> to liquid Fischer-Tropsch diesel. The {{focus has been on}} comparing the two <b>conversion</b> pathways {{in terms of}} identifying their energy flows and respective feed to fuel ratios. The <b>conversion</b> pathways investigated comprise two-stage <b>conversion</b> sequences including biomass-to-gas <b>conversion</b> and gas-to-liquid <b>conversion,</b> exerted by anaerobic digestion or gasification followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. A systematic documentation of available technologies regarding the two <b>conversion</b> pathways is performed by literature study. The pathways are modeled in Aspen Plus supplied with FORTRAN declarations. Mass flows and composition for the two pathways are collected from simulations and energy flows are identified by heating value and energy balance calculations. The energy flows are presented graphically and by ESankey-diagrams, and the resulting energy utilities and feed to fuel ratios are presented graphically and in tabular form. The key finding is that for the application to Fischer-Tropsch processes, the biochemical <b>conversion</b> pathway is less energy effective in terms of gas-to-liquid <b>conversion.</b> This result is observed both in terms of energy utility for the pathway and might indicate that biochemical pathways are more energy consuming than conventional thermochemical gas-to-liquid <b>conversion.</b> However, results on feed to fuel ratio indicate that the biochemical <b>conversion</b> of lignocellulose to Fischer-Tropsch diesel is competitive when compared to thermochemical <b>conversion.</b> </p...|$|R
