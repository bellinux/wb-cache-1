Posebnu pozornost posvećuje Hrvatskome katoličkom senioratu, elitnoj svećeničko- svjetovnjačkoj organizaciji i Hrvatskoj pučkoj stranci. The instigator of the Croatian Catholic Movement was the Bishop of Krk, Antun Mahnić (1903). It {{was on his}} {{own initiative}} that the Croatian Catholic Seniority — an exclusive organisation of secular and clerical intelligence — was established. In December 1912, the seniors — a circle around Dr Petar Rogulja — published their “political programme article” in which they declared themselves to be in favour of the “national unity” of the Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. After the “May Declaration” of 1917 had been published — whose ultimate goal was the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy and the constitution of the Yugoslav state — the Seniority accepted its political principles. In proportion to their numerical strength, the Seniors joined the National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs and actively participated in the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy and the constitution of the first Yugoslav union of states — the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (1918). In the Parliamentary life of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (1919 — 1929), the <b>Croatian</b> <b>People</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Party</b> also participated. It was a “political branch” of the Croatian Catholic Movement, thus its integral part. Although the Yugoslav Catholic episcopate approved of the principles on the basis of which the party 2 ̆ 7 s politics was supposed to be led, that did not — in the least — mean that it accepted responsibility for the concrete political activity of the <b>Croatian</b> <b>People</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Party.</b> Partaking in the political life of the then state, the <b>Croatian</b> <b>People</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Party</b> reached its peak in the elections for the Constituent Assembly (1920). In their “detached view” of the draught of the Government 2 ̆ 7 s Constitution, the members of the <b>Croatian</b> <b>People</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Party</b> advocated the autonomous system of government of the Yugoslav union of states. After the assassination of Stjepan Radić and his party members, the president of the <b>Croatian</b> <b>People</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Party,</b> Stjepan Barić, joined the coalition government of the Rev Anton Koroπec, president of the Slovene People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Party</b> (1928). Barić 2 ̆ 7 s move caused the definite disappearance of the party from the Croatian political stage...|$|R
