5|$|An {{attacker}} having gained authentication material may impersonate the material's owner {{after the}} victim has patched Heartbleed, {{as long as}} the material is accepted (for example, until the password is changed or the private key revoked). Heartbleed therefore constitutes a critical threat to <b>confidentiality.</b> However, an attacker impersonating a victim may also alter data. Indirectly, Heartbleed's consequences may thus go far beyond a <b>confidentiality</b> breach for many systems.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the promise}} of <b>confidentiality,</b> the AEC {{released}} an edited transcript of the hearing in June 1954, after press publicity of the hearing. The unredacted transcripts were released in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In May 2015, Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr {{proposed}} random {{checks of}} pilots' psychological fitness and a loosening of the extant physician–patient <b>confidentiality</b> laws. Politicians began echoing {{the call for}} a loosening of the laws in exceptional cases.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{interviews}} Laurence Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn), {{a psychiatrist}} who had been seeing Laura. Jacoby {{does not wish to}} breach his <b>confidentiality</b> agreement, but admits that he struggled to understand Laura's problems. He also casts suspicion on a man driving a red Corvette—Leo Johnson (Eric Da Re).|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Corzine {{refused to}} release his {{income tax return}} records. He claimed an {{interest}} in doing so, but he cited a <b>confidentiality</b> agreement with Goldman Sachs. Skeptics argued that Corzine should have followed the example of his predecessor Robert Rubin, who converted his equity stake into debt upon leaving Goldman.|$|E
5|$|In August 2014, it {{was made}} public that the Heartbleed {{vulnerability}} enabled hackers to steal security keys from Community Health Systems, the second-biggest for-profit U.S. hospital chain in the United States, compromising the <b>confidentiality</b> of 4.5 million patient records. The breach happened a week after Heartbleed was first made public.|$|E
5|$|Krug {{strongly}} opposed {{the notion that}} libraries ought to censor the material that they provide to patrons. She supported laws and policies protecting the <b>confidentiality</b> of library use records. When the United States Department of Justice used {{the authority of the}} USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 to conduct searches of once-confidential library databases, Krug raised a public outcry against this government action. When shortly after the September 11 attacks a Florida librarian told police that one of the attackers had been using the Delray Beach public libraryalthough Florida law guarantees <b>confidentiality</b> to library patronsKrug criticized the action. She stated she wished the librarian had adhered to Florida law, but empathized with the situation and said that most individuals would likely have done the same thing.|$|E
5|$|Netcraft Site Report – {{indicates}} {{whether a}} website's <b>confidentiality</b> could be jeopardized {{due to a}} past exploitation of Heartbleed by checking data from Netcraft's SSL Survey {{to determine whether a}} site offered the heartbeat TLS Extension prior to the Heartbleed disclosure. The Netcraft Extensions for Chrome, Firefox and Opera also perform this check, whilst looking for potentially compromised certificates.|$|E
5|$|The case {{first went}} to the High Court of Justice, where it was heard by Fulford J; {{he decided that he}} did not have the {{authority}} to overrule Bonnard, and passed the case on to the Court of Appeal after granting a temporary injunction. In the Court of Appeal, the case was heard by May, Dyson and Brooke LJJ, with Brooke delivering the judgment on 5 November 2004. In it, Brooke judged that defamation, the subject of Greene, was significantly different from breach of <b>confidentiality,</b> the subject in Cream. While the damage from a breach of <b>confidentiality</b> can never be undone, justifiying a simple test for issuing injunctions, a defamation case that is won vindicates the injured party. Making it easier to grant injunctions in defamation cases would damage the delicate balance between freedom of the press and the right to privacy; as such, despite the Human Rights Act, Bonnard is still a valid test.|$|E
5|$|Two {{lawsuits}} {{were filed}} against Adi Da {{and the church}} in California in 1985. The O'Mahoney suit was dismissed the next year. The other lawsuit and several threatened suits in subsequent years were settled with payments and <b>confidentiality</b> agreements, negatively impacting member morale and bleeding the organization financially.|$|E
5|$|Following District Judge Earnest Lau's {{ruling in}} the Odex v. Pacific Internet lawsuit, Koshy {{expressed}} {{his belief that}} SingNet might be in breach {{of the spirit of}} the Telecommunications Competition Code, which protects the <b>confidentiality</b> of subscribers' information and prohibits unauthorised release. Another lawyer interviewed by ZDNet, however, did not think that SingNet's actions were improper, and a spokesman for the Infocomm Development Authority announced that SingNet was found to be in compliance with the code. Andy Ho, another The Straits Times editor, expressed concern that private entities might use intellectual property laws invasively, thus precipitating a chilling effect on free speech; he called for privacy laws to be quickly enacted.|$|E
5|$|Former Financial Times {{journalist}} Duff McDonald, said McKinsey's <b>confidentiality</b> policy often {{prevents the}} public from becoming informed about the firm's work, except after it is exposed through lawsuits or investigations. 13,000 McKinsey documents were released {{as part of a}} lawsuit against Allstate, which showed that McKinsey recommended the company reduce payouts to insurance claimants by offering low settlements, delaying processing to wear out claimants through attrition, and fighting customers that protest in court. Allstate's profits doubled over ten years after adopting McKinsey's strategy, but it also led to lawsuits alleging they were cheating claimants out of legitimate insurance claims.|$|E
5|$|Former McKinsey senior executives, Rajat Gupta and Anil Kumar, {{were among}} those convicted in a {{government}} investigation into insider trading for sharing inside information with Galleon Group hedge fund owner Raj Rajaratnam. Though McKinsey was not accused of any wrongdoing, the convictions were embarrassing for the firm, since it prides itself for integrity and client <b>confidentiality.</b> Following the initial allegations McKinsey no longer maintains a relationship with either senior partner, though {{the manner in which}} it severed ties attracted controversy.|$|E
5|$|McKinsey & Company is a {{worldwide}} management consulting firm. It conducts {{qualitative and quantitative}} analysis in order to evaluate management decisions across {{the public and private}} sectors. According to The New York Times, it is considered the most prestigious management consultancy in the world. McKinsey publishes the McKinsey Quarterly since 1964, funds the McKinsey Global Institute research organization, publishes reports on management topics, and has authored many influential books on management. Its practices of <b>confidentiality,</b> influence on business practices, and corporate culture have experienced a polarizing reception.|$|E
5|$|She {{coordinated the}} effort against the Communications Decency Act of 1996, {{which was the}} first attempt by the United States Congress to {{introduce}} a form of censorship of speech on the Internet. Krug strongly opposed the notion that libraries should censor the material that they provide to patrons. She supported laws and policies protecting the <b>confidentiality</b> of library use records. When the United States Department of Justice used the authority of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 to conduct searches of what once were confidential library databases, Krug raised a public outcry against this activity by the government.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{positively}} received by critics. Jeffrey Rosen, who reviewed {{the book for}} The New York Times, {{was surprised by the}} author's departure from traditional civil libertarian views. Rosen pointed out that Lewis did not support absolute protection for journalists from breaking <b>confidentiality</b> with their anonymous sources, even in situations involving criminal acts. Nat Hentoff called the book an engrossing and accessible survey of the First Amendment. Kirkus Reviews considered the book an excellent chronological account of the First Amendment, subsequent legislation, and case law.|$|E
5|$|York City had {{identified}} a preferred {{site for a}} new stadium by April 2007, but were unable to disclose the location due to <b>confidentiality</b> clauses. Despite the club failing to formally identify a site {{by the end of}} 2007, financial penalties were not incurred, as the FSIF were satisfied with the progress made. However, McGill said plans with the preferred site had stalled by March 2008. City of York Council announced its commitment to building a community stadium in May 2008, which would be used by York City and the city's rugby league club, York City Knights.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of her visions is {{problematic}} since {{the main source}} of information on this topic is the condemnation trial transcript in which she defied customary courtroom procedure about a witness' oath and specifically refused to answer every question about her visions. She complained that a standard witness oath would conflict with an oath she had previously sworn to maintain <b>confidentiality</b> about meetings with her king. It remains unknown to what extent the surviving record may represent the fabrications of corrupt court officials or her own possible fabrications to protect state secrets. Some historians sidestep speculation about the visions by asserting that her belief in her calling is more relevant than questions about the visions' ultimate origin.|$|E
5|$|Details of the {{assassination}} attempt were allegedly known by the principal Jesuit of England, Father Henry Garnet. Although {{he was convicted of}} treason and sentenced to death, doubt has been cast on how much he really knew of the plot. As its existence was revealed to him through confession, Garnet was prevented from informing the authorities by the absolute <b>confidentiality</b> of the confessional. Although anti-Catholic legislation was introduced soon after the plot's discovery, many important and loyal Catholics retained high office during King James I's reign. The thwarting of the Gunpowder Plot was commemorated for many years afterwards by special sermons and other public events such as the ringing of church bells, which have evolved into the Bonfire Night of today.|$|E
5|$|Huntington's disease, {{particularly}} {{the application of}} the genetic test for the disease, has raised several ethical issues. The issues for genetic testing include defining how mature an individual should be before being considered eligible for testing, ensuring the <b>confidentiality</b> of results, and whether companies should be allowed to use test results for decisions on employment, life insurance or other financial matters. There was controversy when Charles Davenport proposed in 1910 that compulsory sterilization and immigration control be used for people with certain diseases, including HD, as part of the eugenics movement. In vitro fertilization has some issues regarding its use of embryos. Some HD research has ethical issues due to its use of animal testing and embryonic stem cells.|$|E
5|$|Senior partner Anil Kumar, {{described}} as Gupta's protégé, left the firm after the allegations in 2009 and {{pleaded guilty in}} January 2010. While he and other partners had been pitching McKinsey's consulting services to the Galleon Group, Kumar and Rajaratnam reached a private consulting agreement, violating McKinsey's policies on <b>confidentiality.</b> Gupta was convicted in June 2012 of four counts of conspiracy and securities fraud, and acquitted on two counts. In October 2011, he was arrested by the FBI on criminal charges of sharing insider information from these confidential board meetings with Rajaratnam. At least twice, Gupta used a McKinsey phone to call Rajaratnam and retained other perks — an office, assistant, and $6 million retirement salary that year — as a senior partner emeritus.|$|E
5|$|The Swinton {{house was}} {{constructed}} on Stage 16, while Stage 20 {{was used for}} Rouge City and other sets. Spielberg copied Kubrick's obsessively secretive approach to filmmaking by refusing to give the complete script to cast and crew, banning press from the set, and making actors sign <b>confidentiality</b> agreements. Social robotics expert Cynthia Breazeal served as technical consultant during production. Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law applied prosthetic makeup daily {{in an attempt to}} look shinier and robotic. Costume designer Bob Ringwood (Batman, Troy) studied pedestrians on the Las Vegas Strip for his influence on the Rouge City extras. Spielberg found post-production on A.I. difficult because he was simultaneously preparing to shoot Minority Report.|$|E
5|$|The {{appeal was}} heard and {{dismissed}} the following day, Thursday, 12 March 2015. As {{part of its}} legal argument, aside from raising safety concerns, Sauber also submitted that van der Garde's contract had been terminated by the team in February {{with the approval of}} the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)'s Contract Recognition Board in any event, and that van der Garde violated <b>confidentiality</b> clauses of the contract by discussing it with the media. Lawyers representing Ericsson and Nasr further argued that van der Garde had not followed due process by failing to give their clients prior notice of his legal action. The court upheld the previous orders to permit van der Garde to participate in the race and adjourned the hearing to the following day, Friday, 13 March 2015, to hear arguments on contempt of court proceedings launched by van der Garde's legal team against Sauber's team principal, Monisha Kaltenborn.|$|E
25|$|These {{two studies}} {{indicate}} that <b>confidentiality</b> can be somewhat of an illusion; once an emotional experience is socially shared, <b>confidentiality</b> may actually be {{the exception rather than}} the rule.|$|E
25|$|O'Connor {{rejected}} the FBI's argument that <b>confidentiality</b> can be presumed {{based on the}} fact that an informant is giving information to the FBI. Justice O'Connor also rejected most forms of categorical presumptions of <b>confidentiality</b> that the FBI often used, such as automatic <b>confidentiality</b> for the purposes of Exemption 7(D) for all documents that are collected for a criminal investigation (which is one of the categorical presumptions the FBI used in this specific case). Justice O'Connor sarcastically stated that, under the way the FBI declared the <b>confidentiality</b> of documents, the FBI would expect that every single one of its documents can be withheld or redacted and that it can use Exemption 7(D) for all of its documents.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Viggo Kristansen's prison {{psychologist}} {{was cleared}} of all charges, both by The Norwegian Psychological Association (NPF) and the Oslo county. For {{the charges of}} breach of <b>confidentiality,</b> NPF stated that psychologists {{have a duty to}} report cases of miscarrige of justice, even when it breaks <b>confidentiality.</b>|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, {{medical ethics}} has viewed {{the duty of}} <b>confidentiality</b> as a {{relatively}} non-negotiable tenet of medical practice.|$|E
25|$|The ethical {{principle}} of <b>confidentiality</b> requires that information shared by a client with a therapist {{in the course}} of treatment is not shared with others. This principle bolsters the therapeutic alliance, as it promotes an environment of trust. There are important exceptions to <b>confidentiality,</b> namely where it conflicts with the clinician's duty to warn or duty to protect. This includes instances of suicidal behavior or homicidal plans, child abuse, elder abuse and dependent adult abuse.|$|E
25|$|<b>Confidentiality</b> {{involves}} {{a set of}} rules or a promise that limits access or places restrictions on certain types of information.|$|E
25|$|This {{element of}} <b>confidentiality</b> must be {{essential}} to the full and satisfactory maintenance {{of the relation between}} the parties.|$|E

25|$|However, in 2003 in McKevitt v. Pallasch, Judge Posner {{reaffirmed the}} majority's opinion in Branzburg {{in a case}} {{concerning}} a refusal to stay an order, in a terrorism case in Ireland, to subpoena recordings of a key witness possessed {{by a group of}} journalists. Posner used the case-by-case balancing test envisioned by Justice Powell, writing: The federal interest in cooperating in the criminal proceedings of friendly foreign nations is obvious; and it is likewise obvious that newsgathering and reporting activities of the press are inhibited when a reporter cannot assure a confidential source of <b>confidentiality.</b> Yet that was Branzburg and it is evident from the result in that case that the interest of the press in maintaining the <b>confidentiality</b> of sources is not absolute. There is no conceivable interest in <b>confidentiality</b> in the present case.|$|E
