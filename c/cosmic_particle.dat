50|$|After {{the primary}} <b>cosmic</b> <b>particle</b> has {{collided}} with the air molecule, {{the main part of}} the first interactions are pions. Also kaons and baryons may be created. Pions and kaons are not stable, thus they may decay into other particles.|$|E
50|$|EMMA {{is focused}} on {{studying}} the composition of cosmic rays in the energy above 1 PeV-range, the so-called knee region. When a primary <b>cosmic</b> <b>particle</b> collides with the atmosphere, it decays into secondary cosmic particles creating an air shower (muons, electrons, hadrons). EMMA is able to determine the muon shower multiplicity, lateral distribution and direction of entry-measurements.|$|E

Actually, sounds produced by invisible or hidden sources can provide information about both the motion {{and the location of}} the sources. The cosmophone is a 3 D sound immersion installation designed to sonify invisible <b>cosmic</b> <b>particles,</b> using synthetic sounds eliciting physically relevant sensations. The design of the cosmophone as a sound and music interface has been described in [34, 35]. We will describe below how the moving sound model was used in this framework to generate sounds evoking the trajectories of <b>cosmic</b> <b>particles.</b>|$|R
40|$|Uncertainties of {{the model}} energy spectra of the most {{energetic}} secondary π± -mesons (and K± -mesons) are discussed. Computer simulations of the partial energy spectra of the atmospheric vertical muons induced by primary <b>cosmic</b> <b>particles</b> with various fixed energies in interval 102 − 107 GeV {{in terms of the}} VENUS 4. 12, DPMJET 2. 55, QGSJET II- 03 and SIBYLL 2. 3 models had been carried out with help of CORSIKA package. These partial spectra should be convoluted with the contemporary spectra of the primary <b>cosmic</b> <b>particles.</b> Results of simulations are compared with the contemporary atmospheric vertical muon flux data. Comparison shows that all models underestimate production of secondary π± -mesons (and K± -mesons) by factor of ∼ 2 at the most high energies. This underestimation induces more rapid development of extensive air showers in the atmosphere and results in uncertainties in estimates of energy and composition of the primary <b>cosmic</b> <b>particles...</b>|$|R

During 1939-1942, Bose and Choudhuri exposed Ilford half-tone photographic plates in the high altitude mountainous regions of Darjeeling, and observed long curved ionizing tracks {{that appeared to be}} different from the tracks of alpha particles or protons. In a series of articles published in Nature, they identified a <b>cosmic</b> <b>particle</b> having an average mass close to 200 times the mass of electron. Their research came to an end when Choudhuri left India in 1945 to work with Patrick Blackett in England.|$|E
50|$|In {{cosmology}} and physics, cold {{dark matter}} (CDM) is a hypothetical form of dark matter whose particles moved slowly compared to {{the speed of light}} (the cold in CDM) since the universe was approximately one year old (a time when the <b>cosmic</b> <b>particle</b> horizon contained the mass of one typical galaxy); and interact very weakly with ordinary matter and electromagnetic radiation (the dark in CDM). It is believed that approximately 84.54% of matter in the Universe is dark matter, with only a small fraction being the ordinary baryonic matter that composes stars, planets and living organisms.|$|E

5000|$|Plasmas {{and their}} {{embedded}} magnetic fields affect the formation, evolution and destiny of planets and planetary systems. The heliosphere shields {{the solar system}} from galactic cosmic radiation. Our habitable planet is shielded by its magnetic field, protecting it from solar and <b>cosmic</b> <b>particle</b> radiation and from erosion of the atmosphere by the solar wind. Planets without a shielding magnetic field, such as Mars and Venus, are exposed to those processes and evolve differently. And on Earth, the magnetic field changes strength and configuration during its occasional polarity reversals, altering the shielding of the planet from external radiation sources.|$|E
50|$|CTA {{will look}} at the sky in higher energy photons than ever {{measured}} before. In fact, the <b>cosmic</b> <b>particle</b> accelerators CTA will probe can reach energies inaccessible to man-made accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider. CTA’s unique capabilities will help us to address some of the most perplexing questions in astrophysics. CTA will seek to understand the impact of high-energy particles in the evolution of cosmic systems and to gain insight into the most extreme and unusual phenomena in the Universe. CTA will search for annihilating dark matter particles and deviations from Einstein’s theory of special relativity and even conduct a census of particle acceleration in the Universe.|$|E
50|$|The Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) is a NASA Explorers program Mission of Opportunity {{dedicated}} {{to the study of}} the extraordinary gravitational, electromagnetic, and nuclear physics environments embodied by neutron stars, exploring the exotic states of matter where density and pressure are higher than in atomic nuclei. NICER will enable rotation-resolved spectroscopy of the thermal and non-thermal emissions of neutron stars in the soft (0.2-12 keV) X-ray band with unprecedented sensitivity, probing interior structure, the origins of dynamic phenomena, and the mechanisms that underlie the most powerful <b>cosmic</b> <b>particle</b> accelerators known. NICER will achieve these goals by deploying, following launch, an X-ray timing and spectroscopy instrument as an attached payload aboard the International Space Station (ISS).

The nature of the primary <b>cosmic</b> <b>particles,</b> the mechanism of the cosmic acceleration and their locations are totally unknown.

50|$|While {{some of the}} {{energetic}} beta particles followed the Earth's magnetic field and illuminated the sky, other high-energy electrons became trapped and formed radiation belts around the earth. There was much uncertainty and debate about the composition, magnitude and potential adverse effects from this trapped radiation after the detonation. The weaponeers became quite worried when three satellites in low Earth orbit were disabled. The half-life of {{the energetic}} electrons {{was only a few}} days. At the time it was not known that solar and <b>cosmic</b> <b>particle</b> fluxes varied by a factor 10, and energies could exceed 1 MeV. These man-made radiation belts eventually crippled one-third of all satellites in low Earth orbit. Seven satellites failed over the months following the test, as radiation damaged their solar arrays or electronics, including the first commercial relay communication satellite, Telstar, as well as the United Kingdom's first satellite, Ariel 1. Detectors on Telstar, TRAAC, Injun, and Ariel 1 were used to measure distribution of the radiation produced by the tests.|$|E

The data obtained reveal a latitude dependence of the frequency of observed flashes. This distribution of flashes is correlated with the distribution of <b>cosmic</b> <b>particles</b> with stopping power greater than 15 keV/ micrometers in the eye.

40|$|Knowledge of the phase, structure, and {{crystallography}} of <b>cosmic</b> <b>particles,</b> as well {{as their}} elemental and isotopic compositions, would be very valuable information toward understanding the nature of our solar system. This information can be obtained from the intact capture of large mineral grains of <b>cosmic</b> <b>particles</b> from hypervelocity impacts. Hypervelocity experiments of intact capture in underdense media have indicated realistic potential in this endeaver. The recovery of the thermal blankets and louvers from the Solar Max spacecraft have independently verified this potential in the unintended capture of cosmic materials from hypervelocity impacts. Passive underdense media will permit relatively simple and inexpensive missions to capture <b>cosmic</b> <b>particles</b> intact, either by going to a planetary body or by waiting for the particles to come to the Shuttle or the Space Station. Experiments to explore the potential of using various underdense media for an intact comet sample capture up to 6. 7 km/s were performed at NASA Ames Research Center Vertical Gun Range. Explorative hypervelocity experiments up to 7. 9 km/s were also made at the Ernst Mach Institute. These experiments have proven that capturing intact particles at hypervelocity impacts is definitely possible. Further research is being conducted to achieve higher capture ratios at even higher hypervelocities for even smaller projectiles...|$|R
40|$|Ground-based gamma-ray {{astronomy}} {{has experienced}} a major breakthrough {{in the last decade}} thanks to the advent of new generation instruments such as H. E. S.
