40|$|Legal systems {{around the}} world vary widely in how they deal with the {{assignment}} of receivables. This legal variety {{makes it difficult for}} financiers to conduct their international receivables financing business. This thesis suggests an International Registration System for the Assignment and Security Interest of Receivables (‘IRSAR’) and proposes a model international convention for the IRSAR (‘proposed IRSAR Convention’), which could help financiers to overcome the obstacles they currently encounter. Under the proposed IRSAR Convention, the international assignment of receivables would be regulated by a unified legal system with respect to priority and perfection. The IRSAR would facilitate international project financing. Furthermore, the IRSAR would enable companies to raise finance from greater ranges of investors {{around the world}} through international receivables financing and to dispose of non-performing loans more easily. The proposed IRSAR Convention would succeed the UN Convention on the Assignment of Receivables in International Trade in the attempt of establishing a registration system for international assignments of receivables. The proposed IRSAR Convention confines its scope of application by defining the assignor (or the security provider), inventing the concept of ‘Vehicle for the International Registration System’ (‘VIRS’). The proposed IRSAR Convention applies where the assignor or security provider is a VIRS. An assignment of a receivable where the assignor is a VIRS and a security interest in a receivable where the security provider is a VIRS could be registered in the IRSAR. Under the proposed IRSAR <b>Convention,</b> <b>priority</b> of assignments of and security interests in receivables is determined by the order of registration in the IRSAR. The proposed IRSAR Convention would be a receivables version of the Cape Town Convention. With respect to the contents and effect of registration, it would prescribe a notice-filing system along the lines of that adopted in the UCC Article 9. With respect to the operation of the registration, it would adopt an automatic online registration system operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year like the International Registry under the Cape Town Convention.

40|$|The aim of my master`s thesis was to {{approach}} the issue of working hours {{as one of the}} most important working conditions, and its special arrangements known as flexible working hours account. The basis of working hours is contained the Labour Code 262 / 2006. Working hours are often decisive factor for selecting employment. Mothers welcome the opportunity to negotiate a shorter working time. They can properly take care of their children as well as go to work. Today is very popular flexible working hours. The thesis is devoted to working hours, both at an international and European level. These regulations have a considerable influence on the Czech regulation of working time. ILO <b>conventions</b> have <b>priority</b> over the Czech law. From the 1 st May 2004 is the Czech Republic member of the European Union and it implies an obligation to bring Czech legal regulation into conformity with European Union regulation. For regulation of working hours are important judgements of the European Court of Justice. The most important judgements are mentioned in the thesis (e. g. Jaeger, SIMAP). These judgements had big influence on definitions of working hours in Labour Codes of the Member States. Czech Labour Code respects these decisions as well as the Council Directive 2003 / 88 /EC on some aspects of organization of the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFinancialisation {{and housing}} are {{predominantly}} associated to mortgages for homeownership and securitisation techniques. This paper looks at how financial markets influence the development industry, its business strategies, {{and the nature}} and location of its products. Adopting a supply-side account, the paper inquires into the rising role of financial markets {{as a source of}} funding for a consolidating development industry and its influence on the geography of housing in Brazilian cities. It develops the concept of resonance by combining two yet unrelated strands of literature on the study of financial markets (cultural economy and conventionalist economics). Narratives co-authored by the stock market community and development firms management over each individual firm, and the discursively linked strategic moves of developers, are shown to resonate, at the meso-level of the industry, into shared social representations (or conventions) on how to best assess and interpret the value of development firms. Analysing the wave of Initial Public Offerings occurring in the mid 2000 s, the paper highlights that narratives of quick capital gains associated with the removal of the land banking bottleneck faced by developers supported a <b>convention</b> giving <b>priority</b> to the growth in total output, and contributed to the observed changes in the forms, scales and locations of housing projects in Brazilian cities. As discrepancies between the promises of returns for shareholders and actual financial results emerged, the growth convention unravelled, making way for other narratives and strategic moves to resonate anew and possibly change again the geographies of housin...|$|R

After making initial recommendations for administrative changes, {{over the next few}} months he helped to organise, and actually took part in Gálvez' successful siege of Pensacola, the key British base in Florida. On his return he found that his recommendations had been accepted by the Spanish government, and key officials had been replaced. In July, at the request of the Minister (José de Gálvez, Bernardo's uncle), Saavedra, who spoke and wrote French fluently, met in the French colony of St. Domingue with Admiral de Grasse to discuss the best ways of using the large French fleet he had brought across the Atlantic, and they agreed a plan for the following year, known as the Grasse-Saavedra <b>Convention.</b> First <b>priority</b> was to aid the French and American forces in the United States, preferably by attacking the British force in Virginia under Lord Cornwallis. Next was to regain control of Caribbean islands captured by the British. The final goal of the plan was the capture of Jamaica, by far the richest British possession in the West Indies. To finance phase 1, Saavedra obtained 100,000 pesos from the Spanish treasury in neighboring Santo Domingo. The Spanish had planned to finance the French and North Americans with pesos shipped through Veracruz from the mines in Mexico. The ships had not arrived, and then, finding that most of the Government money from Havana had been sent on to Spain, he appealed to Cuban citizens, who raised a further 500,000 pesos in a matter of hours.|$|R
40|$|Despite humanity's {{considerable}} {{efforts to}} stop it child labour remains a global problem. In the international context child labour means the labour of persons younger than 15 years. Despite all {{the activities of the}} International Labour Organization (ILO), UN, European Community, UNICEF and other international and national institutions child labour was not completely swept away. Efforts to abolish child labour date back to 1919 when the first meeting of the International Labour Conference was held where, similarly to the following two meetings, convention concerning minimum age for admission to employment were adopted. Its content has been gradually revised and it has eventually been replaced by Convention No. 138 which was included among the ILO's eight <b>priority</b> <b>conventions.</b> Nevertheless {{it is not possible to}} argue that child labour is the problem exclusive to the "third world" countries. Although the Labour Code prohibits labour of children under 15 years of age, we can encounter children performing in theatres, films, commercials, modelling, earning extra money at gas stations or distributing leaflets on a daily basis in Czech Republic. These are all activities on which children spend many hours, they do a lot of work and they often earn a considerable amount of money. In many cases we can see [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{show how}} to provide a time queue, which is a variant of a prior-ity queue, for two {{different}} processes. One process has time constraints and may only spend constant worst case time on each operation. Itonly {{has to be able}} to perform some of the time queue operations while the other process {{has to be able to}} perform all operations. The otherprocess do not have any time constraints but we provide its operation in expected constant time. The main contribution is to show how to de-amortize the deleteMincost and providing mutual exclusion for the parts that both processes maintains. 1 Introduction In this paper we will look at a special variant of the Priority Queue problem which we call the Time Queue problem. A time queue is a queue in which we store elements together with a time stamp. Elements are processed in order of their time stamps. Newly inserted elements must have a time stamp which lies in the future. The time queue can be used in various ways. One task may be as a time-out manager, where an element has to be processed before some given time otherwise it should be considered to have timed-out and handled specially. The time queue can also be used for the simulation event set problem [3] and other scheduling problems. The time queue supports, given a set N of N elements, the ordinary operations of a priority queue, insert, min and deleteMin. By <b>convention</b> the highest <b>priority</b> has the lowest numerical value, hence min. We will refer to the element with the minimum numerical priority value as the min element and use t 0 to denote its priority...|$|R
40|$|This work {{examines}} {{security interests}} under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment. The {{main purpose of}} the Convention {{is to provide a}} uniform legal regime for the creation, registration and protection of a creditor’s interests held in high value types of mobile equipment, such as aircraft, railway and space objects. The Convention provides for the creation of an autonomous international interest in these types of equipment and establishes an electronic International Registry for recordation of interests in aircraft objects. The international interests are supported by an elaborate system of remedies exercisable {{in the case of the}} debtor’s default or insolvency. These features of the Convention are aimed at promoting predictability and transparency in the financing of mobile equipment which should reduce the risks and costs of borrowing to the benefit of all stake holders. The work examines such issues as the problems of the definition and creation of security interests as well as the possibility of the creation of a floating security under the Convention. It also explores the aims and assesses the effectiveness of the registration system established under the Convention. Next, the thesis examines the rules of the <b>Convention</b> on setting <b>priorities</b> between competing creditors. Finally, the work explored the remedies (and their effectiveness) available to the creditor. One of the aims of this work is to examine the provisions of the Convention and to test whether the legal regime created by it can operate successfully and help facilitate financing of high value equipment. In order to test the effectiveness of the Convention, its provisions will be evaluated in the context of various factual scenarios, which, considering the absence of cases under the Convention, were largely inspired by the experience of some major domestic jurisdictions, such as the UK and the US. This exercise may also shed some light on strengths and weaknesses of the Convention in comparison with these systems. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{constitutional}} change {{debate has}} shifted ground, according to John Warhurst THE BIG constitutional questions about structural and systemic {{change in the}} political system don’t go away. They include political representation issues such as the possible introduction of citizen-initiated referendums and a bill of rights. The notable thing is that discussions are occurring more frequently now at the state rather than the national level. The impetus for constitutional reform has switched to the states. Commonwealth discussion has been stalled by a number of factors. These include the recent record of failure in constitutional referendums and the apparent lack of interest of the Howard Government in such matters. The switch of emphasis is entirely in keeping with our federal system. Numerically the eight state and territory jurisdictions should generate more action than the Commonwealth level. There has always been much unheralded change at the state level. But it rarely gets national coverage because our mass media doesn’t work that way. The ACT is one of the jurisdictions leading the way, with three important reforms under consideration. The first is the proposal to examine the size of the Legislative Assembly. After the deliberations of the parliamentary committee and the taking of public evidence it appears that the major parties are going to recommend an increase from 17 to 23 members divided into four electorates. The second is the reactivation by Gary Humphries, the Leader of the Opposition, of a proposal for citizen-initiated referendums in the form of his Community Referendum Bill 2002. Over the past beginning with Kate Carnell’s proposal in 1994, the ACT has been in the vanguard of this innovation. The third is the public consultation at the instigation of the Chief Minister, Jon Stanhope, into the idea of a Bill of Rights for the ACT. A committee, chaired by Professor Hilary Charlesworth of the Faculty of Law at the ANU, has produced an issues paper and is receiving submissions and conducting public hearings until the end of September. These initiatives are proceeding independently of one another using a number of mechanisms. That may be the way to go because it offers the prospect of incremental change. But a different approach is being taken in South Australia. SA is choosing the big-bang approach. There, discussion of the big questions has been generated {{by the fact that the}} Rann Labor government is a minority government kept in office under a compact with the Speaker, Peter Lewis, an independent who was formerly a Liberal. Lewis is a controversial figure in SA at the moment because of his peremptory style, his electoral problems and his commercial dealings. He has an ambitious plan for constitutional and political system change which he spelt out at the time of the last state election and which he is now trying to bring to fruition. This was the context for a conference last month in Adelaide on “Constitutional and Parliamentary Reform for South Australia”, in which I took part. Gary Humphries was one of those who presented proposals for consideration. The conference addressed a wide range of issues. In fact, by general agreement, too much was attempted. The issues included the role of just about every possible institution, including the Parliament, the Speaker, the Governor, and the electoral system but in particular CIRs and the size of parliament. Rann announced that Cabinet had approved 570, 000 for a Constitutional Convention to be held in March or April 2003. But Lewis publicly concluded that the budget would need to be 2 million to hold at least three separate <b>conventions.</b> The first <b>priority</b> would be CIRs and the second would be the size and role of Parliament. The drive for constitutional renovation lies in evidence of citizen dissatisfaction. Therefore citizens need to be consulted somehow. But to do so needs time and money and leadership. Citizens may want to be consulted but they may not want to pay for the privilege. The leaders need to behave diplomatically. It is leadership disguised as “followership”. Constitutional reform should proceed slowly and in a piecemeal fashion. On balance I prefer the ACT way. While the idea of an ACT constitutional convention is attractive, there is no evidence that it is a more efficient way of approaching reform. But the SA approach has one great strength. It provides a focus and a sense of excitement. The SA conference heard about the South African experience of writing a new constitution. What distinguishes this successful experiment from Australian failures is community involvement and attachment to the process. Having everything on the table at once does generate excitement. And excitement is a necessary ingredient. What is happening in the ACT and SA at the moment demonstrates a number of things. Constitutional change is on the agenda. The questions won 2 ̆ 7 t go away. In particular, more and more people are driven by their dissatisfaction with the limitations of the present system to entertain proposals, like CIRs and bills of rights, that are stretching the existing arrangements. People are continuing to think outside the square.
