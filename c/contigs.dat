A <b>contig</b> is a set of gel readings that are related to one another by overlap of their sequences. All gel readings belong to one and only one <b>contig,</b> and each <b>contig</b> contains at least one gel reading.

5|$|DNA {{sequence}} {{data from}} genomic and metagenomic projects are essentially the same, but genomic sequence data offers higher coverage while metagenomic data is usually highly non-redundant. Furthermore, {{the increased use}} of second-generation sequencing technologies with short read lengths means that much of future metagenomic data will be error-prone. Taken in combination, these factors make the assembly of metagenomic sequence reads into genomes difficult and unreliable. Misassemblies are caused by the presence of repetitive DNA sequences that make assembly especially difficult because of the difference in the relative abundance of species present in the sample. Misassemblies can also involve the combination of sequences from more than one species into chimeric <b>contigs.</b>|$|E
25|$|For the PacBio platform, too, {{depending}} on what methylation you expect to find, coverage needs can vary. As of March 2017, other epigenetic factors like histone modifications have not been discoverable using third-generation technologies. Longer patterns of methylation are often lost because smaller <b>contigs</b> {{still need to be}} assembled.|$|E
25|$|The {{alternative}} is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent {{more than two or}} three repeat units appearing in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely de novo identification or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from <b>contigs</b> (overlapping DNA segments that together represent a consensus region of DNA) and direct repeat sequences from published genomes as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.|$|E

As sequencing projects ramped up in the 1990s, and projects approached completion, low coverage approximations became inadequate, and the exact model of Roach was necessary.

40|$|The bovine RPCI- 42 BAC {{library was}} {{screened}} {{to construct a}} sequence-ready ~ 4 Mb single <b>contig</b> of 92 BAC clones on BTA 1 q 12. The <b>contig</b> covers the region between the genes KRTAP 8 P 1 and CLIC 6. This genomic segment in cattle is of special interest as it contains the dominant gene responsible for the hornless or polled phenotype in cattle. The construction of the BAC <b>contig</b> was initiated by screening the bovine BAC library with heterologous cDNA probes derived from 12 human genes of the syntenic region on HSA 21 q 22. <b>Contig</b> building was facilitated by BAC end sequencing and chromosome walking. During {{the construction of the}} <b>contig,</b> 165 BAC end sequences and 109 single-copy STS markers were generated. For comparative mapping of 25 HSA 21 q 22 genes, genomic PCR primers were designed from bovine EST sequences and the gene-associated STSs mapped on the <b>contig.</b> Furthermore, bovine BAC end sequence comparisons against the human genome sequence revealed significant matches to HSA 21 q 22 and allowed the in silico mapping of two new genes in cattle. In total, 31 orthologues of human genes located on HSA 21 q 22 were directly mapped within the bovine BAC <b>contig,</b> of which 16 genes have been cloned and mapped {{for the first time in}} cattle.
