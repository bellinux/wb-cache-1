5|$|A {{wide variety}} of AAC systems have been used with {{children}} with developmental verbal dyspraxia. Manual signs or gestures are frequent introduced to these children, and can {{include the use of}} fingerspelling alongside speech. Manual signs have been shown to decrease errors in articulation. Aided AAC systems typically include communication boards and speech generating devices. A multimodal approach is often used, with several AAC approaches introduced so that the <b>child</b> <b>can</b> take advantage of the most effective method for a particular situation.|$|E

5|$|Beside {{being the}} capital city of Sarawak, Kuching became a {{business}} and cultural centre for the Malays of Sarawak. The dialect of Malay spoken in Kuching is known as Bahasa Sarawak (Sarawakian Malay Language), which is a subset of the Malay language. The dialect used in Kuching is a little different from the dialect used in Miri. Since the second largest population in the city is made up of Han Chinese, the Chinese language is also commonly used, particularly Hokkien, Hakka and Mandarin Chinese. Almost all residents are able to speak English. A number of special private schools that teach English for expatriates <b>child</b> <b>can</b> be found through the city.|$|E
5|$|There are {{questions}} about the external validity of the AS diagnosis. That is, {{it is unclear whether}} there is a practical benefit in distinguishing AS from HFA and from PDD-NOS; the same <b>child</b> <b>can</b> receive different diagnoses depending on the screening tool. The debate about distinguishing AS from HFA is partly due to a tautological dilemma where disorders are defined based on severity of impairment, so that studies that appear to confirm differences based on severity are to be expected.|$|E

25|$|When a {{hand loom}} {{was located in}} the home, {{children}} helped with the weaving process from an early age. Piecing needs dexterity, and a <b>child</b> <b>can</b> be as productive as an adult. When weaving moves from the home to the mill, children are often allowed to help their older sisters, and laws {{have to be made}} to prevent child labour becoming established.|$|E
30|$|The main {{difference}} between the highest years {{of education and the}} lowest years of education is that parents <b>can</b> decide which <b>child</b> should drop out of school; they cannot decide if their <b>children</b> <b>can</b> complete the full 9  years of compulsory education or whether <b>children</b> <b>can</b> attend either high school or university.|$|R

25|$|A {{child who}} is {{disrupted}} is usually put first into foster care, pending placement with a new family, unless they reach the age of 18 and legally become adults before this happens.

25|$|This normal, human embryologic {{development}} is exceptionally important—because the newborn infant breathes through {{his or her}} nose during the first 6 weeks of life—thus, {{when a child is}} afflicted with bilateral choanal atresia, the blockage of the posterior nasal passage, either by abnormal bony tissue or by abnormal soft tissue, emergency remedial action is required to ensure that the <b>child</b> <b>can</b> breathe.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present Quilt Snaps, a fabric based {{construction}} kit {{consisting of a}} set of computationally enhanced quilting pieces. Our discussion focuses on three ways that <b>children</b> <b>can</b> engage with Quilt Snaps. First, Quilt Snaps allows children to act as the engineers, designers, and decorators of their own digital manipulatives. Second, by playing with the manipulatives that they’ve helped to construct, <b>children</b> <b>can</b> learn about concepts relevant to programming, graph theory, and dynamical systems. Finally, since Quilt Snaps is fabric based, <b>children</b> <b>can</b> use the pieces they construct as personal mobile display media. 1...|$|R

25|$|Historically, ABO {{blood tests}} {{were used in}} {{paternity}} testing, but in 1957 only 50% of American men falsely accused {{were able to use}} them as evidence against paternity. Occasionally, the blood types of children are not consistent with expectations—for example, a type O <b>child</b> <b>can</b> be born to an AB parent—due to rare situations, such as Bombay phenotype and cis AB.|$|E
