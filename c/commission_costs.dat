50|$|This {{combination}} of factors has made day trading in stocks and stock derivatives (such as ETFs) possible. The low commission rates allow an individual or small firm to make {{a large number of}} trades during a single day. The liquidity and small spreads provided by ECNs allow an individual to make near-instantaneous trades and to get favorable pricing. High-volume issues such as Intel or Microsoft generally have a spread of only $0.01, so the price only needs to move a few pennies for the trader to cover his <b>commission</b> <b>costs</b> and show a profit.|$|E

25|$|Because ETFs {{trade on}} an exchange, each {{transaction}} is generally {{subject to a}} brokerage commission. Commissions depend on the brokerage and which plan is chosen by the customer. For example, a typical flat fee schedule from an online brokerage firm in the United States ranges from $10 to $20, {{but it can be}} as low as $0 with discount brokers. Due to this <b>commission</b> <b>cost,</b> the amount invested has a great bearing; someone who wishes to invest $100 per month may have a significant percentage of their investment destroyed immediately, while for someone making a $200,000 investment, the <b>commission</b> <b>cost</b> may be negligible. Generally, mutual funds obtained directly from the fund company itself do not charge a brokerage fee. Thus, when low or no-cost transactions are available, ETFs become very competitive.|$|R

5000|$|An {{arbitrage}} operation may {{be represented}} as a sequence which begins with zero balance in an account, initiates transactions at time t = 0, and unwinds transactions at time t = T so that all that remains at the end is a balance whose value B will be known for certain {{at the beginning of}} the sequence. If there were no transaction costs then a non-zero value for B would allow an arbitrageur to profit by following the sequence either as it stands if the present value of B is positive, or with all transactions reversed if the present value of B is negative. However, market forces tend to close any arbitrage windows which might open; hence the present value of B is usually insufficiently different from zero for transaction costs to be covered.

40|$|While a {{large number}} of studies have been {{reported}} in the literature with reference to the use of Regression model and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models in predicting stock prices in western countries, the Chinese stock market is much less studied. Note that the latter is growing rapidly, will overtake USA one in 20 - 30 years time and thus be-comes a very important place for investors worldwide. In this paper, an attempt is made at predicting the Shanghai Composite Index returns and price volatility, on a daily and weekly basis. In the paper, two different types of prediction models, namely the Regression and Neural Network models are used for the prediction task and multiple technical indicators are included in the models as inputs. The performances of the two models are compared and evaluated in terms of di- rectional accuracy. Their performances are also rigorously compared in terms of economic criteria like annualized return rate (ARR) from simulated trading. In this paper, both trading with and without short selling has been consid- ered, and the results show in most cases, trading with short selling leads to higher profits.
