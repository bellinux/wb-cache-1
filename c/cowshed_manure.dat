40|$|The {{quality of}} {{potatoes}} in stony soils {{can be improved}} by the soil separation technique. If this technique is used in autumn in combination with integrated catch-crop growing and fertilization of stable manure or slurry a higher yield was observed, but also a lower leaching rate of nitrate over the winter period. This was tested in field trials under organic farming conditions in 1999 and 2000 on the experimental farm Lindhof of the University of Kiel. Catch crops as oil radish or yellow mustard were able to fix 60 - 70 kg Nt ha- 1. Tuber yield after oil radish (36. 4 t ha- 1) was higher than after yellow mustard (33. 0 t ha- 1) and was significantly higher compared to the control (30. 3 t ha- 1). <b>Cowshed</b> <b>manure</b> (80 kg Nt ha- 1) or slurry (40 kg Nt ha- 1) increased yield in a similar range as catch crops. The highest yield (41. 7 t ha- 1) was recorded after oil radish combined with manuring of 40 kg Nt ha- 1 slurry. Also the nitrogen uptake by the tubers was highest after oil radish combined with slurry 87. 1 kg ha- 1 compared to 57, 7 kg ha- 1 in the control. The comparison of the soil separation technique in autumn {{in the year before}} or in spring just before planting the potatoes showed higher yield after the use in autumn...|$|E

40|$|In this work, the {{activities}} of hydrolytic enzymes, functioning in the hydrolytic stage of the production of biogas, have been determined. The activities of -amylase, -xylanase, and -glucosidase have been measured in five samples collected from the following steps of biogas production:. cow dung from the adjacent <b>cowshed,</b> cow <b>manure</b> from the homogenization tank for dosing biogas plant, digester sludge from the outside biogas fermenter, degister sludge from the inside biogas fermenter, and sludge of digestate from digestate tank. Samples for measurement of enzyme activities were provided by agricultural biogas station AGRI FAIR in Deštná, which uses for biogas production cow manure and corn silage The activities of hydrolytic enzymes {{in the production of}} biogas are crucial, because degradability of feed material is the limiting factor. Activity of a amylase had highest value in cow dung and cow manure due to food containing high levels of starch. In subsequent phases falls evenly. In the indoor digester and digestate is already depleted substrate and the activity is at zero level. Its activity is almost three times higher than - glycosidase in cow dung and cow manure, but in the last three stages of -glycosidase activity exceeds   amylase and its value is nearly stable. -xylanase has [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Raising {{cattle in}} cowsheds {{is proving to}} be a great success in the cotton growing zone of Senegal. The local textile fibre {{development}} company (Sodefitex) is encouraging this type of intensive livestock husbandry as one way the area can better face the combined pressures of unsettled climate, devaluation of the CFA franc, population and over-use of natural resources. <b>Manure</b> <b>cowsheds,</b> as they are known, are simply shelters having a pit and a feeding trough. In certain cases, the pit is cemented and in others, it is simply a hole dug in the ground. The animals receive a health check and surveillance (vermifuge and trypanocide treatments), are watered once a day, and fed on stalks from the bush and from maize. The major supplement given is cotton seed. The system is seen as a 'technology package' which results in organic manure for fertiliser and for producing biogas. The cowshed system is viable, {{according to a recent study}} conducted on twelve family small-holdings in villages around the town of Tambacounda. Sales of milk and the production of manure are well in excess of the costs of the health treatments and the cotton seed. Profits are even higher for farmers that have concreted cowsheds. Still, this system's success depends heavily on Sodefitex's cotton seed price subsidies. Even so, manure sheds help to conserve natural resources, which benefits rural people. For this reason alone this innovation deserves to be supported as an integral part of the cotton production chain, and it should help maintain productivity over the long term.

40|$|The {{objective}} was to compare automatic lameness detection methods based on daily automatic measurements of cow’s back posture and behavioral and performance variables. The experimental setup was located in a commercial Israeli dairy farm of 1, 100 Israeli Holstein cows. All cows were housed in open, roofed <b>cowsheds</b> with dried <b>manure</b> bedding and no stalls. All cows were equipped with a commercial neck activity and ruminating time data logger. Milk yield was measured with a milk flow sensor. Cow gait recordings were made during 4 consecutive nighttime milking sessions with a 3 D image camera. From the videos, the “inverse radius” of the back posture contour and the “back posture measurement” were extracted. The reference {{in this study was}} a daily live locomotion score of the animals. A dataset of 186 cows with 4 video-based lameness scores and 4 live locomotion scores was built. In total, 38 model input variables were constructed from the sensor data comprising absolute values, relative values, daily standard deviations, slope coefficients, daytime and nighttime periods and milk session related variables. Data of lame cows – cows recognized and treated for lameness – was compared with data of non-lame cows. A logistic regression model was built with the highest correlated behavioral and performance variables. Model validation was done with 10 -fold cross-validation. The analysis of the video-based scores as independent observations leads to a correct classification rate of 53. 0 % on a 5 -point level scale. A multinomial logistic regression model based on 4 consecutive “back posture measurement”-scores and “inverse radius”-scores obtained a correct classification rate of 60. 8 %. Strict binary classification to lame vs. not-lame categories reached 80. 7 % correct classification rate. In addition, the logistic regression model included 7 model input variables (the daily milk yield; the slope coefficient of the daily milk yield; the nighttime/daytime neck activity ratio; the milk yield week difference ratio; the milk yield week difference; the neck activity level during the daytime; the ruminating time during nighttime). After 10 -fold cross-validation, the model obtained a sensitivity of 0. 89 and a specificity of 0. 85, with a correct classification rate of 0. 86 when based on the averaged 10 -fold model coefficients. The combination of image processing and behavioral monitoring is believed to further improve the lameness detection accuracy.
