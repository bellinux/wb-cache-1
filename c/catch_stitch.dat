50|$|The hem {{stitches}} {{that are}} commonly used for hand-sewn hems include: pick stitch; <b>catch</b> <b>stitch</b> (also called a herringbone stitch); slip stitch; and blind stitch.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{techniques}} {{for creating a}} blind stitch by hand sewing. A common technique {{used to create a}} hem, or [...] "blind hem", hides the stitches {{on both sides of the}} garment. The sewer catches only a few threads of the fabric each time the needle is pulled through the fabric. Other techniques hide the stitch within the folds of the fabric, so that the thread is only visible when the folded material is pulled away. A slip stitch or <b>catch</b> <b>stitch</b> can be used to create the blind stitch, except that they are worked inside the hem, [...] away from the edge of the hem fabric.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the CHIP project is to demonstrate how Semantic Web technologies can be deployed to provide personalized access to digital museum collections. We illustrate our approach with the digital database ARIA of the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam. For the semantic enrichment of the Rijksmuseum ARIA database we collaborated with the <b>CATCH</b> <b>STITCH</b> project to produce mappings to Iconclass, and with the MultimediaN E-culture project to produce the RDF/OWL of the ARIA and Adlib databases. The main focus of CHIP is on exploring the potential of applying adaptation techniques to provide personalized experience for the museum visitors both on the Web site and in the museum...|$|E
5000|$|Buttonhole <b>stitches</b> <b>catch</b> a loop of {{the thread}} {{on the surface}} of the fabric and needle is {{returned}} to the back of the fabric at a right angle to the original start of the thread. The finished stitch in some ways resembles a letter [...] "L" [...] depending on the spacing of the stitches. For buttonholes the stitches are tightly packed together and for blanket edges they are more spaced out. The properties of this stitch make it ideal for preventing raveling of woven fabric.|$|R
6000|$|... "He seems, to me, quite isolated,--lonely as the desert,--yet {{never was}} a man more fitted to prize a man, could he find one to match his mood. He finds them, {{but only in the}} past. He sings, rather than talks. He pours upon you a kind of satirical, heroical, {{critical}} poem, with regular cadences, and generally catching up, near the beginning, some singular epithet, which serves as a refrain when his song is full, or with which, as with a knitting needle, he <b>catches</b> up the <b>stitches,</b> if he has chanced, now and then, to let fall a row.|$|R
5000|$|Chain <b>stitches</b> <b>catch</b> a loop of {{the thread}} {{on the surface}} of the fabric. In the {{simplest}} of the looped stitches, the chain stitch, the needle comes up from the back of the fabric and then the needle goes back into the same hole it came out of, pulling the loop of thread almost completely through to the back; but before the loop disappears, the needle come back up (a certain distance from the beginning stitch -the distance deciding the length of the stitch), passes through the loop and prevents it from being pulled completely to the back of the fabric. The needle then passes back to the back of the fabric through the second hole and begins the stitch again. Examples of chain stitches are: ...|$|R
5000|$|Lindsey finds Darla {{waiting for}} him at home and she weakly tells him that Drusilla is not {{returning}} to L.A.. He gives her a container of human blood; she stops feigning weakness and searches his briefcase while {{he is in the}} shower. Meanwhile, at the hotel Angel attempts to look up the Band of Blacknil but doesn't have much research material given that it all left along with Wesley. Angel then shows up at the office of his former employees uninvited and unwelcome, barely acknowledges his former friends and helps himself to a book. Cordelia refuses to let him take it and grabs it off him, but Angel grows cold and deadly and it is clear he is willing to use force to get the book back. Wesley rises from his wheelchair and tells Cordy to let Angel have the book so he can remove himself from the premises. She finally gives him the book and Angel leaves without a second thought. Cordelia vents about Angel until Wesley <b>catches</b> her attention: <b>stitches</b> from his healing gunshot wound have torn in the confrontation.|$|R
