50|$|Mini-TOSLINK is a {{standardized}} {{optical fiber connector}} smaller than the standard square TOSLINK connector commonly used in larger consumer audio equipment. The plug is almost {{the same size and}} shape as the ubiquitous 3.5 mm stereo minijack. Adapters are available to connect a full-size TOSLINK plug to a mini-TOSLINK socket. Combined 3.5 mm jack and mini-TOSLINK sockets exist which can accept a 3.5 mm jack or a mini-TOSLINK plug; mini-TOSLINK plugs are made 0.5 mm longer than electrical jack plugs so that the latter are too short to touch and damage the LED of <b>combined</b> <b>connectors.</b> Many laptop computer and portable digital audio equipment models, such as the Google Chromecast Audio device and Apple AirPort Express and iPod Hi-Fi, use these connectors that allow for the insertion of 3.5 mm analog (electrical) headphone output or microphone input or mini-TOSLINK digital (optical) output.|$|R

5000|$|There {{have been}} {{attempts}} to introduce <b>combined</b> audio/video <b>connectors</b> for direct signals, {{but in the}} analog realm none of these has ever become common, {{with the exception of}} Europe where the SCART connector is very successful. [...] For a time the 5-pin DIN connector was popular for bi-directional stereo connection between A/V equipment, but it has been entirely displaced on modern consumer devices. Though RF modulators inherently transmit combined A/V signals in video applications, they depend on broadcast television systems and RF connectors which are not universal worldwide; RF signals are also generally inferior to direct signals due to protocol conversion and the RF limitations of the three major analog TV systems (NTSC, PAL and SECAM).|$|R

50|$|Before HD {{television}} {{became a}} standard, nearly all TV sets, VCRs, and DVD players sold in Europe had SCART connectors, although these are sometimes supplemented by RCA and/or RF connectors. SCART-RCA adapters also exist, which usually allow input of composite video and stereo audio. Outside Europe, separate RCA connectors are usually used, supplemented by RF connectors for backward compatibility and simplicity. Although mini-DIN connectors {{are used for}} S-Video connections, composite video, component video, and analog audio (mono or stereo) all use RCA connectors unless the signals are sent via SCART. In the digital realm, however, <b>combined</b> A/V <b>connectors</b> are gaining ground; HDMI is commonly used today for consumer electronics, and DisplayPort, a potential competitor to HDMI, is often found on home computers and peripherals.|$|R

40|$|<b>Combining</b> {{component}} & <b>connector</b> architecture descriptionlanguageswithcomponentbehaviormodelinglanguages enables modeling great {{parts of}} software architectures platformindependently. Nontrivial systems typically contain components with programming language behavior descriptions {{to interface with}} APIs. These components tie the complete software architecture to a specific platform and thus hamper reuse. Previous work on software architecture reuse with multiple platforms either requires platform-specific handcrafting or the effort of explicit platform models. We present an automated approach to transform platform-independent, logical software architectures into architectures with platform-specific components. This approach introduces abstract components to the platform-independent architecture and refines the se with components specific to the target platform prior to code generation. Consequently, a single logical software architecture model can be reused with multiple target platforms, which increases architecture maturity and reduces the maintenance effort of multiple similar software architectures.

40|$|AbstractStrengthening of Reinforced Concrete (RC) beams is {{required}} due to design errors, deficient concrete production, bad execution processes, damage due to earthquake, accidents such as collisions, fire, explosions and situations involving {{changes in the}} functionality of the structure etc. Jacketing has been considered {{as one of the}} important methods for strengthening and repairing of RC beams. Jacketing of RC beams is done by enlarging the existing cross section with a new layer of concrete that is reinforced with both longitudinal and transverse reinforcement. In the present investigation, 10 beams of size 150 mm x 300 mm x 2100 mm are cast. 4 RC beams are prepared with smooth surface; on the other hand, 4 RC beams are prepared with chipped surface. Remaining two RC beams are considered as control beams. Eight RC beams have been jacketed using additional reinforcement for 60 mm thickness all-round. Four different methods have been employed for jacketing of RC beams. These methods include use of dowel connectors and micro-concrete, bonding agent and micro-concrete, combined use of dowel connectors, bonding agent and micro-concrete and use of only micro-concrete without dowel connectors and bonding agent, respectively. After 28 days of curing period and completion of jacketing process, these RC beams are tested under two point loading system. Measurements taken during testing were central displacement, failure load, and failure mode & crack patterns. Effectiveness of each type of jacketing methodology on smooth surface was compared with chipped surface for the RC beams. As an outcome of investigation, for smooth surface RC beam, superior performance was observed for the beam jacketed using <b>combined</b> dowel <b>connectors</b> and bonding agent with micro-concrete. For chipped surface RC beams, superior performance was observed for the beam jacketed using only micro-concrete and without use of dowel connectors and bonding agent...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Although all intracompartmental {{pressure}} (ICP) measurement, {{magnetic resonance}} imaging, and near-infrared spectroscopy {{seem to be}} useful in confirming the diagnosis of chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS), no standard diagnostic procedure is currently universally accepted. We reviewed systematically the relevant published evidence on diagnostic criteria commonly in use for CECS to address 3 main questions: (1) Is there a standard diagnostic method available? (2) What ICP threshold criteria {{should be used for}} diagnosing CECS? (3) What are the criteria and options for surgical management? Finally, we made statements on the strength of each diagnostic criterion of ICP based on a rigorous standardized process. DATA SOURCES: We searched for studies that investigated ICP measurements in diagnosing CECS in the leg of human subjects, using PubMed, Score, PEDRO, Cochrane, Scopus, SportDiscus, Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar. Initial searches were performed using the phrase, "chronic exertional compartment syndrome. " The phrase "compartment syndrome" was then <b>combined,</b> using Boolean <b>connectors</b> ("OR" and "AND") with the words "diagnosis," "parameters," "levels," "localisation," or "measurement. " Data extracted from each study included study design, number of subjects, number of controls, ICP instrument used, compartments measured, limb position during measurements, catheter position, exercise protocol, timing of measurements, mean resting compartment pressures, mean maximal compartment pressures, mean postexercise compartment pressures, diagnostic criteria used, and whether a reference diagnostic standard was used. The quality of studies was assessed based on the approach used by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons in judging the quality of diagnostic studies, and recommendations were made regarding each ICP diagnostic criteria in the literature by taking into account {{the quality and quantity of}} the available studies proposing each criterion. MAIN RESULTS: In the review, 32 studies were included. The studies varied in the ICP measurement techniques used; the most commonly measured compartment was the anterior muscle compartment, and the exercise protocol varied between running, walking, and ankle plantarflexion and dorsiflexion exercises. Preexercise, mean values ranged from 7. 4 to 50. 8 mm Hg for CECS patients, and 5. 7 to 12 mm Hg in controls; measurements during exercise showed mean pressure readings ranging from 42 to 150 mm Hg in patients and 28 to 141 mm Hg in controls. No overlap between subjects and controls in mean ICP measurements was found at the 1 -minute postexercise timing interval only showing values ranging from 34 to 55. 4 mm Hg and 9 to 19 mm Hg in CECS patients and controls, respectively. The quality of the studies was generally not high, and we found the evidence for commonly used ICP criteria in diagnosing CECS to be weak. CONCLUSIONS: Studies in which an independent, blinded comparison is made with a valid reference standard among consecutive patients are yet to be undertaken. There should also be an agreed ICP test protocol for diagnosing CECS because the variability here contributes to the large differences in ICP measurements and hence diagnostic thresholds between studies. Current ICP pressure criteria for CECS diagnosis are therefore unreliable, and emphasis should remain on good history. However, clinicians may consider measurements taken at 1 minute after exercise because mean levels at this timing interval only did not overlap between subjects and controls in the studies we analyzed. Levels above the highest reported value for controls here (27. 5 mm Hg) along with a good history, should be regarded as highly suggestive of CECS. It is evident that to achieve an objective recommendation for ICP threshold there is a need to set up a multi-center study group to reach an agreed testing protocol and modify the preliminary recommendations we have made...|$|R
