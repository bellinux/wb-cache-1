He was called by Robb to testify against Oppenheimer, and shortly before he appeared Robb showed Teller a dossier of items unfavorable to Oppenheimer. Teller testified that he considered Oppenheimer loyal, but that [...] "in {{a great number of}} <b>cases,</b> <b>I</b> have seen Dr. Oppenheimer act – I understand that Dr. Oppenheimer acted – in a way which for me was exceedingly hard to understand. I thoroughly disagreed with him in numerous issues and his actions frankly appeared to me confused and complicated. To this extent I feel that I {{would like to see the}} vital interests of this country in hands which I understand better, and therefore trust more." [...] Asked whether Oppenheimer should be granted a security clearance, Teller said that [...] "if it is a question of wisdom or judgement, as demonstrated by actions since 1945, then I would say one would be wiser not to grant clearance." [...] This led to outrage by many in the scientific community and Teller's ostracism and virtual expulsion from academic science.|$|E

500|$|During {{the late}} 20th century {{there was a}} gradual [...] "retreat" [...] from this rule; in Sagnata Investments Ltd v Norwich Corporation, the courts allowed Hansard {{material}} to be submitted to determine the purpose of legislation (but not to interpret the statute), and in Pickstone v Freemans plc, it was allowed {{to assist in the}} understanding of delegated legislation. A noted attack on the rule was made by Lord Denning in Davis v Johnson, where he said that asserting that the courts could not use Hansard was similar to saying that the judges [...] "should grope about in the dark for the meaning of an Act without switching on the light. In some cases Parliament is assured in the most explicit terms what the effect of a statute will be. It is on that footing that members assent to the clause being agreed to. It is on that understanding that an amendment is not pressed. In such <b>cases</b> <b>I</b> think the court should {{be able to look at}} the proceedings." [...] Despite these exceptions, the courts regularly maintained that it was not possible to use internal Parliamentary discussions as an aid to legislative interpretation. The result of Pepper was a reversal of that rule; a court could use internal Parliamentary discussions where it was relevant to [...] "the very point in question in the litigation", where a piece of legislation is [...] "ambiguous or obscure, or the literal meaning of which leads to an absurdity", with the intention being to understand [...] "the mischief aimed at or the legislative intention lying behind the ambiguous or obscure words".|$|E

2500|$|It is {{believed}} primary motivations were shared religion with the Mexicans and {{sympathy for the}} Mexican cause based on similarities between the situations in Mexico and Ireland. This hypothesis is based on evidence {{of the number of}} Irish Catholics in the Battalion, the letters of John Riley, and the field entries of senior officers. Another hypothesis is that the members of the Saint Patrick's Battalion had been unhappy with their treatment in the U.S. Army; this was the conviction of George Ballentine, an Englishman who served in the American army. Ballentine stated that while [...] "there was a portion of truth" [...] in the view—commonly assigned by officers—that the deserters joined the Mexican army due to their Catholicism, [...] "I have good reason to believe, in fact in some <b>cases</b> <b>I</b> know, that harsh and unjust treatment by their officers operated far more strongly than any other consideration to produce the deplorable result ," [...] describing how he found the punishments used for [...] "trivial offensives" [...] to be [...] "revolting and disgusting". Another theory some historians hold is that the soldiers were attracted by the incentives offered by the Mexican government: safe passage throughout Mexico for deserters, generous land grants, and the offer of potential military commissions. For poor people coming from famine conditions, economics was often an important incentive.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{surprisingly}} {{many cases}} go unreported. However, given the complexities involved, company {{policy is the}} first step and cannot wish away the problem. Says Savita HR Manager at Icelerate Technologies, [...] "We have a sexual harassment policy that is circulated among employees. Also the company will not tolerate any case that comes to its notice. But the man at home is no different from the person at the office," [...] thus implying the social mindset that discriminates against women is responsible for the problem. Considering sexual censorship and conservative social attitudes emphasizing [...] " [...] woman's purity," [...] the victim dare not draw attention for fear of being branded a woman with [...] "loose morals". Women would rather brush away the problem or leave jobs quietly rather than speak up, even in organizations that have a zero tolerance policy. Says Chandan, [...] "I do not have exact statistics but from my experience as an advocate one in 1,500 cases are reported." [...] The problem cannot be resolved till more women speak up but the social set-up browbeats women into silence. The social stigma against the victim and the prolonged litigation process for justice thwarts most women from raising their voice. Purports K Chandan [...] "It may take between three and five years to settle a case, and in a situation where the harassment is covert, evidence is hard to gather and {{there is no guarantee that}} the ruling would be in favour of the victim. In one of the rare <b>cases</b> <b>I</b> handled a Country Manager was accused and the plaintiff opted for an out of court settlement." ...|$|E

[...] "After thoroughly studying the case, {{it became clear to}} me that the best venue for prosecution was in federal court. I stand by that decision today," [...] Holder said. [...] "As the president has said, those unwise and unwarranted restrictions (imposed by Congress) undermine our counterterrorism efforts and could harm our national security.
