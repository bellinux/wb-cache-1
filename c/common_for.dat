5|$|According to Theissen and Merz, it is <b>common</b> <b>for</b> {{extraordinary}} charismatic leaders, such as Jesus, to {{come into}} conflict with their ordinary families. In Mark, Jesus' family comes to get him, fearing that he is mad (Mark 3:20–34), and this account is likely historical because early Christians would not have invented it. After Jesus' death, many {{members of his family}} joined the Christian movement. Jesus' brother James became a leader of the Jerusalem Church.|$|E
5|$|After a duel, it is <b>common</b> <b>for</b> {{two male}} giraffes to caress and court each other.

5|$|As is <b>common</b> <b>for</b> non-dominant wolf males, OR-7 {{left the}} Imnaha Pack in the Wallowa Mountains near Joseph in September 2011, presumably {{in search of}} a mate.

This marked the first known wild wolf presence in southwestern Oregon since 1946.|$|E
5|$|As {{the islands}} have no {{harbours}} or anchorages, the phosphate ships were loaded by securing to deep moorings and embarking their cargo via cantilever jetties. During south-westerly wind periods—which are common from November to March—the ships {{had to stop}} loading and sail away from the island until conditions improved. It was <b>common</b> <b>for</b> these ships {{to be allowed to}} drift to save fuel, and there were often several vessels lying off Nauru.|$|E

A unifying theme is <b>common</b> <b>for</b> larger events.|$|E

5|$|For an implant to osseointegrate, {{it needs}} to be {{surrounded}} by a healthy quantity of bone. In order for it to survive long-term, {{it needs to}} have a thick healthy soft tissue (gingiva) envelope around it.

He was also dismayed by the poor quality of marksmanship amongst the British troops.|$|E
5|$|In Predynastic and Early Dynastic times, the Egyptian climate {{was much}} less arid than it is today. Large regions of Egypt were covered in treed savanna and traversed by herds of grazing ungulates.
