The Polish support during the first ten months amounted to 328,000 Polish zloty.|$|E

5000|$|The first Elfquest {{story was}} {{published}} in February 1978, in the underground comic book Fantasy Quarterly, published by Lansing, Michigan-based IPS (Independent Publishers Syndicate).

Casey Brennan and illustrated by Cerebus the Aardvark creator Dave Sim titled [...] "Doorway to the Gods".) The quality of the publication was disappointing to Wendy and Richard Pini.

5000|$|The satirical {{illustrator}} José Guadalupe Posada, whose engravings about Mexican {{culture and}} politics challenged Mexicans to think differently about post-revolutionary Mexico, worked {{in full view}} of the public in shop windows located on the way Orozco went to school. In his autobiography, Orozco confesses, [...] "I would stop my way to and from school and spend a few enchanted minutes in watching Posada… This was the push that first set my imagination in motion and impelled me to <b>cover</b> <b>paper</b> with my earliest little figures; this was my awakening to the existence of the art of painting" [...] (Orozco, 1962). He goes on to say that watching Posada's engraving decorated gave him his introduction to the use of color. After attending school for Agriculture and Architecture, Orozco studied art at the Academy of San Carlos. He worked as an illustrator for Mexico City newspapers and directly as an illustrator for one of the Constitutionalist armies overseen by [...] "First Chief" [...] Venustiano Carranza. When the revolutionary factions split in 1914 after Victoriano Huerta was ousted, Orozco supported Carranza and General Álvaro Obregón against Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{collection}} of six papers and a <b>cover</b> <b>paper</b> reporting an exploration of how {{to strike a balance between}} individual task execution and work articulation in Computer-supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). The interest in this theme is motivated by an increased reliance of IT-supported cooperative work arrangements in modern organizations, the fragmented layout of work for multitasking individuals and reports on various forms of overload, increased level of stress and anxiety experienced by workers active in these organizations. Modern organizations are increasingly reliant on IT-supported cooperative work arrangements for doing work. Cooperators are not only expected to execute assigned tasks, but also to engage in work articulation. This is a term used to describe the process of rich and frequent interaction needed for securing that the contributions of cooperator...|$|E

30|$|Brilliant green (BG) is a {{triphenylmethane dye}} {{that has been}} used as {{antiseptic}} and fungicide in fisheries and aquaculture. This dye is effective in the prevention and treatment of certain fish disease (Culp et al. 2006). It has also been used widely in dyeing cotton and paper industry for the production of <b>cover</b> <b>paper</b> (Mall et al. 1996; Srivastava et al. 2005; Mane et al. 2007). However, like two other dyes in the triphenylmethane family (malachite green and crystal violet), BG has generated critical concerns regarding its use in aquaculture, due to its reported toxic effects. It is readily absorbed into fish tissue from water and then causes serious damage to fish internal organs. Also, this dye has mutagenic and carcinogenic effects that affect human health (Dutta 1994; McKay et al. 1985; Krishna and Bhattacharyya 2003). Thus, the use of BG has been banned in many countries including the USA, Canada and the European Union (Plakas et al. 1995).|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports a}} {{research}} effort that comprises six papers and a <b>cover</b> <b>paper.</b> In essence, the thesis {{contributes to the}} understanding of collaborative settings by introducing the perspective of 'places of collaboration‘. This perspective is particularly important when designing computer-based technologies that support collaborative settings. The starting point and overall research aim is to understand people‘s efforts to configure their current context for the purposes of collaboration. The <b>cover</b> <b>paper</b> of the thesis comprises a theoretical reflection and examination of four collaborative settings. The settings have been studied in situ through ethnographic inquiry and the results are reported in the six papers enclosed in the thesis. In my theoretical reflection, the concepts of 'place‘, 'space‘ and 'boundary objects‘ are central. The studies revealed that people‘s efforts to configure the current context create and reflect a 'place of collaboration‘. In other words, the effort to configure the context results in a practice characterized by an understanding of how to cooperate; a collaborative practice that constitutes a 'place of collaboration‘. During this configuration, the space and the use of materiality in this space are important parts {{in the creation of a}} place of collaboration. In addition, people configure collaborative contexts of intersecting practices by creating boundary objects. Boundary objects serve as mediators in a place-making process for the integration of places into a 'place of collaboration‘ for several practices. What is more, the dynamics of a place of collaboration may affect changes in existing modes of working and in computer-based tools that have been introduced into the workplace. The people and practices that constitute the place will in turn re-configure the place of collaboration, including the space and objects available due to the new circumstances. People‘s configuration of their current context reveals crucial aspects about the place of collaboration that must be considered also when designing to support this setting. However, this configuration may not necessarily equal efficiency and effectiveness, as evaluated by actors external to this context. The conclusion of this thesis is that future research and design should consider how to support people in their own effort to configure their collaborative context...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{featured}} {{on the cover of}} a journal has more visibility in an issue compared with other ordinary articles for both printed and electronic journal. Does this kind of visibility guarantee more attention and greater impact of its associated content than the non-cover papers? In this research, usage and citation data of 60 issues of PLOS Biology from 2006 to 2010 are analyzed to compare the attention and scholarly impact between cover and non-cover paper.
