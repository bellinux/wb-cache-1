40|$|The {{process of}} {{calcining}} petroleum coke in a rotary kiln {{for the production}} of anodes is a very complicated exothermic reaction. Mathematically modeling the rotary kiln used for the calcination of the coke is very difficult, because the main problem is that the relationships between input variables and control variables are complex, nonlinear, containing time lags and interrelationships, and that the kiln&# 39;s response to control inputs depends on the prevailing kiln conditions. A set of fuzzy control rules, which has successfully been used in controlling the petroleum coke calcining rotary kiln in a practical aluminum plant of China, is presented in this paper.

40|$|The {{full report}} {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} several studies relating to hazardous waste combustion in cement and lime kilns. The tests {{included in this study}} are four kilns tested by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), four kilns tested by State agencies or the kiln operator, two Canadian tests, and one Swedish test. The predominant types of wastes tested included chlorinated organic compounds, aromatic compounds, and metalcontaminated waste oil. The kiln types include lime kilns and cement kilns, which included the dry, wet, and preheated processes. Fabric filters and electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) were the pollution control devices used in these processes, and the primary fuels included coal, coke, coal/coke, fuel oil, and natural gas/coke. The parameters examined in this study were Destruction and Removal Efficiency (DRE) of the Principal Organic Hazardous Constituents, particulate and HCI emissions, metals, and the effect of burning hazardous waste on SO 2 NOx, and CO emissions. The primary conclusion {{of this study is that}} DRES of 99. 99 % or greater can be obtained in properly operating <b>calcining</b> <b>kilns.</b> Particulate matter can increase when chlorinated wastes are burned in a kiln equipped with an electrostatic precipitator.

40|$|Lime is a {{fundamental}} component in many industrial, agricultural and chemical processes, and is itself produced by an industrial process, namely, the heating in <b>kilns</b> (<b>calcining,</b> or more colloquially â€˜burningâ€™) of calcium carbonate rock or other carbonate material. Research and literature on lime burning in Scotland, based largely on lime production in Scotland's eastern Central Belt, are dominated by the view that lime burning in draw kilns is the paradigm for Scottish lime production. Other parts of Scotland, however, largely or completely ignored, draw kilns in favour of simpler clamp kilns, even in major industrial sites of lime production.

5000|$|The {{ultimate}} {{development is}} the [...] "air-separate" [...] precalciner, in which the hot combustion air for the calciner arrives in a duct directly from the cooler, bypassing the kiln. Typically, 60-75% of the fuel is burned in the precalciner. In these systems, the feed entering the rotary <b>kiln</b> is 100% <b>calcined.</b> The <b>kiln</b> has only to raise the feed to sintering temperature. In theory the maximum efficiency would be achieved if all the fuel were burned in the preheater, but the sintering operation involves partial melting and nodulization to make clinker, and the rolling action of the rotary kiln remains {{the most efficient way}} of doing this. Large modern installations typically have two parallel strings of 4 or 5 cyclones, with one attached to the kiln and the other attached to the precalciner chamber. A rotary kiln of 6 x 100 m makes 8,000-10,000 tonnes per day, using about 0.10-0.11 tonnes of coal fuel for every tonne of clinker produced. The kiln is dwarfed by the massive preheater tower and cooler in these installations. Such a kiln produces 3 million tonnes of clinker per year, and consumes 300,000 tonnes of coal. A diameter of 6 m appears to be the limit of size of rotary kilns, because the flexibility of the steel shell becomes unmanageable at or above this size, and the firebrick lining tends to fail when the kiln flexes.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} {{cyclones}} stages used in practice varies from 1 to 6. Energy, {{in the form}} of fan-power, is required to draw the gases through the string of cyclones, and at a string of 6 cyclones, the cost of the added fan-power needed for an extra cyclone exceeds the efficiency advantage gained. It is normal to use the warm exhaust gas to dry the raw materials in the rawmill, and if the raw materials are wet, hot gas from a less efficient preheater is desirable. For this reason, the most commonly encountered suspension preheaters have 4 cyclones. The hot feed that leaves the base of the preheater string is typically 20% <b>calcined,</b> so the <b>kiln</b> has less subsequent processing to do, and can therefore achieve a higher specific output. Typical large systems installed in the early 1970s had cyclones 6 m in diameter, a rotary kiln of 5 x 75 m, making 2500 tonnes per day, using about 0.11-0.12 tonnes of coal fuel for every tonne of clinker produced.|$|R
40|$|Japanese medieval ceramic {{was made}} {{from the end of}} the Heian era to the Muromachi age. It was made with the {{technologies}} of old glaze pottery and the Sueki Tradition. Kilns used to make this ceramic were located in Seto, Atsumi, Tokoname, Echizen, Tanba, Bizen, Shigaraki, and Suzu. It is usually found in archeological digs of burial sites, having been utilized as a container for human remains. Another use was as a receptacle for Buddhist holy writings that were buried (Kyouzuka) to preserve them for their intended purpose in the far distant future. These medieval people practiced a religious life of fervent Buddhism and Taoism. Medieval ceramic was not to be used for ordinary daily purposes but rather for religious purposes. Seto pottery has a glaze with a light green color; it is similar to Chinese ceramic. The meaning of patterns such as 2 Ì† 7 lotus flower 2 Ì† 7 and 2 Ì† 7 autumn view 2 Ì† 7 on jars from Atsumi and Suzu was "pure land". Jars from Tokoname, Echizen, and Tanba are covered with a natural glaze. The natural glaze is formed during <b>calcining</b> in the <b>kiln,</b> the vessel having been coated with wood ash. Medieval people believed the fire god created the natural glaze. Jars covered in natural glaze were symbolic of another world and pure land.

40|$|The use of High Performance Concrete (HPC) in Iowa has {{consisted}} of achieving slightly higher compressive strengths {{with an emphasis}} on reduced permeability. Concrete with reduced permeability has increased durability by slowing moisture and chloride ingress. Achieving reduced permeability has typically been accomplished with combinations of slag and Class C fly ash, or the use of blended cements such as locally available Type IS(20), IS(25) and Type IP(25) in conjunction with Class C fly ash. Fly ash has been used in the majority of concrete placed in Iowa since 1984 and slag has been available in Iowa since 1995. During the economic downturn in 2008, one of the cement plants that produced a Type IS(25) cement was forced to shut down, which reduced the availability of blended cements, typically used on HPC deck overlays. Recently, a source of high reactivity metakaolin has been made available. Metakaolin is produced by heating a pure kaolinite clay to 650 to 700 Â°C in a rotary <b>kiln</b> (<b>calcining).</b> Metakaolin is a white pozzolan that is used to produce concrete with increased strengths, reduced permeability, reduced efflorescence, and resistance to alkali silica reactivity. The W. R. Grace MK- 100 metakaolin will likely be available in dissolvable bags between 25 and 50 pounds. Thus, the mix designs were based on the anticipated bag size range for field use. This research evaluated metakaolin mixes with and without Class C fly ash. Results indicated a seven percent replacement with metakaolin produced concrete with increased strengths and low permeability. When used with Class C fly ash, permeability is reduced to very low rating. Metakaolin may be used to enhance hardened concrete properties for use in high performance concrete (HPC) ...|$|R
40|$|The Penrice Quarry in South Australia mines {{chemically}} pure marble {{for use in}} the chemical industry. The Quarry's major customer is the Penrice Soda Products plant at Osborne, S. A., where 508, 000 tonnes of high grade marble are used per annum. The marble is burnt in vertical shaft <b>kilns</b> (<b>calcining)</b> as part of the Solvay Process for soda ash (sodium carbonate) manufacture. Since early 1993 the kilns operations have been plagued by elevated kiln pressures coupled with the production of undesirable wastes called 'grits' (i. e. fine grained, partly calcined marble). These undesirable operating parameters and end products create limitations within the kilns plant and ultimately affect the down stream production of soda ash. It is known that the Penrice marble, although {{chemically pure}}, does not always behave ideally during calcining as it often has a tendency to disintegrate in the kilns. This disintegration, termed 'decrepitation', generates excessive amounts of granular material that interferes with the airflow updraft in the kilns. This results in elevated kiln pressures, increases in 'grits' production and difficulties in controlling other operating parameters. Given these criteria, it was apparent that this decrepitation had been the major contributor to these poor kilns performances since early 1993. Consequently, it was decided that a series of new investigations needed to be undertaken to determine: i. The major cause(s) at the quarry of potentially decrepitating marble given that the kilns operations are essentially constant, ii. Why the levels of decrepitation have increased, and iii What changes could be made to current quarry practices to prevent or at least minimise the occurrence of decrepitating marble. These investigations commenced with a break down of the current mining practices at the quarry which indicated that the most significant change to occur was the introduction of new production scheduling procedures (i. e. in-pit blending). Production records showed that since the introduction of these new scheduling procedures a significant proportion of marble for the Osborne plant was sourced from the lower benches in the northern end of the pit. Historically this marble was considered to be of unsuitable grade for the Osborne plant and as such almost all Osborne marble was sourced from {{the southern end of the}} pit. Further investigations indicated that the major difference between the southern and northern ends of the pit was that much of the mining in the northern end of the pit was below the water table and necessitated the use of waterproof explosives (i. e. Handibullc Wet*). For this reason it was decided to engage ICI Explosives to undertake some trial blasts and subsequent photogrammetric analyses to determine the differences between wet and dry blasts and the influence they had on the production of potentially decrepitating marble. The trials showed that both wet and dry hole blasts produced structurally weak marble around the explosive column in the blastholes, which was subsequently termed 'blast affected marble'. The main finding of the blasting trials was that wet hole blasting (Handibulk Wet) produced 6. 6 per cent blast affected marble while dry hole blasting (ANFO) produced only 1. 5 per cent. These results suggested that the increase in decrepitation and therefore poor kiln performances were linked to an increase in the utilisation of low strength (i. e. blast affected) marble as a result of increased wet hole blasting. Petrographic analyses were undertaken by the author in an effort to understand the nature and intensity of the fracture systems produced via blasting and how those findings could be related to blasting practices. Some point load strength tests were also conducted in order to gain an appreciation of the degree of strength loss produced between heavily blast affected marble and marble unaffected by blasting. Blend changes incorporating less marble from the northern end of the pit have helped to alleviate the problem while further work is continuing into alternative explosive types and dewatering methods within the lower benches of the pit to enable ANFO type explosives to be used...|$|R
