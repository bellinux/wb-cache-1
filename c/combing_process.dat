60|$|Hare {{followed}} August's example, {{sitting down}} and speaking no word. His eyes, however, roved discreetly to and fro. Eschtah's three wives presented great differences in age and appearance. The eldest was a wrinkled, parchment-skinned old hag who sat sightless before the fire; the next was a solid square squaw, employed in the task of combing a naked boy's hair with a comb made of stiff thin roots tied tightly in a round bunch. Judging from the youngster's actions and grimaces, this <b>combing</b> <b>process</b> was not a pleasant one. The third wife, much younger, had a comely face, and long braids of black hair, of which, evidently, she was proud. She leaned on her knees over a flat slab of rock, and holding in her hands a long oval stone, she rolled and mashed corn into meal. There were young braves, handsome in their bronze-skinned way, with bands binding their straight thick hair, silver rings in their ears, silver bracelets on their wrists, silver buttons on their moccasins. There were girls who looked up from their blanket-weaving with shy curiosity, {{and then turned to}} their frames strung with long threads. Under their nimble fingers the wool-carrying needles slipped in and out, and the colored stripes grew apace. Then there were younger boys and girls, all bright-eyed and curious; and babies sleeping on blankets. Where the walls and ceiling were not covered with buckskin garments, weapons and blankets, Hare saw the white wood-ribs of the hogan structure. It was a work of art, this circular house of forked logs and branches, interwoven into a dome, arched and strong, and all covered and cemented with clay.|$|E

Our work offers an interactive visual analytic alternative to the current, manually intensive methodology used in the search for evidence in large email data sets.

50|$|The wool {{processing}} within the mill consisted of various stages: sorting and grading, scouring, drying and dying, carding, combing, spinning, weaving, brushing, and sewing. Each stage {{was carried out}} in a separate area of the mill, with each process flowing onto the next in a hierarchical structure; this was a design feature to facilitate efficiency in the mill. In the two smaller south rooms the wool was sorted and graded to determine how it would be processed; the scouring vats were located in the south west room, and here the wool was cleaned of impurities and steam dried and dyed if required. The remainder of the process {{was carried out in}} the main area of the mill. The mill contained ten carding machines; these large machines broke up the wool and removed impurities. The <b>combing</b> <b>process</b> further organised the woollen fibres. The largest machines in the mill were the spinning mules on which the wool was spun. The wool was then woven into fabrics on the weaving looms. The woven fabric then went through shaving machines to give the cloth a fine finish.

40|$|Molecular combing is a {{powerful}} procedure for aligning a large array of DNA molecules onto a surface. This technique usually leads to an overstretching of about 150 % of the molecules' contour length. By changing the magnitude of capillary forces during the <b>combing</b> <b>process,</b> {{we were able to}} reduce the relative extension of the DNA molecules. Thus we achieved combing of T 7 DNA with an extension close to its molecule contour length. We checked the ability of combed DNA to interact with DNA binding proteins. Using the T 7 bacteriophage transcription system, we investigated the transcription activity of RNA polymerase on combed DNA by direct visualization of newly synthesized fluorescent RNAs. Our experiments show that no transcription activity occurs on overstretched DNA molecules, whereas we observe a transcription activity for nonoverstretched molecules. This activity is observed both in multiple initiation experiments and for one immobilized T 7 RNA polymerase per promoter.

After the TFO has wound around the target sequence by ligand-induced triple helix formation, its extremities hybri-dize to each other, leaving a dangling single-stranded sequence, which is then ligated to a ¯uor-escent dsDNA fragment using T 4 DNA ligase.

In present work deals making a composite of natural fibers like Banana, Borassus, Jute and Siasal (BBJS) as fibers and give a brief explanation of advances and characterization of new set of natural fiber composites. It has prepared by reinforcing BBJS fibers with epoxy resin and hardener in matrix by using hand layup technique. The reinforcing material may be in the form of fibers, particles or flakes. Reinforcement usually adds rigidity and greatly impedes fracture promulgation. Skinny fibers can have high potency, and provided they are mechanically well attached to the matrix they can greatly improve the composite's overall properties. Fibres are used to carry the load and matrix is used to bind and transmit the load to fibers. The natural fibers were prepared from the raw material by retting and <b>combing</b> <b>process.</b> Composites were prepared as cylindrical shape by using BBJS as fibers of 1 : 1 : 1 : 1, 1 : 2 : 2 : 2, 2 : 1 : 2 : 2, 2 : 2 : 1 : 2 and 2 : 2 : 2 : 1 weight fraction.

The long, coarse guard hair is then typically clipped from the animal and is often used for brushes, interfacings and other non-apparel uses. Animals in Iran, Afghanistan, New Zealand, and Australia are typically shorn of their fleece, resulting in a higher coarse hair content and lower pure cashmere yield.

The proposed isolation method provides elec-trical isolation and mechanical coupling of SOI structures without additional dielectric backfill and planarization by utilizing timed etched backside handle wafer structures. The backside island is a hidden layer beneath the gimbal and allows independent appli-cation of actuation potentials to the gimbal and inner mirror. We developed the fabrication process that accommodates the back-side island isolation structures into an established vertical <b>comb</b> drive <b>process,</b> thereby allowing implementation of two-axis gim-baled structures.

However, the simultaneous interaction of {{hundreds or thousands}} of optical comb frequencies with the same number of resonator modes leads to complicated nonlinear dynamics that are far from fully understood.

Each of these microresonator platforms utilizes a scheme in which the system is pumped by a single-frequency laser at a cavity resonance. This scheme requires tuning of the pump wavelength into resonance and the generated comb is susceptible to fluctuations in pump power or frequency which can disrupt the soft thermal lock and comb generation. We demonstrate a novel fiber-microresonator dual-cavity architecture that preferentially oscillates at modes of the microresonator due to its high density of states and generates robust and broadband combs (> 900 nm) without an external pump laser. Such a scheme could greatly simplify the <b>comb</b> generation <b>process</b> and allow for a fully-integrated chip-scale source with an on-chip amplifier. Comment: 14 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{frequency comb}} generation in dispersive singly resonant second-harmonic-generation cavity systems. Using a single temporal mean-field equation for the fundamental field {{that features a}} noninstantaneous nonlinear response function, we model the temporal and spectral dynamics and analyze comb generation, continuous wave bistability, and modulational instability. It is found that, owing to the significant temporal walk-off between the fundamental and second-harmonic fields, modulational instability can occur even in the complete absence of group-velocity dispersion. We further consider the relation of our model to a previously proposed modal expansion approach, and present a derivation of a general system of coupled mode equations. We show that the two models provide very similar predictions and become exactly equivalent in the limit that absorption losses and group-velocity dispersion at the fundamental frequency are neglected. Finally, we perform numerical simulations that show examples {{of the variety of}} comb states that are possible in phase-matched quadratic resonators, and discuss the dynamics of the <b>comb</b> formation <b>process.</b> SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

We study the properties of channels on $K$, which are defined as affine maps from $K$ into the state space of another algebra, extending to completely positive maps on the subspace generated by $K$. We show that each such map is the restriction of a completely positive map on the whole algebra, called a generalized channel. We characterize the set of generalized channels and also the equivalence classes of generalized channels having the same value on $K$. Moreover, if $K$ contains the tracial state, the set of generalized channels forms again a convex subset of a multipartite state space, {{this leads to a}} definition of a generalized supermap, which is a generalized channel with respect to this subset.

Our microscanner-fabrication process requires three photolithography masks: two to form the front-side microscanner structures and a third to define the backside openings. Both moving and fixed combs are fabricated in the same device layer (30 µm in thickness), and the offset combs are created by reducing {{the thickness of the}} fixed combs, but not that of the moving <b>combs.</b> Our <b>process</b> begins by removing the 1 -µm thick thermal oxide selectively to open rectangular windows at locations where the fixed combs are to be defined.

We then perform a tuned-etch in the DRIE-etcher to obtain the desired vertical thickness for the fixed combs without affecting the moving combs. The minimum gap between comb fingers can be as small as twice the alignment accuracy of the photolithography process, which is ≤ 0. 4 µm for state-of-the-art photolithography steppers.
