We have carried out large scale molecular dynamics simulations of Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluids composed of monomers, dimers, or trimers to investigate these processes with molecular detail. For LJ monomers in contact with a vacuum, the evaporation rate {{is found to be}} very high with significant evaporative cooling and an accompanying density gradient in the liquid domain near the liquid/vapor interface. Increasing the chain length to just dimers significantly reduces the evaporation rate. We confirm that mechanical equilibrium {{plays a key role in}} determining the evaporation rate and the density and temperature profiles across the liquid/vapor interface. The velocity distributions of evaporated molecules and the evaporation and <b>condensation</b> <b>coefficients</b> are measured and compared to the predictions of an existing model based on kinetic theory of gases.

For the same reduced temperature $T/T_c$, where $T_c$ is the critical temperature, these two coefficients are higher for LJ dimers and trimers than for monomers, in contrast to the traditional viewpoint that they are close to unity for monatomic molecules and decrease for polyatomic molecules.

In particular, the reported {{dependence of the}} <b>condensation</b> <b>coefficient</b> on pressure has raised questions about both the precision of the reported data and {{the validity of the}} basic interphase mass transfer analysis. An error analysis presented in this investigation indicates that the reported pressure dependence of the <b>condensation</b> <b>coefficient</b> at higher pressures is due to an inherent limitation in the precision of the condensing wall temperature measurement. The magnitude of this limitation in precision is different for the various test systems used. The analysis shows, however, that the primary variable affecting the precision of the wall temperature measurement is the thermal conductivity of the condensing block. To verify the analysis, potassium was condensed on a vertical surface of a copper condensing block. The copper block was protected from the potassium with nickel plating. Condensation coefficients near unity were obtained out to higher pressures than those previously reported for potassium condensed with stainless steel or nickel condensing blocks.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} to desalination of water whereby a pressure difference across a vapor-trapping nanopore induces selective transport of water by isothermal evaporation and condensation across the pore. Transport of water through a nanopore with saline water on one side and pure water on the other side under a pressure difference was theoretically analyzed under the rarefied gas assumption using a probabilistic framework that accounts for diffuse scattering from the pore walls as well as reflection from the menisci. The analysis revealed that in addition to salinity, temperature, and pressure difference, the nanopore aspect ratio and the probability of condensation of a water molecule incident on a meniscus from the vapor phase, known as the <b>condensation</b> <b>coefficient,</b> are key determinants of flux. The effect of <b>condensation</b> <b>coefficient</b> on mass flux becomes critical when the aspect ratio is small. However, the mass flux becomes independent of the <b>condensation</b> <b>coefficient</b> as the pore aspect ratio increases, converging to the Knudsen flux for long nanopores. For design of a nanopore membrane that can trap vapor, a minimum aspect ratio is derived for which coalescence of the two interfaces {{on either side of the}} nanopore remains energetically unfavorable.
