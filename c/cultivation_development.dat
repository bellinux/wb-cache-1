This research consisted of two separate experiments, an evaluation on rice grown in nutrient solution in the greenhouse of ICABIOGRAD, Bogor; and field evaluation at upland rice screening site Taman Bogo, Lampung. The rice lines used were BC 2 F 3 derived from crossing of Situ Bagendit with Kasalath and NIL-C 443, and from crossing of Batur with Kasalath and NIL-C 443. Molecular analysis was conducted to verifiy the Pup 1 introgression in the lines used and successfully confirmed the occurance of homozygote Pup 1 segment in those lines. Evaluation of rice lines grown in nutrient solution was performed in a split plot factorial design, using the dose of Al (0 and 45 ppm Al 3 +) as main plots and dose of P (0. 5 and 10 ppm P) as subplots. Field evaluation was performed in split plot design, with P fertilization (0 and 500 kg SP- 18 ha- 1) as main plots and BC 2 F 3 lines as the subplots. Evaluation using Yoshida nutrient solution showed that the BC 2 F 3 lines had greater total dry weight under low-P condition (37. 5 - 112. 5 %), especially under Al-toxicity, compared to the respective parental varieties (Situ Bagendit and Batur).

40|$|The {{decline in}} {{available}} {{fossil fuel resources}} coupled with an ever increasing global demand for energy, have led to substantial interest {{in the development of}} renewable biofuels. Biofuels from microalgae, especially liquid fuels produced from saline microalgae lipids (oils), are seen as {{an important component of the}} future biofuels mix. In Australia, several companies and research groups are working on developing microalgal biofuels and whilst most are still in the research and development stage, recently constructed demonstration facilities highlight the potential for large-scale cultivation. Western Australia (WA) specifically, has several key advantages for large-scale microalgae for biofuel cultivation including abundant sunshine, extensive land area unsuitable for agriculture, an abundant water source in the Indian Ocean, existing infrastructure in several potential locations, high local demand for fuel and stable political conditions. The purpose of this study was to identify capable geographic locations for constructing large-scale microalgae for biofuel cultivation facilities in WA. Through the development of the Australian Algal Cultivation-Spatial Location Model (AAC-SLM) an examination of site specific parameters such as irradiance, temperature, CO 2 and nutrient availability, workability of soils, land-use and access to distribution infrastructure and a viable workforce, most capable locations for large-scale microalgae cultivation were identified in the state.

40|$|The Taligny marsh {{is located}} {{downstream}} in the Négron River catchment (southwestern Parisian basin). 33 boreholes {{performed in the}} marsh show that it contains a maximum thickness of 5. 80 m sediments. Their composition varies from a sandy-gravely end in {{the lower part of}} the pile to a peaty end in the upper part, the silty phase being the most abundant in the whole sediment store. The sedimentation has been continuous since at least 4360 yrs cal. BC. The accumulation rates of organic matter (TaOM) on one hand and of mineral matter (TaMM) on the other were calculated in g. m- 2. yr- 1 from cores located in the middle of the marsh (47 ° 07 ' 812 N; 0 ° 11 ' 494 E). These values have been correlated with that of the pollen and malacofauna analysis, and to the palaeoclimate data (temperature: T and precipitation: P). There is no significant negative correlation between TaOM and TaMM during the Upper Holocene. For exemple, high values of TaMM can be synchronous with high values of TaOM, particularly during the Subatlantic. OM accumulation does not depend on the climate variations expressed by P. The high values of TaOM are clearly related to Alnus forest clearance and to its substitution by Cyperaceae and paludicol taxa in the marsh (Iron and Middle Ages). Cyperaceae and paludicol taxa development results in an increase of OM supply on the soil surface and the rising of the water table, confirmed by the malacofauna data, due to the evapotranspiration decrease. MM accumulation, mainly related to the sediment yield by the catchment, does not show any one-to-one significant relation neither to climatic parameters (P or T) nor to the vegetation assemblages (forest vs. meadows or cultivation). TaMM was higher during period of <b>cultivation</b> <b>development</b> (dry and warm Neolithic, and humid cold or cool second part of the Middle Age and Modern times). TaMM was lower and little varying during the other periods (Bronze, Iron, Gallo-roman and first part of the Middle Age) due to the antagonistic effects or the little variations of the climatic parameters and the landuse (forest vs. meadows). The hydrodynamic during periods of fen development (mainly during the Middle Age) seems to have been little favorable to the retention of suspended matter in the marsh, even if the sediment yield was high in the catchment...|$|E
