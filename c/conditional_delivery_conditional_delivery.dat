40|$|The {{design of}} a {{distributed}} multimedia application involves both temporal and spatial synchronization problems related to the processing, transport, storage, retrieval and presentation of data, sound, still images and video. Within this general framework, the paper aims at defining a new multimedia synchronization mechanism, the so-called <b>conditional</b> <b>delivery</b> mechanism, which appears particularly useful for achieving both intra- and interstream synchronization. Main motivations behind this synchronization mechanism are first discussed on a simple example, namely a distributed application {{in the area of}} distance and interactive training, and then the details of the mechanism are presented.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the formal {{specification}} of a general-purpose multimedia synchronization mechanism, known as the <b>conditional</b> <b>delivery</b> mechanism capable of addressing both intraand inter-stream synchronization issues.

40|$|In plants, cell {{polarity}} {{and tissue}} patterning are connected by intercellular {{flow of the}} phytohormone auxin, whose directional signaling depends on polar subcellular localization of PIN auxin transport proteins. The mechanism of polar targeting of PINs or other cargos in plants is largely unidentified, with the PINOID kinase being the only known molecular component. Here, we identify PP 2 A phosphatase as an important regulator of PIN apical-basal targeting and auxin distribution. Genetic analysis, localization, and phosphorylation studies demonstrate that PP 2 A and PINOID both partially colocalize with PINs and act antagonistically on the phosphorylation state of their central hydrophilic loop, hence mediating PIN apicalbasal polar targeting. Thus, in plants, polar sorting by the reversible phosphorylation of cargos allows for their <b>conditional</b> <b>delivery</b> to specific intracellular destinations. In the case of PIN proteins, this mechanism enables switches {{in the direction of}} intercellular auxin fluxes, which mediate differential growth, tissue patterning, and organogenesis...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES. Circumstances of {{delivery}} among children with {{acquired immunodeficiency syndrome}} (AIDS) were investigated to assess whether they were consistent with predictions that intrapartum factors affect the risk of maternal-infant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. METHODS. Pediatric AIDS patients (maternal-infant transmission; n = 632) reported to the New York City Health Department through 1991 were compared {{with a series of}} infants born to predominantly uninfected women. For each case patient, five control subjects were selected and matched from birth certificate files. Hypothesized case-control comparisons for mode {{of delivery}} and preselected complications were tested. RESULTS. Compared with control subjects, case patients were less likely to have been delivered by cesarean section without complications (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 77; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 59, 1. 01) and {{more likely to have been}} delivered with complications, whether delivery was by cesarean section (OR = 1. 54; 95 % CI = 0. 98, 2. 43) or vaginal (OR = 1. 66; 95 % CI = 1. 15, 2. 39). CONCLUSIONS. Assuming that HIV-infected and uninfected women have comparable circumstances of <b>delivery,</b> <b>conditional</b> on sociomedical characteristics, these results suggest that intrapartum events may be associated with maternal-infant HIV transmission...|$|R

40|$|We propose {{deriving}} wireless {{simulation models}} from experimental traces of radio signal strength.

Our approach results in more accurate packet reception ratios than current simulation methods, reducing the absolute error in PRR by up to about 30 %. We also find that using CPM for signal strength improves simulation of packet burstiness, reducing the Kantorovich-Wasserstein (KW) distance of <b>conditional</b> packet <b>delivery</b> functions (CPDFs) by a factor of about 3 for intermediate links.

40|$|Background: India {{launched}} JSY {{cash transfer}} programme to increase access to emergency obstetric and neonatal care (EmONC) by incentivising in-facility births. This increased in-facility births from 30 % in 2005 to 73 % in 2012 however, decline in maternal mortality follows a secular trend. Dysfunctional referral services {{can contribute to}} poor programme impact on outcomes. We hence describe inter-facility referrals and study quality of referral services in JSY. Methods and Results: Women accessing intra natal care (n = 1182) at facilities (reporting > 10 deliveries/month, n = 96) were interviewed in a 5 day cross sectional survey in 3 districts of Madhya Pradesh province. A nested matched case control study (n = 68 pairs) was performed to study association between maternal referral and adverse birth outcomes. There were 111 (9. 4 %) in referrals and 69 (5. 8 %) out referrals. Secondary level facilities sent most referrals and 40 % were for conditions expected to be treated at this level. There were 36 adverse birth outcomes (intra partum and in-facility deaths). After matching for type of complication and place of <b>delivery,</b> <b>conditional</b> logistic regression model showed maternal referral at term delivery was associated with higher odds of adverse birth outcomes (OR- 2. 6, 95 % CI: 1. 0 - 6. 6 p = 0. 04). Maternal death record review (April 10 -March 12) was conducted at the CEmOC facility in one district. Spatial analysis of transfer time from sending to the receiving CEmOC facility among in-facility maternal deaths was conducted in ArcGIS 10 applying two hours (equated to 100 Km) as desired transfer time. There were 124 maternal deaths, 55 of which were among mothers referred in. Buffer analysis revealed 98 % mothers were referred from < 2 hours. Median time between arrival and death was 6. 75 hours. Conclusions: High odds of adverse birth outcomes associated with maternal referral and high maternal deaths despite spatial access to referral care indicate poor quality of referral services...|$|R

We propose a novel multilevel approach, the M&M model, involving hidden Markov models (HMMs) and mixtures of multivariate Bernoullis (MMBs) for modeling the long and short time-scale behavior of wireless links from 802. 15. 4 test beds. We characterize the synthetic traces generated from our model of the wireless link in terms of the mean and variance of the packet reception rates from the data traces, comparison of distributions of run lengths, and <b>conditional</b> packet <b>delivery</b> functions of successive packet receptions (1 ’s) and losses (0 ’s).

Tn 917 -lac transposition occurred at a frequency of ca. 1036 with 20 % of the resultant emr clones displaying varying levels of lacZ expression. Tn 917 -lac mutants that expressed L-galactosidase activity under growth conditions of glucose limitation, acidic pH, 35 mM NaCl, and elevated (42 ‡C) temperature were isolated.

The L-gal activity of AS 42 also was found to be repressed 3 -fold in medium containing 2 % glucose relative to measured activity from cells suspended in the same medium containing no glucose. Further phenotypic analysis revealed that AS 42 had a 30 % lower growth yield than the parent strain NG 8 when grown in pH 5 medium.

Theory and methods: Focus groups with {{healthcare providers}} in an integrated care setting for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were conducted to examine the recognisability of the conceptual framework and to explore critical success factors for collaborative COPD practice out of this framework. The resulting items were transposed into a pilot instrument. This was reviewed by expert opinion and completed 153 times by healthcare providers. The underlying structure and internal consistency of the instrument were verified by factor analysis and Cronbach’s alpha. Results: The conceptual framework turned out to be comprehensible for discussing teamwork effectiveness. The pilot instrument measures 25 relevant aspects of teamwork in integrated COPD care. Factor analysis suggested three reliable components: teamwork effectiveness, team processes and team psychosocial traits (Cronbach’s alpha between 0. 76 and 0. 81).

40|$|Background: Pancreatic islet {{transplantation}} {{has emerged}} as a promising treatment for type I diabetes. However, its efficacy is severely hampered due to poor islet engraftment and revascularization, which have been resulted to partially loss of transplanted islets. It has been shown that local delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) could accelerate transplanted islet revascularization, although permanent high level of VEGF may lead to undesirable side effects. In this study we investigated the effects of <b>conditional</b> cell-based <b>delivery</b> of VEGF through collagen-fibrin hydrogel on transplanted islet function and revascularization. Material and Methods: RH 6 human embryonic stem cell derived mesenchymal stem cells (ES-MSCs) have been generated, characterized and transduced by two lentiviruses containing rtTA and VEGF-A. Tet-on expression of VEGF from these cells was shown by tube formation assay and was confirmed through VEGF ELISA. After co-transplantation of these cells and mouse isolated islets through collagen-fibrin hydrogel in the omental pouch of diabetic nude mice, the blood glucose, body weight, glucose tolerance and serum C-peptide was measured after 28 days. As control groups, islets were transplanted alone and with non-transgenic ES-MSCs. For measurement of revascularization, immunohistoflourscence examination was done and micro vessel density (MVD) and vessel size have been measured. Results: Receiving the same number of islets (300 IEQ) in all transplanted groups, the average blood glucose concentrations of mice transplanted with islets/hESC-MSC:VEGF were significantly lower than mice transplanted with islets or islet/hESC-MSC at different time points. This notable difference in blood sugar of transplant groups, was also reflected in their weight gain. Serum C-peptide level was higher in islet/hESC-MSC:VEGF (349. 8 ± 51. 2 pM) compared with islet/hESC-MSC group and islet group but it was not markedly different from C-peptide levels in normal mice. In intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IP-GTT) to examine glucose responsiveness of the islet graft, mice in islet/hESC-MSC:VEGF group returned to normoglycemic state {{at the same rate as}} normal mice, while mice in islet/hESC-MSC and islet groups responded more slowly and did not return to the normoglycemic state. The results showed improved islet functionality and micro-vessel density in the group of mice received islets with VEGF expressing hESC-MSC, compared with control groups. Conclusion: We conclude that conditional expression of VEGF from hESC-MSCs during islet transplantation could enhance islet functionality and revascularization. This result can be used to improve the outcome of clinical islet transplantation. Keywords:Co-transplantation, Embryonic stem, Mesenchymal stem cells...|$|R

The aim {{of the study was to}} assess if a dairy value chain could be used to distribute a micronutrient-fortified yoghurt (MNFY), to improve hemoglobin concentration and decrease anemia prevalence among preschool children at the individual level, in a remote area in Northern Senegal. <b>Delivery</b> of the MNFY was <b>conditional</b> on regular <b>delivery</b> of milk to the dairy cooperative supplying the MNFY and collecting milk from milk producing households. A cluster randomized control trial was used to compare children 24 to 59 months of age at baseline from households who received the MNFY coupled to a behavior change communication campaign (BCC) focusing on anemia prevention, to children from a control group (receiving BCC only) after one year. Randomization was at the level of the family concession (households from extended family). Households eligible were those having a child of the target age at baseline and willing to deliver milk to the dairy factory. The intervention started in February 2013 and lasted one year. A baseline survey was conducted in January 2013, two follow-up surveys in April and September 2013 and an endline survey in January 2014. Data were collected with questionnaires at the household, maternal and child level, during the baseline and endline surveys.

40|$|This {{research}} {{analyzes the}} factors influencing choice and {{the determinants of}} women's health services demand. Demand for health services in Colombia is practically unexplored, and {{there appear to be}} no studies of demand for health services by women of child rearing age in Colombia. The Colombian National Health Study of 1980 (Estudio Nacional de Salud- 1980) is the data base used, supplemented by hospital data from the Ministry of Health. After a description of the Colombian Health System, the choice between traditional and modern care is studied for prenatal care, and for child's delivery assistance, emphasizing differences among insured and non-insured women. The first part of the study estimates demand schedules through a logistic specification. The choice of institutional setting for child's <b>delivery</b> assistance, <b>conditional</b> upon the prior decision of using modern care, is studied through a nested multinomial logit specification for women in different regions of the country and for urban and rural women as well. Expected prices for a delivery are estimated for all choices women face. Only few recent studies have found demand for modern health services to be price elastic and dependent on income level; this is also the case in some of the regions of Colombia. Moreover, demand for health services becomes less price elastic as income increases. Demand for Private care is generally more price elastic than demand for other types of care, and in some cases demand for Public care is significantly price elastic at lower income levels. Lower income women rely on Public hospitals when they have decided against traditional care. Then, price changes for Public care would have larger welfare effects on lower income groups. Urban women of high income groups often use Public care, indicating that government subsidies are favoring better-off sectors of the population. Meanwhile, rural women rely heavily on home care, even at higher income levels. A more rational price system for services at social security hospitals would not reduce significantly women's welfare; higher prices would help to provide better quality services and/or permit cost recovery for those institutions which very often find themselves in financial trouble...|$|R
