I am interested in finding out how the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief is revealed and what effects <b>of</b> the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief toward the speaker are. In my thesis, I use literary approach. Furthermore, I use the elements of poetry as the tools to reveal the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief and its effects to the speaker. I also use the mythological background as the supporting concept. Through the analysis, I {{found out that the}} <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief is revealed through Proserpine?s figure and through the elements of poetry. I found out that Proserpine is mentioned through paradoxes and symbols in the beginning, {{and the end of the}} poem to reveal the paradoxical role of Proserpine. The speaker uses Proserpine to represent the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief. The <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief is also revealed through the elements of poetry. The use of metaphor of the sea describes the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief and in this sea paganism and Christianity rise and sink by turns. The use of simile describes the situation of the people and the gods in the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief and the power <b>of</b> the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief. The speaker also describes how the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> belief happens through the dictions, and he uses allusion, symbol and paradox to describe pagan gods, Christ, and Mary. I found that the transition from ancient Rome to Christianity has brought some effects to the speaker. He experiences loss and sadness. In his pain, he reproaches Christ and Mary and shows his refusal toward Christ. Through this analysis, I learn that a change is not always an improvement to all people in society...|$|R

The study suggested that dodos bred around August, after having potentially fattened themselves, corresponding with the fat and thin <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> many vertebrates of Mauritius. The chicks grew rapidly, reaching robust, almost adult, sizes, and sexual maturity before Austral summer or the cyclone season. Adult dodos which had just bred moulted after Austral summer, around March. The feathers of the wings and tail were replaced first, and the moulting would have completed {{at the end of}} July, in time for the next breeding season. Different stages of moulting may also account for inconsistencies in contemporary descriptions of dodo plumage.|$|E
5|$|A test in 2001 {{showed that}} four jumping species take nectar, either by sucking free nectar {{from the surface}} of flowers or biting the flowers with their fangs. The spiders fed in <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> two to four minutes, then groomed their bodies and {{especially}} their chelicerae, before another cycle. A more formal part of the test showed that 90juvenile jumping spiders, including P. fimbriata, generally prefer to suck from blotting soaked with a 30% solution of sugar rather than paper soaked with distilled water. The authors suggest that, in the wild, nectar may be a frequent, convenient way to get some nutrients, as it would avoid the work, risks and costs (such as making venom) of predation. Jumping spiders may benefit from amino acids, lipids, vitamins and minerals normally found in nectar.|$|E
5|$|Although much reduced, a {{significant}} Maya presence remained into the Postclassic period after {{the abandonment of}} the major Classic period cities; the population was particularly concentrated near permanent water sources. Unlike during previous <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> contraction in the Maya region, abandoned lands were not quickly resettled in the Postclassic. Activity shifted to the northern lowlands and the Maya Highlands; this may have involved migration from the southern lowlands, because many Postclassic Maya groups had migration myths. Chichen Itza and its Puuc neighbours declined dramatically in the 11th century, and this may represent the final episode of Classic Period collapse. After the decline of Chichen Itza, the Maya region lacked a dominant power until {{the rise of the}} city of Mayapan in the 12th century.
