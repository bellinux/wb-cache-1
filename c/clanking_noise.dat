60|$|Mr. Chalk, {{trembling}} violently, {{tried to}} speak, but in vain. A horrid <b>clanking</b> <b>noise</b> sounded overhead, {{and with the}} desperation of terror he turned into the new cabin and, collecting his weapons, began with frantic haste to load them. Then he dropped his rifle and sprang forward with a loud cry as he heard the door close smartly and the key turn in the lock.|$|E
60|$|This {{might have}} lasted half a minute, or a minute, {{but it seemed}} an hour. The bells ceased, as they had begun, together. They were succeeded by a <b>clanking</b> <b>noise,</b> deep down below, as if some person were {{dragging}} a heavy chain over the casks in the wine merchant's cellar. Scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains.|$|E
60|$|His {{attention}} was suddenly attracted by a clanking sound--he {{knew what it}} was, for he had startled himself by making the same noise in walking to the door. Presently a voice began to sing, {{and he saw the}} shadow of a figure on the pavement. It stopped--was silent all at once, as though the person for a moment had forgotten where he was, but soon remembered--and so, with the same <b>clanking</b> <b>noise,</b> the shadow disappeared.|$|E
60|$|Mr Bloom {{passed on}} out of the <b>clanking</b> <b>noises</b> through the gallery on to the landing. Now am I going to tram it out {{all the way and}} then catch him out perhaps. Better phone him up first. Number? Yes. Same as Citron's house. Twentyeight. Twentyeight double four.|$|R
5000|$|Steiner always wears a full suit {{of heavy}} armour {{throughout}} the game, {{giving him a}} bulky appearance that is more silly than menacing. <b>Clanking</b> <b>noises</b> accompany his footsteps and his frequent fits of pique, in which he hops up and down to express his anger. His armour is often remarked on by others, such as when Zidane refers to him as [...] "Rusty" [...] early in the game. Steiner only seems to mind this once (though his armour never actually appears damaged or ill-maintained).|$|R
5000|$|The {{story begins}} when Mr Otis and family move into Canterville Chase, despite {{warnings}} from Lord Canterville {{that the house}} is haunted. Mr Otis says that he will take the furniture {{as well as the}} ghost at valuation. The Otis family includes Mr and Mrs Otis, their eldest son Washington, their daughter Virginia and the Otis twins. The other characters include the Canterville Ghost, the Duke of Cheshire (who wants to marry Virginia), Mrs Umney (the housekeeper), and Rev. Augustus Dampier. At first, none of the Otis family believe in ghosts, but shortly after they move in, none of them can deny the presence of Sir Simon de Canterville [...] The family hears clanking chains, they witness reappearing bloodstains [...] "on the floor just by the fireplace", which are removed every time they appear in various forms. But, humorously, none of these scare the Otis family in the least. In fact, upon hearing the <b>clanking</b> <b>noises</b> in the hallway, Mr Otis promptly gets out of bed and pragmatically offers the ghost Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator to oil his chains.|$|R
5000|$|Collie's {{account was}} {{reported}} in the local press and followed by a correspondence on the subject. Norman G. Forbes reported that he had heard a mysterious <b>clanking</b> <b>noise</b> while climbing Braeriach in summer mist. It proved to be two deer. He noted that the Cairngorms “have an uncanny power of inducing a feeling of eeriness” and [...] "the mind, alone in lonely places, creates many things out of its imagining" [...]|$|E
5000|$|When {{they get}} to the hotel, Eirik soon discovers that the place is deserted. He breaks in through a window and unlocks a door, then Mikal and Jannicke proceed to lay Morten down on a couch in the parlor. They then treat the broken leg with alcohol and superglue. Eirik, Mikal and Ingunn later go to explore the {{abandoned}} resort, while Jannicke stays to keep Morten company. The three discover the electric generator of the hotel. Eirik fixes the generator and power is restored to the resort. Afterwards, Mikal and Ingunn run off by themselves. While exploring the various hotel suites, they discover a room in particular disarray with the window broken, and Ingunn is slightly shocked to find blood and small amounts of hair on a glass shard. Eirik, {{on his way back to}} the parlor, hears a <b>clanking</b> <b>noise</b> from deeper down in the cellar, and assumes it's Mikal and Ingunn. He calls for them to be more careful, but he receives no reply. With the lights back on, music playing and plentiful amounts of food and alcohol, the group are all quite content and have a great time in the parlor. Jannicke finds the hotel's guestbook and discovers that the last guest checked in some time during 1975, and under the names of the last registered guests, there is a message reading [...] "We hope you find your son". Inside the book, there is a picture of a family. And the boy is the same one who was being chased and buried in snow during the opening sequence.|$|E
