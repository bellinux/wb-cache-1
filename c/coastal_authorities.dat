40|$|Many of Australia’s iconic {{sandy beaches}} are already under {{pressure}} due to coastal {{development and the}} impacts of severe storm or flood events. These impacts {{are likely to be}} exacerbated by projected climate changes such as elevated water levels and potentially increased storm intensity. Beaches provide important recreation services for both residents and tourists but few studies in Australia have attempted to place economic values on this service. Thus, <b>coastal</b> <b>authorities</b> that are forced to make investment decisions relating to beach protection and restoration have insufficient data to conduct cost-benefit evaluations of projects where recreation values are significant. This paper reports on a series of beach recreation surveys that were conducted as part of the national Beach and Surf Tourism and Recreation in Australia: Vulnerability and Adaptation project. Residents and tourists were surveyed in four case study locations, Sunshine Coast (Qld), Clarence Valley (NSW), Augusta-Margaret River (WA) and Surf Coast (Vic) chosen to represent different levels of development, geomorphology and vulnerability. The data was analysed using both the travel cost method and expenditure analysis to estimate recreation and tourism values respectively...|$|E

40|$|Globally, marine turtle {{populations have}} {{declined}} sharply from historic estimates. Rapid changes to turtle nesting habitats, caused by accelerating coastal development and beach erosion, pose new threats to these iconic species in Australia and worldwide. Marine turtles nest in coastal dunes where a key risk factor is nest loss from erosion and inundation– this makes selection of nests sites by turtles critical in predicting their future nesting success. Yet, the precise factors determining nest site selection remain largely unknown. The {{aim of this}} project is to model nesting success in relation to local and regional geomorphic features obtained at unmatched accuracy and resolution using novel surveying techniques. In order achieve this, beach and dune geomorphology will be surveyed immediately after a nest location is identified by the extensive network of a local volunteer group that undertake daily beach surveys during turtle nesting season in the Sunshine Coast. Rapid 3 D beach surveying {{will be based on}} remotely-sensed images collected from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV/drones) and processed using cost-effective close-range photogrammetric techniques. The data collection will extend seamlessly from the dunes into the surf zone. Importantly, the outcomes of this project will enhance and improve species conservation outcomes by identifying critical landscape features that can be actively managed, restored, protected and monitored by <b>coastal</b> <b>authorities...</b>|$|E
40|$|Within today's {{security}} {{environment and}} with increasing worldwide travel and transport of dangerous goods {{the need of}} vessel traffic services, ship routing and monitoring of ship movements on sea and along coastlines becomes more time consuming and an important responsibility for <b>coastal</b> <b>authorities.</b> This paper describes the architecture of a ship detection prototype based on an object-oriented methodology to support these monitoring tasks. The system’s architecture comprises a fully-automatic coastline detection tool, a tool for fully or semi-automatic ship detection in off-shore areas and a semi-automatic tool for ship detection within harbour-areas. Its core {{is based on the}} client-server environment of the first object-oriented image analysis software on the market named eCognition. The described ship detection system has been developed for panchromatic VHR satellite image data and has proven its capabilities on Ikonos and QuickBird imagery under different weather conditions and for various regions of the world. With the capability of eCognition to combine raster data with imported thematic data it is possible to work with available non-remote sensing based data e. g. detailed harbour GIS information in ESRI shape file format or weather information, which can be attached to the results. Finally the system’s ability of generating customized reports in HTML format and the possibility of exporting results in standard raster or vector format offers new opportunities in the direction of an interoperability of technology where a great number of heterogeneous networks and operators are involved in the surveillance process. 1...|$|E
40|$|Managing hazards {{associated}} with shoreline responses to extreme {{events and the}} provision of safe boating access is an ongoing concern for <b>coastal</b> <b>authorities.</b> The open sandy coastline of Gold Coast city is a wave dominated coast with a highly variable wave climate and a narrow continental shelf thus experiencing substantial variations in long-shore transport rates. Detailed wave transformation information is central to further investigations of sediment transport processes as complex bathymetry {{associated with}} trained river entrances and rocky headlands causes localised interruptions to the overall northward littoral drift. Temporal variations in wave energy are driven by a wide range of swell direction and size while spatial variations occur {{as a result of the}} strong refraction during particular swell events. This paper presents a comparison of two near shore wave models of the region using MIKE 21 and SWAN. The transformation of waves arriving from offshore is simulated using the models for selected time series of wave parameters. The parameterized boundary conditions are derived from NOAA Wave Watch III global wave model data. Model output is compared with observed data from existing wave recording buoys at Gold Coast Seaway and Point Lookout. The inclusion of wind in the modelling undertaken did not improve the models' accuracy and winds in excess of 10 ms- 1 led to an over-estimation of significant wave height while increasing the processing time. Sheltering of the near-shore site during southerly swell conditions was well-represented by the modelling. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EnvironmentFull Tex...|$|E

40|$|Shore nourishments are {{regarded}} as an almost routine coastal protection measure and {{have been carried out}} worldwide for several decades. Recent studies generally conclude that “soft” coastal protection measures are an effective option for a sustainable coastal management. However, more research on economic sustainability, species-specific habitat demands and availability of sand deposits is required. Nowadays, the recent paradigm shifts to concepts like the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) and the Ecosystem Approach to Management (EAM). For the German Wadden Sea these management objectives are an important issue of the “Wattenmeerstrategie 2100 ”, a political strategy report that demands an adaption against the global change and the expected sea-level rise up to the year 2100. Hence, also new concepts and tools for the implementation of more sustainable, effective and environment-friendly shore nourishments are needed. The research project STENCIL joins the expertise of coastal engineers, geologists, biologists and toxicologists {{in order to make a}} first step towards the long-term goal of establishing an ICZM and EAM for shore nourishments in the German Wadden Sea. The project focuses on providing improved tools, models and methods for the prediction of coastal hydro- and morphodynamics. Furthermore, the impact of dredging and dumping activities on benthic habitats and their natural regeneration potentials will be evaluated. Since these impacts are still widely uninvestigated, monitoring of dredging areas and the surrounding sites using hydroacoustic devices, aerial photos and sediment samples for grain-size and benthos analysis remains of high importance. In order to develop standardized operative observation methods, analysis and decision-supporting tools, an implementation of field measurements, laboratory experiments as well as conceptual and numerical models is planned. These combined approaches will result in valuable data sets for habitat evaluation, improved prediction methods as well as process and work-flow studies. Finally, a strategy for future planning and monitoring of shore nourishment projects will be established in close cooperation with the <b>coastal</b> <b>authorities.</b> STENCIL has recently started in October 2016 within the research program “Research for sustainable development” (FONA) of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).
