Although hesitant, Mahone agrees when an operative of the Company, Agent Kim (Reggie Lee), threatens to murder his family. Mahone <b>continues</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunt</b> for the remaining six escapees but is betrayed and shot by Kellerman, who transfers his allegiance to the brothers.

Sam meets Alan first in the Season 2 premiere, [...] "A New Hope," [...] during a reap to capture 40 {{fighting}} souls in a warehouse. After being knocked unconscious by Alan, Sam <b>continues</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunt</b> for him in [...] "Dirty Sexy Mongol" [...] and tracks him down to an apartment. He tries to solicit Alan's help, but two demons, sent by The Devil, attack Sam at the gate. Scared that he'll return to Hell, Alan leaves his apartment. Sam and Andi find out that Alan's been trying to stay off The Devil's radar by avoiding all temptation. Alan accepts a job offer as a gravedigger and takes refuge at a cemetery after being informed that the grounds have been consecrated and thus untouchable by the Devil and other demons. Sam and the others corner him at the cemetery and, since Alan was a gambling addict, attempt to bribe him with horse-racing tickets for the information. Alan eventually buys into a trip to Vatican City and tells Sam {{that he needs to}} challenge and beat The Devil (Alan beat The Devil in a game of poker). He promises to tell Sam how to make The Devil agree to the challenge after landing. As he is on a plane toward Vatican City, the Devil diverts the plane to Las Vegas and gives him 100 dollars in casino chips. Later, the Devil tells Sam that he took Alan back to Hell after he started gambling again; Alan's deal with the Devil was that if he sinned again he would return to Hell, and gambling was a sin.|$|E

5000|$|While {{there were}} new faces {{for the third}} season, much of the cast carried over from the {{previous}} year. Actor Jim Beaver returned as hunter Bobby Singer, and felt the character had grown into a surrogate father for Sam and Dean. Richard Speight, Jr. returned as the Trickster in [...] "Mystery Spot", as did Travis Wester and A. J. Buckley in [...] "Ghostfacers" [...] as Harry Spangler and Ed Zeddmore. Portraying [...] "bumbling versions" [...] of the Winchesters, Wester and Buckley improvised many of their lines. The writers also considered bringing back Charles Malik Whitfield for a recurring role, with his character, FBI Agent Victor Henriksen, <b>continues</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunt</b> for the brothers throughout the season. Whitfield stated his willingness to relocate to Vancouver, but the writers ultimately went a different direction. Because the threat of being captured by Henriksen looms over the Winchesters all season, the writers wanted to bring the plotline to a close in [...] "Jus in Bello". Kripke suggested that Gamble develop and deepen his character, [...] "give him a great send off, and then kill him...or at least...mostly kill him". With the character last seen being confronted by the demon Lilith, Gamble noted that Agent Henriksen's fate was left ambiguous, and that she herself was uncertain.|$|E

50|$|First {{learning}} about the ginseng of Tartary (i.e. Northern China) from {{the writings of the}} Jesuit missionary Pierre Jartoux, Lafitau surmised that the conditions in North America would be favorable to the plant.

Encouraged by the Iroquois to <b>continue</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunt,</b> a Mohawk woman whom Lafitau had hired to find the plant recognized it as one of the common remedies of the Iroquois.Lafitau quickly sent for Jartoux’s publication and description to identify the plant from the plate. In his discovery, Lafitau was the first to employ botanical plates in the field in order to gain information from Natives. His published report the Mémoire...concernant la précieuse plante du gin-seng in 1718 set off a hunt by market collectors who exported ginseng to China via France. Mémoire...concernant la précieuse plante du gin-seng has never been translated into English.|$|R
5000|$|Blake and Nobody travel west, {{leaving a}} trail of dead and encountering wanted posters announcing higher and higher bounties for Blake's death or capture. Blake learns of Nobody's past, marked both by Native American and white racism; it is {{detailed}} that he is the product of lovers from two opposing tribes, and how as a child he was abducted by English soldiers and brought to Europe as a model savage. He was briefly educated and learned of the proper William Blake's art and poetry before returning home, where his stories of the white man and his culture were laughed off by fellow Native Americans. He gained his name, Nobody, at this point, the literal translation of which is revealed to be [...] "He who talks loud, saying nothing". Nobody leaves Blake alone in the wild when he decides Blake must undergo a vision quest. On his quest, Blake kills two U.S. Marshals, experiences visions of nature spirits, and grieves over the remains of a dead fawn that was killed accidentally by his pursuers. He paints his face with the fawn's blood and rejoins Nobody on their journey. Meanwhile, the most ferocious member of the bounty hunter posse, Cole Wilson, has killed his comrades (eating one of them) and <b>continued</b> <b>his</b> <b>hunt</b> alone.|$|R

His leg breaks during the disposal of a victim's body, and he is forced to attach a metal rod to support his ankle. Mark also begins to lose his grip on reality and suffers from hallucinations. His decomposition becomes so severe that he can no longer bear to look at himself, so he overdoses with a bottle of chloroform.|$|R

5000|$|Luke's final flight {{took place}} during {{the first phase of the}} Meuse-Argonne Offensive. On September 28, after {{achieving}} his 14th and 15th victories, he landed his SPAD XIII at the French aerodrome at Cicognes where he spent the night, claiming engine trouble. When he returned to the 1st Pursuit Group's base at Rembercourt the next day, he was confronted by Lt. Grant, his squadron's commanding officer (C.O.). Despite being under threat of arrest by Grant for being AWOL, Luke took off without authorization and flew to a forward airbase at Verdun, where his sympathetic group commander, Major Hartney, canceled the arrest order and gave Luke tacit approval to <b>continue</b> <b>his</b> balloon <b>hunting.</b> That evening Luke flew to the front to attack three balloons in the vicinity of Dun-sur-Meuse, six miles behind the German lines. He first dropped a message to a nearby U.S. balloon company, alerting them to observe his imminent attacks. Luke shot down the enemy balloons, but was then severely wounded by a single machine gun bullet fired from a hilltop above him, a mile east of the last balloon site he had attacked. Luke landed in a field just west of the small village of Murvaux—after strafing a group of German soldiers on the ground—near the Ruisseau de Bradon, a stream leading to the Meuse River. Although weakened by his wound, he made his way toward the stream, intending to reach the cover of its adjacent underbrush, but finally collapsed some 200 meters from his airplane. Approached by German infantry, Luke drew his Colt Model 1911 pistol and fired a few rounds at his attackers before dying. Reports that a day later his body was found with an empty gun and a bullet hole in his chest, with seven dead Germans in front of him were proven erroneous. [...] According to author Skinner, the fatal bullet, fired from the hilltop machine gun position, had entered near Luke's right shoulder, passed through his body, and exited from his left side.|$|R

50|$|Over {{the next}} few months, Todd murders several {{homeless}} vagrants; he finds that committing murder somehow helps with his nightmares. As years pass, Todd's visits to Dussander become less frequent. He loses his virginity, but finds sex unsatisfying compared to the thrill of murdering local derelicts. He rationalizes that his failure at sex is because his girlfriend is Jewish. When circumstances do not allow him to <b>continue</b> <b>his</b> serial killings, he picks a concealed spot overlooking the freeway and aims at people in passing cars with <b>his</b> <b>hunting</b> rifle. Dussander, suffering from his own nightmares, has also taken to killing the homeless for essentially the same reason as Todd, burying the bodies in his basement. Despite the link between them, Dussander and Todd are not immediately aware of each other's exploits.|$|R
