40|$|The {{evolutionary}} processes at play between {{island and}} mainland {{populations of the}} malaria mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto are of great interest as islands may be suitable sites for preliminary application of transgenic-based vector control strategies. Sao Tome and Principe, located off the West African coast, have received such attention in recent years. This study investigates the degree of isolation of An. gambiae s. s. populations between these islands and the mainland based on mitochondrial and ribosomal DNA molecular data. We identify possible continental localities from which these island populations derived. For these purposes, we used F-ST values, haplotype networks, and nested clade analysis to estimate migration rates and patterns. Haplotypes from both markers are geographically widespread across the African continent. Results indicate that the populations from Sao Tome and Principe are relatively isolated from continental African populations, suggesting they are promising sites for test releases of transgenic individuals. These island populations are possibly derived from two separate <b>continental</b> <b>migrations.</b> This result is discussed {{in the context of}} the history of the African slave trade with respect to Sao Tome and Principe...|$|R

A {{few studies have}} examined some of these data for specific localities during certain times of the year; however, no attempt has been made to examine the total recovery data to compile a general picture of <b>continental</b> movement and <b>migration</b> patterns. Increasing attention is being given to blackbird (Icteridae) and Starling (Sturnus vulgaris) populations in North America because of their reported crop depredations, health hazards, and nuisance aspects, especially when congregating in large roosts (Meanley, 1975;Graham, 1976). Solutions to these problems are difficult to find because the problems are widespread and the populations are highly mobile. Management measures necessary in one area may have effects in areas far removed. Thus, effective management requires a thorough knowledge of the overall movement and migration pattern of each species. The objectives of this study are to: (1) determine the general <b>continental</b> movement and <b>migration</b> patterns of the Red-wing during the annual cycle, and (2) examine banding and recovery numbers in relation to population numbers on a regional basis to pinpoint areas where additional banding and/or recovery effort is needed...|$|R

Changes in lithospheric composition may have also contributed to differences in subduction geometry.

However, in the second episode of subduction, it was instead Ionian oceanic lithosphere that was involved in subduction. A transition from continental to oceanic lithosphere subduction could explain the late onset of arc volcanism (2-1.5 Ma) as well as the lack of arc volcanism in the central Tyrrhenian basin.|$|R

40|$|This {{integrated}} study (field observations, micropalaeontology, magnetostratigraphy, geochemistry, borehole {{data and}} seismic profiles) of the Messinian–Zanclean deposits on Zakynthos Island (Ionian Sea) {{focuses on the}} sedimentary succession recording the pre-evaporitic phase of the Messinian salinity crisis (MSC) through the re-establishment of the marine conditions in a transitional area between the eastern and the western Mediterranean. Two intervals are distinguished through the palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of the pre-evaporitic Messinian in Kalamaki: (a) 6. 45 – 6. 122  Ma and (b) 6. 122 – 5. 97  Ma. Both the planktonic foraminifer and the fish assemblages indicate a cooling phase punctuated by hypersalinity episodes at around 6. 05  Ma. Two evaporite units are recognized and associated with the tectonic evolution of the Kalamaki–Argassi area. The Primary Lower Gypsum (PLG) unit was deposited during the first MSC stage (5. 971 – 5. 60  Ma) in late-Messinian marginal basins within the pre-Apulian foreland basin and in the wedge-top (< 300  m) developed over the Ionian zone. During the second MSC stage (5. 60 – 5. 55  Ma), the PLG evaporites were deeply eroded in the forebulge–backbulge and the wedge-top areas, and supplied the foreland basin's depocentre with gypsum turbidites assigned to the Resedimented Lower Gypsum (RLG) unit. In this study, we propose a simple model for the Neogene–Pliocene <b>continental</b> foreland-directed <b>migration</b> of the Hellenide thrusting, which explains the palaeogeography of the Zakynthos basin.

40|$|The {{controversial}} {{problem of}} biotic crises is considered {{in relation to}} the Cretaceous – Tertiary and Permian – Triassic transboundary events in the non-marine sequence of Far East and the Russian platform, respectively. In both cases, the floristic changes across the critical boundaries proceeded in few steps, none of which indicated a catastrophic destruction of plant communities.

Neither the end-Permian“fungal spike”, nor the end-Cretaceous “fern spike ” are supported by paleobotanical evidence. Incidentally, an increase of ferns in the transboundary plant-bearing sequences can be explained, upon the recent examples, by the rapid fern growth on the ash fallouts. A model of biotic crises is proposed, in which the intracratonic rifting and trap magmatism are causally related to the rise/spheric expansion of continental crust.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} oxygen isotope values of biogenic apatite for tracking freshwater to marine migration in modem and fossil Pacific sockeye salmon. Oxygen isotope analyses of otoliths, vertebrae, and teeth of three anadromous modem sockeye salmon from Alaska establish {{a basis for the}} interpretation of fossil vertebrae and tooth apatite from Pleistocene sockeye salmon of the Skokomish River Valley, Washington. High resolution delta O- 18 profiles in salmon otoliths provide, at a monthly resolution, a detailed record of individual history including <b>continental</b> rearing, <b>migration</b> to sea, seasonal variation in sea surface temperatures during marine life, and spawning migration before capture. Pacific salmon teeth are constantly renewed with the last set of teeth forming under the influence of freshwater. Therefore, they do not allow inference concerning sea-run versus landlocked life history in fossil salmon. Salmon vertebrae are also ambiguous indicators of life history regarding fresh versus marine water because centra are minimally ossified in the freshwater stages of life and the outermost layer of vertebral bone might be resorbed to provide nutrients during the non-feeding phase of the spawning migration. Therefore, delta O- 18 values of accretionary growth rings in sea-run salmon vertebrae are dominated by the marine signal only if they are not diagenetically altered in freshwater deposits. In Pleistocene sockeye reported here, neither the teeth nor vertebral apatite present clear marine delta O- 18 values due to the combined effects of tooth replacement and diagenetic alteration of bone and dentine. delta O- 18 (PO 4) values of fossil vertebrae are intermediate between delta O- 18 (PO 4) values of enamel and basal tooth dentin. Assuming a similar rate of isotope exchange of vertebrae and dentine with freshwater during diagenesis, these results are interpreted to reflect formation of the teeth under the influence of freshwater, and formation of the vertebrae under the influence of oceanic water. Our approach demonstrates that when appropriate knowledge of tissue formation is available, isotopic differences between altered and unaltered tissue holds promise of distinguishing between marine and freshwater origin of the tissues.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the genetic {{prehistory}} of Sardinia because of the scarcity of pre-Neolithic human remains. From a genetic perspective, modern Sardinians are known as genetic outliers in Europe, showing unusually high levels of internal diversity and a close relationship to early European Neolithic farmers.

Here we present the first and oldest complete mitochondrial sequences from Sardinia, dated back to 10, 000 yBP. These two individuals, while confirming a Mesolithic occupation of the island, belong to rare mtDNA lineages, which have never been found before in Mesolithic samples and that are currently present at low frequencies not only in Sardinia, but in the whole Europe. Preliminary Approximate Bayesian Computations, restricted by biased reference samples for Mesolithic Sardinia (the two typed samples) and Neolithic Europe (limited to central and north European sequences), suggest that the first inhabitants of the island have had a small or negligible contribution to the present-day Sardinian population, which mainly derives its genetic diversity from <b>continental</b> <b>migration</b> into the island by Neolithic times...|$|E

Indeed, contemporary and early modern concerns over these matters have extended interests in Thomas Malthus. Yet, despite extensive research on population issues, little work explicates the genesis of population knowledge production or how the process of intellectual transfer occurred during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. This paper examines the Delessert network’s instrumental role in cultivating, curating, and circulating knowledge that popularized Malthusian population theory, including the theory’s constitutive elements of political economy, philanthropy, industry, agriculture, and botany. I show how deviant, nonconformist groups suffered forced migration for their political philosophy, particularly during the revolutionary 1790 s, resulting in their imprisonment and migration to America.

By focusing on the Delesserts and their social network, I find that a byproduct of inter and intra <b>continental</b> <b>migration</b> among European elites was a knowledge exchange that stimulated Malthus’s thesis on population and Genevan Augustin Pyramus Candolle’s research on botany, ultimately culminating in Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection and human evolution...|$|E
40|$|Migration {{plays an}} {{important}} role in development and as a strategy for poverty reduction. Burkina Faso, a country where conditions for agriculture are far from favourable, has a long history of migratory movement. Migration within West Africa (<b>continental</b> <b>migration)</b> has since long taken place in response to drought and low agricultural productivity. Migration to destinations outside the African continent and in particular to Western Europe (intercontinental migration) has become more important over the last decades for migrants from Burkina Faso. This study provides a quantitative analysis of the determinants and effects of migration for rural households in four villages on the Central Plateau of Burkina Faso. It sheds new light on the migration-remittances-development debate by analysing migration from a whole-household perspective combining determinants and consequences of migration; by including both the production and the consumption side of the rural household economy in an imperfect market environment; and by allowing for heterogeneity in migration through a distinction of two different migratory movements: continental and intercontinental migration. An extended farm household model that includes a migration component forms the basis of the econometric analysis of cross-section data from 223 households. Findings reveal that the two migratory movements are indeed different strategic decisions. Households with intercontinental migrants are able to overcome entry constraints that exist for this more lucrative (in terms of remittances) form of migration because of their wealth. In an imperfect market environment remittances from intercontinental migration help these households to overcome entry constraints existing for other activities and to greatly improve their welfare. Continental migrants appear to be pushed out due to insufficient land and consumption pressure. Loss of labour negatively influences income generated in labour-intensive activities and household welfare only slightly improves due to the migration induced reduction in household size...|$|E

40|$|The broad-scale {{reductions}} and shifts {{that may be}} expected under climate change in the availability and quality of stopover habitat for long-distance migrants {{is an area of}} increasing concern for conservation biologists. Researchers generally have taken two broad approaches to the modeling of migration behaviour to understand the impact of these changes on migratory bird populations. These include models based on causal processes and their response to environmental stimulation, "mechanistic models", or models that primarily are based on observed animal distribution patterns and the correlation of these patterns with environmental variables, i. e. "data driven" models. Investigators have applied the latter technique to forecast changes in migration patterns with changes in the environment, for example, as might be expected under climate change, by forecasting how the underlying environmental data layers upon which the relationships are built will change over time. The learned geostatstical correlations are then applied to the modified data layers [...] However, this is problematic. Even if the projections of how the underlying data layers will change are correct, it is not evident that the statistical relationships will remain the same, i. e. that the animal organism may not adapt its' behaviour to the changing conditions. Mechanistic models that explicitly take into account the physical, biological, and behaviour responses of an organism as well as the underlying changes in the landscape offer an alternative to address these shortcomings. The availability of satellite remote sensing observations at multiple spatial and temporal scales, coupled with advances in climate modeling and information technologies enable the application of the mechanistic models to predict how <b>continental</b> bird <b>migration</b> patterns may change in response to environmental change. In earlier work, we simulated the impact of effects of wetland loss and inter-annual variability on the fitness of migratory shorebirds in the central fly ways of North America.

With the advent of new computing capabilities enabled hy recent GPU-GP computing paradigms and commodity hardware, it now is possible to simulate both larger ensemble populations and to incorporate more realistic mechanistic factors into migration models.

A recent World Bank investigation finds a significant positive relationship between international migration and poverty reduction at the country level (Adams and Page 2003). Burkina Faso, whose conditions for agriculture are far from favorable, has a long history of migratory movement, and migration within West Africa has long taken place in response to drought and low agricultural productivity. In recent decades, migration to destinations outside the African continent and in particular to Western Europe has become more important for migrants from Burkina Faso. Migration can be considered a livelihood diversification strategy because remittances resulting from migration constitute an income source that is uncorrelated with household income from agriculture. Migration affects the sending household in three ways. First, when a household member migrates, the household loses labor. Second, migration often results in remittances.

40|$|Though {{many studies}} {{address the issue}} of {{immigrants}} in schools, relatively little research attention has been given to the education experience of immigrants who have migrated from one developing country to another (or "South-South" migration), although this accounts for about half of all migration worldwide. The studies that do exist in this realm tend to focus on the classroom experience of immigrant students without due consideration of the policy context that influences the immigrant students' school experience. Consequently, although we are learning more about immigrant student experiences in classrooms in developing countries, to date, we lack information about the policy context in which educational stakeholders in developing countries find themselves when attempting to incorporate immigrant students into an education system that, more often than not, is struggling with issues of poverty and lack of resources. This is especially true in the African context where <b>continental</b> <b>migration</b> rates continue to increase yet immigration education policies tend to be unclear, if not altogether absent. Using the case of South Africa, an African country beset by xenophobia [...] most notably, the infamous xenophobic riots of 2008, this exploratory baseline sociological study sought to document how the social context of a developing country nfluences educational policy implementation and interpretation with regard to access for immigrant students. This qualitative study, which took place from December 2010 to November 2011, employed semi-structured interviews with 17 educational stakeholders at both the meso and the micro organizational levels of the educational bureaucracy as well as NGOs to better understand how policy was interpreted and implemented for immigrant students. Additionally, this study employed a reviewof existing policy documents as well as a qualitative case study using tenets of ethnographic observation. Data analysis for this study employed methods of themed coding and frequency identification. The data analysis revealed little consensus on how education policy regarding access for immigrant students should be applied, leading to disparate understandings and lack of access for some immigrant students depending on country of origin. The data also revealed that immigrant education policy interpretation was heavily influenced not only by organizational type and role, but personal experience of the actor as well. Additionally, the findings indicated that the role of the principal was paramount in how education policy was applied in schools, and because of the policy confusion, principals in some cases were able to employ innovative methods to obtain resources that aided the immigrant learners in their school. The findings also revealed that although xenophobia does exist in the South African socio-cultural fabric, it was not the primary determinant used to grant or deny access to immigrant students. The institution of South African schooling, centered around success on a final qualifying exam, emerged as the driver of educational stakeholder policy interpretation and implementation regarding immigrant student access.

5|$|In the Oligocene, from twenty-five to thirty-two {{million years}} ago, {{there was another}} {{significant}} restructuring of the global carbon cycle as grasses evolved a new mechanism of photosynthesis, C4 photosynthesis, and expanded their ranges.

The relative abundance and distribution of biodiversity alters the dynamics between organisms and their environment such that ecosystems can be both cause and effect in relation to climate change. Human-driven modifications to the planet's ecosystems (e.g., disturbance, biodiversity loss, agriculture) contributes to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas levels. Transformation of the global carbon cycle in the next century is projected to raise planetary temperatures, lead to more extreme fluctuations in weather, alter species distributions, and increase extinction rates. The effect of global warming is already being registered in melting glaciers, melting mountain ice caps, and rising sea levels.

40|$|We develop {{methods to}} {{incorporate}} paleogeographical constraints into numerical models of mantle convection. Through {{the solution of}} the convection equations, the models honor geophysical and geological data near the surface while predicting mantle flow and structure at depth and associated surface deformation. The methods consist of four constraints determined a priori from a plate history model: (1) plate velocities, (2) thermal structure of the lithosphere, (3) thermal structure of slabs in the upper mantle, and (4) velocity of slabs in the upper mantle. These constraints are implemented as temporally- and spatially-dependent conditions that are blended with {{the solution of the}} convection equations at each time step. We construct Earth-like regional models with oceanic and <b>continental</b> lithosphere, trench <b>migration,</b> oblique subduction, and asymmetric subduction to test the robustness of the methods by computing the temperature, velocity, and buoyancy flux of the lithosphere and slab. Full sphere convection models demonstrate how the methods can determine the flow associated with specific tectonic environments (e. g., back-arc basins, intraoceanic subduction zones) to address geological questions and compare with independent data, both at present-day and in the geological past (e. g., seismology, residual topography, stratigraphy). Using global models with paleogeographical constraints we demonstrate (1) subduction initiation at the Izu-Bonin-Mariana convergent margin and flat slab subduction beneath North America, (2) enhanced correlation of model slabs and fast anomalies in seismic tomography beneath North and South America, and (3) comparable amplitude of dynamic and residual topography in addition to improved spatial correlation of dynamic and residual topography lows...|$|R
50|$|In the Oligocene, from twenty-five to thirty-two {{million years}} ago, {{there was another}} {{significant}} restructuring of the global carbon cycle as grasses evolved a new mechanism of photosynthesis, C4 photosynthesis, and expanded their ranges. This new pathway evolved {{in response to the}} drop in atmospheric CO2 concentrations below 550 ppm. The relative abundance and distribution of biodiversity alters the dynamics between organisms and their environment such that ecosystems can be both cause and effect in relation to climate change. Human-driven modifications to the planet's ecosystems (e.g., disturbance, biodiversity loss, agriculture) contributes to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas levels. Transformation of the global carbon cycle in the next century is projected to raise planetary temperatures, lead to more extreme fluctuations in weather, alter species distributions, and increase extinction rates. The effect of global warming is already being registered in melting glaciers, melting mountain ice caps, and rising sea levels. Consequently, species distributions are changing along waterfronts and in <b>continental</b> areas where <b>migration</b> patterns and breeding grounds are tracking the prevailing shifts in climate. Large sections of permafrost are also melting to create a new mosaic of flooded areas having increased rates of soil decomposition activity that raises methane (CH4) emissions.

40|$|The present paper uses a {{transnational}} {{perspective of}} migration as an interpretation scheme {{for analysis of}} current migration flow of fellow countrymen from six Czech villages in Banat Mountain, Romania. This new reading of global people movement is an emancipated approach increasingly prominent in anthropology since the late 1980 s. It is redefinition of perception of place, identities, belonging and space. I  try to argue, {{that it is not}} useful to speak about migration of fellow countrymen as a reemigration, or re-migration, because this reading of their return to homeland, does not show the cultural differences between the fellow countrymen and current Czech society. Is useless to refer them as a lost branch of Czech nation, because the living situation of fellow countrymen after return to homeland does not help comprehending of their ways how they dodge adaptation and integration in host society, mean Czech Republic. This essay is case study of the process entering of six Czech communities of small mountain villages in Romania to transnational space. The reason of transformation their identity from national belonging to deterritorialization form of belonging is because of trade interest in Etno-ruraltourism. The case of transnational tourism trade is an example, how they create hybrid, fluid identities, absorb cultural patterns from two or more location into transnational migration network, and how they use contemporary communication technologies as internet, mobile phones or accelerated transport among points of migration chain. This paper could be a  discursive reflection of contemporary perception of conceptualization of the term diaspora. I comprehend this term in this paper subsequently. The word diaspora has crept into social-scientific and historical vocabulary in the untheorized or, at least undertheorized, way. It seems loosely now to refer to any communities in the Word living far from their native homelands. To that extent the diaspora is simply the outcome of the <b>continental</b> and international <b>migration...</b>|$|R
40|$|For Latinos {{living in}} the <b>continental</b> United States, <b>migration</b> is an {{experience}} {{that is at once}} familiar, as a historical phenomenon that shapes our lives, and ephemeral, as a series of momentous events in the lives of individuals, families, and communities that are rarely memorialized. Latino migration has contributed to a redesigned ethnic landscape in the northeastern U. S. although this migration is far less discussed as a contested site of Latino migration than that into the western United States. The two largest groups of Latinos in the Northeast, Dominican and Puerto Rican migrants and their descendants, have recorded the narratives of their migrations in cultural texts through autobiography, folklore, prose, and poetry. ^ The texts I discuss, by Pura Belpré, Pedro Henríquez Ureña, Antonia Pantoja, Junot Diaz and Angie Cruz are a part of North American literary history as well as Latino literary history. The core question guiding this research is: how do migration narratives reveal new perspectives, speak back, or contradict our existing understanding of Dominican and Puerto Rican migrations? A secondary question is in what ways do these texts contribute to a collective memory for Latino communities and thereby add to our understanding of ethnic identity? I argue these texts reveal the heterogeneity of the migrants 2 ̆ 7 identities and their migration experiences. Four of the five authors identify with an Afro-Latino diasporic identity and contribute to our memory of Afro-Latino culture. The texts express the differential experience that women and men migrants have in their lives premigration in their home countries, as well as their lives post-migration. A close reading of migration narratives yields evidence of the migrants 2 ̆ 7 agency, contradicting notions of passive Latina women and passive migrants who unquestioningly accept oppressive cultural practices. Tracing the moments of the migrants 2 ̆ 7 agency in the texts balances structural arguments that suggest that migration was almost inevitable since the migrants came from very poor countries. These migration texts reveal erasures, correct stereotypes, and amend existing knowledge with subjugated knowledges that come from the migrants 2 ̆ 7 first person perspective. The new perspectives contribute to a usable past for Latino communities. ...|$|R
40|$|High {{resolution}} {{pollen analysis}} {{was carried out}} on five peat profiles from small forest hollows at four sites in southern Sweden. The general aim {{was to investigate the}} establishment of Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies at stand-scale. The sites used for this study were all located within the area where the present distribution limits of Fagus and Picea overlap each other. The results from the different sites are presented in more detail in separate papers (Appendices I-IV). Viewed on a <b>continental</b> scale the <b>migration</b> pattern of Fagus can be correlated with climate and its change over the millennia, but at finer scales such a correlation is weaker. At stand-scale there are factors other than climate that are crucial for the establishment of Fagus (e. g., disturbance, seed dispersal, human activities). The establishment of Fagus does not show a regional coherence in southern Sweden, and this may imply that climate was not the limiting factor for its establishment. The present day distribution of Fagus in southern Sweden suggests a migration with a discontinuous front with outlying populations, and this model probably applies to its past distribution. This type of migration means that the landscape becomes infilled by dispersal from outpost stands. The timing of stand-scale establishment is then largely influenced by site-specific factors and chance. Fagus may still be migrating northwards in Sweden. It grows well in its outpost area, and it seems that present day land-use, not climate, is the limiting factor for local Fagus expansion. Fagus seeds are highly dependent on ground disturbance for successful establishment, and an undisturbed forest then consequently would be able to resist Fagus invasion for some time. A semi-open cultural landscape may be optimal for Fagus establishment, as cultural activities may create conditions particularly suitable for its regeneration. Picea invaded southern Sweden from the north during a period when the cultural landscape had already been evolving for some time. Picea is a dominant tree with an effective seed dispersal, and the relatively open and probably grazed forests in the area were not particular resistant to Picea invasion. An intensive grazing regime may not affect Picea, as grazing animals normally avoid Picea. The timing of local Picea establishment seems to be mostly controlled by its migration, i. e., it became established when its front reached the studied sites...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Processes of metamorphosis, settlement, {{and growth}} were {{examined}} in Pacific sanddab using field studies and otolith microstructure. This flatfish transforms at large sizes, has a gradual metamorphosis, and settles to a nursery on the middle <b>continental</b> shelf. Eye <b>migration</b> takes 3 months and "metamorphosis proper" which begins after completion of eye migration (CEM) takes an additional 1 - 2 months. Larvae at CEM ranged from 30 - 46 mm SL and were 125 - 224 d old. Coefficients of variation in length and age at CEM were 0. 081 and 0. 122, similar to flatfishes that transform at smaller sizes. Accessory primordia (AP) and an opaque region formed in the sagitta 14 - 49 d before CEM and 2 - 3 months {{before the start of}} the juvenile period. Depth stratified benthic surveys were conducted on the continental shelf and upper slope off central Oregon bimonthly in 1989 and in March 1990 - 1994. Peak settlement occurred in late fall and winter. Larvae initially landed on the upper slope but continued inshore to the middle shelf, a process that takes 50 - 60 d. The nursery is centered at 80 - 119 m in winter and 50 - 99 m in summer. Abundance of settling Pacific sanddab on the upper slope in March 1989 - 1994 was strongly correlated to onshore Ekman transport during the preceding 30 d (r= 0. 91, P= 0. 013, n= 6). Electron microprobe analysis revealed strong cross-otolith trends in concentrations of Sr, K, and P in Pacific sanddab and Dover sole, but trends were not related to settlement, thermal experience, or otolith and somatic growth. Margin concentrations of Cl and K differed among stations as little as 5 - 8 km apart, potentially indicating meso-scale patchiness. Patterns also imply long term cohesion of pelagic larvae, a surprising result given the 9 month to 2 year pelagic period of Dover sole. Time series of daily increment widths revealed ontogenetic, seasonal, and individual variation in otolith growth rate. Otolith growth rates were correlated with SST in 1992 and 1994, but were largely determined by timing of settlement. Otolith growth was synchronous among a small portion of each year class. Distinct growth histories acted as natural tags that allowed study of patch dynamics and settlement...|$|R
40|$|Migrations have {{recently}} returned {{as a major}} challenge to the developed nation-states of the West, particularly in Europe. The dramatic increase of migratory flows {{is caused by a}} complex conjunction of push and pull factors: the demise of the Soviet empire and of communist multinational states, and an escalation of third-world misery and tribal warfare, are among the major push factors; on the pull side, the world has become a smaller and traversable place, as electronic images and cultural icons of first-world riches reach far into the non-Western hinterlands, transnational corporations set up dependencies in Asia and Africa, and airline tickets are casier to get, thus lowering the barriers for trying one's luck in the headquarters of a globalized world. A characteristic of such push-pull migrations is the breakdown of neat categorization: economic migrations, which have become synonymous with "immigration", can no longer be easily distinguished from ethnic homeland migrations, in which whole categories of people are forced to move because of violent regime changes, war, or conquest.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Melt {{migration}} {{is an important}} process in the crust that causes significant mass transport, as well as differentiation and stabilisation of <b>continental</b> crust. Melt <b>migration</b> near the source occurs pervasively, through interconnected networks of melt-bearing structures. This style is restricted to the suprasolidus mid- to lower crust, while focused migration and ascent of magma occurs in isolated dykelike structures under subsolidus conditions, generally in the upper crust where brittle fracturing of rocks can occur. The details of how and when melt migration changes from a pervasive to focused style are poorly understood, particularly the temperature, pressure and deformation conditions which allow the transition to occur. The Nupskapa nunatak, in Dronning Maud Land of East Antarctica, exposes large cliffs that record evidence of multiple episodes of melt movement, {{in the form of}} pervasive leucogranite vein networks cross-cut by larger leucogranite dykes. Mineral equilibria modelling with THERMOCALC and comparison of results with previous work indicates that the Nupskapa nunatak records both Grenvillian and Pan-African metamorphism. Coarse-grained peak assemblages in samples from the Nupskapa area record conditions of 820 - 880 C at 9. 5 - 11. 6 kbar, while post-tectonic retrograde assemblages record late Pan-African conditions of 555 - 595 C at 3. 2 { 4. 8 kbar. These later conditions lie between the wet solidus and the brittle-viscous transition and are inferred to represent the conditions of intrusion for post-tectonic composite dykes. Small-scale leucosomes predominantly lie parallel to the gneissic host rock fabric and define a pervasive network across the Nupskapa cliff. These leucosomes exhibit diffuse feathery boundaries and are inferred to represent in situ melting and melt segregation during M 1 granulite facies peak metamorphism. Composite leucogranitic dykes cross-cut both the early leucosome phase and Pan-African shear zones in the field area. These north-trending, subvertical dykes are neariii orthogonal to the gneissic fabric. They are 0. 5 - 2 m wide and spaced ~ 10 - 20 m apart but not interconnected except where two dykes coalesce. The dykes show almost no shear displacement, indicating that they formed via tensile fracture. This indicates that their intrusion occurred during extensional or strike-slip deformation, under conditions of low differential stress, probably coupled to high melt pressure. The composite dykes resulted from the far-field transport of melt from a source 5 to 15 km below the Nupskapa outcrop. Although individually they are discrete and focused structures, they are numerous across the field area and closely spaced, so together they do not represent a wholly focused melt transfer system. The style of melt migration displayed by the composite dykes {{is an example of the}} transition from pervasive to focused migration, occurring in the mid-crust at subsolidus conditions. This transition involved a network of smaller melt-filled fractures gradually coalescing into larger ones with decreasing depth. If pervasive migration becomes focused via this gradual transition, melt accumulation and mixing need not occur solely in the source or final emplacement structure, but rather occurs throughout transport of the magma...|$|R
