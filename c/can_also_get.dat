He <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>get</b> advice from his ghost sidekick named Winston {{to learn new}} moves or to save the player's game between longer levels. Similar to the previous game, Dan's health is determined by a single health bar, which reduces when Dan is hit. It also depletes completely if he drowns or falls from a great height. If Dan completely runs out of health, the game restarts from the last known save point. Dan can refill his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which automatically refill his health if it is depleted. Whilst defeating enemies, Dan's Chalice of Souls will gradually fill up, which can then be collected and traded with Professor Kift to unlock new weapons and items.|$|E

By defeating generals and lieutenants, the player's character is awarded experience scaled by the difficulty of each officer, and the amount of them defeated.

Each star has different thresholds regarding when they will get stressed or bored. If stars get stressed, they will resort to alcoholism or over-eating. Actors play a big role in The Movies. An actor's age and physique affects the quality of movies. Scary-looking actors are suited for horror roles. Younger, more handsome looking actors are more suited for romance movie roles. 30-year-old actors are suited for action roles, and older actors are suited for comedy roles. All actors and directors will retire at age 70. However, depending on a Star's experience in the movie's genre, the movie's quality will go up if they have an adequate level of experience, or down if they do not have enough experience. All films require crew members to carry out the filming process. Early films just require a camera operator and a clapperboard operator, but more advanced films require boom mike operators, lighting controllers and other specialised crew members. Other staff include extras (which can be promoted to Star status if they are good enough), janitors, scientists, scriptwriters, builders, [...] and crew members.|$|E
