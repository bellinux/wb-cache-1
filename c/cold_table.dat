5000|$|This large {{heat flow}} into the wall has a further consequence. At {{the surface of a}} wall, floor or ceiling there is thermal {{resistance}} which takes account of the convective and radiant heat transfer at these surfaces. For a vertical internal surface this thermal resistance has a value of 0.13 m2 K/W. [...] In a dynamically insulated wall, as the conduction heat {{flow into the}} wall increases then so does the temperature drop across this internal thermal resistance increase. The wall surface temperature will become increasingly <b>colder</b> (<b>Table</b> 2). The temperature profiles through dynamic insulation taking into account the decrease in surface temperature with increasing air flow is shown in Fig 4.|$|R

50|$|Another Faroese {{specialty}} is tvøst og spik, pilot whale meat and blubber. The meat and the blubber can be preserved and prepared in different ways. Often it is cut into long thin slices, which are called likkja (grindalikkja) in singular and likkjur (grindalikkjur) in plural, {{and hung up}} to dry. These are often used for the so-called kalt borð (<b>cold</b> <b>table)</b> which is {{a table with a}} variety of cold Faroese and foreign dishes. The Faroese dishes can consist of whale meat, whale blubber, dried fish and dried lamb meat, which is called skerpikjøt. The kalda borðið (<b>cold</b> <b>table)</b> is used for festive occasions. Whale meat can also be boiled or, less traditionally, fried as steaks. There are also two ways of salting the whale meat: in dry salt or in salted water (saltlakað grind). Boiled potatoes are normally eaten together with the whale meat and the blubber, but this tradition is not very old, since potatoes were not common in the Faroe Islands before sometime in the early or mid-19th century.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first course}} in {{traditional}} Estonian cuisine {{is based on}} cold dishes—a selection of meats and sausages served with potato salad or rosolje, an Estonian signature dish, almost identical to Swedish sillsallad, based on beetroot, potatoes and herring. Small pastries called pirukad ("pirukas" [...] in the singular)—a relative of the pirozhki—filled with meat, cabbage, carrots, rice and other fillings or mixtures are also popular, and are often served with bouillion. Herring is common among other fish {{as a part of}} the Estonian <b>cold</b> <b>table.</b> Smoked or marinated eel, crayfish dishes, and imported crabs and shrimps are considered delicacies. One of Estonia's national dishes is räim (Baltic dwarf herring), along with sprats. Flounder, perch and pike-perch are also popular.|$|E
5000|$|Both {{the meat}} and blubber are stored and {{prepared}} in various ways, including Tvøst og spik. When fresh, the meat is often boiled. It can also be served as steak (grindabúffur). This dish comprises meat and blubber, which is salted and then boiled for an hour, served with potatoes. The meat can also be hung out to dry and then served in thin slivers. At parties some choose to serve [...] "kalt borð" [...] (<b>cold</b> <b>table),</b> which means a variety of cold food, which can include dried whale meat, dried blubber or blubber which is preserved in water with much salt in it, dried fish, dried sheep meat, etc. Traditionally, whale meat was preserved by hanging salted pieces (called [...] "likkjur") outdoors under a roof to be dried in the wind. This method is still used today, particularly in villages. Today, both meat and blubber can also be stored in freezers.|$|E

A few children, who had huddled together for warmth in one of the back benches and who had became glutinous and adherent through moisture, were laboriously drawn out and painfully picked apart by a watchful deacon.|$|R

5000|$|Riders {{can take}} {{advantage}} of the opportunities to enjoy the numerous beach accesses. County parks often include amenities, such as picnic <b>tables,</b> <b>cold</b> water, showers, and toilets, which are inexpensive or free to cyclists. State Highway A1A changes names many times on its journey along the coast. This is especially true as it nears Miami. Often it is located adjacent to an aquatic preserve or wildlife refuge that offers bird watching. Florida has an extensive, though sometimes confusing, network of bicycling facilities ranging from two-foot bike lanes or shoulders to separated bike paths and sidewalks. For some stretches it may be better to use the sidewalk rather than the road, but in highly trafficked beach areas the sidewalks will be for pedestrian use only. Approaches to nearly invisible short bridges are usually marked with [...] "frogs", [...] "buttons", [...] "turtles", [...] "slugs", or rumble strips. Campgrounds are almost nonexistent from Jupiter until south of Miami. After Florida City, there is a 29 mi ride with no services, potentially heavy traffic, and abundant alligators.

This project {{provides}} one {{tool for}} the design of cold formed steel elements. It is based on C channel and structural square tubes in Costa Rica’s market. The norm AISI 2007 was used because it is the most recent one when developing the research. The Screen Design Aid and the Spreadsheet were prepared in Microsoft Excel because it is a useful tool for arising complex procedures and multiple equations appear when using <b>cold</b> formed structures. <b>Tables</b> and figures are obtained for target sections, where data regarding the moment of resistance, compression, shear and tension are shown. Also, a Spreadsheet that allows to introduce new profiles for immediate analysis is added. The situations later mentioned are resolved; however, aspects like joint designs or the analysis of other kinds of failures like web crippling are not covered. In addition, it is used for the analysis of individual members and structures of the sort.

6000|$|We {{had just}} gone down below {{for a moment to}} commune in a battened- down cabin, with a large white chart lying limp and damp upon a <b>cold</b> and clammy <b>table</b> under the light of a smoky lamp. Sprawling over that seaman's silent and trusted adviser, with one elbow upon the coast of Africa and the other planted in the {{neighbourhood}} of Cape Hatteras (it was a general track-chart of the North Atlantic), my skipper lifted his rugged, hairy face, and glared at me in a half-exasperated, half-appealing way. We have seen no sun, moon, or stars for something like seven days. By the effect of the West Wind's wrath the celestial bodies had gone into hiding for a week or more, and the last three days had seen the force of a south-west gale grow from fresh, through strong, to heavy, as the entries in my log-book could testify. Then we separated, he to go on deck again, in obedience to that mysterious call that seems to sound for ever in a shipmaster's ears, I to stagger into my cabin with some vague notion of putting down the words [...] "Very heavy weather" [...] in a log-book not quite written up-to-date.

60|$|But Canada {{is not yet}} {{an ideal}} Democracy. For one thing she has {{had to work hard}} among rough-edged {{surroundings}} which carry inevitable consequences. For another, the law in Canada exists and is administered, not as a surprise, a joke, a favour, a bribe, or a Wrestling Turk exhibition, but {{as an integral part of}} the national character--no more to be forgotten or talked about than one's trousers. If you kill, you hang. If you steal, you go to jail. This has worked toward peace, self-respect, and, I think, the innate dignity of the people. On the other hand--which is where the trouble will begin--railways and steamers make it possible nowadays to bring in persons who need never lose touch of hot and <b>cold</b> water-taps, spread <b>tables,</b> and crockery till they are turned out, much surprised, into the wilderness. They clean miss the long weeks of salt-water and the slow passage across the plains which pickled and tanned the early emigrants. They arrive with soft bodies and unaired souls. I had this vividly brought home to me by a man on a train among the Selkirks. He stood on the safely railed rear-platform, looked at the gigantic pine-furred shoulder round which men at their lives' risk had led every yard of the track, and chirruped: 'I say, why can't all this be nationalised?' There was nothing under heaven except the snows and the steep to prevent him from dropping off the cars and hunting a mine for himself. Instead of which he went into the dining-car. That is one type.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MComm) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: There {{is great}} {{concern in the}} fruit {{industry}} that too much fruit and money is lost each year due to breaks occurring in the export cold chain of fresh fruit. Therefore, the CSIR (Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) and Stellenbosch University were approached to do research on this problem. This particular study focuses on the <b>cold</b> chains of <b>table</b> grapes, summer pears and plums as these fruit are especially sensitive to temperature. Observations were made on fruit farms, in pack houses, in cold stores {{as well as in}} the Port of Cape Town. From these observations it was clear that protocols are not always followed and fruit quality is sometimes neglected because of pressure to speed up the exporting process. In order to analyse the export cold chains of these fruit types, temperature trials were conducted and temperature data received from exporting companies was analysed. The data was analysed from the cold store up to the point where the vessel sailed out of the Port of Cape Town. From the analysis it became clear that too many cold chain breaks occur during fruit exports from South Africa, especially during the loading of containers at cold stores. As a final output to the study, a good cold chain practice guide for the export of table grapes was developed with the aim of assisting the fruit industry in minimizing these cold chain breaks. The guide was developed with simplicity to ensure easy understanding under all role-players in the industry. This study was a small step in the right direction, but it should be highlighted that the complexity of the problems in the fruit cold chains are substantial and further research will have to be done in order to eliminate the occurrence of these cold chain breaks...|$|R
40|$|This first {{historical}} dictionary in English of the Indochina War (1945 – 54) {{provides the}} most comprehensive account to date {{of one of the}} most important conflicts of the twentieth century. Using over 1, 600 personally researched and crafted entries, Goscha provides in-depth, expert coverage of the Indochina War in all its dimensions. A succinct historical introduction frames the dictionary. Rather than settling for a strictly politico-military account of the war, the author adopts a path-breaking dual international and interdisciplinary approach. Thus, readers will not only find information on politics and military campaigns; they will also discover the remarkable impact this war had on intellectual, social, cultural, economic and artistic domains in France, Indochina and elsewhere. Indeed, rather than limiting the dictionary to the French and their Vietnamese adversaries, Goscha explores the internationalization of this conflict from its beginning in September 1945 at Ba Dinh square in Hanoi to its end around the <b>Cold</b> War conference <b>table</b> in Geneva in July 1954. Similarly, while most authors focus on the French Fourth Republic and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the two main protagonists in this conflict, Goscha makes it clear that a myriad of other non-communist Vietnamese, Lao and Cambodian nationalists were deeply involved in this war and its outcome. In addition to its 1, 600 entries, the dictionary contains a succinct historical introduction, selected bibliography, maps, illustrations, and tables. A massive work of outstanding scholarly quality and lasting value, this is a reference tool that will be invaluable for researchers, students and anyone else interested to better understand the complexity of this tragic conflict.   Key points * First dictionary in English of the Indochina War (1945 – 54). * More than a simple military or political history of the conflict. * Adopts a path-breaking dual international and interdisciplinary approach to explore social, cultural, and economic themes underpinning the conflict. * Demonstrates the remarkable international context of what previously was regarded a simple Franco-Vietnamese war of decolonization. </p...|$|R
