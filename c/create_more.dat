The EP utilizes dance and pop music, with each song being influenced by pop rock, electronica, and trip hop music. Like Rainbow, it contains ambient-influenced sounds such as handclaps and cheering. The lyrical content deals with freedom, fun and sadness, continuing themes seen on her previous album.|$|E

5|$|After his maiden speech, Breckinridge took a {{more active}} role in the House. In debate with Ohio's Joshua Reed Giddings, he defended the Fugitive Slave Law's {{constitutionality}} and criticized Giddings for hindering the return of fugitive slaves. He opposed Tennessee Congressman Andrew Johnson's Homestead Bill, fearing it would <b>create</b> <b>more</b> territories that excluded slavery. Although generally opposed to funding local improvements, he supported the repair of two Potomac River bridges to avoid higher costs later. Other minor stands included supporting measures to benefit his district's hemp farmers, voting against giving the president ten more appointments to the U.S. Naval Academy, and opposing funds for a sculpture of George Washington because the sculptor proposed depicting Washington in a toga.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1970s, the Bureau of Land Management {{identified}} damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore natural habitat in those areas. Approximately 20,000 willow trees were planted along streams, small dams were put together to <b>create</b> <b>more</b> pools in the streams, and fencing was added to protect riparian zones from grazing. Next, the agency sought to reform land-use plans to change grazing practices, which became a complex and controversial project.|$|E
5|$|Force India driver Nico Hülkenberg {{served a}} three-place grid penalty {{following}} qualifying after being deemed at-fault for {{a collision with}} Williams driver Felipe Massa at the previous event in Singapore. Red Bull equipped both of their cars with new turning vanes for the Grand Prix {{in order to improve}} the airflow underneath the car and therefore <b>create</b> <b>more</b> downforce. The new device had previously only been used by Daniil Kvyat during the previous race in Singapore. After a poor performance in Singapore, Mercedes introduced a revised rear wing endplate, while McLaren brought a new front wing to Suzuka.|$|E

5|$|In {{return for}} a loan and a {{guarantee}} of Danish protection, Bishop Johann von Münchhausen signed a treaty on 26September 1559 giving Frederick II of Denmark the right to nominate the bishop of Ösel–Wiek, an act which amounted to the sale of these territories for 30,000 thalers. Frederick II nominated his brother, Duke Magnus of Holstein as bishop, who then took possession in April 1560. Lest Danish efforts <b>create</b> <b>more</b> insecurity for Sweden, Denmark made another attempt to mediate a peace in the region. Magnus at once pursued his own interests, purchasing the Bishopric of Courland without Frederick's consent and trying to expand into Harrien–Wierland (Harju and Virumaa). This brought him into direct conflict with Eric.|$|E
5|$|Since Carcharocles {{is derived}} from Otodus, and the two had teeth that bear a close {{similarity}} {{to those of the}} sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus), megalodon may have had a build more similar to the sand tiger shark than to other sharks. However, this is unlikely since sand tiger sharks are axial swimmers that flex their body for propulsion, meaning that they are adapted for acceleration rather than for maintaining high cruising speeds. A large sand tiger shark would require large fins to propel itself, however this in itself would <b>create</b> <b>more</b> drag and offset efficiency, so it is unlikely that they had similar body shapes given how large megalodon was.|$|E
5|$|St Helen's Church is the Anglican parish {{church of}} Ashby-de-la-Zouch, in the deanery of North West Leicestershire and the Diocese of Leicester. There was {{a church in}} the town in the 11th century, but {{the core of the}} present {{building}} mainly dates from work started in 1474, when the church was rebuilt by William Hastings {{at the same time that}} he converted his neighbouring manor house into a castle. The church was refurbished in about 1670 to <b>create</b> <b>more</b> space, but the large and increasing size of the congregation led to further work in 1829, and a major rebuild in 1878–80, including the widening of the nave by the addition of two outer aisles.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{chemical}} process, PUREX (Plutonium–URanium EXtraction) reprocesses {{spent nuclear fuel}} to extract plutonium and uranium {{which can be used}} to form a mixed oxide (MOX) fuel for reuse in nuclear reactors. Weapons-grade plutonium can be added to the fuel mix. MOX fuel is used in light water reactors and consists of 60kg of plutonium per tonne of fuel; after four years, three-quarters of the plutonium is burned (turned into other elements). Breeder reactors are specifically designed to <b>create</b> <b>more</b> fissionable material than they consume.|$|E
5|$|To {{meet the}} demands of the arrivals, ships bearing goods from around the world came to San Francisco as well. Ships' captains found that their crews deserted to go to the goldfields. The wharves and docks of San Francisco became a forest of masts, as {{hundreds}} of ships were abandoned. Enterprising San Franciscans turned the abandoned ships into warehouses, stores, taverns, hotels, and one into a jail. Many of these ships were later destroyed and used for landfill to <b>create</b> <b>more</b> buildable land in the boomtown.|$|E

In 2009, UCF directly influenced 26,000 jobs and $1.96 billion in economic activity. When UCF's economic impact is combined {{with that of the}} Central Florida Research Park, the university and park influenced 46,000 jobs and $3.84 billion in economic activity in 2009.

5|$|Winemakers {{can also}} control the {{influence}} of oak by using alternatives to the standard barrique barrels. Larger barrels have a smaller wood-to-wine ratio and therefore less pronounced oak flavors. Winemakers in Italy and Portugal sometimes use barrels made from other wood types such as chestnut and redwood. Another method that winemakers consider is tea bagging with oak chips or adding oak planks to the wines while fermenting or aging it in stainless steel tanks. While these methods are less costly than oak barrels, they <b>create</b> <b>more</b> pronounced oak flavors, which tend not to mellow or integrate {{with the rest of}} the wine's components; nor do they provide the gradual oxidation benefit of barrel aging.|$|E
5|$|Between 1900 and the 1930s, {{the number}} of runs scored by batsmen, and the {{proportion}} of lbw dismissals, continued to rise. Bowlers grew increasingly frustrated with pad-play {{and the extent to which}} batsmen refused to play shots at bowling directed outside the off stump, simply allowing it to pass by. The English fast bowler Harold Larwood responded by targeting leg stump, frequently hitting the batsman with the ball in the process. This developed into the controversial Bodyline tactics he used in Australia in 1932–33. Some batsmen began to go further and preferred to kick away balls pitched outside off stump—reaching out to kick the ball instead of allowing it to hit their pads—if they presented any threat, knowing that they could not be dismissed lbw. The authorities believed these developments represented poor entertainment value. At the height of the Bodyline controversy in 1933, Donald Bradman, the leading Australian batsman and primary target of the English bowlers, wrote to the MCC recommending an alteration of the lbw law to <b>create</b> <b>more</b> exciting games.|$|E
5|$|In March 1921, on the {{creation}} of the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy, Philomel was recommissioned as a training base. She steamed from her berth at Wellington to the dockyard at the Devonport Naval Base in Auckland. Moored alongside the training jetty, she was operated as a training facility for new recruits to the naval service, under the command of a series of officers from the Royal Navy including, for nearly six months in 1923, Commander Augustus Agar VC. Training armament was installed and in 1925, her boilers and engines were removed to <b>create</b> <b>more</b> accommodation space. Further accommodation, in the form of wooden cabins, was later constructed on her deck. In October 1941, on {{the creation}} of the Royal New Zealand Navy, Philomel was recommissioned as the training base HMNZS Philomel.|$|E

5|$|In {{light of}} the criticism, tournament organisers ERC agreed to review the penalty {{shoot-out}} system, although they confirmed that they had already considered and dismissed some other possible ways of deciding matches, including replaying the game, having a 'next try wins' rule in extra time, {{reducing the number of}} players on the pitch periodically in extra time to <b>create</b> <b>more</b> space and deciding the game on a coin toss. The format for the penalty shoot-out was changed prior to the following season's tournament, removing the requirement for all players on the field (including forwards) to participate, however for the remainder of its existence, the Heineken Cup retained the penalty shoot-out as the final system for deciding a winner if required. No other Heineken Cup match needed to use it.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{relationship}} between price level and output was explained by the quantity theory of money; David Hume had presented such a theory in his 1752 work Of Money (Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary, Part II, Essay III). Quantity theory viewed the entire economy through Say's law, which stated that whatever is supplied to the market will be sold—in short, that markets always clear. In this view, money is neutral and cannot impact the real factors in an economy like output levels. This {{was consistent with the}} classical dichotomy view that real aspects of the economy and nominal factors, such as price levels and money supply, can be considered independent from one another. For example, adding more money to an economy would be expected only to raise prices, not to <b>create</b> <b>more</b> goods.|$|E
5|$|Junya Nakano {{was born}} in Kyoto, Japan. His parents {{introduced}} him to music when he was three years old, offering him lessons in the electronic organ through the Yamaha Music Foundation; they also encouraged him to join some brass bands. After playing the 1979 arcade game Lunar Rescue, he developed an interest in video games and subsequently began to enjoy chiptune music. By frequently listening to the radio, he started composing MIDI music using the NEC PC-9801 in 1985. In 1987, he attended a vocational school to study composition and arrangement in hopes of entering the gaming industry. After graduation, he joined the Kobe branch of Konami in 1991, where he contributed music to eight arcade games with several collaborators over a three-year period. Deciding he wanted to <b>create</b> <b>more</b> original music and {{have a chance to}} receive individual recognition, Nakano left Konami after completing the score for Golfing Greats 2 in 1994.|$|E
