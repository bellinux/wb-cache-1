40|$|The Quad Model {{proposes that}} four {{cognitive}} processes are pervasive across social behavior. I describe {{the model and}} compare it to dual- and uniprocess models. Distinguishing among the four processes can provide a more nuanced and accurate depiction of social behavior than can other models. It also allows the model {{to be applied to}} a much broader range of domains. A key problem for many dual-process models is that they confound processing style with either type of content (e. g., <b>category</b> <b>vs.</b> individuating information) or type of task (implicit vs. explicit tasks). As a result, these models have trouble assessing the joint influences of multiple processes. In contrast, the Quad Model provides estimates of the independent and simultaneous contributions of 4 key processes to social behavior. Copyright © 2006 by Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc...|$|R

Combining with Carnahan's work, we extend this result to simple currents of arbitrary order. Our next result is a simple sufficient criterion for lifting indecomposable objects that only depends on conformal dimensions. Several examples of simple current extensions that are C_ 2 -cofinite and non-rational are then given and induced modules listed. Comment: 34 page...|$|R
