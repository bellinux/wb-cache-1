New types of solid end mills for low energy consumption have recently been developed. These so-called Low Power Cutting (LPC) -Tools are characterized by differential helix angles. Compared to solid end mills with variable helix angles, the new differential helix angles change their pitch continuously over the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> <b>length.</b> Due to this fact the cutting conditions {{are not in a}} constant state during the revolution of the cutting tool.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} {{a new and}} accurate strategy for estimation of cutting coefficients for ball-end milling of free form surfaces in 3 - and 5 -axis operations. Since the cutting coefficients are not constant along the tool axis in the ball part of the cutter, the tool is considered by dividing the ball region into thin disks. In order to find the contribution of each disk to resultant cutting force, an experimental setup is designed to cut the workpiece while only that disk is in engaged with the workpiece. It is shown that this method is more efficient than common methods of mechanistic identification of cutting constants that are available in literature. The derivations are improved by considering the helix angle and <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> <b>length</b> to enhance {{the accuracy of the}} estimated cutting coefficients.

In many tillage processes decreasing the draft and upward vertical forces is often desired for reduced fuel use and improved penetration, respectively. Recent studies have proved that the discrete element modelling (DEM) can effectively be used to model the soil–tool interaction. In his study, Fielke (1994) [1] examined the effect of the various tool <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> geometries, namely; <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> height, <b>length</b> of underside rub, angle of underside clearance, on draft and vertical forces. In this paper the experimental parameters of Fielke (1994) [1] were simulated using 3 D discrete element modelling techniques. In the simulations a hysteretic spring contact model integrated with a linear cohesion model that considers the plastic deformation behaviour of the soil hence provides better vertical force prediction was employed. DEM parameters were determined by comparing the experimental and simulation results of angle of repose and penetration tests. The results of the study showed that the simulation results of the soil-various tool <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> geometries agreed well with the experimental results of Fielke (1994) [1]. The modelling was then used to simulate a further range of <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> geometries to better define the effect of sweep tool <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> geometry parameters on tillage forces. The extra simulations were able to show that by using a sharper <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> with zero vertical <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> height the draft and upward vertical force were further reduced indicating there is benefit from having a really sharp <b>cutting</b> <b>edge.</b> The extra simulations also confirmed that the interpolated trends for angle of underside clearance as suggested by Fielke (1994) [1] where correct with a linear reduction in draft and upward vertical force for angle of underside clearance between the ranges of − 25 and − 5 °, and between − 5 and 0 °.

Hence, {{it has been}} hypothesised that biomechanical adaptations evolved to maximise efficiency when using such tools. Here, we test experimentally whether biometric variation influences the efficiency of simple cutting tools (n = 60 participants). Grip strength and handsize were measured in each participant. 30 participants used flint flakes, while the other 30 used small (unhafted) steel blades. Variations in basic parameters of tool form (length, width, thickness, <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> <b>length)</b> were recorded for the 30 flint flakes. It was ensured that mean handsize and strength in each participant group were not significantly different to investigate the effect of tool variation. The experimental task required cutting through a 10 mm-diameter hessian rope. Cutting efficiency was measured using both ‘Number of cutting strokes required’ and ‘Total time taken’. Results show that both efficiency measures were significantly correlated with handsize using all 60 participants. However, {{no significant differences were found}} between the flake and blade groups in terms of mean efficiency. Nor was any significant relationship found between tool form parameters and efficiency in the flint flake group. We stress that our results do not imply that tool form has no impact on tool efficiency, but rather that – all other things being equal – biometric variation has a statistically significant influence on efficiency variation when using simple cutting tools. These results demonstrate that biomechanical parameters related directly to efficiency of use, may plausibly have been subject to selection in the earliest stone tool-using hominins...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion that}} the {{evolution}} of core reduction strategies involved increasing efficiency in cutting edge production is prevalent in narratives of hominin technological evolution. Yet {{a number of studies}} comparing two different knapping technologies have found no significant differences in edge production. Using digital analysis methods we present an investigation of raw material efficiency in eight core technologies broadly representative of the long-term evolution of lithic technology. These are bipolar, multiplatform, discoidal, biface, Levallois, prismatic blade, punch blade and pressure blade production. Raw material efficiency is assessed by the ratio of <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> <b>length</b> to original core mass. We also examine which flake attributes contribute to maximising raw material efficiency, as well as compare the difference between expert and intermediate knappers in terms of cutting edge produced per gram of core. We identify a gradual increase in raw material efficiency over the broad sweep of lithic technological evolution. The results indicate that the most significant transition in efficiency likely took place with the introduction of small foliate biface, Levallois and prismatic blade knapping, all introduced in the Middle Stone Age / Middle Palaeolithic among early Homo sapiens and Neanderthals. This suggests that no difference in raw material efficiency existed between these species. With prismatic blade technology securely dated to the Middle Palaeolithic, by including the more recent punch and pressure blade technology our results dispel the {{notion that the}} transition to the Upper Palaeolithic was accompanied by an increase in efficiency. However, further increases in cutting edge efficiency are evident, with pressure blades possessing the highest efficiency in this study, indicating that late/epi-Palaeolithic and Neolithic blade technologies further increased efficiency...|$|E
40|$|In {{gas turbine}} engine, nickel base alloy, such as Alloy 718, {{accounts}} {{for almost half}} of the total material requirement. Nickel-base superalloys are used for gas turbine components mainly because of their outstanding strength and resistance to oxidation at high temperatures (> 550 °C). The massive cost involved with the machining of nickel alloys has driven continued research and development of cutting tool materials as well as of cutting techniques that ensure higher metal removal rate with minimum surface and sub-surface damage on the machined components. In machining of Alloy 718, one of major issues is the machinability variations as the result of variation in the mechanical properties and microstructures from workpiece. Sometimes it was difficult to machine different regions of the same component and when that happened, machining issues arose with chip entanglement and tool failures. The aim of the research addressed in this thesis is to explain machinability variation in Alloy 718 turbine discs with respect to material parameters such a grain size, hardness, deformation and work hardening; all of which are believed to have great influence on tool wear. The investigation was based on the large amount of production data retrieved from the production scene and the experimental data from laboratory. With this work it is expected to refine and adjust the gap between the theory and the production practice to optimize the manufacturing process in general and machining process in particular. For Alloy 718 machined with Al 2 O 3 -SiCW ceramic tools the main types of wear are mainly notch wear, flank wear and flaking wear. From retrieving used round C 670 tools in production, it was found that an optimum effective cutting angle range existed in terms of insert wear. This means that if the effective <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> <b>length</b> is controlled through programming for each feed rate lower wear rates should be obtained. A polar diagram method for describing and evaluating the machinability of Alloy 718 was developed. Five key parameters of the work material, representing the mechanical and physical properties which have strongest influence on its machinability, were employed in the construction of polar diagrams. Work materials of Alloy 718 in which the polar diagrams of machinability were similar in size and shape exhibited very similar behavior during the cutting process. A tool life model, named “ShortCut-Wear-Model”, was developed with consideration of work-hardening effect in the machining of Alloy 718 for tool life prediction.

40|$|Machinability Variations in Alloy 718 Turbine Components PAJAZIT AVDOVIC Department of Materials and Manufacturing Technology Chalmers University of Technology Abstract Alloy 718 has a {{reputation}} for being very troublesome during the cutting process. It was suspected that this material was too hard and having too fine grain size and that these characteristics caused damage to cutting tools during processing. Sometimes it was difficult to machine in different regions in the same detail. In some cases it was possible to machine some discs without any problems whilst {{at the same time a}} number of discs were very difficult to treat. For Alloy 718 machined with Al 2 O 3 SiCW ceramic tools the main types of wear are mainly notch wear, flank wear and top slice wear. From retrieving spent round C 670 tools in production, it was found that an optimum effective cutting angle range existed in terms of insert wear. This means that if the effective <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> <b>length</b> is controlled through programming for each feed rate lower wear rates should be obtained. To study the influence of different grain sizes, Alloy 718 work-piece material was heat treated. The results showed that the limiting wear type is the notch wear that occurred at the end of depth of cut, but that, no valid difference between rings with small (ASTM 8) and large grain sizes (ASTM 3. 5) in terms of flank wear or notch depth were observed. However, burr formation was observed for both materials, but of different appearance depending primarily on grain size. The large grain size gave burr formation on the surface perpendicular to the cut surface, while the small grain size gave burr formation on the cut surface. Moreover, the wear characteristics and type of burr were accordingly obtained for the material with smaller grain size (ASTM 8) as in production with the same grain size. The implication of these results is that it may be possible to select more aggressive cutting parameters as long as the flank-wear remains below 0. 3 mm and the notch wear is limited either through path programming (by varying depth of cut) or by reducing feed rate to < 0. 2 mm/rev. Finally, a polar diagram method for describing and evaluating the machinability of Alloy 718 was developed. To do this five key parameters that included adhesion, strain hardening, thermal conductivity, hardness and abrasiveness were selected to construct a polar diagram for different batches of Alloy 718 from data for similar production parts. Thereafter, related production experiments were conducted to test the relationship between the polar diagram, tool wear and the role of carbon content when machining with ceramic cutting tools. The results showed that materials like Alloy 718 with similar machinability polar diagrams in size and shape exhibited very similar behavior during cutting processes. Thus, the polar diagram method is useful and helpful to choose the suitable cutting data for a new material in machining processes.
