40|$|The {{doctoral}} thesis {{deals with the}} topic of specification and comparison of <b>cultural</b> <b>dimensions</b> of companies from different places of global community. Main focus is to answer a question, how the corporate culture and its <b>cultural</b> <b>dimensions</b> influence a shift of a company towards a knowledge-based economy. The identification of <b>cultural</b> <b>dimensions</b> was realized through the quantitative research VSM 94 in two German parent companies and their subsidiaries from the Czech Republic, India, Japan and USA. In case of one Czech subsidiary the research was extended with the qualitative research TCSD. Subsequently the identified <b>cultural</b> <b>dimensions</b> were compared with the desirable <b>cultural</b> <b>dimensions</b> of knowledge-based company. The results show that only <b>cultural</b> <b>dimensions</b> of low power distance and feminity correspond to the knowledge-based economy, long-term orientation is in the transition phase. The longest way to the knowledge-based economy was revealed by collectivism and uncertainty acceptance. Here can be found the greatest potential for corporate culture forming and human resources management. Based on the analysis of <b>cultural</b> <b>dimensions,</b> shared values, strength of corporate culture, cultural influence of parent company and impact of national culture were expressed proposals to shift the examined companies to the ideal state - knowledge-based company...|$|R

500|$|Film theorist Wheeler Winston Dixon, {{far from}} decrying the series for its {{production}} values, finds that [...] "the copious [...] stock footage and the numerous exterior sequences {{shot in the}} ruins of the bombed-out metropolis give Flash Gordon a [...] distinctly ravaged look". He writes that its international origins give the series [...] "an interesting new <b>cultural</b> <b>dimension,</b> even a perceptible air of a split cultural identity". [...] Dixon quotes German cultural historian Mark Baker, who writes of a particular scene from the episode The Brain Machine as emblematic of this cultural split. The scene uses stock footage of a June 17, 1953 demonstration by East Berlin workers against the East German government. Soviet tanks opened fire on both demonstrators and bystanders, thus confirming East Germany's status as a Soviet puppet state in the minds of West Germans. American viewers, Baker speculates, were probably unaware of the iconic power in West Germany of the images of fleeing East Berlinners, which were used to illustrate a panic on Neptune.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{primary purpose}} of this {{research}} paper is to understand the role of national <b>cultural</b> <b>dimensions</b> on e-learning practices in India. India is considered {{a major player in}} the world economy today. US multinationals are significantly increasing their presence in India and understanding local HRM practices will help global companies transition better. This conceptual paper uses the national <b>cultural</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the GLOBE project, which is identified as the most topical theoretical framework on culture. The national cultural scores are used to develop hypotheses for specific <b>cultural</b> <b>dimensions.</b> Examples from the literature are also used to strengthen the proposed hypotheses. This research proposes that national <b>cultural</b> <b>dimensions</b> of power distance, uncertainty-avoidance, in-group collectivism, and future-orientation influence e-learning practices. Future research can definitely empirically test the hypotheses proposed. This study provides e-learning strategies for multinationals while integrating two theoretical models. The suggested strategies can be implemented by multinationals in other countries with similar national <b>cultural</b> <b>dimensions</b> also. This research also proposes a theoretical e-learning model identifying the impact of national <b>cultural</b> <b>dimensions</b> on e-learning practices. This research also provides practitioners a strategic implications model that could be implemented for e-learning initiatives in multinationals.

500|$|Critical {{discussion}} of early skyscrapers began from the 1880s onwards in the architectural community and continued across a growing cultural and academic {{community in the}} inter-war period. In 1930, the terms the Chicago [...] "school" [...] and [...] "movement" [...] began {{to be used for}} the first time, popularised by the 1940s academics Sigfried Giedion and Carl Condit as a label for the early Chicago architects. They regarded skyscrapers as the early forerunners of modernism and as marking a clear break with earlier architectural forms in the U.S. This interpretation of Chicago's skyscrapers was later challenged by Robert Bruegmann and Daniel Bluestone, who argued that it underplayed the links of the movement to pre-existing Chicago culture. During the 1980s and 1990s, analysis of the early skyscrapers increasingly shifted away from the architects and architecture of the individual buildings to considerations of skyscrapers' roles in the wider urban context. Histories stressing the social, economic, and <b>cultural</b> <b>dimension</b> of skyscrapers began to be produced, with New York's skyscrapers receiving greater attention than before. The Skyscraper Museum – the first to address the theme – was founded in New York in 1997 by historian Carol Willis to preserve the history of the skyscraper.|$|E

40|$|Different {{groups have}} {{different}} culture. In Libya {{there are different}} ethnic culture {{and they are the}} main managers in the Libyan oil and gas companies. These ethnic groups include four main groups Arab, Berbers (Amazigh), Toubou and Tuaregs and each group has their own language, heritage, customs, values and beliefs even they have their own flag. The role of information technology capability in mediating the influence between <b>cultural</b> <b>dimensions</b> and organizational intelligence which ultimately contributes towards the performance of the companies are competitive advantage. The Libyan oil and gas companies are in dispersed locations, which necessitate an efficient and effective management system to improve their competitiveness, they need to pool resources in the organization to create organizational intelligence as to be competitive. Organizational intelligence is organizational practices which are influenced by <b>cultural</b> <b>dimensions</b> and IT capability. The objective of the study is to investigate how <b>cultural</b> <b>dimensions</b> influences organizational intelligence through IT capability in the Libyan oil and gas companies. These culture dimensions include resonant leadership, ethnic culture and organization culture. A quantitative research method based on survey questionnaire was used to collect numerical data that were statistically analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics based on Statistical Package of Social Science (SPSS) software and AMOS module. A total of 163 managers in the Libyan oil and gas companies were randomly selected as the respondents. The result of the analysis showed a significant relationship between <b>cultural</b> <b>dimensions</b> and organizational intelligence with a high correlation. <b>Cultural</b> sub <b>dimensions</b> of organizational culture also reflected a strong positive correlation. In other hand, the sub dimension ethnic culture and organizational intelligence were moderately correlated, the sub dimensions of resonant leadership the correlation was significant positive and strongly correlated. Finally, IT capability and organizational intelligence were moderately correlated. The result of the analysis for the regression of the mediation effect was conducted using two methods; conventional (Baron and Kenny) and contemporary (The Sobel Test and SEM), for an accurate result on how IT capability mediates between <b>cultural</b> <b>dimensions</b> and organizational intelligence. Result showed that resonant leadership was the significant predictors of organizational intelligence among the three <b>cultural</b> <b>dimensions.</b> IT capability, however partially mediates the influence between <b>cultural</b> <b>dimensions</b> and organizational intelligence. <b>Cultural</b> <b>dimensions</b> and IT capability are proven to be the Predictors of organizational intelligence. <b>Cultural</b> <b>dimensions</b> as whole influence IT capability. The sub <b>dimension</b> of <b>cultural</b> <b>dimensions</b> is resonant leadership which directly influence organizational intelligence, other <b>cultural</b> <b>dimensions</b> which are ethnic culture and organization culture influence organizational intelligence through IT capability. This study contributes towards new knowledge through the development of a predictor’s model of organizational intelligence in the context of Libyan oil and gas companies. The predictor’s model contributes towards practice through better decision making where the oil and gas companies management can decide on their investment for their companies in the future in order to increase their organizational intelligence. Moreover, this study, gives insights on how <b>cultural</b> <b>dimensions</b> influence organizational intelligence (OI) ...|$|R

Qutb, an Egyptian who was the leading intellectual of the Muslim Brotherhood, studied in Greeley, Colorado from 1948 to 1950, and wrote a book, The America I Have Seen (1951) based on his impressions. In it he decried everything in America from individual freedom and taste in music to Church socials and haircuts. Wrote Qutb, [...] "They danced to the tunes of the gramophone, and the dance floor was replete with tapping feet, enticing legs, arms wrapped around waists, lips pressed to lips, and chests pressed to chests. The atmosphere was full of desire..." [...] He offered a distorted chronology of American history and was disturbed by its sexually liberated women: [...] "The American girl is well acquainted with her body's seductive capacity. She knows it lies in the face, and in expressive eyes, and thirsty lips. She knows seductiveness lies in the round breasts, the full buttocks, and in the shapely thighs, sleek legs – and she shows all this and does not hide it". He was particularly disturbed by jazz, which he called the American's preferred music, and which [...] "was created by Negroes to satisfy their love of noise and to whet their sexual desires ..." [...] Qutb's writings influenced generations of militants and radicals in the Middle East who viewed America as a cultural temptress bent on overturning traditional customs and morals, especially {{with respect to the}} relations between the sexes.|$|E

Cross-cultural communication ability is becoming a key management skill in multinational firms and is equally important for other employees who are exposed to other cultures in the workplace. This work mainly focuses on cultural specifics of management in multinational firms. The goal of this thesis is to discover how different national cultures influence management of people, particularly work relationships, management tools and organization structures. The author discovers this through <b>cultural</b> <b>dimensions</b> that she updates for the Czech Republic and Slovakia for her work using methodology of Fons Trompenaars.
