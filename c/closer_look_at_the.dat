5|$|The MSE {{method is}} also {{sensitive}} to secondary clustering. One {{example of this}} phenomenon is when a set of observations is thought {{to come from a}} single normal distribution, but in fact comes from a mixture normals with different means. A second example is when the data is thought to come from an exponential distribution, but actually comes from a gamma distribution. In the latter case, smaller spacings may occur in the lower tail. A high value of M(θ) would indicate this secondary clustering effect, and suggesting a <b>closer</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> data is required.|$|E
5|$|Cassini {{observations}} {{provided a}} much <b>closer</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crater distribution and size, showing {{that many of}} Enceladus' craters are heavily degraded through viscous relaxation and fracturing. Viscous relaxation allows gravity, over geologic time scales, to deform craters and other topographic features formed in water ice, {{reducing the amount of}} topography over time. The rate at which this occurs is dependent on the temperature of the ice: warmer ice is easier to deform than colder, stiffer ice. Viscously relaxed craters tend to have domed floors, or are recognized as craters only by a raised, circular rim. Dunyazad crater {{is a prime example of}} a viscously relaxed crater on Enceladus, with a prominent domed floor.|$|E

25|$|In fact, Drake {{had been}} {{preparing}} for action since the previous visit by Ranger, taking on volunteers from the Carrickfergus area to boost the crew from 100 to about 160, many of them landsmen who were to be used only for close-quarters combat, {{although there was a}} shortage of ammunition. Absent from the ship's company at this crucial time were the gunner, master's mate, boatswain, and lieutenant. The aging captain, George Burdon, was later reported to have been in poor health himself. Drake got under way about 8am, but with wind and tide against it, made little progress. After an hour or so a boat was therefore sent to get a <b>closer</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> intruder. Jones opted to try a slight variant of the plan which had failed to capture the customs vessel a few days earlier; hiding most of the crew and the big guns. This time it worked; the crew of the reconnaissance boat was captured, and this success raised the morale of the Americans. One of the prisoners revealed the large number of volunteers who had gone aboard Drake.|$|E

25|$|A {{seemingly}} paradoxical role of AMPK {{occurs when}} we take a <b>closer</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> energy-sensing enzyme in relation to exercise and long-term training. Similar to short-term acute training scale, long-term endurance training studies also reveal increases in oxidative metabolic enzymes, GLUT-4, mitochondrial size and quantity, and an increased dependency on the oxidation of fatty acids; however, Winder et al. reported in 2002 that despite observing these increased oxidative biochemical adaptations to long-term endurance training (similar to those mentioned above), the AMPK response (activation of AMPK {{with the onset of}} exercise) to acute bouts of exercise decreased in red quadriceps (RQ) with training (3 – see Fig.1). Conversely, the study did not observe the same results in white quadriceps (WQ) and soleus (SOL) muscles that they did in RQ. The trained rats used for that endurance study ran on treadmills 5 days/wk in two 1-h sessions, morning and afternoon. The rats were also running up to 31m/min (grade 15%). Finally, following training, the rats were sacrificed either at rest or following 10 min. of exercise.|$|E

[...] It was demonstrated in the Matawan Creek attacks, for example, that the full moon of the lunar cycle, which would have coincided with the attacks, would have raised the salinity in the water by more than double just a few hours before high tide. [...] This would have shown support for the theory that a great white could have been responsible. [...] Other evidence such as Joseph Dunn's injury suggested that the type of bite was more likely made by a bull shark as opposed to a great white, leading some to believe more than one shark was likely involved in the five incidents.|$|E
500|$|While one set {{of critics}} and bloggers used the UCLA study to dismiss the {{argument}} raised in Carr's essay, another set took a <b>closer</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> conclusions that could {{be drawn from the}} study concerning the effects of Internet usage. Among the reflections concerning the possible interpretations of the UCLA study were whether greater breadth of brain activity while using the Internet in comparison with reading a book improved or impaired the quality of a reading session; and whether the decision-making and complex reasoning skills that are apparently involved in Internet search, according to the study, suggest a high quality of thought or simply the use of puzzle solving skills. Thomas Claburn, in InformationWeek, observed that the study's findings regarding the cognitive impact of regular Internet usage were inconclusive and stated that [...] "it will take time before it's clear whether we should mourn the old ways, celebrate the new, or learn to stop worrying and love the Net".|$|E

500|$|I'm Going to Tell You a Secret {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. O'Brien noted how the film revealed a [...] "strange isolation {{at the cost}} of stardom" [...] from Madonna. She complimented the scenes featuring her father, and the scenes where Madonna was not self-conscious, like when she interacts with her children, talks about her [...] "fat Italian thighs" [...] and also the performance in rain at Dublin. O'Brien criticized other portions of the film, which she said was [...] "affected" [...] by conscious behavior in front of the camera, like backstage parties, poem and piano recitals. Author J. Randy Taraborrelli wrote in his book [...] that the film allowed a much <b>closer</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> singer's family. He was particularly impressed by the scenes featuring Lourdes, believing that she [...] "revealed herself to be sophisticated beyond her years". Kathryn Flett from The Observer newspaper described it as [...] "Fascinating, [...] tiny flashes of insight into her relationship with , which occasionally involve her being just as girlie and ever so slightly insecure as the rest of us." [...] Rupert Smith from The Guardian reported that the director [...] "squeezed every last drop of spectacle from a highly stage-managed performance", but commented that [...] "she gave away far more in 1991's In Bed with Madonna; this time she gave only the illusion of candour". However, he complimented saying [...] "Even the easy-to-mock pre-show prayers brought a tear to the eye. We don't need to be told that 'there's more to life than fame and fortune– something deeper, more profound', or that 'the material world' is a bad thing.

The rest of the video then is presented {{through the use of a}} handheld video camera. Grande is in a Fiat car as the passenger, with her boyfriend (played by Matt Bennett), who is recording. They are stuck in traffic as they try to leave the city, implied to be Los Angeles, California. While everyone around them is panicking, Grande seems to be calm as she wants to get a <b>closer</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> comet. Impatient, she leaves the car while Bennett tries to stop her, and then follows. They make their way through the crowds, but are stopped by the police who are barricading the street. Meanwhile, the comet erupts in the sky and begins to crash to the ground as the song starts. Grande manages to get through but Bennett is unable to, so he goes through an open ambulance and manages to catch up with her in an alleyway with stairs leading up into an apartment complex. Ariana notices the comet in the sky. The two enter a home of a frightened family and try to leave through the other door, only for the comet to crash into the building, nearly killing both of them. Frightened, the two continue on and enter a room filled with television screens of the comet and an old man sitting at a desk. As the former two of them try to leave, the latter tries to stop them, but they knock him to the ground, and all the screens change to the same countdown timer. [...] Grande and Bennett eventually make their way up the rooftop after subduing the old man again, who had caught up with them. The camera is then set down, and shows the two of them embracing each other one last time until the comet crashes down, destroys everything and leads the Earth to an end.|$|E

So removing the line segment (1/3,2/3) from the original interval [...] leaves behind the points 1/3 [...] and 2/3. Subsequent steps do not remove these (or other) endpoints, since the intervals removed are always internal to the intervals remaining. [...] So the Cantor set is not empty, and in fact contains an uncountably infinite number of points (as follows from the above description in terms of paths in an infinite binary tree).|$|E
