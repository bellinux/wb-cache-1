40|$|In states {{bordering}} the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, vast areas of <b>coastal</b> <b>land</b> {{have been destroyed}} since the mid 1800 s {{as a result of}} natural processes and human activities. The physical factors that have the greatest infl uence on <b>coastal</b> <b>land</b> loss are reductions in sediment supply, relative sea level rise, and frequent storms, whereas the most important human activities are sediment excavation, river modifi cation, and coastal construction. As a result of these agents and activities, <b>coastal</b> <b>land</b> loss is manifested most commonly as beach/bluff erosion and coastal submergence. Wetlands are a unique class of <b>coastal</b> <b>lands</b> so they are considered independent of upland coastal areas. Wetlands are subjected to the same physical process and activities as other <b>coastal</b> <b>lands,</b> but they are also susceptible to deterioration as a result of biogeochemical processes. Failed reclamation projects and induced subsidence also contribute locally to wetland losses in the southeastern US...|$|R

Land Use Policy, 19, (2), 177 - 185 The Countryside and Rights of Way Act (2000) gives powers to the Secretary of State for England and the National Assembly for Wales to include <b>coastal</b> <b>lands</b> as ?open country? and as such provides a right of access. The Countryside Council for Wales considers that {{access to the}} <b>coastal</b> <b>lands</b> of Wales should be developed via a voluntary approach.

25|$|Because of {{differences}} in the specific heat capacity of land and water, continents heat up faster than seas. Consequently, the air above <b>coastal</b> <b>lands</b> heats up faster than the air above seas. This creates areas of low air pressure above <b>coastal</b> <b>lands</b> compared with pressure over the seas, causing winds to flow from the seas onto the neighboring lands. This is known as sea breeze.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{ascertain}} the possible effects of <b>coastal</b> <b>land</b> reclamation and development on existing seagrass spatial distribution of Halophila ovalis and Halophila beccarii surrounding a man-made islet within Penang waters. The hypothesis was that <b>coastal</b> <b>land</b> reclamation and development has a negative effect on existing seagrass distribution and density. The ArcGIS 10 spatial analysis tools, Standard Deviational Ellipse (SDE) and Standard Distance (SD), were applied to determine phase shifts as an indicator of possible effect of <b>coastal</b> <b>land</b> reclamation on the seagrass distribution. Seagrass shoot densities data used were from year 2003, 2006 and 2009; where 2003 and 2006 represented pre-coastal development period, while 2009 represented on-going coastal development period. Results showed SDE of seagrass experienced shifts from west to north-west direction from 2003 to 2009, which is away from the <b>coastal</b> <b>land</b> reclamation site. In addition, SD result showed seagrass distribution in the islet had shifted from west to east, and was more compacted and concentrated in 2009. The shifts of seagrass mean centre from west to the east also coincided with SD analysis where the largest distance value of 28. 21 m calculated from centroid occurred in 2009. The shifts in seagrass SDE, SD and mean centres strengthened the hypothesis that the <b>coastal</b> <b>land</b> reclamation and development had a negative effect on seagrass spatial distribution and density in Penang waters. The directional trend, compactness and mean centre of seagrass observed to be directed away and concentrated further from the coastal development site by 2009...|$|R
