40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} a {{recently}} proposed {{mode of operation}} for block ciphers which we refer to as statistical cipher feedback (SCFB) mode. SCFB mode configures the block cipher as a keystream generator {{for use in a}} stream cipher such that it has the property of statistical self-synchronization, thereby allowing the stream cipher to recover from slips in the communications channel. Statistical self-synchronization involves feeding back ciphertext to the input of the keystream generator similar to the <b>conventional</b> <b>cipher</b> feedback (CFB) mode of block ciphers, except that the feedback only occurs when a special pattern is recognized in the ciphertext. In the paper, we examine the efficiency, resynchronization, and error propagation characteristics of SCFB and compare these to the conventional modes of CFB, output feedback (OFB), and counter mode. In particular, we study these characteristics of SCFB {{as a function of the}} synchronization pattern size.

This kind of cipher can be decrypted with probability one in principle by the Brute force attack in which an eavesdropper tries all the possible keys based on the correct ciphertext and some known plaintext. A cipher with quantum effects in physical layer may protect the system from the Brute force attack by means of the quantum no cloning theorem and randomizations based on quantum noise effect. The randomizations for the ciphertext which is the output from the mathematical encryption box is crucial to realize a quantum enigma cipher. Especially, by randomizations, it is necessary to make a substantial difference in accuracy of ciphertext in eavesdropper's observation and legitimate user's observation.

The <b>conventional</b> <b>cipher</b> is designed by a mathematical algorithm and its security is evaluated by the complexity of the algorithm for cryptanalysis and ability of computers. This kind of cipher cannot exceed the Shannon limit of cryptography,and it can be decrypted with probability one in principle by trying all the possible keys against the data length equal to the secret key length. A cipher with quantum effect in physical layer may exceed the Shannon limit of cryptography. The quantum stream cipher by α/η or Yuen- 2000 protocol (Y- 00) which operates at Gbit/sec is a typical example of such a cipher. That is, ciphertext of mathematical cipher with a secret key is masked by quantum noise of laser light when an eavesdropper observes optical signals as a ciphertext of the mathematical cipher, while the legitimate receiver does not suffer the quantum noise effect. As a result, the inherent difference of accuracy of ciphertext between eavesdropper and legitimate receiver arises. This is a necessary condition to exceed the Shannon limit of cryptography. In this note, we present a new method to generate an inherent difference of accuracy of the ciphertext, taking into account a fundamental properties of quantum detection schemes.

The need for a new <b>conventional</b> <b>cipher</b> which resists all known attacks was the main inspiration of this work. The design of a secret-key block cipher algorithm called DCU-Cipher, that resists all known cryptanalysis methods is proposed in this dissertation. The proposed method is workable for either 64 -bit plaintext/ 64 -bit ciphertext blocks, or 128 -bit plaintext/ 128 -bit ciphertext blocks. The secret key in both styles is 128 -bit long. This method has only four rounds and the main transformation function in this cipher algorithm is based on four mixed operations. The proposed method is suitable for both hardware and software implementation. It is also suitable for cryptographic hash function implementations. Two techniques for file and/or data communication encryption are also proposed here. These modes are modified versions of the Cipher-Block Chaining mode, by which the threat of the known-plaintext differential cyptanalytical attack is averted.

We distinguish between the raw security of K when the attacker just gets at K before it is used in a cryptographic context and its composition security when the attacker may gain further information during its actual use to help getting at K.

40|$|Abstract. Though <b>conventional</b> block <b>cipher</b> {{is widely}} used in Peer-to-Peer storage systems, it is {{insufficient}} to ensure the confidentiality of long-term archive data because of the inherent Peer-to-Peer storage vulnerability that data is stored on other untrusted peers. There are two potential security weak spots: (1) sensitive data may be exposed from the encrypted data stored on an adversary peer when the weakness of block cipher is discovered or there is a leakage of secret key; (2) even when a user realizes the security threats, he/she cannot destroy the encrypted data stored on an adversary peer to minimizing the loss. This paper proposes a novel secure erasure code (SEC) scheme to solve the above security problems. The SEC scheme encodes the sensitive data into several fragments, and then stores the fragments onto different peers. In theory, SEC ensures unconditional confidentiality at the fragment level, which means that an adversary cannot obtain any portion of sensitive data from local stored encrypted fragment even if he/she has the secret key and infinite computation power. By leveraging the large scale property of Peer-to-Peer systems, SEC further makes it infeasible for the adversary to collect enough fragments for decrypting. SEC can be used alone or together with block cipher to solve these potential security problems. The performance {{results show that the}} SEC scheme is practical for the real-world applications. ...|$|R
