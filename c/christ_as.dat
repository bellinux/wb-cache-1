5|$|In 1938 Joaquín {{returned}} to Monterrey to preach {{to his former}} associates. There he learned {{that he had been}} baptized using the Trinitarian formula and not in the name of Jesus <b>Christ</b> <b>as</b> he preached. His re-baptism in the name of Jesus Christ by his collaborator Lino Figueroa marked Joaquín's separation {{from the rest of the}} Pentecostal community.|$|E
5|$|The {{influential}} eighteenth-century Reformed theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher saw {{problems with}} all of the Reformation positions on Christ's presence in the Eucharist, and hoped that a new articulation of the doctrine would be made. He emphasized the function of the Supper of confirming Christians' union with <b>Christ</b> <b>as</b> well as the union they have with one another.|$|E

5000|$|Although the Orfeo {{legend has}} its origin in pagan antiquity, the Medieval romance of Sir Orfeo {{has often been}} intrepreted as drawing {{parallels}} between the Greek hero and Jesus freeing souls from Hell, with the explication of Orpheus' descent and return from the Underworld as an allegory for <b>Christ's</b> <b>as</b> early as the Ovide Moralisé (1340).|$|R
5|$|Both of Cimabue's {{surviving}} crucifixes {{were commissioned}} by the Franciscan order. Founded by Saint Francis of Assisi, their reformist, religious and social views {{had a profound effect}} on the visual arts in the century after his death. The son of a wealthy cloth merchant, Francis abandoned his inheritance to take up preaching in his mid-twenties. He venerated poverty and developed a deep appreciation for the beauty of nature. Byzantine depictions tended to show <b>Christ</b> <b>as</b> invincible, even in death. Imagery based on Franciscan ideals in the thirteenth century generally reinforce his veneration of simplicity and naturalism, infusing the paintings with the new values of humanism.|$|E
5|$|Eliot {{started writing}} East Coker in 1939, and {{modelled}} the poem after Burnt Norton {{as a way}} to focus his thoughts. The poem served as a sort of opposite to the popular idea that The Waste Land served as an expression of disillusionment after World War I, though Eliot never accepted this interpretation. The poem focuses on life, death, and continuity between the two. Humans are seen as disorderly and science is viewed as unable to save mankind from its flaws. Instead, science and reason lead mankind to warfare, and humanity needs to become humble in order to escape the cycle of destruction. To be saved, people must recognize <b>Christ</b> <b>as</b> their savior as well as their need for redemption.|$|E
5|$|In such studies, and {{in general}} Latter Day Saint parlance, the -suffixed terms Josephite and Brighamite {{have been used for}} the Missouri-based Community of Christ and the Utah-based LDS Church respectively; these terms have {{sometimes}} been used to distinguish groups of denominations as well. Those denominations within each group share a common ancestry and basic beliefs that are different from groups sharing other provenances. The present article, in a similar fashion, distinguishes among groups of denominations by use of commonly understood names such as Mormon fundamentalist or else by short descriptions that often reference a founder of the first church within a factional group–for example, Joseph Smith III in reference to Community of <b>Christ</b> <b>as</b> well as various churches and factions that trace their origin to it.|$|E

5|$|In the {{forensics}} laboratory, Arun {{discovers that}} the body is not Susanna's; however, he declares Susanna dead in his reports. He looks for her; when he finds Susanna, she tells him she is finally getting married {{the next day to}} someone who accepts her, knowing all her sins. In an epiphany she imagines Jesus <b>Christ</b> <b>as</b> her seventh husband, full of love and never hurtful; she becomes a nun and finding the love she sought all her life. Arun and Nandini return home after he tells her that Susanna is dead.|$|E
5|$|Kipandjikusmin {{later wrote}} to Ekspres {{magazine}} that his goal {{in writing the}} short story was to expose the corruption in Sukarno's government, focusing on the religious leaders who had agreed with Nasakom when it was politically expedient to do so, yet turned against the PKI when the party was hunted and its members killed. He also admitted the influences proposed by Jassin, writing that he had often thought of the Catholic heaven as being similar to the Javanese Kahyangan, with God being similar to Batara Guru. His depictions of Muhammad and Gabriel transforming into eagles were influenced by images of <b>Christ</b> <b>as</b> the Lamb of God. It was originally {{meant to be a}} serial, and Jassin had already received the second instalment by the time the controversy began.|$|E
5|$|The Annunciation was {{a popular}} theme in European art, {{although}} a difficult scene to paint, because it depicts Mary's union with <b>Christ</b> <b>as</b> she becomes the tabernacle for the Word made flesh. Mary as Theotokos, the God-bearer, was affirmed in 431 at the Council of Ephesus; two decades later the Council of Chalcedon affirmed the doctrine of Incarnation– that Christ was of two natures (God and Man)– and her perpetual virginity was affirmed at the Lateran Council of 631. In Byzantine art, Annunciation scenes depict the Virgin enthroned and dressed in royal regalia. In later centuries she was shown in enclosed spaces: the temple, the church, the garden.|$|E

5|$|The Order of the	White Shrine of Jerusalem Like {{the members}} of the Masonic Lodge and other {{appendant}} bodies, members of the White Shrine must profess a belief in a Supreme Being. However, the White Shrine goes one step further, requiring members to profess a belief in Jesus <b>Christ</b> <b>as</b> the Savior and Redeemer of the World. Membership is open to female relatives of Master Masons or members either active for three years or majority of the International Order of Rainbow for Girls or Job's Daughters International who have attained of eighteen (18) years of age.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the poems, the end {{becomes the}} {{beginning}} and things constantly repeat. This use of circular time {{is similar to the}} way Dante uses time in his Divine Comedy – Little Gidding ends with a rose garden image that {{is the same as the}} garden beginning Burnt Norton. The repetition of time affects memory and how one can travel through their own past to find permanency and the divine. Memory within the poem is similar to how St. Augustine discussed it, in that memory allows one to understand words and life. The only way to discover eternity is through memory, understanding the past, and transcending beyond time. Likewise, in the Augustinian view that Eliot shares, timeless words are connected to <b>Christ</b> <b>as</b> the Logos and how Christ calls upon mankind to join him in salvation.|$|E
5|$|The Pharisee Nicodemus {{supports}} <b>Christ</b> <b>as</b> he is lowered, and can {{be identified}} by his similarity to Simon the Pharisee in another canvas attributed to Bouts, Christ in the House of Simon. The Virgin wears a white headdress and a dark blue dress with a yellowish mantle, and holds Christ's arm just above his wrist as if afraid {{to let go of}} her dead son. She is supported by John the Evangelist, who wears a red robe. Dressed in green robes, Mary Salome stands to the Virgin's left, wiping tears from her face with the fold of her white headdress. Mary of Clopas is behind them, holding a red cloth over her mouth, while the Magdalen is in the foreground at Christ's feet, dressed in a heavily folded cloak. The man in the brown–green tabard at the feet of Christ is probably Joseph of Arimathea, who, according to Gospel, brought Christ's body to Golgotha from Pontius Pilate.|$|E

She then arrives at one building where Pérez is at the balcony putting his shirt on while Furtado interpreters the lyrics referring to him. He then starts joining her as other residents start starring at them. Scenes are intercut {{with both of them}} at a pastry shop, seductively eating ice cream. Then, Pérez is shown at an underground graffiti place rapping his verse on the song. Scenes are intercut with both of them at a club playing pool. The video intercuts with scenes of Furtado and Pérez dancing while performing the song, crowded with other people around them. The video ends with both of them walking towards the bridge in an early morning.|$|E

25|$|Following in the Pauline tradition, in the 5th century Augustine of Hippo viewed <b>Christ</b> <b>as</b> the {{mediator}} of the New Covenant between God and man {{and as the}} conqueror over sin. He viewed <b>Christ</b> <b>as</b> the cause and reason for the reconciliation of man with God {{after the fall of}} Adam, and he saw in Christ the path to Christian salvation. Augustine believed that salvation is available to those who are worthy of it, through faith in Christ.|$|E
