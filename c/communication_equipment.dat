5|$|A {{widely used}} alloy which {{contains}} zinc is brass, in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from 3% to 45% zinc, {{depending upon the}} type of brass. Brass is generally more ductile and stronger than copper and has superior corrosion resistance. These properties make it useful in <b>communication</b> <b>equipment,</b> hardware, musical instruments, and water valves. Other widely used alloys that contain zinc include nickel silver, typewriter metal, soft and aluminium solder, and commercial bronze. Alloys of primarily zinc with small amounts of copper, aluminium, and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. Roughly one quarter of all zinc output, in the United States (2009), is consumed {{in the form of}} zinc compounds, a variety of which are used industrially.|$|E
5|$|Ramírez Treviño {{was arrested}} during a joint {{operation}} between the Mexican Army and Navy in Reynosa, Tamaulipas {{on the morning}} of 17 August 2013. In the operative the federal agents confiscated three assault rifles, nine <b>communication</b> <b>equipment,</b> and more than US$38,000 and $25,000 pesos (about US$2,000). They also arrested the drug lord with two of his bodyguards. The Mexican federal government first confirmed the arrest of the drug lord via Twitter and then issued a short statement of the operative, but did not offer major details until the following day during a formal press conference. That same day, he was flown from the General Lucio Blanco International Airport in Reynosa to Mexico City under tight security and kept at the SEIDO installations, Mexico's organized crime investigatory agency. The government responded to the arrest by strengthening security and increasing the presence of federal troops in northeastern Mexico in order to neutralize any incursion from rival criminal organizations like Los Zetas in the region. On 21 August 2013, he was transferred to the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1 maximum security prison in Almoloya de Juárez, State of Mexico by the Mexican Army.|$|E
5|$|With the ROK army in retreat, the 766th Regiment, 549th Unit, and KPA's 5th Divisions all {{advanced}} steadily {{south along}} the eastern roads without encountering much resistance. Across the entire front the North Korean Army had successfully routed the South Koreans and was pushing them south. The 766th Regiment acted as an advance force, attempting to infiltrate further inland as it moved through the mountainous eastern region of the country. The rugged terrain of the eastern regions of Korea, poor <b>communication</b> <b>equipment,</b> and unreliable resupply lines thwarted the South Korean resistance. The North Koreans used this to their advantage in advancing but they began to experience the same problems themselves. The 5th Division and the two other units began advancing south slowly and cautiously, sending strong reconnaissance parties into the mountains to ensure {{they would not be}} threatened from the rear. However, this more cautious advance began to give the South Koreans valuable time to build up further south. By June 28, the 766th had infiltrated into Taebaek-san from Uljin and was moving toward Ilwolsan, Yongyang and Cheongsong in order to block communications between Daegu and Busan, where United States Army forces were landing in an attempt to support the collapsing ROK Army.|$|E
