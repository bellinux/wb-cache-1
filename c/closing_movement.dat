5|$|The Fugue in G minor, BWV 131a is a {{transcription}} for {{organ of}} the fugue from the <b>closing</b> <b>movement</b> of the cantata. Although the work has an BWV number, it is not certain that the arranger was Bach.|$|E
5|$|BWV648 is a chorale prelude for organ {{transcribed}} {{from the}} cantata's fifth movement. It {{was first published}} around 1748 as fourth of the Schübler Chorales. The music of the cantata's <b>closing</b> <b>movement</b> {{is included in the}} Dietel collection, a 1730s manuscript containing 149 of Bach's four-part chorales. C.P.E. Bach published the same music of BWV10 as No.357 in Part IV of his 1780s collected edition of four-part chorales by his father.|$|E

500|$|In {{the format}} of Bach's chorale cantata cycle, {{the words of the}} hymn are {{retained}} unchanged only in the outer movements, while an unknown contemporary librettist paraphrased the inner stanzas for recitatives and arias. Bach structured the cantata in six movements, setting the chorale tune in a chorale fantasia in the opening movement, and in a four-part setting in the <b>closing</b> <b>movement.</b> The two choral movements frame alternating recitatives and arias of three vocal soloists. Bach also used a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of a choir of trombones, two oboes, [...] strings and continuo. He set the first movement in [...] "archaic" [...] motet style, but the arias in [...] "modern" [...] concertante style, only occasionally reminiscent of the chorale tune.|$|E
500|$|Sorabji's symphonic first {{movements}} have been labelled as [...] "symphonic tapestries" [...] and [...] "a kind of pure music drama". Their organisation {{is related to}} that of his Second and Third Piano Sonatas and {{to that of the}} <b>closing</b> <b>movement</b> of the First Organ Symphony. They have been described as being based superficially on either the fugue or the sonata-allegro form, but they differ from the normal application of those forms in that the exposition and development of themes are guided not by conventional tonal principles but by the way the themes, {{in the words of the}} musicologist Simon John Abrahams, [...] "battle with each other for domination of the texture". These movements can last over 90 minutes, and their thematic character varies considerably: while the opening movement of his Fourth Piano Sonata (1928–29) introduces seven themes, that of his Second Piano Symphony (1954) has sixty-four.|$|E
500|$|The {{gestation}} of Shostakovich's Thirteenth Symphony, Babi Yar, {{was only}} slightly less straightforward. He set the poem Babi Yar by Yevgeny Yevtushenko almost immediately upon reading it, initially considering it a single-movement composition. Discovering three other Yevtushenko poems in the poet's collection Vzmakh ruki (A Wave of the Hand) prompted him to proceed to a full-length choral symphony, with [...] "A Career" [...] as the <b>closing</b> <b>movement.</b> Musicologist Francis Maes comments that Shostakovich did so by complementing Babi Yar's theme of Jewish suffering with Yevtushenko's verses about other Soviet abuses: [...] "'At the Store' {{is a tribute to}} the women who have to stand in line for hours to buy the most basic foods,... 'Fears' evokes the terror under Stalin. 'A Career' is an attack on bureaucrats and a tribute to genuine creativity". Music historian Boris Schwarz adds that the poems, in the order Shostakovich places them, form a strongly dramatic opening movement, a scherzo, two slow movements and a finale.|$|E

40|$|A double {{diastolic murmur}} was {{heard in a}} patient with mitral stenosis, atrial fibrillation, and {{complete}} heart block. Echo-phonocardiographic examination showed two separate opening and <b>closing</b> <b>movements</b> of the mitral valve in the same long diastole. A clear time relation was observed between the valve <b>closing</b> <b>movements</b> and the separate diastolic murmurs, giving support to {{the theory that the}} backward motion of the mitral valve against the forward blood flow through the valve is responsible for the production of these murmurs...|$|R

60|$|Within, the Hit or Miss looked cosey {{enough to}} persons {{entering}} {{out of the}} cold and dark. There was heat, light, and a bar-parlor with a wide old-fashioned chimney-place, provided with seats within the ingle. On these little benches did Tommy and his friends make haste to place themselves, comfortably disposed, and thawing rapidly, in a room within a room, as it were; for the big chimney-place was like a little chamber by itself. Not on an ordinary night could such a party have gained admittance to the bar-parlor, where Maitland himself was wont to appear, now and then, when he visited the tavern, and to produce by his mere presence, and without in the least intending it, an Early <b>Closing</b> <b>Movement.</b>|$|E
40|$|There {{are very}} little controversies on {{occlusion}} in healthy individuals, where centric relation {{is regarded as}} the criterion for assessing the present occlusion and also for establishing a new occlusal relationship between the upper and the lower jaws. On the other hand, the occlusal position in patients with deformed condyles still remains to be clarified. In this review, the effectiveness and limits of centric relation in these patients are discussed. In addition, the muscle induced occlusal positions, such as the muscular position and the terminal positions of habitual <b>closing</b> <b>movements,</b> are suggested as a substitution for centric relation. Finally, the importance of a stable intercuspal position, where the habitual <b>closing</b> <b>movements</b> terminate without any premature tooth contact, is emphasized...|$|R

40|$|Investigations on {{the role}} of the lateral pterygoid muscle in mandibular {{movements}} have been limited due to difficulties in obtaining consistent neuromuscular recordings in human subjects. The rhesus monkey was used as a substitute experimental animal. Thirty-three Macaca mulatta were monitored in 113 electromyographic recording sessions. Two distinct functional patterns were identified from the region of the lateral pterygoid muscle, depending upon the location of the electrodes within this muscle. Through anatomical dissection of areas of electrode placement in 12 animals, the two patterns of activity were related to the inferior and superior heads of the lateral pterygoid muscle. The inferior head acted synergistically with the suprahyoid muscle group in opening movements of the mandible. No activity was noted in <b>closing</b> <b>movements,</b> or in swallowing. In contrast, the superior head was not active during opening movements. Electromyographic activity of the superior head, antagonistic to the suprahyoid muscles, was observed during such <b>closing</b> <b>movements</b> as chewing and clenching of the teeth and during deglutition. The superior head presumably positioned or stabilized the condylar head and disc against the articular eminence during <b>closing</b> <b>movements</b> of the mandible, while the inferior head assisted in the translation of the condylar head downward, anteriorly, and contralaterally during opening movements. Thus, the two heads of the lateral pterygoid can be considered as two functionally distinct muscles...|$|R

40|$|AIMS: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effects of speech rate changes on kinematic characteristics and stability of speech movements in younger and older speakers using electromagnetic midsagittal articulography. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight young adults and 8 older adults engaged {{in a series of}} syllable repetition tasks of /pa/, /sa/ and /ta/ obtained at self-paced slow, habitual and fast speech rates, as well as in a series of metronome-guided speech rates, ranging from 2 to 4 syllables per second. The kinematic parameters duration, amplitude and peak velocity were obtained for opening and <b>closing</b> <b>movements.</b> RESULTS: Older speakers were able to increase speech rate to the same degree or higher compared to younger speakers in both pacing conditions. Kinematic data show that older adults increased duration and decreased peak velocity in <b>closing</b> <b>movements</b> of alveolar constrictions at slower rates more prominently than younger adults. The results on movement stability revealed no differences between age groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that an age-related difference in speed-accuracy trade-off can be ruled out. Differences in kinematic characteristics point towards the possibility that older adults aimed to facilitate a closed-loop control system to maintain movement stability at slower speech rates...|$|R
