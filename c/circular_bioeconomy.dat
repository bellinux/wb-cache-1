Some of these open significant opportunities to renew industries. This report delivers {{new understanding of}} the potential of circular economy for sustainable renewal of manufacturing in bio-based industries. With particular focus on novel value chains, it provides novel insights {{into the role of}} innovation policies in facilitating the shift towards sustainable, <b>circular</b> <b>bioeconomy</b> in Finland and Sweden. The textile and multi-storey wood construction sectors, and emergent biorefineries are utilised as case studies that deepen understanding of the <b>circular</b> <b>bioeconomy,</b> its opportunities, barriers, and impacts, and the policies that affect its emergence. Recent developments of bioeconomy and circular economy solutions and governance in the Netherlands are also summarised in order to deliver contrasting context to the Nordic focus countries. In this work, the bioeconomy is conceptualised as an economy where the basic building blocks for materials, chemicals and energy are derived from renewable biological resources, such as plant and animal biomass. The essence of the circular economy, that is used here, lies in maximisation of added value and in making the best use of any extracted raw material. This analysis shows that to date discussions and activities related to the promotion of bioeconomy and circular economy have largely been separate efforts, but there are signs that the discussions may converge. It finds that while the form of developments are similar in Finland and in Sweden in the case areas (i. e. textiles, wood construction and biorefineries), there are also clear differences in the strengths of the countries. Evidence is found that such strengths offer potential to develop world leadership in a <b>circular</b> <b>bioeconomy.</b> The report identifies policy recommendations to support renewal of manufacturing in the wood based industries towards a sustainable <b>circular</b> <b>bioeconomy...</b>|$|E
40|$|The global {{demands of}} society to {{increase}} the amount of animal based food, to reduce the environmental impact and to improve animal welfare are developing parallel. In the digitalized world, livestock farming obtains new opportunities to become more efficient, transparent and animal friendly. Information and communication technologies (ICT) dominate innovation in many sectors, including food and agriculture. Farm management needs information and knowledge at different levels, from herd to individuals, to body organs or metabolism. Animals are the starting point and the aim of livestock management at these different levels.

40|$|Despite their evidently {{different}} {{assumptions and}} operationalization strategies, {{the concepts of}} Circular Economy, Green Economy and Bioeconomy are joined by the common ideal to reconcile economic, environmental and social goals. The three concepts are currently mainstreamed in academia and policy making as key sustainability avenues, but a comparative analysis of such concepts is missing. The aim {{of this article is}} thus to comprehensively analyse the diversity within and between such concepts. The results are drawn from a bibliometric review of almost two thousand scientific articles published within the last three decades, coupled with a conceptual analysis. We find that, for what concerns environmental sustainability, Green Economy acts as an 'umbrella' concept, including elements from <b>Circular</b> Economy and <b>Bioeconomy</b> concepts (e. g. eco-efficiency; renewables), as well as additional ideas, e. g. nature-based solutions. In particular, <b>Circular</b> Economy and <b>Bioeconomy</b> are resource-focused, whereas in principle Green Economy acknowledges the underpinning role of all ecological processes. Regarding the social dimension, Green Economy is more inclusive of some aspects at local level (e. g. eco-tourism, education), while there is an emerging discussion in Bioeconomy literature around local processes in terms of biosecurity and rural policies. When considering weak/strong sustainability visions, all concepts remain limited in questioning economic growth. By comparing the different sustainability strategies promoted by these concepts we do not advocate for their substitutability, but for their clarification and reciprocal integration. The findings are discussed in light of the concepts' synergies and limits, with the purpose to inform research and policy implementation. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Life cycle {{thinking}} and {{life cycle assessment}} are vital elements of sustainability assessment and increasingly mentioned as being essential for informing decisions in a comprehensive and holistic manner in both business and policy contexts (Sala et al. 2013). The European Commission has recently released a Communication on Better regulation (CEC, 2015 a) {{in order to improve}} the policy making process. The Communication is complemented with a Better Regulation toolbox (CEC, 2015 b) which lists models and methods to be used for assessing impacts and benefits of policies, in the so called “policy impact assessment” step. Life Cycle Assessment is listed among the models, aiming at supporting the environmental assessment of impact and benefits associated to different policy options (Sala et al. 2016). Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) may play a relevant role all along the policy cycle, from policy anticipation and problem definition, to policy evaluation. Indeed, the life cycle perspective and the systemic approach to the evaluation of options is a crucial added value. However, when the scope of the assessment changes spans from the product (micro) scale to the system (meso-macro) scale, several improvements are required to benefit the most from the LCA methodology. Suitable frameworks, methods and tools for system analysis are needed to properly develop sustainable policies on e. g. <b>bioeconomy,</b> <b>circular</b> economy, resources efficiency, eco-innovation and sustainable production and consumption. This calls for reflecting upon current and future challenges of the application of LCA within the policy development cycle. JRC. D. 1 -Bio-econom...|$|R
40|$|Background Driven by a {{range of}} {{sustainability}} challenges, e. g. climate change, resource depletion and expanding populations, a <b>circular</b> <b>bioeconomy</b> is emerging and expected to evolve progressively in the coming decades. South Africa along with other BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) represents the emerging bioeconomy and contributes significantly to global sugar market. In our research, South Africa {{is used as a}} case study to demonstrate the sustainable design for the future biorefineries annexed to existing sugar industry. Detailed techno-economic evaluation and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) were applied to model alternative routes for converting sugarcane residues (bagasse and trash) to selected biofuel and/or biochemicals (ethanol, ethanol and lactic acid, ethanol and furfural, butanol, methanol and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, with co-production of surplus electricity) in an energy self-sufficient biorefinery system. Results Economic assessment indicated that methanol synthesis with an internal rate of return (IRR) of 16. 7 % and ethanol–lactic acid co-production (20. 5 %) met the minimum investment criteria of 15 %, while the latter had the lowest sensitivity to market price amongst all the scenarios. LCA results demonstrated that sugarcane cultivation was the most significant contributor to environmental impacts in all of the scenarios, other than the furfural production scenario in which a key step, a biphasic process with tetrahydrofuran solvent, had the most significant contribution. Conclusion Overall, the thermochemical routes presented environmental advantages over biochemical pathways on most of the impact categories, except for acidification and eutrophication. Of the investigated scenarios, furfural production delivered the inferior environmental performance, while methanol production performed best due to its low reagent consumption. The combined techno-economic and environmental assessments identified the performance-limiting steps in the 2 G biorefinery design for sugarcane industry and highlighted the technology development opportunities under <b>circular</b> <b>bioeconomy</b> context...|$|E
40|$|The {{world is}} {{confronted with the}} {{depletion}} of natural resources due to their unsustainable use, increased global competiveness, increasing population and other environmental and economic challenges. Under the European 2020 growth strategy launched in 2010, Europe has set itself the goal of shifting from linear to circular models of production and consumption. In this context, food waste management poses a great challenge. This study focusses on the possible destinations for food waste, specifically, on the most sustainable practices that turn waste into valuable resources. Particular attention {{is devoted to the}} potential offered by fast-growing sectors such as the bioeconomy, which is contributing to increased energy and materials production with reduced environmental impact, at the same time creating new job opportunities. In this paper we will argue that an holistic approach considering the issue of food wastage {{as part of a broader}} emerging bio-economy and circular-economic model, might provide win-win solutions able to minimize wastage, promote income growth and job creation, and prompt sustainable local development. However, in order to enable an effective transition to a <b>circular</b> <b>bioeconomy</b> able to minimize the impact of food wastage, the economic, social, and environmental sustainability of this new model must be properly evaluated through appropriate tools, e. g. through an overall Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) ...|$|E
