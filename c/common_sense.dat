5|$|<b>Common</b> <b>Sense</b> Realism {{not only}} {{dominated}} Scottish thought but {{also had a}} major impact in France, the United States, Germany and other countries. Victor Cousin (1792–1867) {{was the most important}} proponent in France, becoming Minister of Education and incorporating the philosophy into the curriculum. In Germany the emphasis on careful observation influenced Humboldt's ideas about science and was {{a major factor in the}} development of German Idealism. James McCosh (1811–94) brought <b>Common</b> <b>Sense</b> Realism directly from Scotland to North American in 1868 when he became president of Princeton University, which soon became a stronghold of the movement. Noah Porter (1811–92) taught <b>Common</b> <b>Sense</b> Realism to generations of students at Yale. As a result, it would be a major influence on the development of one of the most important offshoots of Romanticism in New England, Transcendentalism, particularly in the writing of Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–82).|$|E

50|$|Polysemy {{is a major}} {{obstacle}} for all computer systems that attempt to deal with human language. In English, most frequently used terms have several common meanings. For example, the word fire can mean: a combustion activity; to terminate employment; to launch, or to excite (as in fire up). For the 200 most-polysemous terms in English, the typical verb has more than twelve <b>common</b> meanings, or <b>senses.</b> The typical noun from this set has more than eight <b>common</b> <b>senses.</b> For the 2000 most-polysemous terms in English, the typical verb has more than eight <b>common</b> <b>senses</b> and the typical noun has more than five.|$|R

5|$|Thomas Paine's {{pamphlet}} <b>Common</b> <b>Sense</b> {{was published}} in January 1776, just as it became clear in the colonies that the king was not inclined {{to act as a}} conciliator. Paine had only recently arrived in the colonies from England, and he argued in favor of colonial independence, advocating republicanism as an alternative to monarchy and hereditary rule. <b>Common</b> <b>Sense</b> introduced no new ideas and probably had little direct effect on Congress's thinking about independence; its importance was in stimulating public debate on a topic that few had previously dared to openly discuss. Public support for separation from Great Britain steadily increased after the publication of Paine's enormously popular pamphlet.|$|E

We then synthesize our experience implementing cogni-tive radio control algorithms and extract a set of pragmatic issues challenging researchers in cognitive radios. We conclude with a set of open questions and problems and discuss implications for future research. I...|$|R

30|$|A {{neutral line}} is a crucial {{standard}} against which we can judge {{whether or not a}} network system is vulnerable to spatially localized hazards. Therefore, a proper definition of neutral line is very important to study the spatial vulnerability of a network system. As mentioned before, a threshold is a certain expectation on the impact to the system under a given hazard scenario (specific hazard intensity and size of area covered by hazards). Therefore, it can be defined according to problem characteristics or <b>common</b> <b>senses.</b> For simplicity, in this article, hazard impact is expected proportional to the size of area covered by hazards.|$|R

The detecting circuit adopts a continuous-time current sensing circuit for capacitance measurement, and its noise analysis of the charge amplifier is introduced. The equivalent output noise power spectral density of phase-sensitive demodulation is 120 nV/Hz 1 / 2.

5|$|During the 1890s, Harvard Law School was {{pioneering}} the casebook {{method of}} teaching introduced by Dean Christopher Langdell.

His favorite professor was James Bradley Thayer, who taught him evidence {{in his second year}} and constitutional law in his third. A man of broad interests, Thayer became a major influence on Hand's jurisprudence. He emphasized the law's historical and human dimensions rather than its certainties and extremes. He stressed the need for courts to exercise judicial restraint in deciding social issues.|$|E
5|$|Eliminativism about a {{class of}} {{entities}} is the view that that class of entities does not exist. For example, materialism tends to be eliminativist about the soul; modern chemists are eliminativist about phlogiston; and modern physicists are eliminativist {{about the existence of}} luminiferous aether. Eliminative materialism is the relatively new (1960s–1970s) idea that certain classes of mental entities that <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> takes for granted, such as beliefs, desires, and the subjective sensation of pain, do not exist. The most common versions are eliminativism about propositional attitudes, as expressed by Paul and Patricia Churchland,and eliminativism about qualia (subjective interpretations about particular instances of subjective experience), as expressed by Daniel Dennett and Georges Rey. These philosophers often appeal to an introspection illusion.|$|E
5|$|Intellectually, Scott {{and figures}} like Thomas Carlyle {{played a part}} in the {{development}} of historiography and the idea of the historical imagination.

Scottish philosophy was dominated by Scottish <b>Common</b> <b>Sense</b> Realism, which shared some characteristics with Romanticism and was a major influence on the development of Transcendentalism. Scott also played a major part in defining Scottish and British politics, helping to create a romanticised view of Scotland and the Highlands that fundamentally changed Scottish national identity.|$|E

30|$|In {{all these}} applications, {{the primary goal}} of a WSN is to collect useful {{information}} by monitoring phenomena in the surrounding environment. <b>Common</b> <b>sensing</b> tasks are heat, pressure, light, sound, vibration, presence of objects, etc. In WSNs, each sensor individually senses the local environment, but col-laboratively achieves complex information gathering and dissemination tasks. Typically a WSN follows the communication pattern of convergecast, where sensors -source nodes- generate data about a phenomenon and relay streams of data to a more resource rich device called sink. This procedure is called data dissemination, which is a preplanned way of distributing data and queries of sinks among the sensors.|$|R
