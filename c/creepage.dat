Johnson presented an approximate approach for the 3D frictional problem with Hertzian geometry, with either lateral or spin <b>creepage.</b> Among others he found that spin <b>creepage,</b> which is symmetric about {{the center of the}} contact patch, leads to a net lateral force in rolling conditions. This is due to the fore-aft differences in the distribution of tractions in the contact patch.|$|E

The paper presents an analysis of the effects of <b>creepages</b> on wheel rail contact forces. A complete Australia wagon with three-piece bogies was modelled and various tracks were selected for the simulation of dynamic wheel rail contact stresses.

30|$|It can be {{seen from}} the {{expressions}} above that the radius of the roller and the shift angle (function of yaw) contribute to the differences in terms of <b>creepages</b> and spin with respect to wheel-rail contact condition. The corresponding expressions for wheel-rail contact condition can be obtained by setting s 0  = ∞ and β =  0. Moreover, the longitudinal and lateral <b>creepages</b> can be simplified further by assuming that the contacting bodies remain in contact at all times which means the z components vanish in the expressions (35) and (36).|$|R

In order to properly reproduce the experimentally observed behavior, a Multi-Body vehicle {{model has been}} implemented taking into account torsional deformability of the driveline and of the wheelsets. An extension of the Shen-Hedrick-Elkins model has also been proposed and integrated into the model for reproducing the decreasing section of the creep force-creep curve experimentally measured at high <b>creepages</b> and responsible for the driveline torsional vibrations. In particular a temperature dependant friction coefficient has been introduced into the Shen-Hedrick-Elkins model to explain the decrease of creep forces at high <b>creepages...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{traction}} {{characteristic of}} the wheel-rail contact is of high importance, e. g., for vehicle dynamics, and for the transmission of forces during traction and braking. This characteristic is influenced by fast changes of mechanical parameters, e. g., <b>creepages,</b> normal loads and coefficient of friction during {{the movement of the}} train. CONTACT, which is based on Kalker’s Theory, is able to describe these unsteady effects for low <b>creepages</b> (there are adhesion and slip at the same time) but it is unsuitable for Multi Body System (MBS) simulations due to its high computational effort. Therefore, a linearised model, called Unsteady Brush Model (UBM), is presented in this thesis {{that can be used in}} combination with MBS software. The results of the UBM agree qualitatively with the results of CONTAC...|$|R
30|$|From a {{mathematical}} point of view, the contact {{problem can be}} solved for both wheel-rail and wheel-roller contact according to the following four steps [11, 12]. The {{first step is to}} solve the geometrical problem, in which the locations of the contact points on the contacting bodies are determined. This is followed by solving the normal contact problem, in which the shape and size of the contact patch formed in the contact interface due to body deformation and the corresponding pressure distribution over the contact patch are determined. The third step is to deal with the kinematic problem, in which normalized kinematic quantities, the so-called <b>creepages,</b> are determined. These quantities measure the relative velocities between the contacting bodies at the contact points. In the final step, the tangential problem is solved; this concerns the prediction of tangential stresses at the contact interface which is generated by friction and <b>creepages</b> within the contact zone [11, 13, 14]. All these steps need to be dealt with differently for the case of wheel-roller contact compared to the wheel-rail case, as described in the next section.|$|R
50|$|In {{analysing}} {{the dynamics}} of wheelsets and complete rail vehicles, the contact forces can be treated as linearly dependent on the creep (Kalker's linear theory, valid for small <b>creepage)</b> or more advanced theories can be used from frictional contact mechanics.|$|E
50|$|Dirt, pollution, salt, and {{particularly}} {{water on the}} surface of a high voltage insulator can create a conductive path across it, causing leakage currents and flashovers. The flashover voltage can be reduced by more than 50% when the insulator is wet. High voltage insulators for outdoor use are shaped to maximise the length of the leakage path along the surface {{from one end to the}} other, called the <b>creepage</b> length, to minimise these leakage currents. To accomplish this the surface is moulded into a series of corrugations or concentric disc shapes. These usually include one or more sheds; downward facing cup-shaped surfaces that act as umbrellas to ensure that the part of the surface leakage path under the 'cup' stays dry in wet weather. Minimum <b>creepage</b> distances are 20-25 mm/kV, but must be increased in high pollution or airborne sea-salt areas.|$|E

5000|$|In 1967 Joost Kalker {{published}} his milestone PhD thesis on the linear theory for rolling contact. [...] This theory is exact {{for the situation}} of an infinite friction coefficient {{in which case the}} slip area vanishes, and is approximative for non-vanishing <b>creepages.</b> It does assume Coulomb’s friction law, which more or less requires (scrupulously) clean surfaces. This theory is for massive bodies such as the railway wheel-rail contact. With respect to road-tire interaction, an important contribution concerns the so-called magic tire formula by Hans Pacejka.|$|R
40|$|To get a deep {{insight into}} bogie {{suspension}} design, {{it is important}} to identify those wheelset dynamics states and running conditions that can influence contact mechanics and wear, remarkably. In this regard, global sensitivity analysis of wheel/rail contact <b>creepages,</b> forces, and wear with respect to wheelset dynamics states, vehicle speed, and normal contact force is scrutinized. The Gaussian quadrature integrals together with multiplicative dimension reduction method (M-DRM) are employed to approximate the global sensitivity indices of wheel/rail contact mechanics. Using simulation results of a one car railway vehicle model, a feasible state vector is chosen as the cut center for sensitivity analysis of a single rigid wheelset with 6 degrees of freedom. The state vector, speed, and normal contact force are varied around the cut center according to a predefined set of independent and identically distributed random numbers. A computational model is developed to attain the contact point positions on wheel and rail as well as nonlinear <b>creepages.</b> The corresponding contact stimuli vector is obtained using FASTSIM algorithm and wear is modelled as the energy dissipation in the contact patch. The wheelset dynamics effects on wheel/rail contact mechanics are then explored. The results showed wear is mostly sensitive with respect to yaw motion and lateral speed of the wheelset. Such an analysis provides informative data {{that can be used in}} vibration control and suspension design in railway applications...|$|R

50|$|Polymer {{insulators}} {{by nature}} have hydrophobic characteristics providing for improved wet performance. Also, {{studies have shown}} that the specific <b>creepage</b> distance required in polymer insulators is much lower than that required in porcelain or glass. Additionally, the mass of polymer insulators (especially in higher voltages) is approximately 50% to 30% less than that of a comparative porcelain or glass string. Better pollution and wet performance is leading to the increased use of such insulators.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the comparison of}} dynamic behavior of a wheelset on roller and on rails. The development of equations of kinematics and motion allow to put in evidence the intrinsic differences between the dynamic behavior on rail and on roller. The stylized conical profile approximation of the wheel allows to focus the attention on the differences in <b>creepages</b> definition and in contact point shift due to the roller curvature. The treatise is addressed to a full scale roller and can be extended {{in the case of}} scaled roller rig to be applied {{in the case of the}} test bench developed for experimental analysis.

40|$|Train–track {{interaction}} {{has been}} extensively studied in the last 40 years at least, leading to modelling approaches that can deal satisfactorily with many dynamic problems arising at the wheel/rail interface. However, the available models are usually not considering specifically the running dynamics of the vehicle in a curve, whereas a number of train–track interaction phenomena are specific to curve negotiation. The aim {{of this paper is}} to define a model for a flexible wheelset running on a flexible curved track. The main novelty of this work is to combine a trajectory coordinate set with Eulerian modal coordinates; the former permits to consider curved tracks, and the latter models the small relative displacements between the trajectory frame and the solid. In order to reduce the computational complexity of the problem, one single flexible wheelset is considered instead of one complete bogie, and suitable forces are prescribed at the primary suspension seats so that the mean values of the <b>creepages</b> and contact forces are consistent with the low frequency curving dynamics of the complete vehicle. The wheelset model is coupled to a cyclic track model having constant curvature by means of a wheel/rail contact model which accounts for the actual geometry of the contacting profiles and for the nonlinear relationship between <b>creepages</b> and creep forces. The proposed model can be used to analyse a variety of dynamic problems for railway vehicles, including rail corrugation and wheel polygonalisation, squeal noise, numerical estimation of the wheelset service loads. In this paper, simulation results are presented for some selected running conditions to exemplify the application of the model to the study of realistic train–track interaction cases and to point out the importance of curve negotiation effects specifically addressed in the work...|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide a {{thorough}} examination of the differences between these two contact cases from a mathematical point of view and to find the influence factors of the differences for better translating the test results on the roller rig to the field test. To this aim, a new approach for solving the normal contact problem for the wheel-roller couple is proposed, and the expressions of the <b>creepages</b> and spin are obtained for the wheel-roller couple. The results of this new approach are presented comparing the case of the wheelset running on a standard track and on rollers, and the differences between these two cases are discussed in the light of their effects on surface damage and degradation occurring in the wheels and the rails.|$|R

50|$|Suspension {{insulators}} {{are made}} of multiple units, {{with the number of}} unit insulator disks increasing at higher voltages. The number of disks is chosen based on line voltage, lightning withstand requirement, altitude, and environmental factors such as fog, pollution, or salt spray. In cases where these conditions are suboptimal, longer insulators must be used. Longer insulators with longer <b>creepage</b> distance for leakage current, are required in these cases. Strain insulators must be strong enough mechanically to support the full weight of the span of conductor, as well as loads due to ice accumulation, and wind.|$|E
40|$|Railway {{turnouts}} (switches and crossings) {{require more}} maintenance than {{other parts of}} the railway network. Multiple wheel–rail contacts are common, and impact loads with large magnitudes are generated when the conventional wheel–rail contact conditions are disturbed at various locations along the turnout. The dynamic interaction between train and turnout is simulated in order to predict the forces and <b>creepages</b> in the wheel–rail contacts, and the sizes and locations of the contact patches. Furthermore, the change in rail profile because of plastic deformation is calculated by finite element analysis at a selected position along the switch rail. Contact loads and contact locations, taken from the vehicle dynamics simulation, are then used as input data in the finite element analysis. The objective of the study is to gain knowledge about the influence of different damage mechanisms on the life of a turnout. This is useful in an optimization of turnout geometry with the purpose to improve vehicle ride dynamics and to decrease maintenance costs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a comprehensive multibody model of the twin disk test rig using the modular approach. The mathematical models for electrical and mechanical components and wheel and rail rollers are implemented using SimPowerSystems, SimDriveline and Simulink toolboxes. The static and dynamic responses of the rollers are measured with load cells and strain gauges. The experimental data show that the creep forces saturate in the low and very low adhesion conditions at the points where the <b>creepages</b> are large enough to give saturation. Also the lateral position and yaw angle are sufficient to capture the key stability and guidance aspects of the vehicle system dynamics. There is a close correlation between the simulated and measured lateral creep forces so the proposed multibody model is validated. The model represents an important contribution to railway condition monitoring techniques and predictive maintenance methods because it can be easily employed in hardware-in-the-loop applications allowing accurate estimation of forces acting on the wheel-rail interface...|$|R
40|$|When {{an elastic}} body of {{revolution}} rolls tractively over another, the period from commencement of rolling until gross rolling ensues is termed the prerolling regime. The resultant tractions in this regime are characterized by rate-independent hysteresis behavior with nonlocal memory in function of the traversed displacement. This paper {{is dedicated to the}} theoretical characterization of traction during prerolling. Firstly, a theory is developed to calculate the traction field during prerolling in function of the instantaneous rolling displacement, the imposed longitudinal, lateral and spin <b>creepages,</b> and the elastic contact parameters. Secondly, the theory is implemented in a numerical scheme to calculate the resulting traction forces and moments on the tractive rolling of a ball. Thirdly, the basic hysteresis characteristics are systematically established by means of influence-parameters simulations using dimensionless forms of the problem parameters. The results obtained are consistent with the limiting cases available in literature and they confirm experimental prerolling hysteresis observations. Furthermore, in a second paper, this theory is validated experimentally for the case of V-grooved track...|$|R
5000|$|The device {{consists}} of a molded plastic housing that attaches {{to the end of}} an electrical conduit that carries the underground cables up the utility pole to the crossarm. Multiple bushing insulators project from the plastic body, each ending at an electrical terminal. Each overhead wire is connected to a bushing terminal from which the current passes through a rod {{down the center of the}} bushing to the interior of the housing, where it is connected to a wire from the conduit. Thus the device allows the overhead conductors to pass into the conduit while serving as a seal to keep out water. The purpose of the bushings, which have corrugations moulded into their surfaces, is to provide enough <b>creepage</b> distance along their surface to prevent leakage current from the high voltage terminal from flowing to the grounded metal conduit.|$|E
50|$|When {{using this}} type of stator design, lining the slot with {{insulation}} paper is not required. The plastic end plates are designed {{in a way that}} the sides of the injected shafts insulate half of the stator slot. It is also beneficial, that costs for paper as well as costs for the production process for the mounting of the paper do not arise. Under consideration of a certain wall thickness of these injected shafts, z-shaped overlapping of the shafts in the area of the stator nut center may be achieved in order to increase the <b>creepage</b> distance and clearance to avoid dielectric breakdowns. However, a disadvantage constitutes in the fact that the depth of the shot of the injection process is limited depending on the stator lengths and the plastic material used.When e.g. using PA with a solid material content (e.g. glass fibers) of approx. 25% and a shot of approx. 25 mm depth, a wall thickness of at least 0.5 mm may be achieved. However, it has negative repercussions on the fill factor compared to the use of insulation paper which e.g. is only 0.1 mm thick.|$|E
50|$|The {{physical}} layout of an opto-isolator depends {{primarily on the}} desired isolation voltage. Devices rated {{for less than a}} few kV have planar (or sandwich) construction. The sensor die is mounted directly on the lead frame of its package (usually, a six-pin or a four-pin dual in-line package). The sensor is covered with a sheet of glass or clear plastic, which is topped with the LED die. The LED beam fires downward. To minimize losses of light, the useful absorption spectrum of the sensor must match the output spectrum of the LED, which almost invariably lies in the near infrared. The optical channel is made as thin as possible for a desired breakdown voltage. For example, to be rated for short-term voltages of 3.75 kV and transients of 1 kV/μs, the clear polyimide sheet in the Avago ASSR-300 series is only 0.08 mm thick. Breakdown voltages of planar assemblies depend on the thickness of the transparent sheet and the configuration of bonding wires that connect the dies with external pins. Real in-circuit isolation voltage is further reduced by <b>creepage</b> over the PCB and the surface of the package. Safe design rules require a minimal clearance of 25 mm/kV for bare metal conductors or 8.3 mm/kV for coated conductors.|$|E
40|$|As part of RSSB's {{research}} programme, AEA Technology Rail {{have been}} developing {{a model of}} rolling contact fatigue (RCF) crack initiation. The existing model was developed following a number of detailed RCF site surveys and subsequent vehicle dynamics modelling of vehicles passing each site. It uses the forces and <b>creepages</b> developed in the contact patch, characterised by the energy parameter (also called the wear number), T&# 0947;, to quantify the RCF fatigue damage generated at each contact position. The model was developed largely empirically, but {{has been found to}} give good predictions of the locations where RCF cracks develop in normal grade rails. The objective of the research was to increase the understanding of the mechanisms of crack initiation and to underpin and improve the existing energy-based fatigue model of RCF. Work was also undertaken to analyse the effect of material properties on the RCF resistance so that a similar function could be developed for other rail materials. These objectives were achieved through utilisation of fundamental ratchetting and fracture mechanics fatigue models of wear-fatigue interaction developed at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne...|$|R
40|$|An {{optimization}} problem is formulated {{to attain the}} vector of optimized primary suspension passive dampers of a bogie {{in order to minimize}} wear in railway applications. A mechanical system with five degrees of freedom (DOF) comprising a single rigid wheelset attached to a fixed bogie frame is chosen to explore the effects of primary suspension damping components on wear. Different operational scenarios including tangent and curved tracks together with different levels of track irregularities are introduced to be used as inputs to model. The equations of motion of the system are obtained and the FASTSIM algorithm is employed to relate the <b>creepages</b> and the corresponding creep forces in different directions. At vehicle maximum admissible speed and a given set of operational scenarios, the optimized values of the primary suspension passive dampers in longitudinal, lateral and vertical directions are found through a genetic algorithm optimization routine in MATLAB. The outcomes of current research can not only be used to minimize wear in railway operation as well as reduce track access charges and maintenance costs, but also give insight into designing adaptive bogies...|$|R
40|$|The {{numerical}} wheel wear prediction in railway applications is {{of great}} importance for different aspects, such as the safety against vehicle instability and derailment, the planning of wheelset maintenance interventions and the design of an optimal wheel profile from the wear point of view. For these reasons, this paper presents a complete model aimed at {{the evaluation of the}} wheel wear and the wheel profile evolution by means of dynamic simulations, organised in two parts which interact with each other mutually: a vehicle's dynamic model and a model for the wear estimation. The first is a 3 D multibody model of a railway vehicle implemented in SIMPACK™, a commercial software for the analysis of mechanical systems, where the wheel–rail interaction is entrusted to a C/C++user routine external to SIMPACK, in which the global contact model is implemented. In this regard, the research on the contact points between the wheel and the rail is based on an innovative algorithm developed by the authors in previous works, while normal and tangential forces in the contact patches are calculated according to Hertz's theory and Kalker's global theory, respectively. Due to the numerical efficiency of the global contact model, the multibody vehicle and the contact model interact directly online during the dynamic simulations. The second is the wear model, written in the MATLAB® environment, mainly based on an experimental relationship between the frictional power developed at the wheel–rail interface and the amount of material removed by wear. Starting from a few outputs of the multibody simulations (position of contact points, contact forces and rigid <b>creepages),</b> it evaluates the local variables, such as the contact pressures and local <b>creepages,</b> using a local contact model (Kalker's FASTSIM algorithm). These data are then passed to another subsystem which evaluates, by means of the considered experimental relationship, both the material to be removed and its distribution along the wheel profile, obtaining the correspondent worn wheel geometry. The wheel wear evolution is reproduced by dividing the overall chosen mileage to be simulated in discrete spatial steps: at each step, the dynamic simulations are performed by means of the 3 D multibody model keeping the wheel profile constant, while the wheel geometry is updated through the wear model only {{at the end of the}} discrete step. Thus, the two parts of the whole model work alternately until the completion of the whole established mileage. Clearly, the choice of an appropriate step length is one of the most important aspects of the procedure and it directly affects the result accuracy and the required computational time to complete the analysis. The whole model has been validated using experimental data relative to tests performed with the ALn 501 ‘Minuetto’ vehicle in service on the Aosta–Pre Saint Didier track; this work has been carried out thanks to a collaboration with Trenitalia S. p. A and Rete Ferroviaria Italiana, which have provided the necessary technical data and experimental results...|$|R
