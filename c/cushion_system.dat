50|$|Development of {{the craft}} was not straightforward, having posed several {{challenges}} and difficulties {{that needed to be}} overcome from the onset. Early on, one criticism of the Model A was that the single annular peripheral jet engine would be incapable of adequate pitch and roll stability while the diagonal stability jets featured on Cockerell's original model had been eliminated; however Saunders-Roe's aerodynamics office were confident that the design was good. In part to answer these doubts, a three-dimensional model was produced and subjected to wind tunnel tests, which revealed extreme instability. A 'stop design' order was promptly issued on the <b>cushion</b> <b>system</b> while further tests were performed, which determined that the addition of single peripheral jets remained inadequate for the original design. As the use of transverse jets, as used on the original model, was impractical, an extended planform was adopted along with an additional peripheral jet along the outside to address the stability issue. After further model testing, the bottom surface was inclined at a shallow 6-degree angle as well.|$|E

40|$|Crash {{cushions}} {{are deployed}} at gores {{and in front}} of other fixed objects along the roadway when their proximity to the travelled way poses an unacceptable risk to the travelling public. A crash cushion is intended to act as a deformable shield that causes an errant vehicle to decelerate more slowly, dramatically reducing the potential severity of injuries suffered by vehicle occupants. This paper formulates the design of such a system as a constrained optimization problem which is solved using contemporary search techniques implemented in commercial software. The methodology is demonstrated on high-molecular-weight, high-density polyethylene (HMW/HDPE) cylinders arrayed in a single line to form a crash cushion which carries the trade name REACT? 350 system. The wall thickness of each cylinder in the array is treated as a design variable. The diameter of the cylinders and the total number in the array are treated as parameters and not directly addressed by the optimization process. A simple one dimensional array of masses and nonlinear springs are used to simulate the dynamic interaction of a vehicle and the <b>cushion</b> <b>system</b> and yield a value for the Occupant Impact Velocity (OVI) and Ride Down Acceleration (RDA) for a given set of cylinder parameters. Prescribed upper limits on OVI and RDA under impact of two standard mass vehicles form the four implicit, nonlinear constraints in the problem.

40|$|The {{majority}} of mechanical damage to packages or products in shipment can be ascribed to {{shocks and vibrations}} experienced during transportation. Vibrations can cause resonance, which {{has the potential to}} damage the product or cause the failure of critical elements within due to the repetitive application of stresses. The response behaviour of cushioning or protective packaging materials under vibration excitation is central to the effective design of product packaging. The response characteristics of the cushioning material guide the design parameters of the product-transport <b>cushion</b> <b>system.</b> Conventionally, this is achieved by the measurement of the transmissibility or Frequency Response Function (FRF) of the product/cushion system by a Single Input-Single Output (SISO) approach assuming a linear relationship. However, the product/cushion system can exhibit strong nonlinear behaviour. The Reverse Multiple Input-Single Output (R-MISO) approach has shown a greater ability to more accurately characterise the nonlinear package/cushion system. This greater accuracy will allow for the use of fewer materials with the benefit of cost and environmental savings. The R-MISO approach revealed {{a significant difference in the}} natural frequency estimate between the SISO linear assumption and the linear frequency response function estimate of the R-MISO approach. A considerable difference in the magnitude of the transmissibility at the estimated natural frequency was also shown. These differences were accompanied by an improvement in coherence. This work adds to the knowledge of the package designer through the study of the significance of the nonlinear behavior of a common cushioning material using the R-MISO method. This new approach to the vibration analysis of cushioning materials will allow the package designer to assess the nonlinear behavior of a packaging material...|$|E
40|$|Background: To compare {{thermoplastic}} masks (TMP) and vacuum <b>cushion</b> <b>system</b> (VCS) {{to assess}} differences in interfraction set up accuracy in patients treated with stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT) for oligometastatic lung cancer. Secondarily, to survey radiotherapy technologists {{to assess their}} satisfaction with the two systems. Methods: Retrospective study of patients treated with lung SBRT between 2008 to 2012 at our institution. Immobilization was performed for 73 treatment sessions (VCS[*]=[*] 40; TMP[*]=[*] 33). A total of 246 cone-beams were analysed. Patients considered ineligible for surgery with a life expectancy ≥ 6 months and performance status[*]>[*] 1 were included. Target lesion location was verified by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) prior to each session, with displacements assessed by CBCT simulation prior to each treatment session. Couch shifts were registered prospectively in vertical, longitudinal, and latero-lateral directions to obtain Kernel coordinates (3 D representation). Technologists were surveyed to assess their satisfaction with indexing, positioning, and learning curve of the two systems. Setup displacements were obtained in all patients for each treatment plan and for each session. To assess differences between the immobilization systems, a t-test (Welch) was performed. Results: Mean displacements for the TMP and VC systems, respectively, were as follows: session one, 0. 64 cm vs 1. 05 cm (p[*]=[*] 0. 0002); session two, 0. 49 cm vs 1. 02 cm (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001), and session three, 0. 56 vs 0. 97 cm (p[*]=[*] 0. 0011). TMP resulted in significantly smaller shifts vs. VCS in all three treatment sessions. Technologists rated the learning curve, set up, and positioning more highly for TMP versus VCS. Conclusions: Due to the high doses and steep gradients in lung SBRT, accurate and reproducible inter-fraction set up is essential. We found that thermoplastic masks offers better reproducibility with significantly less interfractional set up displacement than vacuum cushions. Moreover, radiotherapy technologists rated the TMP system higher. Taken together, these two findings suggest that TMP may be preferable to VCS. However, {{more research is needed}} to determine both inter- and intrafraction error to identify the optimal immobilisation system for use in lung SBRT...|$|E
40|$|During the {{distribution}} phase, products are often {{exposed to a}} variety of environmental hazards which, if excessively severe, may cause damage to and even destroy the product. Among those, mechanical shocks are potentially the most damaging and effective cushion design requires that the maximum expected shock level be defined. This is usually determined by estimating the statistical likelihood of a certain design drop height from data describing the probability of occurrence. In the most cases, such statistical distributions are constructed using limited sets of data and, as such, cannot represent all possible drop heights. Even if some extreme drop height were included in the sampled data, it is often the case that such events are considered unlikely to occur and are thus discounted to attain an engineering and economic compromise.
