40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} approaches to Java acceleration in embedded systems is a bytecode-to-C ahead-of-time compiler (AOTC). It improves the performance of a Java virtual machine (JVM) by translating bytecode into C code, which is then compiled into machine code via an existing C compiler. One important design issue in AOTC is efficient exception handling. Since the excepting point and the exception handler may locate in different methods on a call stack, control transfer between them should be streamlined, while an exception would be an “exceptional ” event, so it should not slow down normal execution paths. Previous AOTCs often employed stack cutting based on a setjmp() /longjmp(), which we found is involved with too much overheads. This paper proposes a simpler solution based on an exception check after each method call, merged with garbage <b>collection</b> <b>check</b> for reducing its overhead. Our evaluation results on SPECjvm 98 on Sun’s CVM indicate that our technique can improve the performance of stack cutting by more than 25 %...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{the most}} {{utilization}} of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), available models yield efficiency score corresponding to each Decision Making Unit (DMU). Indeed, in classical models, a DMU {{had its own}} input and outputs, and these data had direct effect on the corresponding unit. But in the model we're examining, some inputs are used for some components in common, and the whole components are used to make some outputs. However, in most of real cases, efficiency {{is a function of}} various shared resources in decision making units. In this article, the efficiency four Banks in six periods has been examined and indices in question. This article includes debt ratio, flow of capital resources ratio, average period of <b>collection</b> <b>check</b> of banks and capital efficiency. So the components of capital structure, profitability and growth have been known like the components that use the specific and common indices. At last, the relative efficiency of units has been calculated financially. In this article to calculate the efficiency of a decision making unit four components have been used until the specific efficiency of single component has been determined individually, and its efficiency without the effect of other indices have been found. Finally, the aggregate efficiency of all components has been recognized. In this method we focus on finding the inefficient components in an efficient DMU, and also we can exactly determine which of the inefficient components makes a DMU inefficient. To continue, the preface of data envelopment analysis, ratios and methods used in banking and the models of multi components efficiency with shared resource will be presented. Finally, performing of this model will be discussed in Iranian banks...|$|E

High academic performance, which is measured by continuous assessment and examination results, is one of the major goals of higher education. However many students experience difficulty during their second year of study at the university used in this study. Aim: The overall aim of the study is to assess whether the identified predictor variables (cognitive, non-cognitive and demographic) influence academic performance of second-year nursing students at the University of the Western Cape. Methodology: A non-experimental quantitative research approach with a cross-sectional predictive design was applied. The selected sample (n= 226) included all first-time enrolled Bachelor of Nursing students for the years 2012 – 2013 at the University of the Western Cape. An all-inclusive sampling method was applied. Data were obtained from the Student Administrative System Integrated and recorded in the data <b>collection</b> <b>check</b> list. Statistical Package for Social Sciences software version 23. 0 was used sort and analyse the data. Simple and multiple linear regression were done. Ethics: Permission to conduct the present research study at the University of the Western Cape was obtained from the Registrar and the Director of The School of Nursing. The Research Ethics Committee of the University of the Western Cape granted ethics approval related to the research. The researcher maintained the principles of anonymity and confidentiality throughout the study. Results: The study found that the cognitive predictor variables had the strongest predictive power in association with student performance in comparison to the non-cognitive predictors and demographic variable, besides race which rejected the null hypothesis. Conclusion: The findings provided evidence to the School of Nursing to assist them in identifying students who may be at risk of unsatisfactory academic performance and who ultimately fail to proceed to the next level of study...|$|E

40|$|The Federal Reserve’s check {{clearing}} {{business has been}} a significant part of its operations since its founding and has set the precedent for other payment services offered by the Federal Reserve (Fed) to depository institutions. While there is considerable debate about the proper role for the Fed in the modern payment system, there seems to be much less disagreement concerning the Fed’s entry into <b>check</b> <b>collection.</b> 1 Many scholars believe that when the Fed took on the check payment function during {{the first decade of the}} institution’s existence, its entry served to enhance the efficiency of the check payment system. Indeed, Fed documents on its role in the payment system speak of the “breakdown of the <b>check</b> <b>collection</b> system ” around the turn of the century. 2 According to the conventional view, <b>check</b> <b>collection</b> prior to the founding of the Fed was decentralized and defective in a number of ways. By centralizing the system, the Fed was able to eliminate many of the defects. Our purpose in this article is to reexamine the facts concerning the Fed’s entry into {{check clearing}} and to evaluate the conventional view in light of those facts. We find that the evidence of inefficiency in the pre-Fed <b>check</b> <b>collection</b> system is inconclusive. Further, inefficiency would imply that there was some form of market failure, yet most discussions of check clearing in the early part of this century are vague or silent on possible sources of market failure. Absent a clearly articulated explanation of why participants in the <b>check</b> <b>collection</b> system failed to achieve efficient results, we find the conventional view to be unconvincing.

This article focuses on another example, specifically on how a sweeping change to an obscure banking rule regulating the <b>check</b> <b>collection</b> process has negatively affected consumers in general, and minority groups in particular. U. S. <b>check</b> <b>collections</b> require a complex system comprised of a variety of institutions including commercial banks, savings and loans, savings banks, and credit unions, as well as the customers who rely upon them to collect payments from far and near. Traditionally, the <b>check</b> <b>collection</b> process, including the timing rules under U. C. C. Article Four, was inherently cumbersome and slow to honor the payee’s right to receive immediate payment of funds from the paying bank. Frustration among payees, which grew due to not having their funds available fast enough because of delays that were inherent within the system, led lawmakers and others to reform the <b>check</b> <b>collection</b> timing rules [...] It has now been more than twenty years since Congress passed the Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFAA), which empowered the Federal Reserve Board of Governors to regulate the speed with which commercial banks are required to make funds available to depositors after their checks were deposited for collection. There is evidence, however, that these reforms have had an negative impact on checking account customers as a whole, but in particular, a disproportionate impact on minority communities. Specifically, by reducing the maximum amount of waiting time between the date of deposit and the date when funds are available to deposit customers, the reforms also reduced the time that the funds were available to the check-issuing consumer. Thus, in every checking transaction, checking account customers lost the benefit of the float that was built into every transaction under the traditional U. C. C. rules. It is my thesis, therefore, that recent reforms in the timing rules that regulate the speed of the <b>check</b> <b>collection</b> process have indeed reduced the wait time for funds to be available, but have also resulted in increases in the appetite for various risky cash management alternatives by consumers to obtain the money that under old timing rules would stay in their deposit accounts for a longer period. Put another way, consumers who issued checks liked float, too! To address this problem, I will propose two recommendations that can provide a remedy for consumers, at their option. First, that the definition of “check” should be changed under both state and federal commercial law to remove the limitation that all checks are due on demand. Second, I propose that the federal <b>check</b> <b>collection</b> timing rules should be amended to require banks to honor checks that are payable on a definite due date just as they honor those that are payable on demand...|$|R

Currently, in Afghanistan design - build and traditional procurement systems are the two main procurement systems used to deliver highway projects. Highway clients, however; have not been fully satisfied with the Afghan industry’s abilities to complete their projects on time, within the budget and to an acceptable quality. Clients’ needs and expectations require an assessme nt {{of the performance of}} the design and build, and the traditional project delivery systems for highway projects.

Data sources included the World Weather Records, Monthly Climatic Data for the World Bulletins, the Global Historical Climate Network and the electronic meteorological report archives of Environment Canada. Much of the earlier data was in paper form and had to be digitized by hand. Over 66, 000 individual mean monthly pressure values were obtained, with a missing value rate of 5. 9 %. The homogenisation procedures used were the Standard Normal Homogeneity Test (SNHT; Alexandersson and Moberg 1997) and Multiple Comparison Analysis (MCA; as used by Slonosky et al 1999). In addition, simple subtraction of sea-level pressure from station-level pressure revealed a major inhomogeneity which took place in 1977, when computer generated pressure reduction tables were used for the first time by the Meteorological Service of Canada, and when the meteorological reporting procedure was brought into alignment with the World Meteorological Organisation’s guidelines. As a result, the final homogenised database shows appreciable differences in trends compared to the unhomogenised series. The final database has been used by Slonosky & Graham (2003) in the statistical analysis of trends and variability of surface pressure across Canada during the 20 th century.

In order {{to resolve this}} controversy, we have assessed endogenous nitrosation by the independent N-nitrosoproline excretion test in subjects who had previously undergone gastric juice analysis by one of these methods. Ten Polya gastrectomy, 10 pernicious anaemia and nine matched control subjects were fed 380 mg of nitrate in beetroot juice and 500 mg proline. N-nitrosoproline (N-Pro) synthesised intragastrically from these precursors, and quantitatively excreted by the kidneys, was measured in 24 hour urine samples (<b>collection</b> <b>checked</b> by creatinine clearance). N-Pro excretion (mean +/- SEM) was reduced (p less than 0. 01) in pernicious anaemia (1. 1 +/- 0. 8 ng/day) compared with matched control (18. 0 +/- 7. 2 ng/day), and also tended to be lower (NS) in polya gastrectomy (3. 2 +/- 2. 3 ng/day). Twenty four hour intragastric pH was monitored on a separate occasion in 23 of the 29 subjects; 13 were hypoacidic (pH greater than 4 greater than 50 % of 24 hours) and 10 were acidic. N-Pro yields were reduced (p less than 0. 01) in the hypoacidic group (0. 9 +/- 0. 6 ng/day) compared with the acidic group (17. 9 +/- 6. 6 ng/day), and N-Pro was negatively associated with mean intragastric pH (tau = - 0. 53, p = 0. 001). We conclude that endogenous synthesis of this specific N-nitroso compound is favoured by low rather than high pH. These results are concordant with those previously reported in gastric juice from the same subjects and suggest that nitrosation is chemically rather than bacterially mediated, contrary to the nitrosamine hypothesis of gastric carcinogenesis...|$|R
