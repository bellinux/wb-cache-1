5|$|The Maya leader {{returned}} {{the following day}} with twelve canoes, as promised. The Spanish <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> afar that the shore was packed with natives. The conquistadors put ashore in the brigantine and the ships' boats; {{a few of the}} more daring Spaniards boarded the native canoes. The Spanish named the headland Cape Catoche, after some words spoken by the Maya leader, which sounded to the Spanish like cones catoche. Once ashore, the Spaniards clustered loosely together and advanced towards the city along a path among low, scrub-covered hillocks. At this point the Maya leader gave a shout and the Spanish party was ambushed by Maya warriors armed with spears, bows and arrows, and stones. Thirteen Spaniards were injured by arrows in the first assault, but the conquistadors regrouped and repulsed the Maya attack. They advanced to a small plaza bordered by temples upon the outskirts of the city. When the Spaniards ransacked the temples they found a number of low-grade gold items, which filled them with enthusiasm. The expedition captured two Mayas to be used as interpreters and retreated to the ships. Over the following days the Spanish discovered that although the Maya arrows had struck with little force, the flint arrowheads tended to shatter on impact, causing infected wounds and a slow death; two of the wounded Spaniards died from the arrow-wounds inflicted in the ambush.|$|E

In the early morning the Japanese launched a strong counter-attack from the south and south-east of 'C' Company's position. Amidst heavy fighting, the Japanese fought their way into the two forward Australian pits and close quarters fighting ensued. After an hour, the attack was repulsed with artillery support and at first light on the Australians sent out patrols, which found the ridge abandoned. Throughout the morning and into the early afternoon, the Australians undertook mopping up operations before the ridge was finally cleared in the early afternoon.

500|$|By mid-2000s, the Ballymun towers were in {{the process}} of being torn down, and the Ballymun area was the target of a €1.8billion {{regeneration}} scheme intended to create a self-sustaining community of 30,000 people that would be more successful than the original 1960s plan. [...] Despite their failure as housing, the towers had left a long cultural legacy, of which [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] was the first and perhaps best-known exemplar; the link between the towers and the song was mentioned in some tourist books about Dublin. [...] Former towers residents were not always happy with the song. [...] Lynn Connolly, whose 2006 memoir The Mun: Growing Up in Ballymun detailed her raising there in the 1970s and 1980s, readily acknowledged the problems there and also wanted to get out at the time. [...] But she later came to realize that there had been much that was good at the towers – in terms of a collective wit among residents and a helping sense of community – which had been ignored by the media. [...] She thus wrote, [...] "regardless of what U2 say in their song, 'Running to Stand Still', there was certainly more than one way out." [...] In a newspaper interview, Connolly suggested that the song might have had a deleterious effect: [...] "It doesn't take a lot of imagination to picture an unemployed person, living alone in a flat in Ballymun, listening to that song and agreeing with what their hero was saying." [...] She further noted that some websites erroneously state that Bono grew up in Ballymun itself, and said, [...] "Perhaps it gave him a sort of street-cred to associate himself with the estate he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> his bedroom window in nice, safe, respectable Cedarwood Road in Glasnevin." ...|$|E

Bobby Hankinson of The Houston Chronicle characterized it as [...] "sort of terrible" [...] and [...] "unfunny", and IGN's Robert Canning gave it an [...] "okay" [...] grade of 6.5 out of 10, but Canning also acclaimed [...] "the introduction of Rachel's two dads played by Jeff Goldblum and Broadway vet Brian Stokes Mitchell"; he said they were [...] "fantastic" [...] and their schemes regarding the engagement [...] "delightful". Bell called theirs [...] "the most surprising pleasant performances of the night" [...] and added [...] "I absolutely adored these two". Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal summed up their appearance as [...] "annoyingly perfect", and TV Guide Kate Stanhope devoted an entire article to the pair, wrote, [...] "What's not to like? Seamless chemistry, witty back-and-forth", and noted that their appearance filled out Rachel's backstory. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was another who pointed out that you <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>from</b> their characterization, [...] "how Rachel got to be the way she was". Billboard Rae Votta approved of the episode as a whole and of the Berry parents: [...] "For a pair that have been noticeably absent from the show {{for two and a half}} seasons, they cram a ton of character moments into a single scene". VanDerWerff wrote that the scheme by the Berry fathers [...] "to get the two to break off their marriage plans by talking earnestly about teenage lovemaking" [...] was [...] "very, very creepy and just a little unsound, but I sort of like that it suggests to me that, yeah, this is who these guys are." [...] He characterized Hiram and LeRoy as [...] "goofy sitcom characters", unlike Burt or Carole.|$|E

2500|$|Five bells {{hang in the}} belfry {{above the}} clock. The four quarter bells strike the Westminster Chimes every quarter-hour. The largest bell strikes the hours; officially called The Great Bell of Westminster, it is {{generally}} referred to as Big Ben, a nickname of uncertain origins which, over time, has been colloquially applied to the whole tower. The first bell to bear this name cracked during testing and was recast; the present bell later developed a crack of its own, which gives it a distinctive sound. It is the third-heaviest bell in Britain, weighing 13.8 tonnes.

2500|$|Power {{spent his}} {{retirement}} in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico.

During the summers, he helped youngsters develop their baseball skills in both Puerto Rico and San Pedro de Macorís in the Dominican Republic. According to historian Bill James, Pellot was probably a main reason why San Pedro de Macorís became [...] "the world's richest source of baseball talent". According to Pellot, young people would most likely stay away from trouble and have a better opportunity to enter college on sports scholarships if they practiced sports. Pellot also coached, and among his pupils, either as a coach or as an educator of the sport were future Major League Baseball players Roberto Alomar, José Oquendo, Jerry Morales, Willie Montañez and José Cruz. Pellot died on November 29, 2005 in San Juan, Puerto Rico from cancer at the age of 78.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash read [...] “Send you men,” {{together}} with [...] “As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, {{so is the}} sluggard to them that send him.” The Midrash taught that God <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> the first that the spies were going to slander the land, as [...] says, “And they bend their tongue, their bow of falsehood.” The Midrash compared God’s words in [...] {{to the case of}} a rich man who had a vineyard.

Rav Kook wrote {{that he was not}} part of any party – he simply viewed himself as a follower of God and the laws of the Torah. His relationship with many different types of leaders and laymen, was a part of his general worldview – that all Jews must work together in serving God and bringing the redemption. Also, one <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> the published letters, that the [...] "Chareidi" [...] leadership was firm in its support of Rav Kook, and in fact had an apparent fond relationship with him. The vast majority of the [...] "Chareidi" [...] leaders publicized handwritten letters in support of Rav Kook, when a few individuals were publicly disrespectful towards him. Rav Kook embraced the support, but made clear that any insults were accepted by him without anger, for he viewed himself [...] "as a servant of G-d," [...] without interest in his personal honor.|$|E
2500|$|Sailing east {{they reached}} a 200-foot ice cliff which they called the Great Southern Barrier, now the Ross Ice Shelf, and {{followed}} it so reaching 78°4'S.

At a low point in the ice cliffs they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> the masthead [...] "an enormous plain of frosted silver" [...] and they were certain there was no open sea further south. After following the barrier for over 250 miles and with the Antarctic winter approaching {{they returned to the}} west but, near Mount Erebus, could not get ashore. They were 160 miles from the south magnetic pole – 700 miles nearer than anyone had been before. After passing Cape Adare, they again succeeded in breaking through the pack ice and reached Tasmania on 6 April 1841 to be greeted by John Franklin and crowds of well-wishers. As is happens Erebus and Terror were the last vessels to navigate the Ross Sea using only sail.|$|E
2500|$|Rav Judah said in Rav's {{name that}} ten things were created {{on the first}} day: (1) heaven, (2) earth, (3) chaos ( [...] , tohu), (4) desolation or void ( [...] , bohu), (5) light, (6) darkness, (7) wind, (8) water, (9) {{the length of a}} day, and (10) the length of a night. The Gemara cited verses to support Rav Judah's proposition: heaven and earth, as [...] says, [...] "In the {{beginning}} God created heaven and earth"; tohu and bohu, as [...] says, [...] "and the earth was tohu and bohu"; darkness, as [...] says, [...] "and darkness was upon the face of the deep; light, as [...] says, [...] "And God said, ‘Let there be light'"; wind and water, as [...] says, [...] "and the wind of God hovered over the face of the waters"; and the length of a day and the length of a night, as [...] says, [...] "And there was evening and there was morning, one day." [...] A Baraita taught that tohu (chaos) is a green line that encompasses the world, out of which darkness proceeds, as [...] says, [...] "He made darkness His hiding-place round about Him"; and bohu (desolation) means the slimy stones in the deep out of which the waters proceed, as [...] says, [...] "He shall stretch over it the line of confusion (tohu) and the plummet of emptiness (bohu)." [...] The Gemara questioned Rav Judah's assertion that light was created on the first day, as [...] reports that [...] "God made the two great lights [...] [...] [...] and God set them in the firmament of the heaven," [...] and [...] reports that God did so on the fourth day. The Gemara explained that the light of which Rav Judah taught was the light of which Rabbi Eleazar spoke when he said that by the light that God created on the first day, one <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> one end of the world to the other; but as soon as God saw the corrupt generations of the Flood and the Dispersion, God hid the light from them, as [...] says, [...] "But from the wicked their light is withheld." [...] Rather, God reserved the light of the first day for the righteous in the time to come, as [...] says, [...] "And God saw the light, that it was good." [...] The Gemara noted a dispute among the Tannaim over this interpretation. Rabbi Jacob agreed with the view that by the light that God created on the first day one <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> one end of the world to the other. But the Sages equated the light created on the first day with the lights of which [...] speaks, which God created on the first day, but placed in the heavens on the fourth day..|$|E
