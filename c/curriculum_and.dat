40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{relationship}} between <b>curriculum</b> proposal <b>and</b> <b>curriculum</b> practice in the Brazilian Educational System. The thesis argues {{that there is a}} wide gap between <b>curriculum</b> proposal <b>and</b> the <b>curriculum</b> practice in Brazilian education. This argument is approached from the perspective of mediation processes, which occur between these curriculum phenomena. The study covers the period 1970 - 1990. Following the Introduction, Chapter One, based on the review of relevant literature on <b>curriculum</b> proposal <b>and</b> <b>curriculum</b> practice, analyses the state of the Brazilian Primeiro Grau [First Level] School, as regulated by the Educational Law 5. 692, of 1971. Chapter Two examines some of the theories related to curriculum reforms, <b>curriculum</b> proposal <b>and</b> <b>curriculum</b> practice in order to provide a basis for the approach proposed for this study. Using the findings of Chapter One, this Chapter points to three arenas that are especially relevant for the relationship between <b>curriculum</b> proposal <b>and</b> <b>curriculum</b> practice. These arenas are: political support, bureaucratic structure and teacher training. In Chapter Three, fieldwork is carried out in Germany in order to refine the mediation concept and to look at how it operates in a country where one expects good education results. Chapter Four covers the fieldwork carried out in Brazil, more specifically in the State of Rio de Janeiro, in 1990. This research studies the mediation processes which occur in the relationship between <b>curriculum</b> proposal <b>and</b> <b>curriculum</b> practice in the three selected arenas. Finally, in the Conclusion, the major outcomes of this study, based on the evidence described in the previous chapters, are brought together. Understandings of the mediation processes, active in the three selected arenas in the relationship between <b>curriculum</b> proposal <b>and</b> <b>curriculum</b> practice in Brazil, are highlighted...|$|R
