5|$|In the Enchanted Forest, Hansel (Lord) and Gretel (Collins), {{are searching}} for {{kindling}} while their father (Lea) chops firewood. He gives Gretel a compass so they won't be separated, but when they return, he {{is nowhere to be}} found. As they search they run into The Evil Queen (Parrilla) and are captured. She tells the two that she can help find their father, on the condition that they retrieve an item belonging to her from The Blind Witch (Emma Caulfield). They must enter her gingerbread house when The Blind Witch is asleep and fetch The Evil Queen's leather satchel, but they must not eat a thing. They break in safely, but Hansel gives in to the temptation of taking a bite of a cupcake, causing The Blind Witch to wake up. While she cannot see the children, she <b>can</b> <b>smell</b> their scent. The Blind Witch locks them up and prepares the oven to roast them. The two, working together, are able to push the witch into her own oven as The Evil Queen, who is gleefully watching the events from her mirror, magically sends a bolt of fire through her mirror into the witch's oven, roasting her alive.|$|E

25|$|Both MWDs {{and their}} {{civilian}} counterparts provide service in drug detection, sniffing out {{a broad range}} of psychoactive substances despite efforts at concealment. Provided they have been trained to detect it, MWDs <b>can</b> <b>smell</b> small traces of nearly any substance, even if it is in a sealed container. Dogs trained in drug detection are normally used at ports of embarkation such as airports, checkpoints, and other places where there is high security and a need for anti-contraband measures.|$|E
25|$|Spices, called besamim in Hebrew, often {{stored in}} an artistically {{decorative}} spice container {{in order to}} beautify and honor the Mitzvah, are handed around so that everyone <b>can</b> <b>smell</b> the fragrance. In many Sephardi and Mizrahi communities, branches of aromatic plants are used for this purpose, while Ashkenazim have traditionally used cloves. A special braided Havdalah candle {{with more than one}} wick is lit, and a blessing is recited. If a special havdalah candle is not available, two candles can be used, and the two flames joined when reciting the blessing.|$|E
500|$|Whales are {{not thought}} {{to have a good}} sense of taste, as their taste buds are atrophied or missing altogether. [...] However, some toothed whales have {{preferences}} between different kinds of fish, indicating some sort of attachment to taste. The presence of the Jacobson's organ indicates that whales <b>can</b> <b>smell</b> food once inside their mouth, which might be similar to the sensation of taste.|$|E

500|$|Mrs. Tittlemouse {{called upon}} Potter's keen {{observation}} of insects, arachnids, and amphibians, and her youthful experience drawing them. [...] Their depictions in text and illustration reflect {{her understanding of}} insect anatomy, colouration, and behaviour; they are rendered with accuracy, humour, and true to their individual natures [...] she knew that toads only seek water during the spawning season, for example, and that they <b>can</b> <b>smell</b> honey.

Mrs. Tittlemouse fears she [...] "shall go distracted" [...] {{as a result of}} the turmoil and takes refuge in the nut-cellar. When she finally ventures forth, she discovers everybody has left but her house is a mess. She takes some moss, beeswax, and twigs to partly close up her front door to keep Mr. Jackson out. Exhausted, she goes to bed wondering if her house will ever be tidy again.|$|E

As he reaches {{the edge of the}} platform, Beckham dives into a vat of the fragrance. In the next scene he is fully dressed in one of his trademark tailored suits. Beckham appeared in a sketch on The Ellen DeGeneres Show to promote the fragrance. In the sketch he is [...] "almost unrecognisable" [...] as he stood in the cosmetics aisle at a Target store, offering passing customers a sample spray of the scent. Homme by David Beckham was included in Esquires list of the best colognes for men in 2011.

500|$|The {{people in}} the {{wardrobe}} are uncomfortable, not least because of John's odour. Geraldine passes around mints as Andrew tells Mark {{that he no longer}} has contact with Dicky Lawrence, a potential business contact of Mark's. Andrew sings the [...] "sardine song", but Carl angrily stops him. Andrew and Geraldine reminisce about a scout jamboree held in the house many years ago, but Geraldine remembers that a boy named Phillip Harrison, nicknamed [...] "Little Pip", said Andrew did [...] "terrible things", and that the police were involved. Carl says how Andrew paid Pip's family to move away, and Andrew counters by claiming he did nothing to Pip and was only teaching him how to wash himself. Carl implies that he and John were not as lucky as Pip, and John says he <b>can</b> <b>smell</b> carbolic soap. There is silence, and Stuart points out no one else is looking for them, but they realise Ian has not yet returned from the bathroom. Jeremy says Ian is the person he was going to pick up from the station, but when Mark claims Ian is already at the party, Jeremy reveals the person Mark is referring to is not Ian. Outside, [...] "Ian" [...] locks the wardrobe and sprays it with lighter fluid while singing the sardine song. Carl realises Ian is actually Phillip, and the episode ends with Phillip leaning against the wardrobe, a lighter in his hand.|$|E
500|$|The road meanders through forest {{lands and}} fields as it {{continues}} northwesterly toward the Log Slide. This location gives motorists {{a chance to}} hike down to the lakeshore to see the Au Sable Point Lighthouse peeking above the trees {{to the east and}} the Grand Sable Dunes to the west. The American Motorcyclist Association said of this segment of the roadway that it is [...] "so close to the beach and lake that [...] <b>can</b> <b>smell</b> it when [...] rides." [...] The lighthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and can be accessed from the Hurricane River Campground. The roadway crosses the Hurricane River and turns southerly away from Lake Superior. H-58 turns back eastward near Grand Sable Lake, running between the north shore of the lake and the Grand Sable Dunes on the south shore of Lake Superior. At the intersection with William Hill and Newburg roads, H-58 makes a 90° curve and travels northward for about three-quarters of a mile (1.2km). The road turns back eastward next to the Sable Falls parking lot. This lot also marks the eastern end of the segment of H-58 that road crews do not plow. The roadway exits the national park and runs to the community of Grand Marais. On the edge of town is the Woodland Township Park where hikers can walk along the beach {{to the base of the}} Grand Sable Dunes that form the east end of the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. These dunes reach heights of up to [...] at a 35° incline. Hikers are advised to use the access points along H-58 to get to the dunes instead of attempting the climb up the face.|$|E

500|$|On {{retirement}} as a player, O'Reilly {{became a}} cricket columnist for The Sydney Morning Herald, remaining {{in that position}} until his health declined in 1988. [...] His first engagement was England's tour of Australia in 1946–47, and during this season he began {{a partnership with the}} Daily Express of London, going on to cover several Ashes series for them. O'Reilly's articles for The Sydney Morning Herald were reproduced in its sister publication, The Age of Melbourne. Later, his writing was syndicated to newspapers in India, South Africa and New Zealand. His style was described by Wisden as [...] "muscular, very Australian... flavoured with wit and imagery ('You <b>can</b> <b>smell</b> the gum-leaves off him', he wrote of one country boy just starting with Queensland)." [...] Jack McHarg said that [...] "The clarity, wit and pungency of his writing, together with almost infallible judgment, never deserted him", even as his health began to restrict him. He was a highly respected and forthright pundit, who hated one-day cricket, describing it as [...] "hit and giggle". He condemned the omission of Keith Miller in 1949–50 and said that to call it [...] "a complete surprise would be a cowardly way of describing a botch". Reacting to the selection of the dour batting all rounder Ken Mackay, he wrote [...] "words fail...to express adequately my contempt for this howler". In 1952 he had a falling-out with Lindwall after condemning his protégé for bowling five consecutive bouncers at Everton Weekes in a Test. In comparison with his illustrious contemporary on-field and on paper, [...] "while Sir Donald walked the corridors of cricketing power O'Reilly was the rumbustious backbencher." [...] In 1956, O'Reilly strongly criticised Australian captain Ian Johnson, a Melburnian, for his leadership during the 1956 Ashes tour. The Age took exception to this and asked their sister publication to rein in their pundit. O'Reilly refused to shy away from his opinions and was dropped by the Melbourne publication. In the 1980s, when Bob Simpson became the first coach of Australia, O'Reilly, himself self-taught, spoke out against the creation of such posts. He was a strong critic of the breakaway World Series Cricket, the commercialisation of the sport and the erosion of the social norms that were followed during his playing career.|$|E

2500|$|Bears' {{sense of}} smell is {{dependent}} on a Jacobson's organ, or vomeronasal organ, which allows the bear to easily detect airborne scents.
