40|$|With current 2 -dimensional {{echocardiography}} (ECHO) and <b>colour-flow</b> <b>Doppler</b> it may {{no longer}} be necessary to perform preoperative angiocardiography (ANGlO) for patients with a primary diagnosis of uncomplicated unrestrictive ventricular septal defect (VSD). We compared the sensitivity and specificity of both techniques in the detection of additional VSD's and commonly associated lesions using as “gold standard” a combination of surgical findings plus postoperative ECHO's. A total of 130 consecutive patients undergoing VSD repair in infancy between January 1991 and March 1994 were studied. The mean age at repair was 0. 48 ± 0. 26 year and mean weight at repair was 5. 0 ± 1. 5 kg. All ECHO's were performed prior to ANGlO. Associated lesions included right ventricular muscle bundles (RVMB), sub-aortic stenosis (sub-AS), and persistent ductus arteriosus (PDA). No case of aortic valve prolapse causing aortic incompetence was identified, and aortic arch abnormalities were generally surgically addressed prior to ANGlO. The sensitivity and specificity of the two techniques in the detection of additional VSD's were:SensitivitySpecificityEcho 63 % 99 %Angio 63 % 95 %Out of a total of 8 cases with additional VSD's, 2 were small anterior muscular defects which were clinically insignificant, and only seen by <b>colour-flow</b> <b>Doppler.</b> The results for detection of associated lesions were:SensitivitySpecificityEchoAngioEchoAngioRVMB 73 % 73 % 93 % 96 %Sub-AS 63 % 38 % 96 % 97 %PDA 80 % 80 % 98 % 99 %Our results suggest that ECHO is comparable to ANGlO in the preoperative assessment of uncomplicated VSD in infancy.

40|$|Three {{patients}} with total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (TAPVD) were studied by real-time cross-sectional <b>colour-flow</b> <b>Doppler</b> echocardiography. Serial suprasternal, parasternal and subcostal scans were obtained. In all cases surgical or angiocardiographic confirmation was available. Two patients had supracardiac drainage (to the left vertical vein {{or to the}} right superior vena cava) and one patient had infracardiac drainage. An abnormal forward flow in the left innominate vein and vertical vein was visualized in those {{patients with}} supracardiac TAPVD. Abnormal venous flow was also imaged in one patient with mixed drainage. In the patient with infradiaphragmatic TAPVD characteristic flow signals were identified in the inferior vena cava (retrograde flow) and in the descending aorta and anomalous pulmonary venous channel (forward flow). In all patients the patterns of pulmonary venous flow allowed us to distinguish TAPVD from contiguous structures and to validate two-dimensional cross-sectional imaging...|$|E
40|$|Background: Amiodarone-induced {{thyrotoxicosis}} (AIT) {{is caused}} by excessive hormone synthesis and release (AIT I) or a destructive process (AIT II). This differentiation has important therapeutic implications. Purpose: To evaluate 99 mTc-sestaMIBI (MIBI) thyroid scintigraphy {{in addition to other}} diagnostic tools in the diagnosis and management of AIT. Subjects and methods: Thyroid 99 mTcOK 4 and 99 mTc-MIBI scintigraphies were performed in 20 consecutive AIT patients, along with a series of biochemical and instrumental investigations (measurement of thyrotrophin, free thyroid hormones and thyroid autoantibodies; thyroid <b>colour-flow</b> <b>Doppler</b> sonography (CFDS) and thyroid radioiodine uptake (RAIU). Results: On the basis of instrumental and laboratory data (excluding thyroid 99 mTc-MIBI scintigraphy) and follow-up, AIT patients could be subdivided into six with AIT I, ten with AIT II and four with indefinite forms of AIT (AIT Ind). 99 mTc-MIBI uptake results were normal/increased in all the six patients with AIT I and absent in all the ten patients with AIT II. The remaining four patients with AIT Ind showed low, patchy and persistent uptake in two cases and in the other two evident MIBI uptake followed by a rapid washout. MIBI scintigraphy was superior to all other diagnostic tools, including CFDS (suggestive of AIT I in three patients with AIT II and of AIT II in three with AIT Ind) and RAIU, which was measurable in all patients with AIT I, and also in four out of the ten with AIT II. Conclusion: Thyroid MIBI scintigraphy may be proposed as an easy and highly effective tool for the differential diagnosis of different forms of AIT...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThis {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to prospectively evaluate {{the impact of}} partial portal decompression on renal haemodynamics and renal function in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. MethodsFifteen consecutive patients (median age 49 years) with cirrhosis underwent partial portal decompression through portacaval shunting or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS). Cirrhosis was caused by alcohol in 47 %, hepatitis C in 13 %, both in 33 % and autoimmune factors in 7 % of patients. Child class was A in 13 %, B in 20 % and C in 67 % of patients. The median score on the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) was 14. 0 (mean 15. 0 ± 7. 7). Serum creatinine (SrCr) and creatinine clearance (CrCl) were determined pre-shunt, 5 days after shunting and 1 year after shunting. <b>Colour-flow</b> <b>Doppler</b> ultrasound of the renal arteries was also undertaken with calculation of the resistive index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI). Changes in the portal vein–inferior vena cava pressure gradient with shunting were determined. ResultsWith shunting, the portal vein–inferior vena cava gradients dropped significantly, with significant increases in PI in the early period after shunting. Creatinine clearance improved in the early post-shunt period. However, SrCr levels did not significantly improve. At 1 year after shunting, both CrCl and SrCr levels tended towards pre-shunt levels {{and the increase in}} PI did not persist. DiscussionPartial portal decompression improves mild to moderate renal dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis. Early improvements in renal function after shunting begin to disappear by 1 year after shunting...|$|E
40|$|<b>Colour-flow</b> <b>Doppler</b> {{sonography}} {{has been}} described as a means of assessing corpus luteum (CL) function rapidly, because area of luteal blood vessels correlates well with circulating progesterone (P 4) concentrations [P 4] in oestrous cycling mares. The aim of this study was to assess the relationships between CL size and vascularity, and circulating [P 4] during early pregnancy in mares, and to determine whether luteal blood flow was a useful aid for selecting an embryo transfer recipient. Equine embryos (n = 48) were recovered 8 days after ovulation and were transferred to available recipient mares as part of a commercial program with the degree of synchrony in timing of recipient ovulation ranging from 1 day before to 4 days after the donor. Immediately prior to embryo transfer (ET), maximum CL cross-section and blood vessel areas were assessed sonographically, and jugular blood was collected to measure plasma [P 4]. Sonographic measurements and jugular blood collection were repeated at day 4 after ET for all mares, and again at days 11, 18 and 25 after ET in mares that were pregnant. The number of grey-scale and colour pixels within the CL was subsequently quantified using ImageJ software. The CL blood flow correlated significantly but weakly with plasma [P 4] on the day of transfer and on day 4 after ET in all mares, and on days 11 and 25 after ET in pregnant mares (r = 0. 30 - 0. 36). The CL area and plasma [P 4] were also correlated on each day until day 11 after ET (r = 0. 49 - 0. 60). The CL colour pixel area decreased significantly after day 18, whereas CL area was already decreasing by day 4 after ET. The CL area, area of blood flow, or [P 4] was predictive of pregnancy. Findings in the present study suggest that both CL area and blood flow are correlated with circulating [P 4] at the time of transfer and in early pregnancy. Evaluation of the CL using B-mode or CF sonography, although practical, provides no improvement in the selection of recipients or prediction of pregnancy outcomes than methods employed currently...|$|E
40|$|Amiodarone (AM), {{a potent}} class III {{anti-arrhythmic}} drug, is an iodine-rich compound with a structural resemblance to thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T 3) and thyroxine (T 4). At the commonly employed doses, AM causes iodine overload up to 50 - 100 times the optimal daily intake, {{which may be}} responsible of a spectrum of effects on thyroid function often counterbalancing its heart benefits. Although most patients on chronic AM treatment remain euthyroid, a consistent proportion may develop thyrotoxicosis (AM-induced thyrotoxicosis, AIT) or hypothyroidism. AIT is more prevalent in iodine-deficient areas and is currently subdivided in two different clinico-pathological forms (AIT I and AIT II). AIT I develops in subjects with underlying thyroid disease, and is caused by an exacerbation by iodine load of thyroid autonomous function; AIT II occurs in patients with no underlying thyroid disease and is probably consequent to a drug-induced destructive thyroiditis. Mixed or indeterminate forms of AIT encompassing several features of both AIT I and AIT II may be also observed. The differential diagnosis between AIT I and AIT II (which {{is important for the}} choice of the appropriate therapy) is currently made on radioiodine uptake (RAIU), which may be high, normal or low but detectable in AIT I, while is consistently very low or undetectable in AIT II and on <b>colour-flow</b> <b>Doppler</b> sonography (CFDS) showing normal or increased vascularity in AIT I and absent vascularity in AIT II. Quite recently, studies carried out in our Units at the University of Cagliari (Italy) showed that sestaMIBI thyroid scintigraphy may represent the best single test to differentiate AIT I (showing increased MIBI retention) from AIT II (displaying no significant uptake). Treatment of AIT is dependent from its etiology. AIT usually responds to combined thionamides and potassium perchlorate (KClO 4) therapy, AIT II generally responds to glucocorticoids, while indeterminate forms may require both therapeutic approaches. In patients with AIT I definitive treatment of hyperthyroidism by administration of (131) I, initially not feasible for the low RAIU and/or the risk of thyrotoxicosis exacerbation, is advised after normalization of iodine overload. To control severe AIT additional treatment with lithium carbonate, the use of short course of iopanoic acid and plasmapheresis have been also proposed. In cases resistant to medical treatment and/or in patients with severe cardiac diseases who cannot interrupt AM or require quick AM reintroduction, total thyroidectomy (possibly carried out by minimally invasive video-assisted technique) may be proposed after rapid correction of thyrotoxicosis with combination of thionamides, KClO 4, corticosteroids and a short course of iopanoic acid. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} how North American thyroidologists assess and treat amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) and {{to compare the}} results {{with those of the}} same questionnaire-based survey previously carried out among European thyroidologists. DESIGN: Members of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) with clinical interests were sent by e-mail a questionnaire on the diagnosis and management of AIT, 115 responses were received from the United States and Canada, representing about one-third of ATA members with clinical interests. RESULTS: The majority of respondents (91 %vs. 68 % in Europe, P < 0. 05) see < 10 new cases of AIT per year, and AIT seems less frequent than amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism (AIH) in North America (34 % and 66 % of amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction, respectively, vs. 75 % and 25 %, respectively, in Europe, P < 0. 001). When AIT is suspected, in North America hormonal assessment is mostly based on serum free T 4 (FT 4) and TSH measurements, while serum free T 3 (FT 3) determination is requested less frequently than in Europe; thyroid autoimmunity is included in the initial assessment less than in Europe. Most commonly used additional diagnostic procedures include, as in Europe, thyroid <b>colour-flow</b> <b>Doppler</b> sonography, and to a lesser extent, thyroid radioactive iodine uptake and scan, but Europeans tend to request multiple tests more than North Americans. Withdrawal of amiodarone is more often considered unnecessary by North American thyroidologists (21 %vs. 10 % in Europe in type 1 AIT, P < 0. 05, 34 %vs. 20 % in type 2 AIT, P < 0. 05). In type 1 AIT thionamides represent the treatment of choice for North Americans as well as for Europeans, but the former use them as monotherapy in 65 %vs. 51 % of Europeans (P < 0. 05) who more often consider potassium perchlorate as an useful addition (31 %vs. 15 % of North Americans, P < 0. 01). Glucocorticoids are the selected treatment for type 2 AIT, alone (62 %vs. 46 % in Europe, P < 0. 05) or in association with thionamides (16 %vs. 25 % in Europe, P = NS). After restoration of euthyroidism, thyroid ablation in the absence of recurrent thyrotoxicosis is recommended in type 1 AIT less frequently by North Americans. If amiodarone therapy needs to be reinstituted, prophylactic thyroid ablation is advised by 76 % in type 1 AIT, while a 'wait-and-see' strategy is adopted by 61 % in type 2 AIT, similar to behaviour of European thyroidologists. CONCLUSION: Similarities and differences exist between expert North American and European thyroidologists concerning the diagnosis and management of AIT. While differences reflect the frequent uncertainty of the underlying mechanism leading to AIT, similarities may represent the basis to refine the diagnostic criteria and to improve the therapeutic outcomes of this challenging clinical situatio...|$|E
