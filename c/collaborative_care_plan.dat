40|$|Background: An {{enhanced}} {{primary care}} approach to managing patients with complex and chronic conditions has highlighted {{the need for}} interprofessional practice in general practice. Thus, increased knowledge of discipline contribution to care was needed. Interprofessional learning (IPL) is one method of achieving this objective. Aim: The project aimed to evaluate student learning experiences through interprofessional education (IPE) workshops utilising complex community-based clinical cases. Methods: Pre-registration students (n= 375) from medicine, nursing, pharmacy, speech pathology and physiotherapy participated in 3 -hour IPE workshops between 2006 and 2008. Small interprofessional groups worked to develop an integrated, <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> <b>plan</b> for community-based patients with chronic disease. Students completed a questionnaire consisting of a pre- and post-workshop self-report evaluation of their knowledge regarding interprofessional care specific to the complex case, rating of their beliefs on IPL based on the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS). Results: For each professional cohort, knowledge of interprofessional care improved (...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: To improve {{adherence}} to evidence-based recommendations, it is logical to identify determinants {{of practice and}} tailor interventions to address these. We have previously prioritised six recommendations to improve treatment of elderly patients with depression, and identified determinants of {{adherence to}} these recommendations. The aim {{of this article is}} to describe how we tailored interventions to address the determinants for the implementation of the recommendations. METHODS: We drafted an intervention plan, based on the determinants we had identified in a previous study. We conducted six group interviews with representatives of health professionals (GPs and nurses), implementation researchers, quality improvement officers, professional and voluntary organisations and relatives of elderly patients with depression. We informed about the gap between evidence and practice for elderly patients with depression and presented the prioritised determinants that applied to each recommendation. Participants brainstormed individually and then in groups, suggesting interventions to address the determinants. We then presented evidence on the effectiveness of strategies for implementing depression guidelines. We asked the groups to prioritise the suggested interventions considering the perceived impact of determinants and of interventions, the research evidence underlying the interventions, feasibility and cost. We audiotaped and transcribed the interviews and applied a five step framework for our analysis. We created a logic model with links between the determinants, the interventions, and the targeted improvements in adherence. RESULTS: Six groups with 29 individuals provided 379 suggestions for interventions. Most suggestions could be fit within the drafted plan, but the groups provided important amendments or additions. We sorted the interventions into six categories: resources for municipalities to develop a <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> <b>plan,</b> resources for health professionals, resources for patients and their relatives, outreach visits, educational and web-based tools. Some interventions addressed one determinant, while other interventions addressed several determinants. CONCLUSIONS: It was feasible and helpful to use group interviews and combine open and structured approaches to identify interventions that addressed prioritised determinants to adherence to the recommendations. This approach generated a large number of suggested interventions. We had to prioritise to tailor the interventions strategies...|$|E
40|$|This review {{presents}} a realist synthesis of “what works and why” in intermediate care {{for people who}} are homeless. The overall aim was to update an earlier synthesis of intermediate care by capturing new evidence from a recent UK government funding initiative (the “Homeless Hospital Discharge Fund”). The initiative made resources available to the charitable sector to enable partnership working with the National Health Service (NHS) in order to improve hospital discharge arrangements {{for people who are}} homeless. The synthesis adopted the RAMESES guidelines and reporting standards. Electronic searches were carried out for peer-reviewed articles published in English from 2000 to 2016. Local evaluations and the grey literature were also included. The inclusion criteria was that articles and reports should describe “interventions” that encompassed most of the key characteristics of intermediate care as previously defined in the academic literature. Searches yielded 47 articles and reports. Most of these originated in the UK or the USA and fell within the realist quality rating of “thick description”. The synthesis involved using this new evidence to interrogate the utility of earlier programme theories. Overall, the results confirmed the importance of (i) <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> <b>planning,</b> (ii) reablement and (iii) integrated working as key to effective intermediate care delivery. However, the additional evidence drawn from the field of homelessness highlighted the potential for some theory refinements. First, that “psychologically informed” approaches to relationship building may be necessary to ensure that service users are meaningfully engaged in <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> and second, that integrated working could be managed differently so that people are not “handed over” at {{the point at which the}} intermediate care episode ends. This was theorised as key to ensuring that ongoing care arrangements do not break down and that gains are not lost to the person or the system vis-à-vis the prevention of readmission to hospital...|$|R

Aims This study aimed to test the feasibility and utility of combining a generic, clinician administered and peer-led self-management group approach for people with serious mental illness. Method General practitioners and mental health case managers used a patient-centered care model (the Flinders Model) to assist 38 patients with serious mental illness to identify their self-management needs, and match these with interventions including Stanford peer-led, self-management groups and one-to-one peer support. Self-management and quality of life outcomes were measured and qualitative evaluation elicited feedback from all participants. Results <b>Collaborative</b> <b>care</b> <b>planning,</b> combined with a problems and goals focused approach, resulted in improved self-management and mental functioning at 3 to 6 months follow up. The Stanford self-management course was applicable and acceptable to patients with serious mental illnesses. Qualitative feedback was highly supportive of this approach. Conclusions Generic, structured assessment and <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> approaches, resulting in self-management education targeted to the individual, improved self-management and quality of life. Patients and service providers reported considerable gains despite the challenges associated with introducing a generic model within the mental health and general practice sector...|$|R

Background Ageing population trends create a strong imperative for healthcare systems to develop models of care that reduce dependence on hospital services. People living in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) currently have high rates of presentation to emergency departments.

40|$|Providers are {{encouraged}} to view patients with chronic disease as &# 145;partners&# 146; in their care, and to collaborate with them in developing <b>care</b> <b>plans.</b> Yet there is little guidance in how collaboration should occur, and little evidence that <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> improves patient outcomes. Related models and measures of patient centred care and shared decision making have not been developed specifically for the context of chronic disease care. This thesis aimed to develop a theoretical understanding of how providers and patients make decisions in chronic disease <b>care</b> <b>planning,</b> how patients experience involvement in <b>care</b> <b>planning,</b> {{and to develop a}} measure of patient involvement. It consists of two studies: a qualitative study to develop a grounded theory of decision-making in diabetes <b>care</b> <b>planning,</b> and a scale development and psychometrics study. The qualitative study involved 29 providers and 16 patients with diabetes. It found that providers were concerned with a process described as &# 145;managing patient involvement to do the right thing&# 146;, while patients were concerned with &# 145;being involved to make sure care is appropriate&# 146;. This led to the theory of &# 145;delivering respectful care&# 146;, a grounded theory that integrates provider and patient perspectives by showing how providers and patients can resolve their concerns while achieving mutually acceptable outcomes. Central to this theory is the process of finding common ground, while the key conditions are provider responsiveness and an ongoing, trusting and respectful provider-patient relationship. The <b>Collaborative</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Planning</b> Scale (CCPS), based on these findings, is a patient self-report scale that measures patients&# 146; perceptions of involvement in <b>care</b> <b>planning.</b> After piloting the CCPS was tested amongst 166 patients with diabetes. Exploratory factor analysis resulted in a 27 -item scale comprising two factors: &# 145;receiving appropriately personalised care&# 146; and &# 145;feeling actively involved in decision-making&# 146;. Psychometrics tests revealed the CCPS has adequate internal consistency and test-retest reliability, and findings support construct validity. &# 145;Delivering respectful care&# 146; enriches {{understanding of the nature of}} collaboration in chronic disease care, and identifies those elements necessary to ensure patients receive best possible care. The CCPS provides the means for measuring what patients say they value, and is thus an important measure of quality chronic disease care...|$|R
40|$|Background: The <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> study (COCAPP) is a cross-national {{comparative}} study of <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> and coordination in community mental healthcare settings. The context and delivery of mental health care is diverging between the countries of England and Wales whilst retaining points of common interest, hence providing a rich geographical comparison for research. Across England the key vehicle {{for the provision of}} recovery-focused, personalised, <b>collaborative</b> mental health <b>care</b> is the care programme approach (CPA). The CPA is a form of case management introduced in England in 1991, then revised in 2008. In Wales the CPA was introduced in 2003 but has now been superseded by The Mental Health (Care Co-ordination and <b>Care</b> and Treatment <b>Planning)</b> (CTP) Regulations (Mental Health Measure), a new statutory framework. In both countries, the CPA/CTP requires providers to: comprehensively assess health/social care needs and risks; develop a written <b>care</b> <b>plan</b> (which may incorporate risk assessments, crisis and contingency plans, advanced directives, relapse prevention plans, etc.) in collaboration with the service user and carer(s); allocate a care coordinator; and regularly review care. The overarching aim {{of this study is to}} identify and describe the factors that ensure CPA/CTP <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> and coordination is personalised, recovery-focused and conducted collaboratively. Methods/design: COCAPP will employ a concurrent transformative mixed methods approach with embedded case studies. Phase 1 (Macro-level) will consider the national context through a meta-narrative mapping (MNM) review of national policies and the relevant research literature. Phase 2 (Meso-level and Micro-level) will include in-depth micro-level case studies of everyday ‘frontline’ practice and experience with detailed qualitative data from interviews and reviews of individual <b>care</b> <b>plans.</b> This will be nested within larger meso-level survey datasets, senior-level interviews and policy reviews in order to provide potential explanations and understanding. Discussion: COCAPP will help identify the key components that support and hinder the provision of personalised, recovery-focused <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> and provide an informed rationale for a future planned intervention and evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{the implementation of}} recovery-based practice into a psychiatric intensive care unit, and report change in seclusion rates over the period when these changes were introduced (2011 – 2013). Method: Recovery-based practices including <b>collaborative</b> <b>care,</b> safety <b>care</b> <b>plans,</b> a comfort room, and debriefing after coercive interventions were introduced. A carer consultant was employed. A restraint and seclusion review committee, chaired by a peer worker, was established. A consumer exit interview was introduced and these data were collected, reviewed by staff and the peer worker and used to improve the ward environment. Rates of seclusion were measured during the period when recovery-based practices were introduced. Results: Consumer feedback indicated that positive aspects of the psychiatric intensive care unit included approachable, helpful staff and completion of a safety <b>care</b> <b>plan.</b> Negative aspects included lack of involvement in decisions about admission and about medications, the non-smoking policy, and being placed in seclusion or restraint. There was {{a significant reduction in}} the number of consumers secluded and the total number of seclusions. Conclusions: Recovery principles can be successfully introduced in a psychiatric intensive care unit environment. Introduction of recovery based practice was associated with a reduction in seclusion.

Objective Governments and the medical profession are concerned that there continues to be less than optimal health outcomes despite escalating expenditure on health services from the effect of the ageing population with chronic illnesses. In this context, doctors will need to have knowledge and skills in effective Chronic Condition Management (CCM) and Chronic Condition Self-Management (CCSM). Method A national workshop of representatives of eight medical schools from the CCSM Special Interest Group (SIG) of the Australian and New Zealand Association on Medical Education (ANZAME) met in September 2004, to consider curriculum content in CCM and CCSM.

40|$|Background and context. Currently, in New Zealand general practice, the {{introduction}} of new initiatives is such that interventions may be introduced without an evidence base. A critical role is to respond to the challenges of chronic illness with self-management a key component. The ‘Flinders Model’ of self-management <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> developed in Australia has not been evaluated in New Zealand. A study was designed to assess the usefulness of this ‘Model’ when utilised by nurses in New Zealand general practice. This paper describes the issues and lessons learnt from this study designed to contribute to the evidence base for primary care. Assessment of problems. Analysis of interviews with the nurses and the research team allowed documentation of difficulties. These included recruitment of practices and of patients, retention of patients and practice support for {{the introduction}} of the ‘new’ intervention. Results of assessment. A lack of organisational capacity for introduction of the ‘new’ initiative alongside practice difficulties in understanding their patient population and inadequate disease coding contributed to problems. Undertaking a research study designed to contribute to the evidence base for an initiative not established in general practice resulted in study difficulties. Lessons learnt. The need for phased approaches to evaluation of complex interventions in primary care is imperative with exploratory qualitative work first undertaken to understand barriers to implementation. Collaborative partnerships between researchers and general practice staff are essential if the evidence base for primary care is to develop and for ‘new’ interventions to lead to improved health outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} a provider initiated primary care outreach intervention compared with usual care among older adults at risk of functional decline. Design: Randomised controlled trial. Setting: Patients enrolled with 35 family physicians in five primary care networks in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Participants: Patients were eligible if they were 75 years of age or older and were not receiving home care services. Of 3166 potentially eligible patients, 2662 (84 %) completed the validated postal questionnaire used to determine risk of functional decline. Of 1724 patients who met the risk criteria, 769 (45 %) agreed to participate and 719 were randomised. Intervention: The 12 month intervention, provided by experienced home care nurses in 2004 - 6, consisted of a comprehensive initial assessment using the resident assessment instrument for home care; <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> with patients, their families, and family physicians; health promotion; and referral to community health and social support services. Main outcome measures: Quality adjusted life years (QALYs), use and costs of health and social services, functional status, self rated health, and mortality. Results: The mean difference in QALYs between intervention and control patients during the study period was not statistically significant (0. 017, 95 % confidence interval ? 0. 022 to 0. 056; P= 0. 388). The mean difference in overall cost of prescription drugs and services between the intervention and control groups was not statistically significant, (-$C 165 (£ 107;  118; $ 162), 95 % confidence interval -$C 16 545 to $$ 16 214; P= 0. 984). Changes over 12 months in functional status and self rated health were not significantly different between the intervention and control groups. Ten patients died in each group.

40|$|Background: Concerns about {{fragmented}} {{community mental}} health care {{have led to the}} development of the care programme approach in England and <b>care</b> and treatment <b>planning</b> in Wales. These systems require those people receiving mental health services to have a care co-ordinator, a written <b>care</b> <b>plan</b> and regular reviews of their <b>care.</b> <b>Care</b> <b>planning</b> and co-ordination should be recovery-focused and personalised, with people taking more control over their own support and treatment. Objective(s) : We aimed to obtain the views and experiences of various stakeholders involved in {{community mental health}} care; to identify factors that facilitated, or acted as barriers to, personalised, <b>collaborative</b> and recovery-focused <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> and co-ordination; and to make suggestions for future research. Design: A cross-national comparative mixed-methods study involving six NHS sites in England and Wales, including a meta-narrative synthesis of relevant policies and literature; a survey of recovery, empowerment and therapeutic relationships in service users (n = 449) and recovery in care co-ordinators (n = 201); embedded case studies involving interviews with service providers, service users and carers (n = 117); and a review of <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> (n = 33). Review methods: A meta-narrative mapping method. Results: Quantitative and qualitative data were analysed within and across sites using inferential statistics, correlations and the framework method. Our study found significant differences for scores on therapeutic relationships related to positive collaboration and clinician input. We also found significant differences between sites on recovery scores for care co-ordinators related to diversity of treatment options and life goals. This suggests that perceptions relating to how recovery-focused <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> works in practice are variable across sites. Interviews found great variance in the experiences of <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> and the understanding of recovery and personalisation within and across sites, with some differences between England and Wales. <b>Care</b> <b>plans</b> were seen as largely irrelevant by service users, who rarely consulted them. Care co-ordinators saw them as both useful records and also an inflexible administrative burden that restricted time with service users. Service users valued their relationships with care co-ordinators and saw this as being central to their recovery. Carers reported varying levels of involvement in <b>care</b> <b>planning.</b> Risk was a significant concern for workers, but this appeared to be rarely discussed with service users, who were often unaware of the content of risk assessments.

There is an increasing expectation that health providers engage patients as active participants in their own self-management. This engagement is crucial to the chronic care model as patients with COPD and their families manage the majority of the care in the community. Understanding what influences empowerment will help health care professionals to better engage in <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> and decision making that meet the needs of this new generation of health consumers. Aim: The aim {{of the present study was}} to identify interventions or approaches that empower patients in the management of COPD. Methods: An integrative review was undertaken following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses approach. Papers were included if they 1) provided a definition or conceptualization of empowerment, and 2) reported interventions or approaches fostering empowerment in patients with COPD. Thematic analysis was used to develop conceptual themes on patient empowerment in COPD. These conceptual themes were validated by a panel of specialists in COPD, chronic disease management, self-management, and patient education. Results: Literature searching revealed 183 papers of which 15 studies conceptualized or defined empowerment interventions or approaches to support COPD management. These were grouped into the following five categories: pulmonary rehabilitation, social support, web-based interventions, approaches that support knowledge development, and the approach taken by the health care professional. Conclusion: Pulmonary rehabilitation, knowledge acquisition, social support, telehealth and web-based interfaces, and collaboration with health care professionals empower patients to recognize their own strengths and to manage the impact of the condition. Patients&# 39; abilities to direct their own care are additionally influenced by physical debilitation, treatment complexity, economic status, and health literacy.

To assess the cost-effectiveness of <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> in a UK primary care setting. An economic evaluation alongside a multi-centre cluster randomised controlled trial comparing <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> with usual primary care for adults with depression (n = 581). Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated over a 12 -month follow-up, {{from the perspective of the}} UK National Health Service and Personal Social Services (i. e.

The <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> intervention had a mean cost of £ 272. 50 per participant. Health and social care service use, excluding <b>collaborative</b> <b>care,</b> indicated a similar profile of resource use between <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> and usual <b>care</b> participants. <b>Collaborative</b> <b>care</b> offered a mean incremental gain of 0. 02 (95 % CI: - 0. 02, 0. 06) quality-adjusted life-years over 12 months, at a mean incremental cost of £ 270. 72 (95 % CI: - 202. 98, 886. 04), and resulted in an estimated mean cost per QALY of £ 14, 248. Where costs associated with informal care are considered in sensitivity analyses <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> is expected to be less costly and more effective, thereby dominating treatment as usual. <b>Collaborative</b> <b>care</b> offers health gains at a relatively low cost, and is cost-effective compared with usual care against a decision-maker willingness to pay threshold of £ 20, 000 per QALY gained.

A grounded theory approach with open coding and the constant comparative method revealed categories where emergent themes were saturated and validated through member checking, and a conceptual model was developed. Results: Three major themes emerged from the data including the importance of working as a <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> team, the strengths of <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> for treating bipolar disorder, {{and the need for}} psychiatric consultants to adapt specialty psychiatric clinical skills to the primary care setting. Other discussion topics included gathering clinical data from multiple sources over time, balancing risks and benefits of treating patients indirectly, tracking patient care outcomes with a registry, and patient-centered care. Conclusion: Experienced psychiatric consultants working in <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> teams provided their perceptions regarding treating patients with bipolar illness including identifying ways to adapt specialty psychiatric skills, developing techniques for providing team-based care, and perceiving the <b>care</b> delivered through <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> as high quality...|$|R
40|$|Objectives Major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD) {{is associated}} with absenteeism. In this study, the effectiveness of <b>collaborative</b> <b>care,</b> {{with a focus on}} return to work (RTW), was evaluated in its effect on depressive symptoms and the duration until RTW in sick-listed workers with MDD in the occupational health setting. Methods In this randomised controlled trial, 126 sick-listed workers with MDD were randomised to usual care (N= 61) or <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> (N= 65). <b>Collaborative</b> <b>care</b> was applied by the occupational physician care manager, supported by a web-based tracking system and a consultant psychiatrist. Primary outcome measure was time to response. Secondary outcome measures were time to remission, depressive symptoms as continuous measure and the duration until full RTW. Results <b>Collaborative</b> <b>care</b> participants had a shorter time to response, with a difference of 2. 8  months. However, no difference was found on time to remission or depressive symptoms as continuous measure. With a mean of 190  days in the <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> group, and 210  days in the usual care group, the groups did not differ significantly from each other in the duration until full RTW. Adherence to the <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> intervention was low. Conclusions These results do not justify a widespread implementation of <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> in occupational healthcare, as it was operationalised in this study. However, since the study might have been underpowered for RTW and because treatment integrity was low, further research, with larger sample sizes, is needed to develop the best fitting (<b>collaborative</b> <b>care)</b> model for addressing RTW in depressed sick-listed workers...|$|R

40|$|Routine needs {{assessments}} {{have become}} mandated requirements for public mental health services. However, {{the appropriateness of}} these generic health needs assessments to specialist populations remains questionable. This study sought to assess individual needs assessed using a widely used clinician rated assessment (Health of the Nation Outcome Scales-Secure; HoNOS-Secure), a subjective needs assessment that considers both staff and patient perspectives (Camberwell Assessment of Need-Forensic version; CANFOR), and a measure of risk for general criminal recidivism (Level of Service Inventory: Screening Version; LSI:SV) in a secure forensic mental health service. Results revealed significant positive correlations between staff ratings on HoNOS-Secure, CANFOR total needs, and CANFOR met needs scores, but no significant association between CANFOR ratings or HoNOS-Secure ratings and LSI:SV scores. Although patients and staff reported {{the same number of}} needs overall according to CANFOR (7. 2 vs. 7. 5, P > 0. 05), patients reported that more of these needs were unmet (3. 1 vs. 2. 3, P < 0. 05). Differences between staff and patient ratings of need suggest that needs assessments should include patient perspectives to facilitate more <b>collaborative</b> and comprehensive <b>care</b> <b>planning.</b> Divergent perspectives between patients and staff may impair patient engagement in treatment and therefore negatively impact on outcome. Service planning issues and opportunities for future research are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In {{patient care}} today, teams of {{practitioners}} from various disciplines must coordinate their efforts {{in order to}} deliver care successfully. Frontline nurses and physicians must interact with social workers, therapists, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and others to develop and carry out coordinated <b>plans</b> of <b>care.</b> Also, clinical team members must communicate with {{patients and their families}} in language that can be understood and acted upon.

40|$|Purpose of Review: The {{purpose of}} this study is to review recent {{evidence}} of the effects of enhanced depression care, focusing (1) on symptomatic, functional and economic outcomes and (2) across different countries, (3) ethnic groups and (4) settings. Recent Findings: <b>Collaborative</b> <b>care</b> is currently by far the most influential and best studied method to enhance depression care. Recent trials and reviews provide firm evidence that <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> is more effective than care as usual (CAU), though with small effects. These effects generalized across several important health outcomes are probably more pronounced in patients with more complex or severe disorders. Cost-effectiveness and cost utility data demonstrate that <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> is of good value for money, and this is probably more pronounced in patients with higher a-priori levels of healthcare utilization. <b>Collaborative</b> <b>care</b> is readily exported to other healthcare systems, other regions of the world and other cultures. Summary: Given parallel development and successful testing of other cheaper and more simple interventions targeting depression (such as guided self-help and e-mental health), it may be that <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> will focus on the more severe, complex or recurrent forms of affective disorder in the future. Including effects of <b>collaborative</b> <b>care</b> on other outcomes, especially on work-related functioning and economic productivity, seems fruitful. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|R
