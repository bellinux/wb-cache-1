40|$|The {{enrichment}} of alkali in {{the blast}} furnace has been {{proven to be a}} catalyst of coke gasification and is thus a key parameter in the degradation of coke. Alkali also directly destroys the carbon structure, increases the risk of scaffold formation, increases the load and attacks the refractory. It is thus important to decrease the recirculation of alkali {{in the blast}} furnace and the gasification of coke to ensure sufficient strength of the coke. The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine possible ways of alkali control in the blast furnace. This was done by investigating if coke with a modified ash composition contributed to a higher capacity of binding alkali in stable phases, which can be drained via the slag. This would decrease the recirculation of alkali in the blast furnace and prohibit coke degradation. Two campaigns were studied to determine the distribution of alkali in the shaft when the charging differed, this to improve the understanding of alkali control in the blast furnace with respect to the charging practice. Three different test cokes were produced in pilot scale with a mineral addition of kaolin, silica or bauxite. The test cokes were together with base coke used as a reference, <b>charged</b> in <b>baskets</b> to LKAB’s Experimental Blast Furnace (EBF) at the end of a campaign. When the campaign was finished the EBF was quenched with nitrogen and the <b>charged</b> <b>baskets</b> were excavated. The influence of alkali on coke with a modified ash composition was examined with XRF, XRD, SEM-EDS and TGA. This was done in order to confirm any difference between the test cokes and the base coke in terms of chemical composition, phases in the coke ash, degree of graphitisation and reactivity. The results showed that the base coke in most cases had collected more alkali compared to the test coke with a mineral addition of kaolin and silica. For the test coke with addition of bauxite the alkali content was higher in three out of four samples compared with the corresponding base coke. Unreacted grains with bauxite were detected, which indicates that bauxite was completely or partly inactive in the capturing of alkali. All aluminosilicates detected in the coke samples contained alkali, which indicates that aluminosilicates contributes in the capturing of alkali in the EBF. The main mineral phases containing potassium in the coke were kalsilite, leucite and other aluminosilicates with varying alkali content. The carbon conversion and thus the reactivity increased with the alkali content in both the test coke and the base coke. The reactivity of the test coke was thus not decreased due to the mineral addition. No indications of an increased capacity of capturing alkali in stable phases could be seen in the test cokes, this could be due to the low amount of minerals added. The uptake of alkali in the different coke types was dependent of the horizontal and vertical position in the EBF, and thus the conditions the baskets had been exposed to and the distribution of alkali within the EBF. It was concluded that the charging had an impact on the alkali distribution in the EBF. During campaign 31 the alkali content was more evenly distributed over the horizontal section in the upper part of the furnace, in the lower shaft the alkali content increased towards the centre. During campaign 32 the alkali content was increasing towards the walls in shaft of the EBF. The content of alkali in the lower shaft was higher during campaign 32 compared with campaign 31...|$|R

Signs of degradation were apparent throughout the coke pieces that have undergone CSR/CRI testing, but were less observable in coke reacted in the blast furnace. The results indicate that reaction with CO 2 is generally limited by the chemical reaction rate in the CSR/CRI test, while in the blast furnace the reaction is limited by the diffusion rate.

50|$|The scrap basket is {{then taken}} to the melt shop, the roof is swung off the furnace, and the furnace is charged with scrap from the <b>basket.</b> <b>Charging</b> {{is one of the}} more {{dangerous}} operations for the EAF operators. A lot of potential energy is released by the tonnes of falling metal; any liquid metal in the furnace is often displaced upwards and outwards by the solid scrap, and the grease and dust on the scrap is ignited if the furnace is hot, resulting in a fireball erupting. In some twin-shell furnaces, the scrap is charged into the second shell while the first is being melted down, and pre-heated with off-gas from the active shell. Other operations are continuous charging—pre-heating scrap on a conveyor belt, which then discharges the scrap into the furnace proper, or charging the scrap from a shaft set above the furnace, with off-gases directed through the shaft. Other furnaces can be charged with hot (molten) metal from other operations.|$|R
30|$|Basket heating {{apparatus}} {{consists of a}} container (basket) shaped as a cube, a cylinder or a sphere, made of wire mesh to hold the sample, an oven to maintain the temperature and a thermocouple to measure the temperature inside the sample. Measuring the runaway temperature involves the following steps: <b>charging</b> the <b>basket</b> with a sample, inserting the thermocouple {{in the middle of}} the basket, then placing this basket inside a preheated oven and finally recording the temperature with a data logger (Wang et al. 2006). The objective of this method is to determine the critical oven temperature that gives rise to self-heating. This approach assumes a single Arrhenius reaction rate, constant and isotropic material properties, and no water evaporation (Wang et al. 2006; Drysdale 1985). The measurements are normally analysed using the Frank-Kamenetskii theory as explained later in this review. Bowes et al. implemented this method to measure the self-heating and ignition temperature of sawdust for different concentrations of oxygen (Bowes & Thomas 1966). This method is time and material consuming since a great number of tests must be performed to obtain the critical temperature. Moreover, locating the critical temperature is not straightforward. Worden attempted to implement this method to study the spontaneous ignition of cotton soaked with linseed oil, however, the critical temperature could not be determined due to difficulties in ascertaining the sub-critical conditions (Worden 2011). In other words, using boiled oil (oil with cobalt accelerant), Worden could not find conditions that did not ignite. This leads one to conclude that there is no safe quantity of rags soaked with boiled linseed oil, and that even a single oil soaked rag at room temperature can self-heat. In practical terms, these findings question the classical theory of self-heating that stipulates the existence of a sub-critical condition for which a material does not self-ignite. The classical theory of self-heating does not cover self-ignition reaction involving radical and catalytic reactions. New theoretical and numerical treatments remain to be developed for spontaneous ignition induced by radical and catalytic reactions.|$|R

40|$|In {{blast furnace}} ironmaking, efforts {{are made to}} {{decrease}} the coke consumption mainly by increasing the pulverized coal injection rate. This will cause changes in in-furnace reduction conditions, burden distribution and demands on raw material strength, etc. In order to maintain stable operation and minimize material losses through the off-gas, {{it is important to}} understand fines generation and behaviour in the blast furnace. The strength and reactivity of coke at high temperature, measured by the Coke Strength after Reaction (CSR) and Coke Reactivity Index (CRI), have been studied. Mechanisms of disintegration were evaluated using <b>basket</b> samples <b>charged</b> into the LKAB Experimental Blast Furnace (EBF) prior to quenching and dissection. Coke <b>charged</b> into <b>basket</b> samples was analysed with CSR/CRI tests and compared with treated coke from the blast furnace. Results from tumbling tests, chemical analyses of coarse and fine material, as well as Light Optical Microscope (LOM) studies of original and treated coke have been combined and evaluated. The results indicate a correlation between the ash composition and CSR values. Differences in the texture of the coke were determined with LOM, and a change in the coke texture during the CSR/CRI test conditions was found. The results suggest that the main reaction between coke and CO 2 during the solution loss reaction took place in isotropic areas, which was especially pronounced in coke with a low CSR. Signs of degradation were apparent throughout the coke pieces that have undergone CSR/CRI testing, but were less observable in coke reacted in the blast furnace. The results indicate that the solution loss reaction was generally limited by the chemical reaction rate in the CSR/CRI test, while in the blast furnace the reaction is limited by the diffusion rate. Coke degradation is therefore mostly restricted to the coke surface in the blast furnace. At a later EBF campaign, off-gas dust and shaft fines were sampled during operation with different iron-bearing materials. EBF process data were used to evaluate the relationship between off-gas dust amounts and furnace conditions. Characterization was focused on fines from coke, iron-bearing materials and slag formers. The graphitization degree (Lc value) of coke taken out of the EBF shaft and coke in flue dust was determined in order to trace the fines generation position. The results showed that flue dust, mainly 0. 075 mm and consisted mainly of coke particles originating from the shaft. Solution loss in the shaft had a negligible effect on coke degradation and the coke particles which ended up in the flue dust were mainly derived from abrasion at low temperatures. Sludge consisted mainly of chemically formed spherical particles < 1 μm formed in the blast furnace high-temperature area and then precipitated from the ascending gas as the temperature decreased. The amount of alkali and SiO 2 in sludge increased with higher pulverized coal injection rates and flame temperatures, which confirmed that submicron spherical particles in sludge originated from the high-temperature area around the raceway. Theoretical critical particle diameters of materials, which could be blown out with the off-gas, were estimated. Flow conditions in the top of the shaft as well as the properties of fine particles in terms of size and density are important when outflow of mechanical dust, such as flue dust, is concerned. Low off-gas temperatures, and thus lower off-gas velocities, are desirable for blast furnace operation with low amounts of flue dust.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} in use of reducing agents in blast furnace (BF) ironmaking has been significantly improved over the years. At most blast furnaces, auxiliary fuels are injected to replace some of the coke. To further reduce carbon consumption, prevention of losses and modification of raw materials or process conditions are required. In this study coke properties, their development during the descent in the BF under different process conditions, contribution to off-gas dust as well as modifications of coke aiming for reduced energy consumption in the BF have been investigated. The changes in chemical composition of coke ash, mineral phase developments and coke participation in the endothermic gasification reaction with CO 2 and coke graphitisation were studied. Also, {{in order to reduce}} the losses of material in the off-gas, a characterisation of the off-gas dust and its connection to BF conditions and coke property development in the BF has been made. Coke properties have been studied in the laboratory and in samples taken out from different parts of the LKAB Experimental BF (EBF®) during varied operational set-ups. Properties of coke from the BF high-temperature region were studied via tuyere core-drilling of samples from the EBF and an industrial-scale BF. The results showed that the coarser dry flue dust is mechanically formed. Coke fines originating from the upper shaft dominates the coarser fractions. Gasification in the shaft has a negligible effect on the high quality coke used in the EBF. The finer dust fraction, sludge, consists mainly of chemically formed spherical particles in the order of < 1 μm. Gaseous compounds formed in the BF high-temperature area precipitate from the ascending gas as the temperature decreases. Flow conditions in the top of the BF and the fluidisation properties of fine particles determine out-flow of off-gas dust. Low off-gas temperatures, and thus lower off-gas velocities, are favourable for low flue dust amounts expelled from the blast furnace. The strength and reactivity of coke at high temperature, measured in the standardised test, was compared with coke from <b>basket</b> samples <b>charged</b> into the EBF. Coke reactivity in the EBF is considerably lower for all coke types studied compared to coke studied in the CRI/CSR test. Due to higher gasification in the laboratory test the ash content is higher in that test. However, gaseous components in the EBF, such as recirculated alkali, contribute to changed ash composition in BF coke. Laboratory studies using fixed bed reactor (FBR) and a thermo gravimetric analyser (TGA) on the same material, original as well as Fe- and Ca-activated coke samples, identified the effects on reaction behaviour and were the basis for selection of the potentially best method for activating nut coke to achieve higher reactivity with CO 2 when charged into iron-bearing layers. All types of Fe- and Ca-containing activation agents used increase the apparent reaction rates for coke with low reactivity and contents of catalytic components in the ash. Activation with a solution of Fe(NO 3) 3 has the strongest effect on the reactivity, followed by slurry of Ca(OH) 2 and iron oxides (Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3 O 4) in descending order. Use of a non-specific weight loss in TGA as a basis for apparent reaction rate demands measurements in a temperature interval free from other reactions involving the activation agents. The reaction rate is reduced when CO is present in the reaction gas. Aiming for a method for determination of thermal history in BF samples the correlation between temperature and coke graphitisation was studied using three different data processing methods for removing the influence from overlapping peaks during X-ray diffraction measurements. Structural changes in coke during heat treatment are accompanied by chemical transformations in ash compounds and changed the pattern of disturbing peaks. Key ash phases were SiO 2 and mullite. At high temperatures (~ 1500 °C) the SiO 2 peaks are reduced in magnitude and finally disappear to be replaced with SiC peaks. The graphitisation was correlated with temperature and time in argon atmosphere and the impact from hot metal and slag was investigated. The graphitisation degree in coke samples from the EBF raceway and hearth was estimated and the evolution of structural order was found to be suitable in order to estimate the thermal history of coke in blast furnaces. Gaseous compounds formed in the BF high temperature area are precipitated from the ascending gas as the temperature is decreased. Flow conditions in the top of the BF and the fluidisation properties of fine particles determine out-flow of off-gas dust.

Today the degree of which the scrap mix can be optimised, and also the degree of which the melting operation can be controlled and automated, is limited by the knowledge of the properties of the scrap and other raw- materials in the charge mix. In this thesis, multivariate regression methods have been used to develop prediction models for final chemical analysis of the steel, total electric energy consumption and metallic yield. The predictions are based on composition of the raw-material mix, total consumption of injected materials (like oxygen, oil, coal, slagformers) and initial condition of the furnace (hot heel composition). A prediction model for total energy consumption for melting of the first scrap basket based on continuous measurements of electrical parameters and wall panel temperatures was also developed. The models have been used to estimate some scrap properties (chemical composition, specific electrical energy consumption, yield coefficients), evaluate the efficiency of post-combustion and to estimate the optimal time to charge the second scrap basket. The results show that it is possible to provide estimates of the levels of tramp elements (Cu, Sn, As, etc.) and alloy elements (Cr, Ni, Mo, etc.) in commonly used scrap grades based on evaluation of commonly logged process data. To ensure that the estimates remain consistent with scrap quality, it is suggested that they be updated on a regular basis. It is also discussed how the estimates of scrap properties can be used for improved process control and monitoring of scrap quality. Godkänd; 2005; 20070102 (haneit) </p...|$|R
