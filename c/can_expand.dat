5|$|Conversely, populations <b>can</b> <b>expand</b> rapidly after {{a series}} of mild winters. In lowland Britain, there was an {{increase}} of 48% following the 1970/71 winter, with many pairs spreading into deciduous woodlands where they would not normally breed.|$|E
5|$|The {{physiological}} {{similarities between}} humans and other animals, especially primates, have led to more comparative research between the two groups. Future research with animal models then <b>can</b> <b>expand</b> our own understanding of how people make decisions about instant versus delayed gratification in the real world.|$|E

5|$|A party <b>can</b> <b>expand</b> into an alliance, with up {{to three}} parties combined, {{with a total of}} 18 players. Alliances are {{necessary}} to complete more difficult challenges: including missions, quests, nation or territory driven events, and defeating notorious monsters. Much of end-game play consists of alliance forces overcoming these higher level challenges and can even allow several alliances to enter into specific instances owned by a group of players (e.g. Dynamis instances entry is controlled by an hourglass item).|$|E
5|$|Once fusion begins, the {{temperature}} of the white dwarf increases. A main sequence star supported by thermal pressure <b>can</b> <b>expand</b> and cool which automatically regulates the increase in thermal energy. However, degeneracy pressure is independent of temperature; white dwarfs are unable to regulate temperature in the manner of normal stars, so they are vulnerable to runaway fusion reactions. The flare accelerates dramatically, in part due to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability and interactions with turbulence. It is still a matter of considerable debate whether this flare transforms into a supersonic detonation from a subsonic deflagration.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium is a {{transuranic}} radioactive {{chemical element}} with symbol Pu and atomic number 94. It is an actinide metal of silvery-gray appearance that tarnishes {{when exposed to}} air, and forms a dull coating when oxidized. The element normally exhibits six allotropes and four oxidation states. It reacts with carbon, halogens, nitrogen, silicon and hydrogen. When exposed to moist air, it forms oxides and hydrides that <b>can</b> <b>expand</b> the sample up to 70% in volume, which in turn flake off as a powder that is pyrophoric. It is radioactive and can accumulate in bones, which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous.|$|E

5|$|The {{barn owl}} is nocturnal {{over most of}} its range, but in Britain and some Pacific islands, it also hunts by day. Barn owls specialise in hunting animals {{on the ground and}} nearly all of their food {{consists}} of small mammals which they locate by sound, their hearing being very acute. They mate for life unless one of the pair gets killed, when a new pair bond may be formed. Breeding takes place at varying times of year according to locality, with a clutch, averaging about four eggs, being laid in a nest in a hollow tree, old building or fissure in a cliff. The female does all the incubation, and she and the young chicks are reliant on the male for food. When large numbers of small prey are readily available, barn owl populations <b>can</b> <b>expand</b> rapidly, and globally the bird is considered to be of least conservation concern. Some subspecies with restricted ranges are more threatened.|$|E
25|$|In cuttlefish, {{activation}} of a chromatophore <b>can</b> <b>expand</b> its surface area by 500%. There may {{be up to}} 200 chromatophores per mm2 of skin. In Loligo plei, an expanded chromatophore may be up to 1.5 mm in diameter, but when retracted, it can measure as little as 0.1mm.|$|E
25|$|Weeks 13 to 28 of the {{pregnancy}} {{are called the}} second trimester. Most women feel more energized in this period, and begin to put on weight as the symptoms of morning sickness subside and eventually fade away. The uterus, the muscular organ that holds the developing fetus, <b>can</b> <b>expand</b> up to 20 times its normal size during pregnancy.|$|E

25|$|A further {{disadvantage}} is {{that the}} gas envelope around certain types of stars <b>can</b> <b>expand</b> and contract, and some stars are variable. This method is unsuitable for finding planets around these types of stars, as changes in the stellar emission spectrum caused by the intrinsic variability of the star can swamp the small effect caused by a planet.|$|E
25|$|The {{shape of}} the {{molecule}} is predicted to be an equilateral triangle. Vibrations can occur in the molecule in two ways, firstly the molecule <b>can</b> <b>expand</b> and contract retaining the equilateral triangle shape (breathing), or one atom can move relative to the others distorting the triangle (bending). The bending vibration has a dipole moment and thus couples to infrared radiation.|$|E
25|$|Some {{jellyfish}} {{populations that}} have shown clear {{increases in the}} past few decades are invasive species, newly arrived from other habitats: examples include the Black Sea, Caspian Sea, Baltic Sea, central and eastern Mediterranean, Hawaii, and tropical and subtropical parts of the West Atlantic (including the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and Brazil). Invasive populations <b>can</b> <b>expand</b> rapidly because they often face no predators in the new habitat.|$|E

25|$|Some {{unregistered}} {{staff can}} work in other roles, for example as phlebotomists (taking blood samples), ECG technicians (recording electrocardiograms) or smoking cessation therapists, a scheme currently being employed {{in a number of}} general practitioner surgeries. Others <b>can</b> <b>expand</b> their ward-based role to include these tasks and others. There are few areas of nursing practice that cannot be legally performed by suitably trained non-registered staff, although they cannot fully replace them, as they legally must be supervised (either directly or indirectly) by a fully qualified registered nurse.|$|E
25|$|A {{flattened}} head {{allows for}} digging through the substrate {{as well as}} perhaps serving as a hydrofoil. Some have a mouth that <b>can</b> <b>expand</b> to a large size and contains no incisiform teeth; catfish generally feed through suction or gulping rather than biting and cutting prey. However, some families, notably Loricariidae and Astroblepidae, have a suckermouth {{that allows them to}} fasten themselves to objects in fast-moving water. Catfish also have a maxilla reduced to a support for barbels; this means that they are unable to protrude their mouths as other fish such as carp.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, an {{increasingly}} power-hungry Vogel plans to destroy The Saints so he <b>can</b> <b>expand</b> Ultor's control {{over all of}} Stilwater. When an initial effort to kill The Saints' leadership is foiled by The Boss, the Saints respond by destroying a high-security Ultor lab. The company's executives try to rein in Vogel, so he sends their locations to The Boss, which he uses to kill them. Appointing himself chairman, Vogel hosts {{a press conference to}} denounce the Saints. Gat and The Boss open fire on the conference, forcing Vogel to retreat into his office. Destroying the building's defenses, the Boss enters and kills Vogel.|$|E

25|$|The English {{music critic}} John Steane, {{reviewing}} Simon Keenlyside's performance of this aria, wrote:Coming after the grave-diggers' scene, it is a tender yet bitterly repentant elegy on Ophelia's death. The soliloquy has no counterpart in Shakespeare and {{brings out the}} best in both Thomas and Keenlyside. From the composer it draws on the graceful French lyricism we know from the tenor solos in Mignon, adding a more complex responsiveness to the opera-Hamlet's simpler nature. For the singer, it provides an opportunity to use the refinement of his art yet rise to phrases, high in the voice, where he <b>can</b> <b>expand</b> the riches of his tones and the most heartfelt of his feelings.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{hemorrhage}} into a {{hepatocellular carcinoma}} causes severe upper right quadrant pain, {{and may be}} life-threatening, requiring emergency surgery or other emergency intervention. A tumor <b>can</b> <b>expand</b> {{the size of the}} liver several times and consequent stretching of its capsule can cause aching pain in the right hypochondrium. Other causes of pain in enlarged liver are traction of the supporting ligaments when standing or walking, the liver pressing against the rib cage or pinching the wall of the abdomen, and straining the lumbar spine. In some postures the liver may pinch the parietal peritoneum against the lower rib cage, producing sharp, transitory pain, relieved by changing position. The tumor may also infiltrate the liver's capsule, causing dull, and sometimes stabbing pain.|$|E
25|$|Markerless gait capture systems utilize {{one or more}} color cameras or 2.5D depth sensors (i.e. Kinect) to {{directly}} calculate the body joint positions from a sequence of images. The markerless system allows non-invasive human gait analysis in a natural environment without any marker attachment. Eliminating markers <b>can</b> <b>expand</b> the applicability of human gait measurement and analysis techniques, considerably reduce the preparation time, and enable efficient and accurate motion assessment {{in all kinds of}} applications. Currently, the main markerless system is the video-based motion capture with monocular camera or multiple camera studio. Nowadays, the depth sensor-based gait analysis for clinical applications becomes more and more popular. Since depth sensors can measure the depth information and provide a 2.5D depth image, they have effectively simplified the task of foreground/background subtraction and significantly reduced pose ambiguities in monocular human pose estimation.|$|E
