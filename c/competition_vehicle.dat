T4 trucks may provide assistance during the special stages, but must be homologated vehicles. T5 trucks {{do not have to be}} homologated.|$|R
5000|$|Group 7 {{cars were}} defined as [...] "two-seater <b>competition</b> <b>vehicles</b> built {{exclusively}} for speed races on closed circuit". There was no minimum production requirement necessary to earn homologation. As such, the regulations allowed manufacturers and teams freedom to create unique racing cars with no limitations on engines, tires, aerodynamics, or dimensions, such that the car had room for two seats and was enclosed in bodywork. Races for Group 7 cars were generally short sprints, with few accommodations made for driver comfort.|$|R

Drifting in the Nissan 240sx {{towards the end of}} the 2009 season showed promise, thus {{settling}} the Nissan as their <b>competition</b> <b>vehicle</b> of choice for the 2010 season. The Nissan received a motor transplant and major suspension tuning. Coupled with a V8 motor and suspension tweaks, Dai came out strong with a number of podium finishes and ended the 2010 drift season in 4th place in overall championship points.|$|E
50|$|A Burt strut, or timing strut, is a black, {{rectangular}} plate {{attached to the}} front of a <b>competition</b> <b>vehicle,</b> usually a racing car, to provide a standardised, repeatable method by which to break a timing light beam at the start and finish of events timed to high-degrees of accuracy. These events are commonly those in which competitors race against the clock, rather than physically against another vehicle, such as sprint or hillclimb races. The strut was invented in 1967 by Ron Smith; manager, chief mechanic and future husband to 1970 British sprint champion Patsy Burt. As the strut made its first appearance on the front of Burt's McLaren-Oldsmobile her name was used as its official title. In recent years the generic term timing strut has also become common.|$|E
5000|$|Allen Pezo {{built his}} first monster truck, the {{original}} Lone Eagle, {{out of a}} brand-new 1985 Chevrolet Silverado {{at the age of}} 15. After campaigning this truck, and another truck known as White Knight, for several years, he rebodied Lone Eagle and named it Predator. The truck originally started out as a 1988 Chevrolet Silverado that was on the former Lone Eagle chassis. The second Predator was an all new truck, also a Chevy Silverado. The chassis was painted yellow, but cosmetically the truck was a duplicate of the original truck. This truck was later converted to a race truck, with 12" [...] shocks, was sold and became Radioactive. Near the end of the 1980s, Allen bought an M42 tank and converted it into the <b>competition</b> <b>vehicle,</b> Predator Trax.|$|E
50|$|Although {{competitors}} {{were selected}} by Four Wheeler readers, that process didn’t actually begin until 1995. <b>Competition</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{no longer needed}} to also be street legal starting with the 2004 Top Truck Challenge. Over the years, the challenges have included an obstacle course, a mini Rubicon trail, and the Tank Trap. In 2012, Four Wheeler held the first-ever Top Truck Champions’ Challenge, pitting past Top Truck Challenge Grand Champions against one another for ultimate bragging rights. Segments from Top Truck Challenge have been broadcast on the Outdoor Channel.|$|R

5000|$|Challenge X is a {{continuation}} of the long history of student vehicle competitions sponsored by the DOE since 1987 (Challenge X a). The majority of the competitions involve high level sponsors from both the government and the automotive industry. Challenge X is the latest in these series of competitions. The goal of the competition is to guide students through the engineering design process used at many automotive manufacturers, while developing and exploring various advanced technologies which can be used to reduce energy consumption and vehicle emissions. The vice president for GM's Powertrain Division, Tom Stephens described the competition by saying:This {{is the first time that}} a student competition has emphasized the importance of fuel choice in achieving sustainability mobility. Challenge X provides the student teams an opportunity to take an open-minded well-to-wheels approach to all the issues involved in energy efficiency and emissions - including the fuel source, the propulsion system and the vehicle's real world utility and consumer appeal (Foster).When applied properly these technologies lead to more sustainable vehicle solutions. As automotive consumers have increasingly purchased large family sized sport utility vehicles over the past decade, the <b>competition</b> <b>vehicle</b> for Challenge X is the Chevrolet Equinox, a GM a mid-size crossover SUV [...] Student teams are required to maintain the stock vehicle's performance, safety, utility, and consumer acceptability all while attempting to increase its fuel economy and decrease its emissions.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} multibody dynamic analysis of a mechanically interconnected suspension, as applied to a small off-road vehicle. Interconnected suspensions use some sort of connection between the axles of a vehicle in order improve ride quality or vehicle handling. In principle, the connection may be hydraulic, pneumatic, or mechanical, but for installation in a typical passenger car, a mechanical connection would likely be impractical due to weight and complexity. In this paper, the vehicle in question is the University of Windsor SAE Baja off-road <b>competition</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and novel mechanical design is proposed. A multibody dynamic analysis is performed on the proposed design using the EoM open source multibody software developed by the University of Windsor Vehicle Dynamics and Control research group {{in order to assess}} any potential performance improvements...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} report {{outlines the}} full design process that the senior project team went through {{to develop a}} steering system for the 2018 Cal Poly Supermileage vehicle from the development to the manufacturing and testing of the senior project steering system. The team was successful in reducing {{the weight of the}} steering system from 12. 64 to 5. 85 pounds while remaining within the cost budget provided for the Cal Poly Supermileage team. The new steering system initially failed drop testing which resulted in the uprights pulling out of the bottom carbon supports. This failure was repaired with a small redesign to the steering system and retested. Testing shows that the steering system will be strong and stiff enough for proper implementation into the 2018 Supermileage vehicle. Learnings from this report will provide the club with valuable information and a prototype steering system to use as a platform to improve and implement in their 2018 <b>competition</b> <b>vehicle...</b>|$|E
