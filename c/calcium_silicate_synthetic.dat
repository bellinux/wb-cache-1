40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this thesis was {{the study of the}} synthesis conditions, crystallization and the resultant parageneses of technically important, crystalline compounds in the system CaO-SiO_ 2 -H_ 2 O. Herewith we have set a foundation for the systematic development and/or recycling of building materials based on C-S-H-phases. For the first time the Rietveld method as an analytical tool was systematically applied to such materials. A suitable refinement strategy was developed, whereby possible sources of errors and specific problems were discussed. The successful application of the Rietveld method requires precise knowledge of the crystal structures of all C-S-H-phases. For this purpose, the structural systematics in the C-S-H system have been critically reviewed and updated. Additionally all C-S-H minerals have been sorted according the degree of polymerization of their silicate anion structure. In this study both natural and <b>synthetic</b> <b>calcium</b> <b>silicate</b> hydrates were investigated. In the comparative structural study we have used such methods as XRD, DTA, IR and Raman spectroscopy, electron microprobe (EPMA), ESEM, TEM, AFM and quantitative phase analyses with the Rietveld method. Among the natural C-S-H-phases studied here were complex multiphase samples from Greenland (''mixed layering'' of reyerite and gyrolite), Fuka (Japan, fine intergrowth of foshagite and calcite) and from the Urals (14 Aa-, 11 Aa-tobermorite, clinotobermorite und diopside). Despite many investigations there are phases among the C-S-H-minerals whose structures are still poorly known or not well understood. In this study the structures of 10 Aa-tobermorite, Z-phase, xonotlite and foshagite have been in particular investigated further. To summarize, a parallel between natural and technical C-S-H phases was made in this work. For this purpose, natural <b>calcium</b> <b>silicate</b> hydrates, <b>synthetic</b> C-S-H phases in pure systems, hydrated and subsequently hydrothermally treated clinker minerals and hardened cement pastes have been examined. The results obtained regarding synthesis conditions, parageneses, thermal behavior and the influence of the carbonation contribute generally {{to a better understanding of}} the complicated phase relationships in cement systems.

40|$|Highlights - Investigated {{the fire}} {{performance}} of <b>calcium</b> <b>silicate</b> board lined cold-formed steel stud walls. - No integrity failure {{was observed in}} the 20 mm thick <b>calcium</b> <b>silicate</b> board lining. - Fall-off and cracking of <b>calcium</b> <b>silicate</b> boards were not observed in the fire tests. - Insulation failure occurred in <b>calcium</b> <b>silicate</b> board lined non-load bearing walls. - Compared the fire performance of <b>calcium</b> <b>silicate</b> board lined walls with gypsum plasterboard and magnesium oxide board lined walls. Abstract Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) wall systems are made of cold-formed steel studs and tracks, and lined with wall lining materials. Conventionally, gypsum plasterboards are used as wall lining material in LSF wall systems. The fire performance of LSF walls is mainly dependent on the type and configuration of wall lining material, which delays the heat transfer through the wall and protects the steel studs from being heated rapidly. Recently, <b>calcium</b> <b>silicate</b> board lining is increasingly used in LSF wall systems because of its improved physical and thermal properties while being lightweight, cost effective, impact and moisture resistant. However, their fire performance has not been investigated in detail. Hence two full scale fire tests were conducted on non-load bearing LSF walls lined with <b>calcium</b> <b>silicate</b> boards. For comparison purposes two fire tests were also conducted on conventional gypsum plasterboard lined LSF walls. This paper presents {{the details of this}} experimental study on the fire performance of LSF walls and the results including fire resistance levels and time-temperature profiles across the wall panels. Effects of using <b>calcium</b> <b>silicate</b> board lining are discussed by comparing the fire test results of LSF wall lined with gypsum plasterboards and previously conducted studies on magnesium oxide board lined LSF walls. The results showed that the fire performance of <b>calcium</b> <b>silicate</b> board lined walls was similar to that of conventional gypsum plasterboard lined walls, but was superior to that of magnesium oxide board lined walls. The failure criterion of these <b>calcium</b> <b>silicate</b> board lined walls was found to be insulation as opposed to being the integrity failure observed in previous studies...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{technology}} for obtaining bricks {{on the basis}} of lime-silica mixtures where chemical interactions are practically completely realized in dispersive state at the stage of preparation of binding contact maturing and raw mixture as a whole. The role of forming operation (moulding) is changed in principle because in this case conversion of dispersive system into a rock-like solid occurs and due to this the solid obtains complete water-resistance in contact with water immediately after forming operation. Theoretical basis for the developed technology is capability of silicate dispersive substances (hydrated <b>calcium</b> <b>silicate)</b> to transit in non-stable state, to form a rock-like water-resistant solid in the moment of mechanical load application during forming process. Specific feature of the proposed method is an exclusion of additional operations for autoclaving of products from the process of obtaining a <b>silicate</b> brick. <b>Synthetic</b> hydrated <b>calcium</b> <b>silicate</b> in contrast to natural ones are more uniform in composition and structure, they contain less impurities and they are characterized by dispersive composition and due to the mentioned advantages they find wider practical application. Contact-condensation binders permit to manipulate product properties on their basis and ensure maximum correspondence to the requirements of the concrete application. Raw material sources for obtaining <b>synthetic</b> hydrated <b>calcium</b> <b>silicates</b> are practically un-limited because calcium-silicon containing substances are found as in various technogenic wastes so in natural compounds as well. So the problem for obtaining hydrated <b>calcium</b> <b>silicates</b> having contact-condensation ability for structure formation becomes more and more actual one.
