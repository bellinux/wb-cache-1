500|$|Former {{technical}} director, Pep Segura, {{attributes the}} club's success to its [...] "philosophy of play": [...] "It is about creating one philosophy, one mentality, {{from the bottom}} of the club to the top". The philosophy consists of the application of total football mixed with traditional Spanish one-touch play (tiqui-taka). The total football approach was derived from the Netherlands football team through Cruyff. The total football approach requires the players to move in a fluid formation, where players can interchange positions quickly. In the youth academy, there is a large focus on technical ability, which is seen as a pre-requisite for inter-changes. An often-quoted reason for Barcelona's success is the continuity and <b>commitment</b> <b>with</b> which Barcelona follow the current philosophy of pass and move. Guardiola was the prototype of the pivotal midfielder; famous midfielders Xavi and Iniesta are its custodians.|$|E
