5|$|Chazz Palminteri as U.S. Customs Special Agent Dave Kujan. Singer {{had always}} wanted the actor for the film, {{but he was always}} unavailable. The role was offered to Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro, both of whom turned it down. The filmmakers even had Al Pacino come in and read for the part, but he decided not to do it because he had just played a <b>cop</b> <b>in</b> Heat. Palminteri became available, but only for a week. When he signed on, this persuaded the film's {{financial}} backers to support the film fully because he was a sufficiently high-profile star, thanks to the recent release of A Bronx Tale and Bullets Over Broadway.|$|E
5|$|A {{year into}} development, Activision {{proposed}} that Black Lotus be made {{part of an}} existing franchise and highlighted similarities to the True Crime series; both games were set in open worlds with plots centred on an undercover <b>cop</b> <b>in</b> a criminal organization. Sales of previous True Crime games had been disappointing, but Activision felt the innovations in Black Lotus could revitalize the franchise and make the game successful in its own right. Activision attached the game to the series and revealed {{it to the public}} as True Crime: Hong Kong in November 2009. They delayed the game until 2010 to allow further refinement. During this period Hollywood action editor Tony Ciccone was hired to consult on the game's visual identity and animations.|$|E

5|$|Frank Grimes' {{favorite}} television series, Dishonorable Discharge, ends {{after six}} seasons {{and it is}} revealed that the entire series was just an angel's dream. Grimes is outraged and determined to change the ending. Later, Mark Lilly tells his girlfriend, the half-demon Callie Maggotbone, {{that he has not}} seen his father since his sixth birthday. Mark's roommate, the zombie Randall, is touched by this and decides to document Mark's journey to find his father, so that he can become a Hollywood director. Mark is assigned by Twayne Boneraper to investigate Grimes, who has been busting people who enjoyed the ending of Dishonorable Discharge. He and Randall (who documents everything with his video camera) ride along with Grimes. In a memory sequence of Grimes', it is revealed that he was a real <b>cop</b> <b>in</b> the 1970s and worked with an undercover expert named Jimmy. He was dishonorably discharged from the force and repressed all of his memories of being a cop. Mark figures that this is why he is so angry with the ending of the series, and takes him through his past by using the same car Grimes and his partner Jimmy had. In the car, Grimes has a memory sequence again and drives to Hollywood.|$|E

40|$|Communities of {{practice}} (CoPs) {{have been identified}} as a means to enable acquisition and sharing of tacit knowledge <b>in</b> organizations. <b>CoPs</b> complement or even replace approaches where the focus is on storing and retrieving codified knowledge in documents and systems. This paper highlights some of the problematic aspects of using CoPs as a tool to improve knowledge sharing. Theories on coordination are put forward as a theoretical frame to explain the role of <b>CoPs</b> <b>in</b> organizational functioning. Our study of <b>CoPs</b> <b>in</b> the Amsterdam Police Force shows how <b>CoPs</b> <b>in</b> organizations face several dilemmas. How can CoPs be self-directing and simultaneously contribute to organizational performance? How can they utilize the IT opportunities of contacting anybody, any time, any place and simultaneously circumvent the threats of low commitment and poor mutual understanding in virtual groups? How can members of CoPs produce shared repertoire without falling in the trap of groupthink? How can CoPs act as environments for sharing tacit as well as explicit knowledge? Coordination theory suggests how members of <b>CoPs</b> <b>in</b> organizations can deal with such competing values by making situational choices that reflect paradoxical guidelines. We discuss how police officers use such paradoxical guidelines in organizational prototyping sessions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Communities of Practice (<b>CoPs)</b> are {{promoted}} <b>in</b> {{the healthcare}} sector {{as a means}} of generating and sharing knowledge and improving organisational performance. However <b>CoPs</b> vary considerably <b>in</b> the way they are structured and operate in the sector. If CoPs are to be cultivated to benefit healthcare organisations, {{there is a need to}} examine and understand their application to date. To this end, a systematic review of the literature on CoPs was conducted, to examine how and why CoPs have been established and whether they have been shown to improve healthcare practice. Methods Peer-reviewed empirical research papers on <b>CoPs</b> <b>in</b> the healthcare sector were identified by searching electronic health-databases. Information on the purpose of establishing CoPs, their composition, methods by which members communicate and share information or knowledge, and research methods used to examine effectiveness was extracted and reviewed. Also examined was evidence of whether or not CoPs led to a change in healthcare practice. Results Thirty-one primary research papers and two systematic reviews were identified and reviewed in detail. There was a trend from descriptive to evaluative research. The focus of <b>CoPs</b> <b>in</b> earlier publications was on learning and exchanging information and knowledge, whereas in more recently published research, CoPs were used more as a tool to improve clinical practice and to facilitate the implementation of evidence-based practice. Means by which members communicated with each other varied, but in none of the primary research studies was the method of communication examined in terms of the CoP achieving its objectives. Researchers are increasing their efforts to assess the effectiveness of <b>CoPs</b> <b>in</b> healthcare, however the interventions have been complex and multifaceted, making it difficult to directly attribute the change to the <b>CoP.</b> Conclusions <b>In</b> keeping with Wenger and colleagues' description, <b>CoPs</b> <b>in</b> the healthcare sector vary in form and purpose. While researchers are increasing their efforts to examine the impact of <b>CoPs</b> <b>in</b> healthcare, cultivating <b>CoPs</b> to improve healthcare performance requires a greater understanding of how to establish and support CoPs to maximise their potential to improve healthcare. </p...|$|R
500|$|The address {{provoked}} a strong {{reaction from the}} faculty, who denounced it as heretical, forcing Cop to flee to Basel. [...] Calvin, {{a close friend of}} Cop, was implicated in the offence, and for the next year he was forced into hiding. [...] He remained on the move, sheltering with his friend Louis du Tillet in Angoulême and taking refuge in Noyon and Orléans. [...] He was finally forced to flee France during the Affair of the Placards in mid-October 1534. [...] In that incident, unknown reformers had posted placards in various cities criticizing the Roman Catholic mass, to which adherents of the Roman Catholic church responded with violence against the would-be Reformers and their sympathizers.

500|$|Like Ice-T's {{gangsta rap}} albums, Body Counts {{material}} focused on various {{social and political}} issues, with songs focusing on topics ranging from police brutality to drug abuse. According to Ernie C, [...] "Everybody writes about whatever they learned growing up, and we were no exception. Like The Beach Boys sing about the beach, we sing {{about the way we}} grew up." [...] Ice-T states that [...] "Body Count was an angry record. It {{was meant to be a}} protest record. I put my anger in it, while lacing it with dark humor." [...] The spoken introduction, [...] "Smoked Pork" [...] features Ice-T taking on the roles of a gangster pretending to be seemingly stranded motorist and a police officer who refuses to aid. The track begins with Mooseman and Ice-T driving their car towards a police car, and then Ice-T asks for the gun Mooseman has and tells Mooseman to stay in the car, much to Mooseman's chagrin, as Mooseman wanted to kill the <b>cop</b> <b>in</b> this round. Ice-T then walks up to the policeman, pretending to be a stranded motorist, asking for help, but the policeman refuses, saying: [...] "Nah, that's not my job! My job's not to help your fuckin' ass out!", then telling him that [...] "my job is eatin' these doughnuts". When the officer recognizes Ice-T, gunshots are heard. The final voice on the track is Ice-T confirming his identity.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: This {{literature}} review investigates what research {{reports about the}} contribution that communities of practice (<b>CoPs)</b> can make <b>in</b> the continuing professional development (CPD) of qualified occupational therapists. METHODS: Academic databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE and ERIC) were searched and articles were included based on pre-determined criteria. Five articles {{were included in the}} review. RESULTS: The <b>CoPs</b> <b>in</b> the reviewed articles provided opportunities for knowledge sharing, knowledge translation, reflection on action and learning through boundary crossing. The presence of professionals with diverse perspectives was an important ingredient that facilitated CPD. CONCLUSION: Research into the use of <b>CoPs</b> <b>in</b> occupational therapy is sparse. CoPs could provide a CPD forum for occupational therapists whether online or face to face. Practitioners are encouraged to participate <b>in</b> <b>CoPs.</b> Further research into the use of CoPs is recommended...|$|R
