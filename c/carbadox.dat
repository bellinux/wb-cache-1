5000|$|<b>Carbadox</b> is a {{veterinary}} drug that combats bacterial infection in swine, particularly swine dysentery. In early 2004, it was {{banned by the}} Canadian government as a livestock feed additive and for human consumption, since it is carcinogenic and induces birth defects, as was shown in animal experiments. The European Union also forbids the use of <b>carbadox</b> at any level. It is approved in the United States for use in swine for up to 42 days before slaughter, but in 2016, the United States Food and Drug Administration moved to ban its use in pork, citing a potential cancer risk to humans. [...] Australia forbids the use of <b>carbadox</b> in food producing animals.|$|E

The investigation documented the use of <b>carbadox,</b> an antibiotic identified by the FDA as a carcinogen and recommended for removal from the market. The activists argued that similarity between animal and human biology inevitably led to potential crises like antibiotic-resistant bacteria.|$|E
50|$|A quinoxaline, {{also called}} a benzopyrazine, in organic chemistry, is a heterocyclic {{compound}} containing a ring complex {{made up of}} a benzene ring and a pyrazine ring. It is isomeric with other naphthyridines including quinazoline, phthalazine and cinnoline. It is a colorless oil that melts just above room temperature. Although quinoxaline itself is mainly of academic interest, quinoxaline derivatives are used as dyes, pharmaceuticals, and antibiotics such as olaquindox, <b>carbadox,</b> echinomycin, levomycin and actinoleutin.|$|E

Issues include: encouraging popular restaurants to source their food from farms that use antibiotics responsibly, ensuring that the cancer-causing swine drug <b>carbadox</b> is withdrawn from the food supply, and encouraging the FDA to collect data from farms related to antibiotic use in order to inform analysis of antibiotic resistance in humans.|$|E
50|$|Professor Haddadin {{considers}} himself a Heterocyclic Chemist whose {{contribution to this}} field of Chemistry is topped by his co-invention, with Emeritus Professor Costas H. Issidorides, of what is currently known in the chemical literature as “The Beirut Reaction”. This reaction {{can be described as}} a very simple method of making hundreds if not thousands of heterocyclic compounds some of which have antibacterial activities and anticancer properties. The latter are exemplified by the trade names of <b>Carbadox</b> and Mecadox which were marketed by the drug company: Chas. Pfizer. One compound that has been made by the Beirut Reaction is TPZ (3-amino-1,2,4-benzotriazene 1,4-dioxide) which is currently in the third stage of clinical testing as an anticancer drug. In addition to the rich chemistry of the Beirut reaction, Professor Haddadin did original work in the areas of Isobenzofuran, Isoindoles, tetrazines, quinolines, furans, pyrroles, cinnolines and indazoles. He has ninety publications in internationally refereed journals, and some 42 patents in 25 countries.|$|E
5000|$|The use of {{flumequine}} in food {{animals had}} sparked considerable debate. Significant and harmful residues of quinolones {{have been found}} in animals treated with quinolones and later slaughtered and sold as food products. There has been significant concern regarding the amount of flumequine residue found within food animals such as fish, poultry and cattle. [...] In 2003 the Joint FAO/WHO Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) withdrew the maximum residue limits (MRLs) for flumequine and <b>carbadox</b> based on evidence showing both are direct acting genotoxic carcinogens, therefore the Committee was unable to establish an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for human exposure to such residues. Subsequently, in 2006, the JEFCA, re-established the ADI having received appropriate evidence and MRLs were re-specified. The role of JECFA is to evaluate toxicology, residue chemistry and related information and make recommendations for acceptable daily intake (ADI) levels and maximum residue limits (MRLs). At its 16th session, held May 2006, the Committee on Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Foods (CCRVDF) requested information on registered uses of flumequine. As the CCRVDF did not receive any information regarding the registered uses of flumequine that they had requested, the committee members agreed to discontinue work on the MRLs for flumequine in shrimp.|$|E

Pigs fed the DFM had poorer feed efficiency d 0 to 14 (P< 0. 03), 14 to 32 (P< 0. 01), and overall (P< 0. 01) compared to those fed diets without DFM. Also, there was a trend for pigs fed diets containing Inulin to have poorer feed efficiency (P< 0. 07) from d 14 to 32 and overall when compared to pigs fed diets without Inulin. There were no additive responses for ADG or ADFI when Inulin or DFM were combined with <b>carbadox.</b> Pigs fed diets containing both the DFM and <b>carbadox</b> resulted in poorer feed efficiency (P< 0. 02) from d 14 to 32 and overall (0 to 32) than pigs fed diets without <b>carbadox</b> or DFM. Pigs fed the diet containing Inulin and <b>carbadox</b> had poorer feed efficiency from d 0 to 14 (P< 0. 04) compared to pigs fed diets without <b>carbadox</b> or Inulin.

Antibody titers in response to routine vaccination against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae were not affected by dietary treatment. There was no evidence that BIOSAF improved growth performance of nursery pigs, either alone or in combination with the <b>carbadox.</b> It is possible that the interactive effects of BIOSAF that have been reported for other in-feed antibiotics are not present when BIOSAF is combined with <b>carbadox,</b> or perhaps interactive effects are only observed when <b>carbadox</b> itself exerts a more potent stimulation of ADG in nursery pigs...|$|E
40|$|<b>Carbadox</b> is a quinoxaline-di-N-oxide {{antibiotic}} fed to over 40 % {{of young}} pigs in the United States {{that has been}} shown to induce phage DNA transduction in vitro; however, the effects of <b>carbadox</b> on swine microbiome functions are poorly understood. We investigated the in vivo longitudinal effects of <b>carbadox</b> on swine gut microbial gene expression (fecal metatranscriptome) and phage population dynamics (fecal dsDNA viromes). Microbial metagenome, transcriptome, and virome sequences were annotated for taxonomic inference and gene function by using FIGfam (isofunctional homolog sequences) and SEED subsystems databases. When the beta diversities of microbial FIGfam annotations were compared, the control and <b>carbadox</b> communities were distinct 2  days after <b>carbadox</b> introduction. This effect was driven by carbadox-associated lower expression of FIGfams (n = 66) related to microbial respiration, carbohydrate utilization, and RNA metabolism (q < 0. 1), suggesting bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects within certain populations. Interestingly, <b>carbadox</b> treatment caused greater expression of FIGfams related to all stages of the phage lytic cycle 2  days following the introduction of <b>carbadox</b> (q ≤ 0. 07), suggesting the carbadox-mediated induction of prophages and phage DNA recombination. These effects were diminished by 7  days of continuous <b>carbadox</b> in the feed, suggesting an acute impact. Additionally, the viromes included a few genes that encoded resistance to tetracycline, aminoglycoside, and beta-lactam antibiotics but these did not change in frequency over time or with treatment. The results show decreased bacterial growth and metabolism, prophage induction, and potential transduction of bacterial fitness genes in swine gut bacterial communities as a result of <b>carbadox</b> administration...|$|E
40|$|Antibiotics {{are used}} in {{livestock}} and poultry production to treat and prevent disease {{as well as to}} promote animal growth. <b>Carbadox</b> is an in-feed antibiotic that is widely used in swine production to prevent dysentery and to improve feed efficiency. The goal {{of this study was to}} characterize the effects of <b>carbadox</b> and its withdrawal on the swine gut microbiota. Six pigs (initially 3 -weeks old) received feed containing <b>carbadox</b> and six received unamended feed. After 3 -weeks of continuous <b>carbadox</b> administration, all pigs were switched to a maintenance diet without <b>carbadox.</b> DNA was extracted from feces (n= 142) taken before, during, and following (6 -week withdrawal) <b>carbadox</b> treatment. Phylotype analysis using 16 S rRNA sequences showed the gradual development of the non-medicated swine gut microbiota over the 8 -week study, and that the carbadox-treated pigs had significant differences in bacterial membership relative to non-medicated pigs. Enumeration of fecal Escherichia coli showed that a diet change concurrent with <b>carbadox</b> withdrawal was associated with an increase in the E. coli in the non-medicated pigs, suggesting that <b>carbadox</b> pretreatment prevented an increase of E. coli populations. In-feed <b>carbadox</b> caused striking effects within four days of administration, with significant alterations in both community structure and bacterial membership, notably a large relative increase in Prevotella populations in medicated pigs. Digital PCR was used to show that the absolute abundance of Prevotella was unchanged between the medicated and non-medicated pigs despite the relative increase shown in the phylotype analysis. <b>Carbadox</b> therefore caused a decrease in the abundance of other gut bacteria but did not affect the absolute abundance of Prevotella. The pending regulation on antibiotics used in animal production underscores the importance of understanding how they modulate the microbiota and impact animal health, which will inform the search for antibiotic alternatives...|$|E

40|$|Antibiotics {{are used}} for disease {{therapeutic}} or preventative effects in humans and animals, {{as well as for}} enhanced feed conversion efficiency in livestock. Antibiotics can also cause undesirable effects in microbial populations, including selection for antibiotic resistance, enhanced pathogen invasion, and stimulation of horizontal gene transfer. <b>Carbadox</b> is a veterinary antibiotic used in the U. S. during the starter phase of swine production for improved feed efficiency and control of swine dysentery and bacterial swine enteritis. <b>Carbadox</b> has been shown in vitro to induce phage-encoded Shiga toxin in Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli and a phage-like element transferring antibiotic resistance genes in Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, but the effect of <b>carbadox</b> on prophages in other bacteria is unknown. This study examined <b>carbadox</b> exposure on prophage induction and genetic transfer in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, a human foodborne pathogen that frequently colonizes swine without causing disease. S.

Furthermore, <b>carbadox</b> frequently induced generalized transducing phages in multidrug-resistant phage type DT 104 and DT 120 isolates, resulting in the transfer of chromosomal and plasmid DNA that included antibiotic resistance genes. Our research indicates that exposure of Salmonella to <b>carbadox</b> induces prophages that can transfer virulence and antibiotic resistance genes to susceptible bacterial hosts.

The additives decreased the ileal flow of purines (P = 0. 01) and tended to decrease that of bacterial nitrogen (P = 0. 07), which indicates that improved apparent ileal amino acid digestibilities were probably due to reduced bacterial protein synthesis in the ileal digesta. The additives increased the apparent ileal and faecal digestibilities of ether extract (P = 0. 01), formic acid more than <b>carbadox</b> (P = 0. 01). The apparent ileal digestibilities of crude protein and calcium were improved in the high-fibre diet (P = 0. 01) but not in the medium-fibre diet (P = 0. 87 and 0. 80, respectively). The additives decreased the lactate (P = 0. 02) and increased the acetate concentration (P = 0. 01) in ileal digesta samples 6 h postprandial. The change in lactate concentration was greater for the formic acid than <b>carbadox</b> supplemented diets (P = 0. 01). Propionate, n-butyrate and ammonia concentrations were not influenced significantly by dietary treatments. In conclusion, the positive effect of dietary <b>carbadox</b> or formic acid supplementation on the apparent ileal digestibility of protein and other nutrients depended on diet composition. The additives did not affect the true ileal digestibility in soyabean meal. The improved apparent ileal amino acid digestibilities were probably partly due to the reduced flow of bacterial nitrogen in the ileum, but this requires further investigation. vokEripainoksi saatavissa tekijält...|$|E

Pigs were allotted to 1 of 9 dietary treatments in pens of 4 at weaning in a randomized complete block design with 8 replications per treatment. Dietary treatments were arranged with a negative control diet with no dietary feed additive, a positive control with added <b>carbadox</b> or 7 treatments including added copper sulfate (CuSO₄; 0 vs. 125 ppm Cu) and added zinc oxide (ZnO; 0 vs. 3, 000 ppm Zn from d 0 to 7 and 2, 000 ppm Zn from d 7 to 28), essential oils from XTRACT 6930 at 0. 91 kg/ton, Safman (yeast cell walls) at 0. 23 kg/ton, Biosaf HR (yeast cells) at 0. 68 kg/ton. These supplements were fed alone or in combination. From d 0 to 7 experimental diets were a pelleted diet and fed in a meal form from d 7 to 28, followed by a common corn-soybean meal-based diet from d 28 to 42. Essential oil blend (cinnamaldehyde) and yeast had no (P > 0. 05) effect on ADG. Feeding <b>carbadox</b> or added trace minerals (Cu and Zn) improved ADG (P 0. 05) different. The use of added trace minerals Cu and Zn alone or in conjunction with either yeast or essential oil blend (cinnamaldehyde) results in ADG and G/F comparable to <b>carbadox.</b> In Exp. 2, 280 weaned pigs (Line 600 × 241; DNA, 5. 18 kg) were used in a 35 -d study.

Retrieved from ://WOS: 000375783900177 A total of 717 nursery pigs (PIC C- 29 × 28 and PIC L 3 × 1040, initially 5. 67 ± 0. 05 kg BW) from 2 consecutive nursery groups were used in a 35 -d growth study. The objective was to determine {{the impact of}} feeding increasing levels of By-O-Reg+ in diets with or without antibiotic on nursery pig growth performance. By-O-Reg+ is registered trademark of Advanced Ag Products, Hudson, South Dakota and is a unique mixture of essential oils primarily based on oregano. Dietary treatments were offered immediately after weaning at approximately 21 d of age and were organized in a 2 × 3 factorial with main effects of antibiotic (none vs. 55 mg/kg of <b>Carbadox)</b> and By-O-Reg+ (0, 0. 05, or 0. 10 %). Experimental diets were fed for 21 d and then fed a common diet for the final 14 d. Pens of pigs (5 barrows and 5 gilts) were balanced by initial BW and randomly allotted to treatments with 12 pens/treatment. During the period when treatments were fed (d 0 to 21), there were no interactions observed between By-O-Reg+ and <b>Carbadox</b> but increasing By-O-Reg+ improved (quadratic, P = 0. 016) G:F. Pigs fed diets with <b>Carbadox</b> had improved (P < 0. 007) ADG, ADFI, and G:F. From d 0 to 35, there was an interaction (linear, P = 0. 031) observed for ADFI with pigs fed diets without <b>Carbadox</b> having decreased ADFI as By-O-Reg+ level increased, whereas when pigs were fed diets containing <b>Carbadox,</b> ADFI increased with increasing By-O-Reg+. There were no main effects of By-O-Reg+ observed for the overall data; however, adding <b>Carbadox</b> for 21 d after weaning improved (P < 0. 015) ADG, ADFI, and final BW and tended to improve (P < 0. 087) G:F d 0 to 35. Overall, this study confirms the benefit of including a feed grade medication in nursery pig diets to improve growth performance. Increasing By-O-Reg+ in diets elicited few changes in performance, but during the test period the pigs fed 0. 05 % By-O-Reg+ had better G:F than those fed none or 0. 10 % By-O-Reg +...|$|E

The proportions of lactose-fermenting bacteria in their faeces which were resistant to chlortetracycline, <b>carbadox</b> or olaquindox were measured by a comparative plate-counting procedure. Compared to occurrence in control mice, the occurrence of antimicrobial drug-resistant bacteria was higher in mice receiving chlortetracycline (P less than 0. 001) and lower in mice receiving bambermycins (P less than 0. 005). In contrast, olaquindox and <b>carbadox</b> did not change the proportion of resistant coliforms in mice faeces. A control experiment was conducted with five groups of germ-free mice given the same flora and kept without drugs in separate isolators. No difference in the occurrence of resistant coliforms could be found between these groups.

The present experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of antibiotic alternatives (caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and <b>carbadox)</b> on the microbial ecology of swine feces in vitro. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of caffeic and chlorogenic acids were determined for several pathogens using macrobroth and agar dilution techniques. Gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. Caffeic acid inhibited four Staphylococcus aureus strains at 200 ppm or less, and two Clostridium perfringens strains at 300 ppm. Chlorogenic acid inhibited all S. aureus strains at 500 ppm, and one C. perfringens strain at 400 ppm. Effects of antibiotic alternatives on fecal microbial ecology were determined using an in vitro incubation. Caffeic acid lowered total anaerobes, Bifidobacteria, Escherichia coli, and percent E. coli (p< 0. 01). Chlorogenic acid lowered total anaerobes, Bifidobacteria, and lactobacilli (p< 0. 01), and increased acetate concentration (p< 0. 0001). <b>Carbadox</b> lowered total anaerobes, Bifidobacteria, E. coli, and coliforms (p< 0. 01), and lowered acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, and total volatile fatty acid concentrations (p< 0. 01).

40|$|This study {{assessed}} the associations between antimicrobial use and other management practices in pigs and antimicrobial resistance in generic Escherichia coli recovered from feces of weaner and finisher pigs on 39 purposefully selected farrow-to-finish farms in Ontario and 8 in British Columbia. Antimicrobials (n = 13), most frequently penicillins and tetracycline, {{were administered to}} different age groups of pigs on study farms through various routes of administration. Logistic regression was used to model risk factors to antimicrobial resistance in fecal E. coli of pigs for the following antimicrobials: ampicillin, apramycin, <b>carbadox,</b> cephalothin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, neomycin, nitrofurantoin, spectinomycin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole). Use of antimicrobials in weaner pigs compared with use in finisher pigs was associated with resistance in most models. There was phenotypic evidence of different mechanisms of resistance selection, including direct selection [use of <b>carbadox</b> was associated with <b>carbadox</b> resistance (OR = 6. 48) ]; cross-resistance [use of spectinomycin was associated with streptomycin resistance (OR = 2. 29) ]; and possible co-selection [ceftiofur use was associated with tetracycline resistance (OR = 6. 12) ]. These results provide further evidence that use of antimicrobials in pigs selects for resistance among fecal E. coli within and between classes of antimicrobials...|$|E
