40|$|Examination {{of several}} coalbeds in Walker County, Ala., Cambria, Greene, and Fayette Counties, Pa., and Raleigh and Wyoming Counties, W. Va., {{indicates}} that cleat orientations are similar throughout a vertical sequence of strata. Studies of cleat orientation {{were carried out}} in underground mines that are operating in separate coalbeds vertically above one another. The data show that over a vertical separation of 100 to 400 feet, the average difference in coal cleat orientation between mines is 0420 for the face and 08 " for the butt cleat. Variations of coal <b>cleat</b> <b>direction</b> between coalbeds examined in strip-mined areas show similar values. Cleat orientations measured at outcrops agree well with the directions measured underground, suggesting {{that the amount of}} vertical separation between coalbeds has little effect on the resulting differences in cleat directions. The largest variation of cleat directions between adjacent coalbeds occurs where a large horizontal distance separates two sample locations. Cleat orientations for deeper coalbeds are most reliable where the data are taken from directly above...|$|E
40|$|This Bureau of Mines report {{deals with}} water {{infusion}} of coalbeds, which can control methane emission at face areas during developmental mining and which may sometimes suppress dust. Studies show that water infused into the coalbed {{flows through the}} fracture system and displaces the methane in the fractures and prevents migration from the solid coal. Displaced gas migrates away from the face area that has been water infused and enters the return ventilation airways. A gradual decrease in methane emission is observed {{from the start of}} infusion until the infused zone is mined through. Depending on the permeability of the coalbed, infusion pressures ranged from 300 to 2, 200 lb/in 2. Face emissions in the Upper Kittanning coalbed were reduced by 89 pct; reductions of 38 to 79 pct were measured in the Pittsburgh coalbed depending on the relationship between the face <b>cleat</b> <b>direction</b> and mining direction. Respirable dust levels were reduced by about 75 pct on a longwall section in the Pocahontas No. 3 coalbed and by about 50 pct on a development section in the Upper Kittanning coalbed, but no statistically reliable reduction was found in the respirable dust levels in the Pittsburgh coalbed...|$|E
40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{examined}} the wellbore of a vertical gas drainage {{well in the}} Mary Lee coalbed to determine the results of specific completion procedures in coal. A jet-slotting tool was used to cut four vertical slots through the casing about 1 ft below the coalbed. Even though stimulation treatment pressure was excessive, hydraulically induced channels were contained entirely within the target coal zone. Sand-filled, induced channels were horizontal, inclined, and vertical, and were propagated in directions similar to bedding planes, rock joint, and coal <b>cleat</b> <b>directions</b> measured in the mine. Variable gas flow rates, recorded during the productive life of the well, were attributed to chronic downhole pump malfunction and the slotted casing below the production zone.

30|$|When {{the face}} cleat was {{perpendicular}} to the maximum horizontal principle stress (Fig.  6 d), no obvious breakdown point {{was found on the}} curve. The frequent movement of cleats caused more frequent fluctuations and higher fluctuating range. After the cleat opened, the fracturing fluid flowed along the <b>cleat</b> opening <b>direction,</b> which made no significant increase on the curve.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{orthotropic}} {{physical properties}} of coal cleats, the fluid-solid coupling model for stress sensibility coal seams is established. The equations of the coupling model are solved {{by using the}} finite element method. The history matching for JS- 3 well in Ordos basin is carried on by using the coupling model. The comparison between calculated results based on the coupling model and the measured values indicates their good agreement, which verifies the accuracy and rationality of the model. The effect of the permeability orthotropic coefficient of coal cleats on the pressure distribution in coal seams is analyzed. The {{results show that the}} pressure along the butt <b>cleats</b> <b>direction</b> increases with permeability orthotropic coefficient increasing; The pressure along the face cleats decreases with permeability orthotropic coefficient increasing between 0 m~ 30 m and 170 m~ 200 m, whereas both increases from 30 m to 170 m...|$|R
40|$|The Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortium (MGSC) {{carried out}} a pilot project to test storage of carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) in the Springfield Coal Member of the Carbondale Formation (Pennsylvanian System), in order to gauge the {{potential}} for large-scale CO{sub 2 } sequestration and/or enhanced coal bed methane recovery from Illinois Basin coal beds. The pilot was conducted at the Tanquary Farms site in Wabash County, southeastern Illinois. A four-well designâ an injection well and three monitoring wellsâwas developed and implemented, based on numerical modeling and permeability estimates from literature and field data. Coal cores were taken during the drilling process and were characterized in detail in the lab. Adsorption isotherms indicated that at least three molecules of CO{sub 2 } can be stored for each displaced methane (CH{sub 4 }) molecule. Microporosity contributes significantly to total porosity. Coal characteristics that affect sequestration potential vary laterally between wells at the site and vertically within a given seam, highlighting the importance of thorough characterization of injection site coals to best predict CO{sub 2 } storage capacity. Injection of CO{sub 2 } gas took place from June 25, 2008, to January 13, 2009. A âcontinuousâ injection period ran from July 21, 2008, to December 23, 2008, but injection was suspended several times during this period due to equipment failures and other interruptions. Injection equipment and procedures were adjusted {{in response to these}} problems. Approximately 92. 3 tonnes (101. 7 tons) of CO{sub 2 } were injected over the duration of the project, at an average rate of 0. 93 tonne (1. 02 tons) per day, and a mode injection rate of 0. 6 â 0. 7 tonne/day (0. 66 â 0. 77 ton/day). A Monitoring, Verification, and Accounting (MVA) program was set up to detect CO{sub 2 leakage. Atmospheric CO{sub 2 } levels were monitored as were indirect indicators of CO{sub 2 } leakage such as plant stress, changes in gas composition at wellheads, and changes in several shallow groundwater characteristics (e. g., alkalinity, pH, oxygen content, dissolved solids, mineral saturation indices, and isotopic distribution). Results showed that there was no CO{sub 2 } leakage into groundwater or CO{sub 2 } escape at the surface. Post-injection cased hole well log analyses supported this conclusion. Numerical and analytical modeling achieved a relatively good match with observed field data. Based on the model results the plume was estimated to extend 152 m (500 ft) in the face <b>cleat</b> <b>direction</b> and 54. 9 m (180 ft) in the butt <b>cleat</b> <b>direction.</b> Using the calibrated model, additional injection scenariosâinjection and production with an inverted five-spot pattern and a line drive patternâcould yield CH{sub 4 } recovery of up to 70 %...|$|E
40|$|Operations in an {{underground}} drill site have to co-exist within the mine 2 ̆ 7 s ventilation and operational system. The space {{requirements of a}} drilling operation have to be adapted to the limitations provided in available site space, which is usually defined by standard mining operations and geotechnical influences. These limitations affect borehole design, equipment positioning in the site layout and possible interactions with mining equipment and services such as water and power supply. The ventilation requirements for drill sites and the means employed vary with depth of the site, space and likely presence of gas. All drilling operations provide a particular service for the mine and in each case, drilling must operate in a manner which controls all gas, water and cuttings returning from the borehole. The various standpiping systems employed have evolved under differing influences and must cater for conditions {{during and after the}} drilling operations. The influences that gas content, pressure and flow, rib stability, <b>cleat</b> <b>direction,</b> borehole length, potential water pressure and flow have on a mine 2 ̆ 7 s operation and ventilation systems have to be considered in the design of standpipe length, diameter and fittings. Past history has a strong influence on common practice while worst case effects of a possible in-hole event should be catered for. This paper describes the early drilling systems and their limitations in ventilation and gas management. The drill site dimensions and set-up are discussed in the context of roadway conditions, equipment layout, ventilation and logistics. The use of standpiping to control all returns from the borehole is illustrated by referring to likely scenarios in a drilling site to achieve the most effective sealed depth to accommodate the worst case possibility of intersecting high pressure gas or water during the drilling operation. Practices to allow gas drainage in the return airway of a panel are described...|$|E
40|$|Characterisation of the cleat network {{serves as}} the basis for {{estimating}} the hydraulic and mechanical seam properties which in turn are fundamental for flow and geomechanical modelling in the context of underground coal mining. Cleat and cleat network geometry can be described as a function of frequency, aperture, size, orientation relative to in situ stresses, connectivity and porosity, with mineralised and un-mineralised cleats occurring. To describe these properties, CT-scans of core samples of a Bowen Basin coal in central Queensland, Australia, are analysed. A unique image processing workflow method is introduced to extract the key statistical parameters of perpendicular butt and face cleats present in a two-dimensional image. As face and butt cleats have different characteristics, the presented method distinguishes face cleats and butt <b>cleats</b> by <b>direction</b> and present detailed data for both cleat types. The results comprise cleat length, apertures, sizes, intensities, densities, shape parameter, spacing, orientation and connectivity and are therefore more comprehensive than previous cleat descriptions. Three generally different cleat geometries are considered within this study, one sample shows perpendicular face and butt cleats, the second two sets of face cleats intersected by butt cleats and the third parallel face cleats only...|$|R
40|$|This {{technical}} report presents the observations made during a study into <b>cleat</b> and joint <b>directions,</b> {{largely in the}} Pennine Basin. Field work was carried out under the BGS Research and Development programme in 199 1 - 1992. Interpretation of these observations will be made elsewhere. Cleat is the term widely in use to describe joints in coals. It is generally developed perpendicular to the bedding and there is normally one dominant set, known as the main cleat and a subsidiary, more or less perpendicular, set known as the back or butt cleat. Other sets may be developed in places, particularly in strongly faulted areas (see Figures 1, 2 and 3). Cleat is developed in all bright coals, including coalified allochthonous plant fragments and reworked clasts...|$|R
40|$|Many {{researchers}} have found that coal permeability is strongly inversely proportional to the net stress levels. However, most of the supporting lab data was gathered with hydrostatic/isotropic external stresses, quite unrepresentative of in situ conditions. It is well known that the in situ stress vectors are quite anisotropic, with the maximum principal stress (usually horizontal tectonic) being as much as 50 % greater than the minimum principal stress (whether horizontal or vertical). Also, most coal basins exhibit face cleat orientation parallel to the maximum principal stress. The inferred stress-shear strain relationship poses the question of how would the directional permeability of a coal seam be affected by changing directional external net stresses, when these are parallel, perpendicular or oblique to the face <b>cleats</b> or other <b>directions?</b> This paper addresses the question and summarises tests done on Permian age coal from China’s Sunan Basin and Australia’s Bowen Basin, utilising a True Triaxial Stress Coal Permeameter.
