5|$|I've liked Tommy {{for a long}} time. He's <b>clever,</b> infectious, {{enthusiastic}} and a hard worker. He can play as a centre-forward, behind the centre-forward or out wide, so covers a lot of positions. He's {{going to be a}} great asset to us.|$|E
5|$|After initial cutting, {{the diamond}} is shaped in {{numerous}} stages of polishing. Unlike cutting, {{which is a}} responsible but quick operation, polishing removes material by gradual erosion and is extremely time consuming. The associated technique is well developed; it is considered as a routine and can be performed by technicians. After polishing, the diamond is reexamined for possible flaws, either remaining or induced by the process. Those flaws are concealed through various diamond enhancement techniques, such as repolishing, crack filling, or <b>clever</b> arrangement of the stone in the jewelry. Remaining non-diamond inclusions are removed through laser drilling and filling of the voids produced.|$|E

Round 1 {{consisted}} of two parts: Twelve Russians and Ukrainians were playing by turn and three contestants of each team had moved in Round 2.

5|$|Around {{the middle}} of the film we show the Purim festival, a victory festival which the Jews {{celebrate}} as a festival of revenge on the Goyim, the Christians. Here I am depicting authentic Jewry as it was then and as it now continues unchecked in Poland. In contrast to this original Jewry, we are presented with Süss, the elegant financial adviser to the Court, the <b>clever</b> politician in short, the Jew in disguise.|$|E
5|$|Becoming {{increasingly}} belligerent {{toward his}} father, Riley {{moved out of}} the family home and briefly had a job painting houses before leaving Greenfield in November 1870. He was recruited as a Bible salesman and began working in the nearby town of Rushville, Indiana. The job provided little income and he returned to Greenfield in March 1871 where he started an apprenticeship to a painter. He completed the study and opened a business in Greenfield creating and maintaining signs. His earliest known poems are verses he wrote as <b>clever</b> advertisements for his customers.|$|E
5|$|Blackberry: A <b>clever</b> buck rabbit with black-tipped ears. He {{is often}} capable of {{understanding}} concepts {{that the other}} rabbits find incomprehensible. He realises, for instance, that wood floats, and the rabbits use this tactic twice to travel on water. He also works out how to dismantle the snare that almost kills Bigwig, saving him. He is one of Hazel's most trusted advisors, given the task to plan a way to rescue does from Efrafa.|$|E

5|$|For most of 1650, a Venetian {{fleet of}} 41 vessels {{maintained}} the blockade of the Dardanelles, prohibiting Haideragazade Mehmed Pasha from sailing for Crete. He was replaced {{late in the}} year by Hozamzade Ali Pasha, governor of Rhodes, who used a <b>clever</b> ploy to get through the blockade: waiting until winter, when the Venetians withdrew their forces, he assembled a small number of ships and embarked several thousand troops with many provisions on them, and sailed unmolested to Crete.|$|E
5|$|GameSpot {{gave the}} game an 8 out of 10, praising the game's characters, art, voice acting and {{challenging}} gameplay. However, {{they noted that}} at times that spoken dialogue sometimes did not match the displayed text dialogue. A reviewer of PC Gamer scored the game 69 out of 100, noting that Space Run attempts to reverse the typical tower defense concept, but ultimately relies on memorizing missions rather than <b>clever</b> design. The reviewer considered {{the best part of}} the game to be the time bonus, which is necessary to earn full reputation.|$|E
5|$|I {{liked them}} both {{because they were}} ironic and provocative {{at the same time}} but also unlike me. I am not a materialistic person, and I {{certainly}} wasn't a virgin, and, by the way, how can you be like a virgin? I liked the play on words; I thought they were <b>clever.</b> They're so geeky, they're cool. I never realized they would become my signature songs, especially the second one.|$|E

He made his Champions League debut on matchday one, as Stuttgart lost 2–1 to Rangers. He scored his first goal {{of the season in}} a 4–1 loss against Hamburger SV on 20 October 2007.

5|$|More than 20 other {{minerals}} have higher dispersion (that is difference in refractive index for {{blue and red}} light) than diamond, such as titanite 0.051, andradite 0.057, cassiterite 0.071, strontium titanate 0.109, sphalerite 0.156, synthetic rutile 0.330, cinnabar 0.4, etc. (see dispersion). However, the combination of dispersion with extreme hardness, wear and chemical resistivity, as well as <b>clever</b> marketing, determines the exceptional value of diamond as a gemstone.|$|E
5|$|Most reviews {{were very}} favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and <b>clever</b> plot construction, {{although}} a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing {{has been compared to}} that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors, Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter, and the Ancient Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{publications}} in various media {{have been written}} {{on the subject of}} Edward's character. Reviewers praised Edward as a balance between the typical <b>clever</b> kid and the stubborn kid persona. Additionally, his comedic moments have been celebrated as some of the best moments in the series. His Japanese and English voice actors, Romi Park and Vic Mignogna, have both been praised for their performances as Edward Elric and have won several awards for their work.

5|$|The HP-35 used five chips, {{and had a}} been {{developed}} by twenty engineers {{at a cost of}} a million dollars, leading the Texas Instruments engineers to think that Sinclair's aim to build a scientific calculator around the TMS0805 chip, which could barely handle four-function arithmetic, was impossible. However, by sacrificing some speed and accuracy, Sinclair used <b>clever</b> algorithms to run scientific operations on a chip with room for just 320 instructions. Constants, rather than being stored in the calculator, were printed under the screen.|$|E
