Willkie saw the damage Nazi bombing had inflicted on Britain, visiting bombed-out sites in London, Birmingham, Coventry, Manchester and Liverpool. In London during the Blitz, he walked the streets at night without helmet or gas mask (until Churchill gave him some), visiting bomb shelters. Churchill hosted Willkie at an official luncheon at 10 Downing Street and had him as a guest at Chequers. In his writings, Churchill recalled [...] "a long talk with this most able and forceful man".|$|E

[...] Carter {{said that he was}} remaining neutral about the 2010 Tonight Show conflict. [...] "I obviously have to reach out to all sides", he said. [...] "For the longest time, I personally tried to watch as many episodes of all the shows as I could to get sense of each show, and what each guy does. I don't just pick one and stick with that guy." [...] Carter researched the impact of financial decision-making on the controversy. He said he had known Leno for a long time, and O'Brien since he began working for NBC, and that these connections gave him the benefit of familiarity.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variation}} on the horizontal stack offense is called a feature, German, or isolation (or “iso” for short). In this offensive strategy three of the cutters line up deeper than usual (this can vary from 5 yards farther downfield to at the endzone) while the remaining cutter lines up closer to the handlers. This closest cutter {{is known as the}} [...] "feature," [...] or [...] "German." [...] The idea behind this strategy is that it opens up space for the feature to cut, {{and at the same time}} it allows handlers to focus all of their attention on only one cutter. This maximizes the ability for give-and-go strategies between the feature and the handlers. It is also an excellent strategy if one cutter is superior to other cutters, or if he is guarded by someone slower than him. While the main focus is on the handlers and the feature, the remaining three cutters can be used if the feature cannot get open, if there is an open deep look, or for a continuation throw from the feature itself. Typically, however, these three remaining cutters do all they <b>can</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of the feature's way.|$|E
2500|$|Carl's {{profile on}} the {{official}} EastEnders website says he is [...] "seductive" [...] and can draw people to him, especially women, and can easily fool people. He can read people quickly, understanding what they want, and can tell who has power, but is waiting for a moment when he can take it for himself because he enjoys having power. He rarely gets into fights, is unsympathetic and angry, becoming suspicious of everybody. He is entrepreneurial, pragmatic and ingenious, and {{could have been a}} successful businessman if he did not choose a life of crime, though {{it was the only way}} he knew to get women, cars and money. He will do whatever he <b>can</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> what he wants. In August 2013, Coonan said, [...] "I wouldn't mess with a man like Carl—I would stay indoors a lot more if I'd got on the wrong of someone like him. He's someone who doesn't care and who'll go to any lengths to take people out." [...] In the run-up to Carl's departure, All About Soap called him [...] "a horrible bloke".

2500|$|With {{the season}} being the show's last, plans began {{to bring back}} {{previous}} cast members {{for at least one}} appearance. Welling expressed his interest in having Annette O'Toole (Martha Kent), John Schneider (Jonathan Kent), Michael Rosenbaum (Lex Luthor), Kristin Kreuk (Lana Lang), and Michael McKean (Perry White) return. Welling even stated that he was doing [...] "everything [...] <b>can</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Michael Rosenbaum back". For Welling, Rosenbaum was the only person he could have seen portraying Lex Luthor on the series. He said that the thing that he sees inspiring Clark to become Superman would be the return of Lex Luthor and the interaction between the two characters; he explained that you cannot have Superman without Lex Luthor. At the 2010 Comic-Con, Welling stated that Rosenbaum acknowledged the importance of Lex in the series and wanted to return in some degree for the show's final season, but that he needed to iron the details out. According to Welling, the series would tease early on that Lex would return with the introduction of bodies that Lex could tap into and heal himself later in life. Welling also stated that Lana could possibly have closure by season's end.|$|E

Ringer said of his role, [...] "My {{goal is to make}} sure I keep {{producing}} each chance I get and try to make sure I am being productive, And just continue to do what I <b>can</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> better." [...] Titans head coach Jeff Fisher said of Ringer [...] "He's got great run skills and he's in good shape, He's got a sense and a knack for pushing the ball north and south. Again we just finished the first day in pads, and he's probably had 10 reps, so we still have some time." [...] Ringer also said [...] "I am definitely doing a lot of watching, Different things that they do is the reason why they're successful in the NFL, so I am kind of watching and learning and seeing how they go about their business. ... I am asking questions and they've been very helpful with me." [...] Teammate Chris Johnson said of the other backs, [...] "Basically if you have the talent to make it here, you pretty much know how to read a defense and know how to run a ball, So there are not a lot of things I can tell him as far as how to run the ball. ... (It's) just making sure I let him know some of the things I did to learn the playbook quickly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Explaining {{the concept}} of the film, Lopez stated: [...] "There's twists and turns and it's {{exciting}} [...] but it also has a message, which is what attracted me to it in the first place, which is an empowering thing." [...] Describing its message, she said [...] " [...] you're in these negative situations, negative relationships, whatever, you can get out [...] The power to get out of those things is always within yourself. That's the message of the movie." [...] When Lopez read the script, she knew she was [...] "going to have to do [...] whole sequence at the end" [...] which featured an act that required her to [...] "become a believable lean, mean fighting machine." [...] Lopez then thought she should learn T'ai Chi or Tae Kwon Do, but was worried about learning it at an expert level {{in a short period of}} time. Her personal trainer then suggested that she study Krav Maga, the [...] "official self-defense system of the Israeli Defense Forces which has recently become trendy in the States. The fighting style focuses on combating realistic scenarios with moves that are based on common, instinctual reactions", according to MTV News. Talking about the system, Lopez said: [...] " [...] levels out the playing field between men and women [...] Where it doesn't matter how big or tall or strong you are. You can actually maneuver around that. It's about getting out of the way, counter attacking and using whatever you <b>can</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the upper hand." ...|$|E
