40|$|There is {{evidence}} that Europe's manufacturing activity is increasingly concentrated in a Central European (CE) core which the IMF in a recent publication also {{refers to as the}} German-Central European supply chain. This CE <b>manufacturing</b> <b>core</b> is dominated by Germany and in addition comprises Austria and the four Visegr 1 d countries (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland). The case of Austria is particularly interesting because it is neither the primary technology leader within the country group, nor is it an offshoring destination and therefore takes an intermediate position. This study provides further empirical evidence for the growing concentration of European industrial production in the CE <b>manufacturing</b> <b>core</b> and explores in detail the structure and development of the regional supply chains over the period 1995 - 2011. This includes an analysis of the impact of international production integration on the value added share of manufacturing in the economy. The econometric results point towards differentiated effects for the members of the CE <b>manufacturing</b> <b>core</b> and the remaining EU Member States. Focusing on value added generated by the manufacturing sector, the industries which build the backbone of this regional manufacturing cluster are identified. Finally, the report investigates which factors are conducive to the intensification of international production sharing. In line with the notion of a production-investment-services nexus, it is found that (inward) FDI in the manufacturing sector is associated with higher degrees of production integration. Again, the econometric evidence suggests that some of the factors explaining international production sharing, such as the level of export sophistication, have differentiated effects for the members of the CE <b>manufacturing</b> <b>core</b> as compared to the other EU countries...|$|R

A <b>core</b> set of <b>manufacturing</b> concepts and their key relationships are identified in MCCO. Semantics are captured formally through heavyweight logic using rigorous rules and axioms. Three different levels of specialization have been identified according to the degree of specialization required. Each level provides an immediate route to interoperability for the concepts specialized from that level. MCCO enable knowledge sharing across design and production domains through core concepts. A successful initial experimental implementation has been done to demonstrate the working of MCCO...|$|R

40|$|Abstractâ€”The {{design of}} {{scalable}} and reliable interconnection networks for multicore chips (NoCs) introduces new design constraints like power consumption, area, and ultra low latencies. Although 2 D meshes are usually proposed for NoCs, hetero-geneous <b>cores,</b> <b>manufacturing</b> defects, hard failures, and chip virtualization {{may lead to}} irregular topologies. In this context, efficient routing becomes a challenge. Although switches can be easily configured to support most routing algorithms and topologies by using routing tables, this solution does not scale in terms of latency and area. We propose a new circuit that removes the need for using routing tables. The new mechanism, referred to as Logic-Based Distributed Routing (LBDR), enables the implementation in NoCs of many routing algorithms {{for most of the}} practical topologies we might find in the near future in a multicore chip. From an initial topology and routing algorithm, a set of three bits per switch output port is computed. By using a small logic block, LBDR mimics (demonstrated by evaluation) the behavior of routing algorithms implemented with routing tables. This result is achieved both in regular and irregular topologies. Therefore, LBDR removes the need for using routing tables for distributed routing, thus enabling flexible, fast and power-efficient routing in NoCs. I...|$|R
