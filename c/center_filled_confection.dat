40|$|The {{present in}} vitro study {{evaluated}} the pH values of extraradicular medium after intracoronal bleaching with 30 % hydrogen peroxide or 10 % carbamide peroxide and different associations of sodium perborate. The study {{was composed of}} 50 extracted human premolars, randomly divided into five groups, according to the bleaching agent employed for intracoronal bleaching of these teeth: a) distilled water; b) sodium perborate with distilled water (2 g/ml); c) sodium perborate with 10 % carbamide peroxide (2 g/ml); d) sodium perborate with 30 % hydrogen peroxide (2 g/ml); e) 30 % hydrogen peroxide. Coronal access was performed, followed by root canal <b>filling,</b> <b>confection</b> of a cervical intermediate base with resin-modified glass ionomer cement (Vitremer- 3 M/ESPE) and application of the bleaching agents. The teeth were stored in plastic flasks containing distilled water, using a mechanical device. Measurement of pH of the extraradicular medium (distilled water) was performed immediately and 7 days after insertion of the bleaching agents. The pH values were analysed using the two-way ANOVA and Tukey,s test at significance level of 5 %. The {{results of the present}} study confirmed the alkalinity of associations of sodium perborate and the acidity of 30 % hydrogen peroxide at the immediate period. Considering the results achieved, it can be concluded that the bleaching agents employed changed the pH of the extraradicular medium at 7 -day period...|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{dependence}} of the constituent phases of reactively sputtered AgOx mask layer on the recording and readout mechanisms of super-resolution near-field disk. At low oxygen flow ratios, the AgOx mask layer {{was found to be}} composed of an appreciable amount of Ag particles with sizes of tens of nanometers and Ag 2 O phase. After recording by a high power laser pulse, a hollow Ag cylinder that had its <b>center</b> <b>filled</b> with O- 2 was formed in the AgOx mask layer. The hollow Ag cylinder would serve as an aperture and could effectively reduce the laser spot size during readout, leading to the super-resolution effect only. At high oxygen flow ratios, the AgOx mask layer was found to be mostly composed of Ag 2 O and/or AgO phases. After recording by a high power laser pulse, a hollow Ag cylinder that had its <b>center</b> <b>filled</b> with nanosized Ag particles was formed in the AgOx mask layer. The nanosized Ag precipitates would serve as light-scattering centers and could yield strong near-field interaction with the subwavelength marks, resulting in both the super-resolution and near-field effects during readout.

50|$|The {{flower of}} the shrub is roselike when new, with rounded white petals and a <b>center</b> <b>filled</b> with many thready stamens and pistils. The ovary {{of the flower}} remains after the white petals fall away, leaving many plumelike {{lavender}} styles, each 3 to 5 centimeters long. The plant may be covered with these dark pinkish clusters of curling, feathery styles after flowering. Each style {{is attached to a}} developing fruit, which is a small achene. The fruit is dispersed when the wind catches the styles and blows them away. Wasps such as Polistes instabilis commonly feed on its nectar.|$|R
50|$|Spiral wound gaskets {{are also}} used in high {{pressure}} pipelines and are made with stainless steel outer and inner rings and a <b>center</b> <b>filled</b> with spirally wound stainless steel tape wound together with graphite and PTFE, formed in V shape. Internal pressure acts upon {{the faces of the}} V, forcing the gasket to seal against the flange faces. Most spiral wound gasket applications will use two standard gasket thicknesses: 1/8 inch and 3/16 inch. With 1/8 inch thick gaskets, compression to a 0.100 inch thickness is recommended. For 3/16 inches, compress to a 0.13 inch thickness.|$|R
40|$|A {{kernel of}} popping corn {{consists}} of a hard outer shell called the pericarp which is impermeable to moisture and a dense <b>center</b> <b>filled</b> with starch, water and some oil[8]. As the kernel is heated, internal pressure rises to approximately 135 psi, {{at which point the}} pericarp bursts. The steam and starch expands to a foam which rapidly cools forming the popcorn. Variations in the strength of the pericarp, mass and composition of the core, heating temperature and other factors contribute to the time required to pop the kernel.

40|$|AbstractThe iron-storage protein, {{ferritin}}, {{is widely}} {{found in all}} Domains of life. A conserved diiron center in ferritin catalyzes oxidation of Fe(II) and regulates storage of the resultant Fe(III) oxidation product. When this <b>center</b> is <b>filled</b> with Fe(III), in bacterial or archaeal ferritin the presence of phosphate accelerates the rate of Fe(II) oxidation. The molecular mechanism underlying this stimulatory effect of phosphate is unknown. Using site directed mutagenesis of the residues in the diiron center of the archaeal ferritin from Pyrococcus furiosus we show that phosphate facilitates displacement of Fe(III) by Fe(II) from this site. Therefore, the rate of Fe(II) oxidation increases only when the ferroxidase <b>center</b> is <b>filled</b> with Fe(III) ...|$|R
