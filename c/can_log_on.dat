40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} new system for storing and {{retrieval}} of personal life <b>log</b> media <b>on</b> ubiquitous environment. We can gather personal life log media from intelligent gadgets which are connected with wireless network. Our intelligent gadgets consist of wearable gadgets and environment gadgets. Wearable gadgets include audiovisual device, GPS, 3 D-accelerometer and physiological reaction sensors. Environment gadgets include the smart sensors {{attached to the}} daily supplies, such as cup, chair, door and so on. User can get multimedia stream with wearable intelligent gadget and also get the environmental information around him from environment gadgets as personal life log media. These life <b>log</b> media(LLM) <b>can</b> be <b>logged</b> <b>on</b> the LLM server in realtime. In LLM server, learning-based activity analysis engine will process logged data and create meta data for retrieval automatically. By using proposed system, user <b>can</b> <b>log</b> with personalized life <b>log</b> media and <b>can</b> retrieve the media at any time. To give more intuitive retrieval, we provide intuitive spatiotemporal graphical user interface in client part. Finally we can provide user-centered service with individual activity registration and classification for each user with our proposed system.

While Activity Streams record the actions of individual users and their interactions with multiple resources and services, other specifications have been developed to record the actions of multiple users on individual resources.

50|$|As a comparison, {{consider}} the Quicksort algorithm. In the worst-case scenario, Quicksort makes O(n2) comparisons; however, such an occurrence is rare. Quicksort almost invariably makes <b>O(n</b> <b>log</b> n) comparisons instead, and even outperforms other algorithms which <b>can</b> guarantee <b>O(n</b> <b>log</b> n) behavior.

Then {{he would have to}} search all of the n! permutations of the input string and test the algorithm on each until he found the one for which the algorithm runs significantly slower. But since this would take O(n!) time, it is clearly infeasible for an adversary to do this. Similarly, it is unreasonable to assume an adversary for an encoding and decoding system would be able to test every single error pattern in order to find the most effective one.|$|R
40|$|Drop-on-demand {{weed control}} is a field of {{research}} within precision agriculture. The herbicide application is controlled down to individual droplets. In this master thesis the precision spray matrix for an autonomous field robot, Asterix, is designed. Asterix is currently under development by Adigo AS, and focuses on carrot and turnip cabbage. Such applications can reduce the herbicide usage drastically. The overall system is presented with connections and timing concerns. This includes how the camera {{and the rest of}} the application is synchronized. With the use of a trigger from the camera, the time for each image <b>can</b> be <b>logged</b> <b>on</b> the printed circuit board and the inertial measurement unit can give each image an accurate time, position and orientation stamp. As a result the computer do not need to be synchronized with the rest of the system and may perform the calculations needed with relative times. An algorithm for valve control which generate spray commands from a spraymap and navigation log was designed and implemented. A second revision of the printed circuit board was designed and tested. The design chosen for controlling the micro-dispensing valves is pulse-width modulation. A much used strategy for closing solenoid valves is by discharging the energy in the coil over two schottky diodes in reverse series. However the pulse-width modulation is used to close the valve by reversing the voltage in this design. Testing of the droplet tail and laboratory experiments verify this control strategy, and the reverse voltage time can be calculated for different valves...|$|R
