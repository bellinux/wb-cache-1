Moreover, comparing with the FEW <b>corrections,</b> both of the LO and the CLO <b>corrections</b> are negligible small for the mode 1 (H − → ˜χ − 1 ˜χ 0 1) when tan β 45, respectively, since there are not enhancements from the Yukawa couplings.

25|$|Meeting this {{scalability}} {{condition is}} possible {{for a wide range}} of systems. However, the use of error <b>correction</b> brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required bits. The number required to factor integers using Shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between L and L2, where L is the number of bits in the number to be factored; error <b>correction</b> algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of L. For a 1000-bit number, this implies a need for about 104 bits without error <b>correction.</b> With error <b>correction,</b> the figure would rise to about 107 bits.

40|$|With the {{increased}} availability of regional reference networks, Precise Point Positioning (PPP) can achieve fast ambiguity resolution (AR) and precise positioning by assimilating the satellite fractional cycle biases (FCBs) and atmospheric <b>corrections</b> derived from these networks. In such processing, the atmospheric <b>corrections</b> are usually treated as deterministic quantities. This is however unrealistic since the estimated atmospheric <b>corrections</b> {{obtained from the}} network data are random and furthermore the interpolated <b>corrections</b> diverge from the realistic <b>corrections.</b> This paper {{is dedicated to the}} stochastic modelling of atmospheric <b>corrections</b> and analyzing their effects on the PPP AR efficiency. The random errors of the interpolated <b>corrections</b> are processed as two components: one is from the random errors of estimated <b>corrections</b> at reference stations, while the other arises from the atmospheric delay discrepancies between reference stations and users. The interpolated atmospheric <b>corrections</b> are then applied by users as pseudo-observations with the estimated stochastic model. Two data sets are processed to assess the performance of interpolated <b>corrections</b> with the estimated stochastic models. The results show that when the stochastic characteristics of interpolated <b>corrections</b> are properly taken into account, the successful fix rate reaches 93. 3 % within 5 min for a medium inter-station distance network and 80. 6 % within 10 min for a long inter-station distance network...|$|R
