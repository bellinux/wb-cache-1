25|$|At first {{loyal to}} his King, Carter {{expressed}} support for the Crown {{during the period of}} popular rejoicing that accompanied news of George III's repeal of the Stamp Act. However, Parliament passed additional laws obnoxious to colonial interests, and by 1772 the new Governor Dunmore exacerbated tensions. That year, Carter moved his ailing family (having lost three young daughters to unknown illnesses within 11 months) back to Nomony Hall, announcing his retirement from public life. Carter never appeared in the Governor's <b>Council</b> <b>minutes</b> (other than as present) after it voted to allow slaveholders or local authorities to punish slaves without due process. Moreover, rather than educate his sons at the College of William and Mary, Carter hired Philip Fithian as tutor.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of the weir, according to the <b>Council</b> <b>minutes,</b> was designed by the Council's Civil Engineers Department which was a concrete and reinforced steel structure. The creation of this lake proved very popular with the community as many social functions were held as recorded in the newspapers. Those activities were swimming, canoeing, various games of sport and picnics. As part of this two small bathing boxes were erected as change rooms on the flat area {{close to the edge}} of the top of the bank. In 1931 a devastating flood in Enoggera Creek occurred under-mining the supporting earth bank at the west end of the concrete weir wall, reducing the water-retaining capacity of the wall and was not able to serve its design purpose – as well the bathing boxes were washed away and were not replaced. History has not recorded the outcome of the weir but it is believed within the community that the structure was dynamited and destroyed some time in the 1940s.|$|E

"It {{is for the}} reader, in {{the light}} of {{subsequent}} events, to judge how far the Councillors were right or wrong, and to see for himself who really did the pioneer work of building up the prosperity of Perak.

These <b>Council</b> <b>Minutes</b> are the record of the work of the sowers.

[...] The first phase consists of the initiating the utilization {{of the internet and}} electronic tools and resources to enable such things as web-based payment. [...] The second phase consists of mass infusion of digital utilization such that citizens are enabled to routinely obtain presentation, reviews, and make government payments online as well as have open access to government information such as city <b>council</b> <b>minutes</b> and/or news on newly enacted legislation or public notices. [...] The third phase consists of citizen customization where ideas become intertwined in discussion over whether the structure of government institutions is and/or should persist to be fundamentally hierarchical or can be better modeled by a simple hub-and-spoke sort of complex social network.|$|E

[...] In 1915, the first permanent boardwalk was built between Philadelphia and Central Avenues, and eventually expanded along the entire length of Point Pleasant Beach, but shortened to its present length by a September 1938 hurricane that destroyed its southern portion. It evolved from a mere promenade for strolling to a more active amusement area, beginning with Charles Jenkinson's construction in the 1920s of Jenkinson's Pavilion and Swimming Pool. The boardwalk pavilion became the center of nightlife, featuring sophisticated dancing, well-known big bands, and occasional live nationally broadcast radio. Today it features a number of amusement rides, video arcades, and diverse cuisine, ranging from the traditional sausage sandwich to sushi.|$|E
