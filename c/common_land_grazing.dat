Four moneyers operated in the town under William I, William II, Henry I and King Stephen, although by 1157 this {{had been reduced to}} one and to none by 1166. Iron working and pottery production occurred within the town, with a large series of pottery kilns producing Thetford-type Ware and Early Medieval Ware found at Mile End and Middleborough. Pottery datable to the Anglo-Norman period is relatively rare in England although not in Colchester. The town’s burgesses had developed a corporate identity with established rights and responsibilities before they were enshrined in the 1189 Charter. These privileges included substantial <b>common</b> <b>land</b> <b>grazing</b> rights, fishing rights, the right to hunt foxes, hares and cats, common-ownership of the river bank and the protection of the town’s market against unauthorised markets. These last two privileges were unique to Colchester amongst English towns. The townsfolk were also exempt from paying to billet visiting royals and dignitaries, paying Scot, Lot and Danegeld, and could reclaim money paid as tolls at other towns. Together the townspeople held 1,304 acres of land in parcels of 1 to 10 acres, whilst other land and houses in and around the town were owned by the Lords of local manors around Essex. Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk held 30 acres, and a wic at Mile End.|$|E

5000|$|Almenum is a {{historic}} locality in the northern Netherlands, near Midlum, Friesland {{the site of the}} first Christian church in Friesland.

Almenum is named after the place where someone called [...] "Allaman" [...] lived. The -um suffix is derived from the West Frisian word [...] "hiem" [...] meaning [...] "home". An alternative explanation for the name of the locality is that it originally meant <b>common</b> <b>lands</b> for <b>grazing</b> cattle.

50|$|In {{order to}} keep {{accurate}} records (e.g. of birth and death) and to alert instances of straying, shepherds must perform frequent head-counts of their flocks. Dating {{back at least to}} the medieval period, and continuing to the present in some areas like Slaidburn, farms were granted fell rights, allowing them access to <b>common</b> <b>grazing</b> <b>land.</b> To prevent overgrazing, it was vitally necessary for each farm to keep accurate, updated head-counts.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{detailed}} {{survey of the}} <b>common</b> <b>land</b> and waste ground in and around Coventry was made in 1423. [...] These areas have been important for centuries as <b>common</b> <b>land</b> for <b>grazing</b> animals. In the 18th century, when Coventry was much smaller than it is now, the western areas of Hearsall Common fell within Coventry's boundaries, while the eastern areas extended far beyond them.Hearsall Common,together with Coventry's other commons, Sowe, Whitley, Barras Heath and Radford, surrounded the city and constricted its growth. The City was {{the third or fourth}} most important city in the country during the medieval period, behind London, York and, arguably, Norwich, but the jealously guarded Freeman's rights to graze animals on the commons prevented the city from expanding into these areas and growing. This tight constraint on growth is thought to be the reason why Birmingham, which was just a village until the 17th century, became the large metropolis that is now with a population three times greater than that of Coventry.|$|R

5000|$|In 1806, Prussia was {{defeated}} by Napoleon I and lost half its territory in {{the second of the}} Treaties of Tilsit. This was the trigger to the Prussian reforms, whose main goal was to modernize the Prussian state so that it may regain its lost power. As part of these reforms, serfdom was legally abolished throughout the kingdom. The peasant was allowed to become a free proprietor of land, if only he could buy it. Since peasants had no money, they were allowed to pay for the land by giving up their rights to assistance from their landlords and giving up their rights to use <b>common</b> <b>lands</b> for <b>grazing.</b> Alternatively, they could [...] "pay" [...] by giving some of their lands to their landlords. The net outcome was that the peasants' situation has worsened - they had less land to till, and no access to <b>common</b> <b>lands.</b> On the other hand, the nobles managed to buy much of the peasants' lands and gained exclusive access to the <b>common</b> <b>lands,</b> so land holding became more concentrated - just the opposite of what the reformers intended.|$|R

50|$|Around 1600, {{the village}} divided up the <b>common</b> <b>land</b> to make private land. Then, in 1616, a shared grazing {{agreement}} between Bleienbach and Wil was abolished. This loss of <b>common</b> <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> hurt many farmers economically {{and throughout the}} 17th and 18th centuries they fought among themselves and against the village council {{for the use of}} the remaining <b>common</b> <b>land.</b> Starting in the 18th century, cottage industries such as linen weaving and stocking knitting began to supplement the local economy. After 1850, agriculture became increasingly mechanized and required fewer farm workers. The resulting lack of jobs forced many residents to migrate to the cities. Agriculture remains very important and in 2005, over half of all jobs in Rütschelen were in that sector.|$|R
40|$|The British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS) {{database}} {{contains an}} unprecedented quantity {{of data on}} the movement of cattle within the UK.

Cattle farmers on the Isle of Lewis were recruited {{with the assistance of the}} local veterinary surgeon, and asked to record a range of potential risk behaviours for a one-month period. They were also asked questions about husbandry practices on their farm. Comparison of the BCMS contact data with that reported by Lewis' farmers highlighted use of <b>common</b> <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> as a significant source of contact, and potential disease transmission, between cattle that currently goes unreported; around half of responding holdings on Lewis use <b>common</b> <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> at some point during the year, and these movements are not reported to the BCMS. ...|$|R
