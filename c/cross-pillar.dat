40|$|This study {{examines}} {{a sample of}} mergers of Canadian Financial Institutions during the 1990 ’s to determine whether in-pillar, <b>cross-pillar</b> and foreign mergers are value-enhancing, and to determine possible sources of synergies behind those mergers. It develops testable hypotheses for Canadian FI mergers by synthesizing prior U. S. tests {{in the context of}} Canadian institutional arrangements. The overall results support the generality of findings of prior U. S. studies that the average abnormal return for both the acquiring and target firms is positive and statistically significant. This result suggests that acquisitions in the financial industry are, in Canada as elsewhere, driven by value-maximizing motivations. PublishedN/...|$|E
40|$|The {{external}} {{policies of}} the European Union {{may be viewed as}} the outcome of the interaction between the Member States, the European Community (acting {{in the context of the}} ‘first pillar’) and the European Union (acting on the basis of the second and third pillars). This tripartite interaction, which involves a large number of actors operating within different institutional logics, makes it challenging for the Union to conduct coherent policies, or to fulfil its objective of affirming its identity on the world stage (Article 2 TEU). The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) is a particularly developed expression of a policy designed to meet the challenge of ensuring coherence between the three EU pillars. As an alternative mechanism designed to offer coherent policy-making in the <b>cross-pillar</b> context of relations with the EU’s strategically important neighbours, the ENP does not rely on new instruments but rather offers a way of integrating existing instruments via ‘soft’ frameworks, such as European Council and Council Conclusions and Commission policy papers. This paper aims to analyse the ENP as a contribution to the EU’s efforts to evolve a more coherent external action. Ukraine will serve as an example, as the advanced implementation of the ENP towards this country offers the best illustration of the policy, in both its potential and its shortcomings. It will demonstrate that the ENP is a <b>cross-pillar</b> security policy, which draws heavily on the specific methodology developed within the framework of the EU pre-accession strategy. It will be argued that while this new formula of external action carries the potential of fostering the coherence of EU external action, its effectiveness, in policy terms, may be hampered by several inherent paradoxes and tension...|$|E
5000|$|Excavations by Tom Fanning in the 1970s {{revealed}} {{the ruins of}} an oratory, several clocháns (stone huts), some conjoined, a graveyard and about ten decorated stone slabs, of which one is a particularly fine example. This pillar measures 1.64 metres in height and is 0.6 metres wide by 0.26 metres thick and is decorated with an encircled Greek cross from which are pendant spiral designs terminating in a pelta. The stone was decorated in Early Christian times (c. 7th century). The letters 'DNE' - D(omi)ne - O Lord, are set sideways to the cross. A second stone is decorated with a large Latin cross coupled with [...] terminals and two crosslets in the upper angles. After the oratory was abandoned, the site {{was used as a}} ceallurach (children's burial ground) and further burials were made in box-like arrangements of stones, some covered with quartz and seashore pebbles. The monastic enclosure surrounding these features pre-dates the two groups of double clochans. One of the smaller <b>cross-pillars</b> has a stylised bird. Another has the inscription DNO on one side and DNI on the other. Some of the artefacts found in the excavation at Reask, including some of the cross-inscribed stones, are on display in Músaem Chorca Dhuibhne, which is in the nearby village of Baile an Fheirtéaraigh.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{also adds}} {{descriptions}} of two recently-recognized examples of carved stones with this motif at Rathlin O'Birne Island, Co. Donegal, and Caher Island, Co. Mayo; a third from Kilcorban, Co. Galway, apparently a prayerstone, {{has been published}} recently by Higgins (1987 : 410). This stone from Kilcorban and the grave-slab with monogram Chi-rho from Inis Cealtra, Co. Clare, published by de Paor (Cone 1977 : 99 fig. 23), confirm the largely western distribution of these carved symbols in Ireland noted by Hamlin (1972 : 24). In this paper a new description of the Killorglin slab, some observations on representations of the Chi-rho monogram in stone, and on stone carvings resembling manuscript pages are offered in homage to Brian ' O Cu'iv at his retirement. Recent examination of cross-slabs in counties Mayo, Kerry and Donegal suggests {{that some of those}} listed by Hamlin as definite or possible examples of Chi-rhos should now be excluded. Henry's suggestion, that the cross of arcs in relief inside the roundel {{at the head of the}} decorated <b>cross-pillar</b> at Killaghtee in south Donegal is a Chi-rho, is doubtful; we have been unable to confirm the rho suggested by her in a rubbing made recently. We are further unable to document Hamlin's suggestion (1972 : 26) that one of the tall pillars on Inishkea North, Co. Mayo, bore a Chi-rho. A rubbing of the slab at Cloonlaur, Co. Mayo, shows that the upper end of the shaft terminates in an expanded forked terminal, not as suggested by Henry (1947 : 37 n. 28, 38 fig. 8) a Chi-rho symbol. The upper right corner of the <b>cross-pillar</b> at Kilfountain, Co. Kerry, listed by Hamlin as a possible Chi-rho, is damaged.

It concludes that EU conflict {{prevention is}} being militarized {{at the expense of the}} development of a comprehensive, longer-term policy designed to tackle the root causes of conflict.

40|$|On 20 May 2008, the Court of Justice {{handed down}} its long-awaited {{judgment}} in the Small Arms case (C- 91 / 05). In a previous contribution {{in this review}} I have argued that {{from the perspective of}} the current post-Nice Treaty framework, the ECJ has rendered a judgment that is neither legally coherent nor conducive to dynamism in foreign policy conduct. It was concluded that the ECJ's bifurcated treatment of the two CFSP instruments at issue has failed to settle the dust that had been stirred up by this <b>cross-pillar</b> conflict. In this article it is argued that the Lisbon Treaty would rectify this situation by obsoleting the Court's interpretation of Article 47 TEU, and putting in place the legal equality of the Union's CFSP and its other external policies. This would erase the Court's hierarchical approach to the 'non-affectation clause', but maintain the Grand Chamber's construction that was arguably more conducive to finding the legal equilibrium between the CFSP and other EU external action such as development, while maintaining sufficient flexibility in formulating external policy...|$|E
40|$|This book reappraises the {{constitutional}} fundamentals of EU foreign relations law. The essays {{in the book}} examine and reassess {{the basic principles of}} EU foreign relations law that have emerged over 50 years of incremental Treaty-based and judicial development and explore the particular character of the EU's "external constitution". They have been written against a background of change and debate: the deliberation over the character of the appropriate constitutional framework which has surrounded the drafting of the Constitutional and Reform Treaties, the increasingly <b>cross-pillar</b> nature of much EU external action, and renewed interest in the accountability of foreign relations policy and practice to democratic and judicial review within and without the EU. This collection will be of interest not only to EU foreign relations law specialists but also to those concerned with broader constitutional issues within EU law.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to explore how the European Union deals with {{migration}} as a security matter, {{from the perspective of}} multilateralism and overall governance. Nowadays, migration stands on top of the European policy agenda. All in all, massive and ‘unwanted ’ migrants are deemed to threaten the stability of the Union. Therefore, the need has arisen to envision policies aimed at controlling and limiting inflows. Due to the security interdependence existing among EU Member States, policy coordination was a preliminary step to undertake so as to tailor a consistent and efficient migration policy towards the external world; the coordination process though, has gone through pitfalls and drawbacks which testified to the distance between European aspirations and actual achievements. Migration policy foresees to-date an increasing –although contradictoryprocess of cooperation with third countries, regions and International Organizations, to restrain inflows: although the manifold governance channels and the <b>cross-pillar</b> attempts are huge steps forward in European dealing of the matter, the security concern underneath this latter negatively impacts on their features and on overall efficiency...|$|E

It shows that the criteria established in ECOWAS to choose the correct legal basis for <b>cross-pillar</b> measures apply to cases different from those considered in the previous case-law. This provides a sound justification to the only substantial difference spotted between ECOWAS and the two previous judgements, namely the linking to the Treaty on EC (TEC) of measures lacking a particularly strong link to the latter as compared to the Second or Third Pillar (case of concurrent objectives). Like the Ship Pollution case, ECOWAS relies on an interpretation of Article 47 that favours the TEC as required by this provision, while not disregarding the pillared structure of the EU, regardless of what might be argued from its phrasing.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of counter-terrorism {{as a policy}} domain has produced a significant expansion at the European level of bureaucratic actors with competing competencies. These processes have resulted in severe coordination demands that {{have the potential to}} undermine the European Union effectiveness as a counter-terror actor. This paper addresses these issues with an analysis of the internal coherence of the institutional framework that has emerged since 9 / 11 by adapting the work of Nuttall and Christiansen on institutional coherence to the study of EU’s <b>cross-pillar</b> anti-terrorist structure. It provides an overview of the EU’s institutional actors in the field of counter-terrorism, examines the different mechanisms established to address intra and inter-institutional coordination and analyses the impact on this particular dimension of coherence by the cooperative efforts initiated in recent years by member states outside the EU framework. It argues that although the Union has been unable to provide a satisfactory response to the substantial obstacles to institutional coherence existing in this area, the reforms contained in the Lisbon treaty allow a certain degree of optimism on EU’s capacity to better address these weaknesses in the near future.

40|$|On 20 May 2008, the Court of Justice {{handed down}} its long-awaited {{judgment}} in the Small Arms case (C- 91 / 05). Two issues are {{addressed in this}} initial essay. First, three different approaches {{to the relationship between}} the Community and the Union as captured in Article 47 TEU are proposed, and it is argued that an overly strict interpretation of the ‘non-affectation clause’ could render the CFSP nugatory, whereas an exceedingly unrestricted interpretation could open up an escape route from the legal principles applicable to the Member States in their relationship with the Community. Second, the court’s judgment is assessed {{in the light of the}} various options and their underlying rationales. In the final paragraphs, the article concludes that the ECJ’s approach to the two CFSP instruments before it is incongruent, and therefore does not settle the dust that had been stirred up by this <b>cross-pillar</b> conflict.

40|$|The {{globalization}} of finance {{has brought about}} important changes in the international, regional and national regulatory structure of finance. One {{of the effects of}} financial globalization has been to increase the centralization of legislative and regulatory authority over financial markets, especially in federal states. In the United States, legislative changes in the 1990 s have facilitated <b>cross-pillar</b> and cross-states financial services sector activity. The US is moving towards a national marketplace in the finance industry under the watchful eyes of national regulators. Globalization has also led to a centralization of authority in the Australian federal state in the financial services sector through the creation of two revamped national regulators to ensure firms ’ solvency and to oversee market actors. Lütz demonstrates that the German response to the {{globalization of}} finance has been to move authority away from the Lander towards the central government (1998).

40|$|The current asylum and {{migration}} debate in the European Union is distinguished by the growing importance of somehow integrating asylum {{and migration}} issues into the Union's relations with third countries. The external dimension of {{asylum and migration}} policy is more than ever salient and is gradually leaving the stage of declarations of intent. Now work is being made of the implementation and the financial implications of this new policy area. However, {{this seems to be}} quite problematic. The difficulty-as well as the challenge-lies in the fact that coordination of asylum and migration policy and the Union's external affairs is inherently <b>cross-pillar.</b> To start with, this paper will briefly sketch the emergence and evolution of the external dimension of EU asylum and migration policy by means of an overview of the programs of the consecutive EU Presidencies, the Communications and Reports from the Commission and the Conclusions of the European Councils. Then, based on theories of governance and securitisation, we will outline a theoretical framework that aims at providing an explanation for the emergence of this new policy dimension. Finally, in an attempt to narrow down, four case studies of the external dimension will be introduced: the High-Level Working Group on Asylum and Migration, clauses and agreements on migration management and readmission, cooperation with the Balkans on asylum and migration, and temporary protection of displaced persons in case of a mass influx...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{structure}} of legal bases according to competences, instruments, and procedures; as well as legal basis litigation in the European Union {{before and after the}} introduction of the Treaty of Lisbon. Its main contribution lies in the analysis of general criteria for legal basis litigation as they have been developed under supranational EU law. It discovers several flaws inherited in the quest for the correct legal basis on the grounds of overlapping competences, divergent inter-institutional interests, and inconsistencies in the courts’ judgements. In addition, the previous pillar structure of the EU has also led to <b>cross-pillar</b> litigation which is particularly the case in the area of external relations. With the introduction of the Treaty of Lisbon, the previous pillar structure has been abolished and the former third pillar has been integrated into the realm of supranational EU law. While the intergovernmental sphere is thus minimised to the area of common foreign and security policy, legal basis conflicts will continue to occur between this area and the TFEU as well as within the TFEU itself. In addition, the Lisbon Treaty has even created new problems concerning the choice of the correct legal basis, most notably as regards the newly codified competence categories as well as the new hierarchy of legal instruments. This may require the development of new criteria for legal basis litigation in order to guarantee legal certainty in these areas for future cases...|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of the external dimension of the EU’s policy on freedom, security and justice (AFSJ), reaffirmed in the Stockholm Programme, {{it is not possible to}} speak of a single ‘AFSJ external policy’; the scope of external action reflects the fragmentation of the subject matter and of course the development of external policy has been affected by the original <b>cross-pillar</b> nature of the AFSJ. The AFSJ lacks an easily identifiable policy objective, although the concept of an ‘Area’ suggests the aim of constructing a new ‘common policy domain’, and there are ways in which we can identify certain common elements in the approach to external AFSJ policy. This chapter seeks to explore some of these distinctive elements; its purpose is not to discuss the EU’s policy priorities or initiatives in the field, but rather to set out some of the particular legal features of external AFSJ policy. First, and most fundamental, is to examine the basis for and the scope of external competence given the limited explicit provision in the Treaties for external action in the field, and the implications of the fact that competence is therefore necessarily implied. Second, this paper will turn to the legal implications of the ‘inter-pillar’ legacy of the AFSJ: the consequences this has had for the types of instrument available to the Union and the legal constraints imposed by the need to ‘police’ the boundary. And finally we will explore the relationship between Union action and Member State action: the possibility of exclusive Union competence and the mechanisms developed to manage shared competence. These features, which have been shaped by its development prior to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, will shape the post-Lisbon AFSJ for some time to come...|$|E
