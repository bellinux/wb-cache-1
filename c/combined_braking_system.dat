Larger-capacity panniers (left capacity increased from 18 to 24 litres; right capacity increased from 16.7 to 19.5 litres) with more secure cover latches and hinges were fitted. The engine was overhauled with lighter pistons and other engine modifications to reduce vibration. A catalytic converter was fitted to ensure compliance with the stricter EU emissions laws.

The Motorcycle Integral <b>Brake</b> <b>System</b> MIB, which was introduced to the market in 2006, provides motorcycle manufacturers with the possibility to realize any combined integral functionality characteristic. In addition, the pressure in each brake circuit can be built up actively independently of any rider input, so that the system reacts appropriately in any riding situation. Integral brake functions can be adapted to the philosophy of the motorcycle manufacturer, and many additional functions which were impossible until now can be incorporated.

5000|$|In 1992, the bike's looks were {{overhauled}} {{with a more}} streamlined {{and modern}} looking bodywork added. The biggest change was the introduction of DCBS, Honda's dual <b>combined</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system.</b> The DCBS system was introduced to assist rider braking where the front brake lever operates the front calipers but also proportionally applies the rear brake, while using the rear brake will engage one front caliper. Since then DCBS {{has evolved into a}} very popular addition to many Honda touring motorcycles. No major changes were made after 1992.

50|$|The VFR1200F {{incorporates}} the C-ABS <b>combined</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> sourced from the CBR600RR and CBR1000RR sport bikes. C-ABS distributes the braking forces completely electronically sending {{information from the}} brake lever into a separate braking computer before the system applies hydraulic pressure to the brakes. Anti-lock brakes (ABS) now as standard equipment rather than optional equipment {{as they were in}} the previous generation. During front brake lever activation, all the right-side caliper pistons are applied, along with four of the pistons on the left side. When the rear brake is applied, the other two left-side pistons are actuated. To maintain equal braking force when using just the front brake, the right-side pistons are slightly smaller than the left-side pistons.|$|E

The front suspension was endowed with TRAC anti-dive forks with an integrated fork brace, and the rear suspension worked even with no air pressure. Honda's first <b>combined</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system,</b> dubbed Unified Braking at the time, debuted in 1983; it engaged both front and rear brakes in unison when the brake pedal was applied.

50|$|From {{launch the}} 1400GTR {{had the option}} of an {{anti-lock}} braking system (ABS). In 2010, Kawasaki added KTRC, a traction control system, and replaced the previous ABS systems with K-ACT (Kawasaki Advanced Coactive-braking Technology), an improved system with power-assisted brake force redistribution. K-ACT is also a <b>combined</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> in which both the front and rear brakes are applied in differing amounts depending on whether the front brake lever or rear brake pedal is used. The rider is able to select, using a handlebar switch, the amount of front brake force applied when the rear brake pedal is used.The traction control uses the ABS sensors to detect when the front and rear wheel speeds differ - reducing rear wheel speed by telling the engine management system to reduce power output.|$|E
50|$|Honda’s first street {{motorcycle}} with a <b>combined</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> (then called Unified Braking) was the 1983 GL1100. This {{system was}} derived from a 1970s RCB1000 world endurance race bike. Honda made several variations of the LBS system with differing levels of complexity and integration. The Honda CBR1000F and CBR1100XX and VFR800 featured what Honda called LBS II (now called Dual CBS), a system where both levers would activate both brakes through a system of secondary pistons and proportioning/delay valves. One front brake caliper was connected to a secondary master cylinder, and the caliper was allowed to rotate slightly to apply pressure to the piston in that secondary master cylinder. Braking force was translated into pressure that {{was sent to the}} rear brake cylinder. Only the two outer pistons in the front brake calipers were directly activated by the brake lever; the center piston received pressure from the rear pedal via the proportioning and delay valve.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This study {{set out to}} {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of motorcycle antilock <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> (ABS) in reducing real-life crashes. Since the European Parliament has voted on legislation making ABS mandatory on all new motorcycles over 125 cc from 2016, the fitment rate in Europe is likely to increase in the coming years. Though previous research has focused on mostly large displacement motorcycles, this study used police reports from Spain (2006 - 2009), Italy (2009), and Sweden (2003 - 2012) in order to analyze a wide range of motorcycles, including scooters, and compare countries with different motorcycling habits. Methods: The statistical analysis used odds ratio calculations with an induced exposure approach. Previous research found that head-on crashes were the least ABS-affected crash type and was therefore used as the nonsensitive crash type for ABS in these calculations. The same motorcycle models, with and without ABS, were compared and the calculations were carried out for each country separately. Crashes involving only scooters were further analyzed. Results: The effectiveness of motorcycle ABS in reducing injury crashes ranged from 24 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 12 - 36) in Italy to 29 % (95 % CI, 20 - 38) in Spain, and 34 % (95 % CI, 16 - 52) in Sweden. The reductions in severe and fatal crashes were even greater, at 34 % (95 % CI, 24 - 44) in Spain and 42 % (95 % CI, 23 - 61) in Sweden. The overall reductions of crashes involving ABS-equipped scooters (at least 250 cc) were 27 % (95 % CI, 12 - 42) in Italy and 22 % (95 % CI, 2 - 42) in Spain. ABS on scooters with at least a 250 cc engine reduced severe and fatal crashes by 31 % (95 % CI, 12 - 50), based on Spanish data alone. Conclusions: At this stage, there is more than sufficient scientific-based evidence to support the implementation of ABS on all motorcycles, even light ones. Further research should aim at understanding the injury mitigating effects of motorcycle ABS, possibly in combination with <b>combined</b> <b>braking</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

50|$|VSA <b>combines</b> the Anti-lock <b>Braking</b> <b>System</b> (ABS) and Traction Control System (TCS) with {{side-slip}} {{control to}} help stabilize the vehicle whenever it turns {{more or less}} than desired. ABS is an existing system that prevents the vehicle's wheels from locking up under braking, especially in slippery road conditions. For the ABS to work, the system relies on the computed input from a steering angle sensor to monitor the driver's steering direction, the yaw sensor to detect the momentum of which the wheels are steering (yaw rate), and a lateral acceleration (g-force) sensor to signal the changes in speed. At the same time, the TCS will prevent wheel slip during acceleration while the side-slip control stabilizes cornering when the rear or front wheels slip sideways (during oversteer and understeer).|$|R

The prediction of brake pedal ‘feel’ in <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> simulation has been achieved using the simulation modelling package AMESim. Each individual <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> component was modelled individually before combining them into the whole <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> {{in order to identify}} the parameters and the internal components characteristics that influence the brake pedal ‘feel’. The simulation predictions were validated by experimentally measured data and demonstrated the accuracy of simulation modelling. Axisymmetric Finite Element Analysis (using the ABAQUS software) was used to predict the behaviour of nonlinear elastomeric internal components such as the piston seal and the booster reaction disc which was then included in the AMESim simulation model. The seal model FEA highlighted the effects of master cylinder and caliper seal deformation on the brake pedal ‘feel’. The characteristics of the brake booster reaction disc were predicted by the FEA and AMESim simulation modelling and these results highlighted the importance of the nonlinear material characteristics, and their potential contribution to brake pedal ‘feel’ improvement.
