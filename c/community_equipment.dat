40|$|<b>Community</b> <b>equipment</b> {{services}} are increasingly {{seen as a}} key element in enabling older and disabled people greater levels of independence and the ability to stay in their own homes. Recent government investment in the expansion of equipment services bears witness to the view that <b>community</b> <b>equipment</b> {{services are}} a cost effective way of helping promote independence among older and disabled people. Despite this, {{there is a lack of}} adequate measures of both quality and outcomes within equipment services. Those measurement tools that do exist tend to focus almost exclusively on the equipment itself, often on the impact of an individual piece of equipment on a persons functioning or have been developed in the context of another areas. This paper draws on a project that explores the outcomes and quality of <b>community</b> <b>equipment</b> services. Dimensions of quality and outcomes within <b>community</b> <b>equipment</b> services were explored using focus groups with users of equipment services, interviews with those who assess equipment needs, a survey of equipment providers and a review of previous research, whilst the development of quality and outcomes indicators was aided by cognitive interviews with users of equipment. The presentation will discuss the dimensions of quality and outcomes that were identified and the development of quality and outcome indicators. The results of this work will form the basis of the planned national User Experience Survey on equipment and equipment services that local authorities will be required to conduct early in 2008...|$|E

40|$|In the past, most {{automated}} systems employed large, {{general purpose}} processors, or very specialized applications software, usually both. An approach employing either method {{does not support}} library automation in any but the largest and best-financed libraries. Smaller libraries must either affiliate with these larger libraries or share equipment with nonlibrary applications. In either case, processing methodologies, standards and equipment decisions are made outside the affected library by persons unfamiliar with their requirements. Current technology and pricing make this approach to library automation unnecessarily restrictive to individual libraries and unnecessarily expensive for the library <b>community.</b> <b>Equipment</b> selected for its suitability in library-type problems combined with generalized data management software designed for library applications will make dedicated, self-contained systems cost effective for most libraries. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|E
40|$|Placing {{disabled}} people {{in control of}} financial resources offered a radical {{move away from the}} traditional service-led, rather than user-led, norms of social care services. This was as a result of years of campaigning by {{disabled people}}. However, the take-up of direct payments remains low both in the provision of direct payments for personal care support as well as for other aspects of social care such as the provision of daily living equipment. Cambridgeshire’s policy for offering direct payments for equipment was implemented in 2006 but since then only twelve service users have chosen to have a direct payment in order to purchase equipment themselves, rather than having it provided by the statutory <b>community</b> <b>equipment</b> service. The focus of this study is on the reasons for this lack of take-up both {{from the point of view}} of disabled people, as well as the occupational therapy staff who are effectively the gatekeepers of this resource. The study provides a background to the use of direct payments and the importance of equipment provision and goes on to link the two by presenting a snapshot of the current situation by means of two small-scale pieces of fieldwork...|$|E
40|$|IndividualBudgets (IBs) were piloted in 13 English local {{authorities}} during 2005 - 2007. Similar to personal budgets and "cash-for-care" schemes {{in other parts}} of Europe and beyond, IBs built upon previous English government initiatives to increase choice and control by users of adult social care services. A key aim of the IB pilots was to bring together resources from different funding streams towhich an individualwas entitled, and integrate or align those funding streams, thereby reducing the number of assessments and reviews; then allowthose resources to be spent flexibly according to individual wishes and needs. IBs, available only to those eligible for adult social care services and support, could include resources from up to five other funding streams which, among them, were the responsibility of three different government departments: Access to Work, Disabled Facilities Grants, Integrated <b>Community</b> <b>Equipment</b> Services, Independent Living Funds, and Supporting People. Qualitative interviews with IB lead officers and funding stream lead officers formed part of the larger evaluation of the IB pilots (IBSEN study) and revealed deep disappointment that only minimal progress with integration had been possible, with the exception of Supporting People. This article explores possible reasons for the failure to integrate funding streams despite strong aspirations at local and national levels: legislative barriers; continuing accountability to individual funding streams; concerns over destabilizing the market; and concerns over the budgetary implications of an expected increase in demand...|$|E

These alternatives are based on the condition of a land parceling scheme, which is articulated with the environment of the local hydrographic microbasins.
