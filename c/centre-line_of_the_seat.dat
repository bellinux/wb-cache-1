40|$|This note covers <b>the</b> {{development}} <b>of</b> two strain-gauge balances {{for use on}} the Whirling Arm Facility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> College.

40|$|It is {{believed}} that thin-walled structures {{have an important role}} to play in development of new concepts of structural systems. It is, therefore, important to understand <b>the</b> behaviour <b>of</b> these structures and to express this understanding in a form of changes and development of design rules. Aspect ratio is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main parameters which influences <b>the</b> behaviour <b>of</b> thin-walled structures. <b>The</b> study herein recognises <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> aspect ratio on different types of thin-walled structural behaviour. It is shown that a simply supported box girder experiences transverse membrane stresses along <b>the</b> <b>centre-line</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flanges. These stresses are sensitive to the flange aspect ratio. An idea due to Heyman is presented which assumes a box-section to be <b>the</b> assembly <b>of</b> two channels built-up toe-to-toe. A concentrated load, which acts on the web/flange junction, introduces a twisting effect. In order to keep the box in the no-twist-position a lateral force is needed. Based on this idea and a parametric finite element study, two simple empirical equations are introduced. The equations predict the magnitude and <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> transverse membrane stresses along <b>the</b> <b>centre-line</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flange. These stresses, in some cases, have a value which is several times <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> associated longitudinal stresses. The same argument is used to evaluate the transverse membrane stresses in I-beams which are regarded as being assembled by placing two channels back-to-back. Simple equations are again presented to predict these stresses. The study is extended to investigate <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aspect ratio on the bending lag phenomenon in <b>the</b> compressive flanges <b>of</b> box girders. When elastic buckling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flange is assumed negative bending lag is detected. The study also covers <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aspect ratio on <b>the</b> behaviour <b>of</b> profiled sheets when subjected to concentrated loads causing flexure. The results show that local plastic failure occurs initially in shorter spans rather than longer spans when the profile height is shallow. These anomalous results are evaluated and recommendations are given in view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evaluations. It has been the aim to provide a physical understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structural behaviour in addition to <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> stresses and deformation in the various cases studied...|$|R
