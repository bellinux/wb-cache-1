5|$|His {{thinking}} threw {{light in}} a very introspective way on the entire process of the judicial function.

5|$|John Slade was a grain merchant, {{who claimed}} that Humphrey Morley had agreed to buy a crop of wheat and rye from him, paying £16, and had reneged on the agreement. He brought the <b>case</b> <b>before</b> the Assizes in 1596, where it was heard by two judges; one of the Common Pleas, {{and one of the}} King's Bench. It was heard under assumpsit, and the jury found that Morley indeed owed Slade money. Before a {{judgment}} could be issued, Popham had the case transferred to an older version of the Court of Exchequer Chamber, which, sitting in Serjeant's Inn, allowed the King's Bench judges to sit.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{arriving}} at the hospital with Bailey and Zola, Grey is informed by the surgeons that they tried everything to save her husband's life. Grey points out {{that they should have}} ordered a head CT, much to Blake's dismay. She reviews all of her options with the doctor in-charge of Shepherd's <b>case,</b> <b>before</b> signing the papers to authorize the removal of his life support. Blake tearfully apologizes to a forbearing Grey, who then returns to his hospital room to say a final goodbye to Shepherd.

The case was on appeal from the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, and White argued the <b>case</b> <b>before</b> the United States Supreme Court, securing a favorable verdict.

5|$|Arianna {{refuses to}} talk to anyone, however, so Layton and Luke {{continue}} to question the townspeople while Emmy goes to the Scotland Yard for information regarding Evan Barde's death. With the aid of Inspectors Chelmey and Grosky, she uncovers the records for the <b>case</b> <b>before</b> heading back to Misthallery to reunite with Layton and Luke. Inspector Grosky returns with her, hoping that his own influence will help convince the town's Chief of Police, Chief Jakes, to provide further information on the case. Regardless, Chief Jakes remains adamantly opposed to the investigation of Barde's death, and demands that Layton and company leave the town within 24 hours. Despite Jakes' threats, they visit Arianna {{to explain to her}} {{what has happened to the}} town and to her father. Arianna opens up to them, and proceeds to guide them to the nearby lake before playing the Specter's Flute, which causes a prehistoric aquatic creature named Loosha to rise from the lake.|$|E

As a {{barrister}} he took part in several notable cases, including Slade's <b>Case,</b> <b>before</b> earning enough political favour to be elected to Parliament, where he served first as Solicitor General and then as Speaker of the House of Commons. Following a promotion to Attorney General he led the prosecution in several notable cases, including those against Robert Devereux, Sir Walter Raleigh, and the Gunpowder Plot conspirators. As a reward for his services he was first knighted and then made Chief Justice of the Common Pleas.|$|E

5|$|Guest came {{up against}} Sir Charles Coghlan, the senior partner of Coghlan and Welsh, in a <b>case</b> <b>before</b> the Court of the Mining Commissioner. Coghlan {{represented}} a mining company, which had pegged some gold claims on Guest's client's farm. The Commissioner gave judgment {{in favour of}} Guest, who had been instructed to oppose their registration. Following this case, although initially irritated by Guest, Coghlan invited him to join his firm in Salisbury, which Guest did in January 1912. The Salisbury office had been opened by Bernard Tancred. His passing away provided the opportunity for Guest to join the firm as a partner. For a while, the firm was known as Coghlan, Welsh, Townsend and Guest, when Townsend, one of the 1820 Settlers in the Eastern Cape, joined the firm in Salisbury. It reverted to Coghlan, Welsh and Guest, when Townsend died a little time later.|$|E
5|$|Hilary {{struggled}} with the abbot of Battle Abbey for many years over the exemption claimed by the abbey from the oversight of the Bishop of Chichester, in whose diocese it was located. The abbey had never received a papal exemption, but relied instead on its royal foundation by King William I of England, and its status as an eigenkirche, or proprietary church of the king. Under King Stephen, the abbey's claims prevailed, but after Stephen's death Hilary excommunicated the abbot, who appealed to the papacy. The appeal backfired however, as Hilary obtained from both Pope Eugenius III and Pope Hadrian IV orders for the abbot to obey the bishop. In 1157, the then Abbot of Battle, Walter de Lucy, brother of Richard de Luci the Chief Justiciar, took the <b>case</b> <b>before</b> King Henry II, at a council held at Colchester.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Apple secured Taiwanese {{rights to}} the iPad mark from the Taiwanese company Proview Electronics; in China the iPad mark was still owned by the {{subsidiary}} of Proview Electronics, Shenzhen company Proview Technology, as of April 2012. Proview Technology sued Apple over the {{rights to the}} mark in China in 2011; Apple counter-sued but lost and then appealed, with the <b>case</b> <b>before</b> the Xicheng district court, where Proview claimed $1.6 billion USD in damages. Apple paid Proview approximately $53,000 – $55,000 for the mark in 2009. In February 2012, Proview sued Apple in the Santa Clara Superior Court, alleging several permutations of fraud (intentional misrepresentation, concealment, inducement) and unfair competition. Apple paid $60 million to Proview to end the dispute in a court-mediated settlement in the Higher People's Court of Guangdong province; the U.S. case was thrown out of court.|$|E
