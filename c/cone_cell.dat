25|$|The known {{causes of}} the {{congenital}} forms of achromatopsia are all due to malfunction of the retinal phototransduction pathway. Specifically, this form of ACHM seems to result from the inability of cone cells to properly respond to light input by hyperpolarizing. Known genetic causes of this are mutations in the <b>cone</b> <b>cell</b> cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels CNGA3 (ACHM2) and CNGB3 (ACHM3) {{as well as the}} <b>cone</b> <b>cell</b> transducin, GNAT2 (ACHM4).|$|E
25|$|In general, {{symptoms}} of incomplete achromatopsia {{are similar to}} those of complete achromatopsia except in a diminished form. Individuals with incomplete achromatopsia have reduced visual acuity with or without nystagmus or photophobia. Furthermore, these individuals show only partial impairment of <b>cone</b> <b>cell</b> function but again have retained rod cell function.|$|E
25|$|Each <b>cone</b> <b>cell</b> of a bird’s retina {{contains}} an oil droplet which may contain carotenoid pigments. These droplets enhance colour vision and reduce glare. Aquatic kingfishers have {{high numbers of}} red pigments in their oil droplets; the reason red droplets predominate is not understood, but the droplets may help with the glare or the dispersion of light from particulate matter in the water.|$|E
50|$|While it {{has been}} {{discovered}} that there exists a mixed type of bipolar cells that bind to both rod and <b>cone</b> <b>cells,</b> bipolar cells still predominantly receive their input from <b>cone</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
25|$|In contrast, <b>cone</b> <b>cells</b> {{are less}} {{sensitive}} to the overall intensity of light, but come in three varieties that are sensitive to different frequency-ranges and thus {{are used in the}} perception of colour and photopic vision. <b>Cone</b> <b>cells</b> are highly concentrated in the fovea and have a high visual acuity meaning that they are better at spatial resolution than rod <b>cells.</b> Since <b>cone</b> <b>cells</b> are not as sensitive to dim light as rod cells, most night vision is limited to rod <b>cells.</b> Likewise, since <b>cone</b> <b>cells</b> are in the fovea, central vision (including the vision needed to do most reading, fine detail work such as sewing, or careful examination of objects) is done by <b>cone</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
25|$|Since each {{wavelength}} w stimulates {{each of the}} 3 {{types of}} <b>cone</b> <b>cells</b> to a known extent, these extents may be represented by 3 functions s(w), m(w), l(w) corresponding to {{the response of the}} S, M, and L <b>cone</b> <b>cells,</b> respectively.|$|R
25|$|Achromatopsia {{has also}} been called rod monochromacy and total {{congenital}} color blindness. Individuals with the congenital form of this condition show complete absence of <b>cone</b> <b>cell</b> activity via electroretinography at high light levels. There are at least four genetic causes of congenital ACHM, two of which involve cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (ACHM2/ACHM3), a third involves the cone photoreceptor transducin (GNAT2, ACHM4), and the last remains unknown.|$|E
25|$|Here, protein domains act as modules, {{each with}} a {{particular}} and independent function, that can be mixed together to produce genes encoding new proteins with novel properties. For example, the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light: three for <b>cone</b> <b>cell</b> or color vision and one for rod cell or night vision; all four arose from a single ancestral gene. Another advantage of duplicating a gene (or even an entire genome) is that this increases engineering redundancy; this allows one gene in the pair to acquire a new function while the other copy performs the original function. Other types of mutation occasionally create new genes from previously noncoding DNA.|$|E
25|$|The four spectrally {{distinct}} cone pigments {{are derived}} from the protein opsin, linked to a small molecule called retinal, which {{is closely related to}} vitamin A. When the pigment absorbs light the retinal changes shape and alters the membrane potential of the <b>cone</b> <b>cell</b> affecting neurons in the ganglia layer of the retina. Each neuron in the ganglion layer may process information from a number of photoreceptor cells, and may in turn trigger a nerve impulse to relay information along the optic nerve for further processing in specialised visual centres in the brain. The more intense a light, the more photons are absorbed by the visual pigments; the greater the excitation of each cone, and the brighter the light appears.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPeanut {{agglutinin}} (PNA) {{was known}} for its selective binding to <b>cone</b> <b>cells.</b> In the present study, we investigated whether there was any difference in PNA binding among various subtypes of <b>cone</b> photoreceptor <b>cells</b> in the dace retina. The outer segments of the long-double- and long-single-cone cells were preferentially labeled with PNA. Ultrastructural pre-embedding labeling revealed that the binding sites of PNA were confined to the calycal processes of these cells. By contrast, only slight labeling was discerned on the corresponding regions {{of other types of}} <b>cone</b> <b>cells.</b> The results indicate that PNA can distinguish the long-wavelength-sensitive cone from the short-to-middle-wavelength-sensitive <b>cone</b> <b>cells.</b> Copyright © 1997 Elsevier Science Lt...|$|R

50|$|<b>Cone</b> <b>cells,</b> or <b>cones,</b> are one {{of three}} types of {{photoreceptor}} cells in the retina of mammalian eyes (e.g. the human eye). They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light. <b>Cone</b> <b>cells</b> are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3 mm diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards {{the periphery of the}} retina. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula.The commonly cited figure of six million <b>cone</b> <b>cells</b> in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935. Oyster's textbook (1999) cites work by Curcio et al. (1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million <b>cone</b> <b>cells</b> and 90 million rod cells in the human retina.|$|R
25|$|The opsins (photopigments) {{present in}} the L and M cones are encoded on the X chromosome; {{defective}} encoding of these leads to the two most common forms of color blindness. The OPN1LW gene, which codes for the opsin {{present in the}} L cones, is highly polymorphic (a recent study by Verrelli and Tishkoff found 85 variants {{in a sample of}} 236 men). A very small percentage of women may have an extra type of color receptor because they have different alleles for the gene for the L opsin on each X chromosome. X chromosome inactivation means that while only one opsin is expressed in each <b>cone</b> <b>cell,</b> both types occur overall, and some women may therefore show a degree of tetrachromatic color vision. Variations in OPN1MW, which codes the opsin expressed in M cones, appear to be rare, and the observed variants have no effect on spectral sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{sorts of}} light receptors in a bird’s eye, rods and cones. Rods, which contain the visual pigment {{rhodopsin}} are better for night vision {{because they are}} sensitive to small quantities of light. Cones detect specific colours (or wavelengths) of light, so they are more important to colour-orientated animals such as birds. Most birds are tetrachromatic, possessing four types of cone cells each with a distinctive maximal absorption peak. In some birds, the maximal absorption peak of the <b>cone</b> <b>cell</b> responsible for the shortest wavelength extends to the ultraviolet (UV) range, making them UV-sensitive. In addition to that, the cones at bird's retina are arranged in a characteristic form of spatial distribution, known as hyperuniform distribution, which maximizes its light and color absorption. This form of spatial distributions are only observed {{as a result of}} some optimization process, which in this case can be described in terms of bird's evolutionary history.|$|E
25|$|In general, the {{molecular}} pathomechanism of ACHM is either {{the inability to}} properly control or respond to altered levels of cGMP. cGMP is particularly important in visual perception as its level controls the opening of cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (CNGs). Decreasing the concentration of cGMP results in closure of CNGs and resulting hyperpolarization and cessation of glutamate release. Native retinal CNGs are composed of 2 α- and 2 β-subunits, which are CNGA3 and CNGB3, respectively, in cone cells. When expressed alone, CNGB3 cannot produce functional channels, whereas {{this is not the}} case for CNGA3. Coassembly of CNGA3 and CNGB3 produces channels with altered membrane expression, ion permeability (Na+ vs. K+ and Ca2+), relative efficacy of cAMP/cGMP activation, decreased outward rectification, current flickering, and sensitivity to block by L-cis-diltiazem. Mutations tend to result in the loss of CNGB3 function or gain of function (often increased affinity for cGMP) of CNGA3. cGMP levels are controlled by the activity of the <b>cone</b> <b>cell</b> transducin, GNAT2. Mutations in GNAT2 tend to result in a truncated and, presumably, non-functional protein, thereby preventing alteration of cGMP levels by photons. There is a positive correlation between the severity of mutations in these proteins and the completeness of the achromatopsia phenotype.|$|E

2500|$|Finally, since a beam {{of light}} can be {{composed}} of many different wavelengths, {{to determine the extent to}} which a physical color C in Hcolor stimulates each <b>cone</b> <b>cell,</b> we must calculate the integral (with respect to w), over the interval , of C(w)·s(w), of C(w)·m(w), and of C(w)·l(w). The triple of resulting numbers associates with each physical color C (which is an element in Hcolor) a particular perceived color (which is a single point in R3color). This association is easily seen to be linear. It may also easily be seen that many different elements in the [...] "physical" [...] space Hcolor can all result in the same single perceived color in R3color, so a perceived color is not unique to one physical color.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{wavelengths}} stimulate two or {{all three}} kinds of <b>cone</b> <b>cell</b> because the spectral sensitivity curves of the three kinds overlap. Certain tristimulus values are thus physically impossible, for example LMS tristimulus values that are non-zero for the M component and zero for both the L and S components. Furthermore, LMS tristimulus values for pure spectral colors would, in any normal trichromatic additive color space, e. g. the RGB color spaces, imply negative values {{for at least one}} of the three primaries because the chromaticity would be outside the color triangle defined by the primary colors. To avoid these negative RGB values, and to have one component that describes the perceived brightness, [...] "imaginary" [...] primary colors and corresponding color-matching functions were formulated. The CIE 1931 color space defines the resulting tristimulus values, in which they are denoted by [...] "X", [...] "Y", and [...] "Z". In XYZ space, all combinations of non-negative coordinates are meaningful, but many, such as the primary locations , , and , correspond to imaginary colors outside the space of possible LMS coordinates; imaginary colors do not correspond to any spectral distribution of wavelengths and therefore have no physical reality.|$|E
50|$|Another notable {{characteristic}} of the zebrafish is that it possesses four types of <b>cone</b> <b>cell,</b> with ultraviolet-sensitive cells supplementing the red, green and blue <b>cone</b> <b>cell</b> subtypes found in humans. Zebrafish can thus observe a very wide spectrum of colours. The species is also studied {{to better understand the}} development of the retina; in particular, how the cone cells of the retina become arranged into the so-called 'cone mosaic'. Zebrafish, in addition to certain other teleost fish, are particularly noted for having extreme precision of <b>cone</b> <b>cell</b> arrangement.|$|E
5000|$|The {{human eye}} with normal vision has {{three kinds of}} <b>cone</b> <b>cells,</b> which sense light, with {{spectral}} sensitivity peaks in short (S, 420 nm-440 nm), middle (M, 530 nm-540 nm), and long (L, 560 nm-580 nm) wavelengths. These <b>cone</b> <b>cells</b> underlie human color perception under medium- and high-brightness conditions (in very dim light, color vision diminishes, and the low-brightness, monochromatic [...] "night-vision" [...] receptors, called rod cells, take over). Thus, three parameters, corresponding to levels of stimulus of {{the three types of}} <b>cone</b> <b>cells,</b> can in principle describe any color sensation. Weighting a total light power spectrum by the individual spectral sensitivities of the three types of <b>cone</b> <b>cells</b> gives three effective stimulus values; these three values make up a tristimulus specification of the objective color of the light spectrum. The three parameters, denoted S, M, and L, can be indicated using a 3-dimensional space, called LMS color space, which is one of many color spaces which have been devised to help quantify human color vision.|$|R

50|$|The von Kries {{chromatic}} adaptation method {{is a technique}} that is sometimes used in camera image processing.

5000|$|Cones require {{significantly}} brighter light (i.e., {{a larger}} numbers of photons) {{in order to produce}} a signal. In humans, there are three different types of <b>cone</b> <b>cell,</b> distinguished by their pattern of response to different wavelengths of light. Color experience is calculated from these three distinct signals, perhaps via an opponent process. [...] The three types of <b>cone</b> <b>cell</b> respond (roughly) to light of short, medium, and long wavelengths. Note that, due to the principle of univariance, the firing of the cell depends upon only the number of photons absorbed. The different responses of the three types of cone cells are determined by the likelihoods that their respective photoreceptor proteins will absorb photons of different wavelengths. So, for example, an L <b>cone</b> <b>cell</b> contains a photoreceptor protein that more readily absorbs long wavelengths of light (i.e., more [...] "red"). Light of a shorter wavelength can also produce the same response, but it must be much brighter to do so.|$|E
50|$|In 2012 it {{was found}} that Antico had a {{genotype}} for potential tetrachromacy, a genetic condition that gives her four types of <b>cone</b> <b>cell</b> classes in her eyes (normal color vision humans only have three <b>cone</b> <b>cell</b> classes). Her extra cone class provides additional sensitivity in the region between the normal middle- and long-wavelength sensitive cones. One advantage provided by this extra cone class appears to be an enhancement of color in shadow and in dim lighting. Antico discovered her condition after collectors and students had begun sending her articles about the condition, after viewing her work.|$|E
