2500|$|Ishmael was {{fourteen}} years old when Abraham's son Isaac was born to a different mother, Sarah. Sarah had finally borne her own child, {{even though she had}} passed her <b>child-bearing</b> <b>period.</b> When she found Ishmael teasing Isaac, Sarah told Abraham to send both Ishmael and Hagar away. She declared that Ishmael would not share in Isaac's inheritance. Abraham was greatly distressed by his wife's words and sought the advice of his God. God told Abraham not to be distressed but to do as his wife commanded. God reassured Abraham that [...] "in Isaac shall seed be called to thee." [...] He also said that Ishmael would make a nation, [...] "because he is thy seed".|$|E
40|$|Being {{pregnant}} {{and becoming a}} mother are life highlights. We expect pregnancy and new parenthood {{to be filled with}} wonderment, hope, and anticipation. But these are also times when women are vulnerable to depression. In the best of circumstances, the <b>child-bearing</b> <b>period</b> from conception through the first year of life (prenatal through postpartum) is fraught with ups and downs. When the downs are depression, the mother needs treatment...|$|E
40|$|Takayasu {{arteritis}} {{is a rare}} idiopathic large-vessel vasculitis {{that involves}} the aorta and its major branches. It affects young women in their <b>child-bearing</b> <b>period.</b> We present {{a case of a}} 32 -year-old lady with a history of remittent fever. Magnetic resonance angiography and arch aortogram showed aortic involvement with critical stenosis of both carotid and subclavian arteries. She also had critical ostial left main and right coronary artery stenosis as well as severe renal arteries involvement. The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. She did well and after 12 months she got pregnant. She had an uneventful pregnancy and delivery without flaring of symptoms...|$|E
30|$|This study {{included}} 2, 563 infertile patients submitted to diagnostic or operative laparoscopy (Table  1). They {{were in the}} <b>child-bearing</b> <b>period</b> {{with a mean age}} of 24.5  years and mean parity of 1. Preoperatively, TVS was done for all cases that failed to detect any paraovarian echogenic condensation in all cases. Body mass index was calculated for all cases. Its mean was 29.4 with statistically insignificant correlation to lipomesossalpinx (P[*]=[*] 0.12). Significant lipomesosalpinx was diagnosed in 145 cases (5.7  %). In all but seven cases, lipomesosalpinx was diagnosed bilaterally (99.7  %). Infertility was unexplained by laparoscopy in 621 cases (24.3  %) while the cause of infertility could be explained in 1, 942 (75.7  %) of the cases. Lipomesosalpinx was diagnosed in 46 cases (7.4  %) and 79 (3.9  %) in both groups respectively without statistically significant difference (P[*]=[*] 0.48). Biopsy of lipomesosalpinx revealed a normal adipose tissue in all cases. Surgical management of lipomesosalpinx was done, but data were excluded according to the aim of this study.|$|E
40|$|Low-dose Warfarin (LDW) {{throughout}} {{pregnancy was}} suggested to provide {{safe and effective}} anticoagulation in pregnant patients with mechanical heart valve prosthesis (MHVP). We aimed to study its rate of failure in achieving target INR of those patients. Methods: Group A: 100 pregnant patients with mitral (+aortic; 24 %) MHVP were randomized in a 3 : 1 ratio, to either receive LDW (< 5  mg/day) or phenindione (< 100  mg/day) throughout pregnancy; respectively. Group B: 100 females in the <b>child-bearing</b> <b>period</b> with mitral (+aortic; 19 %) MHVP were randomized similarly and followed same dosage limits. Both groups targeted an INR of 2. 5 – 3. 5. Patients failing to reach this target were shifted to the other oral anticoagulant (OA). Aspirin (100  mg/day) was supplemented on the 2 nd trimester / 4 th follow-up month (Group B). Results: Primary outcome: 20 patients in Group A (26. 7 %; 16. 7 – 36. 7 %; P =  0. 003) and 4 patients in Group B (5. 3 %; 0. 23 – 10. 37 %; P =  0. 5) failed to achieve target INR; all being on LDW. Secondary outcomes: Group A received larger doses of either OA (P <  0. 0001) achieved lower INR values (P <  0. 0001) and had higher failure rates, compared to Group B (relative risk: 5; 1. 8 – 13. 9); (P =  0. 001). We had no patient mortality or fetal embryopathy but 9 spontaneous abortions and 2 stillbirths related to insignificantly higher OA doses and lower INR achieved (P =  0. 039). Conclusions: LDW may be insufficient to reach INR target, especially in high-risk pregnant patients with MHVP. Phenindione can offer an effective and probably safe alternative. NCT 01758640...|$|E
