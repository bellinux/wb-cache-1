Therefore, the Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965–1985), led by George Bornemissza of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, released forty-nine species of dung beetle, {{to reduce the amount}} of dung and therefore also the potential breeding sites of the fly.|$|E

She focused her attention on working-class family men, the majority of whom were outraged at the description Josephine gave of the examination women were forced to undergo; she called the process surgical or steel rape. Although she persuaded many members of her audiences, she faced significant opposition, which put her in danger. At one meeting pimps threw <b>cow</b> <b>dung</b> at her; at another, the windows of her hotel were smashed, while at a third, threats were made to burn down the building where she was hosting a meeting.|$|E

5|$|Traditional {{arts and}} crafts are {{produced}} throughout the country, although most originated as functional items rather than purely for decoration. Woven baskets and bowls are especially common. Imigongo, a unique <b>cow</b> <b>dung</b> art, is produced in the southeast of Rwanda, with a history dating back to when the region {{was part of the}} independent Gisaka kingdom. The dung is mixed with natural soils of various colours and painted into patterned ridges to form geometric shapes. Other crafts include pottery and wood carving. Traditional housing styles make use of locally available materials; circular or rectangular mud homes with grass-thatched roofs (known as nyakatsi) are the most common. The government has initiated a programme to replace these with more modern materials such as corrugated iron.|$|E
5|$|The growing {{popularity}} of worship of a more benign form of Kaali, as Daksinakali, is often attributed to Krishnananda Agamavagisha. He was a noted Bengali leader of the 17th century, author of a Tantra encyclopedia called Tantrasara. According to hearsay - Kaali appeared {{to him in a}} dream and told him to popularize her in a particular form that would appear to him the following day. The next morning he observed a young woman making <b>cow</b> <b>dung</b> patties. While placing a patty on a wall, she stood in the alidha pose, with her right foot forward. When she saw Krishnananda watching her, she was embarrassed and put her tongue between her teeth. Krishnananada took his previous worship of Kali out of the cremation grounds and into a more domestic setting. Krishnananda Vagamavagisha was also the guru of the Kaali devotee and poet Ramprasad Sen.|$|E
5|$|In Bengal, on {{the night}} of the sixth day after childbirth, a number of items may be placed in the lying-in chamber in {{deference}} to Shashthi, such as an earthen pitcher of water covered with a napkin, offerings of husked rice, cooked rice, bananas and sweets, bangles, and pieces of gold and silver. A pen and paper are also kept in the room, because it is believed that Shashthi (or, according to some traditions, Chitragupta or Brahma) comes into the home after everyone is asleep and writes the child's fortune on the paper with invisible ink. In Bihar, the sixth day ceremony is called Chathi or Chati ("sixth") and Shashthi is known by the epithet Chati Mata ("Mother Chati"). A lump of <b>cow</b> <b>dung</b> dressed in red cloth or paper and covered with vermilion, symbolising the goddess, is kept in the lying-in room. Here, the new-born baby is oiled and dressed in new clothes and rings and then named; a feast follows this ceremony.

30|$|The {{main source}} of energy for the local people in Gudo Beret Kebele is derived from biomass (e.g., fuelwood, crop residues, and <b>cow</b> <b>dungs).</b> Thus, {{dissemination}} of energy-efficient technologies (e.g., energy-saving stoves), creating job opportunities, family planning, strict government energy policy, and provision of alternative energy (i.e., other than biomass energy) from the government with less taxation may decrease the bad consequences. Solutions to alleviate the unsustainable use of biomass energy, in turn, reduce environmental degradation in the study site and elsewhere in Ethiopia. For example, other sources of energy such as hydropower, wind power, solar energy, and natural gas can potentially offer Ethiopia major economic development opportunity, thereby, reducing poverty and environmental degradation.|$|R
30|$|Manure {{is derived}} from herbivorous animals and is {{predominantly}} the metabolic remnants of living tissue {{and parts of the}} food that was not digested like cellulose and lignin, and thus, the <b>cow’s</b> <b>dung</b> components are fiber or cellulose in nature. This material has a considerable drawback in that it lacks pockets (spaces) to hold the water. This study exploited this abundant and pulverized form of starch material from the cow-dung manure {{to improve the quality of}} the product by synthesizing a novel manure gel through modification. In this study, different derivatives were successfully obtained by modification (cross linking) with urea, glycerol, and uric acid from chicken dung to form different manure gels separately (Zhou et al. 2011). Chicken dung is readily available and has a high content of uric acid.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{dispersal}} of seeds by cattle on fallows was assessed in a sudanian region of West Africa. All the feces {{were collected in}} four stands during two years from March 1994 to May 1996 and seeds were manually extracted. <b>Cow</b> <b>dungs</b> represent {{the main part of}} ail the feces collected. They were found on fallows mainly during the dry season when the cultivated area is open to cattle grazing. Cattle disperse weeds and some woody species that are in majority leguminous. Species diversity in dung is low and only some species such as Borreria stachydea, a weed, or Gardenia erubescens, a shrub, constitute the greater part of the seeds dispersed by cattle. Seed content of dung varies along the year; it is high from November to March and low in October, April and May and during the wet season. Weeds are dispersed by cattle during the whole dry season but are especially abundant from December to February when woody species arc mainly dispersed from January to March. Cattle acts principally as a disperser of species that colonize open habitat and {{play a role in the}} successions of vegetation that occur during the fallow-cultivation cycle...|$|R

Each ash is associated with a form of Shiva, a mahabhuta (classical element), a Power (Kala), a <b>cow</b> and her <b>dung.</b> The form of Shiva is described to create an element from his face.

25|$|Vectors may be {{mechanical}} or biological. A mechanical vector {{picks up}} an infectious agent {{on the outside}} of its body and transmits it in a passive manner. An example of a mechanical vector is a housefly, which lands on <b>cow</b> <b>dung,</b> contaminating its appendages with bacteria from the feces, and then lands on food prior to consumption. The pathogen never enters the body of the fly. In contrast, biological vectors harbor pathogens within their bodies and deliver pathogens to new hosts in an active manner, usually a bite. Biological vectors are often responsible for serious blood-borne diseases, such as malaria, viral encephalitis, Chagas disease, Lyme disease and African sleeping sickness. Biological vectors are usually, though not exclusively, arthropods, such as mosquitoes, ticks, fleas and lice. Vectors are often required in the life cycle of a pathogen. A common strategy used to control vector borne infectious diseases is to interrupt the life cycle of a pathogen by killing the vector.|$|E
