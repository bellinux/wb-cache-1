40|$|M. Ing. 3 CR 12 is <b>corrosion-resisting</b> <b>steel</b> {{containing}} 12 % chrome. The corrosion-resisting {{characteristics of}} 3 CR 12 are between those of carbon steel and existing stainless steels. Since the material properties of 3 CR 12 differ from carbon steel, the current SABS {{code of practice}} cannot be utilized {{in the design of}} hot-rolled components. A numerical investigation into the effect of gradual yielding material behaviour on the buckling strength of 3 CR 12 columns is presented. The columns under investigation was hot-rolled channel (152 x 76 x 18) sections. The influence of material and geometric non-linearities were investigated numerically. The effect of residual stresses was also investigated. Material data for the Finite Element Model was obtained experimentally via compression tests. The magnitude and distribution of the residual stresses were obtained experimentally by using the sectioning method. The results obtained from the Finite Element Analysis are compared to the buckling load predictions of the South African Code of Practice (SABS 0162 - 1 : 1993). Conclusions are made regarding the applicability to hot-rolled 3 CR 12 sections...|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. During all {{manufacturing}} processes {{it is crucial}} to use certain design criteria and guidelines. Special care should be exercised when the final product of a manufacturing process is used in the automotive industry, because the failure of such a component may have tragic consequences. The failure of a bus chassis in the public transport sector {{is an example of a}} case where the failure of a product can have serious consequences. In recent years it has become common practice to use <b>corrosion-resisting</b> <b>steel</b> in the manufacture of these vehicles. The reason for this is the corrosion caused by a prolonged service life and adverse conditions such as salted road surfaces (The salt is used to melt the ice that forms on roads, particularly in European countries). These bus structures consist of tubes of varying size and geometry, and the manufacturing process of these tubes is considered in the present investigation. In a tube manufacturing process the design criteria may consist of such properties as the tube size and geometry, the thickness of the sheet that is used and the radius of the corners of the tube. Design criterion is also dependent upon the material that is used. The change in mechanical properties of the material during a manufacturing process is an important consideration during the establishment of design guidelines. The purpose of this investigation is to study the effects of particularly the cold forming manufacturing process on the mechanical properties of the material. The material used is 3 CR 12 corrosion resisting steel, a proprietary alloy also known as Type 1. 4003, that was developed by Columbus joint venture as a cheaper alternative to stainless steels. 3 CR 12 is not a substitute for stainless steel but it is an alternative to treated mild steel, providing a cost-effective solution to corrosion. An experimental investigation is conducted into the forming of 40 mm 3 CR 12 square tubes and normal plate bending of 3 CR 12. Various different wall thicknesses and bend radiuses are considered. A numerical investigation consisted of simulating the above-mentioned {{manufacturing processes}} using non-linear finite element analysis and then comparing its results to the experimental investigation. The experimental investigation showed that substantial work hardening occurred in the corner regions of the tube during forming. A loss of up to 70 % of 3 CR 12 's ductility may result in the corner regions. The work hardening at the inside of the tube was found to be higher than at the outside. A region of very little work hardening near the middle of the tube wall thickness was also identified (neutral axis). This neutral axis also seems to shift slightly more to the inside of the tube with thicker wall sections. The numerical analysis confirmed the experimental observations. An excellent correlation between the experimental and numerical results was achieved...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} were {{suggested}} the schemes of anode processes, {{taking into account the}} nature of metals, anion structure, pH solution of electrolyte and anode potential by electropulse polishing of corrosion- resisting and structural carbon steels. It is shown and experimentally confirmed, that under conditions of electropulse polishing of anode dissolving of metals, which are contained into corrosion-resisting and structural carbon steels, carried out according to mechanism of complex formation through a set of series and series-parallel of intermediate stages. In the 1 st stage on the surface of metals adsorption complexes with participation of chemisorption molecules of water are formed. In the next stages anions of electrolyte’s solution and molecules of water take part. In final stage of dissolving on the surface of anode soluble compounds are formed, which by transition into solution into simple ions are dissociated.  It is determined that by electrical-impulse polishing in dissolving of components of <b>corrosion-resisting</b> carbon <b>steels</b> the important role play chemical processes, and anode dissolving of metals take place in the field of mixed electrochemical and diffusion kinetics. Diffusion limitations appear as a result of difficult ion mass transfer through surface salt, oxide and hydro-oxide and absorption-phase coatings. </p...|$|R
