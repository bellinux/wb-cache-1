50|$|Most London Underground {{stations}} have “countdown” displays on each platform.

5000|$|... 2007 saw fresh {{controversy}} about the NFL Network. That year, the network happened {{to hold the}} rights to some match-ups with major implications. The first came in late November when one-loss Dallas hosted one-loss Green Bay. Green Bay's Brett Favre was also {{having one of the}} best seasons of his career and would eventually lead the resurgent Packers to the NFC Championship Game. Most fans could not see the game because of <b>carriage</b> <b>restrictions,</b> more noticeable because it involved nationally respected teams in a highly anticipated match-up. This controversy would pale in comparison to the final game the NFL Network would broadcast that season.|$|E

50|$|Artemether is a {{methyl ether}} {{derivative}} of dihydroartemesinin. It {{is similar to}} artemesinin in mode of action but demonstrates a reduced ability as a hypnozoiticidal compound, instead acting more significantly to decrease gametocyte <b>carriage.</b> Similar <b>restrictions</b> are in place, as with artemesinin, to prevent the development of resistance, therefore it is only used in combination therapy for severe acute cases of drug-resistant P. falciparum. It should be administered in a 7 day course with 4 mg/kg given per day for 3 days, followed by 1.6 mg/kg for 3 days. Side effects of the drug are few but include potential neurotoxicity developing if high doses are given.|$|R
40|$|Purpose Torso loads {{restrict}} chest-wall {{movement and}} ventilation, particularly during heavy exercise. Therefore, the differential impact of load <b>carriage</b> and chest-wall <b>restriction</b> was investigated during progressive treadmill exercise. In addition, acceptable work durations were derived {{across a wide}} range of submaximal, loaded exercise intensities. Methods Twelve males participated in two research phases. Phase 1 : Three incremental treadmill tests until exhaustion [control (clothing only), load carriage (clothing plus 22 -kg vest), and clothing with chest strapping]. Phase 2 : Five steady-state exercise trials (clothing plus 22 -kg vest) at intensities from 30 to 80...|$|R
40|$|Background: In 2002 / 03 the Queensland Government {{responded to}} {{high rates of}} alcohol-related harm in {{discrete}} Indigenous communities by implementing alcohol management plans (AMPs), designed to include supply and harm reduction and treatment measures. Tighter alcohol supply and <b>carriage</b> <b>restrictions</b> followed in 2008 following indications of reductions in violence and injury. Despite the plans being in place for over a decade, no comprehensive independent review has assessed to what level the designed aims were achieved and what effect the plans have had on Indigenous community residents and service providers.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between deregulation in the trucking industry and highway safety {{is an important}} economic and social issue. Analyses thus far have concentrated on the {{relationship between}} the downward pressure imposed on freight rates by deregulation and total safety investment by firms. Two issues which have been ignored are the effects that deregulation had on route <b>carriage</b> <b>restrictions</b> and total firm mileage. We show that the inclusion of these factors yields a model in which the relationship between motor carrier deregulation and highway safety is dependent upon the relative effects of all three factors. Estimation of the model using accident data implies that trucking deregulation did not deteriorate highway safety and may have actually improved it...|$|E

Tighter alcohol supply and <b>carriage</b> <b>restrictions</b> followed in 2008 following indications of reductions in violence and injury.

This study will describe the long-term impacts on important health, economic and social outcomes of Queensland’s AMPs. Methods/Design: The project has two main studies, 1) outcome evaluation using de-identified epidemiological data on injury, violence and other health and social indicators for across Queensland, including de-identified databases compiled from relevant routinely-available administrative data sets, and 2) a process evaluation to map the nature, timing and content of intervention components targeting alcohol. Process evaluation will {{also be used to}} assess the fidelity with which the designed intervention components have been implemented, their uptake and community responses to them and their perceived impacts on alcohol supply and consumption, injury, violence and community health. Interviews and focus groups with Indigenous residents and service providers will be used. The study will be conducted in all 24 of Queensland’s Indigenous communities affected by alcohol management plans. Discussion: This evaluation will report on the impacts of the original aims for AMPs, what impact they have had on Indigenous residents and service providers. A central outcome will be the establishment of relevant databases describing the parameters of the changes seen. This will permit comprehensive and rigorous surveillance systems to be put in place and provided to communities empowering them with the best credible evidence to judge future policy and program requirements for themselves. The project will inform impending alcohol policy and program adjustments in Queensland and other Australian jurisdictions. The project has been approved by the James Cook University Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number H 4967 & H 5241) ...|$|E

50|$|When the Tramways Act 1870 became law, the {{neighbouring}} councils of Manchester and Salford entered into negotiations for {{the provision of}} a tramway connecting the two towns. In 1875 powers were granted for construction to begin and, on Friday 18 May 1877 public services commenced. As the 1870 Act precluded operation of tramways by local authorities, the services were operated on behalf of the two town councils by the Manchester <b>Carriage</b> Company. This <b>restriction</b> was later removed by the 1886 Tramways Act, and both authorities made plans to seek powers to operate the tramways themselves. The Manchester Carriage Company's lease of the Salford lines expired in 1898, but they were granted an extension so that the lease expired {{at the same time as}} that of neighbouring Manchester, on 27 April 1901.|$|R
40|$|Telecommunications {{infrastructure}} {{goes through}} technology-induced phases, and the regulatory regime follows. Telecom 1. 0, based on copper wires, was monopolistic in market structure {{and led to}} a Regulation 1. 0 with government ownership or control. Wireless long-distance and then mobile technologies enabled the opening of that system to one of multi-carrier provision, with Regulation 2. 0 stressing privatization, entry, liberalization, and competition. But now, fiber and high-capacity wireless are raising scale economies and network effects, leading to a more concentrated market. At the same time, the rapidly growing importance of infrastructure, coupled with periodic economic instabilities, increase the importance of upgrade investments. All this leads to the return for a larger role for the state in a Regulation 3. 0 which incorporates many elements (though using a different terminology) of the traditional regulatory system [...] universal service, common <b>carriage,</b> cross-subsidies, structural <b>restrictions,</b> industrial policy, even price and profit controls. At the same time, the growing role of telecommunications networks of carriers of mass media and entertainment content will also lead to increasing obligations on network providers to police their networks and assure the maintenance of various societal objectives tied to mass media. These are predictions, not recommendations. ICT Regulation Telecommunications Policy Telecommunications infrastructure Investment Internet...|$|R
