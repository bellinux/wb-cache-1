40|$|A key {{assumption}} of many allopatric speciation models is that evolution in peripheral or isolated populations is facilitated by drastic reductions in population size. Population bottlenecks {{are believed to}} lead to rapid changes in gene frequencies through genetic drift, to facilitate rapid emergence of novel phenotypes, and to enhance reproductive isolation via genetic revolutions. For such effects to occur, founding populations must be very small, and remain small for some time after founding. This assumption has, however, rarely been tested in nature. One approach is to exploit the polymorphism of the major histocompatibility complex (Mhc) to obtain information about the founding population.

40|$|Many {{insights}} into ecological and evolutionary processes {{have come from}} studies of island systems. Diversity, abundance, and movement of species are restricted on smaller islands, but these dynamics can become increasingly complex as island size increases. In recent decades urbanization and the human population on the Galápagos islands has increased rapidly, affecting wildlife in unknown ways. During 2005 and 2006, we sampled birds along a 4 -km transect extending northeast {{of the city of}} Puerto Ayora, Santa Cruz Island. This allowed us to collect data on the potential impacts of rapidly growing urban center on passerine bird diversity and abundance. We also documented movement patterns of the medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis), the most abundant species on the transect, with a mark/recapture protocol. Although Darwin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>finches</b> have been an influencial model for the last 150 years, little is known about their movements on larger islands. Avian species diversity did not vary significantly along a transect from a periurban area into more remote habitat. Avian abundance, however, was inversely correlated with distance from the urban center. This latter finding is consistent with a well-documented trend in urban ecology, in which periurban areas show higher abundance as compared to adjacent, less developed regions. We also found recapture/re-sight rates for G. fortis within years were 7...|$|R

40|$|An old {{conjecture}} {{states that}} among all simplices {{inscribed in the}} unit sphere the regular one has the maximal mean width. An equivalent formulation is that for any centered Gaussian vector (ξ_ 1, [...] .,ξ_n) satisfying Eξ_ 1 ^ 2 = [...] . = Eξ_n^ 2 = 1 one has E {ξ_ 1, [...] .,ξ_n}≤√(n/n- 1) E {η_ 1, [...] .,η_n}, where η_ 1,η_ 2, [...] ., are independent standard Gaussian variables. Using this probabilistic interpretation we derive an asymptotic version of the conjecture. We also show that the mean width of the regular simplex with 2 n vertices is remarkably close to the mean width of the regular crosspolytope with {{the same number of}} vertices. Interpreted probabilistically, our result states that 1 ≤ E {|η_ 1 |, [...] .,|η_n|}/ E {η_ 1, [...] .,η_ 2 n}≤{√(2 n/ 2 n- 1), 1 +C/n n}, where C> 0 is an absolute constant. We also compute the higher moments of the projection length W of the regular cube, simplex and crosspolytope onto a line with random direction, thus proving several formulas conjectured by <b>S.</b> <b>Finch.</b> Finally, we prove distributional limit theorems for the length of random projection as the dimension goes to ∞. In the case of the n-dimensional unit cube Q_n, we prove that W_Q_n - √(2 n/π) dn→∞⟶N(0, π- 3 /π), whereas for the simplex and the crosspolytope the limiting distributions are related to the Gumbel double exponential law...|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} vegetation structure used by 14 {{bird species}} during the 1998 and 1999 breeding seasons {{to determine what}} habitat features best accounted for habitat division and community organization in Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) woodlands of southwestern Wyoming. Habitat use was quantified by measuring 24 habitat variables in 461 bird-centered quadrats, each 0. 04 ha in size. Using discriminant function analysis, we differentiated between habitat used by 14 bird species along 3 habitat dimensions: (1) variation in shrub cover, overstory juniper cover, mature tree density, understory height, and decadent tree density; (2) a gradient composed of elevation and forb cover; and (3) variation in grass cover, tree height, seedling/sapling cover, and bare ground/rock cover. Of 14 species considered, 9 exhibited substantial habitat partitioning: Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura), Bewick 2 ̆ 7 s Wren (Thryomanes bewickii), Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea), Mountain Bluebird (Sialia currucoides), Plumbeous Vireo (Vireo plumbeus), Green-tailed Towhee (Pipilo chlorurus), Brewer 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow (Spizella breweri), Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis), and Cassin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Finch</b> (Carpodacus cassinii). Our results indicate juniper bird communities of southwestern Wyoming are organized along a 3 -dimensional habitat gradient composed of woodland maturity, elevation, and juniper recruitment.

40|$|Censuses of two 20 -acre plots {{in upper}} Logan Canyon, Utah, {{were made by}} the spot-mapping method during 1970 and 1971 to {{determine}} the differences in composition and density of breeding-bird populations in aspen stands of significantly different density and stature. The less dense stand of greater average d. b. h., average height and per cent ground cover had 20 breeding species totalling 615 pairs per 100 acres (expressed as equivalent territories). The more dense stand of smaller trees and brushy undergrowth had 14 breeding species with 267. 5 equivalent territories per 100 acres. Nine species were found on both areas. Observations of foraging height were made concurrently with recordings of time spent at various methods of feeding- ground, vi foliage, bark, hover, and hawking- for the birds of the more open stand. Comparison showed that more ground- and low bush-nesters were present on the dense, brushy stand whereas more cavity-nesters were found in the larger trees. Cavity excavation was limited to trees of greater d. b. h. and cavity-dependent birds were thus limited by nest-hole availability. The horizontal, heavy branch stubs preferred by pewees and tree swallows and the high perches and open areas of the olive-sided flycatcher were also limited to the less dense stand. Cassin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>finches</b> and pine siskins were not found in the dense stand which had fewer invading conifers and was farther from conifer stands.

Our efforts had yielded such birds as Bean Goose, Green-tailed Towhee, Black-necked Stilt, Red Phalarope, Lewis 2 ̆ 7 Woodpecker, Sprague 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Pipit, <b>Cassin</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Finch,</b> <b>Cassin</b> 2 ̆ 7 s Kingbird, and King Eider. When 1985 ended, my Nebraska life list stood at 290 and I had seen 237 species in the state for the year, without any real attempt to see migrant songbirds.... In summary, I found all of the 197 birds I had given a Code 1, and 53 of the 54 Code 2 species (missed Hermit Thrush). Of the 40 birds I had given a Code 3 I had found 26. Included in my total were 12 Code 4 birds and 3 Code 5 species. Each species counted in the total had at least one witness or was documented with a photograph....

40|$|This {{winter was}} {{generally}} unremarkable {{except for the}} occurrence of good numbers of several species at {{the western edge of}} the state, notably Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Nutcracker, Pygmy Nuthatch, and Bohemian Waxwing. There were a couple of sightings of Mountain Chickadee and one of Cassin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Finch</b> for good measure. All of the winter finches on the Nebraska list (except for Hoary Redpoll) appeared, most notably Pine Grosbeak, represented by two birds. One of these was in the southwest (Kansas had several reports) but the other was in the east, suggesting either multiple points of origin, or, as suggested by some in Kansas, northern rather than western origin. Also in good numbers were Red-breasted Nuthatches, but Harris 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrows were scarce. Black-capped Chickadees remained in very low numbers in southern Nebraska west of the Missouri River Valley. Of interest was the discovery of wintering Marsh and Winter Wrens along the central Niobrara Valley; perhaps this is a regular occurrence, but who 2 ̆ 7 s been looking? This phenomenon may be linked to other occurrences that would be expected in a warmer winter: several species of ducks that are generally not seen in midwinter were found on the Scottsbluff and Gering Sewage Lagoons, sapsuckers were in good numbers, catbirds and Brown Thrashers put in unexpected winter appearances, and a Loggerhead Shrike was far to the north.

40|$|Some {{of you may}} {{be curious}} about the sources of {{sightings}} I use to compile these reports. The primary sources are reports posted to NEBirds, the Nebraska Listserv, along with the full reports (early and late dates, peak counts for all species) sent by a few faithful reporters around the state. The latter reports are very useful overviews of movements in the reporters 2 ̆ 7 regions. Lately, thanks to a suggestion by Clem Klaphake, I have been receiving the eBird daily rarity report for Nebraska which I find to be an excellent check against reports posted to NEBirds, while providing a few additional reports of interest. As eBird becomes a major depository and source of data, how {{and to what extent}} these data can be utilized by seasonal reporters and state records committees is a topic under serious discussion. More on that as it unfolds. In these reports, I often cite 2 ̆ 2 early dates 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 late dates. 2 ̆ 2 These follow the style in Birds of Nebraska (Sharpe et al., 2001) and refer to the first or last set of accumulated dates that are within a few days of each other, preferably 3 or fewer, and so presumably define a sort of 2 ̆ 2 consensus 2 ̆ 2 arrival or departure date. Now to the birds. This was an interesting fall in several ways. Raptor enthusiasts were excited about Harris 2 ̆ 7 s Hawk and Crested Caracara reports, while nesting Mississippi Kites, Broad-winged Hawks, and Ospreys added interest. An amazing number of wood-warblers were found in the west, notably such rarities as Tennessee, Nashville, Magnolia, Bay-breasted, Chestnut-sided, and Blackburnian.

40|$|Background: Evidence for the {{efficacy}} of web-based treatments for depression has increased substantially the last few years. However, many of these programs obtain poor effect sizes or fail {{to become a part}} of routine practice. Such issues could be due to a knowledge gap on how these interventions should be implemented. Objective: The primary aim of this study is to examine what is known from the existing literature about implementation of internet interventions for depression. Method: A systematic scoping review of English and Scandinavian-language articles was carried out on 12 databases. Additional papers were identified by contacting relevant societies, as well as hand-searching journals and reference lists. Only empirical studies on internet-based interventions for depression were included. Relevant articles were subjected to a directed content analysis, using May and <b>Finch</b> <b>s</b> (2009) Normalization Process Theory (NPT) as a theoretical framework to identify implementation information. Results: 7 076 citations were identified and screened for relevance, resulting in 255 full-text articles on internet interventions for depression, of which 51 % were relevant to the implementation framework (N = 130). Content analysis revealed that there was a substantial lack of reporting on implementation. Furthermore, researchers tend to use a non-systematic approach when reporting on implementation and often fail to consider the different organizational levels involved in putting an intervention into practice. Conclusion: The review identified considerable knowledge gaps in the literature. These findings indicate that the field of internet interventions for depression require a great deal of research on implementation, especially in areas that relate to other levels than intervention users...|$|R

The present study aimed to detect and identify samples of Cryptosporidium spp. from free-living wild birds, in order to contribute to the knowledge of the variability of this parasite in the free-living population of Brazil. Stool samples were collected from 242 birds, with the following proportions of individuals: 50 Emberizidae (20. 7 %), 112 Psittacidae (46. 3 %), 44 Cardinalidae (18. 2 %), 12 Turdidae (5. 0 %), eight Ramphastidae (3. 3 %), seven Icteridae (2. 9 %), three Estrilididae (1. 2 %), two Contigidae (0. 8 %), two Thraupidae (0. 8 %) and two Fringilidae (0. 8 %).

Endoscopy, histopathological reports, case notes and blood tests were examined, and postcodes recorded. Records of pollen counts were obtained. Cases were defined according to esophageal biopsy and grouped based on month of diagnosis. All other causes of FBOE served as controls. Results: One thousand, one hundred and thirty-two FBOE were identified. Biopsies were only performed in 278 of these cases, and 85 patients were found to have EoE after biopsy. Patients with EoE were younger (mean age 38 years, range 18 – 72) compared with those with alternative diagnosis (mean age 64. 4 range 22 – 92), more likely to be male (M : F = 4 : 1 compared with 1. 68 : 1) and had a higher eosinophil count in venous blood. Overall no seasonality was demonstrated in FBOE secondary to any diagnosis, although the six cases of recurrent FBOE secondary to EoE mainly occurred in the grass pollen season in subsequent years. FBOE cases were evenly distributed throughout metropolitan Melbourne irrespective of population density. EoE as a percentage of FBOE increased over time. Conclusion: Seasonal aeroallergens may be important for a subgroup of patients with EoE presenting as recurrent FBOE. Esophageal biopsies are performed in a minority of patients, representing a significant departure from ideal management and contributing to recurrent unnecessary FBOE. EoE is an increasingly important cause of FBOE. H. L. Philpott, S. Nandurkar, F. Thien, S. Bloom, E. Lin, R. Goldberg, R. Boyapati, A. <b>Finch,</b> <b>S.</b> G. Royce and P. R. Gibso...|$|R
40|$|This was {{essentially}} a normal fall season in Nebraska, with no major weather events or significant shifts in breeding or migration ranges, although a possible exception is a first record of Lesser Goldfinch breeding in the state. One observer made the point, though, that the hard freeze in the spring affected seed and fruit crops for fall, most conspicuously resulting in fewer large American Robin flocks. Excellent water conditions in the Rainwater Basin were welcome, but few herons and egrets were present, and no unusual breeding events were reported there. As winter approached, however, increased numbers of a few finch species were noted. Most conspicuous was Purple Finch, which was reported statewide, unusual in the west, where it is normally rare. Other species showing well were Pine Siskin and Red-breasted Nuthatch (OK, it 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> not a <b>finch!)</b> Although Mountain Chickadee appeared in good numbers on the Colorado Plains, they were not much in evidence in Nebraska. A few species were found in notable numbers: scoters continued their upward trend of recent years, a flock of 30 - 35 Whooping Cranes must have spectacular, rather incredible flocks of Purple Martins went over Omaha, and 36 Nelson 2 ̆ 7 s Sharptailed Sparrows were counted at one location. Other items of interest were the several species of shorebirds lingering rather late, the slow recovery of Black-capped Chickadees, and proof of a late summer influx and breeding by Marsh Wren, a phenomenon previously attributed mainly to Sedge Wren. Two species appeared in the east unexpectedly: a Broad-tailed Hummingbird in Bellevue was a first for that species in eastern Nebraska while a MacGillivray 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler was photographed in Dodge Co. With a state list of 448, additions are tough to come by, but there were two this fall, an emaciated Royal Tern that generously decided to expire within the state boundaries, {{and at least one}} apparently all-dark frigatebird, unfortunately unidentifiable to species, but still the first documented frigatebird for the state. A pair of 5 th state records was provided by a Gray Flycatcher and a Black-throated Gray Warbler. And we would be remiss if we failed to note that the Curve-billed Thrasher in Sioux Co will celebrate his 5 th anniversary of residence there in October...|$|R
