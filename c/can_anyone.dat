Its purpose is also not simply because its {{observance}} is conducive to general welfare of the state or the community. While it is true that in Jainism, the moral and religious injunctions were laid down as law by Arhats who have achieved perfection through their supreme moral efforts, their adherence is just not to please a God, but the life of the Arhats has demonstrated that such commandments were conductive to Arhat's own welfare, helping him to reach spiritual victory.

500|$|It {{was said}} that they learned that those {{who had gone to}} treat with the King would have been fallen upon by armed men and slain... but that Nicholas Exton, the Mayor of London, having refused to countenance the evil, a deep and wicked plot was spread about and the scandal {{gradually}} uncovered.This event must, then, have occurred [...] "within days" [...] of Exton's election as Mayor. It was important, though, for the King to gain the backing of the City of London, and Exton, on his behalf, attempted to achieve this in October 1387 by requesting, unsuccessfully, that all the craft guilds would take an oath of loyalty to Richard. On the other hand, Knighton's Chronical suggests that although the King attempted to force the City to raise an army for royal use, Exton informed him that the inhabitants [...] "were in the main craftsmen and merchants, with no great military experience" [...] and that the only reason they could ever be raised in arms was to defend the city itself. Nevertheless, the King despatched a warrant for the arrest of the rebel lords, and it was the responsibility of Exton to execute it; however, says Jonathan Sumption, Exton [...] "quailed before such a task [...] resolved that the city had no business executing a warrant of this kind." [...] In December that year he authorised the opening of the city gates to the Lords Appellant (although only [...] "once their victory [...] had become certain"). Indeed, he may have actually greeted the lords outside the city gates and accompanied them back into London. Favent reports that the Duke of Gloucester, a leading Appellant, on hearing Exton's pledges of the city's loyalty, remarked [...] "Now I know in truth that liars tell nothing but lies, nor <b>can</b> <b>anyone</b> prevent them from being told." ...|$|E

This argument has led some to label Gorgias a nihilist (one who believes nothing exists, or that the world is incomprehensible, and that the concept of truth is fictitious).|$|E

2500|$|Jainism {{does not}} invoke fear of or reverence for God or {{conformity}} {{to the divine}} character {{as a reason for}} moral behaviour, and observance of the moral code is not necessary simply because it is God's will.

[...] All of them agreed that Gongsun Du would succeed if he did so. After Gongsun Du sought his opinion, Liang Mao replied, [...] "The Han Empire {{is in a state}} of chaos and on the brink of collapse. General, you command thousands of troops, yet you sit here and watch others attack and destroy each other. As a subject of the Han Empire, is this what you should be doing? Lord Cao is concerned about the Han Empire's future and the people's welfare, which is why he leads an army of righteousness to eliminate tyrants and villains. He has made immense contributions and his virtues are well-known. There is none other like him in the Han Empire. As peace and stability has just recently been restored, it is only a matter of time before everyone starts pointing fingers at you, General, for not doing anything to save the Han Empire. Now, General, you want to lead your forces west to attack Ye? All it takes is one morning to find out the result of this test of survival and destruction. General, I hope you know what is good for you." [...] Gongsun Du's subordinates were shocked when they heard what Liang Mao said.

2500|$|In {{the general}} election, the Democratic Party nominee was Terry Goddard, {{who had served}} as the mayor of Phoenix until February of that year. Goddard is also the son of former Arizona Governor Samuel Pearson Goddard Jr. During the campaign, Goddard had {{attempted}} to cast doubt on Symington {{in the minds of}} voters by stating that the former businessman could face indictment for his business activities. In response, Symington charged that Goddard had violated the state's campaign finance law by [...] "accepting a law-firm salary while campaigning, without spending the stipulated hours on legal work." [...] One of Symington's campaign promises included a state budget cut of 6%, except for programs related to education and the poor. On election day in November 1990, the presence of several write-in candidates resulted in Symington and Goddard being virtually tied, with Symington ahead by only 4,300 votes. Prior to the election, Arizona had adopted runoff voting in general elections if no candidate received 50% of the vote. This came after the controversial Evan Mecham had been elected governor in 1986 with only 40% of the vote. As a result, a runoff was scheduled for February 26, 1991. Both candidates spent a cumulative total of approximately $5 million in the primary, general and runoff campaigns. Shortly before the runoff occurred, while in Washington, D.C. for a fundraiser, Symington was called before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee by Democratic Senator Howard Metzenbaum, a move that was seen as politically motivated. During the hearing, U.S. Senator Bob Dole accused the Democrats of a political [...] "sneak attack" [...] on Symington, a line which was later used in a Symington campaign commercial. The commercial also depicted Goddard behind bars, as the ad's narrator asks: [...] "How <b>can</b> <b>anyone</b> trust Terry Goddard, when the fact is he's broken the law?" [...] Symington would go on to win the runoff with 52% of the vote. After the extended campaign, Arizona returned to plurality voting for all subsequent gubernatorial elections, making the 1990 gubernatorial election the only runoff election in Arizona's history.|$|E
