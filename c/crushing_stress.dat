40|$|Abstract—In {{the study}} of {{honeycomb}} crushing under quasistatic loading, two parameters are important, the mean <b>crushing</b> <b>stress</b> and the wavelength of the folding mode. The previous theoretical models did not consider the true cylindrical curvature effects and the flow stress in the folding mode of honeycomb material. The present paper introduces a modification on Wierzbicki’s model based on considering two above mentioned parameters in estimating the mean <b>crushing</b> <b>stress</b> and the wavelength through implementation of the energy method.

40|$|A {{challenge}} in numerical simulation of crashworthiness {{study is to}} be able to predict the crush damage modes, their evolution during crushing and the energy absorption in any composite structure from elementary material characterisation data. Therefore, it is important to know the behavior of one ply subjected to crushing load, and especially to determine the mean <b>crushing</b> <b>stress</b> that could be used for simulation. For that purpose, quasi-static crushing tests are performed for different configurations of two CFRP materials, UD and fabrics to determine the mean <b>crushing</b> <b>stress</b> of plies alone and inside a laminate. This study shows there is a linear relationship between crushing load and the contact surface of the plies being crushed on a metallic base which enables actually to define a mean <b>crushing</b> <b>stress</b> for a ply. The method to calculate this value is presented in this paper, based on image analysis of specific crushing tests. Experimental results show that for the UD material, the mean crushing stresses in 0 ° and 90 ° plies are very close. The value for a balanced fabric is also similar, approximately 270 MPa...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate four different material models in predicting the dynamic crushing response of solid-element-based models of a composite honeycomb energy absorber, designated the Deployable Energy Absorber (DEA). Dynamic crush tests of three DEA components were simulated using the nonlinear, explicit transient dynamic code, LS-DYNA. In addition, a full-scale crash test of an MD- 500 helicopter, retrofitted with DEA blocks, was simulated. The four material models used to represent the DEA included: *MAT_CRUSHABLE_FOAM (Mat 63), *MAT_HONEYCOMB (Mat 26), *MAT_SIMPLIFIED_RUBBER/FOAM (Mat 181), and *MAT_TRANSVERSELY_ANISOTROPIC_CRUSHABLE_FOAM (Mat 142). Test-analysis calibration metrics included simple percentage error comparisons of initial peak acceleration, sustained <b>crush</b> <b>stress,</b> and peak compaction acceleration of the DEA components.

Redwood {{is an excellent}} energy absorber, but only the most rudimentary information exists on its crush properties. The objectives {{of the study were}} to fill the information gap by collecting triaxial load-deformation data for redwood; to use these data to characterize redwood crush, assess current wood failure theories, provide developments toward a complete stress-strain theory for redwood; and to review the literature on strain-rate effects on redwood crush performance.

Crushing strength experiment was performed using Uniaxial Compression Machine. The data is plotted as <b>crushing</b> <b>stress</b> versus height, load versus time of failure and <b>crushing</b> <b>stress</b> versus thickness. Microstructures were also analyzed. Moisture content of bamboo was carried out to know the effect of moisture on the crushing strength. Results show that, increase in height reduces the strength of the bamboo and vice versa. Increase in moisture content increases the strength of the Bamboo. The height of the fresh bamboo decreases as the crushing load increases and the time of failure also increase. The effect of thickness does not depend on only the <b>crushing</b> <b>stress</b> but also the amount of moisture in the bamboo. The crushing stresses for a height of 250, 210, 170, 130, and 90 mm were 51. 3093, 71. 1447, 74. 5867, 79. 5905 and 85. 2036 MPa, respectively.

Since this phenomenon can threaten structural barriers as well as major components, extensive integrity assessment research is necessary to ensure their safety.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} {{deformation}} behavior of reinforced fresh bamboo subjected to static-compressive loading condition. Crushing strength test was performed using Uniaxial Compression Machine with maximum loading capacity of 1500 kN. The data is plotted as {{strength to weight}} ratio versus height, strength to volume ratio versus height, failure stress versus height, load versus time of failure and load to height ratio versus time of failure. Result shows that increase in height of the fresh reinforced bamboo increases the strength and vice versa. The moisture content also has significant influence {{on the strength of}} the fresh reinforced bamboo. The moisture content reduced the strength of the fresh reinforced bamboo by 21. 8 %. This percentage is really significant in structural analysis since it can cause catastrophic failure to structures. Concrete is significant in reinforcing bamboo structures for a better strength. The <b>crushing</b> <b>stresses</b> for fresh reinforced bamboo of heights 250, 210, 170, 130 and 90 mm were found to be 26. 09, 25. 52, 24. 85, 21. 97, 21. 86 MPa respectively. The failure stress of the bamboo is about say 1. 26 M times the weight of the bamboo per square meter. The specific compressive strength which explains the bending moment per kilogram of the bamboo specimen also increases with increases in height. Failure stress to weight ratio decreases with increases with the height of the bamboo. Strength to volume ratio also decreases with increases with the height from the bamboo...|$|R

40|$|A simple {{mathematical}} model for predicting the <b>crushing</b> <b>stress</b> of composite materials was derived and presented in this paper. The present knowledge of fracture mechanics and strength of materials are {{used as the basis}} for the model. The fracture mechanics part of the analysis was based on energy release rate approach; the energy release rate, G, of the proposed model was determined by this approach. This energy release rate was based on the Mode I (opening or tensile mode) failure. As for the strength of materials part analysis, buckling theory was used to determine the critical load of the fibre beams. These two engineering concepts were combined to form the equation for the proposed model. The derived equation is a function of the materials properties, geometric and physical parameters of the composite materials. The calculated stresses from the derived equation were compared with experimental data from technical and research papers. Good agreements shown in the results are encouraging and recommendations for future analysis with different modes of failure were also presented.

40|$|Cellular {{material}} such as aluminium foam {{has been}} considered as a potential material for energy absorption upon impact and blast loadings. One {{of the most important}} properties that contribute to this feature is the densification strain. At high impact velocity, prediction of the densification strain from quasi-static engineering stress-strain curve has been found inadequate. Furthermore, theoretical prediction using the equation proposed by Reid et al. always over-predicts the dynamic <b>crushing</b> <b>stress.</b> Formation of the shock wave at high impact velocity is believed to further increase the densification level of the foam. However, this effect is disregarded when determining the densification strain quasi-statically. The present study aims to address this issue by determining the densification strain experimentally from impact tests. Forty cylindrical aluminium foams with three different lengths were used as projectiles and were fired towards a rigid load cell by using a gas gun. The peak forces generated from the impact were recorded and analysed. The experimental densification strains were determined physically by measuring the deformation of the foam projectiles after the tests. It is concluded that, at high impact velocity, the densification strain varies with the initial impact velocity. Therefore an appropriate value of densification strain needs {{to be used in the}} equation of dynamic <b>crushing</b> <b>stress</b> for a better approximation...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} cell size on the {{out of plane}} {{compressive}} crushing response of circular cell polycarbonate honeycomb is presented. The results are a continuation of a study originally done by Mellquist and Waas, 2002. Experiments were conducted on hexagonal cell honeycombs {{ranging in size from}} 1 to 14 cells. The results show that no scaling factor can be determined for the crushing load based on sample size, but that stability appears to be a driving property. Specimen cross-section shapes that have an arrangement of cells with higher orders of symmetry provide greater stability and are less imperfection sensitive and therefore have higher crushing loads. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to better understand the behavior of the honeycombs during crushing and to validate experimental results. An FEA model developed during the previous work (a 7 cell model) has been expanded to multiple sizes. The results are presented and show that the model can accurately predict how different size honeycombs will perform under crushing loads.

40|$|The human retina is a {{thin layer}} of tissue on the inner back wall of the eye, {{containing}} millions of photoreceptor cells that receive and combine visual information. The retina sends visual information to the superior colliculus of the brain through the optic nerve. Because the retina ranks as one of the highest energy-consuming systems in the body, it requires a constant and abundant oxygen supply from the blood. Therefore, the retina is relatively susceptible to damage induced by oxidative stressors. Excessive oxidative stress is a key contributing factor in the pathophysiology of retinal disorders such as age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and retinopathy, which can lead to visual loss or complete blindness. Clinical {{studies have shown that the}} progression of retinal diseases can be slowed down by dietary treatment with antioxidant compounds such as vitamins, carotenoids, zinc, and phenolic phytochemicals. Coffee is one of the most frequently consumed beverages worldwide and its popularity continues to increase. Although coffee is rich in phenolic compounds and is the main contributor of dietary antioxidant intake in the diet, its protective effect against retinal degeneration has never been studied. In these studies, we employed several approaches to examine the protective effect of phenolic compounds in coffee on the retina. Specifically, the studies presented here investigated (i) the effects of coffee extracts and chlorogenic acid, a major phenolic compound in coffee, on retinal degeneration and (ii) the effects of phenolic acid metabolites formed after coffee consumption on retinal degeneration. The results showed that chlorogenic acid and coffee extracts could significantly reduce the apoptosis induced by hypoxia or optic nerve <b>crush</b> <b>stress</b> in the retina. In addition, coffee metabolites, especially chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and dihydrocaffeic acid, could reach the eye and protect the retina against hypoxia and optic nerve crush in vivo. Moreover, we show that extracts of Indian gooseberry, which is widely consumed in Asia as an ingredient in traditional medicine, juice, and cosmetics, has a retinal protective effect against amyloid beta-induced neuronal degeneration. Collectively, these findings suggest that coffee and Indian gooseberry consumption may help to prevent retinal degeneration. 2020 - 05 - 2...|$|R

40|$|Cellular {{materials}} {{are often used}} as impact/blast attenuators due to their capacity to absorb kinetic energy when compressed to large strains. For such applications, three key material properties are the <b>crushing</b> <b>stress,</b> plateau stress and densification strain. The difficulties associated with obtaining these mechanical properties from dynamic/impact tests are outlined. The results of an experimental investigation of the quasi-static and dynamic mechanical properties of two types of cellular {{materials are}} reported. The dynamic tests were carried out using Hopkinson pressure bars. Experimentally determined propagation coefficients are employed to represent both dispersion and attenuation effects as stress waves travel along the bars. Propagation coefficients were determined for 20 mm and 40 mm diameter viscoelastic PMMA pressure bars and for elastic Magnesium pressure bars. The use of the elementary wave theory is shown to give satisfactory results for frequencies of up to approximately 15 kHz, 8 kHz and 30 kHz for the 20 mm and 40 mm diameter PMMA bars and the 23 mm diameter Magnesium bars respectively. The use of low impedance, viscoelastic pressure bars is shown to be preferable for testing low density, low strength materials. The quasi-static and dynamic compressive properties of balsa wood, Rohacell- 51 WF and Rohacell- 110 WF foams are investigated along all three principal directions. The dynamic properties were investigated by performing Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) and Direct Impact (DI) tests. In general, the <b>crushing</b> <b>stress,</b> the plateau stress and the densification strain remain constant with increasing strain rate of the SHPB tests. However, a dynamic enhancement of the <b>crushing</b> <b>stress</b> and plateau stress was revealed for balsa wood and Rohacell- 51 WF. In contrast, the plateau stresses of the Rohacell- 110 WF specimens are lower for SHPB than quasi-static tests. From the DI tests, it is shown that compaction waves have negligible effect on the stresses during dynamic compaction of along and across the grain balsa wood at impact speeds between approximately 20 - 100 m/s. Alternatively, the proximal end stresses of both Rohacell- 51 WF and 110 WF foams increase with increasing impact velocity, following the quadratic trend predicted by 'shock theory'. This indicates that compaction waves are important for the case of Rohacell foam, even at low impact velocities. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} comprehensive {{investigations into}} the mechanical behaviour of freeze dried (FD) biopharmaceuticals with respect to processing conditions (freezing rate, mode of ice nucleation and primary drying temperature). The contribution of formulation composition, cake density and individual excipients on the mechanical properties were studied. The interactive effect of processing conditions and model formulation composition was also studied using statistically designed experiments. A mechanical indentation test using a flat faced punch was developed and validated to test fragile freeze-dried cakes in-situ (within vial) without any sample preparation. FD cakes were made from sucrose, trehalose, mannitol and model formulations with lysozyme and bovine serum albumin (BSA) under typical industrial FD process conditions. 	Freeze-dried cakes exhibited failure by a brittle crushing mechanism. An initial near linear rise in the stress-strain curve represented cake elastic behaviour and transitioned into a steady stress plateau as strain was increased, with intermittent cracking and crushing failures representative of cells failures in the z axial direction. 	FD trehalose, sucrose and mannitol have distinctly different Young’s modulus and maximum stresses at failure. Higher primary drying temperature (- 40 °C) causes cell micro-collapse hence reduces the Young’s modulus and <b>crushing</b> <b>stress</b> compared to - 50 °C. Cakes manufactured at faster cooling rates (0. 9 °C/min) produce smaller pore sizes but more in number resulting in higher Young’s modulus and <b>crushing</b> <b>stress</b> compared to slower cooling rates of 0. 09 °C/min with less numerically but larger pore sizes. Controlled nucleation creates a narrow pore size distribution resulting in a uniform Young’s modulus and similar <b>crushing</b> <b>stress</b> compared to cakes with wider pore size distributions (spontaneous nucleation). FD lysozyme and BSA products cakes are strongest when mannitol and sucrose are used in combination at 1 : 1 ratio compared to other formulation compositions. 	In summary, the findings offer a systematic {{understanding of the relationship}} of mechanical behaviour of FD cakes, processing conditions and formulation composition. The mechanical test method developed can potentially provide a quantitative critical quality attribute related to internal FD cake structure hence its robustness for handling and transportation. It will provide information on suitability of biopharmaceutical formulations including excipients for manufacture of robust FD cakes. Open Acces...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{considered}} {{the design of}} new and improved foldcore sandwich panels suitable for high-performance energy absorption applications. This was achieved by utilising origami geometry design techniques to alter foldcore structures such that they possessed different mechanical behaviours and failure modes. The major findings of this thesis were in three areas as follows. First, a modified planar foldcore geometry was developed by introducing sub-folds into a standard foldcore pattern. The new geometry, deemed the indented foldcore, successfully triggered a high-order failure mode known as a travelling hinge line failure mode. This {{was found to have}} a much higher energy absorption than the plate buckling failure mode seen in an unmodified foldcore structure. A comprehensive numerical, theoretical, and experimental analysis was conducted on the indented core, which included {{the development of a new}} foldcore prototyping method that utilised 3 D printed moulds. It was shown that compared to available commercial honeycomb cores, the indented foldcore had an improved uniformity of energy absorption, but weaker overall peak and <b>crushing</b> <b>stresses.</b> Second, rigid origami design principles were used to develop extended foldcore geometries. New parametrisations were presented for three patterns, to complete a set of Miura-derivative geometries termed first-level derivatives. The first-level derivative parametrisations were then combined to create complex, piecewise geometries, with compatible faceted sandwich face geometry also developed. Finally, a method to generate rigid-foldable, curved-crease geometry from Miura-derivative straight-crease geometry was presented. All geometry was validated with physical prototypes and was compiled into a MATLAB Toolbox. Third, the performance of these extended foldcore geometries under impact loadings was investigated. An investigation of curved-crease foldcores showed that they were stronger than straight-crease foldcores, and at certain configurations can potentially match the strength, energy-absorption under quasi-static impact loads, and out-of-plane stiffness of a honeycomb core. A brief investigation of foldcores under low-velocity impact loadings showed that curved-crease foldcores, unlike straight-crease foldcores, strengthened under dynamic loadings, however not to the same extent as honeycomb. Finally, an investigation of single-curved foldcore sandwich shells was conducted. It was seen that foldcore shells could not match the energy-absorption capability of an over-expanded honeycomb shell, but certain core types did exhibit other attributes that might be exploitable with future research, including superior initial strength and superior uniformity of response.

40|$|Achieving zonal {{isolation}} by cementing annulus {{space between}} casing and well bore {{is an important}} job in many oil wells. Gas leakage in the annulus has been recognised as a major completion problem in the oil well. A successful cement job results in complete zonal isolation on a permanent basis. To achieve these goals, {{various factors such as}} well security, casing centralization, effective mud removal, and gas migration must be considered in the design. The design of the cement must be such that it prevents micro-annuli formation, stress cracking, corrosive fluid invasion, fluid migration, and annular gas pressure. However, permanent solutions to gas leakage has not emerged and gas leaks during and after the cement is set. In this thesis work attempt has been made to deal the fluid leakage behind casing in two levels, firstly, revealed gas migration mechanism and, secondly, analytical modeling of cement sheath failure by internal and rising temperature. Several theories have been proposed regarding gas migration. In chaper 2 some probable physio-mechanical phenomena responsible for fluid migration in the cemented casing have been described. During cement setting and hardening gas migration is attributed to ineffective hydrostatic head, fluid loss during cementing, and the differential pressure occurrence due to the gelation. Micro annulus is attributed to the cement inability to form a good bond with the casing. Cyclic pressure and temperature variations during production also lead to the debonding or tensile failure or <b>stress</b> <b>crushing</b> of the cement causing gas migration. Gas leakage may occur years after production has ceased and well has been plugged and abandoned (P&A). Explanatory mechanism includes channeling, poor mud removal, shrinkage, and high cement permeability. In chapter 3 efforts have been made to describe the case studies regarding zonal isolation. Case 1 describes the specialized cement design and placement procedures to mitigate casing vent flows (type: improve plan to avoid problem). Case 2 depicts a new cementing approach to improve and provide long term zonal isolation. Case 3 is related {{to the development of a}} methodology to evaluate the gas migration in cement slurries (type: predicting problem before it arises). The stress in the cement is strongly connected with temperature and pressure, as well as lithology and in-situ stress. In chapter 4 an attempt has been made to quantify the cement failure as a function of down hole conditions and geometry and to define optimum mechanical properties to sustain the induced stresses. Analytical modeling has been done on the basis of plane strain in thin wall condition. Expressions for total stresses (hoop stress in casing, hoop stress in cement, and far field stress) are used to analyzed the cement integrity based on the case study well parameters of the Kristin Oil Field of Norway, Well R- 3 H (chapter 5). As this oil field is HTHP type, conventional cement is found not withstanding the stresses. In most of the situation tensile failure is the mode of failure, in some cases <b>stress</b> <b>crushing</b> and debonding. Improving the elasticity of cement or it’s flexural and tensile strength appeared to be an elegant solution to prevent cement failure (debonding, radial craking, and <b>stress</b> <b>crushing).</b> In addition, improvement can be made using high grade casing pipe (high Young’s modulus, low Poisson’s ratio). In reality a thick wall high grade (Q- 125, SM- 125) casing program has been selected in the Kristin Oil Field. The results of this study show the relevant dependency of stress principles with differential well temperature, pressure and field stress, Young’s modulus, thickness, and diameter of casing and cement sheath are also important. </p...|$|R
40|$|Truncated cones made of {{composite}} materials, {{intended for}} structural {{applications in the}} automotive industry, have been studied {{from the point of}} view of their energy absorption capability when submitted to axial loading. The study has been developed at first applying quasi-static loads and then dynamic impact ones. The material used for this research is a fabric prepreg obtained by high-strength carbon fibers embedded in an epoxy resin. Three different geometrical parameters of the cones have been considered: the wall thickness (3 different values), the cone angle (3 different values) and the minor internal diameter (3 different values) and a total amount of 25 tests have been performed for each loading conditions. Results are shown in terms of loaddisplacement and current crushing stress-displacement diagrams; characteristic trends are compared and discussed. Finally SEA and average <b>crushing</b> <b>stress</b> are analyzed and their dependency on the above mentioned geometrical parameters are evaluated...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Quasi-static {{compressive}} {{tests were}} performed on carbon fiber rein-forced polymer (CFRP) circular tubes to examine their axial crushing behaviors. Stable progressive crushing processes with brittle fracturing crushing mode were observed during the experiments. It is found that the crushing triggers including the ply drop off trigger and the shape memory alloy (SMA) trigger introduced in the specimens can efficiently initiate a stable progressive crushing process and sig-nificantly improve the specific energy absorption (SEA) {{as well as the}} crushing load efficiency (CLE) of the specimens. It is important to mention that the SMA trigger provides 37. 2 % increase of the SEA and 28. 0 % increase of the CLE, respectively, as compared with the specimens without a crushing trigger. Moreover, the SEA and the CLE of the composite tubes with the SMA trigger are 22. 8 % and 4. 3 % higher than those of specimens with the ply drop off trigger. In addition, the significant improve-ment of the SEA and the CLE is achieved with only a little increase of the initial peak-specific <b>crushing</b> <b>stress...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to characterise the postharvest quality attributes of 'Buoi' mangoes by: (1) providing a detailed {{review of the literature}} on postharvest handling and storage of mangoes; (2) studying the effects of harvest date, storage temperature, length of storage, and postharvest treatments on postharvest quality of 'Buoi' mangoes; and (3) developing regression models for predicting postharvest quality attributes of 'Buoi' mango fruit as a function of storage temperature and length of storage. A review of the literature showed that considerable research has been carried out during the last 20 years on several aspects of postharvest handling and storage of mangoes. The literature review included maturity assessment, ripening behaviour of mangoes at low temperature storage, and postharvest treatments for controlling diseases and disorders. Many researchers have recommended storage conditions and postharvest treatments for various mango cultivars such as 'Alphonso', 'Carabao', 'Kensington', 'Haden', 'Keitt', 'Kent' etc., however, there was a dearth of information on the storage requirements for the important cultivars grown in Vietnam. Samples of 'Buoi' mango grown in Hoa Loc area, Cai Be District, Tien Giang Province (latitude: 10 ° 5 ', longitude: 102 °), Vietnam, were harvested at commercial maturity on three harvest dates based on uniform peel colour and morphological characteristics such as size and shape and transferred to laboratory at the Postharvest Technology Institute (PHTI) in Hochiminh city. To study the effects of harvest date on mango quality, fruit samples from the three harvests were stored at 12 ± 1 °C (RH 85 - 90 %) for 25 days. At 5 -day intervals, sub-samples were randomly removed from cold storage and assessed for weight loss, peel and pulp colour, soluble solids content (SSC), total acidity, flesh firmness and <b>crushing</b> <b>stress,</b> chilling injury (CI) and eating quality. Another sub-sample was assessed after 4 days ripening at 25 °C. The results showed that increasing storage time led to a significant (P < 0. 05) increase in weight loss, peel and pulp colour development, and incidence of chilling injury. However, both fresh firmness and <b>crushing</b> <b>stress,</b> and total acidity declined during storage. Soluble solids content and eating quality increased up to around 20 days, but declined afterwards. Harvest date influenced weight loss. CI and fruit texture (both firmness and <b>crushing</b> <b>stress),</b> but did not affect peel and pulp colour, SSC, total acidity, and eating quality. Early harvested fruit lost more weight compared with the mid- and late harvested fruit. However, there was no significantly difference in weight loss between mid- and late harvested fruit. Up to 10 days storage, fruit texture in early harvested fruit was significant higher than in mid- and late harvested fruit, but after this period the difference disappeared. Early harvested fruit were more susceptible to CI than mid- and late harvested fruit. Compared to fruit kept in cold storage, fruit ripened at 25 °C had higher SSC but were lower in total acidity. In addition, ripening fruit at 25 °C increased the severity of CI. To study the effects of storage temperature on mango quality, fruit samples from second harvest were stored at 7, 12, 17 ± 1 °C (RH 85 - 90 %), and room temperature (27 °C, RH 75 - 85 %) for 25 days. Storage temperature had a significant effect on fruit quality attributes. Increasing storage temperature led to increase in weight loss, and yellow colour development in peel and pulp tissue; however, firmness, <b>crushing</b> <b>stress,</b> total acidity and incidence of CI declined. In cold-stored fruit, soluble solids content and eating quality increased with increase in storage temperature. Storing fruit at 12 °C up to 20 days and 17 °C up to 15 days, respectively, maintained the quality and minimized the incidence of postharvest disorders in 'Buoi' mangoes. Regression models for predicting postharvest quality attributes of 'Buoi' mangoes as a function of storage temperature and storage time were developed, applicable for fruit storage in the range 7 – 27 °C up to 15 days and 7 – 17 °C up to 25 days. To assess the effect of hot water treatment (HWT) for controlling of postharvest diseases and disorders in 'Buoi' mango, fruit samples were randomly assigned to the following treatments prior to cold storage at 12 ± 1 °C (RH 85 - 90 %) : treatment 1 = fruit dipped in hot water at 52 °C for 5 min; treatment 2 = fruit dipped in hot water at 52 °C for 10 min; treatment 3 = fruit placed in PVC plastic bag; and treatment 4 = control (untreated) fruit. After 24 days storage, fruit were removed from cold storage and assessed for weight loss, peel and pulp colour, SSC, anthracnose, stem-end rot, shrivel and CI. HWT at 52 °C for 5 or 10 min significantly reduced the incidence of anthracnose, stem-end rot and CI compared to fruit in plastic bag or untreated fruit. Fruit in plastic bag lost less weight than the other treatments. HWT at 52 °C for 5 min was recommended for reducing the incidence of anthracnose, stem-end rot and CI in Vietnamese 'Buoi' mangoes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe energy {{absorption}} and load-bearing capacity under axial compression of some model cellular structures are studied {{with an eye}} toward optimization based on structural mass or volume available for deformation. Three configurations are considered: multilayer, multi-cell and multi-tube, all of a rectangular-cell topology. Loading is applied either parallel or normal to the cell axis. The cell’s aspect ratio and the relative density of the material ρ are systematically varied. The specimens are laterally confined by rigid walls to stabilize the deformation, but the effect of confinement diminishes for sufficiently large number of cells. A square-cell topology seems to be optimal. Together with an appropriate value for ρ, this provides an optimal constraint on the wavelength of the characteristic buckle and consequently extensive energy dissipation throughout the material body. When considering mean <b>stress,</b> <b>crush</b> energy and stroke or densification strain on the basis of minimum mass and volume simultaneously, ρ≈ 0. 5 seem to be a viable compromise among conflicting trends. The mechanical performance in this case is considerably improved over common cellular structures, for which ρ is typically < 0. 1...|$|R
40|$|Considering the {{difficulties}} associated with preparing loose sand samples in large calibration chambers and wide {{area of research}} on the behavior of loose sands, miniature calibration chamber experiments are used to perform cone penetration tests on soils in different states. A miniature cone calibration chamber has been designed and developed in this study. Nineteen tests have been performed on Ottawa sand and the results are compared to the available data in the literature. The accuracy of the results is validated by comparing the results with the suggested rate for the cone resistance in sands in literature. More specifically, results are compared with the results of the large calibration chamber tests performed on the same soil at University of Florida. Results are in a very good agreement with the literature and data available from large calibration chambers. Different soil identification systems are used to further validate and compare the results. Results of the performed tests are presented and discussed in terms of the repeatability of the developed apparatus, the effect of penetration rate, boundary condition effect, scale effect, particle <b>crushing,</b> overburden <b>stress</b> normalization and verification of the measurements. Some available procedures to perform a CPT-based liquefaction analysis including liquefaction susceptibility, triggering and post-liquefaction strength analysis are evaluated using the laboratory miniature CPT experiments performed in the current study. Some of the well-established equations to estimate soil properties required for liquefaction studies are also evaluated using the laboratory miniature CPT experiments performed in the current study. The existing methods for estimating state parameter from cone penetration test results are reviewed and an evaluation of the performance of the existing methods using the laboratory miniature CPT experiments performed in the current study is presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Living tree {{branches}} are {{almost impossible to}} snap. Some show ‘‘greenstick fracture’’, breaking halfway across before splitting along their length, while others simply buckle. In this study we investigated the bending failure of coppice branches of three temperate angiosperm trees: ash, Fraxinus excelsior; hazel, Corylus avellana; and white willow, Salix alba. We carried out bending tests, and {{made a series of}} observations on the structure, density and tensile and compressive strength of their wood to understand the pattern of failure. The three species showed contrasting behaviour; willow buckled whereas ash showed clean greenstick fracture and hazel a more diffuse greenstick fracture. These differences could be related to their wood properties. Willow buckled because its light wood had very low transverse compres-sive strength, particularly tangentially and was <b>crushed</b> by transverse <b>stresses.</b> Though the other species yielded in longitudinal compression on the concave side, they ulti-mately failed in tension on the convex side when bent because their higher density wood resisted transverse compression better. However, the crack was diverted down the midline because of the low tangential tensile strength of their wood. Differences in fracture between ash and hazel are related to fine-scale differences in their wood anatomy and mechanics...|$|R
