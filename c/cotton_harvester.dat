40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an image detection algorithm for navigation route of <b>cotton</b> <b>harvester.</b> Two cameras were respectively {{installed on the}} leftmost and rightmost picker unit, and images were captured during working process respectively. Firstly, the color characteristics among harvested field, un-harvested field, outside-field {{and the end of}} field were analyzed, then the target features of different fields was extracted using the color difference 3 B-R-G. Secondly, candidate point group was determined by looking for the critical point of peak from the lowest trough point to un-harvested field and associating with the detection result of the anterior frame. Lastly, navigation line was obtained by using passing a Known Point Hough Transform (PKPHT). Results show that the navigation line detected using this algorithm can fit the boundary line and the edge of field accurately, the average processing time is 56. 10 ms/f, and the algorithm can meet the actual production needs of <b>cotton</b> <b>harvester...</b>|$|E

The purpose of the work: to {{determine}} the laws of variation of the pulsing jet aerodynamic characteristics and its interaction with the cotton pods. The variations of the field speeds of the pulsing boundary layer in the initial and in the main areas, and the coefficient of the applied aerodynamic force of the cotton pod have been determined. The empiric formulae {{for the design of}} the aerodynamic characteristics of the pulsing jet and flowing over of the cotton pod have been deduced. The methods of design of the <b>cotton</b> <b>harvester</b> parameters have been developed for performing the design works.

40|$|New cotton {{harvesters}} {{have been}} introduced that have higher performance rate as well as eliminate extra labor and accompanying equipment. The new machines build partial modules on board the harvester. Higher field efficiency (performance rate) lets a farmers harvest his cotton in a shorter period. Precipitation causes cotton losses in both {{quality and quantity of}} the cotton. This paper seeks to measure cost per acre when harvest days are stochastic by using historic precipitation data. Cost per acre will include the cost of losses from a loss function from precipitation. Cost per acre will be adjusted for conventional versus new technology by quantifying the losses that contribute to extra costs of extended harvesting. <b>Cotton,</b> <b>harvester,</b> fieldwork days, stochastic, cost per acre, Agribusiness, Farm Management,...|$|E
40|$|Episodes of {{labor-saving}} {{technological change}} and rural urban migration have become universal patterns {{of economic development}} the world over. Donald Holley, in The Second Great Emancipation, sets out {{to tell the story}} of the last great episode of such change in the United States, when the cotton harvest was mechanized following World War II. The last major crop to make the transition from hand production, cotton was extraordinarily labor-intensive, especially the harvest. In 1945 millions of workers hand picked almost every boll of American cotton, but by 1970 farmers gathered their crop with John Deere and International Harvester mechanical cotton pickers. Folks, mainly blacks, who had for generations performed one of the most backbreaking forms of stoop labor, moved to northern and western cities. As Holley tells it, the First Great Emancipation occurred when President Lincoln freed the slaves and the Second Great Emancipation when the mechanical <b>cotton</b> <b>harvester</b> freed laborers from the drudgery of the cotton harvest, poverty, and Jim Crow discrimination, and southern producers from inefficient production methods and farm sizes. It is a really big and important story of profound technological and demographic changes with spillover effects into civil rights, racial economic equality, and politics. These events, for example, transformed race from a southern regional to a national issue. ...|$|E
40|$|The cotton {{harvesting}} {{industry is}} in the beginnings of its next technological advance, cotton harvesters that form cotton modules inside the machine then deposit them off the rows. These new machines {{eliminate the need for}} extra labor and equipment, but are more expensive than conventional pickers. Increased field efficiency is also a benefit of the on-board module builders. The problem facing producers is determining the optimal number of acres to plan for harvest when trying to decide which harvester to purchase. This paper examines two objectives. First, determine the cost per acre of both conventional and on-board module harvester systems for different acreage levels assuming harvest hours per year are fixed. Second, make the harvest hours per season stochastic to determine the cost per acre under different farm sizes for each type of cotton picker. The results show that the maximum benefits of the new machines are realized with larger farms when a larger number of acres need to be harvested in the harvest period. Results should help farmers plan both their cotton acre estimates as well as their purchase decisions for new cotton pickers. <b>cotton</b> <b>harvester,</b> harvest hours, cost per acre, field efficiency, on-board module builder, Crop Production/Industries, Financial Economics, Risk and Uncertainty,...|$|E

50|$|Labor-brokerage coyotajes {{continued}} to profit despite the Great Depression. Texas demand for <b>cotton</b> <b>harvesters</b> used coyotaje to recruit about 400,000 migratory workers {{by the end}} of the 1930s, two-thirds of which were Mexican. Coyotajes would load trucks with fifty to sixty workers to be delivered to different Texas companies. The practice received international attention in 1940 when a “delivery” truck got into an accident, resulting in forty-four Mexican migrant injuries and twenty-nine fatalities, including eleven children. The U.S. and Mexican governments worked together to end labor-brokerage coyotaje, by implementing the Bracero Program in 1942.|$|R

It was a way of life for thousands of farm families, and as miserable as the conditions may have been they persisted. Due to the lack of mechanization, hand labor was the primary means of planting, cultivating, and harvesting the cotton crop. This meant long hours of hard work in the hot Texas summers. The book, From Can See to Can't, by Thad Sitton and Dan Uttley describes the day to day activities of cotton farmers; because they literally worked from when the sun was up enough to see in the morning until it was too dark to see at night. Tenancy and cropping began to diminish in the late 1940 s and early 1950 s due to improved farm mechanization, in particular, the mechanical <b>cotton</b> <b>harvester.</b> Due to the small and tender nature of a cotton boll, developing a mechanical harvester required years of research and development. But ultimately, the goal was achieved and the need for thousands of low paid tenants and croppers was no longer necessary...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is comprised}} of three papers. The first paper describes in detail a planar dielectric probe design using finite element analysis to determine sensing range and efficiency. The probe is subsequently connected to a Keysight impedance analyzer to measure dielectric properties of raw cotton at controlled levels of moisture content, compressed densities, and source frequency sweeps. Sensitivity to compositional differences such as turnout (lint vs seed) and variety is also explored. The response to the different factors is shown graphically and further quantified statistically {{in the form of}} a predictive model for the complex permittivity (dielectric constant and loss tangent). The second paper extends the dielectric probe used in the first paper to real-time harvesting on a round-module <b>cotton</b> <b>harvester</b> by leveraging a packaged sensor with embedded impedance measurement circuit and probe all in one mobile unit. A moisture prediction model based on permittivity is developed from lab-measured data and adjusted based on field data collected during cotton harvesting in Fall of 2014 for pickers and Spring of 2015 for strippers. Verification of the prediction accuracy is performed on field data collected during cotton harvesting in 2016. Sources of variability and sensitivity to confounding factors are investigated and quantified. Finally, plots of diurnal trends of predicted and actual moisture content are overlaid for several days of harvesting. The third paper draws on the first two in applying capacitive-based moisture sensing to large-square bales of alfalfa. A lab characterization is performed on alfalfa over a wide range of moisture contents and densities using both the Keysight impedance analyzer and packaged sensor to measure permittivity. Field data (on-machine permittivity measurements of bales and corresponding ground truth moisture content) is subsequently collected during baling in 2015 and 2016 for alfalfa hay (3 ̆c 30...|$|E

50|$|When the U.S. {{entered the}} war it turned to Mexico to address wartime labor shortages. In August 1942 the Bracero Program was {{launched}} for {{the importation of}} temporary contract laborers from Mexico. By the time it ended in 1964 more than 4 million Mexican farm-workers arrived in the U.S. under this guest worker program, most of them destined for the cotton-fields and orchards of California's Central Valley and the Pacific Northwest, and the ranches and sugar beet farms of the Midwest. Texas chose {{to opt out of}} the Bracero program and hire farm-workers directly from Mexico. At its height, over 437,000 guest-workers entered the U.S. annually. The invention of mechanical <b>cotton</b> <b>harvesters</b> reduced labor needs, and scandals over the exploitation of guest workers led the Department of Labor official overseeing the program to denounce it as 'legalized slavery'.|$|R
50|$|According to EBRD {{transition}} indicators, Uzbekistan's investment climate remains {{among the}} least favorable in the CIS, with only Belarus and Turkmenistan ranking lower. The unfavorable investment climate has caused foreign investment inflows to dwindle to a trickle. It is believed that Uzbekistan has {{the lowest level of}} foreign direct investment per capita in the CIS. Since Uzbekistan's independence, U.S. firms have invested roughly $500 million in the country, but due to declining investor confidence, harassment, and currency convertibility problems, numerous international investors have left the country or are considering leaving. In 2005, the Central Bank has revoked the license of the nascent Biznes Bank citing unspecified violations of local currency exchange rules. The revocation prompted immediate bankruptcy procedures, under which clients' deposits stay arrested for two month. No interest was accrued during that two-month period. In 2006, the Government of Uzbekistan forced out Newmont Mining Corporation (at the time the largest U.S. investor) from its gold mining joint venture in the Muruntau gold mine. Newmont and the government resolved their dispute, but the action adversely affected Uzbekistan's image among foreign investors. The government attempted the same with British-owned Oxus Mining. Coscom, a U.S.-owned telecommunications company, involuntarily sold its stake in a joint venture to another foreign company. GM-DAT, a Korean subsidiary of GM, is the only known U.S. business to have entered Uzbekistan in over two years. It recently signed a joint-venture agreement with UzDaewooAuto to assemble Korean-manufactured cars for export and domestic sale. Other large U.S. investors in Uzbekistan include Case IH, manufacturing and servicing <b>cotton</b> <b>harvesters</b> and tractors; Coca-Cola, with bottling plants in Tashkent, Namangan, and Samarkand; Texaco, producing lubricants for sale in the Uzbek market; and Baker Hughes, in oil and gas development.|$|R
50|$|This tempo was {{accelerated}} in April 1919, when the RSGB mailed letters of inquiry to 5,000 American firms and circulated press kits to 200 trade-oriented newspapers.

50|$|Like most plantations, each tea {{plant at}} the Charleston Tea Plantation {{comes from a}} clone rather than a seed to keep plant {{characteristics}} controlled. In this factory, black, oolong, and green tea is made; active harvesting takes place between May and October. The hybrid <b>cotton</b> picker/tobacco <b>harvester</b> modified by Fleming is used to harvest from the upper parts of the plants without injuring them, but cannot do so with the precision of hand-picking, necessary for the highest grades of tea. Inside the factory, leaves are placed on a withering bed for 12-18 hours. Natural air blows over the leaves to reduce the moisture from 80 percent to 68 percent. Then the leaves are chopped, sent to the oxidation bed for 55 minutes, then baked in an oven for about 28 minutes. (These times vary slightly depending on the moisture content of the leaves.) Then the sticks and fibers are sorted out and the remaining leaves are packaged.|$|R
40|$|An {{overview}} of different methods developed and tested for material feed rate measurement during {{the work of}} harvesting machines is done. Many systems are known and just commercially used for grain flow measurement during the grain harvest by combine harvesters. The errors and their sources during the work of these systems described by many authors are discussed. The yield measurement methods are under developing for other harvesting machines, e. g. forage harvesters, mowing machines, potato, sugar beet, <b>cotton</b> and tomato <b>harvesters</b> etc. The function principles of systems based on weighing trailers or round balers are described as well. Two methods of the mowing machine material feed rate measurement were developed and tested. The measurements carried out proved that a very good linear relationship existed between the conditioner's power input, output frequency of the apparatus measuring impact force {{by means of the}} impact plate, and material feed rate through the mowing machine. The calculated R-Squared values were about 0, 95. The impact of materials and conditions changes on mowing machine material feed rate measurement accuracy was measured under laboratory conditions as well. It was evident from statistical evaluation that changing crop variety, crop maturity and intensity of conditioning can have statistically significant influence on the measurement based on torque-meter. For impact plate measurement it was find out that {{it is not possible to}} determine statistically the influence of testing factors from our measurements.
