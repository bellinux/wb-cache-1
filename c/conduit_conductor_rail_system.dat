Since wear is an inevitable effect on pantograph-catenary systems, {{it is necessary to}} determine optimal operating conditions that can mitigate its effects. In this study we have performed a simulation model of the pantograph-overhead <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> <b>system</b> which allows the evaluation of the dynamic conditions of the system through the contact force. With these results we have made an evaluation of the quality of current collection, a calculation of the pantograph wear and a definition of the optimal operation conditions of the pantograph-overhead <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
40|$|Overhead rigid {{conductor}} {{arrangements for}} current collection for railway traction have some advantages compared to other, more conventional, energy supply systems. They are simple, robust and easily maintained, {{not to mention}} their flexibility as to the required height for installation, which makes them particularly suitable for use in subway infrastructures. Nevertheless, due to the increasing speeds of new vehicles running on modern subway lines, a more efficient design is required {{for this kind of}} system. In this paper, the authors present a dynamic analysis of overhead <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> <b>systems</b> focused on the design of a new conductor profile with a dynamic behaviour superior to that of the system currently in use. This means that either an increase in running speed can be attained, which at present does not exceed 110 km/h, or an increase in the distance between the rigid catenary supports with the ensuing saving in installation costs. This study has been carried out using simulation techniques. The ANSYS programme has been used for the finite element modelling and the SIMPACK programme for the elastic multibody systems analysis...|$|R
2500|$|It is {{possible}} to supply power to an electric train by inductive coupling. This allows {{the use of a}} high-voltage, insulated, <b>conductor</b> <b>rail.</b> Such a <b>system</b> was patented in 1894 by Nikola Tesla, US Patent 514972. [...] It requires the use of high-frequency alternating current. Tesla did not specify a frequency but George Trinkaus suggests that around 1,000Hz would be likely.|$|R
500|$|The committee's {{preferred}} {{system was}} a 3,000volt, three-phase alternating current system proposed by Hungarian electrical engineering company Ganz. The system delivered current by overhead conductor wires and was cheaper than alternatives using power rails and required fewer electrical sub-stations. An experimental line had been constructed by Ganz in Budapest, although the system {{had not yet}} been adopted for the full-scale operation of a railway. Before the appointment of Ganz could be finalised, Yerkes took control of the DR. He and his engineers preferred the low voltage direct current <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> <b>system</b> they had worked with in the United States and were intending to use on the tube lines when they were constructed; they rejected the Ganz system putting the DR and the MDETC into dispute with the MR which wanted to proceed with the Ganz system. [...] After some acrimonious debate between the two companies, some of which was carried out in public through the letters pages of The Times newspaper, the dispute went to arbitration at the Board of Trade. The decision was made in December 1901 to use the four-rail system, although the arbitrator, Alfred Lyttelton, was critical of the DR's unilateral decision.|$|R
50|$|Third <b>rail</b> <b>systems</b> using top contact {{are prone}} to accumulations of snow, or ice formed from refrozen snow, and this can {{interrupt}} operations. Some systems operate dedicated de-icing trains to deposit an oily fluid or antifreeze (such as propylene glycol) on the <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> to prevent the frozen build-up. The third rail can also be heated to alleviate the problem of ice.|$|R
40|$|Overhead <b>rail</b> current {{collector}} <b>systems</b> for railway traction offer certain features, such as low installation height and reduced maintenance, which make them predominantly {{suitable for use}} in underground train infrastructures. Due to the increased demands of modern catenary systems and higher running speeds of new vehicles, a more capable design of the <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> is needed. A new overhead <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> has been developed and its design has been patented [13]. Modern simulation and modelling techniques {{were used in the}} development approach. The new <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> profile has a dynamic behaviour superior to that of the system currently in use. Its innovative design permits either an increase of catenary support spacing or a higher vehicle running speed. Both options ensure savings in installation or operating costs. The simulation model used to optimise the existing <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> profile included both a finite element model of the catenary and a three-dimensional multi-body system model of the pantograph. The contact force that appears between pantograph and catenary was obtained in simulation. A sensitivity analysis of the key parameters that influence in catenary dynamics was carried out, finally leading to the improved design...|$|R

50|$|The {{position}} of {{contact between the}} train and the rail varies: {{some of the earliest}} systems used top contact, but later developments use side or bottom contact, which enabled the <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> to be covered, protecting track workers from accidental contact and protecting the <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> from snow and leaf fall.|$|R

40|$|In {{overhead}} <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> lines, aluminium beams {{are usually}} mounted with support spacing between 8 and 12 meters, {{to limit the}} maximum vertical deflection {{in the center of}} the span. This small support spacing limits the use of overhead <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> to tunnels, therefore it has been used almost exclusively in metropolitan networks, with operation speeds below 110 km/h. Nevertheless, due to the lower cost of maintenance required for this electrification system, some railway administrations are beginning to install it in some tunnels on long-distance lines, requesting higher operation speeds [1]. Some examples are the Barcelona and Madrid suburban networks (Spain), and recent lines in Turkey and Malaysia. In order to adapt the design of the overhead conductor for higher speeds (V > 160 km/h), particular attention must be paid to the geometry of the <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> in critical zones as overlaps, crossings and, especially, transitions between <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> and conventional catenary, since the use of overhead <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> is limited to tunnels, as already mentioned. This paper describes simulation techniques developed in order to take into account these critical zones. Furthermore, some specific simulations results are presented that have been used to analyze and optimizes the geometry of this special zones to get a better current collection quality, in a real suburban network.

50|$|Electric {{railways}} with third rails, {{or fourth}} rails, in tunnels carry collector shoes projecting laterally (sideways), or vertically, from their bogies. The contact shoe may slide {{on top of}} the third rail (top running), on the bottom (bottom running) or on the side (side running). The side running contact shoe is used against the guide bars on rubber-tired metros. A vertical contact shoe is used on ground-level power supply systems, stud contact <b>systems</b> and fourth <b>rail</b> <b>systems.</b> A pair of contact shoes was used on underground current collection systems. The contact shoe on a stud contact system is called a ski collector. The ski collector moves vertically to accommodate slight variations in the height of the studs. Contact shoes may also be used on overhead <b>conductor</b> <b>rails,</b> on guide bars or on trolley wires. Most railways use three rails, while the London Underground uses four rails.|$|R
50|$|The trains have {{metal contact}} blocks called shoes (or contact shoes or pickup shoes) which {{make contact with}} the <b>conductor</b> <b>rail.</b> The {{traction}} current is returned to the generating station through the running <b>rails.</b> The <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> is usually made of high conductivity steel, and the running rails are electrically connected using wire bonds or other devices, to minimize resistance in the electric circuit. Contact shoes can be positioned below, above, or beside the third rail, {{depending on the type of}} third rail used; these third rails are referred to as bottom-contact, top-contact, or side-contact, respectively.|$|R

25|$|One oddity is that, {{almost from}} its opening until 1917, the Bakerloo {{operated}} with the polarity of the <b>conductor</b> <b>rails</b> reversed, the outside rail negative and the centre rail positive. This {{came about because}} the Bakerloo shared a power source with the District Railway. On the Bakerloo, the outside <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> tended to leak to the tunnel wall, whereas on the District Railway, the centre rail shared a similar problem. The solution was to reverse the polarity on the Bakerloo line, so that the negative rail leaked on both systems. In 1917, the two lines were separated when the LNWR began its 'New Line' service between Euston and Watford Junction, which the Bakerloo would share north of Queens Park. As a result, normal operation was restored.|$|R
