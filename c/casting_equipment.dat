5|$|The <b>casting</b> <b>equipment</b> and {{the metal}} dies {{represent}} large capital costs and this tends {{to limit the}} process to high-volume production. Manufacture of parts using die casting is relatively simple, involving only four main steps, which keeps the incremental cost per item low. It is especially suited for a large quantity of small- to medium-sized castings, which is why die casting produces more castings than any other casting process. Die castings are characterized by a very good surface finish (by casting standards) and dimensional consistency.|$|E
5|$|Die <b>casting</b> <b>equipment</b> {{was invented}} in 1838 {{for the purpose of}} {{producing}} movable type for the printing industry. The first die casting-related patent was granted in 1849 for a small hand-operated machine for the purpose of mechanized printing type production. In 1885 Otto Mergenthaler invented the linotype machine, an automated type-casting device which became the prominent type of equipment in the publishing industry. The Soss die-casting machine, manufactured in Brooklyn, NY, was the first machine to be sold in the open market in North America. Other applications grew rapidly, with die casting facilitating the growth of consumer goods and appliances by making affordable the production of intricate parts in high volumes. In 1966, General Motors released the Acurad process.|$|E
5|$|The main {{disadvantage}} to {{die casting}} {{is the very}} high capital cost. Both the <b>casting</b> <b>equipment</b> required and the dies and related components are very costly, as compared to most other casting processes. Therefore, to make die casting an economic process, a large production volume is needed. Other disadvantages are that the process is limited to high-fluidity metals, and casting weights must be between 30grams (1oz) and 10kg (20lb). In the standard die casting process the final casting will have {{a small amount of}} porosity. This prevents any heat treating or welding, because the heat causes the gas in the pores to expand, which causes micro-cracks inside the part and exfoliation of the surface. Thus a related disadvantage of die casting is that it is only for parts in which softness is acceptable. Parts needing hardening (through hardening or case hardening) and tempering are not cast in dies.|$|E

On Easter Sunday, Apr 19, 1987, VFP members {{marched on}} President Reagan's Western White House in California, and Vice President Bush's {{vacation}} home in Kennebunkport, Maine, protesting U.S. intervention in Central America. From May 4–18, 1987, sixteen members of VFP representing eight states traveled through Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua conducting site visits {{and interviews with}} high level government, military, religious and private sector elders, and talking with many average citizens. Following their return, they published a 40-page delegation report that was distributed to 5,000 opinion leaders in the United States including members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, the heads of many government offices and agencies, church, labor, and educational leaders, and media pace setters. In 1988, many VFP members participated in the Veterans Peace Convoy which was intended to truck medical and humanitarian aid to the suffering children of Nicaragua. Though the convoy was stopped by U.S. Customs and Treasury officials in Texas at the Laredo border checkpoint, on June 15, 1988, the vehicles were off-loaded into containers at a Texas port facility and about 95% of the cargo reached its destination in Nicaragua. In July 1988, VFP member Joe Ryan, an environmental scientist, of Tallahassee, Florida, established VFP's Nicaragua Environmental Science Project. Ryan spent two years working in Nicaragua training pollution control teams how to correct water contamination problems. The project was credited with significantly reducing the nation's infant mortality rate. Also in July 1988, VFP member Randy Parent of Caribou, Maine, drove a truckload of smelting and <b>casting</b> <b>equipment</b> to Guatemala where he established the Pro-Tierra Machine Tool Project to train members of several indigenous tribes how to make farm tools for the 100,000 members of the Pro-Tierra land reform movement.

40|$|Fuzzy control; Process control Abstract. Pressurization controlsystemplays an {{important}} role in the process control at the stages of riser-tube filling, mold-filling, pressure-increasing and pressure maintaining in counter-gravity casting. Casting quality is affected by theprecision of pressurization control systemto a great extent. Input and output scaling factors of conventional fuzzy controller are static, which is hard to ensure a suitable state for variouscounter-gravity <b>casting</b> <b>equipments.</b> A new fuzzy controller with self-tuning scaling factors has been developedin our laboratory, which will be described in this paper. Input and output scaling factors of fuzzy controller are tuned by different error ranges. When the differential pressure error is large, output scaling factor is increased to speed up dynamic response. At the same time, input scaling factors are also increased in order to reduce steady state error. Compared to fuzzy controller and conventional PID controller, fuzzy-PID controller with self-tuning scaling factors has more steady-state precision and excellent robustness. Experimental results show that at riser-tube filling stage and mold-filling stage the gas flow is stable, and the tracking property of pressurization control systemis very satisfactory...|$|R
