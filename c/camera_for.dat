5|$|Colleen and Suzanne Dengel, {{the twins}} who played Miranda's daughters, were cast {{two weeks after}} auditioning for Frankel and Finerman. The {{director}} and producer laughed, which the sisters believed help them get the part. They recalled in 2017 that they were excited both {{by being able to}} work together on <b>camera</b> <b>for</b> the first time, as well as the chance to act opposite Hathaway since they were big fans of the Princess Diaries movies as well.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, reviewers noted a lack {{of support}} for {{expandable}} storage, the initial absence of cellular connectivity, and the display's lower-than-expected contrast level, {{as well as an}} absence of a rear-facing <b>camera.</b> <b>For</b> the latter, an explanation from Asus claimed that the company decided to omit such a camera so as to not compromise the user experience and competitive pricing. Some consumers reported instances when the screen would not register inputs while the tablet performed data-intensive operations, while others complained about the build-quality of the screen.|$|E
5|$|Servicing Mission 3B {{flown by}} Columbia in March 2002 saw the {{installation}} of a new instrument, with the FOC (which, except for the Fine Guidance Sensors when used for astrometry, {{was the last of}} the original instruments) being replaced by the Advanced <b>Camera</b> <b>for</b> Surveys (ACS). This meant that COSTAR was no longer required, since all new instruments had built-in correction for the main mirror aberration. The mission also revived NICMOS by installing a closed-cycle cooler and replaced the solar arrays for the second time, providing 30 percent more power.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, the Advanced <b>Camera</b> <b>for</b> Surveys (ACS) main camera primary {{electronics}} {{failed in}} June 2006, {{and the power}} supply for the backup electronics failed on January 27, 2007. Only the instrument's Solar Blind Channel (SBC) was operable using the side-1 electronics. A new power supply for the wide angle channel was added during SM 4, but quick tests revealed this did not help the high resolution channel. The Wide Field Channel (WFC) was returned to service by STS-125 in May 2009 but the High Resolution Channel (HRC) remains offline.|$|E
5|$|The Aristarchus {{region was}} part of a Hubble Space Telescope study in 2005 that was {{investigating}} the presence of oxygen-rich glassy soils {{in the form of the}} mineral ilmenite. Baseline measurements were made of the Apollo 15 and Apollo 17 landing sites, where the chemistry is known, and these were compared to Aristarchus. The Hubble Advanced <b>Camera</b> <b>for</b> Surveys was used to photograph the crater in visual and ultraviolet light. The crater was determined to have especially rich concentrations of ilmenite, a titanium oxide mineral that could potentially be used in the future by a lunar settlement for extracting oxygen.|$|E
5|$|The RESCU Traffic Cameras {{are located}} at regular {{intervals}} along the parkway. The cameras, which are operated by the City of Toronto, can be viewed on television and online. The cameras are located on poles and are fixed in direction. There are 16 camera locations on the parkway. Most have one <b>camera</b> <b>for</b> northbound and one for southbound traffic. RESCU operators monitor the cameras for emergency purposes; local radio and television media use the service for traffic reports.|$|E

5|$|With {{production}} {{supervised by}} James H. White, Porter was assisted by George S. Fleming during {{the creation of}} Kansas Saloon Smashers. Fleming was an actor and scenic designer at Edison Studios, who had joined the studio in January 1901. Porter operated the <b>camera</b> <b>for</b> the film, and also developed the footage. Kansas Saloon Smashers marked {{one of the first}} short films to be created under Fleming and Porter's partnership. While none of the identities of the people who appeared in the picture are recorded, it is known the women in the film were played by men in drag, rendering them sexually unattractive.|$|E
5|$|A five-man crew, {{the first}} pilot, co-pilot, {{navigator}} radar, navigator plotter and air electronics officer (AEO) was accommodated within the pressure cabin on two levels; the pilots sitting on Martin-Baker 3K (3KS on the B.2) ejection seats whilst {{on the lower}} level, the other crew sat facing rearwards and would abandon the aircraft via the entrance door. The original B35/46 specification sought a jettisonable crew compartment, this requirement was removed in a subsequent amendment, the rear crew's escape system was often an issue of controversy, such as when a practical refit scheme was rejected. A rudimentary sixth seat forward of the navigator radar was provided for an additional crew member; the B.2 had an additional seventh seat opposite the sixth seat and forward of the AEO. These seats {{were no more than}} cushions, a full harness and an oxygen and intercom facility. The visual bomb-aimer's compartment could be fitted with a T4 (Blue Devil) bombsight, in many B.2s this space housed a vertically mounted Vinten F95 Mk.10 <b>camera</b> <b>for</b> assessing simulated low-level bombing runs.|$|E
5|$|After {{the liberation}} of France, Clouzot and several other {{directors}} were tried in court for collaborating with the Germans. For his sentence, Clouzot was forbidden from going on set of any film or from using a film <b>camera</b> <b>for</b> {{the rest of his}} life. Clouzot received letters of support from filmmakers and artists Jean Cocteau, René Clair, Marcel Carné and Jean-Paul Sartre, who were against the ruling. Clouzot's sentence was later shortened from life to two years. There is no official document making note of any apology or appeal. During his two-year banishment from filming, Clouzot worked with one of his supporters, Jean-Paul Sartre, who {{had been one of the}} first people to defend Le Corbeau.|$|E

5|$|Behind {{schedule}} and over-budget, the production crew struggled to complete production {{in time for}} the already-announced premiere date that October. On 6 July 1963, while scouting locations in Argyll, Scotland for that day's filming of the climactic boat chase, Terence Young's helicopter crashed into the water with art director Michael White and a cameraman aboard. The craft sank into 40–50 feet (12–15m) of water, but all escaped with minor injuries. Despite the calamity, Young was behind the <b>camera</b> <b>for</b> the full day's work. A few days later, Bianchi's driver fell asleep during the commute to a 6am shoot and crashed the car. The actress's face was bruised and Bianchi's scenes had to be delayed for two weeks while the facial contusions healed.|$|E
5|$|During the Mission Status briefing, Lead Flight Director Tony Ceccacci {{noted that}} during the camera survey of the {{equipment}} in the payload bay, the team noticed some fine particulate matter around the box containing the Wide Field Camera 3 and asked the crew to take additional images using a higher resolution <b>camera</b> <b>for</b> the ground teams to assess. Cain later confirmed that the dust was not present prior to launch, and was most likely particulate shaken loose from the thick insulation blankets inside the payload bay during launch. The team advised the crew to avoid the particulate {{as much as possible}} during the spacewalks, and use caution when working around the container to avoid the debris, {{but it was not a}} significant concern.|$|E
5|$|God of War: Chains of Olympus uses a proprietary, {{in-house}} engine {{referred to}} as the Ready at Dawn engine, which expanded on the engine created for their previous game, Daxter (2006), to include a fluid and cloth simulator. The camera system was modified to cater to the fixed cinematic <b>camera</b> <b>for</b> God of War gameplay, and the lighting system was reworked to aid in presenting realistic graphics. The game was originally designed for the PlayStation Portable's restricted 222megahertz (MHz) processor. Ready at Dawn repeatedly contacted Sony regarding increasing the clock speed of the PSP on account of the difference to the game and had developed a version of the game with higher speed. Sony released a firmware upgrade that allowed games to use the full 333MHz processor. The faster processor allowed for more realistic blood effects, lighting effects, and shadows as well as improved enemy intelligence. The upgrade, however, noticeably decreased battery life. After the game's completion, Game Director Ru Weerasuriya stated multiplayer options and other puzzles, characters, and dialogue had to be removed due to time constraints.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, imaging of {{the system}} with the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced <b>Camera</b> <b>for</b> Surveys {{revealed}} {{the presence of a}} secondary dust disk inclined at an angle of about 5° to the main disk and extending at least 130 AU from the star. The secondary disk is asymmetrical: the southwest extension is more curved and less inclined than the northeast. The imaging was not good enough to distinguish between the main and secondary disks within 80 AU of Beta Pictoris, however the northeast extension of the dust disk is predicted to intersect with the main disk at about 30 AU from the star. The secondary disk may be produced by a massive planet in an inclined orbit removing matter from the primary disk and causing it to move in an orbit aligned with the planet.|$|E
5|$|The fifth season saw several actors {{join the}} {{starring}} cast. Gbenga Akinnagbe returns as the previously recurring Chris Partlow, chief enforcer {{of the now}} dominant Stanfield Organization. Neal Huff reprises his role as Mayoral chief of staff Michael Steintorf having previously appeared as a guest star {{at the end of}} the fourth season. Two other actors also join the starring cast having previously portrayed their corrupt characters as guest stars—Michael Kostroff as defense attorney Maurice Levy and Isiah Whitlock Jr. as senator Clay Davis. Crew member Clark Johnson appeared in front of the <b>camera</b> <b>for</b> the first time in the series to play Augustus Haynes, the principled editor of the city desk of The Baltimore Sun. He is joined in the newsroom by two other new stars; Michelle Paress and Tom McCarthy play young reporters Alma Gutierrez and Scott Templeton.|$|E
5|$|There {{was a scene}} were I {{was lying}} on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance <b>camera</b> <b>for</b> marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' You could see {{the other members of the}} band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought it was some kind of gang slaying.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, Beebe went on an {{expedition}} to Haiti in order to document its marine life. Anchoring his ship the Lieutenant in the harbor of Port-au-Prince, he performed over 300 helmet dives examining the area's coral reefs and classifying the fish that inhabited them. These dives involved several technological innovations: a watertight brass box {{which could be used}} to house a <b>camera</b> <b>for</b> underwater photography, and a telephone which was incorporated into the diving helmet, allowing the diver to dictate observations to someone on the surface instead of having to take notes underwater. Within a hundred days, Beebe and his team had created a catalog of species inhabiting the area nearly as long as what had been assembled on the neighboring island of Puerto Rico in the past four hundred years. In 1928 Beebe and Tee-Van published an illustrated and annotated list of 270 such species, which was expanded in 1935 bringing the total to 324. Beebe provided an account of this expedition in his 1928 book Beneath Tropic Seas, which was the first of his books to receive less than enthusiastic reviews, due to its episodic structure.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the early}} years of the July Monarchy, Alkan {{continued}} to teach and play at public concerts and in eminent social circles. He became a friend of many who were active in the world of the arts in Paris, including Franz Liszt (who had been based there since 1827), George Sand, and Victor Hugo. It is not clear exactly when he first met Frédéric Chopin, who arrived in Paris in September 1831. In 1832 Alkan took the solo role in his first Concerto da <b>camera</b> <b>for</b> piano and strings at the Conservatoire. In the same year, aged 19, he was elected to the influential Société Académique des Enfants d'Apollon (Society of the Children of Apollo), whose members included Luigi Cherubini, Fromental Halévy, the conductor François Habeneck, and Liszt, who had been elected in 1824 at the age of twelve. Between 1833 and 1836 Alkan participated at many of the Society's concerts. Alkan twice competed unsuccessfully for the Prix de Rome, in 1832 and again in 1834; the cantatas which he wrote for the competition, Hermann et Ketty and L'Entrée en loge, have remained unpublished and unperformed.|$|E
