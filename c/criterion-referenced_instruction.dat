40|$|Precision Teaching (PT) {{began when}} Lindsley (1964) first applied the {{principles}} of functional behavior analysis {{and the use of}} count per minute measures to the "direct measurement and prosthesis of retarded behavior. " By designing a powerful new tool, the Standard Behavior Chart (Pennypacker, Koenig, and Lindsley, 1972), and conventions for using it to graph and make decisions about behavioral and curriculum interventions, Lindsley literally put science in the hands of students and teachers (Lindsley, 1990). By the early 1970 's, PT had become a new force in both regular and special education (Lindsley 1968, 1972). Its practitioners had begun to make important discoveries about the use of count per minute fluency standards or "aims " (Haughton, 1972), and about how to move students through curriculum sequences on the basis of fluency standards at each step along the way (Starlin, 1972). These were powerful new insights that added force to the practice and concepts of <b>criterion-referenced</b> <b>instruction</b> by defining mastery as accuracy plus speed, or fluency [...] not accuracy only. Demonstration projects during the late 60 's and early 70 's confirmed the power of this approach, showing that as little as 20 to 30 minutes per day of Precision Teaching in regular and special classrooms could boost children's achievement test scores by as much as 20 to 40 percentile points (Beck, 1979). Various large-scale assessment programs demonstrated the predictive validity of brief count per minut...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of varying instructional strategies on learning in emerging technology-based visual literacy instruction. The study used a completely crossed 2 (organizational strategy) x 2 (delivery strategy) x 2 (management strategy) factorial design, post-test only control group design. Organizational strategies employed included <b>criterion-referenced,</b> objectivist <b>instruction</b> and problem-based, constructivist instruction. Delivery strategies employed included local, computer-based instruction and networked hypermedia-based (World Wide Web) instruction. Management strategies implemented involved participation by individuals as well as cooperative dyads. Undergraduate education students (n= 138) were randomly assigned to eight treatment groups and a control group and received self-paced instructional treatments. Learners were assessed on performance (achievement), instructional efficiency, and efficiency of learner strategies employed (process efficiency). Achievement measures fo...|$|R
40|$|The resource/consulting teacher (R/CT) {{model is}} {{described}} as an integrative model, combining direct, resource services and indirect, consultative services. The R/CT provides direct, data-based instruction in resource settings, with a planned intent to return students to general classrooms. The R/CT also provides consultative services (indirect) to classroom teachers by (a) cooperatively and systematically transferring students back to general school programs, (b) offering problem-solving support to classroom teachers who teach students with academic and social behavior problems, and (c) assisting parents with home reinforcement and tutorial programs. This paper reviews the research bases {{for each of the}} various components that contribute to the R/CT model, including use of curriculum-based assessment, direct and data-based <b>instruction,</b> <b>criterion-referenced</b> mastery learning, stages of learning development, and applied behavior analysis. Relevant research on school consultation is summarized, and brief descriptions of cur-rent efforts to conduct field evaluations are included. ~HE RESOURCE/CONSULTING teacher (R/CT) modelis integrative because it builds upon the basic frame-work of the resource room model (Hammill & Wieder-holt, 1972; Jenkins & Mayhall, 1976) while expanding special education services to indirect, consultative sup-port as well (e. g., Idol, 1983; Idol, Paolucci-Whitcomb...|$|R
