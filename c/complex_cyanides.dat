Recovery tests from solution with and without river water, using various solvent combinations and background control were investigated to obtain an accurate and precise extraction method for the measurement of hydrogen cyanide in Kaduna River, Nigeria. The method enhanced the determination of undissociated hydrogen cyanide and the equilibria between hydrogen cyanide, cyanide ion and <b>complex</b> <b>cyanides.</b> A {{small portion of the}} hydrogen cyanide was extracted by equilibrating the sample with methylchloroform (1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane), methanol, hexane and 2 -octanol inclusions, respectively, in the solvent matrix with 2. 5 M NaOH. The extracted hydrogen cyanide is transferred into tetrasodium pyrophosphate solution and determined colorimetrically. A total cyanide concentration of 0. 03 mg/L in the river water and 0. 40 mg/L in an effluent water sample, respectively, were obtained by the proposed method compared to 0. 020 and 0. 45 mg/L from the established diffusion method. The proposed method was sensitive and reproducible in the range of 0 to 5 mgL - 1 of hydrogen cyanide with detectable limit of about 0. 01 mgL - 1...|$|E

40|$|Observations {{of comets}} and asteroids {{show that the}} Solar Nebula that spawned our {{planetary}} system was rich in water and organic molecules. Bombardment brought these organics to the young Earth's surface, seeding its early chemistry. Unlike asteroids, comets preserve a nearly pristine record of the Solar Nebula composition. The presence of cyanides in comets, including 0. 01 % of methyl cyanide (CH 3 CN) with respect to water, is of special interest because {{of the importance of}} C-N bonds for abiotic amino acid synthesis. Comet-like compositions of simple and complex volatiles are found in protostars, and can be readily explained by a combination of gas-phase chemistry to form e. g. HCN and an active ice-phase chemistry on grain surfaces that advances complexity[3]. Simple volatiles, including water and HCN, have been detected previously in Solar Nebula analogues - protoplanetary disks around young stars - indicating that they survive disk formation or are reformed in situ. It has been hitherto unclear whether the same holds for more complex organic molecules outside of the Solar Nebula, since recent observations show a dramatic change in the chemistry at the boundary between nascent envelopes and young disks due to accretion shocks[8]. Here we report the detection of CH 3 CN (and HCN and HC 3 N) in the protoplanetary disk around the young star MWC 480. We find abundance ratios of these N-bearing organics in the gas-phase similar to comets, which suggests an even higher relative abundance of <b>complex</b> <b>cyanides</b> in the disk ice. This implies that complex organics accompany simpler volatiles in protoplanetary disks, and that the rich organic chemistry of the Solar Nebula was not unique.

40|$|The {{principles}} and experimental techniques of {{electron spin resonance}} (esr) are outlined in the early chapters. A general investigation of low spin cobalt (II) complexes, in Chapter 3, indicates how the esr parameters are related to electronic and molecular structure. In Chapter 4, a solid state esr study of the paramagnetic pentacyanocobaltate (II) ion, in various alkali metal halide hosts, confirms a(dz,) 1 configuration for this d 7 ion and mixing of 4 s atomic orbital is invoked to explain the esr data. The extent of mixing of 4 s orbitals is also estimated for other low spin cobalt (II) complexes. In this study, some new halogenated cobaltous complexes were formed by thermal substitution of lattice halide ions. In {{the second half of}} the chapter, an investigation of the paramagnetic adduct of the pentacyanocobaltate (II) ion and phenyl nitroxide involved both liquid and solid state analyses. A novel method for linking data for the two phases is utilised to allow analysis of the complex powder spectra. The results are used to discuss the bonding in the molecule. In Chapter 5 the paramagnetic species to be discussed are produced by 8 -irradiation. Several d 6 transition metal <b>complex</b> <b>cyanides</b> are irradiated and d 7 species showing nitrogen hyperfine structure are observed. This hyperfine structure is shown to arise from a "bent" cyanide ligand, rather than an inverted cyanide (isocyanide) ligand as previously thought. The discovery of many more halogenated d 7 species led to an analysis of the electronic structure of these complexes and the differences in spin density distribution in the 3 d and 4 d series are discussed. An esr study of the hexanitritocobaltate (II) ion is reported in Chapter 6. The magnitude of the hyperfine couplings to cobalt and nitrogen are discussed and the radiation damage of the hexanitritocobaltate (II) ion is interpreted in relation to the damage of the analagous hexacyanide complex...|$|E
40|$|When two salts of {{different}} electro affinities {{are present in}} the same solution, complex salts my be formed, the stronger salt appearing to force the weaker into the anion. The suggestion that the abnormal behaviour of certain electrolytes might be accounted for by assuming the formation of complex ions was first put forward by Hittorf, who, {{in the course of his}} study of migration, discovered that the migration ratio for the anion in solution of many double salts and certain single ones increased rapidly with increase in the concentration of the solution, and at high concentrations became greater than unity. Hitterof suggested that this was due to the formation of a double salt in the solution, which gradually dissociated in dilution. By the action of potassium cyanide upon an aqueous solution of silver nitrate, there is first formed a white precipitate of silver cyanide. K. C N. + Ag NO 3 → Ag. CN + K NO 3. This precipitate dissolves in an excess of potassium cyanide, forming potassium silver cyanide. Ag. CN + K CN → K Ag (CN) 2. This is a typical salt of potassium, giving all the reactions of this metal. A precipitate of silver sulphide is formed on passing H 2 S through the solution but no precipitate of silver chloride is formed on the addition of a chloride showing that the concentration of silver ion in the solution is extremely small. Moreover, it can be shown by quantitative migration experiments that the silver migrates to the anode as part of the anion i. e. the salt is ionised thus K Ag. (CN) 2 â‡Œ Kâ º + Ag (CN) 2 Many examples of such <b>complex</b> <b>cyanides</b> are known. Hittorf showed that in a concentrated solution of equivalent amounts of cadmium iodide and potassium iodide, the cadmium formed part of a complex anion. McBain and Van Rysselberge (J. A. C. S. 50. 3009. 1928) have shown that "when sufficient excess of chlorine ions or sulphate ions is added to. 05 M solutions of salts contained a divalent ion, the migration of the anion is suppressed, or often reversed, showing that the sulphate or chlorine ions have combined with the undissociated molecules to form complex ions". Zinc forms salts of comparatively weak electro affinity, and consequently would be expected to form part of a complex anion in the presence of stronger salts such as those of the alkali and alkaline earth metals...|$|E
40|$|Silver <b>cyanide</b> <b>complexes</b> in {{wastewater}} from {{precious metals}} electroplating operations {{can be quite}} problematic, as the <b>complexed</b> <b>cyanide</b> is somewhat resistant to oxidation by conventional alkaline chlorination. Furthermore, silver is a valuable metal with a high market value and typical precipitation and clarification techniques do not readily allow recovery of the metal. It has long been recognized that ion exchange systems can be utilized to remove the silver <b>cyanide</b> <b>complex</b> from electroplating rinsewater. These metal complexes are strongly retained by anion resins and are difficult to remove with conventional strong base regeneration, so that often the exhausted resin is simply shipped off site for silver recovery by incineration, thereby resulting in high operating costs due to resin replacement. This paper will present the results of bench scale studies which examined the effectiveness of thiocyanate regeneration of the saturated resin for silver recovery. The spent regenerant was then treated by electrowinning to recover the eluted silver in a fairly pure state. Projected capital and operating costs for a 2 gpm regenerable ion exchange system were examined. Operating results of a full scale non-regenerated system are presented...|$|R

40|$|Paramagnetic {{resonance}} (p. r.) at {{low temperatures}} {{has been investigated}} {{in a number of}} substances in the solid state. Paramagnetic ions in the solid state are subjected to strong crystalline electric fields which profoundly modify the magnetic properties of the free ion. The orbital momentum of the free ion is completely or partially "quenched", leaving the spin momentum unaffected, except to a small extent due to spin-orbit coupling. The ground state consists of a number of levels, generally singlets or doublets. The separations of these levels may be varied by the application of an external magnetic field. If two levels have energies W 1 and W 2 and an external r. f. magnetic field, of frequency v such that h v = W 1 - W 2, is applied, transitions can be excited between the levels, within the limitations of certain selection rules. As the population of the two levels depends upon the Boltzman distribution there is a nett absorption of energy from the r. f. field when transitions occur. If this energy is lost to the crystal lattice quickly enough it is not reradiated. In practice a fixed frequency is chosen and the separation of the energy levels is adjusted by applying an external magnetic field so that the above condition is satisfied. By studying the fields at which the absorption occurs the position of the energy levels in zero field can be inferred. The energies of the levels may be expressed concisely {{in the form of a}} "spin hamiltonlan" which involves a number of parameters which have to be found experimentally. The general spin hamiltonian for an ion in a field of rhombic symmetry is: H = β(g x H x S x + g y H y S y + g z H z S z) + D [S 2 z - 1 ⁄ 3 S(S + 1) ] + E(S 2 x - S 2 y) + A x S x I x + A y S y I y + A z S z I z S is the effective spin chosen so that the multiplicity of the ground state is 2 S + l, β is the Bohr magneton, the g's are spectroscopic splitting factors along the axes of the crystal field. D represents the effect of the axial component of the field along the z axis and E represents the rhombic component of the crystal field. The transitions between the levels defined by these parameters give rise to the so-called fine structure lines. I is the nuclear spin and the terms in A, S and I represent the interaction between the magnetic moments of the electron and of the nucleus. This interaction splits each fine structure line into 2 I + l equally Intense, equally spaced hyperfine lines. Thus the number of hyperfine lines defines the nuclear spin unambiguously. Also the separatlon between the lines proportional to tbe nuclear magnetic moment so that in certain cases this can be estimated. The specimens used have usually consisted of single crystals of a diamagnetic salt containing about 1 % of an isomorphous paramagnetic salt. This dilution separates the paramagnetic ions and reduces tbe line width caused by their mutual interaction. Tbe experimental arrangement is of the standard type used in Oxford. Some refinements of technique have been used for particular experiments which needed them. Experiments have been performed at wavelengths between 10 em and 0. 8 mm. A klystron oscillator, run from a stabilised power pack, feeds power to a half wave resonant cavity which contains tbe sample placed in a position where the r. f. magnetic field is strong. This cavity can be placed in a dewar vessel of refrigerant and between tbe poles of an electromagnet. A wavemeter measures the wavelength and a crystal detector rectifies tbe power coupled out of the resonant cavity. The external field has a small 50 c/s modulation superimposed on it so that an absorption signal is swept through 100 times a second. The signal from the detector may then be amplified in a video-amplifier. If the amplified signal is fed to the Y-plates of an oscilloscope, which has a correctly phased 50 c/s time base, the trace displays a graph of absorption agalnst magnetic field within the region covered by the field modulation. This technique enables a spectrum to be analysed very rapidly. <b>Complex</b> <b>Cyanides</b> The p. r. spectra of two <b>complex</b> <b>cyanides</b> of divalent ions, K 4 V(CN) 6 3 H 2 O and K 4 Mn(CN) 6 3 H 2 O, have been studied. The orbital momentum of the vanadous ion is completely quenched so that it is in an S = 3 / 2 state and its behaviour resembles that of the same ion in ionic crystals. The g-value, 1. 992, is closer to the free spin value and the crystal field parameters, D = - 0. 0264 ± 0. 0004 em - 1 and E = - 0. 0072 ± 0. 0004 cm - 1, are smaller showing that the effect of higher levels is less than in the ionic salts. The hyperfine structure constant A = - 0. 00555 ± 0. 00003 cm - 1 is only 36 % smaller than in the ionic salts, showing that the configurational interaction which produces the hyperfine structure is not greatly modified by the covalent bonding. In the manganous ion the cubic field does not completely lift the orbital degeneracy of the ground state. The lowest triplet is split into a singlet and a higher doublet by the rhombic component of the crystal field so that the g-values differ widely from the free spin value. The ion behaves with effective spin S = 1 / 2 and has g-valuee g x = 2. 624 Â± 0. 008, g y = 2. 182 ± 0. 008 and g z = 0. 72 ± 0. 05. The hyperfine structure is also anisotropic and the hyperfine structure constants are A x = 0. 00845 Â± 0. 00005 cm - 1, A y = 0. 00465 Â± 0. 00005 cm - 1 and A z = 0. 0083 ± 0. 0013 cm - 1. The manganous ion in this type of compound resembles the titanic ion in ionic compounds and an attempt has been made to fit the parameters with the titanium theory of Abragam and Pryce (1951). This gives reasonable values for the configurational interaction constant and the mean value of the radius of the electron orbit. Nuclear spins The nuclear spin and magnetic moment of vanadium 50 has been measured in a crystal of K 4 Fe(CN) 6 3 H 2 O containing a few milligrams of vanadium enhanced to contain ~ 20 % 50 V. The spin was found to be six and the ratio of the nuclear gyromagnetic ratios of 50 V/ 51 V, 0. 380, agrees well with the value measured by nuclear resonance of 0. 3792. The spin and nuclear gyromagnetic ratio fit well with the values calculated by Hitchcock (1952) using a j-j spin-orbit coupling model of the nucleus and assuming &delta-function potential. The nuclear spin and magnetic moment of radioactive cobalt 57 have been measured in a crystal of K 2 Zn(SO 4) 2 6 H 2 O containing > 0. 5 μgrams of 57 Co. The crystal also contains some stable 59 Co up to 2. 4 μgrams total cobalt content. Only one set of hyperfine structure lines is resolved so tnat the spin and magnetic moment of 57 Co are tht same as 59 Co; i. e. the spin is 7 / 2 and the magnetic moment is 4. 6 ± 0. 2 nuclear magnetons. Chromic methylamine alum Paramagnetic resonance measurements on crystals of Cr(CH 3 NH 3 (SO 4) 12 H 2 2 O show that the crystals undergo a change in strucure at 157 ± 3 °K. Above this temperature the crystal symmetry is cubic and the Cr +++ ions are in a crystal field which has a small component. Below this temperature there is an additional rhombic componant in the crystal field and the crystal symmetry is lower, probably tetragonal. At both 90 °k and 20 °K the parameters in the spin hamiltonian are g = 1. 975 ± 0. 010, D = 0. 0871 ± 0. 0007 cm - 1 and K = 0. 0092 ± 0. 0008 cm - 1. These values give a stark splitting in zero field of 0. 177 ± 0. 002 cm - 1 which disagrees with the value of 0. 188 ± 0. 007 cm - 1 calculated by Kurti and Gardner (1954) from adiabatic demagnetisation measurements. Measurements at frequencies near the Stark splitting give results which lie between the two values so that it is not possible to say whether this descrepency is real. Measurements of nearest neighbour lines and of line widths indicate that there is extremely little exchange interaction between neighbouring Cr +++ ions. The transition is possibly due to a freezing out of a random rotary motion of the methylamine radical as the substance is cooled through the transition temperature. This temperature is the same as that found by Griffiths and Powell (1952) at which there is a discontinuity in the value of the dielectric constant. Interactions between neighbouring ions The p. r. spectrum of two adjacent consists of a series of lines, corresponding to the various orientations of the spins with respect to one another, which occur as satellites to the iines by isolated ions, the number of acid separation these satellites depends upon the size and nature of the interaction between them. The magnetic interaction may be calculated if the distance between the ions is known, so that if allowance is made for this, the size and nature of exchange interaction may be inferred from the positions of the satellite lines. Investigations of this sort have been done in crystals containing about 10 % paramagnetic salt in an isomorphous diamagnetic one, so that there is considerable chance of having two ions adjacent. A study of lanthanum ethyl sulphate containing up to 30 % neodymium shows that there is a small anisotropic exchange interaction with the two nearest neighbours and undetectable exchange interaction with the six next nearest. There is however no exchange with the next nearest neighbours in concentrated neodymium ethyl sulphate. This discrepancy is not explained. A study of nearest neigbbour satellites was made in KCr(SeO 4) 2 12 H 2 O. the problem is complicated by there being four ions in the unit cell all of which have different crystal field axes. It has not been possible to make an unambiguous interpretation of the results and the best interpretation does not agree with the results of adiabatic demagnetisation experiments of Kurti and Gardner (unpublished). The results of this type of investigation are rather discouraging and seem to indicate that one can hope to obtain satisfactory results only in particular substances. Rare earth ethyl sulphates Paramagnetic resonance has been observed in terbium etbyl sulphate using the yttrium salt as a dilutant. The spectrum may be explained using the hamiltonian postulated for the praseodymium salt (Bleaney and Seovil, 1952) : H = g // βH z S z + AS z I z + AS x where g // = 17. 72 ± 0. 02, S = 1 / 2, I = 3 / 2, A = 0. 209 ± 0. 002 cm - 1 and Δ = 0. 387 ± 0. 001 cm - 1. The lowest level is a doublet J z = ± 6 which is admixed with J x = 0 by the crystal field. This admixes the + 6 and - 6 levels and ΔM = 0 transitions are obtained if the r. f. magnetic field is placed parallel to tbe external field. The nuclear spin of terbium 159 is estimated to be 1. 5 ± 0. 4 nuclear magnetons. The work of Bleaney and Seovil (1952) on praseodymium ethyl sulphate has been extended using yttrium ethyl sulphate as a dilutant. The assymmetrical line shape is explained as being tbe result of the splitting Δ in the above hatmiltonian not having a single value but a Gaussian distribution of values, the nuclear magnetic moment of praseodymium 141 is estimated to be 4. 5 ± 1. 1 nuclear magnetons. </p...|$|E

40|$|During {{the gold}} cyanidation process, cyanide can be lost from the {{leachate}} by various chemical routes. Since cyanide is generally {{the most expensive}} reagent in this process, {{it is becoming increasingly}} important to monitor these cyanide losses. The products of these cyanide losses include base metal <b>cyanide</b> <b>complexes,</b> thiocyanate and cyanate. The two most significant cyanicides in order of importance are sulfides and copper bearing minerals. The problems caused by cyanide soluble copper minerals are well known to the gold processing industry and have been reviewed by several authors (e. g. 1, 2). One particular facet of this problem concerns the effect of the CN:Cu mole ratio, R, on the gold leaching kinetics. In order to efficiently leach cupriferous ores, it is important that R is maintained at a level that allows sufficiently rapid leaching without excessive use of cyanide. An additional consideration when leaching cupriferous ores is the oxidation of cyanide by Cu(11) minerals, resulting in the formation of cyanate. Ion chromatography (IC) has been successfully used for the determination of <b>cyanide,</b> metal <b>cyanide</b> <b>complexes,</b> thiocyanate and cyanate in leachates. Most of the important metal-cyanide complexes and thiocyanate can be determined by reverse phase ion interaction chromatography (e. g. 3, 4, 5, 6). Cyanide and cyanate are both unretained in the separation of the metal <b>cyanide</b> <b>complexes</b> and are not detectable as their respective anions. However, it has been possible to determine cyanide in this separation by either precolumn derivatisation with Ag to form [Ag(CN) J (4) or post-column derivatisation with a selective colourimetric reaction to produce a visible dye (5). There are no reactions suitable for the analogous pre or post column derivatisation of cyanate in the above separation of metal <b>cyanide</b> <b>complexes.</b> Cyanate has been determined separately on an anion exchange column (e. g. 7, 8, 9).

40|$|Heavy {{metal and}} cyanide {{contamination}} in electroplating wastewater can pose a serious environmental problem if not removed prior to discharge (Rajeswari and Sailaja 2014). Electrocoagulation {{has been shown}} to effectively remove many of these contaminants separately using batch treatment systems (Adhoum et al. 2004). The present study seeks to test the technologic efficacy of mixed electrocoagulation and hydroxide precipitation to simultaneously treat metals common to the electroplating industry (Ni+ 2, Cu + 2, Sn+ 2), and cyanide (CN−). The ultimate goal of the study is to offer a process which has the potential for use in continuous treatment. ^ Cyanide ion (CN-) begins to form volatile and dangerous hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in increasing concentrations as the pH drops below 11. At the same time, literature shows a drop-off in metal removal efficiencies using electrocoagulation at pH’s above 10 (Kobya et al. 2010). To overcome this drop, process variables such as current density, agitation rate, and volumetric flow rate of air were optimized using removal speed and final concentration as the chosen metrics. The data followed first and pseudo-first order kinetics which allowed the rate constants to gauge the relative rates of removal. ^ The present work was able to reduce Ni+ 2, Cu+ 2, Sn+ 2 and CN− concentrations below the discharge limits set forth by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The electrocoagulation cell conditions were optimized at a current density of 50 ASF, spin speed of 0 RPM, and volumetric flowrate of air of 0. 0022 ft 3 /min. This, along with a treatment time of 112 minutes, yielded an electricity consumption of 0. 0206 kwh/L and an iron consumption of 3. 83 g/L. ^ The study showed aeration to be necessary in achieving EPA discharge limits for <b>complex</b> <b>cyanide</b> removal. The use of aeration decreased the final concentration of <b>complex</b> <b>cyanide</b> from 4. 1 to 0. 91 mg/L after 2 hours of treatment. Testing also revealed direct reduction of metallic contaminants to the cathode to be another method of removal. Overall, the study shows electrocoagulation to be technologically and economically viable when treating high speed electroplating effluent. Due to the chosen conditions, the process also has the possibility of being extended to continuous treatment in the future. ...|$|R

From the complex structures {{it is observed}} that subunits with and without an inhibitor/catalytic water molecule are linked by N-terminal domain swapping. Comparing mammalian- and fungal- catalases, we speculate that NADPH-depleted mammalian catalases may function as a domain-swapped dimer of dimers, especially during inactivation by inhibitors like cyanide and azide. We further speculate that in mammalian catalases the N-terminal hinge-loop region and α-helix is the structural element that senses NADPH binding. Although the above arguments are speculative and need further verification, as a whole our studies have opened up a new possibility, viz. that mammalian catalase acts as a domain-swapped dimer of dimers, especially during inhibitor binding. To generalize this concept to the formation of the inactive state in mammalian catalases in the absence of tightly bound NADPH molecules needs further exploration. The present study adds one more intriguing fact to the existing mysteries of mammalian catalases...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an application of}} a taste sensor for detection of cyanide in the factory drain. Total cyanide of the water quality standard is the amounts of free <b>cyanide</b> and <b>complex</b> <b>cyanide.</b> Generally, total cyanide is detected with pretreatment of distillation and pH adjustment. Therefore, detection of total cyanide needs a pretreatment time. The taste sensor consists of multichannel sensors with lipid membranes which are modeled on living organisms. One of characteristics of this sensor is a global selectivity. So, we tried to detect total cyanide using the taste sensor. We could detect total cyanide under the guideline limit. It was possible to detect free cyanide below the concentration 3 ppm in the factory drain. Measurement time is within five minutes. We found that total cyanide can be detected with a simple pretreatment. The evaluation of the water quality using the taste sensor is an effective method, and is suited for constant monitoring of the factory drain quality. The taste sensor can be considered to have very powerful performance and advantage for real-time monitoring of water quality...|$|R

40|$|While cyanide {{is known}} to be {{produced}} by many organisms, including plants, bacteria, algae, fungi and some animals, it is generally thought that high levels of cyanide in aquatic systems require anthropogenic sources. Here, we report accumulation of relatively high levels of cyanide in non-polluted salt marsh sediments (up to 230 μmol kg[superscript − 1]). Concentrations of free cyanide up to 1. 92 μmol L[superscript − 1], which are toxic to aquatic life, were detected in the pore-waters. Concentration of total (free and <b>complexed)</b> <b>cyanide</b> in the pore-waters was up to 6. 94 μmol L[superscript − 1]. Free cyanide, which is released to the marsh sediments, is attributed to processes associated with decomposition of cord grass, Spartina alterniflora, roots and possibly from other sources. This <b>cyanide</b> is rapidly <b>complexed</b> with iron and adsorbed on sedimentary organic matter. The ultimate cyanide sink is, however, associated with formation of thiocyanate by reaction with products of sulfide oxidation by Fe(III) minerals, especially polysulfides.

40|$|Fischer–Tropsch {{synthesis}} {{has been}} performed {{with a series}} of alumina-supported copper–iron catalysts, which are prepared via deposition–precipitation of stoichiometric <b>cyanide</b> <b>complexes,</b> viz. Cu 2 Fe(CN) 6, Cu 3 [Fe(CN) 6] 2 and CuFe(CN) 5 NO onto ¿-Al 2 O 3. The catalysts are characterized in situ by magnetic measurements and Mössbauer spectroscopy. Upon exposure of the reduced catalysts to synthesis gas at 548 K, the metallic iron rapidly reacts to a mixture of e'-Fe 2. 2 C and ¿-Fe 5 C 2 carbides. Prolonged reaction causes the contribution of ¿-Fe 5 C 2 to increase {{at the expense of the}} e'-Fe 2. 2 C. Infrared spectroscopy performed with a Cu 2 Fe catalyst after intermittent Fischer–Tropsch reactions at increasingly higher temperatures indicates at 300 K the presence of both Fe- and Cu-like sites at the surface of the bimetallic particles. The number of Cu-like sites, however, decreases at 373 K and becomes negligible at 423 K. At 473 and 548 K beside absorption bands due to CO bridged-bonded on Fe-like sites, bands assigned to hydrocarbons, formate species and to carbonates are observed. The activity of the thus prepared copper–iron catalysts is substantially higher than that of a monometallic iron catalyst prepared from a <b>complex</b> <b>cyanide.</b> However, the activity decreases from an initial level of 135 – 95 to about 20 – 15 mmol C/(kg Fe s) within 252 ks, while the monometallic iron catalyst exhibits an activity of about 1. 5 mmol C/(kg Fe s) after 252 ks.

It was found that polyvalent metal cyanide molecules were adsOlbed efficiently, while divalent metal cyanide molecules were adsorbed satisfactorily.
