6000|$|Mr. Lockhart, we {{are happy}} to say, has avoided both these errors. He uniformly treats Burns as the high and {{remarkable}} man the public voice has now pronounced him to be: and in delineating him, he has avoided the method of separate generalities, and rather sought for characteristic incidents, habits, actions, sayings; in a word, for aspects which exhibit the whole man, as he looked and lived among his fellows. The book accordingly, with all its deficiencies, gives more insight, we think, into the true character of Burns, than any prior biography; though, being written on the very popular and condensed scheme of an article for Constable's Miscellany, it has less depth than we could have wished and expected from a writer of such power, and contains rather more, and more multifarious, quotations, than belong of right to an original production. Indeed, Mr. Lockhart's own writing is generally so good, so <b>clear,</b> <b>direct,</b> <b>and</b> nervous, that we seldom wish to see it making place for another man's. However, {{the spirit of the}} work is throughout candid, tolerant, and anxiously conciliating; compliments and praises are liberally distributed, on all hands, to great and small; and, as Mr. Morris Birkbeck observes of the society in the backwoods of America, [...] "the courtesies of polite life are never lost sight of for a moment."

50|$|In contrast, the {{dew point}} {{measurement}} is considerably more complex. The original dew point sensor deployed on ASOS systems utilized a chilled mirror that is cooled {{to the point where}} a fine film of condensation forms on the mirror's surface. The temperature of the mirror at this condition is equal to {{the dew point}} temperature. The hygrometer measures the dew point by directing a light beam from a small infrared diode {{to the surface of the}} mirror at an angle of 45 degrees. Two photo transistors are mounted so they measure a high degree of reflected light when the mirror is <b>clear</b> (<b>direct)</b> <b>and</b> scattered light when the mirror is clouded with visible condensation (indirect). With the formation of condensation on the mirror, the degree of cloudiness of the mirror surface increases with the direct transistor receiving less light and the indirect transistor more light. The output from these photo transistors controls the mirror cooling module which is an electronic heat pump that operates much like a thermocouple in reverse, producing a heating or cooling effect. When the sensor is first activated, the mirror is clear. As the mirror surface temperature is cooled to the dew point temperature, condensations forms on the mirror. The electronics continuously tries to stabilize the signal levels to the power amplifier to maintain the mirror temperature at the dew point. If the dew point of the air changes or if the circuit is disturbed by noise, the loop makes the necessary corrections to restabilize at the dew point and maintaining continuous operation.|$|E

In various non-CKD populations, suPAR has been proposed as a prognostic marker for mortality and cardiovascular disease. However, {{it is not known}} whether suPAR holds prognostic information {{in patients with}} mild-to-moderate CKD. In a prospective observational study of 476 patients with mild-to-moderate kidney disease, we examined multivariate associations between suPAR, overall mortality, and cardiovascular events. After a mean follow-up of 57 months, 52 patients died and 76 patients had at least one fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular event. Higher suPAR was directly and significantly associated with both overall mortality (univariate hazard ratio 5. 35) and cardiovascular events (univariate hazard ratio 5. 06). In multivariate analysis, suPAR remained significantly associated with cardiovascular events (full model, hazard ratio 3. 05).

Therefore it appears that self-esteem, while related to crucial variables, does not provide a <b>clear,</b> <b>direct,</b> <b>and</b> comprehensive prediction of psychological symptoms. Thus, it was hypothesized that the relationship between self-esteem and symptomatology would be moderated by broader measures of how one interacts with emotional and cognitive stimuli. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the influence of self-esteem, psychological flexibility, and cognitive flexibility on psychological symptomatology. A sample of 82 undergraduate students at the University of North Texas completed self-report questionnaires measuring low self-esteem, psychological flexibility, measured inversely as inflexibility, cognitive flexibility, and psychological symptoms. Results of the study suggest that self-esteem (?= - 0. 59, p < 0. 001) and flexibility (both psychological (?= 0. 36, p = 0. 001) and cognitive (?= 0. 21, p < 0. 05) are significant predictors of psychological symptoms. In other words, self-esteem is positively correlated with psychological symptoms, while psychological and cognitive flexibility are negatively correlated with psychological symptoms. Neither form of flexibility moderated the relationship between self-esteem and psychological symptoms in this sample. The findings of the current study are discussed as well as suggestions for further research related to self-esteem, psychological and cognitive flexibility, and their impact on psychological outcomes...|$|E

Building regulation cannot be effectively carried out without such standards. The critical role of standards in the building regulatory process is such that the standards are {{an extension of the}} code requirements and are therefore equally enforceable. Consequently, standards that are referenced in codes carry an expectation of being as <b>clear,</b> <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> enforceable as code requirements that are primary text. In recognition of this need, the International Code Council has included in Council Policy # 28 Code Development (CP # 28) criteria that standards must meet in order to be referenced in the International Codes. The purpose of this document is to provide information that will aid in the understanding of the referenced standards criteria and provide guidance to standards developers and other users of the International Codes on the application and implementation of policy. This guide consists of five sections, the first of which is an introduction that summarizes briefly the role of standards in codes. Following the introduction are three distinct parts. Part I consists of a description of the referenced standards criteria and discussion of their purpose. Part II contains examples of how two prominent provisions of the policy apply, the requirements that standards be written using mandatory language and developed through a consensus process. Part III provides answers to frequently asked questions related to the purpose, use and implementation of the referenced standards criteria.

40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the relation between severity of obstruction to left ventricular outflow and left ventricular ejection time in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. With dual catheters across the left ventricular outflow tract, the pressure gradient and corresponding left ventricular ejection time were measured in 10 patients as the pressure gradient was pharmacologically provoked or abolished, or both. The patients were studied during constant atrial pacing to avoid the potential errors introduced with heart rate correction equations. The pressure gradient was pharmacologically provoked or reduced over a range of ≥ 62 mm Hg per patient. In each patient the left ventricular ejection time varied directly with the pressure gradient (mean r = 0. 97, range 0. 92 to 1. 00). The change in magnitude of the pressure gradient varied directly with the corresponding change in the measured ejection time (mean r = 0. 98, range 0. 97 to 1. 00). When the data from all 10 patients were pooled with use of Weissler's heart rate correction equation, the relation between the corrected left ventricular ejection time and the pressure gradient was still significant and linear (r = 0. 86), but less so than in individual patients. This difference was the result of marked interpatient variability in the slope of this linear relation reflecting interpatient differences in other important factors, such as underlying myocardial contractility and stroke volume, that influence left ventricular ejection time. This study demonstrates a <b>clear,</b> <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> highly significant relation between the magnitude of the pressure gradient and the left ventricular ejection time in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. These findings suggest a causal relation between the pressure gradient and ejection time and support the concept that the pressure gradient in this condition represents a true mechanical impediment to left ventricular outflow...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an alternative method to tune Monte Carlo electron beam parameters to match measured data using a minimal set of variables {{in order to}} reduce the model setup time prior to clinical implementation of the model. Monte Carlo calculations provide the possibility of a powerful treatment planning verification technique. The nonstandardized and nonautomated process of tuning the required accelerator model is one of the reasons for delays in the clinical implementation of Monte Carlo techniques. This work aims to establish and verify an alternative tuning method that can be carried out in a minimal amount of time, allowing it to be easily implemented in a clinical setting by personnel with minimal experience with Monte Carlo methods. This tuned model can then be incorporated into the MMCTP system to allow the system to be used as a second dose calculation check for IMRT plans. The technique proposed was used to establish the primary electron beam parameters for accelerator models for the Varian Clinac 2100 6 MV photon beam using the BEAMnrc Monte Carlo system. The method is intended to provide a <b>clear,</b> <b>direct,</b> <b>and</b> efficient process for tuning an accelerator model using readily available clinical quality assurance data. The tuning provides a refined model, which agrees with measured dose profile curves within 1. 5 % outside the penumbra or 3 mm in the penumbra, for square fields with sides of 3 cm up to 30 cm. These models can then be employed as the basis for Monte Carlo recalculations of dose distributions, using the MMCTP system, for clinical treatment plans, providing an invaluable assessment tool. This was tested on six IMRT plans and compared to the measurements performed for the pretreatment QA process. These Monte Carlo values for the average dose to the chamber volume agreed with measurements to within 0. 6 %...|$|E
