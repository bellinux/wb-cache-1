40|$|This {{study of}} {{alluvial}} aquifer basins in southern California {{is centered on}} observations of differential surface displacement {{and the search for}} the mechanisms of deformation. The San Bernardino basin and the Upper Coachella Valley aquifers are bound by range fronts and fault segments of the southern San Andreas fault system. I have worked to quantify long-term compaction in these groundwater dependent population centers with a unique synthesis of data and methodologies using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and groundwater data. My dissertation contributes to the understanding of alluvial aquifer heterogeneity and partitioning. I model hydrogeologic and tectonic interpretations of deformation where decades of overdraft conditions and ongoing aquifer development contribute to extreme rapid subsidence. 	I develop the Hydrogeologic InSAR Integration (HII) method for the characterization of surface deformation in aquifer basins. The method allows for the separation of superimposed hydraulic and/or tectonic processes in operation. This formalization of InSAR and groundwater level integration provides opportunities for application in other aquifer basins where overdraft conditions may be causing permanent loss of aquifer storage capacity through compaction. 	Sixteen years of SAR data for the Upper Coachella Valley exhibit rapid vertical surface displacement (# 8804; 48 mm/a) in sharply bound areas of the western basin margin. Using well driller logs, I categorize a generalized facies analysis of the western basin margin, describing heterogeneity of the aquifer. This allowed for assessment of the relationships between observed surface deformation and sub-surface material properties. 	Providing the setting and context for the hydrogeologic evolution of California's primary aquifers, the mature San Andreas transform fault is studied extensively by a broad range of geoscientists. I present a compilation of observations of <b>creep,</b> <b>line</b> integrals across the Pacific-North America Plate Boundary, and strain tensor volumes for comparison to the Working Group 2007 (UCERF 2) seismicity-based deformation model. I find that the moment accumulation across the plate boundary is consistent with the deformation model, suggesting fault displacement observations within the plate boundary zone accurately capture the strain across the plate boundary.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of lightly stabilised granular base materials are considerably affected by in-situ environmental {{conditions such as}} freeze-thaw (f-t), wet-dry (w-t) actions and changes in moisture content. Unlike cemented materials, durability studies related to lightly stabilised granular materials are very limited and their durability against these environmental variables are unknown. The existing laboratory tests which are relevant for assessing durability of stabilised soils are not well received by the pavement engineers as they have testing procedures which is subjective and requires time that is longer than the acceptable time frame. The main objectives of this research are to assess the durability of lightly stabilised granular materials using different laboratory experiments focussing on various {{mechanical properties}} and to determine the suitable test method and testing protocols. Specimens of two granular base parent materials stabilised with varying binder contents were subjected to different environmental actions and tested to obtain various mechanical properties. Laboratory tests such as unconfined compressive strength (UCS), repeated load triaxial (RLT), flexural beam test and vacuum saturation test (VST) {{were included in the}} testing program. Furthermore, non-destructive tube suction test (TST) was also added because of its potential acceptability. Along with the assessment of durability, permanent deformation (PD) characterisation of lightly stabilised granular base materials was also investigated using RLT and accelerated pavement model (APM) tests. The shakedown theory was mainly used to classify the material responses obtained from the RLT and to determine limits classifying different range of responses. A finite element (FE) analysis was used to back-calculate the moduli of stabilised base and subgrade materials of the APM test and its PD was analysed with RLT tests to form a relationship between these two tests and to develop equations to predict the PD of PM for different stress combinations. In first set of durability study, two granular materials, Canberra materials (CM) and Queensland materials (QM), stabilised with 1. 5 % of cement-flyash (CF) were chosen for the experiments. Standard UCS cylindrical specimens moulded with different moisture contents were used to investigate four testing procedures such as UCS after 7 -day, 12 f-t cycles, vacuum saturation and TST. UCS measured after 12 f-t cycles directly related to f-t durability tests whereas the other three tests were added to the testing programs due to their acceptability in predicting the durability of the stabilised materials. F-t durability test showed that the specimens remained integrated after 12 f-t cycles and showing resistivity against f-t cycles with no visible fissures or cracks on them. However, comparison with 7 -day UCS revealed that the 12 f-t cycles deteriorated the materialâ€™s UCS. Another series of specimens tested for UCS after subjecting them to vacuum and saturation also lasted the entire testing program without showing any disintegration. The regression analysis showed that the outcomes from 7 -day UCS, f-t durability test and VST produced better correlation among them and replacing f-t durability test with either VST or 7 -day UCS is viable for evaluating f-t durability of lightly stabilised granular materials. However, the dielectric values (DVs) measured using TST did not relate well with the UCS obtained from these tests and further study is required before TST is acceptable as a potential test to evaluate f-t durability of lightly stabilised materials. Despite its limited ability to assess the durability of the lightly stabilised granular material, TST revealed outcomes that gave more insight about the materials behaviour. The DVs showed dependency to moulding moisture content and binder content in which decrease in moisture content resulted in decrease in DVs and increasing binder content showed reduction in DVs. UCS of lightly stabilised granular material after TST showed that the DVs are not very well related to UCS, but the trend depicted that the material with lower DVs tend to show higher UCS. This research showed that the use of quality porous disk and having smooth top surface of the specimen are essential for obtaining reliable results from TST. In the next series of tests, different factors that could influence the laboratory f-t durability tests were investigated using UCS, repeated load triaxial (RLT) and flexural beam tests. This is to obtain the best combinations of variables {{that could be used to}} assess the f-t durability of lightly stabilised granular base materials. In the RLT test, resilient moduli (Mr) and permanent deformation (PD) were determined to evaluate the resilient and permanent deformation behaviour of specimens subjected to f-t cycles. Parent granular material, method of curing, curing time (or age), binder content, f-t testing procedure and number of f-t cycles were selected as variables. UCS and RLT tests showed that, irrespective of the testing procedure or variables, lightly stabilised material performed well against destructive f-t actions. However it was found that there were two factors that needed attention in the selection of a better laboratory f-t durability test; one is number of days of curing and the other is the moisture content. The UCS and RLT tests revealed that the curing age has an influence on the properties obtained after f-t cycles. To avoid strength gain during the f-t cycles, a better approach is to cure in an accelerated environment. Supplying moisture during the thawing phase was found to be important to replicate the field condition and to observe the adverse f-t effects within a reasonable amount of time. Compared with resilient modulus, PD from RLT test clearly identified the f-t effects when the specimens were subjected to higher deviatoric stresses. F-t durability study performed on flexural properties of specimens stabilised with 1. 5 % and 3 % of CF showed that f-t actions deteriorated the tensile capacity, considerably higher than other properties, of the material. Similar to f-t test durability study, the w-d durability study was performed using UCS, RLT and flexural test. All three tests performed on QM specimens stabilised with 1. 5 % CF showed heavy deterioration after few w-d cycles and not a single specimen lasted 12 w-d cycles. However, increasing the CF binder content to 3 % produced enough resistance to w-d actions and UCS after 12 w-d cycles was significantly higher than the 7 -day UCS of the same material not subjected to w-d cycles. Due to the high temperature in the drying phase of a w-d cycle, the strength gain due to accelerated cementitious and pozzalanic reaction was evident particularly in specimens cured for less number of days. Therefore, it was possible to notice strength gain instead of loss in the first few w-d cycles. Furthermore, similar to the outcome of f-t durability test, the MoR and SSM were found to be more vulnerable to w-d cycles than other properties with single w-d cycle causing significant reduction in tensile capacity of QM specimens stabilised with 1. 5 % of CF. Characterising the PD behaviour using RLT test was performed on CM stabilised with 0. 5 % and 1. 5 % of CF and cured for 7 days. Specimens stabilised with 0. 5 % of CF were tested for moisture contents of 8 % and 6. 5 % for four and three different confining pressures respectively and three moisture contents of 8 %, 6. 5 % and 5 % were selected for specimens stabilised with 1. 5 % of CF binder at one confining pressure of 50 kPa. The PD behaviour from each stress sequences were classified based on the accumulated permanent strain from 3000 to 5000 load cycles into range A, B or C shakedown behaviour. Based on this classification, shakedown limit calculations were performed to obtain plastic <b>creep</b> <b>line</b> (PCL) and plastic shakedown line (PSL). The established shakedown limit equations can be used to predict the materialâ€™s performance for given stress combinations while considering the impact of moisture content. Furthermore, log and power based permanent deformation prediction models were developed to relate permanent strain with number of loading cycles. These two equations were fitted with the experimental data to obtain the regression coefficients and the log model showed better fit to the experimental data than the power model. The regression coefficients were further analysed to obtain their dependency on stress values and an equation was established to predict the PD in terms of bulk stress and confining stress. Finally, APM testing was performed on a pavement model constructed in a cylindrical tank having 600 mm of subgrade and 150 mm of lightly stabilised base. The model pavement was instrumented with linear variable differential transformers (LVDTs), moisture probes (MPs) and earth pressure cells (EPCs) for measuring vertical deformations, moisture and pressures respectively. The measurement from MPs showed that soil-specific calibration is essential to improve the accuracy of the measurements and MP 306 moisture sensors can be used for continuous moisture measurement. The obtained deformations data were used to back calculate the moduli of both subgrade and base using a FE model developed in ABAQUS. Vertical and horizontal pressure distributions of experimental and finite element model showed that EPCs can be used to measure pressures to a reasonable accuracy. The permanent deformation (PD) measurement showed that the rut depth measured in the subgrade was found to be approximately three times that of the lightly stabilised granular base of the pavement. The study also emphasizes the need to characterise the deformation behaviour for every stress sequence to avoid continuing the test for higher number of load cycles which would reveal very little about the materialâ€™s behaviour. Finally, using RLT test data and FE analysis, a model in terms of bulk-stress was developed for predicting the accumulated permanent deformation of pavements for different combinations of stresses...|$|E

40|$|In this study, DEM {{simulations}} of triaxial creep tests on dense and loose sand samples {{were carried out}} to examine the micromechanics involved during creep. The simulated creep responses reproduce qualitatively the published experimental results. During the primary creep, the creep stress is gradually borne by the contact normal forces instead of contact tangential forces so that the columnar particle structures can be formed. This process also leads to a continuous decrease in the creep rate. The columnar structures eventually are completely formed and the creep rate reaches a minimum. However, the structures become meta-stable and susceptible to buckling. This explains why a sand packing does not show {{an extended period of}} secondary creep in the experiment. Buckling of the columnar structures also gives rise to maximum dilatancy and a sharp transition of the major fabric orientation of weak forces from horizontal to vertical. The continuous buckling process of columnar structures increases the creep rate and sliding ratios of contacts during the tertiary creep. In addition, the trend of contact tangential forces decreasing and contact normal forces increasing is reversed. Finally creep rupture occurs as the <b>creep</b> stress-strain <b>line</b> intersects the complete stress-strain curve.

The operating temperatures of 930 - 1000 degrees C heat the inner refractory face up to 950 degrees C and the exterior face to 750 degrees C.

Most of the song's lyrics speak directly to incidents in Sarah Kane's 1998 dark-themed play Crave, so much so that it was titled [...] "Crave" [...] up to the last minute. [...] "Sun in My Mouth" [...] is an adaptation of E.E. Cummings' poem [...] "I will wade out/Till my thighs are steeped in burning flowers", with an emphasis on the vocal and accompaniment provided by a string orchestra, a harp, and soft electronica. The track's lyrics have been considered a [...] "startling allusion to masturbation", positioned [...] "within the fantasy-like imagery of burning flowers, sea-girls, darkness and the sun". This track, and the album in general, have a [...] "resounding message of sexual liberation" [...] that reinforces BjÃ¶rk's [...] "resistance to the socially constructed categories of gender," [...] which has generated analysis associating it with Donna Haraway's 1983 essay, A Cyborg Manifesto.|$|R
40|$|In the {{northern}} United States, substantial turfgrass loss occurs due to severe and prolonged cold stress during winter. Cool-season turfgrass is generally have higher cold tolerance characteristic, however large energy inputs {{are required for}} preparation and recovery of turfgrass from cold stress. Freezing injury of turfgrass can have an economic and environmental impact as well as reduced aesthetic values of commercial turfgrass. Although maximum damage occurs during late winter to early spring, during deacclimation, but the biological process during acclimation (late fall to early winter) governs significant role for cold tolerance mechanism. Stimulation of the antioxidant response system, phenolic synthesis, biosynthesis of other protective metabolites, and shifts in overall metabolic pathways are common responses in plants during biotic and abiotic stresses. ^ Genetic heterogeneity is major drawback for induction of phenolic production for higher fitness in specific varieties during stress in cross-pollinated species like seeded creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.). Therefore, one major aim of this dissertation was screening and selection of single seed origin high phenolic <b>creeping</b> bentgrass clonal <b>lines</b> from a heterogeneous seed source and evaluation of these lines under different stress conditions. Further, the performance of other cool-season turfgrasses (perennial ryegrass, Kentucky bluegrass and tall fescue) under cold and UV-B stress, was evaluated to understand the role of antioxidant enzyme response and proline-associated pentose phosphate pathway in these species during abiotic stress. ^ Results indicated a significant genetic heterogeneity among single seed origin <b>creeping</b> bentgrass clonal <b>lines.</b> High phenolic clonal lines showed higher antioxidant activity and greater fitness during cold stress. Exogenous application of natural antioxidant stimulator significantly improved the fitness of these clonal lines by stimulating antioxidant enzyme response and higher phenolic biosynthesis. Significant biochemical adjustments were observed in cool-season turfgrasses during cold acclimation which may govern their fitness during winter injury. A strong association between proline synthesis and pentose phosphate pahway stimulation was found in cool-season turfgrasses under stress-induced conditions. Higher pentose phosphate pathway stimulation along with proline accumulation and enhanced phenolic synthesis were most significant responses observed in the investigated turfgrass species during cold and UV-B stress. Among different antioxidant enzymes, guaiacol peroxidase activity was consistently higher in these turfgrasses, while superoxide dismutase and catalase activity varied widely with species and clonal lines. Stimulation of phenolic biosynthesis coupled with proline-associated pentose phosphate pathway was also reflected in higher photochemical efficiency and higher visual quality of turfgrasses under cold and UV-B stress. ...|$|R
500|$|Another memorable {{race that}} year for Prost {{was at the}} San Marino Grand Prix. He was {{cruising}} to victory when his car began {{to run out of}} fuel three corners from the chequered flag. Frantically weaving the car back and forth to slosh the last drops of fuel into the pickup, he managed to keep it running just long enough to <b>creep</b> over the <b>line</b> and win the race (Prost commented after the race that when his car started running dry he immediately thought to himself [...] "shit, I am going to lose this race again", referring to his 1985 disqualification at Imola). It happened again at the German Grand Prix: while running in fourth position, Prost's car ran out of fuel on the finishing straight of the last lap. Instead of retiring at a time in the season when points were critical, Prost got out of his car and tried to push it to the finish, to great applause from the crowd. The finish line was too far, though, and he never reached it. He was eventually classified sixth in the race, as the seventh-placed car (the Brabham-BMW of Derek Warwick) was a lap behind.|$|R

Abstract. â€“ Magnetic {{relaxation}} in a type-II superconductor is simulated for a {{range of}} temperatures T in a simple model of 2 D Josephson junction array (JJA) with finite screening. The high-T phase, that is characterised by a single time scale Ï„Î±, crosses over to an intermediate phase at a lower temperature Tcr wherein a second time scale Ï„Î²â‰ªÏ„Î± emerges. The relaxation in the time window set by Ï„Î² follows power law which is attributed to self-organization of the magnetic flux during relaxation. Consequently, for T Jc) to sub-critical (J < Jc) state separated by an intermediate state with frozen dynamics is observed. Both Ï„Î± and Ï„Î² diverges at Tsc < Tcr, marking the transition into a state with true persistent current. Introduction. â€“ In a hard type-II superconductor, flux-creep over energy barrier at a finite T leads to magnetic relaxation over long time scales. The flux creep, occurring due to thermally activated hopping of the flux lines, tend to reduce the local field gradient dB dx, and hence th...|$|R

60|$|Geoffrey {{began work}} early next day, and {{afterwards}} week by week toiled from dawn until nearly sunset, blasting clear minor reefs and ledges until he attacked the mother rock under {{the lip of}} a clashing fall. The fee promised {{was by no means}} large, and, because current wages prohibited assistance, he did all the work himself. So he shoveled dÃ©bris and drilled holes in the hard blue grit; and drilling, single-handed, is a difficult operation, damaging to the knuckles of the man attempting it. He waded waist-deep in water, learned to carry heavy burdens on his shoulder, and found his interest in the task growing upon him. He felt that much depended upon the successful completion of his contract. It was not, however, all monotonous labor, and there were compensations, for, after each day's toil was done, he lay prone on scented pine twigs, and heard the voices of the bush break softly through the solemn hush as, through gradations of fading glories along the lofty snows, night closed in. He would watch the black bear grubbing hog-fashion among the tall wild cabbage, while the little butter duck, paddling before its brood, set divergent <b>lines</b> <b>creeping</b> across the steely lake until the shadows of the whitened driftwood broke and quivered.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} an {{experimental}} study on millimetre-size electrochemically evolved hydrogen bubbles. A method to generate gas bubbles controlled in number, size at detachment {{and place on}} a flat electrode is reported. Partially wetted composite islands are implemented on a polished metal substrate. As long as the island size is lower than a limit depending on its wettability, only one bubble spreads on the island and its size at detachment is controlled by the island perimeter. The composite, a metal-polytetrafluoroethylene (Ni-PTFE), is obtained by an electrochemical co-deposition process. On the contrary to predictions of available models for co-deposition, at current densities beyond Ni 2 + limiting current density, the mass ratio of PTFE in the deposit strongly increases. A mechanism is proposed to describe co-deposition when hydrogen bubbles are co-evolved. The observation of gas evolution on fully hydrophobic electrodes highlights the fact that bubbles growth rate on such electrodes differs from growth rates when bubble growth is controlled by mass transport of dissolved gas. The more a bubble grows by coalescence the more its foot expands on the electrode the bigger its size at detachment. This triple <b>line</b> <b>creeping</b> mechanism explains why, when attached bubbles coalesce many times before detaching, their size at detachment increases with current density...|$|R
