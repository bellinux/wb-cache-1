40|$|Background: Computerized {{analysis}} of breath sounds {{has relied on}} human auditory perception as the reference standard for identifying <b>crackles.</b> In this study, we tested the human audibility of <b>crackles</b> by superimposing artificial clicks on recorded breath sounds and having physicians listen to the recordings {{to see if they}} could identify the <b>crackles.</b> Objectives: To establish the audibility of simulated <b>crackles</b> introduced in breath sounds of different intensity, to study the effects of <b>crackle</b> characteristics on their audibility, and to investigate <b>crackle</b> detection within and between observers. Methods: Fine, medium, and coarse <b>crackles</b> with large and small amplitude were synthesized by computer software. Waveform parameters were based on published characteristics of lung sound <b>crackles.</b> The amplitude for small <b>crackles</b> was defined as just above the threshold of audibility for simulated <b>crackles</b> inserted in sound recorded during breath hold. Simulated <b>crackles</b> were then superimposed on breath sounds recorded at 0 L/s (breath hold), 1 L/s, and 2 L/s airflow. Five physicians listened during playback on two separate occasions to determine if <b>crackles</b> could be heard and to calculate the interobserver and intraobserver variations.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} lung <b>crackle</b> characteristics by time-expanded waveform (TEW) analysis in patients with asbestosis (AS), asbestos-related pleural disease (ARPD) and left ventricular failure (LVF). TEW was performed on a 33 s recording from each of 40 patients (12 AS, 17 ARPD and 11 LVF). They were 38 men and two women. <b>Crackles</b> on TEW were counted during inspiration and expiration, and the timing of clusters of <b>crackles</b> with respect to inspiration and expiration was noted. A total of 1117 <b>crackles</b> were identified. The initial deflection width (IDW) and the two cycle duration (2 CD) were calculated for all <b>crackles</b> within one respiratory cycle for each patient (total of 298 <b>crackles).</b> <b>Crackles</b> were detected by TEW in all patients with AS, in seven patients with ARPD and in nine patients with LVF. <b>Crackles</b> in AS were mainly fine, mid- to late-inspiratory. <b>Crackles</b> in LVF took three patterns; in the first there were repetitive mid- to late inspiratory <b>crackles</b> similar to those seen in AS except that the <b>crackles</b> in LVF tended to be medium and coarse as well as fine (three patients); in the second <b>crackles</b> started early in inspiration followed by a crackle-free period then by another cluster of <b>crackles</b> lasting to the end of inspiration and to the early third of expiration (four patients) and in the third there were repetitive expiratory <b>crackles</b> with no or few inspiratory <b>crackles</b> (two patients). <b>Crackles</b> in ARPD generally took the configuration of fine <b>crackles</b> but another type of <b>crackle</b> preceded by a sharp deflection followed by an M-shape oscillation then by the largest oscillation was also found. IDW and 2 CD for inspiratory <b>crackles</b> in ARPD were shorter than those in AS and LVF (for IDW P < 0 · 009 and P < 0 · 003 compared with AS and LVF respectively and for 2 CD, P < 0 · 006 and P < 0 · 003 compared with AS and LVF respectively). IDW and 2 CD in AS tended to be shorter than these for LVF but these results did not reach statistical significance. It is concluded that many differences exist between <b>crackles</b> in AS, LVF and ARPD. Differences in nature and timing of <b>crackles</b> may reflect differences in the pathophysiology and mechanism giving rise to lung <b>crackles</b> in these conditions. TEW provides informations of diagnostic value...|$|R

40|$|Objective. It is {{generally}} accepted that <b>crackles</b> {{are due to}} sudden opening of airways and that larger airways produce <b>crackles</b> of lower pitch than smaller airways do. As larger airways are likely to open earlier in inspiration than smaller airways and the reverse {{is likely to be}} true in expiration, we studied <b>crackle</b> pitch as a function of <b>crackle</b> timing in inspiration and expiration. Our goal was to see if the measurement of <b>crackle</b> pitch was consistent with this theory. Methods. Patients with a significant number of <b>crackles</b> were examined using a multichannel lung sound analyzer. These patients included 34 with pneumonia, 38 with heart failure, and 28 with interstitial fibrosis. Results. <b>Crackle</b> pitch progressively increased during inspirations in 79 % of all patients. In these patients <b>crackle</b> pitch increased by approximately 40 [*]Hz from the early to midinspiration and by another 40 [*]Hz from mid to late-inspiration. In 10 % of patients, <b>crackle</b> pitch did not change and in 11 % of patients <b>crackle</b> pitch decreased. During expiration <b>crackle</b> pitch progressively decreased in 72 % of patients and did not change in 28 % of patients. Conclusion. In the majority of patients, we observed progressive <b>crackle</b> pitch increase during inspiration and decrease during expiration. Increased <b>crackle</b> pitch at larger lung volumes is likely a result of recruitment of smaller diameter airways. An alternate explanation is that <b>crackle</b> pitch may be influenced by airway tension that increases at greater lung volume.

5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema (air {{trapped in the}} subcutaneous tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. Subcutaneous emphysema, present in up to 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when {{it is only in}} the neck. Air is trapped in the chest cavity outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid the chest cavity of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into the chest cavity from the site of the tear. Air can also be trapped in the mediastinum, the center of the chest cavity (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of <b>crackling</b> that occurs in time with the heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E
5|$|Indium is a silvery-white, highly ductile post-transition metal with {{a bright}} luster. It is so soft (Mohs {{hardness}} 1.2) that like sodium, it can be cut with a knife.

Like tin, a high-pitched cry is heard when indium is bent – a <b>crackling</b> sound due to crystal twinning. Like gallium, indium is able to wet glass. Like both, indium has a low melting point, 156.60°C (313.88°F); higher than its lighter homologue, gallium, but lower than its heavier homologue, thallium, and lower than tin. The boiling point is 2072°C (3762°F), higher than that of thallium, but lower than gallium, conversely to the general trend of melting points, but similarly to the trends down the other post-transition metal groups because of the weakness of the metallic bonding with few electrons delocalized.|$|E

40|$|Two acoustically {{different}} types of lung <b>crackles,</b> fine and coarse, occur in different pathophysiological conditions. To differentiate these <b>crackles</b> from objective characteristics of frequency information, <b>crackles</b> were recorded from 16 patients with pulmonary fibrosis judged clinically to have "fine" <b>crackles</b> and from 10 with chronic bronchitis who had mainly "coarse" <b>crackles.</b> Time expanded waveforms (1 / 4 cycle duration, initial deflection width, two cycle duration, and 9 / 4 cycle duration; duration of the first 1 / 4, 2 / 4, 8 / 4, and 9 / 4 cycles of <b>crackle</b> waveforms) were examined and fast Fourier transform analysis (peak and maximum frequencies) was performed. All waveform measurements for fine <b>crackles</b> were significantly smaller than those for coarse <b>crackles.</b> Peak and maximum frequencies for fine <b>crackles</b> {{were significantly higher than}} those for coarse <b>crackles.</b> Although there was some overlap in these values for individual <b>crackles</b> between the two groups when average values of these measurements were calculated for each patient, there was no overlap between fine and coarse <b>crackles</b> and the two groups could be clearly separated. Log peak frequency and log maximum frequency correlated better with 9 / 4 cycle duration (r = 0. 85, 0. 84) and two cycle duration (r = 0. 87, 0. 86) than with 1 / 4 cycle duration (r = 0. 66, 0. 77) or initial deflection width (r = 0. 67, 0. 79). Early and late segments of <b>crackles</b> have different characteristics, probably related to the origin of the sound and the resonance of the lung respectively.
