40|$|The {{software}} tool ALISA (adaptive learning image and signal analysis) {{has been applied}} to the automation of acoustic quality tests of industrial goods, to the recognition of micro calcinosis in mammography and for the classification of stroke thicknesses in <b>cadastral</b> <b>plans.</b> In car production classification into 'good' and 'bad' is obtained within fire seconds with an exactness as high as that of subjective examinators and even better. Micro calcinosis recognition by an ALISA-based prototype is being tested in a large field study. Mammography data treatment on a Pentium-PC is achieved within 2 min. For vector recognition in vectorized <b>cadastral</b> <b>plans</b> ALISA has been combined with components of classical image analysis. Recognition rates amount to 92 %. In addition to the described application cases, a vector quantization and a wave transformation for two-dimensional signals have been integrated into the ALISA tool.

He had bought {{a piece of land}} next to the {{existing}} town, and he obtained permission from his lord to extend and rebuild the town, and to resettle the population of the surrounding area, selling the house lots to the settlers. The highly symmetrical layout is centred on a canalised river and an intersecting street. The symmetry is disturbed, however, by the church in the eastern corner and by the pre-existing street (the only curved one in the whole town) on the northwest side. The corner bastions and the wide outer ditch were added in the late 16th century.|$|E

A document of founding, or one granting town rights, has never been found. In a document from 1295, however, Borgholz is already called a town. After it was founded, roughly 500 people, according to a careful estimate, lived in the town. From an 1831 <b>cadastral</b> <b>plan</b> of the town, {{it is clear that the}} whole town, along with the castle, was ringed by a wall enclosing an area of 6.22 ha.

Within the walls, however, was still a fair deal of free land which could have been used for expansion.|$|E

Overlapping data from the analysis of predial toponyms, the examination of imperial diplomas, the quantitative analysis of notarial medieval sources, the series of maps and views, the Gregorian and Rustic cadasters, the series of current <b>cadastral</b> <b>plans</b> reassembled in the mosaic of ground plans, it is possible to outline the history of a settlement, in cases where the documentation is not sufficient to provide an exhaustive picture.

The case of San Vito Romano, yet not studied in deep within specialized literature, shows a stratification of early interventions, separated and then aggregated anew by synecism, a medieval settlement such as the Colonna Castle, lately extended by residential fabric as in other cases in the area, with the urban Baroque addition built by Mario Theodoli (1649). San Vito Romano thus represents a meaningful case of study to apply a method: reconstructing the history of a small historical centre for the definition of a preservation plan...|$|R

50|$|At first, {{there was}} a prayer room {{available}} to Langenlonsheim's Jewish residents {{in one of the}} community's houses. One such place was mentioned in 1823. Beginning in the 1840s, the village's Jews wanted to build themselves a synagogue, and in 1856, Samuel Weiss managed to acquire a plot on Hintergasse (a lane) for just such a thing. It is believed that the synagogue was built about 1860, for the building is shown in the 1863 <b>cadastral</b> <b>plan.</b> It was a simple plastered building built out of brick and quarrystone. There was seating inside for roughly 50 worshippers, and {{there was a}} women's gallery. For some 70 years, the synagogue was the hub of Jewish life in Langenlonsheim. On Kristallnacht (9-10 November 1938), the synagogue was overrun by Nazi thugs from within Langenlonsheim and without. Doors, windows and the indoor furnishings (pews, the bimah, cabinets, tables, chairs, the ark and so on) were broken up, the floor was torn out and the walls were damaged. The Judaica, including three Torah scrolls, three sets of silver ceremonial jewellery, two silver candlesticks, an eternal lamp, a menorah and more were destroyed or stolen. On 24 April 1940, Rudolf Mayer, a Jew still living in Langenlonsheim, was forced to sell the synagogue for only 427.50 ℛℳ to a non-Jewish private citizen as the Jewish community found itself undergoing dissolution. In 1950, the sale was annulled, whereupon there was a change in ownership. In 1958, the synagogue building was torn down. Another building was built on the plot. The synagogue stood where the building whose address is Hintergasse 30 now stands.|$|E

Kao pilot područje odabrana je K. o. Brckovljani. Transformacija katastarskih podataka obavljena je korištenjem Jedinstvenog transformacij­skog modela i 7 -parametarske transformacije. Rezultati usporedbe dviju trans­formacija upućuju na Jedinstveni transformacijski model kao bolje rješenje, budući da za razliku od 7 -parametarske transformacije izbjegava dodatne ra­dove potrebne za određivanje lokalnih parametara te daje zadovoljavajuću točnost. U postupku homogenizacije, glede gustoće, određena su tri uzorka identičnih točaka uspoređujući katastarski plan s digitalnim ortofoto planom mjerila 1 : 5000. Najveća postignuta gustoća od 0, 16 IT/ha, iako ekonomski najnepovoljnija, pokazala se kao jedina opravdana opcija u tehničkom smislu, budući da su manje gustoće na kontrolnim točkama upućivale na degradaciju točnosti katastarskog plana, što ni u kom slučaju nije dopustivo. Cadastral data play {{important}} role in many fields directly or indirectly associated with their use (land surveying, architecture and urban planning, civil engineering, agronomy, forestry, transport, tourism, etc.). In forestry cadastral data mostly are used to manage forest land through the planning, protection, conservation and sustainable development. In past 10 years there are significant changes in legislation concerning the official spatial data which are also reflected on the cadastral data. Certainly {{two of the most}} important changes are the introduction of new geodetic datum and map projection, and also transition to real estate cadastre. These proces­ses {{for a wide range of}} users will induce new investments in the transforma­tion of existing, or acquisition of new related maps in the new datum and projection if they want to be overlaid with the cadastral data. Except the transformation to new datum and projection, in the process of transition from land cadastre to real estate cadastre it is necessary to conduct homogenization. This process is needed after transformation, for cadastral municipalities with older cadastral surveys conducted with graphical method. This process is required for solving poor <b>cadastral</b> <b>plan</b> geometric accuracyrelated to graphical method technical limitations. Homogenization is defined with identical points collected by the usage of Digital OrtoPhoto in scale 1 : 5000 (DOP 5). Since Croatia is on the beginning of this kind of works, this paper examines the transformation methods of cadastral data and the optimal selection of iden­tical point’s density on the sample of cadastral district Brckovljani (Figure 1). The transformations of cadastral data were performed by the national GRID model transformation and 7 -parameter transformation (Table 1). For transformations control purposes, coordinates of 4 trigonometric points mea­sured with CROPOS system (directly in new datum with specified precision of 2 cm) are used. Statistical values for the GRID transformation meet the expec­tations (Table 2, left), and some improvements in 7 -parameter transformation (Table 2, right) could be expected if locally estimated parameters will be used. However, main problems with the local parameters are extra efforts for their district level estimation and related complications with continuity of transfor­mations on district borders. The GRID transformation model, after it become official, seems like appropriate solution. In the process of homogenization basic principle for the selection of an identical point is its stability since the time of cadastral survey. Most of the ca­dastral plans (approximately 75 %) are created by surveys older than 100 years, so this principle is very difficult to meet. Before the selection of identical points, 200 x 200 meters grid was constructed to support their easier selection and regular distribution. Selection is performed in 3 different densities over­laying DOP 5 (density I – 0, 16 IP/ha, density II – 0, 07 IP/ha and density III – 0, 02 IP/ha). For the control of identical point’s density impact on the final re­sults of homogenization, set of 44 control points is used. The situation with geometry of the <b>cadastral</b> <b>plan</b> before homogenization could be seen in Figure 3 and Table 3. Impact of identical point’s density is evaluated comparing stati­stics on control points before homogenization (Table 3, right), and after this process (Table 4). Only the densest set of identical points (0, 16 IP/ha) has sta­tistical indicators better after than before homogenization. Density has crucial impact on the costs of the homogenization process but on this example it is easy to see that savings in this segment could degrade geometry of <b>cadastral</b> <b>plan</b> which is unacceptable...|$|E

His Provision on Land Restructuring in Dalmatia from 1756 was appropriately named after him, the Grimani Law, just like the cadastre of this period was named the Grimani Cadastre and the integral <b>cadastral</b> <b>plans</b> the Grimani Maps. However, as time went by, the title Grimani Maps started being used for some 17 th and 18 th century <b>cadastral</b> <b>plans,</b> which did not originate from Francesco Grimani’s reform. Therefore, authors describe available archival finding aids from the State Archive in Zadar which may help in analysing cartographic material known as the Grimani Maps. The oldest finding aid is Böttner’s handwritten inventory, which provides systematization for 800 maps, plans and drawings kept in the Archive. It has been paid special attention in this paper, even though it does not specifically mention the Grimani maps. However, it {{should be taken into}} consideration since it is still in use, despite being the oldest one. Appendix A contains basic information about E. Böttner’s life and work. Afterwards, the Tabularium journal, which was published in the period 1901 – 1904 is analysed in detail. A review of archival material from the Zadar State Archive was published in its first issue. The material is associated with the present Grimani Maps Collection and paid considerable attention in this paper. It represents the first printed summarised inventory of the Zadar Archive. The entire content of all Tabularium issues is presented in Appendix B for the first time. A description of internal inventory of the State Archive in Zadar follows {{and for the first time}} it presents a collection of cadastral maps titled Grimani Maps. The description is followed by an analysis of a Review of Archival Funds and Collections of the Republic of Croatia from 2006, as well as the latest network information system, ARHiNET. Based on comparing the aforementioned finding aids, certain conclusions are drawn which should be helpful to future researchers. A provisional distinction of the Grimani Maps in broader as well as in narrower sense is suggested until a better title for the collection is found. Furthermore, future research, as well as digitalisation of maps and finding aids is advised in order to preserve the original and facilitate data access...|$|R
40|$|New {{technologies}} are emerging and abound everywhere. They have made surveying practice quite interesting and easier. But our rural areas where majority population is residing are still quite under surveyed {{in this era}} of new emerging technology. Hence, our rural cadastre and land management remains in comatose. Investigations have shown that practicing surveyors still use the analogue driven instruments for most if not all their survey works. They lacked the innovation and prerequisite knowledge of the new technologies. Hence, they exhibit a lot of lukewarm in training and re-training programmes in the new methodologies. Also, existing laws (legislations) are archaic as there are no provisions for implementation of the new technologies. Further, our rural areas lacked the necessary reference framework (controls) to ensure that surveys are carried out to produce <b>cadastral</b> <b>plans</b> (to show size/extent, shape, ownership, etc) of land parcels. Consequently, surveyors create disparate surveys by using local origins. It is here being advocated for extension and densification of our controls to our rural areas. Also, reviewing and updating the present legislations to legally incorporate the use of these new technologies. Again, the practicing surveyors should become disposed to the ne...|$|R
40|$|The {{cadastral}} {{system is}} the basis used {{for the protection of}} the property by means of title registration and <b>cadastral</b> <b>plans.</b> Each parcel and its owners are registered and all the spatial structures consisting of location, boundaries and contents are described in a cadastral map. Therefore, the cadastral system is seen as a land information system affording information on real estate of a property. It improves the land management whether in urban or rural areas. In urban area, it is becoming a fundamental framework for planing, assessment and collection of rates and taxes. In rural areas, the claim to ownership increases the investment in agricultural lands and the property business. Then an appropriate cadastral system should be designed and established by and for a particular country. One of the important components of any cadastral {{system is the}} cadastral map. But the existing systems consisting of paper maps and conventional land registers are becoming inefficient. For that reason, a Cadastral Information System (CIS), based on digital cadastral map in which attributes and map data on cadastral unit are stored in the same database, should be introduced. The CIS should be designed to support not only th...|$|R
