Appearance of choroidal <b>circulatory</b> <b>disturbance</b> {{was divided into}} two types. The type 1 showed choroidal filling delay at late retinal venous phase. The type 2 showed mosaic pattern of choroidal background at late retinal venous phase. Among the 126 eyes, 3 eyes were type 1 (2. 4 %) and 57 eyes were type 2 (45. 2 %), totaling 60 eyes (47. 6 %). Sixty-three eyes with normal part of branch retinal vein occlusion matching in sex and age were selected as controls. In the controls, no eye was type 1 (0 %) and 8 eyes were type 2 (12. 7 %), totaling 8 eyes (12. 7 %). Distinctly, proportion of the type 2 was higher in central serous chorioretinopathy than in branch retinal vein occlusion.

40|$|In {{cerebral}} circulation, {{there are}} many detailed reports of arterial <b>circulatory</b> <b>disturbance</b> but few reports of venous <b>circulatory</b> <b>disturbance.</b> In Experiment Ⅰ, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and intracranial pressure (ICP) response to transient superior sagittal sinus (SSS) occlusion were measured in twenty-one anesthetized cats. Cats were divided into three groups according to the duration of SSS occlusion (1, 3, 6 hours). Irreversible changes, such as no recovery of rCBF, thrombosed parenchymal vessel, and loss of nouronal cell, were observed in groups with more than 3 hours' occlusion. Consequently it was suspected that the time limit of transient cerebral venous occlusion was 3 hours. In Experiment Ⅱ, diameter of pial vessels and ICP response to complete cerebral venous occlusion were measured continuously in thirty anesthetized cats. 0. 3 ml of cyanoacrylate were injected into anterior SSS to occlude the SSS and cortical veins. Six hours after injection the state of blood-brain-barrier disruption and pathological changes were evaluated. As for the response of pial arterioles in early stages, 2 - 24 % contraction of arteriole was observed in fifteen cats and 2 - 16 % dilatation was observed in six cats. In later stages, 1 - 87 % dilatation of arteriole was observed in ten cats. The elevation of ICP and dilatation of arteriole were observed in the same period. Pathologically intracerebral hematoma (ICH) was observed in eight cats. These {{were all in the}} white matter of suprasylvian gyrus. In all ICH cases, two marginal veins surrounding the gyrus were occluded by cyanoacrylate. The dominant mechanism of CBF control is metabolic, not myogenic. According to this theory, the contraction of arteriole cannot be explained. This suggests that pial arterioles contract on very high venous pressure (transmural pressure). Consequently it was suspected that with very high venous pressure, more than 30 - 100 mmHg, the dominant mechanism is myogenic.

Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with technetium- 99 m-ethyl cysteinate dimer (Tc- 99 m ECD) revealed decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the bilateral thalami, bilateral medial frontal lobes, and left temporal lobe {{in addition to the}} cerebellar vermis and both cerebellar hemispheres when mutism was manifest, indicating the existence of bilateral crossed cerebello-cerebral diaschisis (BCCCD). <b>Circulatory</b> <b>disturbance</b> in both cerebellar hemispheres secondary to tumor resection probably caused BCCCD in both cerebral hemispheres, predominantly in the left, via the dentatothalamocortical pathway (DTCP). With recovery of his mutism, CBF increased in the right thalamus, bilateral medial frontal lobes and left temporal lobe. Thus BCCCD was improved, with only a slight decrease in CBF still persisting in the left thalamus. The mechanism of mutism may have involved damage to the cerebellar vermis (the site of incision at operation), the left dentate nucleus (heavily infiltrated by the tumor) and the right dentate nucleus of the cerebellum (affected by <b>circulatory</b> <b>disturbance</b> secondary to acute postoperative edema).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to clarify the {{existence}} of peripheral <b>circulatory</b> <b>disturbances</b> of upper extremities in sarcoidosis. Material of this study consisted of 30 cases of sarcoidosis and 30 cases of sex- and age -matched healthy human beings as controls. The method of the study is cold water test immersing both hands in 5 ℃ water for 5 minutes. After this cold load, the recovery was assessed in process of time by means of thermography, plethysmography and 133 Xe clearance test.

Design: Observational clinical study. Participants: Sixteen patients with a CRAO (16 eyes). Methods: The <b>circulatory</b> <b>disturbance</b> in eyes with CRAO was graded as mild (group 1) when the arm-to-retina transmission time was &lt; 30 sec and severe (group 2) when the arm-to-retina transmission time was &ge; 30 sec. Scotopic and photopic ERG components in eyes with CRAO were compared with those in healthy fellow eyes with respect to the degree of circulation disturbance. Results: The scotopic and photopic b-waves were significantly reduced only in group 2, whereas the amplitudes of the photopic negative response (PhNR) of the photopic cone ERGs were significantly reduced in both groups. The amplitudes of each ERG component, except for the a-wave of the mixed rod-cone ERG, were significantly smaller in group 2 than in group 1.
