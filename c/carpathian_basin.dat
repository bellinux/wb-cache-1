5|$|Both the {{scarcity}} of published archaeological material and the misdating of some sites {{may have contributed to}} the low number of archaeological sites that can be attributed to the Hungarians in the steppes, according to archaeologist László Kovács. Kovács also says that the Hungarians' migration from the steppes and their settlement in the <b>Carpathian</b> <b>Basin</b> may have caused the development of a new material culture, rendering the identification of pre-conquest Hungarians difficult. Archaeological research has demonstrated that the material culture of the Avars and other steppe peoples who settled in the <b>Carpathian</b> <b>Basin</b> before the Hungarians experienced a similarly significant change after they left the steppes and settled in their new homeland.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarians {{adopted the}} ancient (Celtic, Dacian or Germanic) {{names of the}} longest rivers in the <b>Carpathian</b> <b>Basin</b> from a Slavic-speaking population. For instance, the Hungarian names of the rivers Danube (Duna), Dráva, Garam, Maros, Olt, Száva, Tisza and Vág were {{borrowed}} from Slavs. The Hungarians also adopted {{a great number of}} hydronyms of Slavic origin, including Balaton ("swamp"), Beszterce ("swift river"), Túr ("aurochs' stream") and Zagyva ("sooty river"). Place names of Slavic origin abound across the <b>Carpathian</b> <b>Basin.</b> For instance, Csongrád ("black fortress"), Nógrád ("new fortress"), Visegrád ("citadel") and other early medieval fortresses bore a Slavic name, while the name of Keszthely preserved the Latin word for fortress (castellum) with Slavic mediation.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological finds {{from the}} <b>Carpathian</b> <b>Basin</b> provide {{evidence}} of the crafts practiced by the Magyars. 10th-century warriors' graves yielding sabres, arrow-heads, spear-heads, stirrups, and snaffle bits made of iron show that blacksmiths had a pre-eminent role in the militarized Magyar society. Engraved or gilded sabres and sabretache platesoften decorated with precious stonesand golden or silver pectoral disks evidence {{the high levels of}} skills of Magyar gold- and silversmiths. Cemeteries in the <b>Carpathian</b> <b>Basin</b> also yielded scraps of canvas made of flax or hemp. The positioning of metal buttons in the graves shows the Magyars wore clothes that either opened down the front or were fastened at the neck. Ear-rings were the only accessories worn above the belt by Magyar warriors; jewelry on their upper bodies would have hindered them from firing arrows. In contrast, Magyar women wore head jewelry decorated with leaf-like pendants, ear-rings, decorated pectoral disks, and rings with gemstones.|$|E

40|$|The Jurassic {{history of}} the Pieniny/Outer <b>Carpathian</b> <b>basins</b> {{reflects}} {{the evolution of the}} Circum-Tethyan area, especially its Alpine Tethys part. The Alpine Tethys that is Ligurian, Penninic Oceans and Pieniny/Magura Basin constitute the extension of the Central Atlantic system. The synrift stage lasted in the Pieniny/Magura Basin from late Early Jurassic to Tithonian (the Magura Unit constitutes the southernmost part of the Outer Flysch Carpathians). The Pieniny rift opened during Pliensbachian – Aalenian. The central Atlantic and Alpine Tethys went into a drifting stage during the Middle Jurassic. The Late Jurassic (Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian) {{history of the}} Pieniny/Magura Basin reflects strongest facial differentiation within sedimentary basin where mixed siliceous-carbonate sedimentation took place. Greatest deepening effect is indicated by widespread Oxfordian radiolarites, which occur in the all basinal successions, whereas the shallowest zone is completely devoid of siliceous intercalations at that time (sedimentation from Ammonitico Rosso facies up to coral reef limestone). The southern part of the North European Platform, north from the Pieniny/Magura realm, started to be rifted during Late Jurassic time and Silesian Basin in the Outer Western <b>Carpathians</b> and Sinaia <b>Basin</b> in the Eastern Carpathians, with black, mainly redeposited marls have been created. The outer sub-basins were differentiated during the latest (Hauterivian-Barremian) phase of basinal development. The connection of Silesian Basin with Sinaia and Southern Carpathian Severin areas suggests the NW-SE direction of the basinal axis while the orientation of the Pieniny Klippen Belt/Magura Basin was SW-NE so, two Outer Carpathian perpendicular directions are possible within the basins. Major reorganization happened during the Tithonian-Berriasian time. It was reflected by both paleoceanographical and paleoclimatical changes. The Neo-Cimmerian tectonic events as well as main phase of the Outer <b>Carpathian</b> <b>basins</b> opening is connected with this reorganization.  </p...|$|R

40|$|Several {{sections}} {{record the}} relation between the "black flysch" and Upper Cretaceous red shales in the Grajcarek thrust-sheets. In all the sections studied the "black flysch" appears in the core of imbricated folds or thrust-sheets, whereas the limbs are composed of Upper Cretaceous deposits. The transitional beds between the "black flysch" and the Upper Cretaceous red shales are composed of green and black bituminous shales, green and red radiolarites and cherty limestones. Biostratigraphical investigations have revealed a similar type and sequence of microfauna assemblages in all the sections studied and significant redeposition of Jurassic calcareous benthic foraminifera, calcareous nannoplankton, molluscs, sponge spicules and crinoid elements. The Cretaceous age (Aptian/Albian-Cenomanian) of the "black flysch" is shown by the presence of agglutinated foraminifera and microfacies data. These deposits are underlain by a Kimmeridgian-Aptian radiolarite/limestone condensed succession and overlain by Turonian-Campanian hemipelagic red shales and Maastrichtian/Lower Paleocene conglomerates and thick-bedded silicilastic turbidites of the Jarmuta Formation.

40|$|We use {{ambient noise}} {{tomography}} {{to investigate the}} crust and uppermost mantle structure beneath the Carpathian-Pannonian region of Central Europe. Over 7500 Rayleigh wave empirical Green's functions are derived from interstation cross-correlations of vertical component ambient seismic noise recordings (2005 - 2011) using a temporary network of 54 stations deployed during the South Carpathian Project (2009 - 2011), 56 temporary stations deployed in the <b>Carpathian</b> <b>Basins</b> Project (2005 - 2007) and 100 permanent and regional broad-band stations. Rayleigh wave group velocity dispersion curves (4 - 40 s) are determined using the multiple-filter analysis technique.

40|$|The {{study focused}} on the {{chemistry}} of detrital garnet and tourmaline from sediments of the Boryslav and Kliva Sandstone types in the Oligocene part of the Menilite Formation of the Skole Nappe (Western Outer Carpathians, Poland), with regard to provenance. Almandine and almandine-pyrope compositional varieties {{are the most common}} garnets, with minor almandine-pyrope-grossular garnet. Scarce garnet grains, with grossular and spessartine as the dominant end-members, are also present. The tourmaline belongs to the alkali tourmaline principal group and represents the schörl-dravite series. The detrital garnet and tourmaline display strong, compositional similarities to minerals, occurring in igneous and metamorphic rocks of the Bohemian Massif, as well as to detrital grains, deposited within the internal basins of the massif. This suggests that the primary rocks for the garnet and tourmaline may be crystalline complexes of the Bohemian Massif. However, other uplifted areas, similar to the complexes of the Bohemian Massif, cannot be ruled out. Such hypothetical areas could be located in the northern foreland of the <b>Carpathian</b> <b>basins.</b> Euhedral tourmaline and other minerals, occurring in the heavy- mineral assemblages studied, most probably were derived from eroded and presently not exposed, crystalline complexes, originally situated in the Skole Basin foreland or within the basin...|$|R

5|$|Their {{conquest of}} the <b>Carpathian</b> <b>Basin</b> is the {{principal}} subject of the Gesta Hungarorum.

5|$|According to Béla Miklós Szőke's theory, the {{detailed}} description of the Magyars by western contemporary sources and the immediate Hungarian intervention in local wars give the presumption that the Hungarians had already lived on the eastern territories of the <b>Carpathian</b> <b>Basin</b> since the middle of the 9th century. Regarding the right location of early Hungarian settlements, the Arabic geographer al-Jayhani (only snippets of his work survived in other Muslim authors' papers) in the 870s placed the Hungarians between Don and Danube rivers.

40|$|The {{taxonomy}} and biostratigraphy of deep-water agglutinated foraminifera (DWAF) {{are documented}} in a 299 m thick section {{collected from the}} Upper Cretaceous (Turonian to Maastrichtian) of the Scaglia Bianca and Scaglia Rossa Formations in the Contessa Highway section of Italy. A total of 94 species belonging to 48 genera are documented from the section, including two new species: Subreophax longicameratus n. sp., and Hormosinella fusiformis n. sp [...] The DWAF assemblages display a general trend of increasing abundance and diversity from the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary to the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary. The biostratigraphy of DWAF in the Upper Cretaceous part of the Contessa Highway section is calibrated to the 2008 ICS timescale {{by means of the}} calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy. Nine calcareous nannofossil biozones are determined in the interval CC 10 to CC 26, but some of the Upper Cretaceous nannofossil biozones could not be determined owing to poor preservation or the absence of index taxa. The first occurrences of biostratigraphically important DWAF species are compared with the first occurrences in the Upper Cretaceous of the Carpathians and the North Atlantic. The agglutinated foraminiferal biozones of the Carpathian schemes of Geroch & Nowak (1984) and Neagu et al. (1992) and the North Atlantic zonation of Kuhnt et al. (1992) cannot be applied in their entirety to the Contessa Highway section owing to the scarcity of some index taxa. Four Upper Cretaceous DWAF biozones described from the Atlantic and Western Tethys are recognised in the Scaglia formations at Contessa: the lower Turonian Bulbobaculites problematicus Zone, the upper Turonian to Coniacian Uvigerinammina jankoi Zone, the Santonian to Campanian Caudammina gigantea Zone, and the Maastrichtian Remesella varians Zone. However, some of the cosmopolitan index taxa, such as Bulbobaculites problematicus and Uvigerinammina jankoi have truncated stratigraphic ranges. The oligotrophic palaeoenvironmental conditions represented by the red deep-water Scaglia Rossa limestones cause flysch-type species such as Uvigerinammina jankoi and Caudammina gigantea to be rare, {{and in the case of}} Rectoprotomarssonella rugosa, an index species for the Lower Campanian, to be absent. Nevertheless, the Uvigerinammina jankoi Zone in Contessa can be correlated with the <b>Carpathian</b> <b>Basins</b> and the North Atlantic. Agglutinated foraminiferal assemblages are similar in taxonomic composition to those of the <b>Carpathian</b> <b>Basins</b> but in addition, a series of small abyssal type Haplophragmoides species known from the North Atlantic DSDP/ODP sites are present in the Contessa Highway section, probably as a result of oligotrophic conditions in the central Tethys. The abundance of agglutinated foraminifera at Contessa displays mimima during sea level high stands in the late Turonian, late Coniacian, late Santonian, early Campanian. These low abundance assemblages likely indicate enhanced oligotrophy as result of sediment starvation. The foraminiferal abundance and diversity values generally increase upsection, and typical "flysch-type" species appear in the record, indicating more detrital influx and a change to more mesotrophic conditions in the Campanian...|$|R

5|$|At {{the onset}} of the Quaternary glacial cycles, around 2.6 mya, the extant Triturus species had already emerged.

From there, they recolonised the northern parts after glacial retreat. The study also showed that species range boundaries shifted, with some species replacing others during recolonisation, for example the southern marbled newt which expanded northwards and replaced the marbled newt.
