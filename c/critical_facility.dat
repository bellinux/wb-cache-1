25|$|Frustrated by poor {{conditions}} such as insufficient textbooks and dilapidated facilities during the late 1990s, students at Balboa became members of the class-action lawsuit Williams v. California. Filed in 2000 by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against the State of California, the suit alleged a failure to provide adequate facilities, textbooks, and teachers for the poorest schools in the state. The case was named after Eliezer Williams, a middle school student age 12 at the time, who {{would go on to}} graduate from Balboa. The lawsuit was resolved in 2004, with the administration of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger agreeing to provide US$138 million for instructional material, US$50 million for <b>critical</b> <b>facility</b> repairs at nearly 2,400 state schools, and to reimburse school districts for future repairs of deficient facilities. Estimates indicate California may be liable for up to US$1 billion in reimbursements over several years.|$|E

50|$|On June 30, 1950, {{the airport}} was officially renamed Merrill C. Meigs Field.

Daley), runway lengthening, and the late 1990s charting of two FAA instrument approaches allowing landings in poor weather conditions. By the 1970s Meigs Field became a <b>critical</b> <b>facility</b> for aeromedical transport of patients and transplant organs to downtown hospitals as medical transportation technology modernized.

5000|$|Bernstein had benefited {{greatly from}} his {{participation}} in Sid Grossman's workshops and sought to emulate his teacher's approach. The first thing was for his students to enjoy themselves when they were out photographing. However, Bernstein made some important refinements to the workshop methodology. Students were expected to bring in their work for criticism. But whereas Grossman could be sarcastic and biting in his approach, (“Sid never told me what was good. He only told me what was bad...”) Bernstein was always gentle. Any photograph, no matter how amateurish, was a [...] "stepping stone" [...] for something better. In addition, Bernstein encouraged his students to express their own opinions about each other's work - usually before he gave his own evaluation. His stated purpose was to encourage his students to encourage each other, rather than be in competition. By talking about other photographers' work, each student was developing his own <b>critical</b> <b>facility</b> - essential to his own development as a photographer. Just as Grossman continued to teach privately after he left The Photo League in 1949, so too, Bernstein conducted weekly sessions from his home for many years. In 1992, Bernstein estimated that he had worked with over 600 students.In addition to the informal workshops he conducted, Bernstein also taught formally at various institutions. In 1971, when W. Eugene Smith took a sabbatical from his teaching position at Cooper Union, he recommended that Bernstein take his place. Smith had previously recommended him for a Guggenheim grant in a [...] "Confidential Report on Candidate for Fellowship" [...] from Dec. 1969, as had Wynn Bullock in a letter dated Nov. 17, 1966. The following year, Bernstein taught a similar class, “Creative Approach to Photography,” at the Phoenix School for Art and Design. After he had spent years photographing at the New York Aquarium at Coney Island, {{he was asked to}} share some of what he had learned in a course entitled “Aquatic Awareness,” which he conducted from 1980-1985. [...] He also authored a column entitled “Critique” in the magazine Camera 35 from 1968-1973, which enabled him to reach a wider audience throughout the United States.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Electrical {{power supply}} to serve <b>critical</b> <b>facilities</b> are of high {{importance}} in today’s world. Instead {{of building a}} large electric power system, an intelligent Micro Grid (MG) {{can be considered as}} a promising power supply alternative for those <b>critical</b> <b>facilities.</b> This study presents the development and controlling of a laboratory scale MG which consists of several Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) such as Solar PV, Diesel Generator, Micro Hydro model, Battery Bank with a bidirectional inverter and critical and non-critical loads. Controlling of the MG is done by using distributed autonomous control strategies and Multi Agent System Architectures. It can operate in a grid connected mode as well as autonomous mode when it is isolated. The whole system was simulated using MATLAB and the simulation results and practical results were compared when MG is operated in different scenarios. The effectiveness of this controlling method is discussed in this paper...|$|R
