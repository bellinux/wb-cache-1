25|$|The show {{is set in}} the {{newsroom}} of a television station which is never officially named, but is generally understood to be based on CBC's own Toronto affiliate <b>CBLT.</b> Inspired by American series The Larry Sanders Show and similar to such earlier series as the British Drop the Dead Donkey and the Australian Frontline, the series mined a dark vein of comedy from the political machinations and the sheer incompetence of the people involved in producing the fictional City Hour, the station's nightly newscast.|$|E
25|$|The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) {{adopted the}} American NTSC 525-line B/W 60 field per second system as its {{broadcast}} standard. It began television broadcasting in Canada in September 1952. The first broadcast was on September 6, 1952 from its Montreal station CBFT. The premiere broadcast was bilingual, spoken in English and French. Two days later, on September 8, 1952, the Toronto station <b>CBLT</b> {{went on the}} air. This became the English-speaking flagship station for the country, while CBFT became the French-language flagship after a second English-language station was licensed to CBC in Montreal later in the decade. The CBC's first privately owned affiliate television station, CKSO in Sudbury, Ontario, launched in October 1953 (at the time, all private stations were expected to affiliate with the CBC, a condition that was relaxed in 1960–61 when CTV, Canada's second national English-language network, was formed).|$|E
500|$|Canadian {{television}} {{was in its}} infancy in 1952 when Toronto's <b>CBLT</b> paid $7,500 {{for the rights to}} carry the first televised broadcast of a Grey Cup game. Within two years, it was estimated that 80 percent of the nation's 900,000 television sets were tuned into the game, even though the first national telecast did not occur until 1957. The Grey Cup continues to be one of Canada's most-viewed sporting events. The 1962 [...] "Fog Bowl" [...] game was the first Grey Cup to be broadcast on American television.|$|E
50|$|On September 2, 2013, CBET Windsor {{expanded}} its early evening newscast to 90 minutes from 5:30 to 7pm, while its 11pm newscast {{was replaced by}} <b>CBLT's</b> newscast at that time, differing from most CBC O&Os in other markets where the station carries both an early and late evening newscast of its own. Asha Tomlinson became anchor of the expanded newscast, replacing Amanda Ferguson, who became anchor during Susan Pedler's maternity leave.|$|R
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1995, {{according}} to BBM Canada, <b>CBLT's</b> evening newscast CBC Evening News had a total audience of 117,000 viewers in the Toronto-Hamilton market, putting it in fourth place behind Global News on CIII at 141,000, CITY's CityPulse at 229,000, and CFTO's World Beat News at 409,000. Only CHCH (channel 11), the only other station based in the Toronto-Hamilton market with a 6:00 p.m. newscast, had lower viewership at 77,000 viewers.|$|R
5000|$|Bruce Rogers is a Canadian {{broadcast}} journalist, {{author and}} politician. Rogers {{is best known}} for his work as a television host on TVOntario and as a radio broadcaster on CBC Radio and CFRB in Toronto.Rogers worked from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation from the 1960s through the 1980s and was the first host of CBC Radio Toronto's Metro Morning from 1973 to 1974. He also hosted Radio Noon, Sunday Magazine, [...] The World at Six as well as numerous hourly news bulletins. On television, he hosted <b>CBLT's</b> The Rogers Report as well as various newscasts. His work on TVO has included hosting a number of finance-oriented shows such as Money$worth and Money$ense.|$|R
2500|$|Television {{broadcasts}} {{from the}} CBC began on September 6, 1952, {{with the opening}} of a station in Montreal, Quebec (CBFT), and a station in Toronto, Ontario (<b>CBLT)</b> opening two days later. The CBC's first privately owned affiliate television station, CKSO in Sudbury, Ontario, launched in October 1953. (At the time, all private stations were expected to affiliate with the CBC, a condition that relaxed in 1960–61 with the launch of CTV.) ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Nielsen Media Research, the Buffalo {{television}} {{market is}} the 52nd largest in the United States [...] Although no major cable outlets have offices or bureaus in the Buffalo area, the four major networks have established affiliates in the area: WGRZ 2 (NBC), WIVB-TV 4 (CBS), WUTV 29 (FOX), and WKBW-TV 7 (ABC). Other stations in Buffalo with network affiliations include publicly funded WNED-TV 17 (PBS), WNLO 23 (The CW), WNYO-TV 49 (MyNetworkTV), and WBBZ-TV 67 (MeTV/independent). The area's major cable provider is Spectrum, which operates the system-exclusive Spectrum News Buffalo, part of the statewide Spectrum News network. The Buffalo market also has access to multiple Canadian broadcast stations over-the-air from the Hamilton and Toronto areas, though only <b>CBLT</b> 5 (CBC) and CFTO 9 (CTV) are carried on Time Warner Cable.|$|E
2500|$|Most CBC {{television}} stations, {{including those}} in the major cities, are {{owned and operated by}} the CBC itself. CBC O stations operate as a mostly seamless national service with few deviations from the main network schedule, although there are some regional differences from time to time. For on-air identification, most CBC stations use the CBC brand rather than their call letters, not identifying themselves specifically until sign-on or sign-off (though some, like Toronto's <b>CBLT,</b> do not ID themselves at all except through PSIP). All CBC O stations have a standard call letter naming convention, in that the first two letters are [...] "CB" [...] (an ITU prefix allocated not to Canada, but to Chile) and the last letter is [...] "T". Only the third letter varies from market to market; however, that letter is typically the same as the third letter of the CBC Radio One and CBC Radio 2 stations in the same market. An exception to this rule are the CBC North stations in Yellowknife, Whitehorse and Iqaluit, whose call signs begin with [...] "CF" [...] due to their historic association with the CBC's Frontier Coverage Package prior to the advent of microwave and satellite broadcasting.|$|E
50|$|CBLT-DT {{currently}} broadcasts {{ten hours}} and 40 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with two hours on weekdays, a half-hour on Saturdays and ten minutes on Sundays); {{in regards to}} the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the lowest local newscast output out of any English-language television station in the immediate Toronto market and the second lowest among the stations in the expanded Toronto-Hamilton-Barrie market as a whole (behind CTV Two owned-and-operated station CKVR-DT, which airs seven hours of newscasts each week). <b>CBLT's</b> newscasts have consistently faced very stiff competition in the Toronto market, consistently rating behind CTV station CFTO since it surged to the number one spot in 1970, and behind CITY-TV (channel 57) since 1982.|$|R
50|$|In {{the latter}} case, {{the numbers are}} usually applied sequentially, {{starting}} from one and denoting the chronological order in which the station's rebroadcast transmitters began operation. Some broadcasters may, at their discretion, use {{a system in which}} the number denotes the actual broadcast channel of the transmitter (e.g., CJOH-TV-47 in Pembroke). A broadcaster cannot, however, mix the two numbering systems under a single call sign - the transmitters are either all numbered sequentially or all numbered by their analogue channel position. On the rare occasion that the sequential numbering reaches 99 (e.g., TVOntario's former broadcast transmitters), rather than being numbered as 100 the next transmitter is assigned a new call sign and numbered as one. Translators which share the same frequency (such as <b>CBLT's</b> former repeaters CBLET, CBLHT, CBLAT-2 and CH4113, all on channel 12) are also given distinct call signs.|$|R
2500|$|In Canada, Coronation Street is {{broadcast}} on CBC Television. Until 2011, episodes were shown in Canada approximately 10 months after they aired in Britain; however, {{beginning in the}} fall of 2011, the CBC began showing two episodes every weekday, in order {{to catch up with the}} ITV showings, at 6:30pm and 7pm local time Monday-Friday, with an omnibus on Sundays at 7.30am. By May 2014, the CBC was only two weeks behind Britain, so the show was reduced to a single showing weeknights at 6:30pm local time. The show debuted on Toronto's <b>CBLT</b> in July 1966. The 2002 edition of the Guinness Book of Records recognises the 1,144 episodes sold to the now-defunct CBC-owned Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, TV station CBKST by Granada TV on 31 May 1971 to be the largest number of TV shows ever purchased in one transaction. The show traditionally aired on weekday afternoons in Canada, with a Sunday morning omnibus. [...] In 2004, CBC moved the weekday airings from their daytime slot to prime time. In light of austerity measures imposed on the CBC in 2012, which includes further cutbacks on non-Canadian programming, one of the foreign shows to remain on the CBC schedule is Coronation Street, according to the CBC's director of content planning Christine Wilson, who commented: [...] "Unofficially I can tell you Coronation Street is coming back. If it didn't come back, something would happen on Parliament Hill." [...] Kirstine Stewart, the head of the CBC's English-language division, once remarked: [...] "Coronation Street fans are the most loyal, except maybe for curling viewers, of all CBC viewers," [...] In late September 2014, CBC aired extra episodes to become only one week behind the UK in airing of new episodes.|$|E
50|$|Once the CN Tower in Toronto was {{completed}} in 1976, atop which CBC flagship <b>CBLT</b> (channel 5) transmits from, the signal coverage areas of CKVR and <b>CBLT</b> overlapped considerably.

5000|$|A [...] "Save Our Station" [...] {{committee}} was formed and politicians {{on every level}} lobbied both CBC and the Canadian government to preserve the Windsor operation. Only three reporters remained at CBET, who produced stories for the early evening newscast on Toronto sister station <b>CBLT.</b> First came 5:30 Live, which was followed by CBC Evening News with Bill Cameron (which earlier was known as CBC at 6 on <b>CBLT).</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>CBLT</b> {{has used}} a variety of on-air brands since its inception. From 1957 to 1972, it was known as [...] "Channel 6". Following its move to channel 5 in 1972, it rebranded as [...] "CBLT Five", later {{simplifying}} it to [...] "CBLT/5". In the late 1970s, the station was branded as [...] "Toronto/5". During the 1980s, it was known mainly as CBLT-TV, although it used a [...] "CBC 5" [...] logo. Starting on January 1, 1986, the station was identified in print ads as [...] "CBC Television Toronto/5", but the <b>CBLT</b> name was used for its local programs including its supper hour newscast <b>CBLT</b> Newshour. By the 1990s, it was known simply as [...] "CBC Toronto", although the <b>CBLT</b> calls were used {{from time to time in}} local programming, and on the CBC website. As with most Canadian television stations, the use of the analogue channel placement was phased out of the station's logo and advertising, as most cable placements did not match up with its VHF frequency.|$|E

50|$|On September 10, 1984, <b>CBLT</b> debuted one of {{the only}} locally {{produced}} morning television programs in Canada, <b>CBLT</b> Morning, which aired weekdays from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. The programme was co-hosted by Dale Goldhawk and Leslie Jones, with news reported by Kevin Marsh. At the time of the programme's cancellation on April 4, 1986, it was watched by 20,000 viewers, more than the Canadian viewership of ABC's Good Morning America, but less than that of CTV's Canada AM.|$|E

50|$|In 1956, <b>CBLT</b> {{moved to}} VHF channel 6 and {{increased}} its {{effective radiated power}} from 25 to 100 kW. The change in frequency was made to accommodate the eventual licensing of a second privately owned local station for Toronto, which eventually became CFTO (channel 9) when that station was licensed {{at the end of}} 1960. Then in 1972, <b>CBLT</b> relocated to channel 5 in order to allow two new stations - CKGN (now CIII-DT) in Paris and a repeater of Ottawa-based CJOH in Deseronto - to use channel 6.|$|E
50|$|In 1961, CHCH disaffiliated {{itself from}} the CBC and became an {{independent}} station. There were three reasons for disaffiliating from CBC: Hamilton {{is part of the}} Toronto market, and Toronto-based CBC flagship <b>CBLT</b> already provided full network service to some of CHCH's viewing area; <b>CBLT</b> was about to increase its transmitter power and change frequencies (from VHF channel 9 to channel 6, and eventually channel 5), resulting in a near-100 percent overlap with CHCH; and the station's managers wanted to produce more local programming, instead of being forced to carry CBC programming.|$|E
50|$|WHAM-TV {{moved to}} channel 5 on July 24, 1954, {{as part of}} a {{revision}} of upstate New York's VHF allotments resulting from the Federal Communications Commission's Sixth Report and Order of 1952. However, WHAM-TV on channel 5 dealt with interference issues from <b>CBLT,</b> a CBC Television station from Toronto, after that station moved from its original channel 9 allocation to channel 6 in 1956. <b>CBLT</b> was replaced on channel 9 by CFTO-TV in 1960, and that channel relocation would later play an indirect role in the station's second frequency shift, eight years later.|$|E
