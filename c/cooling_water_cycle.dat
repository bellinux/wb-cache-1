40|$|Water cooling {{utilizing}} {{natural waters}} is typically used for cooling large industrial facilities such as power plants. The cooling water cycles {{are susceptible to}} biofouling and scaling, which may reduce heat transfer capacity and enhance corrosion. The performance of two fouling-release coatings combined with hypochlorite treatment were studied in a power plant utilizing brackish sea water from the Baltic Sea for cooling. The effect of hypochlorite as an antifouling biocide on material performance and species composition of microfouling formed on coated surfaces was studied {{during the summer and}} autumn. Microfouling on surfaces of the studied fouling-release coatings was intensive in the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>cycle</b> during the warm summer months. As in most cases in a natural water environment the fouling consisted of both inorganic fouling and biofouling. Chlorination decreased the bacterial number on the surfaces by 10 – 1000 fold, but the efficacy depended on the coating. In addition to decreasing the bacterial number, the chlorination also changed the microbial species composition, forming the biofilm on the surfaces of two fouling-release coatings. TeknoTar coating was proven to be more efficient in combination with the hypochlorite treatment against microfouling under these experimental conditions...|$|E

40|$|Cooling systems remove {{heat from}} {{components}} and industrial equipment. <b>Water</b> <b>cooling,</b> employing natural <b>waters,</b> is typically used for cooling large industrial facilities, such as power plants, factories or refineries. Due to moderate temperatures, <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>cycles</b> {{are susceptible to}} biofouling, inorganic fouling and scaling, which may reduce heat transfer and enhance corrosion. Hypochlorite treatment or antifouling coatings are used to prevent biological fouling in these systems. In this research, we examine biofouling and materials’ degradation in a brackish seawater environment using a range of test materials, both uncoated and coated. The fouling and corrosion resistance of titanium alloy (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V), super austenitic stainless steel (254 SMO) and epoxy-coated carbon steel (Intershield Inerta 160) were studied in the absence and presence of hypochlorite. Our results demonstrate that biological fouling is intensive in cooling systems using brackish seawater in sub-arctic areas. The microfouling comprised a vast diversity of bacteria, archaea, fungi, algae and protozoa. Chlorination was effective against biological fouling: up to a 10 – 1000 -fold decrease in bacterial and archaeal numbers was detected. Chlorination also changed {{the diversity of the}} biofilm-forming community. Nevertheless, our results also suggest that chlorination enhances cracking of the epoxy coating...|$|R

In order to evaluate this effect, a cone with ribs inside {{the upper part}} is picked up. A spiral-cooling channel is fabricated along the side surface of the mold core and also between the ribs in the upper part. To compare with this, a steel mold with machined baffle channels was made. The diameter of {{the upper part of}} the molded cone was chosen as an evaluation dimension. The temperature on the upper surface of the core is kept low at around the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> temperature in the case of sintered mold during the cycle of the injection. On the other hand, the temperature on the upper surface of the steel mold increases far higher than the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> temperature. <b>Cycle</b> time for the same shrink ratio in {{the upper part of the}} molded cone was 25 s in the sintered mold and 40 s in the steel mold.

The mixtures were either prepared in the laboratory or taken directly from a mixing plant. The study compared the rutting and fatigue behaviours of unaged material in comparison to long term laboratory aged material. In order to conduct the long term ageing, a special laboratory ageing protocol with different heating, <b>cooling</b> and <b>watering</b> <b>cycles</b> had been developed. The investigation revealed a quite controversial rutting behavior {{which could not be}} explained with the available data.

The device served two major functions: it facilitated pressure recovery and improved the mixing between the weak solution and the refrigerant vapour coming from the evaporator. These effects enhanced the absorption of the refrigerant vapour into the solution drops. To facilitate {{the design of the}} jet ejector for such absorption machines, a numerical model of simultaneous heat-and-mass transfers between the liquid and the gas phases in the ejector was developed. The refrigerant pentafluoroethane (R 125) and the absorbent N,N'-dimethylethylurea (DMEU) were used as the working fluid. A computerized simulation program was used to perform a parametric study of the TPL absorption cycle. The influence of the jet ejector on the performance of the TPL absorption cycle was evaluated, and the performance of the TPL absorption cycle was compared with that of a double-pressure level (DPL) cycle. Four cases were studied that represent the improvements in the TPL absorption cycle performances {{as a result of the}} incorporation of the jet ejector.

40|$|Tumble dryers {{and drying}} {{cabinets}} have {{to a large}} extent replaced the traditional way of drying clothes outdoors. They are faster, more convenient, require less space and can be operated regardless of weather conditions. This replacement has significantly increased residential energy consumption, {{due to the fact that}} tumbles dryers consume large amounts of electrical energy. In the USA 9 % of the households electric energy is consumed when drying clothes. Over 4 million tumble dryers are sold in Europe each year and 20 % of the residential electricity consumption in Sweden is used drying and washing clothes. Tumble dryers are also utilized in the industrial sector, but industrial dryers are not considered in this study. Increasing energy costs contributes to the public’s awareness and desire to cut their energy consumption. The aim of this study is to increase the energy efficiency and drastically reduce electric power use of tumble dryers. There are two main types of tumble dryers available on the market; the open cycle tumble dryer and the closed cycle tumble dryer. The open cycle tumble dryer is often attached to the ventilation system and thereby it evacuates its exhaust air. The closed cycle tumble dryer condenses the water from the air before it recirculates it. To increase the energy efficiency and reduce electric power use of tumble dryers, two separate studies were made. One on a <b>water</b> <b>cooled</b> closed <b>cycle</b> tumble dryer and one on a hot <b>water</b> heated open <b>cycle</b> tumble dryer. Both tumble dryers where rebuild and originated from the same tumble dryer. The tumble dryer that both studies originated from was a conventional air cooled closed cycle tumble dryer. The tumble dryer is made by Asko Cylinda AB. The results reveal that the <b>water</b> <b>cooled</b> closed <b>cycle</b> tumble dryer does not have greater energy efficiency than the conventional air cooled closed cycle tumble dryer. However the drying time was reduced by 37 %.

40|$|<b>Cooling</b> <b>water</b> {{systems are}} used to remove excess heat from a {{chemical}} process to the atmosphere. The primary components of these systems are the cooling tower and the heat exchanger network. There is a strong interaction between these individual components, thus their performances are interrelated. Most published {{research in this area}} has focused mainly on optimization of the individual components i. e. optimization of heat exchanger network or optimization of the cooling towers. This approach does not optimize the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> system as a whole. Previous research work in which a holistic approach was used is limited to <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> systems with single <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> source. This work presents a technique for integrated optimization of complex <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> systems. The system under consideration consists of multiple cooling towers each supplying a set of heat exchangers. A superstructural approach is employed to explore all possible combinations between the heat exchangers and the cooling towers. The <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> reuse opportunities within the heat exchanger networks are also explored. A detailed mathematical model consisting of the cooling towers and the heat exchanger networks model is developed. Two practical scenarios are considered and the mathematical formulations for Case I and II yield nonlinear programing (NLP) and mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) structure respectively. Although the reuse/recycle philosophy offers a good debottlenecking opportunity, the topology of the associated <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> network is more complex, hence prone to higher pressure drop than the conventional parallel design. This is due to an increased network pressure drop associated with additional reuse/recycle streams. Therefore, it is essential to consider pressure drop during the synthesis of <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> networks where the reuse/recycle philosophy is employed. The on-going research in this area is only limited to <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> networks consisting of a single <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> source. The common technique used is mathematical optimization using either superstructural or non superstructural approach. This work further presents a mathematical technique for pressure drop optimization in <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> systems consisting of multiple cooling towers. The proposed technique is based on the Critical Path Algorithm and the superstructural approach. The Critical Path Algorithm is used to select the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> network with minimum pressure drop whilst the superstructural approach allows for <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> reuse. The technique which was previously used in a <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> network with single source is modified and applied in a <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> network with multiple sources. The mathematical formulation is developed considering two cases. Both cases yield mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) models. The cooling tower model is also used to predict the exit condition of the cooling tower given the inlet conditions from the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> network model. The results show up to 29 % decrease in total circulating <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> flowrate when the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> system is debottlenecked without considering pressure drop. Consequently, the overall cooling towers effectiveness was improved by up to 5 %. When considering pressure drop the results showed up to 26 % decrease in total circulating water flowrate.

For this study, data log readings from compressor heat exchanger approach temperatures were used for energy saving calculations and equipment efficiency (scaling). Using conservation of energy principles and municipal power costs, {{it was found that}} over four years, R 425 991 was saved. Conventional chemical <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> treatment systems showed high approach temperatures, resulting in high scaling rates and high energy consumption in the compressors. In contrast, ozone <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> treatment systems showed a lower approach temperatures which resulted in lower scaling rates and lower energy consumption in the compressors. Also, for this study data log readings from <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> flow rates and weekly water quality analyses were used for water saving calculation and corrosion predictions. In ozone <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> treatment systems, there was a reduction in makeup water use confirming water savings. According to Mosugelo (2010) water quality is a bigger contributor to corrosion than ozone is. In <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> treatment systems with good quality makeup water, ozone treated systems were found to have lower corrosion rates in the heat exchangers than conventional chemicals systems.
