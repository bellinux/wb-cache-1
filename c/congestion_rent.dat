The electricity markets analyzed are: New York Power Pool, California Power Exchange, and Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland (PJM) power pool. The paper describes the significant assumptions underlying the calculations and attempts to delineate {{the implications of the}} assumptions. It is observed that the <b>congestion</b> <b>rent</b> calculations are practically accurate for the California Power Exchange since most of the data pertaining to the inter-zonal transmission power flow and the inter-zonal price differential is readily available. On the contrary, the <b>congestion</b> <b>rent</b> estimation for the New York ISO involves significant assumptions. However, it can be shown that the results are reasonably accurate. The efforts for the similar calculations for the <b>congestion</b> <b>rent</b> for PJM electricity power markets proved to be futile. It would not be unfair to comment that when compared to its peer electricity markets, PJM severely lacks transparency in terms of disclosing information pertaining to the transmission <b>congestion</b> <b>rent</b> calculations...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes two new methodologies for the {{placement}} of series FACTS devices in deregulated electricity market to reduce congestion. Similar to sensitivity factor based method, the proposed methods form a priority list that reduces the solution space. The proposed methodologies {{are based on the}} use of LMP differences and <b>congestion</b> <b>rent,</b> respectively. The methods are computationally efficient, since LMPs are the by-product of a security constrained OPF and <b>congestion</b> <b>rent</b> is a function of LMP difference and power flows. The proposed methodologies are tested and validated for locating TCSC in IEEE 14 -, IEEE 30 - and IEEE 57 -bus test systems. Results obtained with the proposed methods are compared with that of the sensitivity method and with exhaustive OPF solutions. The overall objective of FACTS device placement can be either to minimize the total <b>congestion</b> <b>rent</b> or to maximize the social welfare. Results show that the proposed methods are capable of finding the best location for TCSC installation, that suite both objectives...|$|E
40|$|This paper studies Cournot {{competition}} with two generators who share one transmission {{line with a}} limited capacity to supply price-taking consumers. In such a game the network operator needs a rule to allocate transmission capacity. Three rules are studied: all-or-nothing, proportional, and efficient rationing. The first result {{is that if the}} network operator taxes the whole <b>congestion</b> <b>rent,</b> the generators strategically change their production quantities, such that the network operator obtains no <b>congestion</b> <b>rent.</b> This gives poor incentives for investment in transmission capacity. The second result is that the network operator can create competition among the generators, which can increase welfare. Marginal nodal congestion pricing, which is optimal under perfect competition, is sub-optimal when generators can set their production quantities freely. It does not generate revenue for the network operator, nor does it increase competition among the generators. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} nature of electricity generation and delivery creates special {{problems for the}} design of efficient markets, notably the need to manage delivery in real time and the volatile congestion and associated costs that result. Proposals for the operation of the deregulated electricity industry tend towards one of two paradigms: centralized and decentralized. Transmission congestion management can be implemented in the more centralized point-to-point approach, a in New York state, where derivative transmission congestion contracts (TCCs) are traded, or in the more decentralized flowgate-based approach. While it is widely accepted that theoretically TCCs have attractive properties as hedging instruments against congestion cost uncertainty, whether efficient markets for them can be established in practice has been questioned. Based on an empirical analysis of publicly available data from years 2000 and 2001, it appears that New York TCCs provided marketparticipants with a potentially effective hedge against volatile <b>congestion</b> <b>rents.</b> However, the prices paid for TCCs systematically diverged from the resulting <b>congestion</b> <b>rents</b> for distant locations and at high prices. The price paid for the hedge not being in line with the <b>congestion</b> <b>rents,</b> i. e. unreasonably high risk premiums are being paid, suggests an inefficient market.

40|$|The use of {{transmission}} constrained unit commitment models to determine nodal energy prices in electricity markets is {{widely recognized as}} an efficient way implement electricity market that provide efficient pricing signals in the short term. However, complexities of unit commitment models arising from non-convexities in generation cost functions and network models can cause the absence of classical Walrasian equilibrium; {{this means that the}} unit commitment based dispatch model will not be able, under some situations, to find a single equilibrium price for which the energy market is cleared. Based on recent research on non-linear pricing for singlenode unit commitment models, this paper proposes a transmission constrained non-linear pricing alternative based coordination functions added to the classic decomposition Lagrangian relaxation algorithm to solve transmission constrained unit commitment models. The new coordination algorithms finds agent’s purchase and sell prices that coordinate the market in the absence of classic equilibrium. Since non-linear prices differ for each agent connected to a transmission node, the value of <b>congestion</b> <b>rents</b> is redefined so that the new pricing mechanism is taken in to account. The redefinition of <b>congestion</b> <b>rents</b> is necessary so that the implementation of financial transmission rights, in their varied forms, is still possible in order to provide a price hedging mechanism in the nodal spot market.

40|$|In the European market, the {{promotion}} of wind power leads to more network congestion. Zonal pricing (market coupling), which does not take the physical characteristics of transmission into account, is {{the most commonly used}} method to relieve congestion in Europe. Zonal pricing fails to provide adequate locational price signals regarding the energy resource scarcity and thus creates a large amount of unscheduled cross-border flows originating from wind-generated power, making the interconnected grid less secure. Prior studies show that full nodal pricing works better in integrating wind power into the grid. In this paper we investigate the effects of applying a hybrid congestion management model, i. e. nodal pricing model for one country embedded in a zonal pricing system {{for the rest of the}} market. We test how nodal pricing works in such a hybrid context with more wind power. We find that, compared to full nodal pricing, hybrid pricing fails to fully utilize all the resources in the network and some wrong price signals might be given. However, hybrid pricing still performs better than zonal pricing. The results from the hybrid pricing model of Poland, Germany, Slovakia and the Czech Republic show that, within the area applying nodal pricing (Poland), better price signals are given; the need for re-dispatching reduces; more <b>congestion</b> <b>rent</b> is collected and the unit cost of power is reduced. The results also show that international power exchange increases between the nodal pricing area and the zonal pricing areas, especially on windy days. Moreover, the nodal pricing area has less unscheduled crossborder power flow from the zonal pricing area entering its network and collects more cross-border <b>congestion</b> <b>rent...</b>|$|E

40|$|Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs) {{are used}} to hedge {{congestion}} risk and they are financed by <b>congestion</b> <b>rents.</b> The ISO may not collect enough <b>congestion</b> <b>rents</b> to cover its obligation to the FTR holders; {{this is known as}} revenue inadequacy.

40|$|The main {{thesis of}} this paper is that passive {{transmission}} rights such as Transmission Congestion Contracts (TCCs) that are compensated ex-post based on nodal prices resulting from optimal dispatch by an Independent System Operator (ISO) will be preempted by the strategic bidding of the generators. Thus, even when generation is competitive, rational expectations of congestion will induce implicit collusion enabling generators to raise their bids above marginal costs and capture the <b>congestion</b> <b>rents,</b> leaving the TCCs uncompensated. These conclusions are based on a Cournot model of competition across congested transmission links where an ISO dispatches generators optimally based on bid prices. We characterize the Cournot equilibrium in congested electricity networks with two and three nodes. We show that absent active transmission rights trading, the resulting equilibrium may be at an inefficient dispatch and <b>congestion</b> <b>rents</b> will be captured by the generators. We also demonstrate how active trading of transmission rights in parallel with 42 competitive energy market can prevent the price distortion and inefficient dispatch associated with passive transmission rights. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper reconsiders {{the problem}} of market power when {{generators}} face a demand curve limited by a transmission constraint. After demonstrating that the problem's importance originates in an inherent ambiguity in Cournot-Nash theory, I review Oren's (1997 a) argument that generators in this situation capture all congestion rents. In the one-line case, this argument depends on an untested hypothesis while in the three-line case, the Nash equilibrium was misidentified. Finally, the argument that financial transmission rights (and TCCs in particular) will have zero market value is refuted by modeling the possibility of their purchase by generators. This allows transmission owners, who initially own the TCCs, to capture some of the <b>congestion</b> <b>rent.</b> In fact when total capacity exceeds line capacity by more than {{the capacity of the}} largest generator, TCCs should attain their perfectly competitive value, thereby curbing the market power of generators. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{deregulation}} of electricity industries has generally separated {{the provision of}} generation from its subsequent transmission. However, the physical nature of electricity generation and delivery creates special problems {{for the design of}} efficient markets, notably the need to manage delivery in real time and the resulting volatile congestion costs. In theory, two broad approaches exist for implementing transmission congestion management: (i) a centralised point-to-point (PTP) structure, in which derivative transmission congestion contracts (TCCs) are traded, and (ii) a decentralised approach, in which trading rights exist only on the heavily congested links of the network. Since the latter mechanism focuses on the bottlenecks of the grid, which are fixed by the underlying network topology, it defines a small number of tradable rights, thereby enabling market participants to hedge transmission congestion risk more efficiently. By contrast, while the TCC-based approach, as implemented in New York, provides market participants with a potentially effective hedge against volatile <b>congestion</b> <b>rents,</b> it, nevertheless, results in prices paid for TCCs that are systematically divergent from the resulting <b>congestion</b> <b>rents</b> for distant locations and at high prices. Such inefficiency can be explained in part by the low liquidity of TCC markets and the deviation of TCC feasibility requirements from actual energy flows. It could also be the case that market participants over-pay in this environment out of risk aversion. Analysis of data from the New York TCC markets from 2000 to 2001 indicates that, on aggregate, market participants were only slightly risk averse (or even risk seeking, depending on the utility function employed). As a result, the very design of these markets, rather than the behaviour of market participants, leads to the observed discrepancy between forward and spot prices...|$|R

Also, {{the achievement of}} the EU’s energy policy objectives – sustainability, competitiveness and security of supply – critically depends on adequate investment in physical interconnections between the member states. Mainly focusing on the “regulatory path”, this paper assesses different ways to achieve a sufficient level of interconnector investment. In a first step, economic analysis identifies numerous impediments to interconnector investment adding up to an “interconnector investment failure”. Reflecting on the proper regulatory design of an EU framework able to overcome the interconnector investment failure, a number of recommendations are put forward:  All <b>congestion</b> <b>rents</b> should be channeled into interconnector building. Unused rents should be transferred to a European interconnector fund supervised by an EU agency.  Even though inherently sub‐optimal, merchant transmission investment {{can be used as a}} means to put pressure on regulated transmission system operators (TSO) that do not deliver. An EU agency should have exclusive competence on merchant interconnector exemptions.  A European TSO organization should be entrusted with supra‐national network planning, supervised by an EU agency.  The agency should decide on investment cost reallocation for interconnector projects that yield strong externalities. Payments could be settled via a European interconnector fund.  In case of non‐compliance with the supra‐national network plan, the EU agency should have the right to organize a tender – financed by the European interconnector fund – in order to get the “missing link” built. Assessing the existing EU regulatory framework, the efforts of the 2009 “third energy package” to fill the “regulatory gap” with new EU bodies – ACER and ENTSO‐E – are acknowledged.

40|$|Abstract—Empirical {{evidence}} shows that the clearing prices for point-to-point congestion revenue rights, also known as financial transmission rights (FTRs), resulting from centralized auctions conducted by Independent System Operators differ significantly and systematically from the realized congestion revenues that determine the accrued payoffs of these rights. The question addressed by this paper is whether such deviations are due to price discovery errors which will eventually vanish or due to inherent inefficiencies in the auction structure. We show that even with perfect foresight of average congestion rents the clearing prices for the FTRs depend on the bid quantity and therefore may not be priced correctly in the financial transmission right (FTR) auction. In particular, we demonstrate that if all FTR bid quantities are equal to the corresponding average transaction volumes and the bid values are set at the expected <b>congestion</b> <b>rent</b> level, then the resulting auction prices systematically deviate from the known FTR values. We conclude that price discovery alone would not remedy {{the discrepancy between the}} auction prices and the realized values of the FTRs.

This scheme tries to combine the rigor in the treatment of the energy and transmission capacity transactions with the flexibility and pragmatism that are necessary to make the scheme compatible with the current diversity of regulatory approaches and market structures in the Member States participating in the IEM. First a reference scheme is presented with a complete formulation that jointly deals with the energy and capacity markets. Because of the implementation difficulties of this conceptually ideal approach a more pragmatic scheme is proposed instead. The core of this scheme is an explicit auction mechanism that must be run prior to any short-term (daily, typically) energy markets. In this auction, where only transmission capacity is traded, both bilateral contracts and energy bids to Power Exchanges can participate in order to acquire the capacity necessary to carry out their transactions. Some technical issues related to the practical implementation of the proposed approach are also examined; these include market liquidity, the financial or physical nature of the long-term contracts, the potential problems of “slicing” transmission capacity and the allocation of <b>congestion</b> <b>rents.</b> Market power issues are ignored...|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} from the New York ISO shows that the clearing prices for point-to-point congestion revenue rights, also known as financial transmission rights (FTRs), resulting from centralized auctions conducted by Independent System Operators differ significantly and systematically from the realized congestion revenues that determine the accrued payoffs of these rights. The question addressed by this paper is whether such deviations are due to price discovery errors which will eventually vanish or due to inherent inefficiencies in the auction structure. We show that even with perfect foresight of average <b>congestion</b> <b>rents</b> the clearing prices for the FTRs depend on the bid quantity and therefore may not be priced correctly in the financial transmission right (FTR) auction. In particular, we prove that quantity limits on the FTR bids may cause the auction clearing prices to differ from the bid prices. This phenomenon which {{is inherent in the}} theoretical properties of the optimization algorithm used to clear the auction, is further illustrated through numerical simulations with test systems. We conclude that price discovery alone would not remedy the discrepancy between the auction prices and the realized values of the FTRs. Secondary markets or frequent reconfiguration auctions are necessary in order to achieve such convergence.

40|$|Constrained {{transmission}} capacity in electricity networks may give generators {{the possibility to}} game the market by specifically causing congestion and thereby appropriating excessive rents. Investment in network capacity can ameliorate such behavior by reducing the potential for strategic behavior. However, modeling Nash equilibria between generators, which explicitly account for {{their impact on the}} network, is mathematically and computationally challenging. We propose a three-stage model to describe how network investment can reduce market power exertion: a benevolent planner decides on network upgrades for existing lines anticipating the gaming opportunities by strategic generators. These firms, in turn, anticipate their impact on market-clearing prices and grid congestion. In this respect, we provide the first model endogenizing the trade-off between the costs of grid investment and benefits from reduced market power potential in short-run market clearing. In a numerical example using a three-node network, we illustrate three distinct effects: firstly, by reducing market power exertion, network expansion can yield welfare gains beyond pure efficiency increases. Anticipating gaming possibilities when planning network expansion can push welfare close to a first-best competitive benchmark. Secondly, network upgrades entail a relative shift of rents from producers to consumers when <b>congestion</b> <b>rents</b> were excessive. Thirdly, investment may yield suboptimal or even disequilibrium outcomes when strategic behavior of certain market participants is neglected in network planning...|$|R
