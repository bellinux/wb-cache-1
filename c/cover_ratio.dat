40|$|Geotechnical {{conditions}} such as tunnel dimensions, tunneling method and soil type are few factors influencing the ground movement or disturbance. This paper presents the effect of tunnel <b>cover</b> to diameter <b>ratio</b> and relative density of sand on surface settlement induced by tunneling using physical modelling. The aluminum casing with outer diameter of 50 mm was used to model the tunnel shield. The size of the casing was 2 mm diameter larger than the tunnel lining. The tunnel excavation was done by pulling out the tunnel shield at constant speed with a mechanical pulley. The tested variables are <b>cover</b> to diameter <b>ratio</b> (1, 2 and 3) and relative density of sand (30 %, 50 % and 75 %). The results demonstrated that the surface settlement decreased as the relative density increased. Also, as the relative density of sand increased, the overload factor at collapse increased. The surface settlement was at the highest when the <b>cover</b> to diameter <b>ratio</b> was 2. It can be concluded that in greenfield condition, the relative density and <b>cover</b> to diameter <b>ratio</b> affect the surface settlement...|$|R

However, several crucial problems in its clinic usage and mechanisms are still unsolved or lack scientific evidences. In this research, C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were used to investigate hair growth promotion activity and possible mechanism of PMR and Polygonum multiflorum Radix Preparata (PMRP). Hair growth promotion activities were investigated by hair length, hair <b>covered</b> skin <b>ratio,</b> the number of follicles, and hair color. Regulation effects of several cytokines involved in the hair growth procedure were tested, such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF- 7), Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), β-catenin, insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Oral PMR groups had higher hair <b>covered</b> skin <b>ratio</b> (100 ± 0. 00 %) than oral PMRP groups (48 %~ 88 %). However, topical usage of PMRP had about 90 % hair <b>covered</b> skin <b>ratio.</b> Both oral administration of PMR and topically given PMRP showed hair growth promotion activities.

Although the simple 'vertical slip' solution is intuitively appealing, and provides an upper bound that previous authors have found difficult to improve, it cannot be exact, because it implies an inadmissible stress field. This note describes the stress and velocity fields of a new slip-line solution that improves the upper bound slightly, but more importantly, satisfies all the boundary conditions of the problem (and is therefore a candidate for exactness).

40|$|ABSTRACT] In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the urban environment, the vegetation information is very important. This information should be constructed as the expression of real vegetation, not as that of scale or usage, and also updated to accommodate the change of vegetation. The vegetation <b>cover</b> <b>ratio</b> in a pixel using the remote sensing data simulated by airborne MSS data with high resolution was examined. In this examination a correct vegetation coverage is needed to establish assumption algorithm of vegetation <b>cover</b> <b>ratio</b> in a pixel. This map was constructed by airborne MSS data of high resolution and airborne photograph, which is verified by field investigation. The remote sensing data of low resolution was simulated by high resolution airborne data. The vegetation <b>cover</b> <b>ratio</b> in a pixel {{is defined as the}} ratio of correct vegetation in one pixel of simulated data. On the view point of mixel, the relationship between the vegetation <b>cover</b> <b>ratio</b> in a pixel and the mean NVI (normalized vegetation index) was investigated.

40|$|It is {{essential}} to prevent failures at a tunnel face during tunnel construction to protect existing structures and underground utilities. Many studies have investigated active failure in clay, but passive failure is often overlooked. The objectives {{of this study are}} to investigate passive failure as well as surface heave and excess pore-water pressure induced by tunnel face displacement in a geotechnical centrifuge. Long-term settlement and dissipation of excess pore-water pressure after passive failure are also investigated. For a tunnel located at a <b>cover</b> to diameter <b>ratio</b> of 2. 1, soil in front of the tunnel face is displaced mainly forwards and upwards to the ground surface by the advancing tunnel face. The measured passive failure pressure is closely bounded by the best upper and lower bounds and agrees reasonably well with the cavity expansion solution. For a tunnel located at a <b>cover</b> to diameter <b>ratio</b> of 4. 2, a localized failure mechanism is observed. There is a large discrepancy between the measured passive failure pressure and the upper bound solution. Both longitudinal and transverse surface heaves for tunnels located at <b>cover</b> to diameter <b>ratios</b> of 2. 1 and 4. 2 may be described by two-dimensional Gaussian distributions. The spherical cavity expansion solution appears to overestimate excess pore-water pressure upon passive failure for a tunnel located at a <b>cover</b> to diameter <b>ratio</b> of 2. 1. An average of 90 % degree of consolidation is reached at time factors of 0. 9 and 1. 5 for tunnels located at <b>cover</b> to diameter <b>ratios</b> of 2. 1 and 4. 2, respectively...|$|R

40|$|For 3 -D {{building}} reconstructions {{of urban}} areas, {{we present a}} fully automatic shape recovery method that uses 3 -D points acquired from aerial image sequences. This paper focuses on shape recovery of flat rooftops that are parallel to the ground. We recover each rooftop from a set of 3 -D points located at nearly the same height. Such 3 -D point sets are made by merging point sets under the MDL (Minimum Description Length) principle, which finds suitably concise point sets for 3 -D building models. Often, only parts of rooftop shapes can be recovered because of the 3 -D position errors being generated in the points. To refine the recovered shapes, we merge the parts under a heuristic condition in which shapes will have a pair of orthogonally oriented edges. To optimize parameters and estimate the viability of our method, we defined a success rate, called the <b>cover</b> <b>ratio,</b> as {{the area in which}} the recovered shape and a correct shape (given as reference data) overlap to the combined area of the recovered and correct shapes. Experimental results showed that our method achieved a <b>cover</b> <b>ratio</b> of 75. 25 %, and through improved <b>cover</b> <b>ratio</b> we also confirmed effectiveness of shape refinement.

40|$|The gold {{standard}} {{was a key}} factor behind the Great Depression, but why did it produce such an intense worldwide deflation and associated economic contraction? While the tightening of U.

This “gold hoarding ” created an artificial shortage of reserves and put other countries under enormous deflationary pressure. Counterfactual simulations indicate that world prices would have increased slightly between 1929 and 1933, instead of declining calamitously, if the historical relationship between world gold reserves and world prices had continued.

Recently, an EPA 319 grant allowed for further research in the Upper White River basin. The two-year study (2002 - 2004) examined three watersheds in Delaware County for biotic integrity, habitat quality, and stream water quality parameters. Twenty-two sites were selected to gain a perspective on agricultural, urban, and wooded landscape influences in order to locate and implement Best Management Practices (BMPs). Samples exceeded established state regulations and guideline criteria as follows: E. col/ (80 %), ammonia-N (71 %), dissolved oxygen (55 %), nitrate+nitrite-N (38 %), orthophosphate (33 %), and total suspended solids (18 %). A general linear model indicated {{that the effects of}} watershed and location within each watershed were significant (p < 0. 001) for both the Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QHEI) and Index of Biotic hntegrity (IBI) index scores. Digitized land cover developed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) was created {{to determine the effects of}} agricultural and wooded land <b>cover</b> <b>ratios</b> on the IBI and QHEI indices. A significant positive linear relationship between the amount of woodland land cover in a 5 -m streamside riparian buffer and QHEI (p< 0. 001, r 2 = 0. 55) and with IBI (p< 0. 001, r- 2 = 0. 49) was found. A significant negative linear relationship was found with the amount of agricultural land in the created 5 -m riparian buffer and IBI (p< 0. 001, r' 0. 41), QHEI (p< 0. 001, r 2 _- 0. 36). The 30 -nm streamside riparian buffer and delineated subwatershed land <b>cover</b> <b>ratios</b> were significant for the biotic integrity and habitat quality parameters, but were less predictive than the 5 -m buffers. In addition, the amount of high runoff soils in the subwatersheds had significant negative effects on the IBI (p < 0. 001, r' = 0. 47) and QHEI (p = < 0. 001,r' = 0. 43).

We investigated tree (Acacia mellifera) recruitment after fire and under conditions of maximum-recorded rainfall, nitrogen addition and grazing in a completely-crossed field experiment. We employed a similar garden experiment {{with the exception of}} the fire treatment. Tree germination in the field was extremely low, probably due to below-average natural rainfall in plots that only received natural rain, and insufficient watering frequency in irrigated plots. Due to low germination in the field experiment, no treatment significantly affected tree recruitment. In the garden experiment, frequent watering, nutrient control (i. e. no nitrogen addition) and grazing enhanced tree recruitment with significant interactions between rain, nitrogen and grazing. We infer that above-average rainfall years with frequent rainfall events are required for mass tree recruitment. Grass defoliation makes space and resources available for tree seedlings. Nitrogen enrichment increases the competitive ability of fast-growing grasses more than that of the N 2 -fixing tree component. In contrast to conventional wisdom that grazing alone causes encroachment, we suggest that there are complex interactions between the above-mentioned factors and 'triggering' events such as unusually high rainfall. © Springer 2006.

30|$|In our {{proposed}} statistical test, {{the number}} of the selected coefficients for the detection should be kept very close before and after embedding. As Table 1 illustrated, the <b>ratio</b> of <b>cover</b> channel selection <b>ratio</b> and stego channel selection ratio basically remains the same before and after embedding, which reveals the proportion of the coefficients used for the test as nearly the same. Similarly, the <b>ratio</b> of <b>cover</b> DCT coefs. std and stego DCT coefs. std allows us to verify our assumption that the embedding doesn’t change much the statistical properties of the ‘residual noise’. In addition, those numbers also show that, after rejection of the content, the ‘residual noise’ standard deviation is very small compared to the original DCT coefficients (see also Figures 2 and 3), which thus permits a better detection of modifications due to JSteg embedding. The <b>ratio</b> of <b>cover</b> and stego selection similarity which is kept at the high value signifies that most of the ‘residual noise’ are chosen at the same position. Then, the only difference is the comparison between the <b>cover</b> JSteg selection <b>ratio</b> and stego JSteg selection ratio. It should be noted that if all DCT coefficients used by JSteg are included in the ‘non-zero’ subset, then the ratio equals 100 %. It is observed that {{only a few of the}} DCT coefficients used by the JSteg algorithm is included in the ‘non-zero’ subset. Nevertheless, after embedding, the ratio of stego JSteg selection ratio is largely improved, compared with the <b>ratio</b> of <b>cover</b> JSteg selection <b>ratio.</b> It can be assumed that by using a WF, more ‘residual noise’ from the embedding positions are counted. Besides, prior to embedding secret information, we never know which position will be embedded; the very low <b>ratio</b> of the <b>cover</b> JSteg selection <b>ratio</b> is reasonable.|$|R

Planning the green tracts is often carried out as a part of land use strategy based on relation to neighborhood, their scale, functions, and locational condition. On the other hand, a vegetation-covered area is a considerable focus of investigation for urban environment. For making the vegetation cover map, it is required to estimate vegetation <b>cover</b> <b>ratio</b> widely. Many previous studies have discussed methods to calculate vegetation <b>cover</b> <b>ratio</b> applying satellite remotely sensed data.

40|$|As {{a result}} of climate change, many regions are {{projected}} to see increases in air temperatures and extreme heat events over the coming decades. Since these trends are expected to exacerbate existing conditions in cites, urban heat mitigation {{will be one of}} the key challenges of the twenty-first century. A frequently advocated means of mitigating urban heat is through shade trees. Through the reduction of air and radiative temperatures trees not only improve outdoor human thermal comfort, but also reduce the cooling loads of buildings. This paper investigates the impact of different canopy <b>cover</b> <b>ratios</b> and tree layouts on the urban microclimate. The numerical simulation study utilizes four characteristic dense urban configurations from Budapest (Hungary) to assess the influences of these factors on the effectiveness of shade trees in mitigating urban heat. The study applies ENVI-met for microclimate simulation and MATLAB for the analysis and visualization of the results. Microclimate conditions within the urban canopy layer are examined on the basis of diurnal air and mean radiant temperatures. Preliminary results indicate that the effectiveness of shade trees is the function of the urban configurations' initial thermal performance. Since microclimate improvements by way of trees are primarily achieved through shading, greatest reduction in radiative temperatures is achieved in configurations with large open spaces. In the case of air temperature, increasing the canopy cover increases the added benefit of temperature reduction—indicating that reduced turbulence can in certain cases be beneficial...|$|R
