50|$|Atmospheric Research is a {{scientific}} journal {{dealing with the}} part of the atmosphere where meteorological events occur; intended for atmospheric scientists (such as meteorologists and climatologists), aerosol scientists, and hydrologists. It is a highly international journal with attention given to all processes extending from the earth surface to the tropopause, but special emphasis continues to be devoted to the physics of <b>clouds</b> <b>and</b> precipitation, i.e. atmospheric aerosols; microphysical processes; <b>cloud</b> dynamics <b>and</b> thermodynamics; numerical simulation of <b>cloud</b> processes; <b>clouds</b> <b>and</b> radiation; meso- <b>and</b> macrostructure of <b>clouds</b> <b>and</b> <b>cloud</b> systems, <b>and</b> weather modification.|$|R

5|$|Black Hawk {{and most}} {{of the leaders of the}} British Band were not {{immediately}} captured following the conclusion of hostilities. On 20 August, Sauk and Fox under Keokuk turned over Neapope and several other British Band chiefs to Winfield Scott at Fort Armstrong. Black Hawk, however, remained elusive. After fleeing the battle scene with White <b>Cloud</b> <b>and</b> a small group of warriors, Black Hawk had moved northeast toward the headwaters of the La Crosse River. The group camped for a few days and was eventually counseled by a group of Ho-Chunk, which included White Cloud's brother, to surrender. Though they initially resisted the pleas for surrender, the group eventually traveled to the Ho-Chunk village at La Crosse and prepared to surrender. On 27 August 1832, Black Hawk, White <b>Cloud</b> <b>and</b> the remnants of the British Band surrendered to Joseph M. Street at Prairie du Chien.|$|E

5|$|Early {{drafts of}} Barret's {{background}} featured subtle differences, such as Marlene intended as Barret's biological daughter, {{and his wife}} executed {{in front of him}} by a then-undecided Shinra executive. The attack on Corel was initially written to be due to the discovery of Mako energy and Shinra's desire to keep its existence a secret. His reunion with Dyne was also different, written to culminate in a duel between the two in Corel's ruins, while <b>Cloud</b> <b>and</b> the others fought investigating Shinra soldiers.|$|E
5|$|For pilots, {{knowledge}} of the sky cover helps determine if visual flight rules (VFR) are being met. Knowing the degree of cloud cover can help {{determine whether or not}} various weather fronts, such as cold fronts or warm fronts, have passed by a location. A nephanalysis, contouring areas that are cloudy with scalloped lines, can be performed to indicate a system's <b>cloud</b> <b>and</b> precipitation pattern. This technique is rarely performed nowadays, due to the prevalence of satellite imagery worldwide.|$|E

5|$|Franklin {{realized}} that wooden buildings could {{be protected from}} lightning strikes, and the deadly fires that often resulted, by placing a pointed iron on a rooftop, with {{the other end of}} the rod placed deep into the ground. The sharp point of the lightning rod would attract the electrical discharge from the <b>cloud,</b> <b>and</b> the lightning bolt would hit the iron rod instead of the wooden building. The electric charge from the lightning would flow through the rod directly into the earth, bypassing the structure, and preventing a fire.|$|E

40|$|<b>Clouds</b> <b>and</b> {{precipitation}} {{are essential}} climate variables. Because {{of their high}} spatial and temporal variability, their observation and modeling is difficult. In this thesis multiple observational data sources, including satellite data and station data are globally analyzed to understand the distribution <b>and</b> variability of <b>clouds</b> <b>and</b> precipitation, while a special {{focus is on the}} diurnal cycle of both variables. Substantial diurnal cycles of <b>clouds</b> <b>and</b> precipitation are observed in the tropics, with different properties over land and ocean. But also in Europe cloud diurnal cycles are observed in the summer season. Overall the maximum <b>cloud</b> cover <b>and</b> also the maximum precipitation is observed in the afternoon over land, and in the morning over ocean. The analyzed climate model simulations and the model-based reanalysis fail to simulate the observed diurnal cycles. Owing to their limited resolution, models can not fully resolve the processes responsible for the existence of diurnal cycles of <b>clouds</b> <b>and</b> precipitation...|$|R
