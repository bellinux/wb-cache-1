5|$|After being delisted by the Bombers, Hall was {{pursued by}} {{multiple}} clubs; he had offers from VFL sides Coburg, the Tasmanian Devils, Williamstown and Bendigo, {{as well as}} South Australian National Football League (SANFL) club West Adelaide, before deciding to sign with Devils {{because he wanted to}} <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> family and friends. Hall started the 2004 season playing as a forward and, despite moving into the midfield by mid-season, he was still a regular goalkicker. In June he was named in the VFL representative squad to play against the West Australian Football League, but he missed out on the match due to a hip flexor injury that sidelined him for a month. Hall finished the home and away season in fifth place in The Mercurys Tasmanian Devils Player of the Year award and in equal third place in the Devils' best and fairest.|$|E
5|$|Archie is {{visited by}} Peggy and he pleads {{with her to}} <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> him as she is the woman he loves. Peggy says she {{is not just a}} sweet and {{innocent}} old lady and that he has no idea whom he is messing with. She tells Archie if he does not leave the pub that night he will regret every cruel and evil act he has ever done. He tells her that unless she returns he will have the pub converted to flats. He then becomes emotional as he tells Peggy that he will be waiting for her as she walks out on him. Bradley walks in and punches Archie in the face twice but accidentally punches the bar as well, cutting his hand. He tells Archie to stay away from his girlfriend Stacey because she has said Archie raped her three months previously, and Bradley leaves. As Archie picks up his snowglobe from the floor, the bust of Queen Victoria is pushed from the bar and hits him on the head.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, {{ten years}} after his assassination, Eddie Garcia starred in a film {{biography}} of Climaco, Mayor Cesar Climaco; produced by Seiko Films, the film was rated PG7 {{in an effort to}} show the youth the fights of one of Ninoy Aquino's greatest allies in the fight for democracy. In the film, Climaco goes to Ninoy's residence in the US and convinces him to <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> challenge Marcos for an election.

25|$|Tongans {{no longer}} make an earth oven every day. Most daily cooking is done by women, who cook in {{battered}} pots over open fires in the village, in wood-burning stoves in some households, and on gas or electric ranges {{in some of the}} larger towns. The meal schedule has also changed, to more Westernized breakfast, light lunch, and heavy dinner. Tongans say that the old schedule is unworkable when household members have Western-style jobs, or attend schools at some distance from home; such family members cannot <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> eat, then have a doze after a heavy mid-day meal.|$|E

The fact is, Barack Obama opted to remain in this minister's company for more than six years after that sermon until partially distancing himself just last week in the heat of a presidential race... What the analysts who are gushing over Obama's sentiments regarding race relations are missing is not only did Obama fail to accomplish the mission he needed to, he didn't even really try. He made no attempt to explain his relationship with Wright and why he hung around a man who habitually offered such hateful rhetoric. Obama instead offered a non-sequitur on race relations.|$|E
25|$|When Megan Reeves was kidnapped, Don {{pushed his}} ethics {{to the limit}} to get her back. While he did not {{personally}} beat a suspect, he had Special Agent Ian Edgerton interrogate the teenager for information on where Megan was being held. It is never shown or said what Edgerton did during the interrogation, but it is heavily implied {{that he may have}} used physical force, up to and including applying pressure to the gunshot wound through the teen's wrist; Don expressed concern to his father over being willing to go that far, even if he wasn't doing it himself. After this discussion, he convinced his father that it is good to have someone to <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>to,</b> and that is why he comes around the Craftsman house so often rather than staying at his apartment.|$|E

Ethel is now restricted to a wheelchair and it is left to Dot to cater for her every need, which often leaves her exhausted. Ethel appears to have lost none of her zest for life, despite her considerable age, so it is a huge shock to Dot when Ethel reveals that she is suffering from terminal cancer and is not going to live much longer. Ethel reveals that she has <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> the square to die, but instead of waiting to die in agony, she wants to choose her final moments so she can die with dignity.|$|E

[...] In its first year, Recipe earned $10 million for Campbell's, and, in its third year, $40 million. To help boost sales, Campbell's paid Weatherwax to write a dog-training manual called The Lassie Method which the company used as a premium offer.|$|E

She had died {{a little over a year}} ago and Old Barnet was distraught; he had no wife to <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>to.</b> One day, Maurice showed up and volunteered to help him out around the house while he was out fishing. Poor and sickly, Maurice could not perform difficult tasks, but he was diligent. Old Barnet grew to love Maurice, as did the villagers.|$|E

500|$|Uribe {{was born}} in Baní, Dominican Republic. Growing up, he became {{interested}} in baseball partly due to José Uribe.

When Major League Baseball (MLB) was not in season, José would <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> the Dominican Republic and tell Juan about {{his time in the}} majors playing shortstop for the San Francisco Giants. Juan proved to have baseball ability too. In 1997, Colorado Rockies scout Jorge Posada, Sr., spotted Uribe while he was scouting pitcher Enemencio Pacheco. Posada offered him a $5,000 contract, but Uribe and his father tried to get a higher amount from agent Bob Michelin. Eventually, Uribe settled for $5,000.|$|E
500|$|Deriving from [...] "the biting {{humor of}} Ray Davies and the {{bitterness}} of Paul Weller", Albarn's lyrics on Modern Life Is Rubbish are a social commentary and satire on contemporary suburban English life. While Rubbish celebrates modern British life, it also takes a cynical look at middle-class existence. The overt Anglo-centricism of the album was also retaliation against American popular culture; James later explained, [...] "it was f***ing scary how American everything's becoming ... so {{the whole thing was}} a f***ing big two fingers up to America". NME summarised the theme of the [...] "thinly-veiled concept album" [...] as a [...] "London odyssey crammed full of strange commuters, peeping Thomases and lost dreams; of opening the windows and breathing in petrol ... It's the Village Green Preservation Society <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> find a car park in its place".|$|E
500|$|In 1943, Willis was unopposed for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. The Democrats {{nominated}} J. Lyter Donaldson {{to oppose}} Willis in a contentious three-way primary. Willis's decade-long absence from politics worked to his advantage, {{as he had}} few ties to the state's established politicians and {{little in the way}} of a recent political track record that could be exploited by his opponent. Donaldson warned against changing the political party in power while World War II was still ongoing, but Willis countered that the soldiers must <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> a better state than the one they left, and that would not occur if the Democratic political machine were allowed to continue in power. He further proposed abolition of the state income tax, a proposal that was popular with voters, but was derided by the Democratic-leaning Louisville Courier-Journal as a [...] "weird unreality".|$|E

Upon the release of Spirit, the song debuted at number 173 on the UK Singles Chart {{on the strength of}} digital download sales.

500|$|... "Homeless" [...] {{was written}} by Swedish {{songwriter}} Jörgen Elofsson, and produced by Steve Mac. It is an R power ballad, which lasts for a duration of three minutes and 50 seconds.

500|$|In 2007, Beckinsale starred {{opposite}} Sam Rockwell in {{the independent}} drama Snow Angels, {{based on the novel}} by Stewart O'Nan. The harrowing film, in which she played an overwhelmed single mother, put Beckinsale [...] "in kind of a tough place." [...] "I did have my kid, my husband and, in fact, my ex was around a lot, so it was very nice to <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> my people whom I love." [...] Puig felt [...] "Beckinsale gives her best performance in years" [...] while Richard Corliss of Time described it as [...] "her sharpest work yet." [...] However, Scott felt that [...] "her skill and discipline cannot overcome the sense that she is an exotic species transplanted into this grim ecosystem. Hard as she works to convince us otherwise, it’s a stretch to believe that a woman with the kind of poised confidence in her own beauty she manifests would wind up with an underachieving mouth breather like Glenn." [...] The film grossed just $414,404 worldwide.|$|E
