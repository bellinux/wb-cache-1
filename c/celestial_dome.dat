Geologists tend {{to study}} plate tectonics, meteorites from outer space, and {{resources}} from {{the breakup of the}} supercontinent Gondwana. Glaciologists in Antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and dynamics of floating ice, seasonal snow, glaciers, and ice sheets. Biologists, in addition to examining the wildlife, are interested in how harsh temperatures and the presence of people affect adaptation and survival strategies {{in a wide variety of}} organisms. Medical physicians have made discoveries concerning the spreading of viruses and the body's response to extreme seasonal temperatures. Astrophysicists at Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station study the <b>celestial</b> <b>dome</b> and cosmic microwave background radiation. Many astronomical observations are better made from the interior of Antarctica than from most surface locations because of the high elevation, which results in a thin atmosphere; low temperature, which minimises the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere; and absence of light pollution, thus allowing for a view of space clearer than anywhere else on Earth. Antarctic ice serves as both the shield and the detection medium for the largest neutrino telescope in the world, built [...] below Amundsen–Scott station.|$|E

[...] Golden latticework surrounds the hall, while multi-storied, gold-leaf columns contrast with midnight blue walls. The Joe and Lee Jamail <b>Celestial</b> <b>Dome</b> Ceiling features twinkling fiber optic stars that replicate the Texas night sky. The theatre has three tiers: orchestra, mezzanine, and upper gallery.|$|E
50|$|These {{pictures}} show such {{a perspective}} as follows. They show the day arcs of the Sun, the paths the Sun tracks along the <b>celestial</b> <b>dome</b> in its diurnal movement. The pictures show this for every hour on both solstice days. The longer arc {{is always the}} summer track and the shorter one the winter track. The two tracks are {{at a distance of}} 46.88° (2 × 23.44°) away from each other.|$|E
50|$|Temáukel is {{the supreme}} {{god of the}} Selk'nam and Haush pantheon and, in theory, of all selk'nam deities, {{is the only one}} that is {{considered}} a god itself, since the other deities are identified, rather as mythological ancestors. He is a primordial god, therefore, has always existed. He dwells in the <b>celestial</b> <b>dome,</b> in the eastern sky or Wintek and is the creator of it and the primitive Earth.|$|E
