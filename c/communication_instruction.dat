Entä millaisella opetuksella sitä voisi kehittää? Emma Kostiaisen tutkimuksen perusteella näyttää siltä, että viestintäosaamista tarvitaan erityisesti silloin, kun toimitaan ammatillisen osaamisen äärirajoilla, haasteellisissa tai ongelmallisissa tilanteissa, tai ammattiin oppimisen alkuvaiheessa. -	Viestintä on usein ratkaisevassa asemassa sekä ongelmallisten tilanteiden syntymisessä että niiden ratkaisemisessa. Työyhteisöissä huomaamme ja tiedostamme esimerkiksi eriävät mielipiteemme ollessamme vuorovaikutuksessa toistemme kanssa. Niin ikään voimme ratkaista ongelmia ja konflikteja yleensä vain vuorovaikutuksessa toistemme kanssa, Kostiainen selvittää. The {{main purpose}} of the study is to examine both the {{relationship}} of communication to vocational competence, and the vocational orientation of <b>communication</b> <b>instruction</b> in higher vocational education, as practised in Finnish polytechnics. The study examines teachers’, students’, and polytecnic graduates’ experiences and perceptions. Altogether, 28 communication teachers and 64 students, in 13 groups, were interviewed from the two main disciplines, technology and commerce. The teachers were interviewed in individual, and the students in focus-group interviews. Surveys were distributed to polytechnic graduates, and a total of 277 out of 600 surveys (46, 2 %) were returned. The results seem to indicate that there is a strong tendency in working life to move towards a work culture in which work is mainly based on creating symbols and meanings. Although a transition is taking place from function-based work culture to meaning-based work culture, the meanings workers give to communication do not support this transition, as it might have been assumed. In a meaning-based work culture, workers still use communicative “tools” and concepts typical of function-based work culture. Even though the demands of working life for workers’ communicative competence are very insistent, the meanings workers attach to communication tends not to change in step with the changes in working life. Central issues in <b>communication</b> <b>instruction</b> oriented to vocational development are knowledge of working life, integration of formal and informal learning environments, profession-specific teaching and learning, and the integration of theory and practice.

40|$|The recent {{shift in}} the {{industry}} towards chip multiprocessor (CMP) designs has brought the need for multi-threaded applications to mainstream computing. As observed in several limit studies, most of the parallelization opportunities require looking for parallelism beyond local regions of code. To exploit these opportunities, especially for sequential applications, researchers have recently proposed global multi-threaded instruction scheduling techniques, including DSWP [16] and GREMIO [15]. These techniques simultaneously schedule instructions from large regions of code, such as arbitrary loop nests or whole procedures, and {{have been shown to}} be effective at extracting threads for many applications. A key enabler of these global instruction scheduling techniques is the Multi-Threaded Code Generation (MTCG) algorithm proposed in [16], which generates multi-threaded code for any partition of the instructions into threads. This algorithm inserts <b>communication</b> and synchronization <b>instructions</b> in order to satisfy all inter-thread dependences. In this paper, we present a general compiler framework, COCO, to optimize the <b>communication</b> and synchronization <b>instructions</b> inserted by the MTCG algorithm. This framework, based on threadaware data-flow analyses and graph min-cut algorithms, appropriately models and optimizes all kinds of inter-thread dependences, including register, memory, and control dependences. Our experiments, using a fully automatic compiler implementation of these techniques, demonstrate significant reductions (about 30 % on average) in the number of dynamic <b>communication</b> <b>instructions</b> in code parallelized with DSWP and GREMIO. This reduction in communication translates to performance gains of up to 40 %.

40|$|To harvest {{increasing}} {{levels of}} ILP {{while maintaining a}} fast clock, clustered microarchitectures have been proposed.

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{teaching}} and learning communication strategies has been controversial over the past few decades. Whereas some theoretical arguments reject the benefits of teaching of communication strategies, many practical and empirical studies make pedagogical recommendations and support the idea. Nevertheless, {{there appears to be no}} information on teaching communication strategies to Thai learners of English in Thailand. To address these issues, this thesis investigates the effects of teaching communication strategies to Thai learners of English in Thailand. It was designed as an interventionist study conducted with a group of students. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected in the current study. Sixty-two fourth year students majoring in Engineering at King Mongkut’s University of Technology North Bangkok participated in this study. All the students received a 12 -week <b>communication</b> strategy-based <b>instruction</b> and 12 students were asked to complete four speaking tasks and retrospective protocols. Data were collected via (1) self-report strategy questionnaire, (2) attitudinal questionnaire (3) transcription data of four different speaking tasks, and (4) retrospective protocols. The results from the self-report strategy questionnaire and the speaking tasks showed that the explicit teaching of communication strategies raised students’ awareness of strategy use and promoted the greater use of taught communication strategies of the students. The students considered the taught strategies in <b>communication</b> strategy <b>instruction</b> useful, especially pause fillers and hesitation devices, approximation, self repair and circumlocution. With respect to the retrospective verbal reports, the findings showed that the students tended to be more aware of the taught communication strategies. They revealed their intention and reasons behind their use of some taught communication strategies in more detail while completing the postspeaking tasks. Finally, the positive outcomes of the teaching of some specific communication strategies were supported by the findings of an attitudinal questionnaire on the strategy instruction. The findings suggest that the students found the <b>communication</b> strategy <b>instruction</b> useful for them.

At each level, HISA instructions are classified into <b>communication</b> <b>instructions</b> or computation instructions.
