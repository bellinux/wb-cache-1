My findings support a definition which draws on both models wherein censorship is the exclusion of some discourse {{as the result of a}} judgment by an authoritative agent based on some ideological predisposition. The key word in this definition is "judgment" which, when recognized as the primary activity in censorship, must change the way we approach censorship controversies.
