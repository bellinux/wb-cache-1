This thesis addresses a specific instance of the this problem, known as the <b>Container</b> <b>Packing</b> problem. Special attention is paid to the Pallet Loading problem which is a restricted sub-problem of the general <b>Container</b> <b>Packing</b> problem. Since the Bin Packing problem is NP-complete, it is customary to apply a heuristic measure in order to approximate solutions in a reasonable amount of computation time rather than to attempt,to produce optimal results by applying some exact algorithm. Several heuristics are examined for the problems under consideration, and the results produced by each are shown and compared where relevant...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The <b>packing</b> <b>container</b> is used {{in storage}} and {{transport}} of the high explosive (HE) material. The study concerns {{the safety of the}} <b>packing</b> <b>container</b> in fire environment. The spruce wood filled in the <b>packing</b> <b>container</b> can effectively resist heat transfer and protect HE material. The thermal analysis of the <b>packing</b> <b>container</b> in the pool fire environment is presented with the finite element method. When considering the water evaporation and the wood pyrolysis, the enthalpy curve of wood is presented in this study. Heat can be transferred from the fire to the <b>packing</b> <b>container</b> via convection and radiation. Thus, two thermal boundary conditions are applied to the thermal model of the <b>packing</b> <b>container.</b> The simulations show the inner temperature distributions of the <b>packing</b> <b>container</b> are significantly affected by the wood-column thickness. For the same time, the simulations show there is a slight difference in the char layer thickness between two thickness wood columns. The computed results show there are large temperature gradients in the interface of char and wood. This demonstrates the spruce wood is the excellent thermal resistance material...|$|R

We consider the three-dimensional <b>container</b> <b>packing</b> problem under home delivery service, where each rectangular item with its specific destination is loaded orthogonally onto a rectangular container so that the utilization rate of the container space is maximized. In our framework, we assume the routing of a consignment to be given, which turns out that there is an order of unloading items with respect to the consignment. If we load items without considering the order of unloading items, we may unload and reload other unconcerned items drastically while unloading the required item. Therefore, in this paper, the unloading costs for a consignment are precisely defined according to the invisible and untouchable rule, and a subvolume scheme based algorithm is proposed. Our experimental results suggest our approach to be promising. <b>Container</b> <b>packing</b> problem, home delivery, transportation, logistics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Container</b> <b>packing</b> {{has become}} more and more {{important}} for long-distance transportation as the development of logistics industry. A good container load plan will help to improve efficiency, reduce transportation cost and increase economic benefits. In this paper, we proposed a new optimal algorithm for multi-containers packing problem. The algorithm consists of a heuristic method which is for single-bin loading, and a genetic algorithm which is for multi-containers packing. A new placement nodes strategy was designed according to the container loading characteristics in the heuristics. Through this method, the number of placement nodes was reduced effectively. In genetic algorithm, an innovative chromosome encoding was presented, which is efficient to decrease the chromosome length. The simulation results show that the new algorithm is available and efficient. The proposed algorithm performs better in terms of space utilizations and running time...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} two {{variants of}} Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for solving the Multiple <b>Container</b> <b>Packing</b> Problem (MCPP), {{which is a}} combinatorial optimization problem comprising similarities to the Knapsack Problem and the Bin Packing Problem. Two different representation schemes are suggested, namely direct encoding and order based encoding. While order based encoded solutions are always feasible, a repair algorithm is used in case of direct encoding to ensure feasibility. Additionally, local improvement operators have been applied to both GA variants. The proposed algorithms were empirically compared by using various sets of differently sized test data. Order based encoding performed better for problems with fewer items, whereas direct encoding exhibited advantages when dealing with larger problems. The local improvement operators lead in many cases not only to better final results but also to shorter running times because of higher convergence rates...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a genetic algorithm (GA) {{approach to the}} multiple <b>container</b> <b>packing</b> problem (MCPP), which is a combinatorial optimization problem comprising similarities to the knapsack problem and the bin packing problem. A novel technique for encoding MCPP solutions is used within the GA: The genotype is a vector of numerical weights associated with items of the problem. The corresponding phenotype is obtained by temporarily modifying the original problem according to these weights and applying a greedy decoding heuristic for the MCPP to the new problem. This solution is then evaluated using the original problem data again. Four different decoding heuristics are discussed. They were tested in a weightcoded steady-state GA {{on a variety of}} MCPP instances. Two of the heuristics are clearly more effective than the others, and the GA using them found solutions of significantly higher quality than direct-encoded and order-based GAs from a previous work...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the three-dimensional <b>container</b> <b>packing</b> problem (3 DCPP) under home delivery service, which predetermines an ordering of delivering ordered cargo boxes to customers, and aims to load {{a subset of}} those boxes according to the delivery ordering into a 3 D car container with maximal utilization ratio of the container space while prohibiting the process of delivering cargos to each customer from unloading and subsequent reloading of boxes. In practice, cargos can be taken out from not only the rear door of the delivery container but also the side door. Nonetheless, the previous research only considered the case with only a single door. Therefore, this paper establishes {{the model for the}} two-door 3 DCPP under home delivery service. Furthermore, the rule of invisible and untouchable items and the subvolume-based approach for the one-door problem are extended to resolve the two-door problem. Last, simulation analysis verifies performance of our approach...|$|R

The total energy decreases to a stable value at 2 ns, indicating that the ‘jamming state’ has been achieved [11]. We then probe the <b>packing</b> <b>status</b> of the system. Initially, each building block {{can be regarded as}} a single stack. When two disk-like building blocks stay close enough with each other (center-to-center distance smaller than 1.5 nm) and align in a face-to-face manner, they belong to the same stack. The stack size (the number of disks contained in one stack) ranges from 1 to 12 as shown in Figure  3 d. Packing probability is calculated as the number of stacks divided by the total stack number. For example, the number of double-packed stack (stack that contains two disk-like building blocks) is 137 and the total stack number is 367, so the packing probability of double packed stack is 137 / 367 = 0.37. The probability distribution of the stack size can be fitted by a log-normal distribution, as reported in the study on clay aggregates [11, 22]. Most stacks are composed of two or three building blocks, the average stack size is 2.7.
