2500|$|NMR has now {{entered the}} arena of {{real-time}} process control and process optimization in oil refineries and petrochemical plants. Two different types of NMR analysis are utilized to provide real time analysis of feeds and products {{in order to control}} and optimize unit operations. Time-domain NMR (TD-NMR) spectrometers operating at low field (2–20MHz for [...] ) yield free induction decay data {{that can be used to}} determine absolute hydrogen content values, rheological information, and component composition. These spectrometers are used in mining, polymer production, cosmetics and food manufacturing as well as coal analysis. High resolution FT-NMR spectrometers operating in the 60MHz range with shielded permanent magnet systems yield high resolution [...] NMR spectra of refinery and petrochemical streams. The variation observed in these spectra with changing physical and chemical properties is modeled using <b>chemometrics</b> to yield predictions on unknown samples. The prediction results are provided to control systems via analogue or digital outputs from the spectrometer.|$|E

50|$|<b>Chemometrics</b> is {{the science}} of extracting {{information}} from chemical systems by data-driven means. <b>Chemometrics</b> is inherently interdisciplinary, using methods frequently employed in core data-analytic disciplines such as multivariate statistics, applied mathematics, and computer science, {{in order to address}} problems in chemistry, biochemistry, medicine, biology and chemical engineering. In this way, it mirrors other interdisciplinary fields, such as psychometrics and econometrics.|$|E
5000|$|Experimental design {{remains a}} core {{area of study}} in <b>chemometrics</b> and several monographs are {{specifically}} devoted to experimental design in chemical applications.

The techniques employed in <b>chemometrics</b> are similar to those used in other fields - multivariate discriminant analysis, logistic regression, neural networks, regression/classification trees. The use of rank reduction techniques in conjunction with these conventional classification methods is routine in <b>chemometrics,</b> for example discriminant analysis on principal components or partial least squares scores.|$|E

50|$|Although {{one could}} argue that even the {{earliest}} analytical experiments in chemistry involved a form of <b>chemometrics,</b> the field is generally recognized to have emerged in the 1970s as computers became increasingly exploited for scientific investigation. The term ‘chemometrics’ was coined by Svante Wold in a grant application 1971, and the International <b>Chemometrics</b> Society was formed shortly thereafter by Svante Wold and Bruce Kowalski, two pioneers in the field. Wold was a professor of organic chemistry at Umeå University, Sweden, and Kowalski was a professor of analytical chemistry at University of Washington, Seattle.|$|E
