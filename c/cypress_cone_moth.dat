40|$|An {{evaluation}} {{was made}} in 21 seed production areas and 1 seed orchard in Region 1 to identify the primary insect pests and to assess amount of injury caused. Cones from Douglas-fir, grand fir, western larch, lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, and western white pine were collected periodically and examined. The primary insect species observed were western spruce budworm on Douglas-fir, grand fir, and western larch; midges on Douglas fir, grand fir, western larch, ponderosa pine, and lodgepole pine; coneworms on Douglas-fir, grand fir, western larch, and ponderosa pine; and the Douglas-fir <b>cone</b> <b>moth</b> on Douglas-fir...|$|R
40|$|The {{biology of}} Megastimus wachtli Seitner (Hymenoptera: Torymidae) {{was found to}} be similar to other species of Megastigmus. During the period of flight that lasted six weeks from the {{beginning}} of September to mid-October, M. wachtli laid eggs in cypress (Cupressus sempervirens L., Pinales: Cupressaceae) cones and showed preferences for oviposition on particular sites on cones. M. wachtli has a high potential for colonization because it has evolutionary advantages due to its developmental possibilities including its capacity for parthenogenesis, its fecundity and longevity. It generally did not attack cones colonized by the torticid moth, Pseudococcyx tessulatana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). The competition between these species for use of <b>cypress</b> <b>cones</b> suggests that they use different strategies for different species of cypress. The number of insects that could develop relative to the number of cones available also varies between species of cypress...|$|R
40|$|Six {{species of}} insects were found attacking limber pine cones from July 26, 1968, through October 4, 1969, in Cache National Forest. The three species {{considered}} of major importance are: Conophthorus flexilis Hopkins, Dioryctria abietella (D. 2 ̆ 6 S.), and D. sp. near or disclusa Heinrich. The three minor species encountered are; Bradysia sp., Trogoderma parabile Beal, and Asynapta keeni (Foote). In {{addition to the}} major and minor cone pests three parasites, Apanteles sp. prob. starki Mason, Elacherus sp., and Hypopteromalus percussor Girault were found associated with the cone pests. C. flexilis, which completely destroys the cone, was ranked as the number one pest {{on the basis of}} numbers present plus severity of damage. During 1968 and 1969 C. flexilis destroyed 11. 47 percent of the 1500 cones examined, with a mean of 5. 87 larvae per infested <b>cone.</b> The <b>cone</b> <b>moths,</b> D. abietella and D. sp. near or disclusa, were ranked second and third in importance respectively. D. sp. near or disclusa was potentially the more important <b>cone</b> <b>moth,</b> as it caused a total destruction of the seed bearing portion of the cones. However, D. abietella infested 15. 40 percent of the cones, in contrast to 2. 00 percent by D. sp. near or disclusa. There were no significant statistical differences in insect populations between 1968 and 1969, although the percent infestation of C. flexilis and D. sp. near or disclusa increased slightly and D. abietella decreased...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 A {{population}} of the Douglas-fir <b>cone</b> <b>moth,</b> Barbara colfaxiana (Kft.), was studied on the Buckhead Seed Production Area, Oakridge, Oregon, during 1971 and 1972. A method of estimating cone and insect populations is presented. Factors contributing to the mortality of B. colfaxiana are discussed, with resinosis being the critical factor. Larval food consumption is discussed with reference to calories of cone tissue consumed through time. An average of 761 calories are consumed through the four larval stages. Amounts consumed of each structure (bracts, scales, seeds) are presented. A structural model is presented that depicts the role of B. colfaxiana in a natural stand...|$|R
50|$|The ash leaf <b>cone</b> roller <b>moth</b> (Caloptilia fraxinella) is a moth of the Gracillariidae family. It {{is known}} from Canada (Québec, Alberta, Ontario and Saskatchewan) and the United States (Michigan, Vermont, Ohio, Connecticut, New York and Maine).|$|R
30|$|For any plant, {{successful}} establishment {{from seed}} occurs when seed availability {{and the availability}} of establishment opportunities coincide in space and time. Stand-replacing fires in McNab cypress stands lead to widespread and rapid cone opening, followed by intense seed rain and dense seedling recruitment. However, in contrast to the cones of serotinous pines that also open following intense crown fires, McNab <b>cypress</b> <b>cones</b> consist of living tissue and the proximal cause of cone opening is generally tissue death and subsequent desiccation rather than exposure to heat (C.R. Mallek, unpublished data). This mechanism of cone-opening has been reported for other serotinous members of the Cupressaceae (Harvey et al. 1980, Zedler 1986, Lev-Yadun 1995, Garcillan 2010). Consequently, storm damage, cone-boring insects, pathogens, and old age may contribute to either the death of entire trees, individual branches, or isolated cones resulting in inter-fire cone opening followed by low levels of seed dispersal. In many stands, destruction of living cones by birds, perhaps as a means of foraging for cone-boring insects, may also result in the release of small quantities of seed (C.R. Mallek, personal observation).|$|R
40|$|Insect {{damage was}} {{extensive}} to Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, western white pine, and western larch cones at most seed production areas surveyed in 1979. From 70 to 100 {{percent of the}} cones from several collecting periods were injured. Moderate damage (40 - 70 percent of cones injured) occurred to Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, western larch, and western white pine from a few areas. Light damage (less than 40 percent) occurred on western white pine cones from a few seed production areas, and to all lodgepole pine and western hemlock cones collected. The primary insect species observed were western spruce budworm on Douglas-fir and western larch; midges on Douglas-fir, western larch, ponderosa pine, and lodgepole pine; cone worms on Douglas-fir, western larch, and ponderosa pine; and the Douglas-fir <b>cone</b> <b>moth</b> on Douglas-fir...|$|R
50|$|Members of {{the cypress}} family (cypresses, arborvitae, junipers, redwoods, etc.) differ {{in that the}} bract and seed scales are fully fused, with the bract visible as {{no more than a}} small lump or spine on the scale. The botanical term galbulus (plural galbuli; from the Latin for a <b>cypress</b> <b>cone)</b> is {{sometimes}} used instead of strobilus for members of this family. The female cones have one to 20 ovules on each scale. They often have peltate scales, as opposed to the imbricate cones described above, though some have imbricate scales. The cones are usually small, 0.3 - 6 cm long, and often spherical or nearly so, like those of Nootka cypress, while others, such as western redcedar and California incense-cedar, are narrow. The scales are arranged either spirally, or in decussate whorls of two (opposite pairs) or three, rarely four. The genera with spiral scale arrangement were often treated in a separate family (Taxodiaceae) in the past. In most of the genera, the cones are woody and the seeds have two narrow wings (one along each side of the seed), but in three genera (Platycladus, Microbiota and Juniperus), the seeds are wingless, and in Juniperus, the cones are fleshy and berry-like.|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{explanation for}} the exceptional diversity of herbivorous insects emphasizes host shift as the major driver of speciation. However, phylogenetic studies have often demonstrated widespread host plant conservatism by insect herbivores, calling into question the prevalence of speciation by host shift to distantly related plants. A limitation of previous phylogenetic studies is that host plants were defined at the family or genus level; thus, {{it was unclear whether}} host shifts predominate at a finer taxonomic scale. The lack of a statistical approach to test the hypothesis of host-shift-driven speciation also hindered studies at the species level. Here, we analyze the radiation of leaf <b>cone</b> <b>moths</b> (Caloptilia) associated with maples (Acer) using a newly developed, phylogeny-based method that tests the role of host shift in speciation. This method has the advantage of not requiring complete taxon sampling from an entire radiation. Based on 254 host plant records for 14 Caloptilia species collected at 73 sites in Japan, we show that major dietary changes are more concentrated toward the root of the phylogeny, with host shift playing a minor role in recent speciation. We suggest that there may be other roles for host shift in promoting herbivorous insect diversification rather than facilitating speciation per se...|$|R
40|$|Polyunsaturated {{hydrocarbons}} (Type II pheromone components) {{have been}} reported to be synergists for unsaturated acetates, alcohols or aldehydes (Type I components) in the sex pheromones of several species of Lepidoptera. However, there is some debate over whether the active components are the hydrocarbons themselves or more volatile degradation products. Extracts of pheromone glands of adult females of the <b>cone</b> <b>moth,</b> Dioryctria mendacella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), contain (Z,E) - 9, 11 -tetradecadienyl acetate (ZE 9, 11 - 14 :Ac) and at least ten times as much (Z,Z,Z,Z,Z) - 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 -pentacosapentaene (ZZZZZ 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 - 25 :H). The former elicits a strong electroantennogram response from males while no response could be recorded to the latter. In field trapping tests, both compounds were individually unattractive to male D. mendacella moths, but blends of the two compounds containing at least a 10 : 1 ratio of ZZZZZ 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 - 25 :H : ZE 9, 11 - 14 :Ac were highly attractive. The relatively involatile hydrocarbon was shown to be released from the dispensers used and no significant degradation could be detected. Furthermore, blends of ZE 9, 11 - 14 :Ac and analogs of ZZZZZ 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 - 25 :H with fewer carbons and/or double bonds that might be expected to produce similar degradation products to ZZZZZ 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 - 25 :H were unattractive. This indicated a specific response to the hydrocarbon itself, further substantiated by the observation that related hydrocarbons did not interfere with the activity of ZZZZZ 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 - 25 :H. Thus a three-step conversion of fish oil was used to produce a blend of unsaturated hydrocarbons containing ZZZZZ 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 - 25 :H as the major component, albeit only 30 % of the total, and a blend of this material with ZE 9, 11 - 14 :Ac was as attractive to male D. mendacella moths as blends with an equivalent amount of the purified material. This mixture of unsaturated hydrocarbons is much cheaper to produce than the pure pentaene, and may be useful in lures for other species using these compounds. Dioryctria mendacella is a major constraint to production of edible pine kernels throughout the Mediterranean region. Pheromone traps will provide a means to improve monitoring of seasonal flight patterns and changes in population abundance of this pest...|$|R
