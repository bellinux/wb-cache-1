5|$|An {{analysis}} of the invertebrate population in the canopy of Banksia woodland found that mites and ticks (Acari), beetles (Coleoptera) and ants, bees and wasps (Hymenoptera) predominated overall, with the three orders also <b>common</b> <b>on</b> B. ilicifolia, although outnumbered by thrips (Thysanoptera). More arthropods on B. ilicifolia {{might be related to}} a higher nutrient (potassium) level in the leaves. Lower overall numbers of invertebrates on Banksia species were thought {{to be related to the}} presence of insectivorous birds.|$|E

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Halloween had turned into a night of vandalism, with {{destruction}} of property and cruelty to animals and people. Around 1912, the BSA, Boys Clubs and other neighborhood organizations came together to encourage a safe celebration that would end the destruction that had become so <b>common</b> <b>on</b> this night.|$|E
5|$|Cirrus Spissatus {{clouds are}} the highest clouds of the main cloud genera. They may form in the higher {{tropopause}} or even at the lower stratosphere.

5|$|Historical {{accuracy}} {{was important}} to many British designers, resulting {{in the use of}} genuine military equipment as models for memorials, and long discussions with committees over the details to be incorporated into designs. In contrast, the British interest in accurately depicting real weaponry from the war was far less <b>common</b> <b>on</b> German monuments, where usually stylised medieval weapons and armour were used.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to hosting photosynthesizing endosymbionts, sponges are noted for their {{wide range of}} collaborations with other organisms. The relatively large encrusting sponge Lissodendoryx colombiensis is most <b>common</b> <b>on</b> rocky surfaces, but has extended its range into seagrass meadows by letting itself be surrounded or overgrown by seagrass sponges, which are distasteful to the local starfish and therefore protect Lissodendoryx against them; in return the seagrass sponges get higher positions away from the sea-floor sediment.|$|E
5|$|Individual F. aurea {{trees are}} <b>common</b> <b>on</b> dairy farms in La Cruz, Cañitas and Santa Elena in Costa Rica, {{since they are}} often spared when forest is {{converted}} to pasture. In interviews, farmers identified the species as useful for fence posts, live fencing and firewood, and as a food species for wild birds and mammals.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that, during the Solar System's formation, Mars was created {{as the result}} of a {{stochastic}} process of run-away accretion of material from the protoplanetary disk that orbited the Sun. Mars has many distinctive chemical features caused by its position in the Solar System. Elements with comparatively low boiling points, such as chlorine, phosphorus, and sulphur, are much more <b>common</b> <b>on</b> Mars than Earth; these elements were probably pushed outward by the young Sun's energetic solar wind.|$|E

5|$|Larvae {{of other}} Chrysomelids are predated by birds, coccinellids, predatory bugs, {{lacewing}} larvae, syrphid larvae, carabids, ants, wasps, spiders and harvestmen, {{all of which}} are <b>common</b> <b>on</b> the tansy around the York population. The pupal stage may be directly predated by the European mole.|$|E
5|$|Methane {{can exist}} in the Martian {{atmosphere}} for only a limited period before it is destroyed—estimates of its lifetime range from 0.6–4 years. Its presence despite this short lifetime indicates that an active source of the gas must be present. Volcanic activity, cometary impacts, {{and the presence of}} methanogenic microbial life forms are among possible sources. Methane could be produced by a non-biological process called serpentinization involving water, carbon dioxide, and the mineral olivine, which is known to be <b>common</b> <b>on</b> Mars.|$|E
5|$|Most broaches {{are made}} from high speed steel (HSS) or an alloy steel; TiN {{coatings}} are <b>common</b> <b>on</b> HSS to prolong life. Except when broaching cast iron, tungsten carbide is rarely used as a tooth material because the cutting edge will crack on the first pass.|$|E

5|$|Other {{breeding}} birds include ringed plovers and Eurasian oystercatchers {{in the sand}} dunes, and water rails in the reed bed. Sedge, reed and Cetti's warblers all nest in the wetland, and little egrets are now <b>common</b> <b>on</b> the reserve. In early summer, scarcer migrants like the little gull, black tern, Eurasian spoonbills and garganey may pass through {{on their way to}} breed elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Red {{deer are}} <b>common</b> <b>on</b> {{the hills and}} the grey seal and common seal are present around the coasts of Scotland. Colonies of seals are found on Oronsay and the Treshnish Isles.
