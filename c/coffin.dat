5|$|<b>Coffin,</b> wooden: The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} wooden <b>coffin</b> remains, dated at 5000 BC, {{was found in}} the Tomb 4 at Beishouling, Shaanxi. Clear evidence of a wooden <b>coffin</b> {{in the form of a}} rectangular shape was found in Tomb 152 in an early Banpo site. The Banpo <b>coffin</b> belongs to a four-year-old girl, measuring 1.4m (4.5ft) by 0.55m (1.8ft) and 3–9cm thick. As many as 10 wooden coffins have been found from the Dawenkou culture (4100–2600 BC) site at Chengzi, Shandong. The thickness of the <b>coffin,</b> as determined by the number of timber frames in its composition, also emphasized the level of nobility, as mentioned in the Classic of Rites, Xunzi and Zhuangzi. Examples of this have been found in several Neolithic sites; the double <b>coffin,</b> the earliest of which {{was found in the}} Liangzhu culture (3400–2250 BC) site at Puanqiao, Zhejiang, consists of an outer and an inner <b>coffin,</b> while the triple <b>coffin,</b> with its earliest finds from the Longshan culture (3000–2000 BC) sites at Xizhufeng and Yinjiacheng in Shandong, consists of two outer and one inner coffins.|$|E
5|$|At SummerSlam 1992 in August, The Undertaker {{defeated}} Kamala. Harvey Wippleman, Kamala's manager wanted revenge, so {{a rematch}} {{was scheduled for}} Survivor Series. The match was promoted as the WWF's first <b>coffin</b> match, in which the winner would place the loser in a <b>coffin</b> after the match.|$|E
5|$|At {{the urging}} of friends in the anti-slavery movement, <b>Coffin</b> moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1847 to operate a {{warehouse}} that sold only free-labor goods. Despite making considerable progress with the business, the free-labor venture proved unprofitable and he abandoned the enterprise in 1857. From 1847 through 1857, <b>Coffin</b> continued to assist hundreds of runaway slaves by lodging them in his Ohio home. When slavery was abolished after the American Civil War, <b>Coffin</b> traveled around the Midwest and overseas to France and Great Britain, where he was instrumental in forming aid societies that provided food, clothing, funds, and education to former slaves. <b>Coffin</b> retired from public life in the 1870s and wrote an autobiography, Reminiscences of Levi <b>Coffin,</b> published in 1876, a year before his death.|$|E
5000|$|Among the Christians the use {{of custom}} <b>coffins</b> is {{relatively}} new and began in the Greater Accra Region around 1950. These <b>coffins</b> were formerly used only by the Ga chiefs and priests, but since around 1960 figurative <b>coffins</b> have {{become an integral part}} of the local funeral culture. The Christians had taken over the figurative <b>coffins</b> from the traditional Ga who were using figurative palanquins and <b>coffins</b> already since the beginning of the 20th century.|$|R
50|$|As the {{anthropologist}} Regula Tschumi recently wrote, the figurative <b>coffins</b> developed {{out of the}} figurative palanquins which were formerly used like the figurative <b>coffins</b> in Accra only by the traditional chiefs. Around 1960 the use of figurative <b>coffins</b> for Ga burial rites became widespread. Design <b>coffins</b> are acknowledged as symbolic of contemporary creation in Africa.|$|R
50|$|When {{the chapel}} was inaugurated in September 1825, <b>coffins</b> {{that had been}} {{temporarily}} stored in Christian IV's chapel were moved to the new chapel, and {{as members of the}} royal family died, more were added. This led to the chapel, which had been designed for five marble sarcophagi, holding upwards of 17 <b>coffins</b> in 1912. However, the addition of Christian IX's chapel, the removal of some <b>coffins</b> to the crypts, and a rearrangement of the <b>coffins,</b> led to the present situation where only 12 <b>coffins</b> and sarcophagi are present. It has however led to confusion, as some of the <b>coffins</b> have not been arranged in the pairs which correspond to the relationships that existed during their lifetimes.|$|R
5|$|Beattie and {{his team}} had noticed that someone else had {{attempted}} to exhume Hartnell. In the effort, a pickaxe had damaged the wooden lid of his <b>coffin,</b> and the <b>coffin</b> plaque was missing. Research in Edmonton later showed that Sir Edward Belcher, commander {{of one of the}} Franklin rescue expeditions, had ordered the exhumation of Hartnell in October 1852, but was thwarted by the permafrost. A month later, Edward A. Inglefield, commander of another rescue expedition, succeeded with the exhumation and removed the <b>coffin</b> plaque.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's body {{reportedly}} sustained two falls. As the <b>coffin</b> {{was lifted}} into {{place for the}} lying in state at the Column Hall of the House of the Unions, Brezhnev's body fell through the bottom. After that, a new, metal-plated <b>coffin</b> was made, and as it was lowered into the grave, the funeral servants could not handle its weight and the <b>coffin</b> fell with a loud crash into the grave hole. This account, however, was contested by Georgy Kovalenko, one of the funeral servants—according to him, twenty minutes before the deposition of the <b>coffin</b> he {{was asked by the}} Kremlin custodian Semyon Shornikov to lower the <b>coffin</b> simultaneously with the chime of bells.|$|E
5|$|During the funeral, as the <b>coffin</b> {{was moving}} from the hearse to the grave site, Navy SEALs were lined up forming a column of twos {{on both sides of}} the pallbearers route, with the <b>coffin</b> moving up the center. As the <b>coffin</b> passed each SEAL, they slapped down the gold Trident each had removed from his own uniform and deeply {{embedded}} it into the wooden <b>coffin.</b> For nearly 30 minutes the slaps were audible from across the cemetery as nearly every SEAL on the West Coast repeated the act.|$|E
40|$|This {{volume is}} the first {{in-depth}} study of Egyptian Second Intermediate Period rishi <b>coffins.</b> It includes a catalogue of all published and many unpublished rishi <b>coffins</b> and provides {{an evaluation of the}} funerary culture of the period with a typology of rishi <b>coffins.</b> Most <b>coffins</b> are presented with photographic pictures. This includes all examples stored in the Egyptian Museum of Cairo and unpublished material from Winlock's excavations in Thebes...|$|R

5000|$|There were burials {{containing}} anthropoid ceramic <b>coffins</b> excavated at {{the sites}} of Deir el-Balah and Beth Shean predominantly, however there were <b>coffins</b> found in smaller numbers at Lachish, Tell el-Far’ah, Sahab, and the Jezreel Valley. Many of the excavated anthropoid ceramic <b>coffins</b> from Deir el-Balah were buried in similar ritual contexts dating from the 14th-11th centuries BCE. The <b>coffins</b> were cut into a foundation of Kurkar (sandstone) or hamrah (red sand) and lined with rough stones and oriented to the west. [...] The <b>coffins</b> at Deir el-Balah were marked with large pithoi {{at the head of}} the burial with dipper jugs inside and bowls on top serving as lids, these deposits served as the grave markers. At Deir el-Balah the <b>coffins</b> typically contained more than one individual and contained up to four people in some cases. At Beth Shean the <b>coffins</b> were placed into rock cut tombs also facing the west from the same time period as Deir el-Balah. The northern cemetery at Beth Shean contained roughly fifty <b>coffins</b> with surviving face lids. These graves had been disturbed in antiquity and the amount of information left was sparse. The <b>coffins</b> from Beth Shean were unique and were adorned with headdresses, which some have suggested to mean they are of Philistine origin. At Lachish and Tell el-Far’ah the several rock cut tombs found there containing anthropoid ceramic <b>coffins</b> date from a later period, 12th-10th centuries BCE, and are mostly associated with Philistine offerings.|$|R
5|$|On October 28, 1824, <b>Coffin</b> {{married his}} long-time friend, Catharine White. The wedding {{ceremony}} {{was held in}} the Hopewell Friends Meetinghouse in North Carolina. Catharine's family {{is believed to have been}} involved in helping slaves escape, and it is likely she met <b>Coffin</b> because of this activity.|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} results of {{excavations}} 2014 in Moscow Theological Academy’s necropolis where 37 different funerary complexes were investigated. Among other findings, several wooden <b>coffins</b> were studied. Relatively well preserved organic remains allowed {{the researchers to}} reliably reconstruct the shape and decoration of the <b>coffins,</b> as well as distribute studied materials by chronological periods and identify characteristics that determine {{the status of the}} deceased. It was found out that the <b>coffins</b> for the clergy had a reddish color. The discovered wooden <b>coffins</b> were distributed by types according to previously developed typology. A new subtype was added. Features for <b>coffins</b> from graves of certain historical periods were determined. The period of existence of the necropolis was determined within 1871 – 1920 s, with five stages. It is noteworthy that even in such late period log <b>coffins</b> were used in several burials...|$|R

5|$|Treetrunk coffin: The treetrunk <b>coffin,</b> single trunk <b>coffin</b> or boat <b>coffin</b> {{was one of}} {{the common}} burials found mainly in the {{southern}} China. One of the few earliest boat coffins are found among the 92 burial tombs in the Songze culture (4000–3000 BC) site at Jiaxing, Zhejiang, similar finds can also be found in the middle phase of Dawenkou culture (4100–2600 BC) sites.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Hartnell's grave, {{the grave}} of Private William Braine was largely intact. When he was exhumed, the survey team saw signs that his burial had been hasty. His arms, body, and head had not been {{positioned}} carefully in the <b>coffin,</b> {{and one of his}} undershirts had been put on backwards. The <b>coffin</b> seemed too small for him; its lid had pressed down on his nose. A large copper plaque with his name and other personal data punched into it adorned his <b>coffin</b> lid.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{similarities}} to Egyptian burials and iconography found in Near Eastern Clay Coffins.https://web.archive.org/web/20141205193734/http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/dept/education/learningresources/factsheets/ancientegyptians/fs_coffins.pdf <b>Coffins</b> with face lids from Egypt’s poor http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/4170/Anthropoid_Coffin_of_Thothirdes have been dated to 18th and 19th Dynasties (ca. 1575-1200). Lotus flowers carved into head masks {{as a symbol}} of rebirth. The features of the face have visibly Egyptian, the slanting shape of the eyes, arched eyebrows, and representation of the hair and the wigs are the most notable. Roman <b>coffins,</b> from an later period then our Near Eastern <b>coffins,</b> are poor earthenware imitations. Both the Near Eastern <b>coffins</b> and those of the Roman’s are imitations of Egyptian style <b>coffins</b> with individual features being characteristic of the regions they were crafted.|$|R
5|$|As the {{persecution}} worsened, thousands of Quakers left North Carolina for the Old Northwest, where slavery was prohibited and land was less expensive. (A large Quaker community {{that had already}} settled in what became Ohio and Indiana had been influential in securing a territorial ban on slavery.) In 1822 <b>Coffin</b> accompanied Benjamin White to Indiana and stayed in Indiana with the Whites for about a year. On his return to North Carolina, <b>Coffin</b> brought back reports of Indiana and its prosperity. Convinced that Quakers and slaveholders could not co exist, <b>Coffin</b> {{decided to move to}} Indiana.|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} fifteen, <b>Coffin</b> {{was helping}} his family assist {{escaping}} slaves by taking food {{to those who were}} hiding on his family's farm. As the repressive Fugitive Slave Act became more rigorously enforced, the <b>Coffin</b> family began to assist slaves in greater secrecy, doing most of their illegal activities at night. Scrutiny of the abolitionists only worsened {{with the passage of the}} 1804 Black Laws. By the early 1820s Quakers in North Carolina were being openly persecuted for the assistance they were suspected of providing to runaway slaves. In 1821 <b>Coffin</b> and his cousin, Vestal, established a Sunday School to teach slaves to read the Bible, but the plan was short-lived; slaveholders soon forced the school to close.|$|E
5|$|<b>Coffin</b> {{continued}} to farm {{after moving to}} Indiana and {{within a year of}} his arrival he opened the first dry-goods store in Newport. In later years <b>Coffin</b> credited the success of his business, which he expanded in the 1830s, with providing him the ability to become heavily involved in the costly enterprise of the Underground Railroad, a costly and risky enterprise that provided a network of stopover sites for fugitive slaves as they traveled north into Canada.|$|E
25|$|Disinterment {{ended at}} 10:00 P.M. local time. The 151 <b>coffins</b> {{were taken to}} Machina Wharf and held under guard overnight. Early the next morning, the <b>coffins</b> were placed about two small steamships, which took the dead at 6:00 A.M. to the Texas. The <b>coffins</b> were {{arranged}} on the Texas afterdeck in groups and covered in canvas. Many American flags and wreaths evergreens and artificial flowers {{were placed on the}} canvas coverings, and the <b>coffins</b> guarded by U.S. Marines day and night until the ship reached Hampton Roads.|$|R
50|$|Some {{rectangular}} <b>coffins</b> of the Twelfth Dynasty have short inscriptions and {{representations of}} the most important offerings the deceased required. For men the objects depicted were weapons and symbols of office as well as food. Women's <b>coffins</b> depicted mirrors, sandals, and jars containing food and drink. Some <b>coffins</b> included texts that were later versions of the royal Pyramid Texts.|$|R
50|$|Hanging <b>coffins</b> are {{an ancient}} funeral custom of some ethnic groups, {{especially}} the Bo people of southern China. <b>Coffins</b> of various shapes were mostly carved from one whole piece of wood. Hanging <b>coffins</b> either lie on beams projecting outward from vertical faces such as mountains, {{are placed in}} caves {{in the face of}} cliffs, or sit on natural rock projections on mountain faces.|$|R
5|$|<b>Coffin</b> {{grew up on}} {{the family}} farm in North Carolina. He was educated at home and {{received}} little, if any, formal education. Exposed to slaves throughout his childhood, he sympathized with their condition. According to his own account, <b>Coffin</b> became an abolitionist at the age of seven when he asked a slave who was in a chain gang why he was bound. The man replied that it was to prevent him from escaping and returning to his wife and children. The event disturbed <b>Coffin,</b> who considered the impact of a father being taken away from his family.|$|E
5|$|<b>Coffin</b> {{moved to}} the Cincinnati area in 1847, where {{he took over the}} {{management}} of a wholesale warehouse of free-labor goods. With the intention of returning to Newport, Indiana, after fulfilling his obligation in Cincinnati, <b>Coffin</b> rented out his Newport business and made arrangements for his Indiana home to continue serving as an Underground Railroad stop. At Cincinnati his first task was working with the eastern organizations to set up a steady supply of free-labor goods for the business. The enterprise's ongoing problem was the poor quality of its goods. <b>Coffin</b> had difficulty procuring free goods, such as cotton, sugar, and spices, whose quality was competitive with the goods produced by slave labor. With inferior quality goods to sell, he had a difficult time finding purchasers for the goods. The problem plagued the business for years, causing the enterprise constant financial struggles.|$|E
5|$|<b>Coffin</b> {{was born}} on a farm near New Garden in Guilford County, North Carolina on October 28, 1798. He was one of seven {{children}} and the only son of Prudence and Levi <b>Coffin</b> Sr. Both of his parents were devout Quakers. Coffin's father was born in Massachusetts during the 1760s and migrated from Nantucket to North Carolina, {{where he was a}} farmer among a community of Quakers.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to date wooden <b>coffins</b> {{excavated}} from graves in Shinnae-dong, Seoul, South Korea, using dendrochronology. The {{species of}} woods {{used to make}} the <b>coffins</b> were identified as Pinus densi-flora S. et Z., one of the major conifers in Korea. Of 12 graves, 10 were successfully dated using various red-pine chronologies of South Korea. Due to the absence of the last-formed tree ring before felling, the number of sapwood rings, used to obtain likely cutting dates, had to be estimated. The terminus post quem for two <b>coffins</b> without plaster frames were AD 1548 and AD 1571, respectively. Eight <b>coffins</b> with plaster frames yielded estimated dates from AD 1664 to AD 1799. The tree-ring dates indicated that the <b>coffins</b> with plaster frames in Shinnae-dong were constructed approximately 100 years later than those without plaster frames...|$|R
