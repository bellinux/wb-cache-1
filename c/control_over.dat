5|$|Gerrha – {{inhabited}} by Chaldean exiles from Babylon – controlled the Incense trade routes across Arabia to the Mediterranean and exercised <b>control</b> <b>over</b> the trading of aromatics to Babylon in the 1st century BCE. The Nabateans exercised <b>control</b> <b>over</b> the routes along the Incense Route, and their hold was challenged – without success – by Antigonus Cyclops, emperor of Syria. The Nabatean <b>control</b> <b>over</b> trade further increased and spread in many directions.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona's reign {{was marked}} by a {{struggle}} between France and Britain to secure <b>control</b> <b>over</b> Madagascar. The French, who held several small islands off Madagascar, were interested in gaining <b>control</b> <b>over</b> the main island but this move was opposed by the British who {{had an interest in}} maintaining a safe passage to India. Ranavalona pursued a policy of self-reliance to limit the influence of these foreign powers.|$|E

5|$|The {{conflict}} over the succession suggests that Offa needed to re-establish <b>control</b> <b>over</b> Mercia's traditional dependencies, {{such as the}} Hwicce and the Magonsæte. Charters dating from {{the first two years}} of Offa's reign show the Hwiccan kings as reguli, or kinglets, under his authority; and it is likely that he was also quick to gain <b>control</b> <b>over</b> the Magonsæte, for whom there is no record of an independent ruler after 740. Offa was probably able to exert <b>control</b> <b>over</b> the kingdom of Lindsey at an early date, as it appears that the independent dynasty of Lindsey had disappeared by this time.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{criticism}} {{from a number}} of people that the highly fragmented DG structure wastes a considerable amount of time in s as the different departments and Commissioners compete with each other.

5|$|Despite the coup's {{failure and}} his death, Abdallah {{had been able}} to {{consolidate}} his <b>control</b> <b>over</b> Mosul, becoming the virtual founder of a Hamdanid-ruled emirate there. During his long absences in Baghdad in his final years, Abdallah relegated authority over Mosul to his eldest son, al-Hasan, the future Nasir al-Dawla. After Abdallah's death, Hasan's position in Mosul was challenged by his uncles, and it was not until 935 {{that he was able to}} secure confirmation by Baghdad of his <b>control</b> <b>over</b> Mosul and the entire Jazira up to the Byzantine frontier.|$|E

By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more <b>control</b> <b>over</b> its trunk. After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.|$|E

Switzerland is an extreme case of there being no state <b>control</b> <b>over</b> who built castles, and as a result there were 4,000 in the country. There are very few castles dated with certainty from the mid-9thcentury. Converted into a donjon around 950, Château de Doué-la-Fontaine in France is the oldest standing castle in Europe.|$|E
