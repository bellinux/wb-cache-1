40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a systematic review of literature on the topic of parents’ views about <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>prevention</b> education.

Electronic database searches were conducted to identify relevant literature published in English relating to <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>prevention</b> programs and parent’s views. A total of 429 papers were evaluated with 13 studies identified as meeting the study’s inclusion criteria.

40|$|In this {{descriptive}} {{focus group}} study, we investigated parents’ views about <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>prevention</b> education {{at home and}} in schools. Focus groups were conducted with a sample of 30 Australian adults who identified as the parent or caregiver of a child/children aged 0 – 5 years. The study explored (1) parents’ knowledge about <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>prevention,</b> (2) the <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>prevention</b> messages they provided to their children and the topics they discussed, (3) their attitudes towards <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>prevention</b> education in schools, and (4) their preferences for content. Data analysis provided seven key themes in these four areas: knowledge (the inadequacy of their own prevention education; and how important is stranger danger now?); messages (bodies, touching, and relationships; the role of protective adults; and parent–child communication); attitudes (voice and choice); and preferences (not the nitty gritty, just the basics). The findings may be useful in assisting school authorities and providers of <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>prevention</b> programs to better understand parents’ contributions to <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>prevention</b> education, and their perspectives in relation to provision of school-based prevention programs...|$|R

25|$|The United States Federal <b>Child</b> <b>Abuse</b> <b>Prevention</b> and Treatment Act (CAPTA), {{as amended}} by The Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of 2003, defines {{child abuse and neglect}} as, at minimum: any recent act or failure to act {{on the part of a}} parent or caretaker, which results in death, serious {{physical}} or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation; or an act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm. A child is defined as a person under the age of eighteen. Within the parameters of CAPTA, each state is responsible for individually defining child abuse, neglect, and dependence and outline the care expected of parents and caregivers. In abuse cases, the most abused children are male aged from several months to 10 to 11 years old. The typical abusers are parents, live-in friends, guardians, or baby sitters, and only rarely by a sibling or other child.|$|E

Although the number of substantiated cases of <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> in the United States is startling, these astronomical statistics do not represent {{the total number of}} child sexual victimizations. Most children do not disclose their abuse, with reasons varying from embarrassment, a sense of normalization surrounding the abuse, and fear of consequences if they disclose the abuse (Palmer, Brown, Rae-Grant, & Laughlin, 1999). In the late 1970 s schools started implementing <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>prevention</b> programs to help with this problem (Kohl, 1993, cited in Roberts & Miltenberger, 1999). School <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>prevention</b> programs help promote disclosure of past abuse and prevent future abuse of students. The purpose of this research project was to examine the literature on <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>prevention</b> programs in schools to see what effects these programs have.

He noted that nearly 14,000 children in Michigan’s foster care system need homes, saying that allowing joint adoption by same-sex couples would expand the pool of potential parents for those children, which includes about 3,500 orphans. Sankaran added that if one of them adopts a child as a single person, which the state allows, the other has no legal rights to custody of the child if the other parent dies or is incapacitated.|$|E
