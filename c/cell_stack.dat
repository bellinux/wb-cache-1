The advantage of the technology presented here consists in its low cost, its simplicity, in its capability of rapidly assembling fuel <b>cell</b> <b>stacks</b> containing {{a large number of}} cells due to a passive compliance system of the end-effector and in its capability of accurately aligning the fuel cell components in the stack...|$|R
25|$|According to Toyota, the FCV {{features}} {{a fuel cell}} system with an output power density of 3.0kW/L, which is {{twice as high as}} that of its previous fuel cell concept, the Toyota FCHV-adv, delivering an output power of more than 100 kW, despite significant unit downsizing. The FCV uses Toyota's proprietary, small, light-weight fuel <b>cell</b> <b>stack</b> and two 70 MPa high-pressure hydrogen tanks placed beneath the specially designed body. The Toyota FCV concept can accommodate up to four occupants. For the full-scale market launch in 2015, the cost of the fuel cell system is expected to be 95% lower than that of the 2008 Toyota FCHV-adv.|$|E
25|$|At Toyota’s Higashi-Fuji Technical Center, the Mirai {{has been}} {{subjected}} to extensive crash testing to evaluate a design specifically intended to address frontal, side and rear impacts and to provide excellent protection of vehicle occupants. A high level of collision safety has also been achieved to help protect the fuel <b>cell</b> <b>stack</b> and high-pressure tanks against body deformation. The high pressure hydrogen tanks have excellent hydrogen permeation prevention performance, strength, and durability. Hydrogen sensors provide warnings and can shut off tank main stop valves. The hydrogen tanks and other hydrogen-related parts are located outside the cabin to ensure that if hydrogen leaks, it will dissipate easily. The vehicle structure is enhanced with carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers from Toray and designed to disperse and absorb impact energy across multiple parts to ensure a high-impact safety performance that protects the Toyota FC Stack and high-pressure hydrogen tanks during frontal, side or rear impacts.|$|E

2500|$|The {{challenge}} for the viability of PEM fuel cells today still remains in their cost and stability. The high cost can in large part {{be attributed to the}} use of the precious metal of platinum in the catalyst layer of PEM cells. The electrocatalyst currently accounts for nearly half of the fuel <b>cell</b> <b>stack</b> cost. Although the Pt loading of PEM fuel cells has been reduced by two orders of magnitude over the past decade, further reduction is necessary to make the technology economically viable for commercialization. Whereas some research efforts aim to address this issue by improving the electrocatalytic activity of Pt-based catalysts, an alternative is to eliminate the use of Pt altogether by developing a non-platinum-group-metal (non-PGM) cathode catalyst whose performance rivals that of Pt-based technologies. The U.S. Department of Energy has been setting milestones for the development of fuel cells, targeting a durability of 5000 hours and a non-PGM catalyst ORR volumetric activity of 300 A cm−3 ...|$|E

Different sealing materials partly with reinforcement by metallic or ceramic filler (particles or short fibers) are tested. The materials are tested after the joining procedure and after additional annealing at operation temperatures to test the effect of further crystallization that might take place. Furthermore, the effect of environmentally enhanced slow crack growth at low temperatures in water saturated atmosphere is investigated. Finally, self-healing effects of the glass ceramic materials with and without pre-annealing at typical operation temperatures are considered. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
