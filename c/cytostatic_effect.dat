40|$|Activated macrophages {{are able}} to inhibit the {{replication}} of intracellular microbes and tumor cells. In the murine system, this <b>cytostatic</b> <b>effect</b> {{is associated with the}} oxidation of L-arginine to L-citrulline, nitrite, and nitrate and is thought to be mediated by an intermediate of this reaction, possibly nitric oxide (NO). By exposing replicating Cryptococcus neoformans cells to conditions under which NO is chemically generated, we have observed a <b>cytostatic</b> <b>effect</b> similar to that caused by activated murine macrophages. Nitric oxide is formed as a decomposition product of nitrite salts in acidic, aqueous solutions. Although C. neoformans replicates well in the presence of high nitrite concentrations at physiologic pH, its growth in acidic media can be in-hibited by the addition of low concentrations of sodium nitrite. The degree of cytostasis is dependent on both the pH and the nitrite concentration of the NO generating solution. The cytostatic effector molecule appears to be a gas since, in addition to inhibiting C. neoformans replication in solution, it is able to exert its inhibitory effect across a gas-permeable but ion-impermeable membrane. At high nitrite concentrations, a fungicidal effect occurs. We propose that the growth inhibition of C. neoformans upon exposure to chemically generated NO or some related oxide of nitrogen represents a cell-free system simulating the <b>cytostatic</b> <b>effect</b> of activated murine macrophages.

Cell killing appears after several days of NS expression, suggesting that NS toxicity involved cellular factors. In this paper, we show that NS proteins are cytotoxic and interfere with the cell cycle in proliferating cells only NS expression is innocuous in resting cells, whereas in growing cells, it induces the accumulation of G 2 cells. This <b>cytostatic</b> <b>effect</b> is enhanced upon neoplastic transformation, which sensitized the cells to NS killing. Moreover, as clones resistant to NS toxicity undergo no alteration of their cycle, this <b>cytostatic</b> <b>effect</b> of NS proteins could be an early step on the way to cell killing.

40|$|Transforming {{growth factor}} β (TGFβ) {{is one of}} few known {{negative}} regulators of hematopoiesis, yet the mechanisms by which it affects cell cycle arrest and stem cell quiescence are poorly understood. Induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p 15 INK 4 b (p 15) and p 21 WAF 1 (p 21) is important for TGFβ-mediated cytostasis in epithelial cells but not in hematopoietic cells. Using primary human hematopoietic cells and microarray analysis, we identified p 57 KIP 2 (p 57) as the only cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor induced by TGFβ. Up-regulation of p 57 mRNA and protein occurs before TGFβ-induced G 1 cell cycle arrest, requires transcription, and is mediated via a highly conserved region of the proximal p 57 promoter. The up-regulation of p 57 is essential for TGFβ-induced cell cycle arrest in these cells, because two different small interfering RNAs that prevent p 57 up-regulation block the <b>cytostatic</b> <b>effects</b> of TGFβ on human hematopoietic cells. Reduction of basal p 57 expression by this approach also allows hematopoietic cells to proliferate more readily {{in the absence of}} TGFβ. p 57 is a putative tumor suppressor gene whose expression is frequently silenced by promoter hypermethylation in hematologic malignancies.

Both NAcCAP and NPrCAP show selective cytotoxicity towards melanoma cell lines. But the mechanism leading to selectivity is not clear as these drugs are also toxic to other cell lines to a lesser extent. Here we show that these drugs have both cytostatic and cytocidal effects, which could account for this. <b>Cytostatic</b> <b>effect</b> is suggested by DNA flow cytometry. The drug causes cell cycle changes in four human cell lines (normal skin fibroblasts, HeLa cells, and melanoma cell lines, C 32 and SK-MEL- 23) in a dose-dependent manner blocking cells in S phase with concomitant {{decrease in the number of}} cells in G 1 phase. There is also a gradual decrease in cells in G 2 + M phases. The dose–concentration curves give IC 50 values in the range of 50 – 400 μM and the melanotic melanoma cell line SK-MEL- 23 has the lowest IC 50 value consistent with our hypothesis that these drugs are selective towards melanoma cells. The concentration-dependent accumulation of cells in S phase suggest a <b>cytostatic</b> <b>effect</b> as a consequence of inhibition of DNA synthesis in agreement with [3 H] thymidine incorporation assay. There is a highly specific uptake of [14 C]NAcCAP and irreversible damage to DNA synthesis machinery in SK-MEL- 23 cells, indicating a melanotic-specific cytocidal effect as well. Trypan blue exclusion study and competitive inhibition assay indicated that visible cytocidal effect occurs slowly and oxidative stress resulting from tyrosinase mediated oxidation of the drug appears to be the underlying mechanism.

We compared four bisphosphonates at doses ranging from 10 (- 6) to 10 (- 4) M: clodronate, pamidronate, ibandronate and zoledronic acid. We analyzed cell cycle phases and assessed apoptotic effects of bisphosphonates by three different methods. RESULTS: Clodronate exhibited only a slight inhibitory effect on cell growth.
