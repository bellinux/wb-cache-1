New South Wales won all the fixtures except for one that was abandoned due to inclement weather. She scored 120 runs at 40.00, took six catches and made three stumpings, and was recalled to the senior team after one week in the second-string outfit. In her first three matches back, Healy was placed in the middle-order and not required to bat or keep wickets. In the last league match, she scored 59 from 55 balls in an 89-run partnership at faster than a run a ball with Lisa Sthalekar against Victoria. New South Wales won by three wickets despite losing Healy and three subsequent batsmen in the <b>closing</b> <b>phase</b> of the run-chase. In the final against the same team the following week, Healy made 11 from 22 balls before being run out, but New South Wales nevertheless won by six wickets with more than 15 overs to spare to claim the title. Healy ended the one-day competition with 79 runs at 26.33. She was named Australia's 30-strong shortlist for the 2009 Women's Cricket World Cup, but was not a part of the final squad of 15.|$|E

When Hungarian troops invaded Slovakia on March 23, 1939 and the subsequent Slovak–Hungarian War, Slovak troops occupied the school and returned Slovak language to the curriculum. This education highlighted growing Slovak national consciousness and nationalism. At this time the Head teacher was also the government commissioner of Michalovce and later the leader of the Hlinka Youth (Slovak paramilitary scout movement, modeled after the Hitler Youth). In school year 1939/40 that organization counted 118 of the schools students. Two years later the count was 590 boys and girls. In 1944 it was 694 students out of a total 875.

Results are presented for ten adult speakers with normal voices who sustained a set of vowels at a comfortable pitch and loudness. With electroglottography as reference, the identification rate and accuracy of glottal closure instants for the oral airflow are 96. 8 % and 0. 28 ms, whereas these metrics are 99. 4 % and 0. 10 ms for the acoustic signal.

But we English and Americans and Western Europeans generally had supposed that, so far as our own communities were concerned, this discontent was already anticipated and met by representative institutions. We had supposed that, with various safeguards and elaborations, our communities did, as a matter of fact, govern themselves. Our panacea for all discontents was the franchise. Social and national dissatisfaction could be given at the same time a voice and a remedy in the ballot box.

I do not dispute the existence of these women, or the veracity of those who have witnessed to them. I merely remark on the notable fact that only one of these victims, the Maidenhead girl, is described as having any home or parents. All the rest are boarders or birds of passage--a guest, a solitary dressmaker, a bachelor-girl doing typewriting. Lady Bullingdon, looking from her turrets, which she bought from the Whartons with the old soap-boiler's money when she jumped at marrying an unsuccessful gentleman from Ulster--Lady Bullingdon, looking out from those turrets, did really see an object which she describes as Green.

40|$|Abstract. Glottal inverse {{filtering}} is {{a technique}} used to derive the glottal waveform during voiced speech. <b>Closed</b> <b>phase</b> inverse filtering (CPIF) is a common approach for achieving this goal. During the <b>closed</b> <b>phase</b> there is no input to the vocal tract and hence the impulse response of the vocal tract can be determined through linear prediction. However, {{a number of problems}} are known to exist with the CPIF approach. This review paper briefly details the CPIF technique and highlights certain associated theoretical and methodological problems. An overview is then given of advanced methods for inverse filtering: model based, adaptive iterative, higher order statistics and cepstral approaches are examined. The advantages and disadvantages of these methods are highlighted. Outstanding issues and suggestions for further work are outlined. ...|$|R
