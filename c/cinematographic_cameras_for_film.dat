However, the Baird system, which used a mechanical <b>camera</b> <b>for</b> <b>filmed</b> programming and Farnsworth image dissector <b>cameras</b> <b>for</b> live programming, proved too cumbersome and visually inferior, and ended with closedown (at 22:00) on Saturday 13 February 1937.|$|R

Despite German production, the folding Super Ikonta was among the mainstays of British Army photographers during WWII.|$|R

He {{questioned the}} casting of Harvey as Isherwood, {{saying that the}} role called for a light comedic touch that was never Harvey's forte. Harvey's underplaying of the part, he wrote, clashes with Harris's unrestrained stage-style performance of hers. Still, {{he found that the}} film is [...] "an intriguing curio" [...] that garners interest for its exploration of the anti-Semitism that gave rise to the Nazis and for its handling of [...] "touchier aspects" [...] of the original sources, including Isherwood's homosexuality and Sally's abortion, which became a false pregnancy scare <b>for</b> the <b>film.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows the}} {{effectiveness}} of a <b>cinematographic</b> <b>camera</b> <b>for</b> controlling 3 D video by measuring its effects on viewers with several typical camera works. 3 D free-viewpoint video allows us to set its virtual camera on arbitrary positions and postures in 3 D space. However, there have been neither investigations on adaptability nor on dependencies between the camera parameters of the virtual camera (i. e., positions, postures, and transitions) nor the impressions of viewers. Although camera works on 3 D video based on expertise seems important for making intuitively understandable video, it has not yet been considered. When applying camera works to 3 D video using the planning techniques proposed in previous research, generating ideal output video is difficult because it may include defects due to image resolution limitation, calculation errors, or occlusions as well as others caused by positioning errors of the virtual camera in the planning process. Therefore, we conducted an experiment with 29 subjects with camera-worked 3 D videos created using simple annotation and planning techniques to determine the virtual camera parameters. The first point of the experiment examines the effects of defects on viewer impressions. To measure such impressions, we conducted a semantic differential (SD) test. Comparisons between ground truth and 3 D videos with planned camera works show that the present defects of camera work do not significantly affect viewers. The experiment 2 ̆ 7 s second point examines whether the cameras controlled by planning and annotations affected the subjects with intentional direction. For this purpose, we conducted a factor analysis for the SD test answers whose results indicate that the proposed virtual camera control, which exploits annotation and planning techniques, allows us to realize camera working direction on 3 D video...|$|R

5000|$|In movie cameras, the {{two most}} popular mounts in current usage on {{professional}} digital cinematography cameras are Arri's PL-mount and Panavision's PV-mount. The PL-Mount is used both on Arri and RED digital cinematography cameras, which [...] are the most used <b>cameras</b> <b>for</b> <b>films</b> shot in digital. The Panavision mounts are exclusively used with Panavision lenses, and thus are only available on Panaflex cameras or third-party cameras [...] "Panavised" [...] by a Panavision rental house, whereas the PL-mount style is favored with most other cameras and cine lens manufacturers. Both of these mounts are held in place with locating pins and friction locking rings. Other mounts which are now largely historical or a minority in relation to current practices are listed below.|$|R

50|$|In 2016, the BBC {{announced}} that {{footage of the}} first three expeditions had been unearthed by the BBC Natural History Unit that was found to have been shot in colour. At the time of the programme's inception in the 1950s, the BBC's film unit preferred 35 mm <b>film</b> <b>for</b> use in television programmes. However, 35 mm cameras were often big and unwieldy, and Attenborough wished to use the more lightweight, handheld 16 mm <b>film</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>for</b> <b>filming</b> Zoo Quest abroad. The BBC eventually relented, but only on the condition that colour film stock was used, as it gave the best picture quality for the format. (The BBC did not begin colour broadcasting until 1967 at the earliest). This film was then stored away and forgotten about, until 2015, when an archivist looking over the reels of film realised they were in fact in colour.|$|R
