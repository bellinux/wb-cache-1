25|$|Freud had {{likened the}} state of melancholia to {{mourning}} in his 1917 paper Mourning and Melancholia. He theorized that objective loss, such as {{the loss of a}} valued relationship through death or a romantic break-up, results in subjective loss as well; the depressed individual has identified with the object of affection through an unconscious, narcissistic process called the libidinal <b>cathexis</b> of the ego.|$|E
50|$|Peck {{seeks to}} {{differentiate}} between love and <b>cathexis.</b> <b>Cathexis</b> is what explains sexual attraction, the instinct for cuddling pets and pinching babies cheeks. However, <b>cathexis</b> is not love. All the same, true love cannot begin in isolation, {{a certain amount of}} <b>cathexis</b> is necessary to get sufficiently close to be able to truly love.|$|E
50|$|The Secord-Jourard Body <b>Cathexis</b> Scale {{introduced}} in the fifties, linking low body <b>cathexis</b> to low self-esteem, is still in use today. Otto Fenichel considered disturbances in body <b>cathexis</b> {{as one of the}} early accompaniments of schizophrenia, while empirical use of the Body <b>Cathexis</b> Scale subsequently found significant differences between schizophrenic patients and normal controls in this regard.|$|E
50|$|Body <b>cathexis</b> {{refers to}} person's {{investment}} of mental or emotional energy (<b>cathexis)</b> {{in their own}} body.|$|E
50|$|Freud defined <b>cathexis</b> as an {{investment}} of libido, pointing out for example how dream thoughts were cathected with different amounts of affect. A <b>cathexis</b> or emotional charge might be positive or negative, leading some of his followers to speak as well of a <b>cathexis</b> of mortido. Freud called a group of cathected ideas a complex.|$|E
50|$|M. Scott Peck {{distinguishes between}} love and <b>cathexis,</b> with <b>cathexis</b> being the initial in-love {{phase of a}} relationship, and love being the ongoing {{commitment}} of care.|$|E
5000|$|While {{investigating}} the apparent {{resurrection of the}} deceased Metamorpho, the League met the <b>Cathexis</b> {{for the first time}} and learned about Id; Metamorpho had been brought back by his son Joey's wish, but Joey had unfortunately wished that his father was back rather than alive, and so Id had translated his wish as such. Using the residual 'Id energies' left from the wish, the <b>Cathexis</b> were able to reverse the wish, and explained the situation to the League. Accompanied by the League, the <b>Cathexis</b> subsequently tracked Id to Los Angeles after it turned the entire city blind following a scarred beauty queen's yell of [...] "Don't look at me!!" [...] while on live television. With Id having been captured by Wonder Woman's lasso and the Flash's vibrations, the <b>Cathexis</b> showed their true colors and turned on the League.|$|E

50|$|Fortunately, Eel O'Brien - {{realizing the}} {{problems}} being {{faced by the}} divided Leaguers - had managed to gather the League's civilian identities together, the six civilians confronting the <b>Cathexis</b> while Eel attempted to use their equipment to reverse Superman's original wish. Unfortunately, so much time had passed {{that there was not}} enough energy to fully reverse the wish, and the 'merge' back consisted of a haphazard mess, with both personas struggling for dominance. As the <b>Cathexis</b> divided Aquaman into his fish and human sides, Wonder Woman, taking a last desperate gambit, tricked them into separating her soul of truth from her physical form, her spirit form thus able to reveal the truth to her six split teammates - that they were stronger together than apart. Using Id's power, the Flash divided the <b>Cathexis</b> from two six-dimensional creatures into four three-dimensional ones, the <b>Cathexis</b> subsequently being easily defeated by Batman. With this achieved, the League united around Id, channeling their combined desires into a wish for Id to destroy itself and banish the <b>Cathexis</b> back to their dimension, lacking the knowledge to ever recreate Id again.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cathexis</b> is {{the process}} of hh {{investment}} of mental or emotional energy in a person, object, or idea.|$|E
50|$|Positive {{interdependence}} {{can also}} be understood by its effects on the psychological processes of learners in a group setting. It promotes substitutability (the degree to which actions of one group member substitutes {{for the actions of}} another), positive <b>cathexis</b> (investment of positive psychological energy in objects outside one's self), and inducibility (openness to influencing and being influenced by others), whereas Negative Interdependence creates nonsubstituability, negative <b>cathexis</b> and a resistance to being influenced by others.|$|E

50|$|In Incredible Hulk #610, Amadeus, {{along with}} {{hundreds}} of others, is zapped with the <b>Cathexis</b> Ray, which further enhances his intelligence. It also allows him to alter {{the laws of physics}} within a ten-foot radius of himself. He uses this power to shut down the Leader's equipment and revert MODOK to his original human form. He loses this power when Bruce Banner uses a recalibrated <b>Cathexis</b> Ray to remove the powers of the newly created Hulks.|$|E

50|$|Critics {{charge that}} the term {{provides}} a potentially misleading neurophysiological analogy, which might be applicable to the <b>cathexis</b> of ideas but certainly not of objects.|$|E

50|$|Freud saw {{thinking}} as an experimental process involving minimal amounts of <b>cathexis,</b> “in {{the same way}} as a general shifts small figures about on a map”.|$|E
5000|$|Further {{ambiguity}} in Freud's usage emerges in {{the contrast between}} <b>cathexis</b> as a measurable load of (undifferentiated) libido, and as a qualitatively distinct type of affect - as in a [...] "cathexis of longing".|$|E
50|$|In narcissistic neurosis, <b>cathexis</b> is {{withdrawn}} from external instinctual objects (or rather their unconscious representations) {{and turned on}} the ego - a process Freud highlighted in the Schreber case, and linked to the subject's ensuing megalomania.|$|E
5000|$|The Greek term <b>cathexis</b> (κάθεξις) {{was chosen}} by James Strachey to render the German term Besetzung in his {{translation}} of Sigmund Freud's complete works. Freud himself wrote of [...] "interest (Besetzung)", in an early letter to Ernest Jones.|$|E
5000|$|Peter Gay objected that Strachey's use of <b>cathexis</b> was an {{unnecessarily}} esoteric {{replacement for}} Freud's use of Besetzung - [...] "a word from common German speech rich in suggestive meanings, among them 'occupation' (by troops) and 'charge' (of electricity)".|$|E
50|$|Freud saw {{the early}} <b>cathexis</b> of objects with libidinal energy {{as a central}} aspect of human development. In {{describing}} the withdrawal of cathexes which accompanied the mourning process, Freud provided his major contribution to the foundation of object relations theory.|$|E
50|$|Jaqui Lee Schiff {{conducted}} a study to attain biochemical evidence for reparenting’s effectiveness on schizophrenics. Schiff based this study on the observation that individuals with schizophrenia tend to have low levels of tryptophan reuptake. In the study, 20 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia were divided into three groups: a group going through reparenting treatment at the <b>Cathexis</b> Institute, a group going through separate treatment at the Lafayette Institute, and a control group that did not receive reparenting treatment. The {{results show that the}} subjects going through reparenting treatment at the <b>Cathexis</b> and Lafayette Institute had a mean tryptophan reuptake of 3.32 and 3.75 respectively. The control group had a group mean of 2.13. The numbers show that subjects that received reparenting had significantly higher tryptophan reuptake {{at the end of the}} experiment.|$|E

5000|$|Freud {{used the}} term [...] "anti-cathexis" [...] or counter-charge to {{describe}} how the ego blocks such regressive efforts to discharge one's cathexis: that is, when the ego wishes to repress such desires. Like a steam engine, the libido's <b>cathexis</b> then builds up until it finds alternative outlets, {{which can lead to}} sublimation, reaction formation, or the construction of (sometimes disabling) symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|Body <b>cathexis</b> drives {{multiple}} behaviors, such as clothing {{choices and}} weight management, and cosmetics purchases. Studies {{show that people}} are more satisfied with their hair and eyes than their waists. [...] Consumers who were more satisfied with their bodies were more frequent users of such preening products as hair conditioner, blow dryers, cologne, facial bronzer, tooth polish and pumice soap.|$|E
