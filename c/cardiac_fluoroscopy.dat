40|$|A {{retrospective}} analysis {{was made of}} the source of medical radiation received by 25 children who were investigated by cardiac catheterization techniques and followed in the Cardiac Outpatient Clinic of the Health Centre for Children, Vancouver General Hospital. The source of radiation was analyzed. The r dose per year received from plane films averaged 0. 05 r, from <b>cardiac</b> <b>fluoroscopy</b> 6. 7 r, and from catheterization and angiocardiography studies 1. 58 r per year. In six of the 25 children, radiation doses to the thorax exceeded the LD 50 for adult humans. In these six patients 95. 8 % of the radiation received was during <b>cardiac</b> <b>fluoroscopy.</b> Routine fluoroscopy for the radiological re-evaluation of pediatric patients with congenital heart disease should be replaced by plain chest radiographs...|$|E
40|$|Several {{diagnostic}} noninvasive {{tests to}} detect coronary and multivessel coronary disease {{are available for}} women. However, all are imperfect {{and it is not}} yet clear whether one particular test provides substantially more information than others. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate clinical findings, exercise electrocardiography, exercise thallium myocardial scintigraphy and <b>cardiac</b> <b>fluoroscopy</b> in 92 symptomatic women without previous infarction and determine which tests were most useful in determining the presence of coronary disease and its severity. Univariate analysis revealed two clinical, eight exercise electrocardiographic, seven myocardial scintigraphic and seven fluoroscopic variables predictive of coronary or multivessel disease with 70 % or greater stenosis. The multivariate discriminant function analysis selected a reversible thallium defect, coronary calcification and character of chest pain syndrome (p ¼ 0. 05) as the variables most predictive of presence or absence of coronary disease. The ranked order of variables most predictive of multivessel disease were <b>cardiac</b> <b>fluoroscopy</b> score, thallium score and extent of ST segment depression in 14 electrocardiographic leads. Each provided statistically significant information to the model. The estimate of predictive accuracy was 89 % for coronary disease and 97 % for multivessel coronary disease. The results suggest that <b>cardiac</b> <b>fluoroscopy</b> or thallium scintigraphy provide significantly more diagnostic information than exercise electrocardiography in women over a wide range of clinical patient subsets...|$|E
40|$|Detection of postinfarction aneurysms of {{the left}} {{ventricle}} has become increasingly important {{with the development of}} surgical techniques for the treatment of this lesion.

40|$|Background: Catheter {{ablation}} is {{a treatment}} that can cure various <b>cardiac</b> arrhythmias. <b>Fluoroscopy</b> {{is used to}} locate and direct catheters to areas that cause arrhythmias. However, fluoroscopy has several risks. Electroanatomic mapping (EAM) facilitates three-dimensional imaging without X-rays, which reduces risks associated with fluoroscopy. Objective: We describe a series of patient cases wherein cardiac arrhythmia ablation was exclusively performed using EAM. Methods: Patients who presented with cardiac arrhythmias that were unresponsive to pharmacological therapy were prospectively selected between March 2011 and March 2012 for arrhythmia ablation exclusively through EAM. Patients with indications for a diagnostic electrophysiology study and ablation of atrial fibrillation, left atrial tachyarrhythmias as well as hemodynamically unstable ventricular arrhythmia were excluded. We documented the procedure time, success rate and complications as well as whether fluoroscopy was necessary during the procedure. Results: In total, 11 patients {{were enrolled in the}} study, including seven female patients (63 %). The mean age of the patients was 50 years (SD ± 16. 5). Indications for the investigated procedures included four cases (35 %) of atrial flutter, three cases (27 %) of pre-excitation syndrome, two cases (19 %) of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and two cases (19 %) of ventricular extrasystoles. The mean procedure duration was 86. 6 min (SD ± 26 min). Immediate success (at discharge) of the procedure was evident for nine patients (81 %). There were no complications during the procedures...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe recent {{availability}} of three-dimensional (3 D) transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) provides cardiologists with real-time 3 D imaging of <b>cardiac</b> anatomy. X-ray <b>fluoroscopy</b> is the conventional modalilty {{that is used}} for guiding many cardiac interventions. Increasingly this is now supported using intra-procedure 3 D TEE imaging. We hypothesize that the real-time coregistration and visualization of 3 D TEE and X-ray fluoroscopy data will provide a powerful guidance tool for cardiologists. In this paper, we propose a novel, robust and efficient method for performing this registration. Our method consists of an image-based TEE probe localization algorithm and a calibration procedure. While the calibration {{needs to be done}} only once, the registration takes approximately 9. 5 seconds to complete. The accuracy of our method was assessed by using both a crosswire phantom and a more realistic heart phantom. The target registration error for the heart phantom was less than 2 mm. In addition, the accuracy and the clinical feasiblity of our method was evaluated in two cardiac electrophysiology procedures. The registration results showed inplane errors of 1. 5 and 3 mm...|$|R
40|$|Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) {{are among}} the most common {{congenital}} cardiac lesions. Large defects at apicomuscular regions, especially in young patients, are far from accessible to surgeons for conventional surgery. Moreover, the transcatheter closure of VSDs in these patients is difficult and carries a high risk of complications because of the large sheath size relative to the patient’s size. The periventricular approach simplifies VSD closure and, thus, eliminates the potential complications of <b>cardiac</b> catheterization and <b>fluoroscopy</b> as it is performed under echocardiographic guidance. A 3 -year-old girl with a body weight of 11 kg (failure to thrive) was referred to us. She had multiple adjacent apicomuscular VSDs, the largest one being about 19 mm in diameter, and subsystemic pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). The patient underwent periventricular apicomuscular VSD closure with a Lifetech muscular VSD occluder (size 22 mm) under epicardial echocardiography guidance without cardiopulmonary bypass.   Post procedure, the PAP was decreased to mild level. The residual shunt was mild across the adjacent small defects. She was discharged after 7 days without complications. At 2 years’ follow-up, the patient was hemodynamically stable and had a normal PAP (PAP = about 16 mmHg) by transthoracic echocardiographic assessment. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{clinical}} and investigatory findings in five instances of major detachment of an aortic valve prosthesis in four patients are described. This situation {{was associated with}} auscultatory and peripheral signs of aortic regurgitation and, in addition, a mid-diastolic murmur in the mitral area. From the haemodynamic and operative findings it was postulated that, in addition to severe aortic regurgitation, disturbance of mitral valve function occurred both in systole and diastole caused by the pivoting of the prosthesis attached {{to the base of}} the aortic leaflet of the mitral valve. <b>Cardiac</b> <b>fluoroscopy</b> confirmed the diagnosis...|$|E

40|$|Because {{it will be}} {{some time}} before the primary {{prevention}} of cardiovascular disease is a reality, it is advisable to evaluate screening methods for detecting latent cardiovascular disease. Because risk factor screening and techniques with the patient at rest have limited sensitivity, exercise testing that brings out abnormalities not present at rest deserves consideration. Numerous studies have shown the exercise electrocardiogram to have a sensitivity of approximately 50 % and a specificity of 90 %. The different reported predictive values are related to its use in populations with different prevalences of disease. Various techniques have been recommended to improve the sensitivity and specificity of exercise testing, including other exercise measurements, computerized probability estimates, nuclear cardiology, cardio-kymography, <b>cardiac</b> <b>fluoroscopy</b> and risk factor analysis. There is promise that these techniques will improve attempts to screen asymptomatic subjects for coronary disease...|$|E
40|$|Twelve {{subjects}} with type II hyperlipoproteine-mia (elevated low density lipoprotein choles-terol) were studied (table 1). Informed {{consent was obtained}} from all subjects according to National Institutes of Health guidelines. Patients abstained from all medications known to affect platelet function; medications to control lipid levels are indicated in table 1. We studied 35 normal controls, aged 18 to 32 years, who showed no evidence of atheroscle-rotic disease, and who had normal fasting lipid levels and no history of platelet dysfunction. Of these controls, 10 also underwent 51 Cr platelet survival measurement. Controls also avoided all medications known to affect platelet function dur-ing the study period. Lipoprotein Type Classification Lipoprotein phenotypes and genotypes were established by clinical appearance, fasting cho-lesterol and triglyceride levels, paper electropho-resis of plasma lipoproteins, family studies, low density lipoprotein receptor studies, and quanti-tative ultracentrifugation of plasma lipopro-teins. 12 " 14 Patients were classified as MA if their low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was ele-vated and their very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol was normal; they were classi-fied as I IB if both their VLDL and LDL cholesterol levels were elevated.

40|$|A {{microcomputer}} {{program called}} CADENZA, which employs Bayes' theorem {{to analyze and}} report the results of various clinical descriptors and noninvasive tests relative to the diagnosis of coronary artery disease, was evaluated in 1, 097 consecutive patients without previous myocardial infarction. With this program, each patient was characterized by a probability for coronary artery disease, based on Framingham risk factor analysis, symptom characterization, electrocardiographic stress testing, cardiokymography, <b>cardiac</b> <b>fluoroscopy,</b> thallium perfusion scintigraphy and technetium equilibrium-gated blood pool scintigraphy. A total of 11, 808 probability estimates derived from various combinations of the available observations were analyzed: 2, 180 in 170 patients undergoing coronary angiography and 9, 628 in 969 patients who completed a 1 year follow-up for coronary events. The predicted probability of disease correlated linearly with observed angiographic prevalence in the 170 patients who subsequently had coronary angiography (prevalence = [0. 001 ± 0. 011] + [0. 966 ± 0. 019] x probability). The difference between probability and prevalence averaged 3. 1 %, and {{the magnitude of this}} correlation was not affected by the type or amount of data analyzed. The prevalence of multivessel disease in these patients increased as a monotonic function of disease probability. Below a probability of 25 %, single vessel disease was slightly more common than multivessel disease. Above a probability of 75 %, multivessel disease predominated. In the 969 patients followed up for 1 year from the date of testing, the incidence of cardiac death and nonfatal infarction increased as a cubic function of disease probability (from approximately 0 to 8 % per year for each). Above a probability of 90 %, however, the standard deviation for predicting these events was wide. These data indicate that Bayes' theorem in general— and CADENZA in particular—is an accurate, clinically applicable means for quantifying the prevalence of angiographic coronary artery disease, the risk of multivessel disease and the incidence of morbid coronary events in the year after testing...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of {{multiple}} noninvasive tests offers {{the promise of}} more accurate diagnosis of coronary artery disease, but discordant test responses can occur frequently and, when observed, result in diagnostic uncertainty. Accordingly, 43 patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography were evaluated by noninvasive testing and the results subjected to analysis using Bayes' theorem of conditional probability. The procedures used included electrocardiographic stress testing for detection of exercise-induced ST segment depression, cardiokymographic stress testing for detection of exercise-induced precordial dyskinesis, myocardial perfusion scintigraphy for detection of exercise-induced relative regional hypoperfusion, and <b>cardiac</b> <b>fluoroscopy</b> for detection of coronary artery calcification. The probability for coronary artery disease was estimated by Bayes' theorem from each patient's age, sex, and symptom classification, and from the observed test responses. This analysis revealed a significant linear correlation between the predicted probability for coronary artery disease and the observed prevalence of angiographic disease over {{the entire range of}} probability from 0 to 100 % (P less than 0. 001 by linear regression). The 12 patients without angiographic disease had a mean posttest likelihood of only 7. 0 +/- 2. 6 % despite the fact that 13 of the 60 historical and test responses were falsely "positive. " In contrast, the mean posttest likelihood was 94. 1 +/- 2. 8 % in the 31 patients with angiographic coronary artery disease, although 45 of the 155 historical and test responses were falsely "negative. " In 8 of the 12 normal patients, the final posttest likelihood was under 10 % and in 26 of the 31 coronary artery disease patients, it was over 90 %. These estimates also correlated well with the pooled clinical judgment of five experienced cardiologists (P less than 0. 001 by linear regression). The observed change in probability for disease for each of the 15 different test combinations correlated with their information content predicted according to Shannon's theorem (P less than 0. 001 by linear regression). These results support the use of probability analysis in the clinical diagnosis of coronary artery disease and provide a formal basis for comparing the relative diagnostic effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different test combinations...|$|E
