It has been compared with the much larger Nile river on Earth. This feature is connected to Ligeia Mare. Later, a paper ("Liquid-filled Canyons on Titan") published on Geophysical Research Letters on 9 August 2016 reported about the May 2013 Cassini RADAR altimeter observation of Vid Flumina channels, defined as a drainage network connected to Titan's second largest hydrocarbon sea, Ligeia Mare. Analysis of the received altimeter echoes showed that the channels are located in deep (up to ~570 m), steep-sided, canyons and have strong specular surface reflections that indicate they are currently liquid filled. Elevations of the liquid in these channels are {{at the same level}} as Ligeia Mare to within a vertical precision of about 0.7 m, consistent with the interpretation of drowned river valleys. Specular reflections are also observed in lower order tributaries elevated above the level of Ligeia Mare, consistent with drainage feeding into the main <b>channel</b> <b>system.</b> This is likely the first direct evidence of the presence of liquid channels on Titan and the first observation of hundred-meter deep canyons on Titan. Vid Flumina canyons are thus drowned by the sea {{but there are a few}} isolated observations to attest to the presence of surface liquids standing at higher elevations.|$|E

25|$|In 1956, the {{government}} of Puerto Rico expropriated most of the lands of Buena Vista, {{as a result of}} a new law to provide land to local farmers. Only 87 acres of land remained with the Vives, including the manor house and the water <b>channel</b> <b>system.</b> These were acquired by the Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico in 1984. In 1986, the Trust restored the hacienda to much of its past glory and turned it into a museum. It opened in 1987. The museum has operated continuously for 23 years. It is the only such museum in Puerto Rico. In 1988, the Trust entirely reconstructed the coffee mill to its 1892 look. While the Vives family had rebuilt their coffee mill after 1928, the Trust chose to reconstruct an approximation of the earlier coffee mill of 1892.|$|E
500|$|The Imperial County Services building, a six-story {{reinforced}} concrete building located [...] {{northwest of the}} epicenter in El Centro, was built in 1971 when there were few other tall buildings in the area. The decision to equip the building with nine strong motion sensors in May 1976 was based on its size, structural attributes, and location in a seismically active area. Unusually detailed structural analysis was possible {{as a result of}} the building having been outfitted with the instrumentation. The initial configuration was tested shortly after its installation when a relatively small (4.9 local magnitude) earthquake occurred [...] northwest of the building on November 4, 1976. The accelerations recorded on the equipment during the event proved to be of very low amplitude and, as a result, the instrumentation was upgraded to include a 13 channel configuration in the building along with a Kinemetrics triaxial (3 channel) accelerograph located [...] east of the building at ground level. The full 16 <b>channel</b> <b>system</b> was managed by the California Division of Mines and Geology Office of Ground Motion Studies and provided almost 60 seconds worth of high resolution data during the 1979 event.|$|E
