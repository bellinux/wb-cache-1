The dynamic model structure adopted for the battery cell is based on an equivalent circuit whose parameters are generated using real cycling data through an optimisation routine written in the Modelica language.

The cell and scaled-up pack model is parameterised for a number of commercially available cells ranging a number of <b>cell</b> <b>formats,</b> sizes and chemistries.

50|$|The flow <b>cell</b> <b>format</b> is most {{commonly}} implemented in hematology instruments, and sometimes flow cytometers. In this format, electrodes are embedded {{at either end}} of a flow channel and the electric field is applied through the channel. This format has several advantages as opposed to the aperture format. This arrangement allows for continuous sample analysis whereas the aperture format is single-batch format. Further, the use of a flow cell lends itself to addition of a sheath flow, which keeps particles centered {{in the middle of the}} flow channel. This allows measurements to be performed simultaneously, such as probing the object with a laser. The major disadvantages of the flow <b>cell</b> <b>format</b> are that it is much more expensive to manufacture and is typically fixed to one channel width, whereas the aperture format offers a wide variety of aperture sizes.|$|E

40|$|Much like {{books in}} a library, {{microbiological}} strains {{must be able}} to be stored over prolonged periods of time, while maintaining their condition and accessibility for the purposes ofresearch and reference. Many methods currently employed for the storing of microorganisms require highly specialized storage systems; substantial technical equipment; know-how and temperature controlled environments. Whilst these methods are effective, it is accepted that they can be expensive and technically demanding. Traditionally, methods ofevaluating novel storage techniques require the use of classical bacterial enumeration techniques, which are slow, labour intensive and expensive to automate. This work investigates the use of in-vivo bacterial bioluminescence as an alternative bacterial enumeration tool to aid the identification of novel preservatives and preservation formats for the quantitative and qualitative preservation of bacteria. The development of a cheap, simple, yet effective storage alternative to current preservation systems based on a novel self-drying concept, containing activated charcoal and sucrose protectant is reported. In addition, the evaluation of DNA transformed bacteria using plasmids containing lux gene cassettes was studied in order to assess transformation efficiencies in competent cells. Currently, competent cells are distributed and stored at very low temperatures in order to maintain their viability and competence, therefore, the demand for a technology that will alleviate the need for handling and storing of competent cells at sub-zero temperaturesÃ‚Â· is certainly present. However, methods employed in screening and developing new competent <b>cell</b> <b>formats</b> often rely on classical enumeration techniques. Therefore, the development of a fast screening tool in the form of bioluminescence would aid the development of novel competent <b>cell</b> <b>formats.</b> To this aim, a fast screening tool for the identification of positive competent cell. formulations was investigated.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{framework}} for real-time multimedia transmission in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks using an efficient traffic scheduling scheme called mul-tilayer gated frame queueing (MGFQ). MGFQ employs only one set of FIFO queues to provide {{a wide range of}} QoS for real-time ap-plications. We also propose special <b>cell</b> <b>formats</b> for real-time mul-timedia transport and a hybrid design to allow MGFQ to com-bine its scheduling scheme with Age Priority Packet Discarding scheme. For this hybrid design, the cell level performance as well as the packet level QoS can be improved at the same time. Simu-lation results show that this hybrid design will be useful for pack-etized voice and progressive layer-compressed video transmission across the backbone networks. With the presented framework and the MGFQ algorithm, real-time multimedia traffic streams can be much better supported in terms of cell/packet delay and jitter.

40|$|In this work, a novel acausal and {{reconfigurable}} {{battery pack}} model is presented. The model structure adopted for the battery cell {{is based on}} an equivalent circuit representation. The circuit elements are modified to take account of both hysteresis and diffusion limitation. The latter is known to be a nonlinear function of large operating currents or long operating times. It is shown that the integration of a current dependent time constant within the cell model better emulates the solid diffusional dynamics of lithium intercalation into the active material under large electrical loads. The advantages of an acausal modeling approach, when scaling-up individual cell models into a complete battery system are also presented. Particular consideration is given to emulating the impact of cell to cell variations on pack performance. Using statistical analysis of battery tests, cell model parameter variations are characterized and quantified. The cell and scaled-up pack model are parameterized for a number of commercially available <b>cell</b> <b>formats,</b> energy capacities and chemistries.

40|$|AbstractIncreasing modules voltage allows {{to reduce}} {{resistive}} losses and metal consumption. Reaching voltages of several hundreds of volts may also enable inverter simplification leading to {{more efficient and}} lower cost inverter systems. This study proposes to evaluate the feasibility of such modules using reduced area solar cells fabricated by laser scribing and subsequent mechanical cleavage of 6 inches Al-BSF silicon cells. First, we investigated {{the influence of the}} cell dimension on the efficiency. Due to a high recombination activity on the cell edges, a drastic loss in efficiency can be observed for samples area below 16 cm 2. For a given area, the comparison of two <b>cell</b> <b>formats</b> (45 × 45 mm 2 and 78 × 26 mm 2) confirms the interest of reducing the peripheral length over the cell area (square shape). The optimization of the front metallization grid allows the fabrication of small area cells with similar efficiency as 6 inches cells. Finally, a high voltage module was fabricated with 45 × 45 mm 2 cells allowing to reach an open-circuit voltage of 369 V, a high FF value of 78. 7 % and a gain of 1. 3 % absolute efficiency compared to the reference module...|$|R

50|$|The {{shape of}} the {{generated}} electrical pulse varies with the particle path through the aperture. Shoulders and other artifacts can occur because the electric field density varies across {{the diameter of the}} aperture. This variance is a result of both the physical constriction of the electric field and also the fact that the liquid velocity varies as a function of radial location in the aperture. In the flow <b>cell</b> <b>format,</b> this effect is minimized since sheath flow ensures each particle travels an almost identical path through the flow cell. In the aperture format, signal processing algorithms can be used to correct for artifacts resulting from particle path.|$|E

The increasing demand for cells suited for LEO applications, made AZUR to develop a novel upright metamorphic triple junction solar cell with a BOL efficiency of 31 % designed for a fluence of 1 E 14 cm− 2 1 MeV electrons. This cell design is already in production. AZUR’s next generation product 4 G 32 comprises an upright metamorphic 4 -junction device with 28. 5 % EOL (1 E 15 cm− 2 1 MeV electrons) efficiency.
