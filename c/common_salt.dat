5|$|Free {{hydrochloric}} acid was first formally {{described in the}} 16th century by Libavius, who prepared it by heating salt in clay crucibles. Other authors claim that pure {{hydrochloric acid}} was first discovered by the German Benedictine monk Basil Valentine in the 15th century, when he heated <b>common</b> <b>salt</b> and green vitriol, whereas others {{argue that there is}} no clear reference to the preparation of pure hydrochloric acid {{until the end of the}} 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Hydrochloric acid is {{used for}} {{a large number of}} {{small-scale}} applications, such as leather processing, purification of <b>common</b> <b>salt,</b> household cleaning, and building construction. Oil production may be stimulated by injecting hydrochloric acid into the rock formation of an oil well, dissolving a portion of the rock, and creating a large-pore structure. Oil well acidizing is a common process in the North Sea oil production industry.|$|E
5|$|During the Industrial Revolution in Europe, {{demand for}} {{alkaline}} substances increased. A new industrial process developed by Nicolas Leblanc of Issoundun, France enabled cheap large-scale production of sodium carbonate (soda ash). In this Leblanc process, <b>common</b> <b>salt</b> {{is converted to}} soda ash, using sulfuric acid, limestone, and coal, releasing hydrogen chloride as a by-product. Until the British Alkali Act 1863 and similar legislation in other countries, the excess HCl was vented into the air. After {{the passage of the}} act, soda ash producers were obliged to absorb the waste gas in water, producing hydrochloric acid on an industrial scale.|$|E
50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>salts</b> are hordenine hydrochloride, R-NH3+Cl−, m.p. 178 °C, and hordenine sulfate, (R-NH3+)2SO42−, m.p. 211 °C.|$|R

5|$|Hydrochloric acid was {{historically}} called acidum salis, muriatic acid, {{and spirits}} of salt {{because it was}} produced from rock salt and green vitriol (by Basilius Valentinus in the 15th century) and later from the chemically similar <b>common</b> <b>salt</b> and sulfuric acid (by Johann Rudolph Glauber in the 17th century). Free hydrochloric acid was first formally described in the 16th century by Libavius. Later, it was used by chemists such as Glauber, Priestley, and Davy in their scientific research.|$|E

5|$|Chlorine is {{produced}} from sodium chloride (<b>common</b> <b>salt,</b> NaCl) using electrolysis {{to separate the}} metallic sodium from the chlorine gas. Usually the salt is dissolved in water to produce a brine. By-products of any such chloralkali process are hydrogen (H2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which is commonly called caustic soda or lye. By far the largest use of mercury in the late 20th century was in the mercury cell process (also called the Castner-Kellner process) where metallic sodium is formed as an amalgam at a cathode made from mercury; this sodium is then reacted with water to produce sodium hydroxide. Many of the industrial mercury releases of the 20th century came from this process, although modern plants claimed to be safe in this regard. After about 1985, all new chloralkali production facilities that {{were built in the}} United States used membrane cell or diaphragm cell technologies to produce chlorine.|$|E

5|$|Sodium and {{potassium}} occur in all known biological systems, generally functioning as electrolytes {{inside and outside}} cells. Sodium is an essential nutrient that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500milligrams per day. Sodium chloride (also known as <b>common</b> <b>salt)</b> is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative, such as for pickling and jerky; most of it comes from processed foods. The Dietary Reference Intake for sodium is 1.5grams per day, but {{most people in the}} United States consume more than 2.3grams per day, the minimum amount that promotes hypertension; this in turn causes 7.6 million premature deaths worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{evaporation}} ponds at {{the edges}} of the lake produce salts and brine (water with high salt quantity). Minerals extracted from the lake include: sodium chloride (<b>common</b> <b>salt),</b> used in water softeners, salt lick blocks for livestock, and to melt ice on local roadways (food-grade salt is not produced from the lake, as it would require further costly processing to ensure its purity); potassium sulfate, used as a commercial fertilizer; and magnesium-chloride brine, used in the production of magnesium metal, chlorine gas, and as a dust suppressant. US Magnesium operates a plant on the southwest shore of the lake, which produces 14 percent of the worldwide supply of magnesium, more than any other North American magnesium operation. Mineral-extraction companies operating on the lake pay royalties on their products to the State of Utah, which owns the lake.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{are among the}} most {{electropositive}} elements on the periodic table and thus tend to bond ionically to the most electronegative elements on the periodic table, the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine), forming salts known as the alkali metal halides. The reaction is very vigorous and can sometimes result in explosions. All twenty stable alkali metal halides are known; the unstable ones are not known, with the exception of sodium astatide, because of the great instability and rarity of astatine and francium. The most well-known of the twenty is certainly sodium chloride, otherwise known as <b>common</b> <b>salt.</b> All of the stable alkali metal halides have the formula MX where M is an alkali metal and X is a halogen. They are all white ionic crystalline solids that have high melting points. All the alkali metal halides are soluble in water except for lithium fluoride (LiF), which is insoluble in water due to its very high lattice enthalpy. The high lattice enthalpy of lithium fluoride is due to the small sizes of the Li+ and F− ions, causing the electrostatic interactions between them to be strong: a similar effect occurs for magnesium fluoride, consistent with the diagonal relationship between lithium and magnesium.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} adjuvants, {{some of which}} are {{inorganic}} (such as alum), that also carry the potential to augment immunogenicity. Two <b>common</b> <b>salts</b> include aluminium phosphate and aluminium hydroxide. These are the most common adjuvants in human vaccines.|$|R
50|$|Koshering salt, usually {{referred}} to as kosher salt, is a variety of edible salt popular in the US which has much larger grain size than some <b>common</b> table <b>salt.</b> Like <b>common</b> table <b>salt,</b> kosher salt consists mainly of the chemical compound sodium chloride.|$|R
50|$|Potassium hydrogenoxalate, {{also known}} as {{potassium}} bioxalate, is a salt with formula KHC2O4 or K+·HO2C-CO2&minus;.

25|$|Sodium carbonate, {{also known}} as soda ash, is an {{effective}} industrial alkali. The manufacture of sodium carbonate from <b>common</b> <b>salt</b> was first developed in France in the 1790s and known as the Leblanc process. Muspratt was attracted towards manufacturing it, but could not raise the capital for the relatively expensive Leblanc plant and also considered that Dublin was not a suitable location for this. He perceived Merseyside as better because of the neighbouring coal fields, the proximity to the salt district of Cheshire, and the proximity to glassmaking industry. The glassmakers were the main prospective customer base for the sodium carbonate alkali.|$|E
25|$|Gold parting {{had been}} well used {{throughout}} the ancient times {{but only in the}} Medieval period were clear and detailed descriptions of the processes written. All the archaeological finds of Roman and early medieval parting point to a solid state process using <b>common</b> <b>salt</b> as the active ingredient. The only large group of medieval parting vessels so far discovered were found at Coppergate and Picadilly sites in York. The pinkish-purple discolouration of the vessels showed them to have been used with the salt cementation process which removes iron from the clay as ferric chloride. Other vessel fragments are known from Carlisle and Winchester. Theophilus was a 12th-century German monk and in his book De Diversus Artibus gives the clearest description of the salt cementation process.|$|E
25|$|Plant species {{diversity}} is relatively low, since the flora must be tolerant of salt, complete or partial submersion, and anoxic mud substrate. The most <b>common</b> <b>salt</b> marsh plants are glassworts (Salicornia spp.) and the cordgrass (Spartina spp.), which have worldwide distribution. They {{are often the}} first plants to take hold in a mudflat and begin its ecological succession into a salt marsh. Their shoots lift the main flow of the tide above the mud surface while their roots spread into the substrate and stabilize the sticky mud and carry oxygen into it so that other plants can establish themselves as well. Plants such as sea lavenders (Limonium spp.), plantains (Plantago spp.), and varied sedges and rushes grow once the mud has been vegetated by the pioneer species.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} {{disinfection}} method involves {{some form of}} chlorine or its compounds such as chloramine or chlorine dioxide. Chlorine is a strong oxidant that rapidly kills many harmful micro-organisms. Because chlorine is a toxic gas, {{there is a danger}} of a release associated with its use. This problem is avoided by the use of sodium hypochlorite, which is a relatively inexpensive solution used in household bleach that releases free chlorine when dissolved in water. Chlorine solutions can be generated on site by electrolyzing <b>common</b> <b>salt</b> solutions. A solid form, calcium hypochlorite, releases chlorine on contact with water. Handling the solid, however, requires greater routine human contact through opening bags and pouring than the use of gas cylinders or bleach which are more easily automated. The generation of liquid sodium hypochlorite is both inexpensive and safer than the use of gas or solid chlorine.|$|E
25|$|Fishing {{scenes are}} rarely {{represented}} in ancient Greek culture, {{a reflection of}} the low social status of fishing. However, Oppian of Corycus, a Greek author wrote a major treatise on sea fishing, the Halieulica or Halieutika, composed between 177 and 180. This is the earliest such work to have survived to the modern day. The consumption of fish varied in accordance with the wealth and location of the household. In the Greek islands and on the coast, fresh fish and seafood (squid, octopus, and shellfish) were common. They were eaten locally but more often transported inland. Sardines and anchovies were regular fare for the citizens of Athens. They were sometimes sold fresh, but more frequently salted. A stele of the late 3rd century BCE from the small Boeotian city of Akraiphia, on Lake Copais, provides us with a list of fish prices. The cheapest was skaren (probably parrotfish) whereas Atlantic bluefin tuna was three times as expensive. <b>Common</b> <b>salt</b> water fish were yellowfin tuna, red mullet, ray, swordfish or sturgeon, a delicacy which was eaten salted. Lake Copais itself was famous in all Greece for its eels, celebrated by the hero of The Acharnians. Other fresh water fish were pike-fish, carp and the less appreciated catfish.|$|E
