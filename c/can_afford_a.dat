25|$|Other {{images of}} despair and madness fill the scene: a lunatic cavorts {{in the street}} beating himself {{over the head with}} a pair of bellows while holding a baby impaled on a spike—the dead child's frantic mother rushes from the house {{screaming}} in horror; a barber has taken his own life in the dilapidated attic of his barber-shop, ruined because nobody <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> haircut or shave; on the steps, below the woman who has let her baby fall, a skeletal pamphlet-seller rests, perhaps dead of starvation, as the unsold moralising pamphlet on the evils of gin-drinking, The Downfall of Mrs Gin, slips from his basket. An ex-soldier, he has pawned most of his clothes to buy the gin in his basket, next to the pamphlet that denounces it. Next to him sits a black dog, a symbol of despair and depression. Outside the distiller a fight has broken out, and a crazed cripple raises his crutch to strike his blind compatriot.|$|E

In the episode, after being robbed by Snake Jailbird, the Simpsons visit a money-saving seminar, where they learn ways to limit their expenses. Soon, the family <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> cheap last-minute flight to another country, the only {{disadvantage}} being {{that they do not}} know where their plane tickets will bring them, which leads them to spend their vacation in Japan.|$|E

500|$|In 2013, the Sihanaka were {{estimated}} to number around 200,000. Families are hierarchical, with parents exercising authoritarian {{control over their}} children. [...] Sihanaka {{men and women have}} significant autonomy in deciding when to marry and whether to divorce. [...] Marriages are disallowed between siblings, cousins, and direct ascendents. To reinforce this forbidden physical intimacy, Sihanaka have historically used a formal term of address when speaking to these particular family members. Mothers are traditionally subject to several fady, such as not being allowed to look at dead infants, eat veal, or eat a particular type of banana once their child had learned to say the word for it. Parents were traditionally responsible for educating their own children, and while today those who <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> formal education will study at school, parents and the broader community remain collectively engaged in educating children into social and cultural norms and practices. Male children are circumcised by their families no later than the age of seven.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the sleeve}} buttons usually cannot be undone, the {{stitching}} {{is such that}} it appears they could. Functional cuff buttons may be found on high-end or bespoke suits; this feature is called a surgeon's cuff and [...] "working button holes" [...] (U.S.). Some wearers leave these buttons undone to reveal that they <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> bespoke suit, although it is proper to leave these buttons done up. Modern bespoke styles and high end off-the-rack suits equipped with surgeon's cuffs have the last two buttons stitched off-centre, so that the sleeve hangs more cleanly should the buttons ever be undone. [...] Certainty in fitting sleeve length must be achieved, as once working button holes are cut, the sleeve length essentially cannot be altered further.|$|E
2500|$|Back in the story, Peter is {{discovering}} his new spider powers: {{climbing on}} the ceiling, shooting webs, and using his new found agility and strength {{to give a}} beating back to the bullies ("Bouncing Off the Walls"). Unfortunately his new powers don't impress Mary Jane, who drives off with Flash in his new car. Peter believes that if he <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> car, he'll be able to earn MJ's love; he enters an amateur wrestling contest and defeats champion Bonesaw McGraw for the $1,000 prize. On his way home he sees Flash going into MJ's house; soon after someone steals his new car, but Peter refuses to stop him. Uncle Ben sees the thief and runs after him, only to be killed by the speeding motorist. Ashamed of his recent selfishness and powerless to save his uncle, he goes to his room to grieve; Arachne sees him and shares in his pain ("Rise Above"). She gives him a costume made with the colors she described: [...] "For every heart that bleeds, will color your world red and the sorrow in the night, will be the blue you cannot shed." [...] Peter copes with his uncle's death and wish to [...] "Rise Above" [...] by swinging through the city breaking up crimes as [...] "Spider-Man" [...] ("NY Debut"). Editor of the Daily Bugle J. Jonah Jameson thinks he's a menace and offers cash for whoever can manage to get pictures of him; Peter takes on the job as Spider-Man's personal photographer.|$|E
