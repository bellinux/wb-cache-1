25|$|When an acid {{catalyst}} is used, {{the initial}} {{step in the}} reaction mechanism involves acid-catalyzed tautomerization of the <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compound</b> to the enol.

The enol is nucleophilic at the α-carbon, allowing it to attack the protonated <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compound,</b> leading to the aldol after deprotonation.

40|$|The {{formation}} and disappearance of acrylamide in binary and ternary mixtures of asparagine (or acrylamide), <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compounds</b> and amino acid derivatives was studied {{in an attempt}} to understand the different reactions produced in mixtures of <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compounds</b> and amino acids. The <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compounds</b> assayed included glucose, 2, 4 -decadienal, mercaptopyruvic acid, phenylpyruvic acid, and phenylacetaldehyde. The assayed amino acids were cysteine, N-acetylcysteine, and phenylalanine, in addition to asparagine. All assayed <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compounds</b> were able to convert asparagine into acrylamide to various extents, and some of them were more reactive than glucose. In addition, they inhibited the Michael additions responsible for acrylamide disappearance. On the other hand, the addition of amino acids mostly resulted in decreases of acrylamide, although acrylamide also increased in some mixtures. Amino acids decreased acrylamide yield because of both their competence with asparagine for <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compounds</b> and their reaction with the produced acrylamide. However, carbonyl-amine reactions formed new <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compounds,</b> which increased acrylamide content. Therefore, asparagine degradation in the presence of amino acids {{is likely to be a}} balance between the decrease of degradation produced by the original <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compounds</b> and the increase of degradation due to the <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compounds</b> formed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

25|$|If the {{catalyst}} is a moderate base such as hydroxide ion or an alkoxide, the aldol reaction occurs via nucleophilic {{attack by the}} resonance-stabilized enolate on the carbonyl group of another molecule. The product is the alkoxide salt of the aldol product. The aldol itself is then formed, and it may then undergo dehydration to give the unsaturated <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compound.</b> The scheme shows a simple mechanism for the base-catalyzed aldol reaction of an aldehyde with itself.|$|E
25|$|For example, in {{a typical}} acyl {{substitution}} reaction, the starting <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compound</b> is coordinated to the catalyst through one, two or possibly more hydrogen bonds. During the attack of the nucleophile, negative charge builds on the oxygen until the tetrahedral intermediate is reached. Therefore, the formally negative oxygen engages in a much stronger hydrogen bond than the starting carbonyl oxygen because of its increased negative charge. Energetically, this {{has the effect of}} lowering the intermediate and the transition state, thus accelerating the reaction.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of the Evans' method, the chiral {{auxiliary}} appended is an oxazolidinone, and the resulting <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compound</b> is an imide. A number of oxazolidinones are now readily available in both enantiomeric forms. These may cost roughly $10–$20 US dollars per gram, rendering them relatively expensive. However, enantiopure oxazolidinones are derived in 2 synthetic steps from comparatively inexpensive amino acids, which means that large-scale syntheses can be made more economical by in-house preparation. This usually involves borohydride mediated reduction of the acid moiety, followed by condensation/cyclisation of the resulting amino alcohol with a simple carbonate ester such as diethylcarbonate.|$|E

25|$|Alkyl and alkenyl sulfones {{with good}} leaving {{groups in the}} β {{position}} undergo elimination under reductive conditions to afford alkenes or alkynes. The Julia olefination exploits this process for the synthesis of alkenes from alkyl sulfones and carbonyl compounds.

25|$|A typical modern aldol {{addition}} reaction, shown above, {{might involve}} the nucleophilic {{addition of a}} ketone enolate to an aldehyde. Once formed, the aldol product can sometimes lose a molecule of water to form an α,β-unsaturated <b>carbonyl</b> <b>compound.</b> This is called aldol condensation. A variety of nucleophiles may be employed in the aldol reaction, including the enols, enolates, and enol ethers of ketones, aldehydes, and many other carbonyl compounds. The electrophilic partner is usually an aldehyde or ketone (many variations, such as the Mannich reaction, exist). When the nucleophile and electrophile are different, the reaction is called a crossed aldol reaction; on the converse, when the nucleophile and electrophile are the same, the reaction is called an aldol dimerization.|$|E

One idea is to generate the enolate using a metal catalyst that is released after the aldol addition mechanism. The general problem is that the addition generates an alkoxide, which is much more basic than the starting materials.
