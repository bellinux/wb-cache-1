5|$|According to van der Waerden's {{obituary}} of Emmy Noether, she did {{not follow}} a lesson plan for her lectures, which frustrated some students. Instead, she used her lectures as a spontaneous discussion time with her students, to think through and clarify important <b>cutting-edge</b> problems in mathematics. Some of her most important results were developed in these lectures, and the lecture notes of her students {{formed the basis for}} several important textbooks, such as those of van der Waerden and Deuring.|$|E
5|$|Expansion of {{teaching}} and research activities continues. In 2004, the Faculty of Engineering completed work on the Bristol Laboratory for Advanced Dynamics Engineering (BLADE). This £18.5m project provides <b>cutting-edge</b> technology to further the study of dynamics and is the most advanced such facility in Europe. It was built as an extension to the Queen's Building and was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in March 2005.|$|E
5|$|Frankenstein, MD is {{presented}} as an educational webseries presented by medical students (and later doctors) Victoria Frankenstein and Iggy DeLacey from the fictional Engle State University. Each episode generally consists of Frankenstein experimenting with <b>cutting-edge</b> medical technologies or theories, often using DeLacey or her childhood friends Eli Lavenza and Rory Clerval as subjects. Dr. Abraham Waldman serves {{as an adviser to}} Frankenstein, usually acting as a foil and reminding her of the impracticality or perceived impossibility of her experiments and theories.|$|E
5|$|Further {{proposals}} {{based on}} the delta wing resulted in {{two versions of the}} design known as C104: the single engine C104/4 and twin-engined C104/2. The designs were otherwise similar, using a low-mounted delta-wing; the primary advantages of the C104/2 were a larger overall size which offered a much larger internal weapons bay, at the time a <b>cutting-edge</b> feature in a fighter, and gave it twin-engine reliability. The proposals were submitted to the RCAF in June 1952.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that the light pollution from Cleveland was beginning to make <b>cutting-edge</b> research impossible from the East Cleveland site. A new site was constructed 30 miles to the east in Geauga County, known today as the Nassau Station, and the Burrell Schmidt telescope was moved to this location. In order to compensate for the move, a 36-inch telescope was soon installed at the Taylor Road facility.|$|E
5|$|The {{software}} company CMC Limited {{had developed a}} Games and Event Management System (GEMS), which helped the organizers to efficiently manage events across the sports venues. It worked closely with Doordarshan, the official television broadcasters of the Games, to provide results of sporting competitions and live Games information. Additionally, <b>cutting-edge</b> technology like the implementation of geo-referenced maps and Geographic Information System (GIS) was implemented, so as to ensure a smooth and rapid flow of work.|$|E
5|$|Whitaker co-founded the International Institute for Peace (IIP) at Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey. Launched {{during the}} {{international}} Newark Peace Education Summit, IIP's {{mission is to}} develop programs and strategic partnerships to address <b>cutting-edge</b> issues such as increasing citizen security through community-building; {{the role of women}} and spiritual and religious leaders in peacebuilding; the impact of climate change; and the reduction of poverty. IIP operates under the auspices of UNESCO as a Category 2 Center.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1977 in {{downtown}} New York, punk rock was already ceding its <b>cutting-edge</b> status to the anarchic sound of Teenage Jesus and the Jerks and Mars, spearheads of {{what became known}} as no wave, although several original punk bands continued to perform and new ones emerged on the scene. The Cramps, whose core members were from Sacramento, California by way of Akron, had debuted at CBGB in November 1976, opening for the Dead Boys. They were soon playing regularly at Max's Kansas City. The Misfits formed in nearby New Jersey. Still developing what would become their signature B movie–inspired style, later dubbed horror punk, they made their first appearance at CBGB in April 1977.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{architecture}} {{is a combination}} between local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs. Sliding doors (fusuma) were used in place of walls, allowing the internal configuration of a space to be customized for different occasions. People usually sat on cushions or otherwise on the floor, traditionally; chairs and high tables were not widely used until the 20th century. Since the 19th century, however, Japan has incorporated much of Western, modern, and post-modern architecture into construction and design, and is today a leader in <b>cutting-edge</b> architectural design and technology.|$|E
5|$|Perkin-Elmer {{intended}} to use custom-built and extremely sophisticated computer-controlled polishing machines to grind the mirror to the required shape. However, in case their <b>cutting-edge</b> technology ran into difficulties, NASA demanded that PE sub-contract to Kodak to construct a back-up mirror using traditional mirror-polishing techniques. (The team of Kodak and Itek also bid on the original mirror polishing work. Their bid called for the two companies to double-check each other's work, which would have almost certainly caught the polishing error that later caused such problems.) The Kodak mirror is now on permanent display at the National Air and Space Museum. An Itek mirror built {{as part of the}} effort is now used in the 2.4m telescope at the Magdalena Ridge Observatory.|$|E
5|$|Die Another Day was novelised by the then-official James Bond writer, Raymond Benson, {{based on}} the {{screenplay}} by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. An effort is made to depict some of the film's more outlandish elements with more believability, {{in the style of}} Fleming's original novels' use of <b>cutting-edge</b> technology. So for example, the non-bodywork elements of the Aston Martin with its 'cloaking' function – the glass windows and rubber tyres – are described as having retractable covers to achieve the invisibility effect. Fan reaction to it was above average. After its publication Benson retired as the official James Bond novelist and a new series featuring the secret agent's adventures as a teenager, by Charlie Higson, was launched in 2005. As the novelisation was published after Benson's final original 007 novel, The Man with the Red Tattoo, it was the final literary work featuring Bond as originally conceived by Ian Fleming until the publication of Devil May Care by Sebastian Faulks in 2008 to mark the 100th anniversary of Fleming's birth.|$|E
5|$|Rage Software, {{developers}} of Incoming, were {{known for their}} <b>cutting-edge</b> graphics and effects. Incoming was no exception. The game utilized the 3dfx technology, and was included in some retail versions of the Voodoo2 graphics card. Critics were praising the game's visuals on its 1998 PC release. In particular, the explosions, similar special effects and cut scenes using the main game engine were noted for their quality. The Dolby Surround-encoded sound was a further source of acclaim. The reception, however, was less positive when the game was ported to the Dreamcast. A release title for Sega's console, critics complained that the graphics were not top-of-the-range {{at the time of}} its late 1999 release, with the draw distance being cited as a specific hindrance on gameplay. An arcade version followed in 2003, running on the Vortek V3 Global VR arcade board, utilising the system's unique virtual reality hardware interface.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} {{advances}} and new designs in gunpowder weapons during {{the beginning of}} the dynasty, but by the mid to late Ming the Chinese began to frequently employ European-style artillery and firearms. The Huolongjing, compiled by Jiao Yu and Liu Bowen sometime before the latter's death on 16 May 1375 (with a preface added by Jiao in 1412), featured many types of <b>cutting-edge</b> gunpowder weaponry for the time. This includes hollow, gunpowder-filled exploding cannonballs, land mines that used a complex trigger mechanism of falling weights, pins, and a steel wheellock to ignite the train of fuses, naval mines, fin-mounted winged rockets for aerodynamic control, multistage rockets propelled by booster rockets before igniting a swarm of smaller rockets issuing forth {{from the end of the}} missile (shaped like a dragon's head), and hand cannons that had up to ten barrels.|$|E
