50|$|The SAXBO {{stoneware}} {{generated a}} lot of attention at a Svenskt Tenn exhibition, the same year that Nylund was recruited to Rörstrand, at that time owned by Arabia. In order to start crafting stoneware the young ceramist was moved to the company’s factory in Lidköping, which was relatively unknown at that time and which focused solely on porcelain production. There he succeeded, thanks to his own specially developed technique, to produce the first Swedish matte glazed stoneware and sculptures in shimmering colorful stoneware <b>chamotte,</b> which was very popular and had an important impact on modern Swedish ce-ramics. Nylund’s stoneware at that time featured Sung-inspired crackelé and oxblood glazes - pieces that ranged from monumental original sculptures in stoneware <b>chamotte</b> and two-feet high urns to moderately priced miniature vases and bowls. In the mid-1930s, the <b>Chamotte</b> was produced both in series and original sculptures. After a one year break at Bing & Gröndahl in Denmark, Rörstrand’s new chief Fredrik Wehtje managed to get Nylund to return to Lidköping in 1937. Here he designed numerous tableware series and laid the ground for all the factory’s1940s collections, featuring innovative glazes.|$|E

The fact that the porogen must be completely eliminated during firing, leaving an int erconnected porous structure, impose large firing times, increasing the final price. A s tudy about the synthesis of porous <b>chamottes</b> {{as an alternative to}} organic pore formers was conducted to reduce firing costs. <b>Chamottes</b> were obtained from mixtures of a c lay and starch. Different starches were used and the influence of the composition and processing variables were studied. The viability of the porous <b>chamottes</b> was demonstra ted.

50|$|Bricks in the {{metallurgy}} {{and glass}} industries {{are often used}} for lining furnaces, in particular refractory bricks such as silica, magnesia, <b>chamotte</b> and neutral (chromomagnesite) refractory bricks. This type of brick must have good thermal shock resistance, refractoriness under load, high melting point, and satisfactory porosity. There is a large refractory brick industry, especially in the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States, Belgium and the Netherlands.|$|E
5000|$|Grog, {{also known}} as firesand and <b>chamotte,</b> is a ceramic raw material. It has high {{percentage}} of silica and alumina. It can be produced by firing selected fire clays to high temperature before grinding and screening to specific particle sizes. It can also be produced from pitchers. The particle size distribution is generally coarser in size than the other raw materials used to prepare clay bodies. It tends to be porous and have low density.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chamotte</b> {{is made by}} {{calcining}} {{fire clay}} (Al2O3-SiO2) above 1100 C. Its fusion point is 1750 C and has low thermal expansion. It is the second cheapest sand, however it is still twice as expensive as silica. Its disadvantages are very coarse grains, which result in a poor surface finish, and it is limited to dry sand molding. Mold washes are used to overcome the surface finish problem. This sand is usually used when casting large steel workpieces.|$|E
50|$|Lastly, {{the term}} hair-temperature pottery refers to ware made of fine, sorted clay {{tempered}} with about 30% finely cut hair and <b>chamotte</b> with similar shape, size, and surface treatment (including decoration) as the asbestos pottery. It does not generally contain asbestos, but some samples have small traces. Hair, when used as ceramic temper, leaves thin pores in the ware after firing. Its intended use is unknown, but its adiabatic capacity suggests {{some kind of}} insulating usage (but not heat resistance).|$|E
50|$|Laurušaitė creates figurative dishes, mainly {{bowls and}} pots {{in the shape}} of a woman.

Setting himself apart from the trends and fashions of the times, he developed his own artistic style, finding his inspiration in his personal mythology, and background, {{as well as in the}} discoveries he made when travelling. For his work as a ceramicist he used mostly grog (also called firesand or <b>chamotte).</b> He never used the wheel, but built up his pieces by hand, in the traditional way.|$|E
50|$|Later works - vases {{in shape}} of a woman - exhibit soft, free, {{sometimes}} asymmetric shapes. Details (body parts) are often not well-pronounced, leaving clear traces of molding process. White <b>chamotte</b> and stoneware are primary materials. The surfaces of the dishes are first glazed white and then lavishly decorated in bright colors and relief. Works from this period include Katinėlis ir angelas (Kitty and Angel, 1999), Moteris su ožiais (The Woman with the Goats, 2002), Vakarienės metas (Dinner Time, 2002), Mama su vaiku (Mother with Child, 2003), Su prijuoste (With the Apron, 2004), Su papais (With the Tits, 2005), Su ąsomis (With Jug's Handles, 2006).|$|E
5000|$|Humans {{have used}} fire for melting and heat {{treating}} metals {{for thousands of}} years. To ensure safe working with the fire, for melting and working metals (bronze, iron), special refractory materials were needed to enable the handling of liquid or hot metals [...] To {{meet the needs of}} the wide-ranging applications, a large number of shaped, dense materials (refractory bricks, <b>chamotte),</b> shaped heat-insulating materials (lightweight refractory bricks) and unshaped refractory materials (heavy- and lightweight ramming mixes) have been developed, which are used for special high temperature applications. For decades, however, other manmade materials have been used for thermal insulation, glass wool and rock wool being used in the low-temperature range (around 200 °C to maximum 500 °C).|$|E
50|$|Most of Nylund’s {{original}} sculptures in stoneware <b>chamotte</b> {{ended up}} in museums, as did much of his other work.

5000|$|Dagmar Hinz {{was born}} {{soon after the}} start of the Second World War in Sonneberg, a small town in the centre of {{southern}} Germany, located between Würzburg and Leipzig. Before she was 3 her father had been killed in the fighting. Her mother worked as a milliner. [...] By the time she had successfully completed her schooling the war had ended, in May 1945, and after the armies had finished repositioning themselves Sonneberg had ended up {{at the edge of the}} Soviet occupation zone in what remained of Germany. The entire zone was refounded as the German Democratic Republic in October 1949. During the later 1950s Hinz undertook an apprenticeship for work as a Ceramics and Pottery technician. She later recalled that she had really wanted to become an economist, but had been unable to obtain a study-place. [...] In 1960, with support from her boss at the ceramics factory, she was able to obtain a place at the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology where she studied Silicate Metallurgy, emerging with a degree in 1965. [...] She then obtained a university position as a research assistant and started working on a doctorate.During the 1960s she married the economist Frieder Hülsenberg. At this time Hülsenberg was writing a book, drafts for which his wife read. She alerted him to an important inconsistency in the text which he was obliged to discuss with his co-author, the Dresden Economics Professor Otto Gallenmüller. One upshot of the ensuing discussions was that Dagmar Hülsenberg hurriedly mastered relevant portions of the Economics syllabus and, in 1969, obtained a doctorate from Freiberg University in Economics for a dissertation entitled [...] "Determining an optimal number of cost centres and cost objects, with particular attention to error aggregation" [...] Just a year later, in 1970, she received a second doctorate, this time in Material Sciences: her dissertation on this occasion was entitled [...] "High-temperature deformation of heterogeneous materials, illustrated using fire-resistant <b>chamotte</b> (fire clay)" ...|$|E
5000|$|Apply {{investment}} materials: The ceramic mould, {{known as}} the investment, is produced by repeating a series of steps—coating, stuccoing, and hardening—until a desired thickness is achieved. Coating involves dipping a pattern cluster into a slurry of fine refractory material and then draining to create a uniform surface coating. Fine materials are used in this first step, also called a prime coat, to preserve fine details from the mould. Stuccoing applies coarse ceramic particles by dipping patterns into a fluidised bed, placing it in a rainfall-sander, or by applying materials by hand. Hardening allows coatings to cure. These steps are repeated until the investment reaches its required thickness—usually 5 to 15 mm. Investment moulds are left to dry completely, which can take 16 to 48 hours. Drying can be accelerated by applying a vacuum or minimizing environmental humidity. Investment moulds can also be created by placing the pattern clusters into a flask and then pouring liquid investment material from above. The flask is then vibrated to allow entrapped air to escape and help the investment material fill any small voids. [...] Common refractory materials used to create the investments are: silica, zircon, various aluminium silicates, and alumina. Silica is usually used in the fused silica form, but sometimes quartz is used because it is less expensive. Aluminium silicates are a mixture of alumina and silica, where commonly used mixtures have an alumina content from 42 to 72%; at 72% alumina the compound is known as mullite. During the primary coat(s), zircon-based refractories are commonly used, because zirconium {{is less likely to}} react with the molten metal. Prior to silica, a mixture of plaster and ground up old molds (<b>chamotte)</b> was used. The binders used to hold the refractory material in place include: ethyl silicate (alcohol-based and chemically set), colloidal silica (water-based, also known as silica sol, set by drying), sodium silicate, and a hybrid of these controlled for pH and viscosity.|$|E

40|$|Two {{different}} types of alumina-based refractories have been investigated. <b>Chamotte</b> and bauxite were the raw materials, being molded using a system of aluminate cement and water or a phenol-formaldehyde resin, as binder. Different raw material's grain size, water content, molding pressure, and firing temperature were selected for {{the preparation of the}} specimens. The mechanical strength of all specimens was determined using compressive tests, where parameters with physical meaning, such as maximum stress, maximum strain, elasticity parameter, and viscoelastic parameter were obtained after modeling the collected stress-strain data. In addition, water quenching test was performed for both samples, in order to present their thermal stability and mechanical wear after certain cycles. Process conditions as well as the raw materials' characteristics were correlated with the compressive properties. More specifically, maximum stress seemed to increase when increasing all parameters except grain size both for bauxite and <b>chamotte</b> samples. The increment of bonding phase, grain size, and molding pressure caused an increment in maximum strain for both types of refractories. However, the higher the firing temperature was the higher the maximum strain of bauxite appeared, while the maximum strain of <b>chamotte</b> samples was decreased. Modulus of elasticity seemed to increase with bonding phase content and firing temperature and decreased with grain size for both types of refractories. For bauxite samples higher molding pressure caused a decrement in elasticity parameter while for <b>chamotte</b> in caused an increment. As far as the quenching tests are concerned <b>chamotte</b> samples seemed to be more tolerant to thermal shock. After data acquisition, the change presented in elasticity parameter (E) was also modeled with the number of cycles. Both bauxite and <b>chamotte</b> samples showed a decrement in maximum stress after thermal treatment, while elasticity parameter seemed to have a more severe decrement for bauxite samples. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S. r. l.
