50|$|In the game, {{the chaos}} beast attacks its enemies with {{whatever}} weapons {{its current form}} has. Whether those be fangs, <b>claws,</b> horns, <b>pincers,</b> tentacles, spikes, magical attacks (like breath weapons), or whatever else. These are surprisingly ineffective, however, as the chaos beast can rarely attack more than twice before changing again, and never has time to coordinate attacks. The main weapon of the chaos beast is its touch which apparently transfers the chaos energy to the victim, turning him/her into an amorphous mass that, if unable to be healed, bubbles, boils, writhes, and shifts. The victim is unable to act coherently, has difficulty hitting a target, and eventually becomes a chaos beast forever. A chaos beast is immune to transformation, petrifaction, and transmutation spells, as it will just continue to shift shape anyway.|$|R
