40|$|Abstract Cropping is {{a cutting}} process whereby {{opposing}} aligned blades create a shearing failure by exerting opposing forces normal to {{the surfaces of}} a metal sheet or plate. Building on recent efforts to quantify cropping, this paper formulates a plane strain elastic-plastic model of a plate subject to shearing action by opposing rigid platens. Shear failure {{at the local level}} is modeled by a cohesive zone characterized by the peak shear traction and the energy dissipated by shear failure process at the microscopic level. The model reveals the interplay between shear cracking and the extensive plastic shearing accompanying the cutting process. Specifically, it provides insight into the influence of the material’s microscopic shear strength and toughness on the total work of cropping. The computational model does not account for deformation of the <b>cropping</b> <b>tool,</b> friction between sliding surfaces and material temperature and rate-dependence. Key words: Cropping, shear fracture, finite strain plasticity, cohesive zone, fracture energ...|$|E

The Dictionary of Words in the Wild is a simple online mechanism for uploading and viewing photographic images of words as they are found, wherever they are found and in whatever condition in the daily environment. Typically while out and about a contributor photographs words or phrases as these catch the eye, most often in passing, sometimes with necessary discretion, sometimes without knowing what exactly may have {{been caught in the}} moment. Later, uploading the catch of images, he or she tags each with the words or phrases shown in it. A <b>cropping</b> <b>tool</b> allows for a certain degree of framing in order best to represent what was fleetingly glimpsed. The Dictionary now contains about 3000 images and 4000 unique words ­­– enough to allow speculation on what research might be done with it or with a more deliberately crafted tool. But the Dictionary was not built with any particular theory of language in mind. Rather those responsible are interested in seeing what might come of it, what theories might apply and what demands might be made on the technology. In this talk I will describe the Dictionary, demonstrate it, relate my experiences as one of the major contributors and invite discussion of its significance...|$|E

40|$|Because of the {{variable}} and changing environment, advisors and farmers are seeking systems that provide risk management support {{at a number}} of time scales. The Agricultural Production Systems Research Unit, Toowoomba, Australia has developed a suite of tools to assist advisors and farmers to better manage risk in <b>cropping.</b> These <b>tools</b> range from simple rainfall analysis tools (Rainman, HowWet, HowOften) through <b>crop</b> simulation <b>tools</b> (WhopperCropper and YieldProphet) to the most complex, APSFarm, a whole-farm analysis tool. Most are derivatives of the APSIM <b>crop</b> model. These <b>tools</b> encompass a range of complexity and potential benefit to both the farming community and for government policy. This paper describes, the development and usage of two specific products; WhopperCropper and APSFarm. WhopperCropper facilitates simulation-aided discussion of growers' exposure to risk when comparing alternative crop input options. The user can readily generate 'what-if' scenarios that separate the major influences whilst holding other factors constant. Interactions of the major inputs can also be tested. A manager can examine the effects of input levels (and Southern Oscillation Index phase) to broadly determine input levels that match their attitude to risk. APSFarm has been used to demonstrate that management changes can have different effects in short and long time periods. It can be used to test local advisors and farmers' knowledge and experience of their desired rotation system. This study has shown that crop type has a larger influence than more conservative minimum soil water triggers in the long term. However, in short term dry periods, minimum soil water triggers and maximum area of the various crops can give significant financial gains...|$|R

40|$|A ‘Women’s Crop Tool’ was {{developed}} to measure women’s control over decision-making for crop production, sales, and use of income. We tested the tool for groundnuts in Eastern Province, Zambia, using a mixed methods approach that involved Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and a quantitative household survey. Women in FGDs {{reported higher levels of}} control than women in the household survey. We argue that the more extreme results from the FGDs are {{due to the nature of}} the research question over the ‘power to name’. FGDs provided a public space for a struggle over meaning that exposed latent conflicts over gender roles, gender identities, and the conjugal contract. Mechanization of groundnut shelling has increased male participation in this activity. We used Propensity Score Matching (PSM) to determine whether the introduction of shelling machines reduced women’s control over groundnuts, as measured by the weighted women’s gender control index (WGCI), constructed by aggregating the scores obtained from the Women’s <b>Crop</b> <b>Tool.</b> Results showed that the shelling machine significantly increased the women’s WGCI, while the area planted to groundnuts and the volume of groundnut sales had no significant effect on the women’s WGCI. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the commercialization of groundnuts has not reduced women’s control over groundnuts, while women perceived that the introduction of the machine sheller had increased their control over decision-making...|$|R
40|$|A {{formidable}} mythology {{has grown}} up around the Pilgrims and their voyage to the New World. In the popular myth a group of idealistic religious reformers fled persecution into the wilds of the New World, braving seas, storms, winter, hunger, and death {{at the hands of}} teeming hordes of Indians, carving a new life out of an unspoiled wilderness, building a civilization with naked force of will and an unshakable religious vision. As with most historical myths, this account has been idealized {{to the point that it}} obscures the facts of the Pilgrims’ voyage. When the handful of separatists stepped onto the shores of New England in 1620, they did not step into an untamed wilderness. They did not run into wild bands of ravenous savages bent on their destruction, nor did they ever have to contend with the full force of nature’s fury. In fact, they walked into an abandoned village, whose inhabitants had been gone barely long enough for weeds to grow over the tilled fields of corn. They discovered caches of <b>crops,</b> <b>tools,</b> and other supplies, as if they were waiting to be found and put into use by industrious hands.

In the first of these studies, a group of 33 customers were intercepted as they obtained their print orders from their photofinisher. While reviewing their prints, the participants were asked which of their pictures they would like to zoom and crop. The users were then asked to use a collapsible template with a 2 : 3 aspect ratio to draw zoom and crop lines on the selected prints. These data were analyzed to determine the proportion of prints the users want to crop and the amount of cropping that was applied. In a second study the film of a group of 14 customers was intercepted, these pictures were scanned to a KODAK PHOTO CD Disc and the users were asked to use a computer-based tool to place a fixed 2 : 3 aspect ratio crop box in a subset of their photographs. This data was analyzed to determine the amount of cropping that was applied, as well as some guidelines for computer-based <b>crop</b> <b>tools.</b> This research shows that consumers wish to apply cropping to roughly 40 percent of their photographs.

Once the tool has been selected, dragging the tool across the desired area will select it. The selected area will be outlined by dotted lines, referred to as [...] "marching ants". These dotted lines are called [...] "marching ants", because the dashes look like ants marching around the selected area. To set a specific size or ratio, the tool option bar provides these settings.
