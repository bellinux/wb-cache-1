The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the influence of detoxification agents (<b>Calcium</b> <b>Folinate,</b> silymarin and ursodeoxycholic acid) on the side effects of methotrexate, applied in this protocol. Methods A modified acute toxicity form (GPOH) was used for side effects monitoring. The research included children with either standard or intermediate risk ALL in the consolidation therapy phase, who were hospitalised at the Institute for Child and Youth Health Care of Vojvodina in Novi Sad during the period from July 2010 to February 2011. Results The most frequent side effect after 40 applications of methotrexate in ten children was bone marrow depression. Methotrexate caused: leukopenia in 10 patients, thrombocytopenia in 5 patients; after the use of folic acid, platelet count grew in 8 patients, leukocyte in 2 patients. Less frequent side effects: an increase serum transaminase activity, the state of fever, bronchopneumonia, diarrhoea with mild cramps and hypercalcaemia. Conclusion The application of <b>Calcium</b> <b>Folinate,</b> silymarin and ursodeoxycholic acid prevented the occurrence of severe adverse effects caused by medium-high doses of methotrexate.

40|$|Abstract Background Following {{resection}} {{of liver}} metastases from colorectal cancer, 5 -year survivals are reportedly 30 – 39 %. It {{can be assumed}} that this clinical situation represents systemic disease. Therefore, it is postulated that systemic chemotherapy would improve outcomes, particularly in those whose disease is sensitive to the agents administered. One potential advantage of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is that it provides in vivo chemosensitivity data. Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy could therefore guide adjuvant chemotherapy following resection of liver metastases from colorectal cancer. Methods and design This is a prospective Phase II evaluation of outcomes in patients with potentially resectable liver metastases. Patients will receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy and will undergo resection. Postoperative chemotherapy will be directed by the degree of response to preoperative chemotherapy. All patients with Stage IV colorectal adenocarcinoma isolated to the liver that have disease that is amenable to complete ablation by resection, radiofrequency ablation, and/or cryoablation will be candidates for the trial. Patients will receive CPT- 11 180 mg/m 2 IV (over 90 minutes) on day 1 with 5 -FU 400 mg/m 2 bolus and 600 mg/m 2 by 22 hour infusion and <b>calcium</b> <b>folinate</b> 200 mg/m 2 on days 1 and 2, every 2 weeks. Altogether, six cycles of chemotherapy will be administered. Patients will then undergo resection and/or radiofrequency ablation. Patients who had stable disease or a clinical response with preoperative chemotherapy will receive an additional 12 cycles of CPT- 11 180 mg/m 2 IV (over 90 minutes) on day 1 with 5 -FU 400 mg/m 2 bolus and 600 mg/m 2 by 22 hour infusion and <b>calcium</b> <b>folinate</b> 200 mg/m 2 on days 1 and 2 (given every 2 weeks). Patients with resectable disease who had progressive disease during neoadjuvant chemotherapy will receive best supportive care or an alternative agent, {{at the discretion of}} the treating physician. Those patients who are not rendered free of disease following the neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery will receive best supportive care or an alternative agent, at the discretion of the treating physician. The primary endpoint of the study is disease-free survival. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, safety and feasibility, response to chemotherapy, and quality of life. </p...|$|E

Purpose: The {{purpose of the study}} was the research of different regimens of inductive therapy for middle and low rectal cancer. The rate of the tumor pathological complete response (pCR) and long-term results of the treatment were evaluated. Methods: 253 patients were included in the research. They were divided into four groups depending on the kind of preoperative treatment: the first group – radiotherapy (RT) with total focal dose of radiation 38 – 44 Gy, n = 71, the second group – RT 45 – 50 Gy, n = 34, the third group – chemoradiotherapy (CRT) 38 – 44 Gy, n = 49, the fourth group – CRT 45 – 50 Gy, n = 99. The RT was administered in daily fractions of 1. 8 to 2. 0 Gy, five days per week. Five-fluorouracil alone or combined with <b>calcium</b> <b>folinate,</b> capecitabine, tegafur, oxaliplatin combined with capecitabine or 5 -fluorouracil and <b>calcium</b> <b>folinate</b> were used as a radiation sensitizer. The long term results were evaluated depending on pCR. There were 18 patients with pCR and median follow up of 31 months, 181 patients with no pCR and follow up of 30 months. Results. The pCR was registered in: the first group – in five (7 %) cases, the second group – in three (9 %) cases, the third group – in one (2 %) case, the fourth group – in 15 (15 %) cases. The overall rate of pCR was 9. 4 %. The rate of local relapses among patients with pCR was 5. 5 %, without pCR – 7. 7 % (р = 0. 89). The rate of relapse free survival was 83 and 74. 5 % respectively (р = 0. 417). The rate of disease free survival was 94 и 83. 9 % respectively (р = 0. 228). Conclusion.

40|$|Mucositis is a {{debilitating}} side-effect of chemotherapy which affects the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the small intestine. Currently {{there are no}} simple, non-invasive methods to detect and monitor small intestinal function and the severity of mucosal damage. Activity of the brush-border enzyme sucrase provides an indicator of small intestinal absorptive function that remains relatively constant throughout life. Measuring 13 CO- 2 levels in expired breath following ingestion of 13 C-sucrose is a non-invasive marker of total intestinal sucrase activity. We evaluated the sucrose breath test (SBT) {{as an indicator of}} small intestinal injury and dysfunction, utilizing a rat model of chemotherapy-induced mucositis. SBT results reflected the time-course of damage and repair after methotrexate (MTX) treatment, with damage most severe 72 h after chemotherapy, and repair commencing after 96 h. SBT results correlated significantly with jejunal sucrase activity determined biochemically (r 2 = 0. 89; p< 0. 005). Moreover, <b>calcium</b> <b>folinate</b> ingested prior to chemotherapy totally prevented damage to the small intestinal mucosa induced by MTX, as assessed by the SBT in concert with structural, and biochemical indices. The SBT provides a simple, non-invasive, integrated measure of small intestinal damage and function.

This technique possesses further applicability to the screening of newly-developed agents for potential gastrointestinal toxicity including the development of new therapies targeted at minimising or preventing the onset of chemotherapy-induced mucositis.

METHODS: The clinical pathological data of 64 patients with PCCCL treated with hepatectomy in our hospital from January 2000 to January 2006 were analyzed retrospectively. The patients {{were divided into two}} groups to make treatment analysis: curative resection only (n = 40); and curative resection and postoperative chemotherapy with <b>calcium</b> <b>folinate</b> and tegafur (n = 24). Meanwhile, the PCCCL patients were subdivided into two subgroups {{on the basis of the}} proportion of clear cells in the tumor for pathological analysis. There were 36 cases in subgroup A for which the proportion of clear cells was more than 70 %, and 28 cases in subgroup B for which the proportion was less or equal to 70 %, comparing analysis of median survival time of the counterpart groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to examine factors that affected clinical prognosis, recurrence and metastasis. RESULTS: Median survival period of the curative surgery group was 38 mo, while the counterpart was 41 mo. Median survival period for group A was 41 mo, while group B was 19 mo. The Kaplan-Meier method showed that capsule formation, preoperative liver function, hepatitis C virus infection, large vascular invasion and multiple tumor occurrences were related to disease-free survival. Cox regression analysis showed that the clear cell ratio, capsule formation, preoperative liver function and large vascular invasion were independent risk factors for overall survival.

A 70 -year-old man had a reconstruction of the pelvic floor with a biological mesh because of a perineal hernia after laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection. Nine months after the perineal hernia operation, the patient had multiple metastases in both lungs and liver. The patient underwent chemotherapy, including bevacizumab, irinotecan, <b>calcium</b> <b>folinate,</b> and fluorouracil. Six weeks into chemotherapy, the patient developed signs of sepsis and complained of pain from the right buttock. Ultrasound examination revealed an abscess, which was drained, guided by ultrasound. A computed tomography scan showed a subcutaneous abscess cavity located in the right buttock with communication to the small bowel. Operative findings confirmed a perineal fistula from the distal ileum to perineum. A resection of the small bowel with primary anastomosis was performed. The postoperative course was complicated by fluid and electrolyte disturbances, but the patient was stabilized and finally discharged to a hospice for terminal care after 28 days of hospital stay. It seems that hernia repairs with biological meshes have lower erosion and infection rates compared with synthetic meshes, and so far, evidence suggests that biological grafts are safe and effective {{in the treatment of}} pelvic floor reconstruction. There have been no reports of enteric fistulas after pelvic reconstruction with biological meshes. However, the development of intestinal fistulas after chemotherapy with bevacizumab has been described in the literature. Our case report supports this association between bevacizumab and fistula formation among rectal cancer patients, as symptoms of a fistula started only 6 weeks into bevacizumab treatment but approximately 12 months after the perineal hernia operation, even after pelvic reconstruction using a biological mesh and without local recurrence.

In the 62  patients with malignant tumors, the body mass index (BMI) was less than 18 (underweight) in six of them, with two cases of acute pancreatitis (33. 33 %); the BMI was 18 – 25 (normal weight) in 34 cases, with one case (2. 94 %) of acute pancreatitis; the BMI was 25 – 30 (overweight) in 13  cases, with 0 cases (0. 00 %) of acute pancreatitis; and the BMI was ≥ 30 (obese) in nine patients, with two cases of acute pancreatitis (22. 22 %). After symptomatic treatment, four patients were cured and one died; the mortality rate was 1. 61 %. Most of them appeared in the first 4 days after chemotherapy; the probability of this complication is significantly higher in slim and obese patients than in normal weight patients. Postoperative colorectal cancer patients after FOLFOX 6 chemotherapy have a sudden onset of acute pancreatitis occult, especially in patients with severe acute pancreatitis; the symptoms are difficult to control, there is high mortality and it is worthy of clinician’s attention.
