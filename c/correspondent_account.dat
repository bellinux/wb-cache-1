U.S. financial institutions must also take steps to prevent the indirect servicing of a foreign shell bank by allowing a <b>correspondent</b> <b>account</b> to be established and maintained by another foreign bank who acts on behalf of that foreign shell bank. However, exceptions are made if the shell bank is an affiliate (under the control) of a bank that has a physical presence in the U.S. or if the foreign shell bank is subject to supervision by a banking authority in the non-U.S. country regulating the affiliated depository institution, credit union, or foreign bank.|$|E

The money from the buyer's account goes to an internal account of your bank. The money to the customer or supplier comes from an account the buyer's local bank holds with a bank in the supplier's country—the buyer's bank's <b>correspondent</b> <b>account,</b> at their correspondent bank.|$|E

5000|$|Enhanced due {{diligence}} (EDD) {{is a more}} detailed standard required for larger customers and transactions.

[...] US regulations require that EDD measures are applied to account types such as Private banking, <b>Correspondent</b> <b>account,</b> and Offshore banking institutions.

An article published by Peter Warrack in the July 2006 edition of ACAMS Today (Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists) suggests the following: [...] "A rigorous and robust process of investigation over and above (KYC) procedures, that seeks with reasonable assurance to verify and validate the customer’s identity; understand and test the customer’s profile, business and account activity; identify relevant adverse information and risk; assess the potential for money laundering and / or terrorist financing to support actionable decisions to mitigate against financial, regulatory and reputational risk and ensure regulatory compliance." ...|$|E

The subtitle has several sections that prohibit or restrict the use of certain accounts held at financial institutions.

Under section 319 any deposits into foreign banks are also considered to have been deposited into any interbank account the foreign bank may have in the U.S. Thus any restraining order, seizure warrant or arrest warrant may be made against the funds in the interbank account held at a U.S. financial institution, up to the amount deposited in the account at the foreign bank.|$|E

Financial institutions are prohibited from allowing clients to specifically direct them to move funds into, out of, or through a concentration account, and they are also prohibited from informing their clients about the existence of such accounts. Financial institutions are not allowed to provide any information to clients that may identify such internal accounts.Financial institutions are required to document and follow methods of identifying where the funds are for each customer in a concentration account that co-mingles funds belonging to one or more customers.|$|E
