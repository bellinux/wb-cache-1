50|$|With {{the fall}} of Rome the use of <b>cadastral</b> <b>maps</b> {{effectively}} discontinued. Medieval practice used written descriptions {{of the extent of}} land rather than using more precise surveys. Only in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries did the use of <b>cadastral</b> <b>maps</b> resume, beginning in the Netherlands. With the emergence of capitalism in Renaissance Europe the need for <b>cadastral</b> <b>maps</b> reemerged as a tool to determine and express control of land as a means of production. This took place first privately in land disputes and later spread to governmental practice as a means of more precise tax assessment.|$|E

40|$|The <b>cadastral</b> <b>map</b> {{represents}} an essential layer of any spatial data infrastructure, as well emphasized by the European directive INSPIRE. In this context, each cadastral parcel assumes a fundamental role, since it constitutes {{one of the}} key elements for carrying out an interoperable information system. The parcel represents the link among the legal domain information, the public restrictions, the private taxes, and further layers. The <b>cadastral</b> <b>map,</b> therefore, enlarges the required interoperable links to the complete available geo information tools like networks, plans, services and others. To fulfil this function, the <b>cadastral</b> <b>map</b> must satisfy a high level of accuracy, not reachable {{at the time of its}} implementation, often more than one century ago. Furthermore, the harmonization of a digital <b>cadastral</b> <b>map</b> into a spatial information system is complicated by further problems like fragmented reference systems, inaccurate upgrades, distorted and discontinuous representations. Accordingly, the <b>cadastral</b> <b>map</b> updating requires appropriate interventions. Sometimes the corrective actions prove to be empirical, not reproducible and of costly maintenance. Furthermore, the diversity of solutions hinders the database harmonization of the various administrations. This paper analyses the problems inherent in the Italian <b>cadastral</b> <b>map,</b> describes the methodology developed to update the digital map and recover the original geometric accuracy. Furthermore, the paper shows the results of a global and qualified set of interventions carried out by the Friuli Venezia Giulia regional administration, in cooperation with INSIEL Spa and the University of Udine, that make the cadastral data base fully harmonized and interoperable within the regional spatial data infrastructure...|$|R

In the urban area the original analog <b>cadastral</b> <b>map</b> in scale 1 : 2000 is still valid. This map was created based on results of technical-economical mapping in 1969.
