5|$|In taking office, Morales {{emphasized}} nationalism, anti-imperialism, and anti-neoliberalism, although did {{not initially}} refer to his administration as socialist. In what was widely termed a populist act, he immediately reduced both his own presidential wage {{and that of}} his ministers by 57% to $1,875 a month, also urging members of <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same. Morales gathered together a largely inexperienced cabinet made up of indigenous activists and leftist intellectuals, although over {{the first three years of}} government there was a rapid turnover in the cabinet as Morales replaced many of the indigenous members with trained middle-class leftist politicians. By 2012 only 3 of the 20 cabinet members identified as indigenous.|$|E

6000|$|I don't stop at this illustration. I {{come to the}} State of Indiana; {{and what}} I have said as between Kentucky and Ohio, I repeat as between Indiana and Kentucky: it is equally applicable.

And so we have the evidence that Indiana supposed she could have slaves, {{if it were not for}} that Ordinance; that she besought <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> put that barrier out of the way; that <b>Congress</b> refused <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so; and it all ended at last in Indiana being a free State.

2500|$|By 1938, as Justice Brandeis acknowledged, [...] "the mischievous {{results of}} the {{doctrine}} had become apparent." [...] The problem with Swift was that rather than reducing forum shopping, it had only increased it by increasing the opportunities for forum shopping available to litigants. [...] There were two underlying issues behind this. [...] First, as the Erie opinion noted, nothing in the Constitution actually grants jurisdiction to the federal judiciary to conduct plenary review of issues of state common law where no federal issue is present. [...] Second, in accordance with that understanding (although this latter point was not noted in the Erie opinion), Section 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 only authorized the Supreme Court to review those state supreme court decisions that rejected federal claims. [...] While Congress broadened the scope of Supreme Court review in 1914 to include state supreme court decisions allowing federal claims, Congress never actually authorized the Supreme Court to conduct plenary review of the merits of state law claims (and no one ever sought a constitutional amendment that would authorize <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that). [...] This meant the Supreme Court could not directly dictate uniform rules of state common law to all state courts or reverse their decisions for failing to apply such rules, which stands {{in stark contrast to}} other common law federations like Australia and Canada whose highest courts do possess such powers. [...] Since state courts had no actual obligation to follow the [...] "general law" [...] independently formulated under Swift by federal courts, state judge-made law continued to diverge instead of converge.|$|E

30|$|By {{more clearly}} {{defining}} {{what it meant}} to be disabled under the ADA, and by explicitly overturning four previous judicial interpretations that had severely restricted {{what it meant to}} be disabled under the ADA, Congress had dual purposes in passing the 2008 Amendments to the ADA.

According to EEOC Legal Counsel Peggy Mastroianni, the agency’s ultimate aspiration for the ADAAA has been to create a system in which “‘employers are expeditiously determining whether individuals have disabilities and then moving on to the heart of the matter: judging fitness based on individual abilities and qualifications, and providing accommodation where needed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the job.’ Over time, that should result in a reduction in ADA litigation” (Dorrian 2014).|$|R
