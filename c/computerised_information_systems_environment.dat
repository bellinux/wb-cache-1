To design a <b>computerised</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> to suite an organisation can be a challenge, with all the layers and dimensions an organisation can have. This thesis has tried to study small organisations and find factors that could help the designer of a <b>computerised</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> for a small organisation. The factors are from the organisational culture {{and structure of the}} organisation. To find these factors the Organisational theory is used. The thesis is a qualitative case study research that tries to interpret and understand the organisation studied. The empirical data is gathered from documents, web sites and interviews. The analysis of the empirical data is done with the help of Organisational theory and the components of a <b>computerised</b> <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> The result of this research is a list of ten factors that a designer should consider when designing a <b>computerised</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> for a small organisation. These factors are: 1. Support remote work 2. The legislation 3. Support the possible growth of the organisation 4. Support new actors 5. Access via the Internet 6. Able to introduce the customers into the system 7. Able to handle many simultaneous projects 8. Support the organisational structure of the organisation (like centralised structure) 9.

40|$|Threats to <b>computerised</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> {{are always}} on the rise and compel organisations to invest {{a lot of money}} and time amongst other {{technical}} controls in an attempt to protect their critical information from inherent security risks. The computerisation of <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> in secondary schools has effectively exposed these organisations to a host of complex information security challenges that they have to deal with in addition to their core business of teaching and learning. Secondary schools handle large volumes of sensitive information pertaining to educators, learners, creditors and financial records that they are obliged to secure. <b>Computerised</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> are vulnerable to both internal and external threats but ease of access sometimes manifest in security breaches, thereby undermining information security. Unfortunately, school managers and users of <b>computerised</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> are ignorant of the risks to their <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> assets and the consequences of the compromises that might occur thereof. One way of educating school managers and users about the risks to their <b>computerised</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> is through a risk management programme in which they actively participate. However, secondary schools do not have the full capacity to perform information security risk management exercises due to the unavailability of risk management experts and scarce financial resources to fund such programmes. This qualitative case study was conducted in two secondary schools that use <b>computerised</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> to support everyday administrative operations. The main objective of this research study was to assist secondary schools that used <b>computerised</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> to develop a set of guidelines they would use to effectively manage information security risks in their <b>computerised</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> This study educated school managers and <b>computerised</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> users on how to conduct simple risk management exercises. The Operationally Critical Threats, Assets and Vulnerability Evaluation for small-scale organisations risk management method was used to evaluate the <b>computerised</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> in the two schools and attain the goals of the research study. Data for this study were generated through participatory observation, physical inspections and interview techniques. Data were presented, analysed and interpreted qualitatively. This study found that learners‟ continuous assessment marks, financial information, educators‟ personal information, custom application software, server-computers and telecommunication equipment used for networking were the critical assets. The main threats to these critical assets were authorised and unauthorised systems users, malware, system crashes, access paths and incompatibilities in software. The risks posed by these threats were normally led to the unavailability of critical <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> assets, compromise of data integrity and confidentiality. This also led to the loss of productivity and finance, and damage to school reputation. The only form of protection mechanism enforced by secondary schools was physical security. To mitigate the pending risks, the study educated school managers and users in selecting, devising and implementing simple protection and mitigation strategies commensurate with their <b>information</b> <b>systems,</b> financial capabilities and their level of skills. This study also recommended that secondary schools remove all critical computers from open-flow school networks, encrypt all critical information, password-protect all computers holding critical information and train all users of <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> of personal security. The study will be instrumental in educating school managers and <b>computerised</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> users in <b>information</b> security awareness and risk management in general.

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of handheld {{technologies such as}} smartphones and personal digital assistants {{in recent years has}} created opportunities for the mobile workforce to take advantage of <b>computerised</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> To apprehend and harness the opportunities of <b>computerised</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> implemented on handheld devices it is crucial to fully understand the user group and the handheld technology. However, {{there is a lack of}} comprehensive frameworks and toolkits supporting designers of <b>computerised</b> handheld <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> for the mobile workforce. The aim of this dissertation is to address this issue by developing both a framework and a toolkit for use early in the design process. To develop and evaluate the framework and the toolkit, various qualitative methods such as interviews, artefact studies, and experiments were applied for assessing both users’ and designers’ views on handheld computing. The analysis is made from a designers’ perspective and based on the entities, user, application, context and technologies. The proposed accentuated factors framework is a comprehensive framework of fifteen factors, evaluated and approved by experienced practitioners. The HISD Toolkit presented is based on the accentuated factors framework and supported by the design propositions Least Common Denominator, Flexible Forms, Tune-In and Defensive Design, which are also presented in this dissertation. The main implication for research is the use of the accentuated factors framework in analysis of handheld computing. The main implications in practice are the use of the HISD Toolkit in the design of handheld <b>information</b> <b>systems,</b> in the teaching of handheld computing, and in the evaluation of existing systems as in the procurement of <b>computerised</b> handheld <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> The study has been supported by the Swedish Research School of Management and Information Technology (MIT...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — When {{developing}} <b>computerised</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> it {{is common}} to begin with some kind of business modelling to get an understanding of the planned <b>systems</b> <b>environment.</b> Different usability factors are also common to consider when the user interface is being designed. What is not so common is to take advantage of each of these activities when the other one is performed. By applying a language action perspective on the design of business processes and <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> this paper shows how to integrate elicitation, analysis and validation of business requirements and usability requirements.

40|$|Organisational {{information}} sharing {{has become more}} and more important as the amount of information grows. In order to accomplish the most effective and efficient sharing of information, analysis of the information needs and the organisation needs are vital. This dissertation focuses on the information needs sourced through the critical data sets of law enforcement organisations; specifically the Norwegian criminal intelligence and law enforcement community represented by the National Criminal Investigation Service (Kriminalpolitisentralen (Kripos)). Information sharing is particularly important in these communities due to consequences for alleged perpetrators, victims and witnesses. The theoretical framework starts with a brief investigation into the classical, mechanistic, and the systems worldviews before investigating different aspects of organisations; public administration; criminal justice organisations; an organisation’s internal structure and environment; and organisational culture. Today most <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> consist of both humans and computers, hence; an investigation into the concepts of data, information, knowledge, and <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> has been performed; review of different definitions; review of what a <b>computerised</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> is as opposed to knowledge systems or expert systems; examination of <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> in an organisational context; and investigation of <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> development particularly requirements gathering and analysis. The last subject in the theoretical investigation relates to investigation and analysis of criminal actions; define and distinguish the terms investigation and intelligence; examine how the concepts of data, information, and knowledge are used in criminal investigation; define and distinguish the different forms of law enforcement analysis; and last investigate eyewitness testimonies which, despite the many advances in forensic science, of many still considered the most important information source in criminal investigation. The empirical investigation at Kripos was performed using several different research methods aimed at qualitative aspects of the data followed by qualitative analysis. The theoretical views adopted in the research and the different data gathering methods allowed the researcher to explore {{information sharing}} throughout the organisation from both written and oral sources, and by doing so being able to; (1) identify possible communication break down points and specify an ideal communication pattern between different tribes (consisting of experts in the different fields needed in a criminal investigation); (2) develop an extended intelligence process which was mirrored in (3) the specification of the borders for the <b>computerised</b> <b>information</b> <b>system,</b> and (4) the developed conceptual data model for a <b>computerised</b> <b>information</b> system; (5) specify a log function for the <b>computerised</b> <b>information</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

The focus {{of the study is}} the problem of the lack of use of <b>computerised</b> personnel <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> by personnel specialists to develop the human resource management function. The literature of strategic management, human resource management and the fit between them are reviewed together with the history and the development of personnel systems in the UK. Senior personnel practitioners and their organisations in the three sectors were evaluated with respect to the stage of development of organisational planning and the contribution made by personnel practitioners using questionnaires, and in-depth interviews. The backgrounds and management styles of the practitioners were examined in order to evaluate their perceptions of: human resource management, computer systems and organisational planning. The degree to which practitioners made use of their <b>computerised</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> for administrative and strategic purposes and the problems they perceived were evaluated in order to judge their degree of evolution from 'traditional personnel practice' to 'human resource management'. The research findings indicated that, although there were are number of significant differences between the three sectors studied, these had little effect when considering the broad issues embedded in the six hypotheses. The evaluation of these hypotheses indicated that the practitioners were making substantial use of their systems for administrative but not for strategic purposes.
