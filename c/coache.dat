40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore how tenure {{procedures}} at institutions of higher education, workload, confidence in support of teaching and research objectives, climate, culture, collegiality and salary affect job satisfaction of tenure track faculty. The study compares three different cohort groups composed of tenure-track faculty from over eighty institutions of higher education in the United States. The cohort groups used in this study are Baccalaureate, Masters and Research institutions that have been classified by Carnegie Classification. Institutions of higher education were invited to participate in the Harvard University Collaborative on Academic Careers in Higher Education (<b>COACHE)</b> survey. Institutions that participated provided lists of their full-time tenure track faculty members who were pre-tenure. The University of North Carolina system (consisting of sixteen institutions) mandates that its institutions participate in this study. Previous research indicated both individual and institutional characteristics contribute to faculty job satisfaction. This study explored the differences in tenure track faculty job satisfaction by Carnegie Classification using exploratory factor analysis with oblimin rotation to construct factors which represent the dimensions of workload, confidence and support of teaching and research objectives by the institution's administration, autonomy,   climate, collegiality and salary. Because of institutional differences, these factors are experienced differently by the three cohort groups and therefore are indicative to each group. In order to observe the strength of each component and the amount of variation explained by the combination of these factors a stepwise linear multiple regression was conducted for each Carnegie Classification. Stepwise linear regression allowed estimation of the strength of the institutional components which contribute to tenure track faculty job satisfaction or dissatisfaction by observing differences in standardized beta weights and allowed observation of the amount of variation explained by each regression equation for each institution.   This study has observed differences in the constructs that make up tenure track faculty job satisfaction across different types of institutions defined by Carnegie Classification. This study enhances the institutional component of Johnsrud and Rosser's research because it used data that was collected more recently and focuses only on tenure track faculty. Additionally, it adds to the literature currently published by <b>COACHE,</b> which has been primarily descriptive in nature, by predicting what sets of variables contribute more predominantly to tenure track job satisfaction. The study observed differences in both the way that Johnsrud, Johnsrud, and Heck, Rosser and <b>COACHE</b> portray tenure track faculty job satisfaction.

Second, we examine team performance for several years following the replacement to assess its effects. Results. We find that for particularly poorly performing teams, coach replacements have little effect on team performance as measured against comparable teams that did not replace their coach.

40|$|College and {{university}} administrators frequently survey their faculty to inform decisions affecting the academic workplace. Higher education researchers, too, {{rely heavily on}} survey methodologies in their scholarly work. Survey response rates, however, have been declining steadily for decades, and when nonrespondents and respondents systematically differ on variables relevant to the instrument, the resulting nonresponse bias may lead those interpreting the data to erroneous conclusions.

The study began with a descriptive analysis of the demographic, professional, and institutional characteristics of faculty nonresponse utilizing data from the <b>COACHE</b> Faculty Job Satisfaction Survey administered at 69 four-year postsecondary institutions in the United States. Regression analysis identified the institutional variables that predict organization-level response rates on a faculty survey.

Additionally, the KSNand KD questionnaires were evaluated for their reliability and validity.

As online education grows exponentially each year (Allen 2 ̆ 6 Seaman, 2006), this aspect of professorial teaching is emerging as an increasingly critical factor. Many professors that teach in the online sector have taught or are currently teaching in a face-to-face setting as well (Preziosi 2 ̆ 6 Gooden, 2003).

A large body of research focuses on male sex offenders but it is problematic to generalize the results of these studies to women sex offenders (Vandiver & Walker, 2002; Wijkman, Bijleveld, & Hendricks, 2010). The gap in research on female sex offenders gives the impression to society that female sex offenders do not exist. There is very little empirical research that provides the exact number of female sex offenders in the United States (O’Connor, 1987; Finkelhor, Hotaling & Smith, 1990; Lewis & Stanley, 2000; Vandiver & Walker, 2002). Official reports and independent studies vary in the number of female sex offenders reported. Some studies report that females are involved in 1 % of all sexual offenses whereas international statistics report that females make up 5 % of the sex offending population (Vandiver & Walker, 2002; Cortoni, Hanson & <b>Coache,</b> M., 2010). Other empirical studies report that females make up 60 % of all sex offenders (Vandiver & Walker, 2002).

The articulation {{of work and}} life, cast as work life balance, has become a key feature of much current government, practitioner and academic debate (Eikhof, Warhurst, 2 ̆ 6 Haunschild, 2007). It is believed that balancing a successful career with a personal or family life can be challenging and impact on a person 2 ̆ 7 s satisfaction in their work and personal life 2 ̆ 7 s roles (Broers, 2005). This research sought to determine if: (a) work life differs by academic discipline group: (b) job satisfaction differs by academic discipline, and (c) {{there is a relationship}} between faculty work life and job satisfaction and whether this relationship differs by academic discipline group, and (d) if academic discipline has a unique effect on faculty work and life balance. In addition to exploring academic discipline, job satisfaction, and work life balance, this study used gender, age, salary, race, rank and professional experiences as control variables. The study employed exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), t-test and multiple regressions. Participants for this study included 143 tenure-track faculty members. Results indicated that the work life balance and job satisfaction has no significant among academic disciplines at ISU. However, the results indicated that there is a significant relationship (r =. 595) between work life and job satisfaction. When controlling for demographic and professional experience, the result also indicated that age and climate, and culture were significant predicators for work life balance. The results also showed that female faculty have lower job satisfaction. Age and climate, culture, and collegiality were also found to be predicators for job satisfaction.

40|$|Gender {{and faculty}} career {{advancement}} {{have been examined}} {{with a focus on}} academic work environment, including faculty workloads, mentoring relationships, access to research networks, and work-life balance. Previous studies concerned with gender, employment, and care work only have considered child care. Additionally, the exploration of faculty and care work focused specifically on gender instead of examining the interaction of race and gender. To date, no study on academic work-life policies includes faculty perceptions of their importance and effectiveness nor has the faculty assessment of eldercare policy been examined in relation to career success. Guided by an intersectional perspective, this study compares responses provided by four groups of faculty: African American women, African American men as well as white women and white men. Toward this end, I use data from the 2008 and 2009 Tenure-Track Faculty Job Satisfaction survey collected by the Collaborative on Academic Careers in Higher Education (<b>COACHE).</b> First, I examine faculty perceptions regarding the importance of family policies as related to career success, the effectiveness of family policies at the institution, and the level of satisfaction with work-life balance. Second, I examine the extent to which departmental and institutional support for care work affects the faculty member 2 ̆ 7 s overall satisfaction with the institution. The findings indicate that there are significant differences in policy perceptions within the intersectionally defined faculty groups as well as with overall satisfaction with work-life balance.
