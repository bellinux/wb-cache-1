40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{characterization}} of the conservation status of natural habitats from Buila-Vânturariţa National Park was maded. There were analyzed three types of habitats, according to NATURA 2000 classification, as follows: 8210 <b>Calcareous</b> <b>rocky</b> <b>slopes</b> with chasmophytic vegetation; 4070 * Bushes with Pinus mugo and Rhododendron hirsutu...|$|R
5|$|The site is {{characterized}} by a mosaic of 17 plant communities regrouped into three main types of ecological units: grassy open areas, shrubby areas and wooded areas. Of these, three are listed in the Habitats Directive. The <b>calcareous</b> <b>rocky</b> <b>slopes</b> with chasmophytic vegetation Cystopterido fragilis-Asplenietum scolopendrii are considered as exceptional, with a degree of uncertainty in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region. Hydrophilous tall herb fringe community with Petasites hybridus, at the limit of its range, is also exceptional. The herbaceous fringe with red campion (Silene dioica) et wood forget-me-not (Myosotis sylvatica) (Sileno dioicae - Myosotidetum sylvaticae) is very rare in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais. The wood-fringe Lathyro sylvestris – Astragaletum glycyphylli is also regionally interesting.|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} has been done of the flora and natural habitats of the Dospat Dere area, which is located on the right bank of the Dospat river, between the Tuhovitsa and Zhizhevo villages, next to the border with Greece. The systematic specter of the flora contains 197 species of vascular plants (excluding the moss species). These vascular plants are referred to 143 genera and 57 families. As a result of this research, 5 habitats were established: 10 Е 1 Pseudo-steppe with grasses and annual of the Thero-Brachypodietea, 08 H 3 <b>Calcareous</b> <b>rocky</b> <b>slopes</b> with chasmophytic vegetation, 21 G 1 Supra Mediterranean hop-hornbeam woods, 02 G 1 Southern Helleno-Balkanic swamp alder woods and 07 G 1 Helleno-Balkanic riparian plane forests...|$|R
50|$|Pupilla pratensis {{is typical}} habitat specialist. It is a {{pronounced}} hygrophilous species, inhabiting open, richer, often calcareous moist and wetland habitats. In Scandinavia {{it occurs in}} calcareous fens and meadows. The character of the sites in SE Norway (calcareous fen, sloping wetlands with springs) is in good accordance with this and with the habitats of Pupilla pratensis in Sweden; where it occurs as a typical species of open calcareous fens or wet, moist calcareous meadows. In Nordland County, Norway the habitats are of a different type, <b>calcareous,</b> <b>rocky</b> <b>slopes</b> close to the sea. Probably the wet climate in the western, coastal Norway {{makes it possible for}} the species to widen its ecological occurrence.|$|R
50|$|The shrub is {{evergreen}} {{and grows}} up to 1.0 m tall. It grows on <b>calcareous</b> rocks and <b>rocky</b> <b>slopes</b> at altitudes ranging from 3100 to 3300 m.|$|R
50|$|The typical {{habitat of}} this species is grassland, sand dunes and open {{woodland}} on <b>calcareous</b> soils, including <b>rocky</b> <b>slopes.</b> It prefers <b>calcareous</b> soils with neutral pH, with low nutritional value, {{at an altitude of}} 0 - 1200 m above sea level.|$|R
5000|$|The shrub is evergreen, {{and grows}} up to 0.6 meters tall. Its {{branches}} grow upright. Its flowers are white, with a purplish outside and it bears orange fruits. It is often found on <b>calcareous</b> rocks and <b>rocky</b> <b>slopes</b> at altitudes of 1700 to 2300 meters.|$|R
50|$|Chinkapin oak {{is closely}} related to the smaller but {{generally}} similar dwarf chinkapin oak (Quercus prinoides). Chinkapin oak is usually a tree, but occasionally shrubby, while dwarf chinkapin oak is a low-growing, clone-forming shrub. The two species generally occur in different habitats: chinquapin oak is typically found on <b>calcareous</b> soils and <b>rocky</b> <b>slopes,</b> while dwarf chinkapin oak is usually found on acidic substrates, primarily sand or sandy soils, and also dry shales.|$|R

40|$|A high <b>rocky</b> <b>slope</b> is an {{open complex}} giant system {{for which there is}} contradiction among {{different}} influencing factors and coexistence of qualitative and quantitative information. This study presents a comprehensive intelligent evaluation method of high <b>rocky</b> <b>slope</b> safety through an integrated analytic hierarchy process, extension matter element model and entropy weight to assess the safety behavior of the high <b>rocky</b> <b>slope.</b> The proposed intelligent evaluation integrates subjective judgments derived from the analytic hierarchy process with the extension matter model and entropy weight into a multiple indexes dynamic safety evaluation approach. A combined subjective and objective comprehensive evaluation process, a more objective study, through avoiding subjective effects on the weights, and a qualitative safety assessment and quantitative safety amount are presented in the proposed method. The detailed computational procedures were also provided to illustrate the integration process of the above methods. Safety analysis of one high <b>rocky</b> <b>slope</b> is conducted to illustrate that this approach can adequately handle the inherent imprecision and contradiction of the human decision-making process and provide the flexibility and robustness needed for the decision maker to better monitor the safety status of a high <b>rocky</b> <b>slope.</b> This study was the first application of the proposed integrated evaluation method in the safety assessment of a high <b>rocky</b> <b>slope.</b> The study also indicated that it can also be applied to other similar problems...|$|R
