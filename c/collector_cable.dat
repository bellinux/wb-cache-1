30|$|Electrical {{power cables}} in tidal turbine farms {{contribute}} a significant share to capital expenditure (CAPEX). As a result, the routing of electrical power cables connecting turbines to cable collector hubs must be designed {{so as to}} obtain the least cost configuration. This {{is referred to as}} a tidal cable routing problem. This problem possesses several variants depending on the number of cable collector hubs. In this paper, these variants are modeled by employing the approach of the single depot multiple traveling salesman problem (mTSP) and the multiple depot mTSP of operational research for the single and multiple cable collector variants, respectively. The developed optimization models are computationally implemented using MATLAB. In the triple cable <b>collector</b> <b>cable</b> hub variant, an optimal solution is obtained, while good-quality suboptimal solutions are obtained in the double and single cable collector hub variants. In practice, multiple cable collector hubs are expected to be employed as the multiple hub configurations tend to be more economic than the single hub configurations. This has been confirmed by this paper for an optimal tidal turbine layout obtained with OpenTidalFarm. Suggestions are presented for future research studies comprising a number of heuristics.|$|E
50|$|Referred {{to as the}} Main DC, larger power <b>collector</b> <b>cables</b> {{are used}} to {{interconnect}} from the Generator box {{also referred to as}} the DC combiner to the central inverter. IEC 62548 states that these cables must be shielded when over 50m in length.Central inverters are large frequency converters and unshielded cables would cause EMC issues throughout the whole solar farm which can behave like a capacitor.|$|R
5000|$|Turbine {{output is}} around 600 V AC and is {{converted}} to 34.5 kV by a transformer {{at the base of}} each tower. The output is gathered by a substation which combines the individual turbine contributions. Most <b>collector</b> <b>cabling</b> and associated control and monitoring fiber optic cable (up to 99 miles) is buried 3 ft underground. Exceptions are made for aerial cables to span terrain such as canyons, wetlands, and cultivated areas to protect the environment. Up to 15 mi of aerial cabling is permitted. [...] Bonneville Power Administration built a 12-mile 230 kV transmission line to collect the power. It has capacity for an expected additional 450 MW from two other proposed wind farms in Sherman County.|$|R
40|$|Medium Voltage <b>collector</b> <b>cables</b> of Wind Farms have metal shields {{connected}} to the grounding systems of the towers and of the connection station. Thanks to this bonding, when a ground fault occurs, the fault current splits itself among all the grounding systems of the wind farm, this causing a reduction of the ground potential rise at the fault location. Nevertheless, in presence of double ground faults, very high ground potential rises occur at the two fault locations and safety against electric shock is not always assured. In order to study this issue, the paper presents a model for simulating in a simple way the effects of double ground faults occurring in Medium Voltage collectors of extended wind plants {{connected to}} the High Voltage network...|$|R
40|$|Should {{search engines}} {{be subject to}} the types of {{regulation}} now applied to personal data <b>collectors,</b> <b>cable</b> networks, or phone books? In this article, we make the case for some regulation of the ability of search engines to manipulate and structure their results. We demonstrate that the First Amendment, properly understood, does not prohibit such regulation. Nor will such interventions inevitably lead to the disclosure of important trade secrets. After setting forth normative foundations for evaluating search engine manipulation, we explain how neither market discipline nor technological advance is likely to stop it. Though savvy users and personalized search may constrain abusive companies to some extent, they have little chance of checking untoward behavior by the oligopolists who now dominate the search market. Against the trend of courts that would declare search results unregulable speech, this article makes a case for an ongoing conversation on search engine regulation...|$|R
30|$|As {{with other}} {{renewable}} ocean energy technology systems, the major components of CAPEX in TCE are the turbine arrays and the electrical systems (generators, power cables, submarine connectors, and onshore substations), whereby in general the electrical system cost is typically 25 % of {{the total cost of}} the tidal farm [13]. In [14], it is pointed out that the substantial share of electrical systems, and particularly power cables, in total cost may, if not appropriately determined, play an adverse role in delaying the deployment of TCE. In [14], it is also shown that there are two major types of <b>cable</b> <b>collector</b> placements in a tidal farm: a single collector hub placement and a multiple hub placement.|$|R
50|$|In {{parabolic}} trough plants, copper is {{specified in the}} solar <b>collector</b> field (power <b>cables,</b> signals, earthing, electrical motors); steam cycle (water pumps, condenser fans, cabling to consumption points, control signal and sensors, motors), electricity generators (alternator, transformer), and storage systems (circulating pumps, cabling to consumption points). A 50 MW plant with 7.5 hours of storage contains approximately 196 tonnes of copper, of which 131,500 kg are in cables and 64,700 kg are in various equipment (generators, transformers, mirrors, and motors). This translates to about 3.9 tonnes/MW, or, in other terms, 1.2 tonnes/GWh/year. A plant {{of the same size}} without storage can have 20% less copper in the solar field and 10% less in the electronic equipment. A 100 MW plant will have 30% less relative copper content per MW in the solar field and 10% less in electronic equipment.|$|R
30|$|Due to {{the above}} reasons, the capital cost of OSWF will be higher. In addition, OSWF has higher {{maintenance}} and outage cost due to a critical operational environment and low accessibility [2]. Reduction in cost {{can be achieved by}} the optimized design of wind farm in terms of <b>collector</b> system and <b>cable</b> layout. In [3, 4], authors have used geometric programming and genetic algorithm (GA) respectively for optimization of the layout. In [5, 6], combination of improved GA and multiple travelling salesmen problem (MTSP) is proposed for the same context. GA approach discussed in [7] addresses the problem of the optimal micro siting of WTs. In [8], Bender’s decomposition strategy, scenario aggregation technique and progressive contingency incorporation techniques are applied to improve the computation time of optimal design. The fuzzy C-mean (FCM) with binary integer programming method is applied to automatically allocate the WTs to nearest substations [9]. Minimum spanning tree (MST) method was used for the design of an optimal electrical layout in [9, 10]. Finally, a hybrid AC-DC OSWF topology with mixed integer nonlinear programming method is used to obtain the optimal performances like cost minimization and reduction in a number of AC-DC power converters [1].|$|R
40|$|Tracer {{testing is}} a {{commonly}} used technique {{to determine the}} flow and percolation parameters required to configure juice distribution trays in a diffuser for efficient operation. Sodium chloride has become the preferred tracer medium for diffusers since the cost is low and, unlike other tracers such as lithium or fluorescent dye, it can be quantified in real time using conductivity change measurements. Early workers used commercial conductivity probes but these were expensive and a challenge to integrate into a convenient data acquisition system. In the previous two decades, the Sugar Milling Research Institute NPC (SMRI) developed a custom-made system which used probes suspended in containers of overflowing juice and linked to a central data <b>collector</b> using long <b>cables.</b> Variations in resistance as well as cable breakage meant that data were not always reliable. This paper describes {{the basic principles of}} operation and capabilities of a new conductivity tracer test system that has been developed by the SMRI. Flow-through conductivity cells with a temperature measurement are used. Each conductivity cell is connected to an outstation which in turn has a wireless link to a central base station. The base station is connected to a notebook computer through a USB port. Custom software was used to control the measurement and data acquisition process. The temperature compensated conductivities can be displayed in real time. The results of the tracer test (percolation velocities and angles) can be calculated immediately after completion of the test, allowing rapid feedback on the diffuser performance...|$|R
40|$|Two prototypes of {{pulsed power}} {{generators}} for a two-sectional LIA – specialized driver of a relativistic magnetron were constructed and tested. The driver for the double-sided powering of a relativistic magnetron {{consists of two}} identical sets of induction modules (two sections of LIA) with inner electrodes- vacuum adders connected to {{both sides of a}} coaxial magnetron. It provides the symmetric power flowing in a magnetron and a possibility of localising of the electron flow in magnetron interaction region. The first generator designed for a small-scale laboratory installation provides the output pulses of 100 ns in duration with voltage amplitude of 50 kV at repetition rate of 1 pps. The construction of the generator is based on the application of experimental capacitor banks designed as a pulse forming line with the next parameters: charging voltage – 80 kV, impedance – 1, 7 Ohm, pulse duration – 80 ns at a matched load. The second generator was designed for 1 MV integrated LIA – magnetron system. It consists of 4 -stage 200 kV Marx generator and two simultaneously charged water insulated pulse forming lines (PFL) with output gas switches. Coaxial PFL formed by 200 mm in diameter outer electrode and 150 mm inner one. Pressurised up to 3 atm of flowing N 2 gas switch is located at the output of each PFL in an intermediate section between the water insulated PFL and an oil insulated <b>cable</b> <b>collector.</b> 10 high voltage coaxial cables КВИ- 100 type with impedance of 20 Ohm are used for transmission of the output pulses from each PFL to the LIA modules. Amplitude of the pulses is 100 kV, duration – 80 ns, repetition rate – 10 pps. Work supported by RFBR under grant 03 - 02 - 17300...|$|R
