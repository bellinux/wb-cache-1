25|$|On 23 July 2009, the 17:33 {{service to}} Masterton hit a {{mudslide}} blocking the line {{just north of}} Maoribank tunnel near Maymorn. The locomotive, DCP4818, and the first carriage, SWG3422, derailed. Only minor injuries were reported, but the slip and the derailed rolling stock blocked the line, preventing services operating until Sunday evening. The accident highlighted a flaw {{in the design of}} the pneumatically-operated interior doors in the SW carriages, which stuck in position when the <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> was lost as a result of the locomotive being shut down. Three people were needed to open them by hand, sparking concerns that the carriages could not be evacuated quickly in the event of a fire. The doors were modified so they would open automatically if the <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> is lost.|$|E

50|$|Medical <b>air</b> is <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>supplied</b> by {{a special}} air compressor, through a dryer (in order to {{maintain}} correct dew point levels), and distributed to patient care areas. In smaller facilities, medical air may also be supplied via high-pressure cylinders. Pressures are maintained around 345-380 kPa (50-55 psi).|$|R
50|$|Aircraft {{with large}} gas turbine engines are {{typically}} started using a {{large volume of}} low-pressure <b>compressed</b> <b>air,</b> <b>supplied</b> from a very small engine {{referred to as a}}n auxiliary power unit, located elsewhere in the aircraft. Alternately, aircraft gas turbine engines can be rapidly started using a mobile ground-based pneumatic starting engine, referred to as a start cart or air start cart.|$|R
50|$|The Cavotec PCAir System (mobile or fixed) {{provides}} pre-compressed air to {{cool the}} cabin of passenger aircraft during ground handling. The unit is driven by dry <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>supplied</b> from a centralised, electrically powered compressor room. The system works on “capacity on demand” which constantly adjusts the capacity to the current demand, thereby minimising overall energy consumption and noise pollution.|$|R

50|$|In late 2009, all S, SE and SW {{carriages}} {{were required}} to be modified so that their pneumatically-operated interior doors open automatically if the <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> is lost. This was identified as an issue after the locomotive on a Wairarapa Connection train derailed when it hit a landslide on 23 July 2009, resulting in the locomotive having {{to be shut down}} and cutting the <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> to the SW carriages in the process. The doors stuck in position, and three people {{were required to}} open them manually, sparking safety concerns that the carriages could not be evacuated quickly {{in the event of a}} fire.|$|E
5000|$|Each pipe sits {{on top of}} a [...] "windchest", {{which is}} {{basically}} an airtight box filled with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>supplied</b> at a constant pressure by an air pump and air pressure regulators (bellows). Where each pipe connects to the windchest, there is a leather stopper which moves aside when the organist presses the appropriate key on the console. Air rushes into the pipe creating the sound.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{less common}} method for {{creating}} sparks {{is heating up}} the sample to red heat and then applying <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> to the sample. The <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>supplies</b> enough oxygen to ignite the sample and give off sparks. This method is more accurate than using a grinder because it will always give off sparks of the same length for the same sample. The <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> applies in essence the same [...] "pressure" [...] each time. This makes observations of the spark length a much more reliable characteristic for comparison.|$|R
50|$|Now let us {{assume that}} the power outage hits at T+0.5. The RPS is on a float {{uninterruptable}} power supply, so it continues to function; its sensors, however, are not, and thus the RPS assumes {{that they are all}} detecting emergency conditions. Within less than a second from power outage, auxiliary batteries and <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>supplies</b> are starting the Emergency Diesel Generators. Power will be restored by T+25 seconds.|$|R
50|$|Air-actuated valves are {{commonly}} used because of their simplicity, as they only require a <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>supply,</b> whereas electrically-operated valves require additional cabling and switch gear, and hydraulically-actuated valves required high pressure supply and return lines for the hydraulic fluid.|$|E

40|$|Spot welder {{designed}} for bonding insulated metal strips together. Compact, measuring only about 33. 5 cm in its largest linear dimension. Pinch welder clamps electrodes on weldments with strong, repeatable force. <b>Compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>supplied</b> through fitting on one handle. Small switch on same handle starts welding process when operator presses it with trigger. Provides higher, more repeatable clamping force than manually driven gun and thus produces weld joints of higher quality. Light in weight and therefore positioned precisely by operator...|$|R
25|$|Ambient air, of course, was the {{original}} machining coolant. <b>Compressed</b> <b>air,</b> <b>supplied</b> through pipes and hoses from an air compressor and discharged from a nozzle aimed at the tool, is sometimes a useful coolant. The force of the decompressing air stream blows chips away, and the decompression itself has a slight degree of cooling action. The net {{result is that the}} heat of the machining cut is carried away a bit better than by ambient air alone. Sometimes liquids are added to the air stream to form a mist (mist coolant systems, described above).|$|R
40|$|The simple counter-flow {{vortex tube}} {{consists}} of a long hollow cylinder with tangential nozzle at one end for injecting <b>compressed</b> <b>air.</b> <b>Compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>supplied</b> to the vortex tube is separated into low pressure hot and cold air from its two ends. The exact mechanism of this temperature separation is not known today. Most of the investigators have studied the various operating characteristics of vortex tube based on the cold air fraction. Vortex tubes of different geometrical configurations give optimum performance at different cold fractions. This paper presents experimental results of the energy separation in vortex tubes for different nozzle diameters keeping all other geometrical parameters constant. It is experimentally evidenced that the nozzle diameter greatly influences the separation performance and cooling efficiency. The most important point revealed in this paper {{is that there is}} an optimum nozzle diameter that gives the best performance of vortex tube. 1...|$|R
5000|$|It {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the larger, dry submersible called the Advanced SEAL Delivery System (ASDS). The SDV is flooded, and the swimmers ride exposed to the water, breathing from the vehicle's <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> or using their own SCUBA gear. (The ASDS is dry inside, with a full life support and air conditioning system.) ...|$|E
50|$|Next, {{consider}} the nozzle {{connected to a}} <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>supply.</b> With a pressure ratio of about 2, the flow becomes choked, and cannot exceed the speed of sound. But the density and resultant mass flow rate can be increased by increasing the inlet pressure. The greater the pressure, the greater the density, and the greater the mass flow. So, while Kantrowitz limits the maximum gas velocity, it does not apply any fixed limit to the mass flow rate.|$|E
50|$|The {{braking system}} uses Wabtec's Fastbrake control system; {{there are two}} disc brakes per axle, as well as wheel tread brakes. The {{mechanical}} parts of the brake system were supplied by Faiveley Transport. <b>Compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> is charged through a Knorr screw compressor with a capacity of 3400 lmin−1 at 10 bar pressure, stored two 480 liter air reservoirs. The dynamic and regenerative braking system operates under all three NJT electrical systems. In addition, the locomotive, while in diesel mode, is capable of routing power generated by the electric brake to HEP and locomotive auxiliary power requirements {{in addition to the}} dynamic brake resistor.|$|E
50|$|Elizabeth II {{visited the}} {{lighthouse}} in 1956, {{with the young}} Duke of Cornwall and the Princess Anne. The seven-year-old {{heir to the throne}} sounded the first blast on a new fog siren. The fog signal was operated by <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>supplied</b> from a compressor, driven by a Kelvin Diesel engine. There were three Kelvin engines and compressors, and when the fog signal was in operation, two of them were in service to maintain the required air pressure with one standby, in rotation. In 1984, the fog signal was discontinued and the fog horn building was demolished.|$|R
50|$|In a ducted rocket, a {{solid fuel}} gas {{generator}} produces a hot fuel-rich gas which is burnt in the ramcombustor with the <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>supplied</b> by the intake(s). The flow of gas improves {{the mixing of}} the fuel and air and increases total pressure recovery. In a throttleable ducted rocket, {{also known as a}} variable flow ducted rocket, a valve allows the gas generator exhaust to be throttled allowing control of the thrust. Unlike an LFRJ, solid propellant ramjets cannot flame out. The ducted rocket sits somewhere between the simplicity of the SFRJ and the unlimited throttleability of the LFRJ.|$|R
5000|$|A {{pneumatic}} tool, air tool, air-powered tool or pneumatic-powered tool {{is a type}} {{of power}} tool, driven by <b>compressed</b> <b>air,</b> <b>supplied</b> by an <b>air</b> compressor. Pneumatic tools can also be driven by compressed carbon dioxide (...) stored in small cylinders allowing for portability. Pneumatic tools are safer to run and maintain than their electric power tool equivalents, and have a higher power-to-weight ratio, allowing a smaller, lighter tool to accomplish the same task. General grade pneumatic tools with short life span are commonly cheaper and are also called disposable tools in tooling industries while industrial grade pneumatic tools with long life span are more expensive. In general, pneumatic tools are cheaper than the equivalent electric-powered tools.|$|R
50|$|An {{air line}} is a tube, or hose, that carries a <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>supply,</b> e.g. to inflate tyres or power compressed-air tools. Air line is most {{commonly}} used for supplying compressed air to air tools in workshops and in road vehicle air brake or railway air brake systems on larger vehicles or rail cars. The most common sizes of air tubing are one quarter inch and three eights inch outside diameter tubing although a complete range of tubing in both standard and metric sizes is available. Air lines are also used for diving where s compressor or a hand-powered air pump supplies air to a diver.|$|E
50|$|Typically, the airlift is {{constructed}} from a 3-metre to 10 metre long, 10 cm diameter pipe. A controllable <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> vents into the inside, {{lower end of}} the pipe (The input end always being the lower end). Compressed air is injected into the pipe in one to three second bursts with an interval long enough to let the resulting bubble to rise to the higher, output end of the pipe. The bubble moves water through the pipe sucking debris from the lower end and depositing it from {{the upper end of the}} pipe. Ejected debris can be either cast off (as in simply removing overburden) or collected in a mesh cage for inspection (as more often is the case in nautical archaeology). It is often designed to be hand-operated by a diver.|$|E
5000|$|The {{diaphone}} horn {{was based}} {{directly on the}} organ stop {{of the same name}} invented by Robert Hope-Jones, creator of the Wurlitzer organ. Hope-Jones' design was based on a piston that was closed only at its bottom end and had slots, perpendicular to its axis, cut through its sides; the slotted piston moved within a similarly slotted cylinder. Outside of the cylinder was a reservoir of high-pressure air. Initially, high-pressure air would be admitted behind the piston, pushing it forward. When the slots of the piston aligned with those of the cylinder, air passed into the piston, making a sound and pushing the piston back to its starting position, whence the cycle would repeat. [...] A modification of Hope-Jones' design was patented by John Pell Northey, head of the Northey Co. Ltd. of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, which manufactured pumps and small gasoline engines. [...] Northey added a secondary <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> to the piston in order to power it during both its forward and reverse strokes and thus create an even more powerful sound. The entire horn apparatus was driven by a compressor.|$|E
40|$|The report {{deals with}} a {{two-stroke}} diesel engines, which are started by <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> and where fuel is not injected in cylinders during starting process. Only when speed of crankshaft rotation is sufficient to ensure ignition of fuel in cylinders the starting <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> is interrupted and the fuel is injected in cylinders. The differential equation of the first revolution of crankshaft motion was done, and offered a very simple numerical integration scheme. By way of example calculations are carried out for a particular engine as in case where <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> is <b>supplied</b> to all cylinders {{as well as the}} <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> is delivered only to half of the cylinders...|$|R
40|$|The {{sugar cane}} {{industry}} uses brake vans, coupled {{to the end}} of cane trains, to produce a given constant braking force to improve the cane bin ride dynamics and to assist the braking of trains. Unlike other railway vehicles, cane bins often have neither brakes or suspensions. Currently brake vans operate using <b>compressed</b> <b>air,</b> <b>supplied</b> by an on board compressor, which activates a brake calliper, which clamps a ventilated disc rotor on each of the four wheel sets. This system needs maintenance due to wear on the brake pads and rotors. An electrical braking implemented using self-excited induction generator is proposed. With the application of electrical braking energy is dissipated is in well ventilated resistors. Maintenance is further reduced by a brushless design. 1...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} design and {{potential}} of an automobile that is powered by <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>supplied</b> from an on board store charged by a separate compressor. That store is a carbon fibre sphere of 250 litres capacity and, once charged with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> to 30 MPa, has a specific energy density the equal of conventional Ni-Mh electrochemical batteries. It is shown that this store can be built to a safe international standard and it is reasonable that the store {{can be expected to}} have a life equivalent {{to the life of the}} vehicle. In contrast, all electric vehicle batteries can be expected to have a life of 3 – 5 years. The range and efficiency of the vehicle are contributed to by a lightweight heat pipe based heat exchanger that takes heat from ambient air and uses it to raise the temperature of the <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> stream that is initially at 60 K below ambient temperatures. The <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> stream’s temperature is raised to within 10 K of the ambient temperature and that increase in enthalpy makes a significant difference to the performance of the system.

50|$|In 1995, {{an entirely}} new {{transmission}} design was developed, the VT 611/612, for high-speed trains with tilting technology used by the Deutsche Bahn (German Railways). This new transmission concept used a converter-coupling-coupling design with an integrated hydrodynamic T 312 bre retarder {{and it had a}} power rating of 650 kW. To shorten the transmission's overall length, a twin shaft construction was used over the high gears, which was similar to the design used in reversing units. The electronic control unit was also built into the transmission. In addition, the transmission's reversing cylinders were operated hydraulically, which eliminated the need of having a <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> on board. Five years later, the T 212 bre transmission was developed with a power rating of 460 kW. This transmission was similar in design, but unlike other large transmissions the T 212 bre could be mounted directly on the drive motor. This was a significant advantage, because it resulted in a very compact motor-transmission combination for high-speed trains which could travel at up to 200 km/h. The T 212 bre had the same hydrodynamic circuit dimensions as the T 211 r, but it had the further advantage of greater coupling efficiency for trains operating at only 50% of their maximum speed. For high-speed diesel trains this was important, because it permitted dramatically improved fuel consumption.|$|E
5000|$|Levins modeled his {{costume and}} {{equipment}} after those created by Jason Philip Macendale, Jr.—the first Jack O'Lantern. Levins wore a complete body armor made of metal-mesh covered in multi-segmented Kevlar panels, incorporating a rigid, articulated shell which can resist a 7-pound bazooka anti-tank warhead. He wore a bulletproof helmet with an internal three hour, <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>supply.</b> The helmet {{is equipped with}} a telescopic infrared image-intensifier for seeing in the dark and 360 degree scanning device for seeing all around himself. The base of the helmet {{is equipped with a}} fine network of pinholes which maintain a low temperature, low density flame ("stage-fire") that rings the helmet at all times. The air supply cools the helmet's interior. The helmet is padded to protect his head from injury. Levins is armed with wrist-blasters which can deliver an electrical shock within a range of 35 ft. He also used various types of grenades, including anesthetic, lachrymatory (tear gas), hallucinogenic, and regurgitant gas grenades, smoke grenades, and concussion grenades. The grenades are shaped like spheres or pumpkins. He can fire small grenades from wrist devices. He can also release [...] "ghost-grabbers," [...] which are thick, semi-transparent films which adhere to a victim. Levins rides atop a one-man hovercraft with an electric motor powered by a high density lithium rechargeable battery.|$|E
5000|$|In its {{original}} configuration, designated the Ju 52/1m, the Ju 52 was a single-engined aircraft, powered by either a BMW IV or Junkers liquid-cooled V-12 engine. However, the single-engine model was underpowered, and after seven prototypes had been completed, all subsequent Ju 52s were built with three radial engines as the Ju 52/3m (drei motoren — [...] "three engines"). Originally powered by three Pratt & Whitney R-1690 Hornet radial engines, later production models mainly received 574 kW (770 hp) BMW 132 engines, a licence-built refinement of the Pratt & Whitney design. Export models were also built with 447 kW (600 hp) Pratt & Whitney R-1340 Wasp and 578 kW (775 hp) Bristol Pegasus VI engines. The two wing-mounted radial engines of the Ju 52/3m had half-chord cowlings and in planform view (from above/below) {{appeared to be}} splayed outwards, being mounted at an almost perpendicular angle to the tapered wings sweptback leading edge (in a similar fashion to the Mitsubishi G3M bomber and Short Sunderland; the angled engines on the Ju 52 were intended {{to make it easier}} to maintain straight flight should an engine fail, while the others had different reasons). The three engines had either Townend ring or NACA cowlings to reduce drag from the engine cylinders, although a mixture of the two was most common (as can been seen in many of the accompanying photographs), with deeper-chord NACA ducts on the wing engines and a narrow Townend ring on the center engine (which was more difficult to fit a deeper NACA cowl onto, due to the widening fuselage behind the engine). Production Ju 52/3m aircraft flown by Luft Hansa before World War II, as well as Luftwaffe-flown Ju 52s flown during the war, usually used an air-start system to turn over their trio of radial engines, using a common <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> that also operated the main wheels brakes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> can be <b>supplied</b> from an {{on-board}} {{auxiliary power}} unit (APU), a portable gas generator used by ground crew or by cross feeding bleed air from a running engine {{in the case of}} multi-engined aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Air {{bearings}} {{belong to}} slide bearings. Pressurized air {{acts as a}} lubricant in the gap between bearing moving parts. The air cushion carries the load without any contact between the moving parts. Normally, the <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> is <b>supplied</b> by a compressor. A key goal of <b>supplying</b> the <b>air</b> pressure in the gap is that the stiffness and damping of the air cushion reaches the highest possible level. In addition, air consumption and uniformity of <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> into the gap are crucial for the behaviors of air bearings.|$|R
40|$|Fixing leaks once is not enough. Incorporate a leak {{prevention}} program into operations at your facility. It should include identification and tagging, tracking, repair, verification, and employee involvement.
