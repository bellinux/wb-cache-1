Within the arts program, chorus, creative writing, drama, art, and three levels of orchestra are offered as optional activities. Students in these groups have opportunities to perform and exhibit their work throughout the year. The Book Club is available to students in groups six and above to extend the reading program.

5|$|Yaginuma's work {{prior to}} {{serialization}} introduces readers to Asumi Kamogawa and her mentor, {{the ghost of}} a Lion astronaut whom she calls Mr. Lion. Their friendship develops in several short stories in which, throughout her childhood, he nurtures Asumi's interest in space. As her interest and dreams grow, Asumi is often ridiculed by classmates, especially because she immerses herself in books about space and rarely engages in <b>classroom</b> <b>activities.</b> When she decides to apply for admission to the Tokyo Space Academy, her teachers urge her to reconsider because she is below average height. Her friendship with Mr. Lion continues to grow after Asumi successfully enters the academy, and she often consults him during periods of self-doubt.|$|E

25|$|Improving the {{surrounding}} {{home and school}} environment can improve the behavior of children with ADHD. Parents of children with ADHD often show similar deficits themselves, and thus {{may not be able}} to sufficiently help the child with his or her difficulties. Improving the parents' understanding of the child's behavior and teaching them strategies to improve functioning and communication and discourage unwanted behavior has measurable effect on the children with ADHD. The different educational interventions for the parents are jointly called Parent Management Training. Techniques include operant conditioning: a consistent application of rewards for meeting goals and good behavior (positive reinforcement) and punishments such as time-outs or revocation of privileges for failing to meet goals or poor behavior. Classroom management is similar to parent management training; educators learn about ADHD and techniques to improve behavior applied to a classroom setting. Strategies utilized include increased structuring of <b>classroom</b> <b>activities,</b> daily feedback, and token economy.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} teachers’ zone of proximal development for <b>classroom</b> physical <b>activity</b> breaks by assessing teachers’ knowledge and capacity for implementing <b>classroom</b> physical <b>activity</b> breaks. Five school districts {{of various sizes}} (n= 346 teachers) {{took part in a}} short online survey. Descriptive statistics were calculated and chi-square analyses were used to identify differences between districts. Almost all teachers utilized <b>classroom</b> physical <b>activity</b> to some extent. A third of teachers who stated they implemented <b>classroom</b> physical <b>activity,</b> experienced barriers to implementation. A majority of teachers were interested in learning more about <b>classroom</b> physical <b>activity.</b> There were significant differences between districts on the number of days per week <b>classroom</b> physical <b>activity</b> was integrated, the frequency of collaboration that occurred between teachers, the percentage of teachers who experienced barriers, and preferred delivery method of professional development. These findings support the importance of identifying teachers’ zone of proximal development to increase the use of <b>classroom</b> physical <b>activity</b> breaks. Understanding teachers’ knowledge and capacity for implementing <b>classroom</b> physical <b>activity</b> breaks can allow educational professionals to shift the implementation of <b>classroom</b> physical <b>activity</b> beyond sporadic use by isolated teachers and schools to a more systematic and consistent delivery across classrooms and throughout districts...|$|R
