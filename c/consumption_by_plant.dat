The paper introduces a realistic mathematical {{model in which}} all the processes and phenomena associated with the biological CO 2 capture and utilization by photosynthesis inside greenhouses are considered. The model validity and accuracy were ensured through the good agreement of its numerical predictions with the available experimental results in the literature. The effect of different environmental and planting conditions on the CO 2 capturing process (the photosynthesis process) is investigated. A case study was chosen to investigate the effects of the cooling method, cooling temperature, planting conditions, and CO 2 concentration level on the cumulative amount of captured CO 2 which represents the greenhouse capturing performance. The results show that the capturing performance of greenhouse can be enhanced from value as low as 1.0  g CO 2 /m 2  day for ventilated greenhouses with low planting density to a value as high as 140  g CO 2 /m 2  day for high planting density when alternative microclimate control methods and CO 2 enrichment are applied, considering the appropriate plant type.

The water uptake ability (i. e. water consumption per unit dry matter per day) of three synthetic-derived bread wheat genotypes, SYN- 8, SYN- 10 and SYN- 15, and their parental variety Cham 6 were examined under controlled conditions. In addition, yield performance was compared under one artificial environment with supplemental irrigation and ten rain-fed environments at two locations over five cropping seasons. Large {{differences were found in}} water uptake ability among the four wheat genotypes; SYN- 8 had the highest and SYN- 10 the lowest ability.

Significant differences of the grain yield were found between SYN- 8 and SYN- 10 grown in rain-fed conditions. Lower water uptake ability was associated with higher grain yield; this speculates that intensive extraction of water from soil during vegetative growth might increase biomass production, but leave inadequate available soil moisture for reproductive growth and grain production.

The experimental design was in randomized blocks using factorial 5 × 2 × 2, referring to five levels of saline water (0. 5; 1. 5; 3. 0; 4. 5; 6. 0 dS nr- 1) in soil without and with bovine biofertilizer and in pots without and with drainage. In plants the water consumption, growth in height, stem diameter, number of leaves, dry matter of roots, aerial part and total dry mass were evaluated and in soil the electrical conductivity of saturation extract - EC was determined.

In particular, grazing is known to directly affect CO 2 exchange through <b>consumption</b> <b>by</b> <b>plants,</b> cattle respiration, natural fertilisation through excreta, and soil compaction. This study investigates the impact of two grazing methods on the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) dynamics and carbon balance, by measuring CO 2 fluxes using eddy covariance in two adjacent pastures located in southern Belgium during a complete grazing season. Rotational (RG) grazing consists of an alternation of rest periods and short high stock density grazing periods. Continuous grazing (CG) consists of uninterrupted grazing with variable stocking rates. To our knowledge, this is the first study {{to assess the impact of}} these grazing methods on total net ecosystem exchange and CO 2 exchange dynamics using eddy covariance. The results showed that NEE dynamics were greatly impacted by the grazing method. Following grazing events on the RG parcel, net CO 2 uptake on the RG parcel was reduced compared to the CG parcel. During the following rest periods, this phenomenon progressively shifted towards a higher assimilation for the RG treatment. This behaviour was attributed to sharp biomass changes in the RG treatment and therefore sharp changes in plant photosynthetic capacity. We found that differences in gross primary productivity at high radiation were strongly correlated to differences in standing biomass. In terms of carbon budgets, no significant difference was observed between the two treatments, neither in cumulative NEE, or in terms of estimated biomass production. The results of our study suggest that we should not expect major benefits in terms of CO 2 uptake from rotational grazing management when compared to continuous grazing management in intensively managed temperate pastures.

Evapotranspiration was estimated by the Penman-Monteith equation using meteorological data from a station located on the experimental site. Soil water content in the root-influenced zone (0 – 60 cm depth) was hourly monitored each 20 cm (0 – 20 cm, 20 – 40 cm, and 40 – 60 cm) using FDR. Evaluations were performed on days with slight or no rainfall. During the study period, the magnitude of the diurnal soil water loss was more evident in the first layer (0 – 20 cm depth) and less important in the subsequent soil layers. The greatest consumption occurred between 14 and 19 h, up to 53. 64 % of the total. Overall, daily water consumption increased significantly with soil water content (p-value < 0. 001). In general, water losses from the 0 – 20 cm soil layer were greater than in subsoil horizons due to maize water-uptake and evaporation. In contrast, water content in the deepest part of the soil profile was close to saturation, even on the driest days of the studied period. Evapotranspiration overestimate maize water requirements as its values were greater than those measured with the probe. In conclusion, FDR allows a more accurate estimation of the soil water balance. Therefore, monitoring soil water content would be useful in the assessment of saturation risks or water stress (drought), thus aiding in the decision making, for instance, in irrigation management.

Knowledge about temporal variability in these fluxes is very limited, yet critical for proper study design and evaluating flux data. Further, to understand {{the reasons for the}} variability and allow predictive modeling, the temporal variability has to be related to relevant environmental variables. Here we analyzed the effect of weather variables on CH 4 and CO 2 flux from a small shallow pond during a period of 4 months. Mean CH 4 flux and surface water CH 4 concentration were 8. 0 [3. 3 - 15. 1] +/- A 3. 1 mmol m(- 2) day(- 1) (mean [range] +/- A 1 SD) and 1. 3 [0. 3 - 3. 5] +/- A 0. 9 A mu M respectively. Mean CO 2 flux was 1. 1 [- 9. 8 to 16. 0] +/- A 6. 9 mmol m(- 2) day(- 1). Substantial diel changes in CO 2 flux and surface water CH 4 concentration were observed during detailed measurements over a 24 h cycle. Thus diel patterns need to be accounted for in future measurements. Significant positive correlations of CH 4 emissions with temperature were found and could include both direct temperature effects as well as indirect effects (e. g. related to the growth season and macrophyte primary productivity providing organic substrates). CO 2 flux on the other hand was negatively correlated to temperature and solar radiation, presumably because CO 2 <b>consumption</b> <b>by</b> <b>plants</b> was higher relative to CO 2 production by respiration during warm sunny days. Interestingly, CH 4 fluxes were comparable to ponds with similar morphometry and macrophyte abundance in the tropics.

Data indicate that CH 4 emissions, given the system characteristic frameworks, is positively affected by increased temperatures or prolonged growth seasons...|$|R

To overcome this challenge, our paper uses a novel dataset on the mid- 20 th century expansion of the U. S. power grid to study the costs and the benefits of coal-fired electricity generation. The empirical analysis exploits the timing of coal-fired power plant openings and annual variation in plant-level coal consumption from 1938 to 1962, when emissions were virtually unregulated. Pollution from the burning of coal for electricity generation is shown to have quantitatively important and nonlinear effects on county-level infant mortality rates.

Because greenhouse space is expensive, productivity is critical for a profitable operation. A production strategy, called the conveyor production system (CPS), was developed using thin-film technology for plant production in dilute aquaculture effluents. With the CPS, young plants were positioned near the solution inlet in a gutter receiving the effluent and moved progressively, like along a conveyor belt, towards the outlet as they grew. Luxury <b>consumption</b> <b>by</b> lettuce <b>plants</b> (Lactuca sativa L. cv.

Reliable estimates of the total evapotranspiration from the wetland is useful information both for understanding the hydrological process and for water management to protect this natural environment. Due to the heterogeneity of the vegetation types and canopy density and of soil water content over the wetland (specifically over the natural reserve areas), it is difficult to estimate the regional evapotranspiration extrapolating measurements or calculations usually done locally for a specific land cover type. Remote sensing can provide observations of land surface conditions with high spatial and temporal resolution and coverage. In this study, a model based on the Energy Balance method was used to calculate daily evapotranspiration (ET) using instantaneous observations of land surface reflectance and temperature from MODIS when the data were available on clouds-free days. A time series analysis algorithm was then applied to generate a time series of daily ET over a year period by filling the gaps in the observation series due to clouds. A detailed vegetation classification map was used to help identifying areas of various wetland vegetation types in the YRD wetland.

40|$|Ecologists hold {{two views}} {{about the role of}} {{herbivory}} in ecosystem dynamics. First, from a food web perspective in population/community ecology, <b>consumption</b> <b>by</b> herbivores reduces <b>plant</b> abundance. Second, from a nutrient cycling perspective in ecosystem ecology, herbivory sometimes slows down cycling, which decreases plant abundance, but at other times speeds up cycling, which possibly increases plant abundance. The nutrient cycling perspective on herbivory has been experimentally addressed more thoroughly in aquatic systems than in terrestrial systems. We experimentally examined how grasshoppers influence nutrient cycling and, thereby, plant abundance and plant species composition over a period of 5 years. We examined how grasshoppers influence nutrient (nitrogen) cycling (i) by their excrement, (ii) by changing the abundance of and the decomposition rate of plant litter, and (iii) by both. Grasshoppers may speed up nitrogen cycling by changing the abundance and decomposition rate of plant litter, which increases total plant abundance (up to 32. 9 g/m 2 or 18 %), especially, the abundance of plants that are better competitors when nitrogen is more available. However, whether grasshoppers enhance plant abundance depends on how much they consume. Consequently, ecosystems and food web perspectives are not mutually exclusive. Finally, under some conditions, grasshoppers may decrease nutrient cycling and plant abundance...|$|R
30|$|Leopard cat hairs {{were found}} in large numbers in stomach and scat samples from the visual {{analysis}} and sequencing results (8 of 56 samples analyzed were confirmed as leopard cat hair). Hairs in stomach and scat samples are most likely {{a result of their}} own grooming rather than cannibalism (Grassman et al. 2005). Plants comprised 9.1 % of the stomach contents. Given that chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and Alaskan brown bears (Ursus arctos) consume high-fiber items to control parasites (Huffman 1997), it is possible that this is the same reason for plant consumption among leopard cats. In addition, a few studies suggested that this phenomenon is an unintentional consequence of feeding on animal prey, and that <b>consumption</b> of <b>plants</b> <b>by</b> the snow leopard Uncia uncia and leopard cat P. bengalensis is likely to provide mineral or vitamin supplements, which cannot easily be obtained from animal prey (Shehzad et al. 2012). However, it remains unclear whether the plants were accidentally or intentionally eaten.|$|R

These agents trigger excavations, or paths, <b>by</b> <b>consumption</b> of <b>plant</b> inner tissues <b>by</b> larvae of several insects. The {{aim of this}} work was to investigate leaf miner occurrence in Commelina diffusa (a cosmopolitan plant) and Floscopa glabrata (an amphibious plant) using anatomical techniques. The place where the plants were collected is subjected to seasonal floods, consequently both the species {{were exposed to the}} same weather conditions and seasonal floods. This study showed that members of Agromyzidae and Chironomidae families, which are Diptera endophytophagous larvae types, were responsible for the tunnels. Moreover, in Commelina diffusa Agromyzidae larvae were found, while in Floscopa glabrata three Chironomidae cephalic exuviae were found. The miners, as can be seen from anatomical studies, used only mesophyll parenchyma tissues for feeding, causing the formation of linear mines. In addition, in both the species, the epidermis and the medium-sized vascular units were kept intact, showing no structural modification, such as neoformation of tissues...|$|R
40|$|The least {{limiting}} {{water range}} (LLWR) was introduced as an integrated soil water content indicator, measuring {{the impact of}} mechanical impedance, oxygen and water availability on water uptake and crop growth. However, a rigorous definition of the upper limit of the LLWR using plant physiological and soil physical concepts was not given. We introduce in this study an upper limit of the LLWR, based on soil physical and plant physiological properties. We further evaluate the sensitivity of this boundary to different soil and crop variables, and compare {{the sensitivity of the}} upper limit of the LLWR to previous definitions of soil water content at field capacity. The current study confirms that the upper limit of the LLWR can be predicted from knowledge of the soil moisture characteristic curve, plant root depth and oxygen consumption rate. The sensitivity analysis shows further that the upper limit of the LLWR approaches the volumetric soil water content at saturation when the oxygen <b>consumption</b> rate <b>by</b> <b>plants</b> becomes less than 2 A mu mol m(- 3) s(- 1). When plants are susceptible to aeration (e. g. potato and avocado), {{there is a big difference}} between the upper limit of the LLWR and the soil water content at field capacity, in particular for sandy soils. Results also show that the soil water content at aeration porosity corresponding to 10 % cannot be considered as an appropriate upper limit of LLWR because it does not appropriately reflect the crop water requirements. Similar poor results are obtained when considering the soil water content at matric potential - 0. 033 MPa or when defining the soil water content at field capacity based on drainage flux rate. It is observed that the upper limit of the LLWR is higher than either soil water content at - 0. 033 MPa matric potential or soil water content at field capacity as based on drainage flux rate, especially in sandy soils...|$|R
