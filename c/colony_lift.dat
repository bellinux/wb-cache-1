40|$|E. coli O 157 :H 7 is a food-borne {{adulterant}} {{that can}} cause hemorrhagic ulcerative colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome. Faced with an increasing risk of foods contaminated with E. coli O 157 :H 7, food safety officials are seeking improved methods to detect and isolate E. coli O 157 :H 7 in hazard analysis and critical control point systems in meat- and poultry-processing plants. A <b>colony</b> <b>lift</b> immunoassay was developed to facilitate the positive identification and quantification of E. coli O 157 :H 7 by incorporating a simple <b>colony</b> <b>lift</b> enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with filter monitors and traditional culture methods. Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, Mass.) were prewet with methanol and were used to make replicates of every bacterial colony on agar plates or filter monitor membranes that were then reincubated for 15 to 18 h at 36 ± 1 °C, during which the colonies not only remained viable but were reestablished. The membranes were dried, blocked with blocking buffer (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories [KPL], Gaithersburg, Md.), and exposed for 7 min to an affinity-purified horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-E. coli O 157 antibody (KPL). The membranes were washed, exposed to a 3, 3 ′, 5, 5 ′-tetramethylbenzidine membrane substrate (TMB; KPL) or aminoethyl carbazole (AEC; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.), rinsed in deionized water, and air dried. Colonies of E. coli O 157 :H 7 were identified by either a blue (via TMB) or a red (via AEC) color reaction. The colored spots on the PVDF lift membrane were then matched to their respective parent colonies on the agar plates or filter monitor membranes. The <b>colony</b> <b>lift</b> immunoassay was tested {{with a wide range}} of genera in the family Enterobacteriaceae as well as different serotypes within the E. coli genus. The <b>colony</b> <b>lift</b> immunoassay provided a simple, rapid, and accurate method for confirming the presence of E. coli O 157 :H 7 colonies isolated on filter monitors or spread plates by traditional culture methods. An advantage of using the <b>colony</b> <b>lift</b> immunoassay is the ability to test every colony serologically on an agar plate or filter monitor membrane simultaneously for the presence of the E. coli O 157 antigen. This <b>colony</b> <b>lift</b> immunoassay has recently been successfully incorporated into a rapid-detection, isolation, and quantification system for E. coli O 157 :H 7, developed in our laboratories for retail meat sampling...|$|E
40|$|Bordetella bronchiseptica and toxigenic Pasteurella multocida are the {{etiologic}} {{agents of}} swine atrophic rhinitis. Methods currently used for their identification are time-consuming and {{suffer from a}} lack of sensitivity. We describe a colony lift-hybridization assay for detection of B. bronchiseptica and toxigenic P. multocida that can be performed with a single <b>colony</b> <b>lift</b> derived from a primary isolation plate without the need for pure subcultures of suspect bacteria. Membranes are hybridized simultaneously to probes derived from the B. bronchiseptica alcA gene and the P. multocida toxA gene. A multicolor development procedure permits sequential detection of bound probes. The assay was tested with 84 primary isolation plates generated from nasal swabs from swine with clinical signs of atrophic rhinitis. Comparison of the results from the colony lift-hybridization assay with those from conventional testing, based on a combination of colony morphology, biochemical reactions, mouse lethality, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, indicated that the <b>colony</b> <b>lift</b> assay has superior sensitivity and comparable specificity. This technique has wide application for diagnostic and experimental studies...|$|E
40|$|Our {{research}} is directed towards enhancing {{the understanding of}} the molecular biology of dengue virus replication with the ultimate goal being to develop novel antiviral strategies based on preventing critical inter- or intra-molecular interactions required for the normal virus life cycle. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS 5) and the viral helicase (NS 3) interaction offers a possible target for inhibitors to bind and prevent replication. In this study the yeast-two hybrid system was used to show that a small region of NS 5 interacts with NS 3, and also with the cellular nuclear transport receptor importin-β. Furthermore, intramolecular interaction between the two putative domains of NS 5 can also be detected by the yeast two-hybrid assay. We have also modified the <b>colony</b> <b>lift</b> assay for the β-galactosidase reporter activity in intact yeast cells which reflects the strength of interaction between two proteins to a microtiter plate format. This assay offers a unique opportunity to screen for small molecule compounds that block physiologically important interactions...|$|E

40|$|The {{identification}} of differentially expressed genes {{is a key}} step {{in the understanding of}} specific molecular mechanisms. Various methods have been developed to search for differences in expression but most of them are time or money consuming. We present here an alternative technique that connects standard suppression subtractive hybridization with in situ screening of bacteria to isolate and identify differentially expressed transcripts. The in situ differential screening is based on the transfer of bacteria directly from cultures onto nylon membranes with no need of phenol/chloroform extraction, <b>colony</b> <b>lifting,</b> or polymerase chain reaction amplification. This improved method was successfully applied and must be seen as a simple, low-cost, time-saving, and reproducible approach to identify differentially expressed genes...|$|R
40|$|Nucleotide binding {{properties}} of the G protein ɑ subunit G_oɑ were probed by mutational analysis in recombinant Escherichia coli. Thousands of random mutations generated by polymerase chain reaction were screened by in situ [^(35) S]GTPyS (guanosine 5 '-(3 -O-thio) -triphosphate) binding on the <b>colony</b> <b>lifts</b> following transformation of bacteria with modified G_oɑ cDNA. Clones that did not bind the nucleotide under these conditions were characterized by DNA sequence analysis, and the nucleotide binding properties were further studied in crude bacterial extracts. A number of novel mutations reducing the affinity of G_oɑ for GTPyS or Mg^(2 +) were identified. Some of the mutations substitute amino acid residues homologous to those known to interact with guanine nucleotides in p 21 ^(ras) proteins. Other mutations show that previously unstudied residues also participate in the nucleotide binding. Several mutants lost GTPyS binding but retained the capacity {{to interact with the}} βy subunit complex as determined by pertussis toxin-mediated ADP-ribosylation. One of these, mutant S 47 C, was functionally expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes along with the G protein-coupled thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptor. Whereas wild-type G_oɑ increased TRH-promoted chloride currents, S 47 C significantly decreased the hormone-induced Cl^- response, suggesting that this mutation resulted in a dominant negative phenotype...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{technique}} in which rRNA-targeted oligodeoxynucleotide probes {{are used to}} identify bacteria immobilized on membranes is described. By using colony lifts, bacteria are directly transferred from plates to untreated nitrocellulose membranes. Alternatively, cells resuspended from colonies {{can be applied to}} membranes by using a vacuum manifold under high-salt conditions. Blotted cells are baked and hybridized under stringent conditions by using standard protocols. Treatment of blotted cells with sodium dodecyl sulfate, urea, formaldehyde, or protease had no apparent effect on hybridization signals. Hybridization to rRNA from cells that had been stored refrigerated for 6 days was readily detected; however, fivefold more cells (approximately 10 (7) cells) were required to obtain hybridization signals comparable to those generated by cells not subjected to storage. The sequences of oligonucleotide probes specific for Pseudomonas cepacia, Comamonas testosteroni, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and a group probe identifying Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas mendocina, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Comamonas acidovorans, and "Flavobacterium" lutescens are presented. In conjunction with the <b>colony</b> <b>lift</b> hybridization procedure, bacteria isolated from river water were identified by using these probes...|$|E
40|$|Directed {{evolution}} {{methods were}} developed for Cu-containing nitrite reductase (NiR) from Alcaligenes faecalis S- 6. The PCR cloning strategy {{allows for the}} efficient production of libraries of 100 000 clones by a modification of a megaprimer-based whole-plasmid synthesis reaction. The high-throughput screen includes <b>colony</b> <b>lift</b> onto a nylon membrane and subsequent lysis of NiR-expressing colonies {{in the presence of}} Cu 2 + ions for copper incorporation into intracellularly expressed NiR. Addition of a chromogenic substrate, 3, 3 ′-diaminobenzidine (DAB), results in deposition of red, insoluble color at the site of oxidation by functional NiR. Twenty-thousand random variants of NiR were screened for improved function with DAB as a reductant, and five variants were identified. These variants were shuffled and screened, yielding two double variants. An analog of the DAB substrate, o-dianisidine, which is oxidized to a water-soluble product was used for functional characterization. The double variant M 150 L/F 312 C was most proficient at o-dianisidine oxidation with dioxygen as the electron acceptor (5. 5 X wt), and the M 150 L single variant was most proficient at o-dianisidine oxidation with nitrite as the electron acceptor (8. 5 X wt). The library generation and screening method can be employed for evolving new reductase functions in NiR and for screening of efficient folding of engineered NiRs...|$|E
40|$|Crigler–Najjar {{syndrome}} type I {{is characterized}} by unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia resulting from an autosomal recessive inherited deficiency of hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1 A 1 activity. The enzyme is essential for glucuronidation and biliary excretion of bilirubin, and its absence can be fatal. The Gunn rat is an excellent animal model of this disease, exhibiting a single guanosine (G) base deletion within the UGT 1 A 1 gene. The defect results in a frameshift and a premature stop codon, absence of enzyme activity, and hyperbilirubinemia. Here, we show permanent correction of the UGT 1 A 1 genetic defect in Gunn rat liver with site-specific replacement of the absent G residue at nucleotide 1206 by using an RNA/DNA oligonucleotide designed to promote endogenous repair of genomic DNA. The chimeric oligonucleotide was either complexed with polyethylenimine or encapsulated in anionic liposomes, administered i. v., and targeted to the hepatocyte via the asialoglycoprotein receptor. G insertion was determined by PCR amplification, <b>colony</b> <b>lift</b> hybridizations, restriction endonuclease digestion, and DNA sequencing, and confirmed by genomic Southern blot analysis. DNA repair was specific, efficient, stable throughout the 6 -month observation period, and associated with reduction of serum bilirubin levels. Our results indicate that correction of the UGT 1 A 1 genetic lesion in the Gunn rat restores enzyme expression and bilirubin conjugating activity, with consequent improvement in the metabolic abnormality...|$|E
40|$|Here we {{demonstrate}} how our lab freezes HuES {{human embryonic stem}} cell lines. A healthy, exponentially expanding culture is washed with PBS to remove residual media that could otherwise quench the Trypsin reaction. Warmed 0. 05 % Trypsin-EDTA is then added to cover the cells, and the plate allowed to incubate for up to 5 mins at room temperature. During this time cells can be observed rounding, and <b>colonies</b> <b>lifting</b> off the plate surface. Gentle repeated pipetting will remove cells and colonies from the plate surface. Trypsinized cells are placed in a standard conical tube containing pre-warmed hES cell media to quench remaining trypsin, and then spun. Cells are resuspended growth media at a concentration of approximately one million cells in one mL of media, a concentration such that one frozen aliquot is sufficient to resurrect a culture on a 10 cm plate. After cells are adequately resuspended, ice cold freezing media is added at equal volume. Cell suspensions are mixed thoroughly, aliquoted into freezing vials, and allowed to slowly freeze to - 80 C over 24 hours.

40|$|Vibrio vulnificus is a {{potentially}} lethal human pathogen {{capable of producing}} septicemia in susceptible persons. Disease is almost always associated with consumption of seafood, particularly raw oysters, or with exposure of wounds to seawater. An oligonucleotide DNA probe (V. vulnificus alkaline phosphatase-labeled DNA probe [VVAP]), previously shown to be highly specific for V. vulnificus, was used to enumerate this species in environmental samples collected from the Chesapeake Bay between April 1991 and December 1992. Total aerobic, heterotrophic, culturable bacteria were enumerated by plate counts on nonselective medium. The number of V. vulnificus organisms was determined by <b>colony</b> <b>lifts</b> of spread plates for subsequent hybridization with VVAP. V. vulnificus was not detected in any samples collected during February and March (water temperature of 8 degrees C), with concentrations ranging from 3. 0 x 10 (1) to 2. 1 x 10 (2) /ml (ca. 8 % of the total culturable heterotrophic bacteria). In a multiple regression analysis, increased V. vulnificus concentrations were correlated with lower salinities and with isolation from samples collected closer to the bottom. Isolation from oysters was demonstrable when water temperatures were 7. 6 degrees C, with concentrations ranging from 1. 0 x 10 (3) to 4. 7 x 10 (4) /g (ca. 12 % of total culturable bacteria). In samples collected in May and July, V. vulnificus was identified in seven of seven plankton samples and four of nine sediment samples. Our data demonstrate that V. vulnificus is a widespread and {{important component of the}} bacterial population of the Chesapeake Bay, with counts that are comparable to those reported from the Gulf of Mexico...|$|R
40|$|Recent Vibrio parahaemolyticus {{outbreaks}} {{associated with}} consumption of raw shellfish in the United States {{focused attention on}} the occurrence of this organism in shellfish. From March 1999 through September 2000, paired oyster samples were collected biweekly from two shellfish-growing areas in Mobile Bay, Ala. The presence and densities of V. parahaemolyticus were determined by using DNA probes targeting the thermolabile hemolysin (tlh) and thermostable direct hemolysin (tdh) genes for confirmation of total and pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus, respectively. V. parahaemolyticus was detected in all samples with densities ranging from < 10 to 12, 000 g− 1. Higher V. parahaemolyticus densities were associated with higher water temperatures. Pathogenic strains were detected in 34 (21. 8 %) of 156 samples by direct plating or enrichment. Forty-six of 6, 018 and 31 of 6, 992 V. parahaemolyticus isolates from enrichments and direct plates, respectively, hybridized with the tdh probe. There was an apparent inverse relationship between water temperature and the prevalence of pathogenic strains. Pathogenic strains were of diverse serotypes, and 97 % produced urease and possessed a tdh-related hemolysin (trh) gene. The O 3 :K 6 serotype associated with pandemic spread and recent outbreaks in the United States was not detected. The efficient screening of numerous isolates by <b>colony</b> <b>lift</b> and DNA probe procedures {{may account for the}} higher prevalence of samples with tdh+ V. parahaemolyticus than previously reported...|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of sites resulting in cross-contamination of poultry flocks in the abattoir and {{determination of the}} survival and persistence of campylobacters at these sites are essential {{for the development of}} intervention strategies aimed at reducing the microbial burden on poultry at retail. A novel molecule-based method, using strain- and genus-specific oligonucleotide probes, was developed to detect and enumerate specific campylobacter strains in mixed populations. Strain-specific oligonucleotide probes were designed for the short variable regions (SVR) of the flaA gene in individual Campylobacter jejuni strains. A 16 S rRNA Campylobacter genus-specific probe was also used. Both types of probes were used to investigate populations of campylobacters by <b>colony</b> <b>lift</b> hybridization. The specificity and proof of principle of the method were tested using strains with closely related SVR sequences and mixtures of these strains. Colony lifts of campylobacters were hybridized sequentially with up to two labeled strain-specific probes, followed by the generic 16 S rRNA probe. SVR probes were highly specific, differentiating down to 1 nucleotide in the target sequence, and were sufficiently sensitive to detect colonies of a single strain in a mixed population. The 16 S rRNA probe detected all Campylobacter spp. tested but not closely related species, such as Arcobacter skirrowi and Helicobacter pullorum. Preliminary field studies demonstrated the application of this technique to target strains isolated from poultry transport crate wash tank water. This method is quantitative, sensitive, and highly specific and allows the identification and enumeration of selected strains among all of the campylobacters in environmental samples...|$|E
40|$|A species-specific RNA colony blot {{hybridization}} {{protocol was}} developed for enumeration of culturable Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio mimicus bacteria in environmental water samples. Bacterial colonies on selective or nonselective plates were lysed by sodium dodecyl sulfate, and the lysates were immobilized on nylon membranes. A fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probe targeting a phylogenetic signature sequence of 16 S rRNA of V. cholerae and V. mimicus was hybridized to rRNA molecules immobilized on the nylon <b>colony</b> <b>lift</b> blots. The protocol produced strong positive signals for all colonies of the 15 diverse V. cholerae-V. mimicus strains tested, indicating 100 % sensitivity of the probe for the targeted species. For visible colonies of 10 nontarget species, the specificity of the probe was calculated to be 90 % because of a weak positive signal produced by Grimontia (Vibrio) hollisae, a marine bacterium. When both the sensitivity and specificity of the assay were evaluated using lake water samples amended with a bioluminescent V. cholerae strain, no false-negative or false-positive results were found, indicating 100 % sensitivity and specificity for culturable bacterial populations in freshwater samples when G. hollisae was not present. When the protocol was applied to laboratory microcosms containing V. cholerae attached to live copepods, copepods were found to carry approximately 10, 000 to 50, 000 CFU of V. cholerae per copepod. The protocol was also used to analyze pond water samples collected {{in an area of}} cholera endemicity in Bangladesh over a 9 -month period. Water samples collected from six ponds demonstrated a peak in abundance of total culturable V. cholerae bacteria 1 to 2 months prior to observed increases in pathogenic V. cholerae and in clinical cases recorded by the area health clinic. The method provides a highly specific and sensitive tool for monitoring the dynamics of V. cholerae in the environment. The RNA blot hybridization protocol can also be applied to detection of other gram-negative bacteria for taxon-specific enumeration...|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a simple method to generate and expand multipotent, self-renewing pre-rosette neural stem cells from both human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs) without utilizing embryoid body formation, manual selection techniques, or complex combinations of small molecules. Human ESC and iPSC <b>colonies</b> were <b>lifted</b> and placed in a neural stem cell medium containing high concentrations of EGF and FGF- 2. Cell aggregates (termed EZ spheres) could be expanded for long periods using a chopping method that maintained cell-cell contact. Early passage EZ spheres rapidly down-regulated OCT 4 and up-regulated SOX 2 and nestin expression. They retained the potential to form neural rosettes and consistently differentiated into a range of central and peripheral neural lineages. Thus, they represent a very early neural stem cell with greater differentiation flexibility than other previously described methods. As such, they will be useful for the rapidly expanding field of neurological development and disease modeling, high-content screening, and regenerative therapies based on pluripotent stem cell technology. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyProfound {{perturbation}} of epithelial {{structure is}} a characteristic {{feature of the}} immunopatholoical response to bacterial antigens considered to be central in the pathogenesis of the destructive lesion of periodontitis. The pathological basis for the disturbance of epithelial structure is not understood. It was demonstrated that the structural integrity and functional differentiation of the lining epithelium is compromised in relation to inflammatory changes associated with destructive periodontitis. In the pathological lining epithelium of the periodontal pocket there was a marked reduction of epithelial cadherin important in intercellular adhesion, of involucrin, a marker of terminal differentiation, and of the gap junction connexions that form intercellular communication channels. These changes were associated with alterations of filamentous actin expression, collectively indicating profound perturbation of epithelial structure. The data reported support the concept that {{the ability of the}} pathological lining epithelium to function as an effective barrier against the ingress of microbial products into the tissues is severely compromised (Ye et al., 2000). In addition, a recent study (Ye et al., 2003) by Western analysis of serum IgG from all 22 patients with chronic periodontitis tested indicated recognition of multiple epithelial components in individual patterns. In contrast, subjects with a healthy periodontium displayed only trace recognition of epithelial antigens. Levels of epithelial-reactive antibodies were significantly correlated with attachment loss as an indication of disease activity. To investigate a possible relationship between the bacterial flora adjacent to the diseased sites and the presence of epithelial-reactive antibodies, subgingival plague samples were taken from deep periodontal pockets and cultured anaerobically. Gram positive bacteria containing antigens potentially cross-reactive with epithelial cells were reproducibly isolated by probing membrane <b>colony</b> <b>lifts</b> with affinity-isolated (epitheial-specific) antibodies. The bacteria were identified as streptococci (S. mitis, S. constellatus and two S. intermedius strains) and Actinomyces (A. georgiae, and A. sp. oral clone) by 16 S rDNA sequence homology. Recognition by affinity-isolated antibodies of antigens from the captured organisms was confirmed by Western analysis. Conversely, absorption of affinity-isolated antibodies with bacterial species specifically reduced subsequent recognition of epithelial antigens. To identify the auto-antigens, a human keratinocyte cDNA expression library in Lambda phage was probed using a pooled sera. Groups of responders were detected for CD 24 (a recently described adhesion molecule also known as P-selectin ligand), antioxidant protein 2 (a newly recognised member of the thiol-dependment anti-oxidant proteins), lavtate dehydrogenase A, the transcription factor NFAT 5, and for three genes encoding novel proteins. Six identified bacteria, especially S intermedius were demonstrated to absorb antibodies reaching with identified auto-antigens in patterns varying between individuals. This evidence indicated that during the course of periodontits, subjects develop increased levels of antibodies to common oral bacteria amongst which are included tissue cross-reactive antigens. Periodontitis could therefore present a risk for the subsequent initiation or exacerbation of a broad spectrum of disease processes including autoimmune, inflammatory, proliferative and degenerative disorders...|$|R

40|$|Portugal’s {{involvement}} in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars resulted in substantial economic, political and social change revealing interconnections between state and economy {{that have not been}} acknowledged fully within the existing literature. On the one hand, economic and political change was precipitated by the flight of Dom João, the removal of the court to Rio de Janeiro, and the appointment of a regency council in Lisbon: events that were the result of much more than the mere confluence of external drivers and internal pressures in Europe, however complex and compelling they may have been at the time. Although governance in Portugal had been handed over to the regency council strict limitations were imposed on its autonomy. Once Lisbon was occupied, and French military government imposed on Portugal, her continued role as entrepôt, linking the South Atlantic economy to that of Europe, could not be guaranteed. Brazil’s ports were therefore opened to foreign vessels and restrictions on agriculture, manufacture and inter-regional trade in the <b>colonies</b> were <b>lifted</b> presaging a transition from neo-mercantilism to proto-industrialised capitalism. The meanings of this dislocation of political power and the shift of government from metropolis to colony were complex, not least in relation to the location and limits of absolutist authority. The immediate results of which were a series of popular insurrections in Portugal, a swift response by the French military government and conservative reaction by Portuguese élites, leading to widespread popular resistance in 1808 and 1809 and, subsequently, Portugal’s wholesale {{involvement in}} the Peninsular War with severe and deleterious effects on the Portuguese population and economy. Ultimately, these events would lead to demands for constitutional reform and civil war but not, as yet, the dismantling of mercantilism, the abolition of slavery or the separation of Portugal and Brazil as independent states. Ironically, the forces for change in this regard, in the years immediately following the Napoleonic Wars, would appear stronger in the metropolis and weaker in its former colony...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the extent}} of {{microbial}} transport, distribution and activity in the subsurface is paramount for effective in-situ bioremediation. In one study, we investigated the impact a substrate pulse has on the movement of inoculated or indigenous bacteria through saturated porous media. In another study, we developed a method to visualize the distribution of bacteria on soil surfaces. The elution of either inoculated or indigenous bacteria was monitored from model (homogenous) sand or natural (heterogenous) soil column systems. Sand columns receiving salicylate resulted in enhanced elution of inoculated P. putida. However, the salicylate pulse {{did not result in}} enhanced elution of P. putida from a natural system. For natural heterogenous systems, the salicylate pulse significantly affected the elution of certain indigenous bacteria. Specifically, more heterotrophs were eluted from soil columns receiving salicylate than from those that did not for both loamy sand soils tested. On the other hand, there were consistently fewer salicylate-degrading cells eluted in the presence of salicylate from one of the two soils tested. These data suggest that bacterial transport is a function of both the porous medium and the microbial population(s) under investigation. In the second study, an agar lift-DNA/DNA hybridization technique was developed to visualize the distribution of eubacteria on soil surfaces. Briefly, a single layer of soil was lifted from the surface of soil microcosms onto agar slabs and allowed to incubate. Bacterial <b>colonies</b> were <b>lifted</b> from the agar slabs onto membranes. The location of individual colonies was detected on the membranes by hybridization with a probe complementary to a conserved region of the eubacterial genome. This method was able to detect active microorganisms on different soil surfaces. The probe signal correlated well with the number of metabolically active microorganisms found in soils amended with a carbon source. This technique also allowed for visualization of localized microbial activity. A combined approach utilizing both soil column studies and the agar-lift technique should allow researchers to better elucidate microbial transport, distribution and activity in subsurface environments...|$|R
40|$|Contamination {{of retail}} poultry by Campylobacter spp. is a {{significant}} source of human diarrheal disease. We have developed a colony-lift immunoassay (CLI) for the detection of Campylobacter jejuni, C. coli, and C. lari isolated from such sources and grown on selective agar medium or on filter membranes. This technique has been successfully utilized to quantify Campylobacter colonies within 18 to 28 h after sampling. Hydrophobic, high-protein-binding membranes were prewet with methanol and used to imprint bacterial cells from the agar or filter membrane, while leaving colonies intact and viable. The membranes were air dried, peroxidase neutralized, blocked with bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, and hybridized for 5 min with an affinity-purified, horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-Campylobacter antibody preparation (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories). The membranes were washed briefly, exposed to a 3,' 5, 5 '-tetramethylbenzidine membrane substrate, rinsed in deionized water, and allowed to dry. <b>Lifted</b> <b>colonies</b> of Campylobacter were identified by a blue color reaction on the membrane. Replicas of the membranes were made by marking the location of the Campylobacter colonies on clear transparencies, which were subsequently utilized to locate the original colony on the filter membrane or agar plate. The specificity of this antibody preparation has been evaluated against a wide range of Campylobacter spp., including American Type Culture Collection type and references strains, retail poultry isolates, and isolates obtained from cloacal swabs of live commercial broiler chickens. Specificity against numerous non-Campylobacter spp. obtained from the same sources was also evaluated. The CLI provided a rapid and simple means for detection and enumeration of enteropathogenic Campylobacter organisms. We have successfully combined this CLI procedure with methods recently developed in our laboratories for retail meat and poultry sampling. Potentially, broader applications for use of this technique include detection and enumeration of campylobacters from clinical, veterinary, and environmental samples...|$|R
40|$|Blast colonies were {{developed}} by rIL- 3 from the spleen cells of mice pretreated with 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) in the methylcellulose cultures. When such IL- 3 -induced blast <b>colonies</b> were individually <b>lifted</b> up and recultured {{in the presence of}} rIL- 3 and recombinant erythropoietin (rEpo), a variety of hematopoietic colonies developed from every single colony, including neutrophils, macrophages, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, mast cells, and erythroblasts. The results indicated that IL- 3 -induced blast colonies consisted of multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cells. By culturing individual IL- 3 -induced blast colonies in the presence of rIL- 2 and irradiated peritoneal macrophages, on the other hand, the proliferation of homogeneous lymphoid cells was observed in 5 of 24 wells, each of which received a single blast colony. Morphologically, they were typical large granular lymphocytes (LGL), and thus it was indicated that LGL could be differentiated directly from the hematopoietic progenitor cells utterly in vitro by rIL- 2 and accessory macrophages. From one of these culture wells, a continuous LGL line, IL 3 B 1, was successfully obtained. The proliferation of IL 3 B 1 was dependent on IL- 2 in the presence of accessory macrophages, but they no longer responded to IL- 3, nor to another T cell growth factor, IL- 4. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that the phenotype of IL 3 B 1 was Thy- 1 +,T 3 +,L 3 T 4 -,Lyt- 2 -,T 200 + Asialo GM 1 +, whereas that of original IL- 3 -induced blast cells was Thy- 1 +,T 3 -,L 3 T 4 -,Lyt- 2 -,B 220 -. The results suggested that the expression of T 3 molecules was induced in the process of LGL differentiation from the hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro. Conforming to this, it was revealed that both gamma and beta chain genes of the TCR were rearranged in IL 3 B 1. Northern blot analysis indicated that IL 3 B 1 had abundant mRNA for gamma chain, while mRNA for beta chain was rather faint. Functionally, IL 3 B 1 exhibited typical NK-patterned cytotoxic activity against a panel of tumor cell targets. In addition, they showed significant cytotoxic activity against normal bone marrow cells, as well as various factor-dependent myelogenous progenitor cell lines, all of which were resistant to endogenous NK activity of the fresh spleen cells. These results indicated that at least a set of T 3 + LGL with rearranged TCR genes could be directly differentiated from isolated hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro. Results also suggested that such a prethymically differentiated subset of T-lineage lymphocytes, namely T 3 + double-negative LGL, had particular cytotoxic activity in addition to conventional NK activity, which might well contribute to feedback regulation of hematopoiesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationships}} among chick feeding, size {{and type of}} prey item, and foraging {{time away from the}} brood have not been well studied in seabirds. This study investigated spatial and temporal patterns of foraging and chick-provisioning among 23 radio-tagged male common terns nesting at Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario during 1991 and 1992. Telemetry data were collected concurrently with behavioural observations from an elevated blind. Terns fitted with transmitters did not differ from controls with respect to either brood attendance, patterns of chick mortality, species and size distributions of prey delivered to offspring, or chick-provisioning rates. There was a clear separation of parental roles: males were primarily responsible for feeding chicks while females allocated more time to brood attendance. The prey species most commonly delivered to chicks by adults were rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) and alewife (A/osa pseudoharengus), followed in importance by larval fish, emerald shiner (Notropis antherinoides), salmonids, and fathead minnows (Pimepha/es prome/as). The relative proportions of various fish speCies delivered to chicks by males differed over the course of each breeding season, and there was also much variability in species composition of prey between years. Sizes of prey delivered to chicks also differed between sampling periods. The modal size of fish brought to chicks during Peak 1991 was 1. 5 bill lengths, while the majority of prey in Late 1991 were small larval fish. The reverse trend occurred in 1992 when small fish were delivered to chicks predominantly during the Peak nesting period. During periods when predominantly small fish were delivered to chicks, the foraging activity of radio-tagged males was concentrated within a two kilometer radius of the colony. The observed variation in prey composition and foraging locations during the study likely reflects temporal variation in the availability of prey {{in the vicinity of the}} colony. Males delivered fish to chicks at a constant rate, while females 4 increased their feeding frequency over the first six to ten brood days. The mean length of fish delivered to chicks by adults increased significantly with increasing chick age. As a group, within each nesting period, transmittered males either foraged predominantly in the same directional bearing (north during Peak 1991, south during Late 1992), or concentrated foraging activity in the immediate vicinity of the colony (Late 1991, Peak 1992). However, individual radio-tagged males exhibited unique and predictable foraging patterns, often favouring specific locations within these areas and differing in their secondary foraging patterns. Overall, the Lake Ontario shoreline between NCB Bay" (3. 5 km south of <b>colony)</b> and the <b>lift</b> bridge canal (4 km north of colony) was the foraging area used most frequently by radiotagged males during the chick-rearing period. Foraging patterns of transmittered males at Windermere Basin are similar to patterns of peak-nesting common terns, but differ from those of late-nesters, at a nearby colony (Port Colborne, Lake Erie). Differences between the foraging patterns of late-nesting terns at these colonies likely reflect differences in annual patterns of fish availability between the two locations. No relationship was found between foraging proficiency of adults and survival of offspring. Stochastic factors, such as predation by black-crowned nightherons (Nycticorax nycticorax) and adverse weather conditions during the early stages of chick rearing, may be more important determinants of common tern breeding success than parental quality or fish availability...|$|R
