5000|$|The IBM 024 Card Punch and IBM 026 Printing Card Punch [...] were {{announced}} in 1949. They were almost identical, {{with the exception}} of the printing mechanism. The heart of the 024 and 026 keypunches was a set of twelve precision punches, one per <b>card</b> <b>row,</b> each with an actuator of relatively high power. Punch cards were stepped across the punch one column at a time, and the appropriate punches were activated to create the holes, resulting in a distinctive [...] "chunk, chunk" [...] sound as columns were punched. Both machines could process 51-, 60-, 66-, and 80-column cards.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: An 80-column punched <b>card.</b> <b>Rows</b> 0 to 9 are labeled. The 12 row, on top, has one {{punch in}} column 7. The 11 row, below {{it is not}} punched on this card. As cards passed through a read station, usually 9-edge (bottom edge) first, wire brushes, one for each column, would make contact through the holes.|$|R
5000|$|The cards {{available}} for {{building in the}} foundations should come from Row 1 (also known as the [...] "Privy Council") only. Furthermore, <b>cards</b> in <b>Row</b> 1 can be built down by alternating colors. Available for building in Row 1 are the top cards of the piles in Row 1 (initially containing only one card per pile) and the <b>cards</b> from <b>Row</b> 2. Only one card can be moved at a time.|$|R
5000|$|If the played card {{is lower}} than all the latest cards present on the four rows, the player must choose a row and gather the <b>cards</b> on that <b>row</b> (usually the row with the fewest cattle heads), leaving only the played <b>card</b> on the <b>row.</b>|$|R
50|$|Turn {{over the}} next <b>card</b> in the <b>row.</b>|$|R
50|$|A fifty is a run {{similar to}} a twenty however it is a run of four <b>cards</b> in a <b>row.</b> If {{you happen to have}} 5 or 6 <b>cards</b> in a <b>row</b> it is still just a fifty and the extra cards are in no way {{significant}} when comparing to other runs.|$|R
5000|$|If {{playing with}} three players, one color of cards {{is removed from}} the deck before play begins. Each player then {{receives}} a card of a color, with no two players receiving the same color. The remaining cards are shuffled together, and a [...] "last round" [...] card is then placed fifteen cards {{from the bottom of the}} shuffled stack. The game plays out on a number of (initially empty) <b>card</b> <b>rows</b> equal to the number of players in the game. Coloretto provides [...] "row markers" [...] to easily track the rows, and to remind players when rows have been taken.|$|R
50|$|The top <b>card</b> of each <b>row</b> (the <b>cards</b> {{that are}} exposed) is {{available}} for play either on the foundations or on any other row. The foundations are built up to kings by suit. <b>Cards</b> in the <b>rows</b> are built down in sequence regardless of suit. Once a row becomes empty, it can be filled by any card.|$|R
2500|$|... 1- The {{player has}} five <b>cards</b> in a <b>row</b> {{in the same}} suit, {{according}} to Global cards sorting.|$|R
5000|$|This is {{the same}} as in the {{previous}} seasons, but only one family can play with 16 Crazy Cash Cards in a 4x4 grid. Nine of the cards have cash, six of them have Go To Jail, and the last one has Win. Each time they get a Cash <b>Card</b> from each <b>row,</b> they will earn the corresponding amount on the card and {{move on to the next}} one. If a team gets a Go To Jail <b>Card</b> (<b>rows</b> two through four), the game is over, but they get to keep all the money they've earned along with the prizes from earlier. When that happens, Newton will reveal where in the top row the car is. However, if they get to the top row and successfully find the Win Card (the screen displays [...] "WIN!" [...] and [...] "GO TO JAIL" [...] on slots), they'll earn a Jeep Patriot in Seasons 3 & 4, and a Ford Escape in Season 5, along with the prizes and the money they've accumulated.|$|R
5000|$|First three cards, a 2, a 3, and a 4, {{are placed}} vertically. Then, beside {{each of the}} three <b>cards</b> is a <b>row</b> of seven <b>cards.</b> The first <b>card</b> in each <b>row</b> shows that it is the row for all other cards with the same rank. The first row is known as the [...] "2s' row," [...] the second row the [...] "3s' row," [...] and the third row the [...] "4s' row." ...|$|R
50|$|Brady's first {{products}} were promotional calendars, painted signs and {{point of purchase}} displays. The company survived the Great Depression by producing {{hundreds of millions of}} push cards: small paperboard <b>cards</b> with <b>rows</b> of perforated circles concealing numbers, which fitted into Brady's established business of printing, die cutting and laminating.|$|R
50|$|First player {{starts out}} by laying out a <b>card</b> face up (<b>row</b> 1). Below that card, place another face down {{followed}} by one face up {{right next to}} it (row 2). Below that row, place 1st and 2nd card face down and 3rd <b>card</b> face up (<b>row</b> 3). Below that row, place the 1st, 2nd and 3rd card face down, 4th <b>card</b> face up (<b>row</b> 4). This is laid out on players right side. Below 4th row, count out 12 cards face down making a stack with the 13th card face up. Remaining cards, face down in a stack {{to the left of}} the stack of the 13 (make sure there is a big space (two hands width in between for a discard pile, cards in discard pile are face up)).|$|R
50|$|Drawing a {{card and}} place it {{onto one of the}} (remaining) rows, unless this would be the fourth <b>card</b> in that <b>row.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Two Decks: For a {{much longer}} game, shuffle {{together}} two 52-card decks and lay them out in 8 <b>rows</b> of 13 <b>cards</b> (9 <b>rows</b> of 12 <b>cards</b> if using jokers). Pairs must be identical (same rank and same suit, so the 10 of clubs would have to match the other 10 of clubs).|$|R
50|$|If {{a couple}} {{bet on the}} whole lot the wrong way {{during the first three}} cards, that card would be put on the row above and the {{additional}} £500 would be added on. If there was a pair revealed in the Cash Cards, the couple didn't lose any money, they moved on to the next card. If the last two <b>cards</b> on a <b>row</b> were a pair, the second card would be used as the base <b>card</b> for the <b>row</b> above.|$|R
50|$|First, {{the player}} deals eleven {{overlapping}} <b>cards</b> in a <b>row.</b> These <b>cards</b> form the reserve or terrace. After leaving a space below the terrace for the foundations, the player lays four <b>cards</b> in a <b>row.</b> The player then chooses {{which of these}} four cards starts the first foundation. The player places the chosen card on the foundation row, immediately fills the gap it left with a new card from the stock. The player adds five new cards beside these four to form the tableau.|$|R
5000|$|A twenty is a run {{of three}} <b>cards</b> in a <b>row</b> of the same suit. (e.g. 6, 7, 8 of hearts or 9, 10, J of clubs) ...|$|R
50|$|The rows are continuous. The last <b>card</b> of one <b>row</b> is {{connected}} to the first card of the next. So goes with the last card of the sixth row to the first card of the first row. Thus, a gap on the extreme left of a row can be filled with a card with the same suit and a rank lower than the card on the gap's right or a card with the same suit and a rank higher than the last <b>card</b> of the <b>row</b> above, and vice versa.|$|R
50|$|All rows {{are laid}} out {{in a way that they}} cover half of the <b>cards</b> in the <b>row</b> {{immediately}} above, so that the end result resembles a tree, thus the name.|$|R
5000|$|If a run has 7 clean <b>cards</b> in a <b>row</b> plus a deuce, it {{is worth}} 150 points, but this rule is valid only {{for one of the}} eight Italian [...] "Burraco Federations".|$|R
5000|$|Straight Flush: Any {{five or more}} <b>cards</b> in a <b>row</b> of {{the same}} suit. Same rules apply as a {{straight}}. A straight flush can be played on any tricks except for a higher straight flush straight.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the card}} is tilted at an angle, the {{holographic}} word “POLICE” will appear below the officer’s photograph, {{while on the}} right of the <b>card,</b> a vertical <b>row</b> of 5 holographic police crests will be visible.Read more at ...|$|R
50|$|While {{the first}} <b>card</b> in each <b>row</b> {{is already a}} {{foundation}} in itself {{and it can be}} built on, once a card ends up in its proper row no matter where in the row, it becomes a foundation itself.|$|R
5000|$|Four or {{more players}} use two {{standard}} 52-card decks plus 2 or 4 Jokers [...] Each player is dealt 6 cards face {{down from the}} deck, the remainder is placed face down and the top card is turned up to start the discard pile beside it. Players arrange their 6 <b>cards</b> in <b>rows</b> {{in front of them}} and turn 2 of these cards face up. This arrangement is maintained throughout the game and players always have 6 cards in front of them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was really}} {{interested}} in his stuff. I WAS talking to him before I saw {{his name on the}} <b>card</b> beside the <b>row</b> of microscopes. Then, naturally, I went on talking. He--he has rather a poor opinion of his contemporaries. Of course, he had no idea who I was." ...|$|R

50|$|After {{the stock}} has run out, one redeal is allowed. To do this, the columns are {{gathered}} left to right, and put over each other face up. The stock is turned face down {{and the process of}} dealing eight <b>cards</b> in a <b>row</b> and moving <b>cards</b> to the foundations is repeated.|$|R
50|$|At {{the second}} part of game play, <b>cards</b> from both <b>rows</b> can be placed on the {{foundations}} as well as around the piles at both rows, building either up or down regardless of suit at the piles. Building is also continuous as a king can be placed over an ace and vice versa.|$|R
5000|$|The Powers/Remington Rand {{card format}} was {{initially}} {{the same as}} Hollerith's; 45 columns and round holes. In 1930, Remington Rand leap-frogged IBM's 80 column format from 1928 by coding two characters {{in each of the}} 45 columns - producing what is now commonly called the 90-column card. [...] There are two sets of six <b>rows</b> across each <b>card.</b> The <b>rows</b> in each set are labeled 0, 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, 7/8 and 9. The even numbers in a pair are formed by combining that punch with a 9 punch. Alphabetic and special characters use 3 or more punches ...|$|R
50|$|During this time, Khalfan {{accumulated}} 2 red <b>cards</b> in a <b>row</b> within 2 {{games in}} the Qatar Stars League, both in the 89th minute for physical altercations with other players. Al Sadd lost both of the matches {{in which he was}} red carded. However, he did not receive any red cards in international competitions.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the game, cards give points {{according}} to their value, but <b>cards</b> in a <b>row</b> only count as a single card with the lowest value (e.g. A run of 30, 29, 28, 27 is only worth 27 points.) Chips are worth one negative point each. The player(s) with the lowest number of points win the game.|$|R
50|$|From a standard, shuffled deck of 52 cards, {{each player}} is dealt three face-down <b>cards</b> in a <b>row.</b> Players {{are not allowed}} to see or change these cards. On top of the face-down cards, they are dealt the same number of face-up cards. Three cards are again dealt to each player (face down), and this becomes the player's hand.|$|R
50|$|Aces play {{no part in}} this game. Any ace that is in {{the reserve}} is {{immediately}} discarded. But an ace in any of the rows must be replaced by any applicable <b>card</b> for that <b>row.</b> So in order to discard an ace from the 2s' row, for example, a 2 must be available to replace it.|$|R
