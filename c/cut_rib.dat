50|$|In inner area of {{the church}} there are oval {{perimeter}} chapels which are connected with central cylinder space by narrower ogive arches. The central area which is covered by vault with lunettes, is carried by ten pillars. In first floor there are tribunes corresponding to chapels in the basement. Second floor is decorated with the gallery counting ten pieces of art which are arranged round the heel of the vault. Stucco decoration is limited to motives of intersecting and <b>cut</b> <b>rib</b> arches similar to Gothic vaults. As on the other Santini's buildings, even here light is used to build inner space. This approach is based on baroque interpretation of light {{as a sign of}} god's presence. Some call this 'sacral light'.The illumination of church's interior creates unique paradox. Meanwhile, central area is illuminated only indirectly the side walkway parts of the church are awash with light. This light permeates into central {{area of the}} church by ogive arches placed in places where should stand the bearing pillars. The stucco decoration underlines this paradox by creating relation between wall and arch belonging to that particular wall. This makes a feeling that the wall is only a shell and the whole building is carried by light itself. The entire church is then perceived also as a reliquary in where the relic of tongue of Saint John Nepomuk dwells.|$|E

40|$|The {{essential}} {{amino acid}} composition of carcasses from South African Mutton Merino ram lambs fed a standard diet was investigated. Twenty lambs were randomly allocated to four pre-assigned average slaughter weights (30, 35, 40 and 45 kg live weight). The chemical composition (moisture, fat, protein and {{essential amino acid}}s) of the carcass, three <b>rib</b> <b>cut,</b> M. longissimus dorsi, M. infraspinatus flexor, and M. biceps femoris was determined. The moisture and fat percentage of the three <b>rib</b> <b>cut</b> revealed the highest correlation when {{compared to that of}} the carcass. Non-significant correlations (p > 0. 05) occurred between the carcass protein and the protein percentage of the three <b>rib</b> <b>cut</b> and each of the muscles. Low coefficients of determination (r 2) were obtained when prediction equations for individual essential amino acid concentration in the carcass from the three <b>rib</b> <b>cut</b> or muscles as well as the protein percentage of the carcass were formulated. The essential amino acid composition of the carcass, three <b>rib</b> <b>cut</b> and muscles remained similar regardless of slaughter weight. Isoleucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine and valine concentrations were significantly different (p < 0. 05) either in the three <b>rib</b> <b>cut</b> or at least in one of the muscles when compared to the carcass. The carcass essential amino acid composition (g AA / 100 g protein) was as follows: 6. 94 arginine; 2. 61 histidine; 3. 19 isoleucine; 7. 19 leucine; 7. 03 lysine; 2. 08 methionine; 4. 15 phenylalanine; 3. 79 threonine and 4. 28 valine.

40|$|Eleven Angus, 12 Friesian and 12 Hereford steers {{were used}} to {{investigate}} the degree of accuracy and usefulness of primal cut tissues in predicting side composition. The criteria used for evaluating the cuts were: (a) {{standard error of estimate}} of the equation, (b) homogeneity of ‘b’ values among breeds, (c) appreciable bone content in cut to allow the prediction of side bone, and (d) the absence of major difficulties in the replication and dissection of cuts. Simple and multiple regression analyses showed that the most accurate predictors of carcass composition, in descending order, with standard errors of estimate of muscle, fat and bone percentages respectively, were: hindquarter plus <b>rib</b> <b>cut</b> (0. 37 %, 0. 47 %, 0. 30 %); hindquarter (0. 73 %, 0. 87 %, 0. 49 %); loin plus <b>rib</b> <b>cut</b> (0. 84 %, 0. 88 %, 0. 48 %); <b>rib</b> <b>cut</b> (1. 13 %, 1. 26 %, 0. 59 %); loin (1. 24 %, 1. 21 %, 0. 72 %). The most useful of four easily obtained carcass variables in improving the prediction accuracy of carcass components from multiple regression proved to be primal cut weight and fat thickness at the 12 th rib, particularly the former. Both significantly reduced the standard errors of estimate of muscle, fat or bone in equations based on loin, <b>rib</b> <b>cut</b> and loin plus <b>rib</b> <b>cut,</b> but not in equations based on hindquarter plus <b>rib</b> <b>cut</b> and hindquarter. Kidney plus pelvic fat weight was of limited value, resulting only in a slight improvement in the prediction of side bone percentage using the equations based on bone percentage of the hindquarter. Carcass weight was of equal value to primal cut weight in improving the prediction accuracy of multiple regression. Five sets of part-carcass prediction equations are given, providing a choice of prediction accuracy, labour expenditure and cost for research workers whose requirements and resources may vary...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to establish equations to estimate the empty body chemical composition of Nellore steers using the following indirect techniques: 1) physical composition of the 9 - 10 - 11 (th) rib cut;) physical composition of the 10 (th) rib cut; and 3) chemical composition of the 10 (th) <b>rib</b> <b>cut.</b> Thirty-one Nellore steers with weights ranging from 245 to 489 kg and ages from 20 to 29. 7 months at slaughter were utilized. The empty body chemical composition was established through samples collected after grinding all animal tissues. The equations using the percentage of dissectable fat in the 9 - 10 - 11 (th) <b>rib</b> <b>cut</b> shored a high precision for estimating the percentage of water (r(2) = 0. 91; Syx = 1. 168) and ether extract (r(2) = 0. 94; Syx = 1. 298) of the empty body; the same was observed when the percentage of dissectable fat in the 10 (th) <b>rib</b> <b>cut</b> was used (r(2) = 0. 82 and 0. 85; Syx = 1. 658 and 1. 942, respectively, for water and ether extract). The equations using the percentage of ether extract in the 10 (th) <b>rib</b> <b>cut</b> showed a high precision for estimating the percentage of water (r(2) = 0. 89; Syx = 1. 311) and the ether extract (r(2) = 0. 89; Syx = 1. 730) of the empty body, but there was no advantage over the physical composition of the 9 - 10 - 11 (th) and 10 (th) <b>rib</b> <b>cut.</b> Multiple regressions using carcass weight and the percentage of bones and kilograms of lean, fat, and bones dissectable in the 10 (th) <b>rib</b> <b>cut</b> improved the coefficients of determination for water and ether extract to 0. 87 and 0. 91.

40|$|The aims of {{the study}} were to {{determine}} the body composition of springbok, blesbok and impala and to compare the chemical composition (moisture, protein, fat, ash) of the 9 th- 10 th- 11 th <b>rib</b> <b>cut</b> samples with that of the carcass. The proportional distribution of protein in the carcass, external (heart, feet and skin) and internal offal (heart, heart fat, liver, lungs and trachea, kidneys, kidney fat, spleen, testis, gastro intestinal tract (GIT) fat, diaphragm, stomachs and intestines) was also determined. The physical composition of all three game species followed the same pattern when expressed as a percentage of empty body weight. Impala had a higher (P< 0. 05) proportional percent protein in the carcass compared to springbok or blesbok. Male springbok, blesbok and impala recorded a significantly lower fat content, but higher moisture content in the carcass and 9 th- 10 th- 11 th <b>rib</b> <b>cut</b> than the females. No significant correlation was evident between the chemical protein (on an as-is basis) content of the carcass and 9 th- 10 th- 11 th <b>rib</b> <b>cut</b> samples for any of the game species studied (springbok: r 2 =- 0. 06, blesbok: r 2 = 0. 44, impala: r 2 = 0. 26).
