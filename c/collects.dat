40|$|The {{efficiency}} of ten differently colored modified box traps for <b>collecting</b> tabanids was {{studied in the}} Monjoroš Forest in eastern Croatia. A total of 5, 436 specimens belonging to 16 species of tabanids grouped into six genera were <b>collected.</b> The genus Tabanus was the most represented with 98 % of all <b>collected</b> tabanids. Tabanus bromius comprised 90 % of tabanids <b>collected,</b> and was the most abundant species <b>collected</b> in all box traps. The majority of tabanids (74 %) were <b>collected</b> from black, brown, bordeaux, red, and blue traps (dark group), whereas 26 % were <b>collected</b> from green, light violet, white, orange, and yellow traps (light group). The black modified trap was the most successful and <b>collected</b> 20 % of all <b>collected</b> tabanids, whereas the yellow trap was the least effective with 1 %. The number of <b>collected</b> specimens of species T. bromius differed significantly between the dark and light group of traps.

5|$|The right heart <b>collects</b> deoxygenated {{blood from}} two large veins, the {{superior}} and inferior venae cavae. Blood <b>collects</b> {{in the right}} and left atrium continuously. The superior vena cava drains blood from above the diaphragm and empties into the upper back part of the right atrium. The inferior vena cava drains the blood from below the diaphragm and empties into the back part of the atrium below the opening for the superior vena cava. Immediately above and {{to the middle of the}} opening of the inferior vena cava is the opening of the thin-walled coronary sinus. Additionally, the coronary sinus returns deoxygenated blood from the myocardium to the right atrium. The blood <b>collects</b> in the right atrium. When the right atrium contracts, the blood is pumped through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. As the right ventricle contracts, the tricuspid valve closes and the blood is pumped into the pulmonary trunk through the pulmonary valve. The pulmonary trunk divides into pulmonary arteries and progressively smaller arteries throughout the lungs, until it reaches capillaries. As these pass by alveoli carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen. This happens through the passive process of diffusion.|$|E
