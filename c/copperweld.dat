2500|$|It is {{also our}} view that Lessig and later Ninth Circuit {{decisions}} refining and applying it are {{inconsistent with the}} policy of the Sherman Act. The purpose of the Act is not to protect businesses from the working of the market; it is to protect the public from the failure of the market. The law directs itself not against conduct which is competitive, even severely so, but against conduct which unfairly tends to destroy competition itself. It does so not out of solicitude for private concerns but out of concern for the public interest. Thus, this Court and other courts have been careful to avoid constructions of § 2 which might chill competition, rather than foster it. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish robust competition from conduct with long-term anticompetitive effects; moreover, single-firm activity is unlike concerted activity covered by § 1, which [...] "inherently is fraught with anticompetitive risk." [...] <b>Copperweld,</b> 467 U.S., at 767-769, 104 S.Ct., at 2739-2740. For these reasons, § 2 makes the conduct of a single firm unlawful only when it actually monopolizes or dangerously threatens to do so. Id., at 767, 104 S.Ct., at 2739. The concern that § 2 might be applied so as to further anticompetitive ends is plainly not met by inquir ing only whether the defendant has engaged in [...] "unfair" [...] or [...] "predatory" [...] tactics. Such conduct may be sufficient to prove the necessary intent to monopolize, which is something more than an intent to compete vigorously, but demonstrating the dangerous probability of monopolization in an attempt case also requires inquiry into the relevant product and geographic market and the defendant's economic power in that market.|$|E
50|$|Fushi <b>Copperweld,</b> Inc. (Simplified Chinese: 傅氏科普威) is a Sino-American {{company based}} in Beijing, China. It was formed from the {{acquisition}} of an American wire company, <b>Copperweld</b> Bimetallics LLC, by Chinese manufacturer Fushi International in October 2007. The combined company is the largest manufacturer and supplier of bimetallic electrical conductor products {{in the world by}} volume. Its main products are wire, stranded electrical cable, and busbar made from its <b>Copperweld</b> brand copper-clad steel ("CCS") or copper-clad aluminium ("CCA"). In addition to its Chinese and American operations, Fushi <b>Copperweld</b> maintains a production facility in Telford, England, and a distribution hub in Liège, Belgium.|$|E
50|$|Dofasco (today a {{division}} of Arcelor Mittal) acquired most of the LTV <b>Copperweld</b> assets, including 50% of the bimetallic wire division, which would in turn be sold to a private investor in 2006 and operated as <b>Copperweld</b> Bimetallics LLC. It was the only division of the previous conglomerate to continue to operate under the <b>Copperweld</b> name, and kept the established brand as a registered trademark for its copper-clad steel conductors.|$|E
50|$|In {{conjunction}} with Battelle Memorial Institute, the company developed a second bimetallic product line, an aluminum-covered steel wire that it branded as Alumoweld® in 1959. The new product was successful, {{and the company}} engaged in its first international joint venture in 1966, {{with the creation of}} the Japan Alumoweld Company of Numazu, Japan. <b>Copperweld's</b> stake was 45%, with the remainder owned by Japanese wire and cable manufacturer Fujikura Ltd.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, Imetal {{took over}} English China Clays plc, a major UK {{producer}} of white pigments (kaolin and calcium carbonates), and then {{changed its name}} to Imerys. Following this acquisition, Imetal refocused its activity on minerals processing, selling its Metal Transformation business, including the North American companies <b>Copperweld</b> and <b>Copperweld</b> Canada (now Fushi <b>Copperweld).</b> To mark this development, Imetal changed its name, giving birth to Imerys on 22 September 1999.|$|E
50|$|In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court {{ruled in}} favor of <b>Copperweld</b> in a {{landmark}} antitrust case, <b>Copperweld</b> Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., that a parent company is incapable of conspiracy with a wholly owned subsidiary.|$|E
5000|$|In 1999, Cleveland, Ohio-based LTV Steel {{acquired}} <b>Copperweld</b> Corporation from Imétal for $650 million, and the subsidiary {{became known}} as LTV <b>Copperweld.</b> At that time, the company was the largest producer of structural steel tubing in North America with 23 plants and employing 3,500 people. [...] But LTV was drowning in debt, {{and at the end}} of 2000, LTV, along with 48 subsidiaries, including <b>Copperweld,</b> filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.|$|E
50|$|<b>Copperweld</b> Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the order}} of conservators, LTV's various {{subsidiaries}} were sold off. But because the LTV <b>Copperweld</b> division maintained profitable operations throughout LTV's bankruptcy proceeding, {{it was able to}} secure separate debtor-in-possession financing through GE Commercial Finance. In late 2003, LTV <b>Copperweld</b> emerged from bankruptcy.|$|E
50|$|In 1989, <b>Copperweld</b> and Fujikura {{announce}} a second joint venture together, the United States Alumoweld Company, {{to be located}} in Duncan, South Carolina. In 1992, the <b>Copperweld</b> Corporation divested itself of the Alumoweld® business altogether, selling its shares and {{the rights to the}} brand to Fujikura.|$|E

50|$|The severe steel {{crisis of}} the late 1970s and early 1980s hit <b>Copperweld</b> hard. The venerable Glassport {{facility}} would close entirely in 1983. In 1986, the Oswego fine wire division was shut down. Both operations were relocated to <b>Copperweld</b> Southern in Fayetteville, largely due to cheaper labor costs in the South.|$|E
5000|$|French {{holding company}} Imétal S.A. (today known as Imerys), {{owned by the}} Rothschild family, {{acquired}} controlling interest of <b>Copperweld</b> Corporation in 1975. Imétal's acquisition of <b>Copperweld</b> represented the first hostile takeover of an American company by a foreign entity. [...] Imétal vowed not {{to interfere with the}} theretofore successful company's direction.|$|E

50|$|In 1972, <b>Copperweld</b> Steel Co. {{acquired}} the Chicago-based Regal Tube division of Lear-Siegler.|$|E

50|$|However, Imétal's gamble paid off. <b>Copperweld</b> Corporation {{returned}} to profitability {{just one year}} after the spin-off of CSC Industries, which, by contrast, was doomed. The newly formed company never turned a profit in its entire history, and went bankrupt in 1993. The assets of CSC Industries were acquired in a bidding war by Ohio-based Hamlin Holdings in 1995, and they discontinued use of the <b>Copperweld</b> name.|$|E
50|$|Three months later, Fushi International {{was listed}} on the Nasdaq, and {{changed its name to}} Fushi <b>Copperweld,</b> capitalizing on the {{established}} brand name in the west.|$|E
5000|$|With {{access to}} capital markets, Fushi <b>Copperweld</b> engaged {{in a series of}} acquisitions, {{bringing}} its total number of manufacturing facilities to six, which operate as wholly owned subsidiaries: ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Copperweld</b> Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., , {{is a major}} US {{antitrust}} law case decided by the Supreme Court concerning the Pittsburgh firm <b>Copperweld</b> Corporation and the Chicago firm Independence Tube. It that held that a parent company is incapable of conspiring with its wholly owned subsidiary for purposes of Section 1 of the Sherman Act because they cannot be considered separate economic entities. Section 1 of the Sherman Act states that [...] "Every contract, combination {{in the form of}} trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal." [...] However, for a condition of conspiracy to exist, there must be at least two parties involved. <b>Copperweld</b> held that separate incorporation was not enough to render a parent and its subsidiary capable of conspiring, since forcibly the economic interests of a wholly owned subsidiary must be those of its parent. It does not apply to partially owned subsidiaries.|$|E
50|$|After the war, the {{resurgence}} of the American economy helped <b>Copperweld</b> thrive. The company's management offices relocated from Glassport to downtown Pittsburgh soon after the war. Although there was considerable investment in existing divisions, acquisition became another of the company's major growth paths. In 1951, the company acquired the Flexo Wire Co. of Oswego, New York. The next year, <b>Copperweld</b> entered into the steel tube manufacturing business with the acquisition of Ohio Seamless Tubing Company of Shelby, Ohio. In 1957, the company merged with stainless steel finisher Superior Steel Company, but sold off the division {{after five years of}} poor performance.|$|E
5000|$|Independence Tube {{commenced}} a {{civil action}} under Section 1 of the Sherman Act against <b>Copperweld</b> Corporation, its wholly owned subsidiary (" [...] Regal Tube Corporation"), {{and a third}} party company that supplied mill ("Yoder Company"). Amongst others, Independence Tube claimed that <b>Copperweld</b> Corporation and Regal Tube Corporation had induced Yoder Company to breach a supply contract with Independence Tube to provide a tubing mill. This led to a nine months delay in Independence Tube's entry into the steel tubing business. The Supreme Court considered whether Independence Tube's claim under Section 1 of the Sherman Act could succeed in relation to coordinated acts of a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary.|$|E
50|$|In late 2013, <b>Copperweld</b> Bimetallics LLC, the company's American subsidiary, {{purchased}} most of {{the assets}} of its biggest American competitor,the Bimetals division of CommScope, relocating their equipment from Statesville, North Carolina to Copperweld's plant in Fayetteville, Tennessee.|$|E
50|$|In 1927, {{the company}} {{installed}} {{itself in a}} former axe factory in Glassport, Pennsylvania. <b>Copperweld</b> Steel went public {{for the first time}} in 1929, shortly before the onset of the Great Depression, but its shares were eventually withdrawn.|$|E
50|$|In 1974, the company's third {{foray into}} bimetallics was {{realized}} {{when the company}} opened a CCA wire manufacturing plant in Fayetteville, Tennessee. That division, <b>Copperweld</b> Southern, {{would go on to}} become the focus of the company's bimetallic wire operation.|$|E
50|$|Copper-clad steel (CCS), {{also known}} as copper-covered steel or the trademarked name <b>Copperweld</b> is a {{bi-metallic}} product, mainly used in the wire industry that combines the high mechanical resistance of steel with the conductivity and resistance to corrosion of copper.|$|E
50|$|A {{group of}} {{engineers}} (S. E. Bramer, Jacob Roth, F. R. S. Kaplan, Simon Loeb and William Smith, Sr.) in the Pittsburgh industrial town of Rankin, Pennsylvania first created a permanent metallurgical bond between copper and steel in 1915. This bond originally was made under a molten weld process. Their product, a CCS wire patented under {{the brand name}} <b>Copperweld,</b> was soon adopted {{as an alternative to}} solid copper wire in many conductor applications, particularly those where copper would be too ductile or would not offer the breaking strength of steel. The original use, however, was for watch springs: the copper cladding prevented corrosion. The company was founded as the Copper-Clad Steel Company, but in 1924, changed its name to the <b>Copperweld</b> Steel Company.|$|E
50|$|Now a small company, <b>Copperweld</b> had {{struggled}} {{for a number}} of years under the pall of its previous bankruptcy. In August 2007, however, the owner sold the company for $22.5 million USD to Fushi International, founded by Li Fu in 2001. The acquisition is significant because it represents the first major investment in the state of Tennessee for a mainland Chinese company. Fushi International had quickly grown to be the preeminent supplier of CCA wire in China, but was virtually unknown outside the PRC. For some time, the company had been seeking to broaden its market footprint globally. By acquiring <b>Copperweld,</b> it not only opened up a worldwide distribution channel, it also gained product diversification by the presence of CCS wire in its new subsidiary's lineup.|$|E
50|$|Major League Soccer - through {{precedence}} set in <b>Copperweld</b> v. Independence Tube - {{argued that}} as a single entity with its investors, it could not conspire with itself because it functioned as a single business enterprise. MLS argued that controlling player salaries was critical to MLS' success.|$|E
50|$|Born in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, Lenora {{became a}} pioneer in women's baseball, and was {{featured}} in the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, NY on November 6, 1988. As well, she was a local duckpin bowler. She worked for the Glasshouse in Glassport, Operating Engineers Local 66 Insurance Fund in Monroeville and <b>Copperweld</b> until she retired. She died in Herminie, PA.|$|E
5000|$|In a bold move to {{shed the}} company of its {{crippled}} steel manufacturing operations and concentrate on fabricated steel products, Imétal spun off Copperweld's Warren, Ohio operation into a separate publicly traded company in 1986. That company, CSC Industries, would continue to operate as the <b>Copperweld</b> Steel Company, causing confusion. For some time, two [...] "Copperwelds" [...] existed.|$|E
50|$|After {{selling his}} {{pharmacy}} {{in the early}} 1940s, Samuel T. Shear, the second generation of the family, entered the drayage business. Under Sam’s leadership, the company's delivery fleet grew and warehousing and distribution services were added. By 1966, Shear Trucking Company employed over 20 drivers and was servicing customers such as <b>Copperweld</b> Steel, Mattel Toys, Kimberly-Clark, Kaufmann's and Gimbel's Department Store.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of CCA, or {{copper-clad}} aluminum, the key benefit over solid copper is lighter weight and flexibility. In 2011, Fushi <b>Copperweld</b> announced a continuation of its agreement with Nexans to license its proprietary method of producing CCA. The company is able to draw the bimetallic wire down to sizes as fine as 0.03 millimeters, or one-fifth the diameter of a human hair.|$|E
