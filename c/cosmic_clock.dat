Using a technique called pulsar timing, the exact measurement of pulse arrival times allows a number of applications, ranging from testing theories of gravity to detecting gravitational waves. Also an external reference system suitable for autonomous space navigation can be defined by pulsars, using them as natural navigation beacons, not unlike the use of GPS satellites for navigation on Earth. By comparing pulse arrival times measured on-board a spacecraft with predicted pulse arrivals at a reference location (e. g. the solar system barycenter), the spacecraft position can be determined autonomously and with high accuracy everywhere {{in the solar system}} and beyond.

Ever since, pulsars have been used as precise <b>cosmic</b> <b>clocks,</b> taking us beyond the weak-eld regime of the solar-system in the study of theories of gravity. Their contribution is crucial as no test can be considered to be complete without probing the strong-eld realm of gravitational physics by nding and timing pulsars. This is particularly highlighted by the discovery of the rst double pulsar system which was discovered by our team in 2003. The double pulsar is unique in that both neutron stars are detectable as radio pulsars. This, combined with signicantly higher mean orbital velocities and accelerations when compared to other binary pulsars, suggested that the system would become the best available testbed for general relativity and alternative theories of gravity in the strong-eld regime. Indeed, this has been achieved only three years after its discovery with four independent strong-eld tests of GR, more than has been obtained for any other system. Use of the theory-independent mass ratio of the two stars makes these tests uniquely dierent from all preceding studies. Our results con rm the validity of GR at the 0. 05 % level, which is by far the best precision yet achieved for the strong-eld regime. Remarkably, the transverse velocity of the systems center of mass is extremely small, a result which is important for future GR tests and evolutionary studies. ...|$|R
40|$|Abridged. White dwarf {{stars are}} the final {{evolutionary}} {{stage of the}} vast majority of stars, including our Sun. The study of white dwarfs has potential applications to different fields of astrophysics. In particular, they can be used as independent reliable <b>cosmic</b> <b>clocks,</b> and can also provide valuable information about the fundamental parameters {{of a wide variety of}} stellar populations, like our Galaxy and open and globular clusters. In addition, the high densities and temperatures characterizing white dwarfs allow to use these stars as cosmic laboratories for studying physical processes under extreme conditions that cannot be achieved in terrestrial laboratories. They can be used to constrain fundamental properties of elementary particles such as axions and neutrinos, and to study problems related to the variation of fundamental constants. In this work, we review the essentials of the physics of white dwarf stars. Special emphasis is placed on the physical processes that lead to the formation of white dwarfs as well as on the different energy sources and processes responsible for chemical abundance changes that occur along their evolution. Moreover, in the course of their lives, white dwarfs cross different pulsational instability strips. The existence of these instability strips provides astronomers with an unique opportunity to peer into their internal structure that would otherwise remain hidden from observers. We will show that this allows to measure with unprecedented precision the stellar masses and to infer their envelope thicknesses, to probe the core chemical stratification, and to detect rotation rates and magnetic fields. Consequently, in this work, we also review the pulsational properties of white dwarfs and the most recent applications of white dwarf asteroseismology. Comment: 85 pages, 28 figures.
