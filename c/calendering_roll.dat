40|$|The fluid {{mechanics}} of two sheet-forming operations are considered. For the die sheeting operation, a design methodology for linearly tapered coathanger dies (LTCDs) is proposed and explored through 1 -D and 3 -D analyses. For the calendering operation, {{a method for}} on-line rheology measurement is explored and validated for finite- (2 -D) and infinite-width (1 -D) cases. ^ The design methodology for LTCDs proposes an aspect ratio-dependent critical angle at which the flow distribution is least dependent on changes in the fluid flow index (n). It is generally accepted that the flow distribution in a LTCD is highly dependent on n. The assumptions and conclusions of the 1 -D model used to develop the methodology are explored through finite element results of a 3 -D model. Upon examination {{of the distribution of}} residence times of dies designed at the optimal angle, unique attributes are revealed. The normalized residence time distribution of dies designed at the critical angle is independent of aspect ratio. The developed design methodology may prove useful because of its minimal sensitivity to changes in flow index and its unique scaling properties. ^ Although there exists mention of rheology measurement during calendering in the literature, the current research presents a systematic means of on-line rheology measurement for the case of a finite- (FW) or infinite-width (IW) sheet. For the IW case, power is measured while the ratio of roll radius to gap is held constant; the FW case requires the ratio of sheet width to roll gap also be held constant. The measured power is scaled by system variables, and the power-law parameters are obtained from linear regression statistics. Varying the roll speed and reduction ratio varies the scaled power. The resulting measures of power-law rheology can be fed to an on-line control system or used in a statistical quality control program. The calculated power and normal force on the <b>calendering</b> <b>roll</b> can also be useful in design calculations at the manufacturing stage. ...|$|E

50|$|The monastery {{had been}} a centre of pre-industrial-age {{metallurgy}} and in 1366 had been granted the right to mine and process iron ore from Emperor Charles IV., only one year after he had given it erroneously to a local count. The monks then started what became later the industrial company with the longest historic tradition in Germany, the Schwäbische Hüttenwerke GmbH. 1651 a furnace was lit and smelting didn't stop until 1908, when it had ceased to be profitable. However, the business was successfully shifted to finished products, especially to <b>calender</b> <b>rolls</b> for the paper industry, which made Königsbronn and SHW famous. Two out of three {{state of the art}} <b>calender</b> <b>rolls</b> in modern paper machines worldwide have been poured in the Königsbronn foundry, which today is a part of SHW Casting Technologies GmbH, a group of foundries specialized on heavy and highly precise castings.|$|R
50|$|Curtain coating is {{a process}} that creates an {{uninterrupted}} curtain of fluid that falls onto a substrate. The substrate is transported on a conveyor belt or <b>calender</b> <b>rolls</b> at a regulated speed through the curtain to ensure an even coat of the die. The curtain is created by using a slit or die {{at the base of the}} holding tank, allowing the liquid to fall upon the substrate. Some polymers are melted and extruded for coating. Many manufactures will also include a catch pan to retrieve and reuse the excess fluid.|$|R
50|$|Calendered vinyl film or Calendered vinyl sheeting, is {{manufactured}} by mixing powdered PVC, liquid softener and coloring agent into a molten dough-like mixture. The mixture is then extruded through a die, and pressed into an increasingly thin sheet using {{a series of}} hard pressure rollers, called <b>calendering</b> <b>rolls.</b> When the material reaches the calendaring rolls, it passes {{through a series of}} decreasing gaps, which, in turn, increases the temperature and uniformity of the mixture. After each pass, the film becomes thinner and wider until the material is formed into a thin sheet of vinyl. The vinyl is then cooled, wound, and later coated with adhesive.|$|R
40|$|The heat {{transfer}} characteristics of turbulent impinging jets, typical of {{those used in}} paper machine cross machine direction caliper profile control were measured. The effect of jet entrainement on the impingement {{heat transfer}} by unconfined jets was successfully scaled using a jet thermal entrainement factor. The addition of a confinement plate to an existing unconfined impinging jet control system was shown to improve the average heat transfer by 33 % and 80 % for a nozzle-to-impingement surface spacing of 2 and 1 respectively. The thermal deformation of <b>calender</b> <b>roll</b> under control actuators was predicted numerically using finite volume and finite element techniques. The most desirable steady state control characteristics, i. e. high peak deformation and small width of deformation, were obtained on unheated rolls of minimum practical thickness. The results indicate that control actuator spacings less than 0. 2 m provide negligible control advantage. Experiments were performed on a double calender stack of a production newsprint machine to determine the optimal position for cross-machine direction calender control actuators which would minimize the response time and maximize {{the magnitude of the}} response. Control on the queen roll and the two rolls immediately above it produces the strongest response. The king roll and the top roll, each of which affects only one nip, are shown to be poor choices for the placement of control actuators. When two calenders are used in succession, the actuators should be placed in the first stack. <b>Calender</b> <b>roll</b> design must be considered when choosing the location for control actuators...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} paper calender {{was designed}} and built to measure paper strain in the nip of the calender {{as a function of}} machine speed, load and <b>calender</b> <b>roll</b> radius. The effect of roll deflection due to bending was eliminated by making the calender as narrow as possible while still reproducing industrial conditions in all other aspects. The width of the new machine is 75 mm. Permanent paper strains measured with the new equipment reproduced previously published results. In-nip paper strains were obtained under a variety of calendering conditions. Paper strains under load have previously been obtained in a platen press; the new data also reproduce these results. The equipment can now be used for a full experimental program to determine an empirical relationship between paper stress (in terms of the calendering variables) and strain (in terms of paper thickness in the nip) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{dynamic model}} of the {{calendering}} of paper which incorporates relationships for both roll local thermal deformation and the stress-strain behaviour of paper in and after the nip was developed, validated, then used to demonstrate its application to model predictive control of calendering. The experimental determination of the stress-strain behaviour of paper included documenting the effect of initial temperature and moisture content as well as process parameters, and was expressed as the in-nip calendering equation. The rheological behaviour of commercial newsprint made from thermomechanical pulp {{was found to be}} a strong nonlinear function of temperature and moisture content over the wide range of 20 to 80 °C and 1 to 14 % moisture. A simplified model for the transient local deformation of a <b>calender</b> <b>roll</b> in response to a local cross-machine (CD) control action was determined and validated against the previous complete numerical analysis solution for a variety of roll designs and thermal boundary conditions. This model, appropriate for use in real-time control, was shown to be effective in seeking a compromise between the conflicting CD control objectives of large roll deformation, fine CD resolution and fast control response time. From the above two elements a dynamic {{model of the}} calendering process was developed by appropriate combination of the model of transient local <b>calender</b> <b>roll</b> deformation with the in-nip calendering equation used to estimate, at a specific CD position, in-nip strain from permanent strain. Use of the model shows that paper response to a control action is highly sensitive to local nip load and to temperature and moisture content of the paper. After validation with published measurements on an industrial calender, the effectiveness of this model for minimizing thickness nonuniformity in the CD dimension through implementation of model predictive control of calendering was demonstrated. For a multi-roll calender stack of industrial specifications this demonstration showed an impressive reduction in CD control response time through use of multi-step control action. This model opens the prospect of a significant industrial innovation through the introduction of model predictive control to the difficult problem of CD control of calendering...|$|R
40|$|This {{summarizing}} report {{discusses the}} materials and application prospects for higher purity in steels, which will make possible further advances in materials behaviour and workability. Improvements in purity and homogeneity permit in particular more rational production of thin foils and wire, one-piece shaping of complicated bodywork components and the drawing, wall-ironing and flanging of two-piece beverage cans. Welded designs in plant and mechanical engineering can be fabricated with less effort and less weight. Difficult component geometries and shaping processes can be more easily mastered. Steels with optimized fracture toughness can be exposed to more extreme loads at even lower temperatures : applications worthy of mention include offshore engineering and large-diameter linepipes for use in arctic regions and at great underwater depths. Liquefied-gas transport vessels can be made more resistant to brittle rupture. The bending fatigue strength and service-life of valve-spring and rolling-bearing steels can be significantly increased. High-purity surfaces on piston rods and cylinders guarantee reliability in hydraulic systems, and high-purity <b>calendering</b> <b>rolls</b> permit defect-free embossing of paper surfaces...|$|R

30|$|It is {{well known}} that superhydrophobicity can only be {{observed}} on rough surfaces, i.e., both chemical and physical effects contribute to superhydrophobicity. Classical theories by Wenzel [27] and Cassie and Baxter [28] have been used to explain observed contact angles on rough substrates: on rough, hydrophobic surfaces, the water droplet resides mostly on air and thus exhibits very high contact angles. Shibuichi et al. [29, 30] presented an elegant analysis of how apparent contact angles are affected by the surface roughness compared to a smooth surface. Here, in our study, the bulk compressibility of the reference paperboard has a minor effect on water contact angles whereas superhydrophobic TiO 2 nanoparticle-coated paperboard supports the analysis by Shibuichi et al. [29, 30]: increasing the number of calendering nips results in a decrease of the water contact angles on the hydrophobic side and increase on the hydrophilic side after the ultraviolet treatment in Figure  2. This is expected as adding the number of successive calendering nips will reduce surface roughness. The water contact angle is approximately 130 ° and 25 ° after 15 calendering nips for TiO 2 nanoparticle-coated samples without and with UV treatment, respectively. This indicates that the TiO 2 nanoparticles do not adhere to the steel <b>calender</b> <b>roll</b> but rather remain on the paperboard surface. Removal of the nanoparticles from the surface would bring the contact angles closer to those values of the reference paperboard in which the water contact angles are almost independent of both the number of calendering nips and the UV treatment.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with a floor application Calendering processing using both a PVC and a Polyolefin formulation within a two <b>roll</b> <b>Calender.</b> The Rheology of both formulations was measured using the Rheoplast, a specific capillary Rheometer.

An isothermal model based on the lubrication approximations hypothesis together with a power-law behavior for the molten polymer has been developed. Due {{to the difference between}} the rotation velocities of the two cylinders, the problem is no longer symmetric and the integration of the generalized Reynolds equation requires taking into account various velocity profiles.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{calendering}} {{is used as}} a downstream technique to shape monolithic co-extruded fixed-dose combination products in a continuous way. Co-extrudates with a metoprolol tartrate-loaded sustained-release core and a hydrochlorothiazide-loaded immediate-release coat were produced and immediately shaped into a monolithic drug delivery system via <b>calendering,</b> using chilled <b>rolls</b> with tablet-shaped cavities. In vitro metoprolol tartrate release from the ethylcellulose core of the calendered tablets was prolonged in comparison with the sustained release of a multiparticulate dosage form, prepared manually by cutting co-extrudates into mini-matrices. Analysis of the dosage forms using X-ray micro-computed tomography only detected small differences between the pore structure of the core of the calendered tablet and the mini-matrices. Diffusion path length was shown to be the main mechanism behind the release kinetics. Terahertz pulsed imaging visualized that adhesion between the core and coat of the calendered tablet was not complete and a gradient in coat thickness (varying from 200 to 600 μm) was observed. Modulated differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction indicated that the solid-state properties of both drugs were not affected by the calendering procedure...|$|R
40|$|Many fibrous {{materials}} such as nonwovens are consolidated via compaction rolls in a so-called <b>calendering</b> process. Hot <b>rolls</b> compress the fiber assembly and cause fiber-to-fiber bonding resulting in a strong yet porous structure. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for generating three dimensional virtual fiberwebs and simulating the geometrical changes that happen to the structure during the calendering process. Fibers {{are assumed to be}} continuous filaments with square cross sections lying randomly in the x or y direction. The fibers are assumed to be flexible to allow bending over one another during the compression process. Lateral displacement is not allowed during the compaction process. The algorithm also does not allow the fibers to interpenetrate or elongate and so the mass of the fibers is conserved. Bending of the fibers is modeled either by considering a constant “slope of bending” or constant “span of bending. ” The influence of the bending parameters on the propagation of compression through the material’s thickness is discussed. In agreement with our experimental observations, {{it was found that the}} average solid volume fraction profile across the thickness becomes U shaped after the calendering. The application of these virtual structures in studying transport phenomena in fibrous materials is also demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|The Monolithic Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (MSOFC) is an oxide-ceramic {{structure}} in which appropriate electronic and ionic conductors are fabricated in a honeycomb shape {{similar to a}} block of corrugated paperboard. These electronic and ionic conductors are arranged to provide short conduction paths to minimize resistive losses. The power density achievable with the MSOFC {{is expected to be}} about 8 kW/kg or 4 kW/L, at fuel efficienceis over 50 percent, because of small cell size and low resistive losses in the materials. The MSOFC operates in the range of 700 to 1000 C, at which temperatures rapid reform of hydrocarbon fuels is expected within the nickel-YSZ fuel channels. Tape casting and hot <b>roll</b> <b>calendering</b> are used to fabricate the MSOFC structure. The performance of the MSOFC has improved significantly during the course of development. The limitation of this system, based on materials resistance alone without interfacial resistances, is 0. 093 ohm-sq cm area-specific resistance (ASR). The current typical performance of MSOFC single cells is characterized by ASRs of about 0. 4 to 0. 5 ohm-sq cm. With further development the ASR is expected to be reduced below 0. 2 ohm-sq cm, which will result in power levels greater than 1. 4 W/sq cm. The feasibility of the MSOFC concept was proven, and the performance was dramatically improved. The differences in thermal expansion coefficients and firing shrinkages among the fuel cell materials were minimized. As a result of good matching of these properties, the MSOFC structure was successfully fabricated with few defects, and the system shows excellent promise for development into a practical power source...|$|R
