5|$|Also {{close to}} the 35thparallel was the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. Its opening in the early 1880s led to the {{founding}} of towns like Holbrook and Adamana. Visitors could stop at the Adamana train station, book a hotel room, and take a tour of what was then called the <b>Chalcedony</b> Forest. Over the years, the line changed hands, becoming the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and then the BNSF. More than 60 BNSF trains, mostly carrying freight, pass through the park every day. U.S. Route66, a former transcontinental auto highway developed in 1926 from part of the National Old Trails Road, ran parallel to the railroad tracks until it was decommissioned in 1985. The park has preserved within its boundaries a small grassy section of the road. Interstate40, which crosses the park, replaced the older highway.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Paleozoic {{sandstones}} of the Parnaíba Basin, {{in addition}} to hosting opal deposits, also have occurrences of <b>chalcedonies</b> with potential for mineral and ornamental handicrafts, {{in addition to}} assisting {{the understanding of the}} geological evolution of the basin. However, the <b>chalcedonies</b> were not investigated yet, and this study intended to fulfill this gap by the investigation of the <b>chalcedonies</b> of Calçadinha in Piauí. Fieldwork, microtexturals analysis, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectrometry, chemical analysis, and gemological assessments were developed. Four distinct types of <b>chalcedonies</b> have been distinguished. They stand out for their well distribution of Fe and Mn dendrites, which involves opal nodules, and contains microcavities with well-formed microcrystalline quartz, nontronite, and palygorskite. The mesoscopic features of these <b>chalcedonies</b> and cabochon and free forms cutting show potential for use in mineral crafts and semi-jewels. As expected, the <b>chalcedonies</b> are dominated by high contents of SiO 2, besides the low and variable contents of Al 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3, MgO, and TiO 2. Among trace elements that show high Ba contents, bound in barite, seem also to be a geochemical signature of the country sandstones in Parnaíba basin. These <b>chalcedonies</b> were formed during the partial solubilization of SiO 2 of sandstones, which was promoted during their tectonic formation in faults and fractures zones...|$|R

The book was written in or about 1460, and translated into Latin, and richly illuminated for Corvinus, king of Hungary, about 1483. I extract from the third book the following passage on the nature of stones. [...] "As there are three genera of men,--that is to say, nobles, men of the middle classes, and rustics,--so it appears that there are of stones. For the marbles and common stones of which we have spoken above, set forth the rustics. The porphyries and alabasters, and the other harder stones of mingled quality, represent the middle classes, if we are to deal in comparisons: and by means of these the ancients adorned their temples with incrustations and ornaments in a magnificent manner. And after these come the <b>chalcedonies</b> and sardonyxes, &c., which are so transparent that there can be seen no spot in them.[14] Thus men endowed with nobility lead a life in which no spot can be found." ...|$|R
50|$|With Creed {{controlling}} Mysticete and xerom attacking {{people across}} the planet, the group, along with Peridot and Pyrox, manage to unite the disputing factions of the Maximus Empire. With the world now united against the xerom, they set off to find the means of turning <b>Chalcedony's</b> wing-based Soma into an airship for their use. In gathering the final component inside an active volcano, Incarose attacks them and the group are forced to leave Peridot and Pyrox to die. After this, Lithia is shown to be dying, as her Spiria is in a severely weakened condition, but she resolves to live until her mission is complete. During their first assault on Mysticete, the group are repelled and end up on Minera.

Reaching Gardenia, the two are unable to prevent Creed from freeing Fluora and activating Gardenia. Gardenia instantly absorbs Fluora, and Creed fuses with it in an attempt to gain control over it. When he is defeated, Kor and Kohaku, together with his friends and the still-living Mineran Spirias, destroy Gardenia, then escape as Creed dies with Gardenia. After learning that the Minerans have a chance of being reborn, Kunzite saves the dying Lithia by sealing her inside his Spiria and entering a comatose state.

60|$|Now, however, for once, {{look at a}} {{piece of}} marble carefully, and think about it. You see this is {{one side of the}} fault; the other side is down or up, nobody knows where; but, on this side, you can trace the {{evidence}} of the dragging and tearing action. All along the edge of this marble, the ends of the fibers of the rock are torn, here an inch, and there half an inch, away from each other; and you see the exact places where they fitted, before they were torn separate: and you see the rents are now all filled up with the sanguine paste, full of the broken pieces of the rock; the paste itself seems to have been half melted, and partly to have also melted the edge of the fragments it contains, and then to have crystallized with them, and round them. And the brecciated agate I first showed you contains exactly the same phenomena; a zoned crystallization going on amidst the cemented fragments, partly altering the structure of those fragments themselves, and subject to continual change, either in the intensity of its own power, or {{in the nature of the}} materials submitted to it;--so that, at one time, gravity acts upon them, and disposes them in horizontal layers, or causes them to droop in stalactites; and at another, gravity is entirely defied, and the substances in solution are crystallized in bands of equal thickness on every side of the cell. It would require a course of lectures longer than these (I have a great mind,--you have behaved so saucily--to stay and give them) to describe to you the phenomena of this kind, in agates and <b>chalcedonies</b> only,--nay, there is a single sarcophagus in the British Museum, covered with grand sculpture of the 18th dynasty, which contains in magnificent breccia (agates and jaspers imbedded in porphyry), out of which it is hewn, material for the thought of years; and record of the earth-sorrow of ages in comparison with the duration of which, the Egyptian letters tell us but the history of the evening and morning of a day.|$|R

25|$|As {{a part of}} a {{sedimentary}} or metamorphic rock, fossils {{undergo the}} same diagenetic processes as does the containing rock. A shell consisting of calcite can, for example, dissolve while a cement of silica then fills the cavity. In the same way, precipitating minerals can fill cavities formerly occupied by blood vessels, vascular tissue or other soft tissues. This preserves the form of the organism but changes the chemical composition, a process called permineralization. The most common minerals involved in permineralization are cements of carbonates (especially calcite), forms of amorphous silica (<b>chalcedony,</b> flint, chert) and pyrite. In the case of silica cements, the process is called lithification.|$|E
25|$|Tool types {{found in}} Acheulean assemblages include pointed, cordate, ovate, ficron, and bout-coupé hand-axes (referring to {{the shapes of}} the final tool), cleavers, {{retouched}} flakes, scrapers, and segmental chopping tools. Materials used were determined by available local stone types; flint is most often associated with the tools but its use is concentrated in Western Europe; in Africa sedimentary and igneous rock such as mudstone and basalt were most widely used, for example. Other source materials include <b>chalcedony,</b> quartzite, andesite, sandstone, chert, and shale. Even relatively soft rock such as limestone could be exploited. In all cases the toolmakers worked their handaxes close to the source of their raw materials, suggesting that the Acheulean was a set of skills passed between individual groups.|$|E
25|$|Silicon dioxide (SiO2), {{also known}} as silica, {{is one of the}} most well-studied compounds, second only to water. Twelve {{different}} crystal modifications of silica are known, the most common being α-quartz, a major constituent of many rocks such as granite and sandstone. It is also known to occur pure as rock crystal; impure forms are known as rose quartz, smoky quartz, morion, amethyst, and citrine. Some poorly crystalline forms of quartz are also known, such as <b>chalcedony,</b> chrysoprase, carnelian, agate, onyx, jasper, heliotrope, and flint. Other modifications of silicon dioxide are known in some other minerals such as tridymite and cristobalite, as well as the much less common coesite and stishovite. Biologically generated forms are {{also known as}} kieselguhr and diatomaceous earth. Vitreous silicon dioxide is known as tectites, and obsidian, and rarely as lechatelierite. Some synthetic forms are known as keatite and W-silica. Opals are composed of complicated crystalline aggregates of partially hydrated silicon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{jewellery}} {{will have}} been designed and selected for its talismanic, religious or personal significance. A gold amulet pendant, intended for suspension around the neck (and with parallels including one from York), was filled with sulphur, possibly because of its apotropaic qualities. One ring is set with an engraved gem of brown <b>chalcedony</b> 13 x 9.5mm. Upon it is depicted a cock-headed, snake-legged deity known as an Anguipede, holding a shield which is inscribed in Greek with ΩΑΙ, ΙΑΩ or 'Iao' in reverse - a powerful magical word often associated with this deity (see Voces mysticae). Although set in a closed-back setting, this gem was also inscribed on its reverse side with the Greek ΑΒΡΑϹΞϹΑΒΑΩΘ which translates as 'Abrasax Sabaoth' also a word of power and associated name of the deity. It is interesting that a Greek-inscribed charm appears in a hoard primarily associated with an Italian (Latin) minor deity (Faunus), though many other Greek inscriptions are known from Roman Britain, and other examples of late-Antique 'magical gems' have also been found in Latin-speaking provinces.|$|E
500|$|The {{excavations}} at {{the site}} revealed evidence of human occupation from a period that lasted 8,000 years, and that the area was home to humans {{as long ago as}} 11,230 years ago. The people living {{at the site}} hunted game such as elk and deer using atlatls, and also hunted smaller mammals such as beavers, while they gathered mussels from the river. The excavation turned up graves, which included beads carved from shells and spear points. One grave, that of a child, held five matching knives made of stone. The excavation also turned up <b>chalcedony</b> and chert projectile points. Those in the upper layers were made of agate, which is not found in the area. Stone tools were found as well, such as scrapers for use in tanning hides, and mortars and pestles. In layers dated to 7,000 years ago, a large number of shells belonging to a snail of the genus Olivella were found, which would have been imported from the West Coast of the United States, [...] away.

2500|$|The {{lava flows}} formed the {{conditions}} {{for the creation of}} Lake Superior agates. As the lava solidified, gas trapped within the flows formed an amygdaloidal texture (literally, rock filled with small vesicles). Later, groundwater transported dissolved minerals through the vesicles depositing concentric bands of fine-grained quartz called <b>chalcedony.</b> [...] The color scheme is caused by the concentration of iron present in the groundwater at the time that each new layer was being deposited. [...] The process went on until the cavity had been completely filled. Over time erosion freed the agates from the solidified lava, which is not as hard as quartz.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{important}} distinction between types of quartz {{is that of}} macrocrystalline (individual crystals visible to the unaided eye) and the microcrystalline or cryptocrystalline varieties (aggregates of crystals visible only under high magnification). The cryptocrystalline varieties are either translucent or mostly opaque, while the transparent varieties tend to be macrocrystalline. <b>Chalcedony</b> is a cryptocrystalline form of silica consisting of fine intergrowths of both quartz, and its monoclinic polymorph moganite. Other opaque gemstone varieties of quartz, or mixed rocks including quartz, often including contrasting bands or patterns of color, are agate, carnelian or sard, onyx, [...] heliotrope, and jasper.|$|E

Other natural materials occasionally confused with or used in lieu of turquoise include: variscite and [...] faustite; chrysocolla (especially when impregnating quartz); lazulite; smithsonite; hemimorphite; wardite; and a fossil bone or tooth called odontolite or [...] "bone turquoise", coloured blue naturally by the mineral vivianite. While rarely encountered today, odontolite was once mined in large quantities—specifically for its use as a substitute for turquoise—in southern France.|$|E
2500|$|Matson found {{valuable}} {{support in}} Vipassana meditation and extensive psychotherapy during these later decades. Both endeavors brought depth to poems about relationships. Equal in Desire (ManRoot, San Francisco, 1982 and 1983) also expanded the direct expression style into love poems, {{at the same}} time including awareness of gender and pro-feminist concerns. Hourglass (Seagull Press, Oakland, CA: 1987) is a series of eight-syllable line sonnets with rhyme and half-rhyme schemes, each with a creative process travelogue in prose. All the poems celebrate meditation and the relation of mind and body, along with struggles inherent in establishing a practice. These came as his meditation took hold and blossomed. After he began Crazy Child workshops, Matson discovered he was one of many who, on cracking {{open the door to the}} creative unconscious, was overwhelmed by floods of images. Chaotic first drafts were eventually shaped into Squish Boots (Broken Shadow Publications, Oakland, CA: 2002), concerned with childhood and core family issues. The process fit William Carlos Williams’ teaching, [...] "The beauty of writing is…the discovery of something you DON’T know, rather than the synthesis [...] repetition of the things you do already know. It's a jump forward into life, unknown future life…." [...] Emotional daring and openness helped this effort contribute to the voice of <b>Chalcedony</b> Songs (Minotaur Press, WA: 2007, 2009). These came as protest of one of Matson's female characters, in an unfinished story, who faked her orgasms. <b>Chalcedony</b> explores intricate layers of love and relationship in an open and easily involved manner. Matson stayed with the challenge. He wrote from a female perspective and let that voice expand. The style, added to the consciousness of Squish Boots, developed into Matson's most authentic voice to date. In the background resonates his learning from Ancient Greek Classics, William Shakespeare, Walt Whitman, Ranier Maria Rilke, Pablo Neruda and Rumi, as well as contemporary poets. The voice aided in making a flexible structure for a series of poems, War Allies, inspired by difficult political times toward the end of the 20th Century, by 9/11, and by the encroachment of marketing into our private lives. The collection is scheduled for production by Torean Horn Press of Sonoma, California, in 2018. These poems, along with <b>Chalcedony</b> and current work, indicate that the primitive heart is at the basis of Matson's effort. His poems evolve in a roughly straight line from Beat lyrics to direct expression to a deeper level of language, involving the primitive heart and limbic system. The short essay Being Present: Paleo Poetry came about with help from Marie Martin, painter and childhood friend, and from John Paige (formerly Ceely) who has remained an insightful advisor since 1964. The essay, under consideration by Ambush of San Francisco, delineates the term [...] "Paleo Poetry" [...] precisely.|$|E
2500|$|Amulets were {{particularly}} prevalent in ancient Roman society, being the inheritor {{of the ancient}} Greek tradition, and inextricably linked to Roman religion and magic (see Magic in the Greco-Roman World). Amulets are usually outside of the normal sphere of religious experience, though associations between certain gemstones and gods has been suggested. For example, Jupiter is represented on milky <b>chalcedony,</b> Sol on heliotrope, Mars on red jasper, Ceres on green jasper, and Bacchus on amethyst. Amulets are worn to imbue the wearer with the associated powers of the gods rather than for any reasons of piety. The intrinsic power of the amulet is also evident from others bearing inscriptions, such as vterfexix (utere fexix) or [...] "good luck to the user." [...] Amulet boxes could also be used, such as the example from part of the Thetford treasure, Norfolk, UK, where a gold box intended for suspension around the neck was found to contain sulphur for its apotropaic (evil-repelling) qualities.|$|E
2500|$|Bauxite ore is {{the main}} source for aluminium. Bauxite is a variety of {{laterite}} (residual sedimentary rock), so it has no precise chemical formula. It is composed mainly of hydrated alumina minerals such as gibbsite [...] in newer tropical deposits; in older subtropical, temperate deposits the major minerals are boehmite [...] and some diaspore [...] The average chemical composition of bauxite, by weight, is 45 to 60% Al2O3 and 20 to 30% Fe2O3. The remaining weight consists of silicas (quartz, <b>chalcedony</b> and kaolinite), carbonates (calcite, magnesite and dolomite), titanium dioxide and water. Bauxites of economical interest must be low in kaolinite. Formation of lateritic bauxites occurs worldwide in the 145- to 2-million-year-old Cretaceous and Tertiary coastal plains. The bauxites form elongate belts, sometimes hundreds of kilometers long, parallel to Lower Tertiary shorelines in India and South America; their distribution {{is not related to}} a particular mineralogical composition of the parent rock. Many high-level bauxites are formed in coastal plains which were subsequently uplifted to their present altitude.|$|E
