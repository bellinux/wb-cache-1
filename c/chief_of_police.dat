In questions of prosecution the police districts are subordinate to the Norwegian Prosecuting Authority and in other matters subordinate to the National Police Directorate.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, 1990 people {{applied for}} 432 {{places at the}} college. From 2010, {{admission}} is administrated through the Norwegian Universities and Colleges Admission Service. The college also has a three-year part-time master's degree in police science. As the <b>chief</b> <b>of</b> <b>police</b> and deputy <b>chief</b> <b>of</b> <b>police</b> {{are part of the}} prosecuting authority, they must be a candidate of law to act in such a position. Although there no longer is a formal requirement for such an education, the role as prosecutor effectively hinders others from holding the position.|$|E
5|$|Military {{rule was}} {{replaced}} by a civilian government by way of the Foraker Act of 1900. However, the Act stipulated that the governor, <b>chief</b> <b>of</b> <b>police</b> and top officials were presidentially appointed and they were all to be Americans.|$|E

5|$|In 1894 the {{authorities}} decided {{to abolish the}} position of bailiff and {{it was decided that}} some of its tasks would be transferred to the sheriffs. This resulted in 26 new <b>chief</b> <b>of</b> <b>police</b> positions, largely corresponding to the old bailiwicks. Some received jurisdiction over both cities and rural areas, other just rural areas. At the same time the existing police districts were expanded to include the surrounding rural areas. However, the individual bailiff were not removed from office until their natural retirement, leaving some bailiwick in place until 1919. The reform eliminated the difference between the rural and city police forces; yet the sheriffs were only subordinate to the <b>chief</b> <b>of</b> <b>police</b> in police matters—in civil matters and administration they remained under the county governors.|$|E
5|$|New Scientist {{coined the}} term {{nominative}} contradeterminism for people who move away from their name, creating a contradiction between name and occupation. Examples include Portland <b>Chief</b> <b>of</b> <b>Police</b> Danielle Outlaw, Andrew Waterhouse, a professor of wine, would-be doctor Thomas Edward Kill, who subsequently {{changed his name to}} Jirgensohn, and the Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Sin.

5|$|Acting as a {{judge in}} {{lawsuits}} {{was one of many}} duties of the county magistrate and Administrators of commanderies.

5|$|As the {{civilian}} population started to return in late September, Gospić <b>chief</b> <b>of</b> <b>police</b> Ivan Dasović proposed that {{a list of the}} returning Serbs should be drawn up, ostensibly for security purposes. According to Ante Karić, President of the Lika Crisis Headquarters (krizni stožer), Dasović feared that the returning Serbs might harbour a fifth column, undermining defence of the town. Karić reportedly opposed the move, but the list was compiled on 10 October. A similar list of Serbs returning to nearby Karlobag was prepared on 16 October.|$|E
5|$|As the {{commander}} of the Permanent Municipal Guard Corps, Luís Alves brought order to the streets of Rio de Janeiro, through his own skill and through partnership with the city's <b>chief</b> <b>of</b> <b>police,</b> Eusébio de Queirós.
