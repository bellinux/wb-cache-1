40|$|Conflict among {{multiple}} {{groups is}} {{a major source of}} difficulty in environmental conservation. People are often divided into various groups that have different social factors, sometimes leading to differences in {{the degree to which they}} cooperate in environmental conservation. This obstructs the social consensus needed to solve the environmental problems. Here we study the coupled dynamics of human socio-economic choice and lake water pollution, and examine the magnitude of the difference in <b>cooperation</b> <b>levels</b> between two groups. In the model, many players choose between a costly but cooperative option and a selfish option. The former results in a reduced phosphorus discharge into the lake. Each player's choice is affected by an economic cost and social pressure. Social pressure is a psychological factor that promotes cooperation: it becomes stronger when more players in the society are cooperative (conformist tendency) and when the problem at hand is a greater concern to society. In the model, two groups sometimes show large differences in their <b>cooperation</b> <b>levels</b> even when both have exactly the same social factors. However, <b>cooperation</b> <b>levels</b> are more likely to differ between groups that have different social factors. Enhancement of the cross-group conformist tendency is the most effective way to minimize differences in <b>cooperation</b> <b>levels</b> and to mitigate conflict between groups.

In fact, the payoff to an individual is in terms of the effect on fitness including survival and fecundity. In this paper, we introduce a model of strategy evolution with network dynamics based on mortality selection. The intensity beta of mortality selection has a nontrivial role in the evolution of both cooperation and network structure. At a defector's temptation b = 1, the system gains its maximal <b>cooperation</b> <b>level</b> at beta -> infinity. Increasing b decreases beta(max) for the maximal <b>cooperation</b> <b>level.</b> For network structure, the average degrees of strategists and the self-organization of clusters are investigated to understand the connections of strategists and their effects on <b>cooperation</b> <b>level.</b> Furthermore, we introduce the cooperating k-core to describe the tight level of the cooperator cluster. Cooperation is enhanced by forming a tight cooperating k-core at moderate beta, but there is a collapse of the cooperating k-core when beta is too large. The results indicate that cooperators outside the cooperating k-core {{play an important role in}} maintaining that core to ensure a high <b>cooperation</b> <b>level.</b> So the formation and maintenance of the cooperating k-core coordinate with each other at maximum <b>cooperation</b> <b>level</b> at a specific value of beta...|$|E

The local and global properties of the network structure, such as cluster and cooperating k-core, are investigated for the understanding of cooperation evolution.

40|$|Sometimes we punish non-cooperators in our society. Such {{behavior}} {{could be}} derived from aversive emotion for inequity (inequity aversion) to make non-cooperators cooperative. Thus, punishing behavior derived from inequity {{is believed to be}} important for maintaining our society. Meanwhile, our daily experiences suggest that the degree of cooperation by the members of society (<b>cooperation</b> <b>level</b> of the group) could change the punishing behavior for non-cooperators even if the inequity were equal. Such effect of the <b>cooperation</b> <b>level</b> of the group cannot be explained by simple inequity aversion.

40|$|This paper investigates {{experimentally}} how the endogenous group formation {{combined with}} the possibility of repeated interaction impacts <b>cooperation</b> <b>levels</b> and surplus distribution. We developed a Surplus Production Distribution Game where the cooperation of four agents is needed to produce a surplus. In case of cooperation, two of the four subjects, the distributors, decided how much of surplus each of them wanted to give to the two other agents, the receivers. This game was played repeatedly with different matching procedures. In the Re-match Treatment (RT) the subjects got randomly re-matched every round, while in the Endogenous-match Treatment (ET) a group was maintained as long as its members cooperated. There was also a Base treatment (BT) where cooperation was exogenously enforced. We found that the distributor's contributions were higher in the ET and the RT than in the BT - unsurprisingly, receivers' possibility to refuse cooperation led to more equal surplus distributions. But contrary to commonly hold beliefs, the possibility of repeated interaction did not lead to higher <b>cooperation</b> <b>levels</b> and more equal allocations of the surplus. Instead, endogenous group formation {{combined with the}} possibility of repeated interaction led to self-selection of the subjects in the ET. The endogenous group duration varied drastically between different groups in the ET, with long-lived groups exhibiting contributions and <b>cooperation</b> <b>levels</b> higher than in the RT, while short-lived groups showed contributions and <b>cooperation</b> <b>levels</b> lower than in the RT. Furthermore, for given contribution levels, receivers were more likely to refuse cooperation when their average relationship length was short. This shows that long-lived groups consisted of generous distributors and not so demanding receivers, while ungenerous distributors and demanding receivers formed short-lived groups. Hence, the possibility of repeated interaction does not necessarily increase <b>cooperation</b> and efficiency <b>levels</b> when combined with endogenous group formation. Rather, such a situation might lead to self-selection of agents. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

Through an experiment, we present evidence {{for the existence of}} a relevant behavioral dimension in addition to the standard theoretical arguments. Subjects faced repeated opportunities to help an anonymous counterpart who changed over time. Cooperation required trusting that help given to a stranger today would be returned by a stranger in the future. <b>Cooperation</b> <b>levels</b> declined when going from small to large groups of strangers, even if monitoring and payoffs from cooperation were invariant to group size. We then introduced intrinsically worthless tokens. Tokens endogenously became money: subjects took to reward help with a token and to demand a token in exchange for help. Subjects trusted that strangers would return help for a token. <b>Cooperation</b> <b>levels</b> remained stable as the groups grew larger. In all conditions, full cooperation was possible through a social norm of decentralized enforcement, without using tokens. This turned out to be especially demanding in large groups. Lack of trust among strangers thus made money behaviorally essential. To explain these results, we developed an evolutionary model. When behavior in society is heterogeneous, cooperation collapses without tokens. In contrast, the use of tokens makes cooperation evolutionarily stable...|$|R

Introducing the possibility of punishment leads to lower group income, but less inequality within groups. In both treatments (with and w/o punishment) inequality and group income are positively correlated for poor groups (with below median income), but negatively correlated for rich groups (with above median income). There is very strong path dependence: inequality in early periods is strongly negatively correlated with group income in later periods.
