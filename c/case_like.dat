5|$|L.A. Noires open {{world is}} a {{recreation}} of 1947 Los Angeles. The development team conducted field research in Los Angeles throughout the game's development, and compiled multiple aerial photographs to gather traffic and building information. Various plot points and investigations in the game are based on real life events, such as the Black Dahlia <b>case.</b> <b>Like</b> other games published by Rockstar, L.A. Noire uses licensed music provided by an in-game radio. Over 30 licensed tracks continuously loop on one radio station. The game also features an original score composed {{by a group of}} musicians and inspired by 1940s films.|$|E

5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} release of his Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell in 1845, Thomas Carlyle was asked to view the head. He did not, and {{on the basis of a}} friend's visit, wrote a scathing {{dismissal}} of the authenticity of the head: “it has hair, flesh and beard, a written history bearing that it was procured for £100 (I think of bad debt) about 50 years ago...the whole affair appears to be fraudulent moonshine, an element not pleasant even to glance into, especially in a <b>case</b> <b>like</b> Oliver's.” Fitzgibbons 2008, Pearson and Morant agree that Carlyle's dismissal was not based on any historical or scientific fact. Although Carlyle conceded that it was “the head of some decapitated man of distinction”, the only other known man of distinction to be embalmed and then decapitated in such a manner over the previous 200 years was Henry Ireton. George Rolleston had conducted an examination on another skull—called the Ashmolean skull—after claims that it was Cromwell's head. Rolleston was unconvinced by the skull's supposed history, and visited Wilkinson's home to see the skull shortly afterwards. After an examination, he dismissed the Ashmolean skull as a fake and declared that the Wilkinson head was the real head of Cromwell.|$|E

The Indiana Klan's power collapsed and the scandals contributed to the decline of Klan membership nationally.|$|E
25|$|It {{may occur}} that systems of {{coordinates}} for two {{different sets of}} geometric figures are equivalent {{in terms of their}} analysis.

Dualistic systems have the property that results from one system can be carried over to the other since these results are only different interpretations of the same analytical result; this is known as the principle of duality.|$|E

25|$|Typically, casuistic {{reasoning}} {{begins with}} a clear-cut paradigmatic case. In legal reasoning, for example, {{this might be a}} precedent case, such as premeditated murder. From it, the casuist would ask how closely the given case currently under consideration matches the paradigmatic case. Cases like the paradigmatic case ought to be treated likewise; cases unlike the paradigm ought to be treated differently. Thus, a man is properly charged with premeditated murder if the circumstances surrounding his case closely resemble the exemplary premeditated murder case. The less a given case is like the paradigm, the weaker the justification is for treating that <b>case</b> <b>like</b> the paradigmatic case.|$|E
25|$|In general, the Many-minds theory {{holds that}} a {{conscious}} being who observes {{the outcome of}} a random zero-sum experiment will evolve into two successors in different observer states, each of whom observes one of the possible outcomes. Moreover, the theory advises you to favour choices in such situations in proportion to the probability that they will bring good results to your various successors. But in a life-or-death <b>case</b> <b>like</b> getting into the box with Schrödinger's cat, you will only have one successor, since one of the outcomes will ensure your death. So it seems that the Many-minds Interpretation advises you to get in the box with the cat, since it is certain that your only successor will emerge unharmed. See also quantum suicide and immortality.|$|E
25|$|Polymorphism {{can extend}} beyond pure {{symmetry}} content. The aluminosilicates are {{a group of}} three minerals – kyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite – which share the chemical formula Al2SiO5. Kyanite is triclinic, while andalusite and sillimanite are both orthorhombic and belong to the dipyramidal point group. These difference arise correspond to how aluminium is coordinated within the crystal structure. In all minerals, one aluminium ion is always in six-fold coordination by oxygen; the silicon, as a general rule is in four-fold coordination in all minerals; an exception is a <b>case</b> <b>like</b> stishovite (SiO2, an ultra-high pressure quartz polymorph with rutile structure). In kyanite, the second aluminium is in six-fold coordination; its chemical formula can be expressed as AlAlSiO5, to reflect its crystal structure. Andalusite has the second aluminium in five-fold coordination (AlAlSiO5) and sillimanite has it in four-fold coordination (AlAlSiO5).|$|E

25|$|VAM Gremlins {{used the}} updated body {{design of the}} U.S. and Canadian market AMC Spirit two-door sedan, as well as VAM {{versions}} of the Spirit Liftback, called the American GT and the Rally AMX. At the time, cars in Mexico took longer {{to be perceived as}} outdated than in the US and since the VAM Gremlin came to the public until 1974 instead of 1970, it was still relatively fresh among the Mexican buyers. Aside from this, the model kept a positive image throughout its whole run. In fact, it exceeded VAM's sales expectations in its first years. The company originally considered it a temporary low-volume model that would eventually be replaced by the upcoming Pacer model. In the end, the Gremlin stood and became VAM's all-time second best-selling line after the American. For these reasons VAM decided to keep the Gremlin name for the upcoming Spirit sedan model, being a testament of the very favorable image VAM cars in general held in Mexico. This was the third time a <b>case</b> <b>like</b> this happened within the company with Rebel and Matador models kept the name Rambler Classic and the Hornet the Rambler American name.|$|E

500|$|... "Gone for Goode" [...] {{included}} several storylines, and even exact bits of dialogue, adapted straight from Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets. One {{of the biggest}} story arcs from the first season was the murder of 11-year-old Adena Watson, which is introduced in [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] and lasts for five episodes until [...] "Three Men and Adena". The case {{was based on the}} murder of 11-year-old Latonya Kim Wallace, which made up a major part of Simon's book. The Watson <b>case,</b> <b>like</b> the Wallace case, ultimately goes unsolved. A subplot from [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] and [...] "Son of a Gun" [...] involved the investigation into Calpurnia Smith, an elderly woman suspected of murdering five husbands in order to collect their life insurance policies. This was based on the real-life case of Geraldine Parrish, who was also accused of killing five husbands for insurance money, and was eventually convicted for three of their murders. Another multi-episode arc involved the near-fatal shooting of Patrolman Chris Thormann, which leaves the officer blind. This was also adapted from true-life events in Simon's book, although Homicide writers added the twist of Steve Crosetti taking the case personally based on his close friendship with the victim.|$|E
