5|$|Benjamin {{became a}} {{specialist}} in <b>commercial</b> <b>law,</b> of which {{there was a great}} deal in New Orleans' busy river port—a center of international commerce and the domestic slave trade. By 1840, the city had become the fourth largest in the United States and among the wealthiest. Many of the best lawyers in the country practiced <b>commercial</b> <b>law</b> there, and Benjamin successfully competed with them. In one case, he successfully represented the seller of a slave against allegations that the seller knew the slave had incurable tuberculosis. Although Benjamin tried some jury cases, he preferred bench trials in commercial cases and was an expert at appeals.|$|E

Warren was a highly influential law professor. Although she published in many fields, her expertise was in bankruptcy and <b>commercial</b> <b>law.</b> In that field, only Bob Scott of Columbia and Alan Schwartz of Yale were cited more often than Warren.|$|E
5|$|The most {{powerful}} British jurist of the century, his decisions reflected the Age of Enlightenment and moved England {{on the path}} to abolishing slavery and the slave trade. He advanced <b>commercial</b> <b>law</b> in ways that helped establish the nation as the world leader in industry, finance and trade. He modernised both English law and the English courts system; he sped up the system for submitting motions and reformed the way judgments were given to reduce time and expense for the parties. For his work in Carter v Boehm and Pillans v Van Mierop, he has been called the founder of English <b>commercial</b> <b>law.</b> He is perhaps best known for his judgment in Somersett's Case (1772), where he held that slavery had no basis in common law and had never been established by positive law (legislation) in England, and therefore was not binding law (although this did not end slave trafficking altogether).|$|E

5|$|At his father's urging after graduation, Coolidge {{moved to}} Northampton, Massachusetts {{to become a}} lawyer. To avoid the cost of law school, Coolidge {{followed}} the common practice of apprenticing with a local law firm, Hammond & Field, and reading law with them. John C. Hammond and Henry P. Field, both Amherst graduates, introduced Coolidge to law practice in the county seat of Hampshire County. In 1897, Coolidge {{was admitted to the}} Massachusetts bar, becoming a country lawyer. With his savings and a small inheritance from his grandfather, Coolidge opened his own law office in Northampton in 1898. He practiced <b>commercial</b> <b>law,</b> believing that he served his clients best by staying out of court. As his reputation as a hard-working and diligent attorney grew, local banks and other businesses began to retain his services.|$|E

40|$|Consumers {{whether in}} an Islamic State or {{otherwise}} face similar problems {{that need to}} be taken care of by the government and the individuals themselves. Islam as a religion gives a comprehensive framework for conducting business and protecting the consumers' rights. Apparently, this framework seems similar to the <b>commercial</b> <b>laws</b> but glaring differences between the two exist: <b>commercial</b> <b>laws</b> are a relatively new phenomena and are made by humans for the sake of convenience only. Islamic law on the other hand, provided such guidelines 1500 years ago that are based on divine principles set by Allah. Moreover, there is no reward in complying with the <b>commercial</b> <b>laws</b> but Allah promised the believers rewards both in this world and the Hereafter for complying with Islamic principles. Pakistan is an Islamic State but the area of consumer protection has remained neglected so far. This paper explores how an environment can be created in Pakistan whereby the interests of consumers are best protected under the teachings of Islam. The Qur'anic principles are delineated with reference to: guidelines for Muslim businessmen and consumers; the role of state and institutions.
