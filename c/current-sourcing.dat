Conversion of photodiode voltage to output current is done using transistors operating in velocity saturation region. The high output impedance {{of this region}} makes it more suitable for <b>current-sourcing</b> operation than the linear region. The transistors also exhibit high linearity, allowing us to suppress fixed pattern noise (FPN) by correcting for both offset and gain variations among pixels. Experimental results on the fabricated 110 × 200 pixel array are presented. With conventional correlated double sampling (CDS), FPN is reduced from 3. 8 % to 0. 85 %. Further reduction requires compensation of gain variations, and results in a final FPN of 0. 19 %. A triple sampling approach is introduced to implement the described correction in hardware...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A high {{frequency}} AC <b>current-sourcing</b> driver that can feed electrical loads with a constant current that {{is independent of}} the load resistance is presented, analyzed and tested experimentally. The power source is a self-oscillating inverter that includes a resonant network and a Current Comparing and Toggling Circuit (CCTC) that is used to generate the control signals of the inverter’s power switches. The power driver can be used to ignite and operate one or several serially connected fluorescent lamps, without the need of additional resonant networks and redesign of the power stage, while still maintaining high efficiency and low output crest factor. The CCTC is realized, in present work, by a multi-winding transformer that is designed to change the polarity of the gate drive of the power switches whenever the input signal drops {{to the level of the}} desired output current and hence, will cause the driver to behave as a current source...|$|E

40|$|In {{medium and}} high power applications, two topologies have evolved for {{three-phase}} six-switch static power converters with an intermediate dc link, the voltage-source and the <b>current-source.</b> Despite {{the advantages of}} the <b>current-source</b> topology such as current limiting, higher reliability, and low ac-voltage harmonic distortion, voltage-source topologies are more widely used. This is in part {{due to the fact that}} <b>current-source</b> topologies present the following difficulties: (a) a lack of on-line modulating techniques that satisfy all the constraints of their gating signals and (b) the complexity of the control schemes for medium and high power applications. This thesis provides solutions to these problems.

40|$|As {{the costs}} of {{large-scale}} power generation and transmission rise, distributed generation is becoming a prevalent alternative used by {{a growing number of}} both residences and businesses. Distributed generation systems typically consist of two main components: a small-scale, often high-efficiency or renewable power source, such as a fuel cell, solar panel, or wind turbine, and a power electronic converter to convert the raw power produced by the source to a usable form. In North America, the majority of power used in residential and light commercial locations is provided in a form known as single-phase three-wire, or split-phase. This consists of two half-phase AC voltages, each of 110 to 120 V rms, and one combined AC voltage of 220 to 240 V rms. It is therefore necessary for distributed generation systems to supply power in this same form {{so that it can be}} used by standard loads such as lighting or appliances, and the excess power can be fed back into the distribution grid. The most common type of converter used to make this conversion is the voltage-sourced inverter (VSI). There are, however, some advantages to using a <b>current-sourced</b> inverter (CSI) instead. These include improved output voltage waveform quality, built-in voltage boost, and built-in overcurrent protection. However, there are also two obstacles that have prevented the adoption of <b>current-sourced</b> inverters to date. The first obstacle to the use of <b>current-sourced</b> inverters is that they require a DC current input to operate. Therefore, a circuit and control algorithm must be developed to produce a DC current from a low DC voltage source. The first part of this thesis deals with the generation of a suitable DC current. The second major obstacle to adopting <b>current-sourced</b> inverters is that no algorithm for producing single-phase three-wire outputs with a CSI presently exists in literature. The second part of this thesis develops such a switching algorithm, using a three-leg <b>current-sourced</b> inverter. The algorithm is demonstrated using simulation and experimental results, which show that the proposed system is able to successfully generate balanced output voltages under unbalanced loading conditions while equalizing switch utilization and minimizing output voltage ripple...|$|R
