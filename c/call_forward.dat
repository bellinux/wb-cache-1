50|$|<b>Call</b> <b>forwarding,</b> or <b>call</b> diversion, is a {{telephony}} {{feature of}} some telephone switching systems which redirects {{a telephone call}} to another destination, which may be, for example, a mobile telephone, voicemail box or another telephone number where the desired called party is available. <b>Call</b> <b>forwarding</b> was invented by Ernest J. Bonanno. In North America, the forwarded line usually rings once to remind the customer using <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> that the <b>call</b> is being redirected. More consistently, the forwarded line indicates its condition by stutter dial tone. <b>Call</b> <b>forwarding</b> typically can redirect incoming calls to any other domestic telephone number, but {{the owner of the}} forwarded line must pay any toll charges for <b>forwarded</b> <b>calls.</b> <b>Call</b> <b>forwarding</b> is often enabled by dialing *72 followed by the telephone number to which <b>calls</b> should be <b>forwarded.</b> Once someone answers, <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> is in effect. If no one answers or the line is busy, the dialing sequence must be repeated to effect <b>call</b> <b>forwarding.</b> <b>Call</b> <b>forwarding</b> is disabled by dialing *73. This feature requires a subscription from the telephone company. Also available in some areas is Remote Access to <b>call</b> <b>forwarding,</b> which permit the control over <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> from telephones other than the subscriber's telephone. VOIP and cable telephone systems also often allow <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> to be set up and directed via their web portals.|$|R

50|$|It is also {{possible}} that the phone call is not answered. If the subscriber is busy on another call (and call waiting is not being used) the Visited MSC routes the call to a pre-determined <b>Call</b> <b>Forward</b> Busy (CFB) number. Similarly, if the subscriber does not answer the call after a period of time (typically 30 seconds) then the Visited MSC routes the call to a pre-determined <b>Call</b> <b>Forward</b> No Reply (CFNRy) number. Once again, the operator may decide to set this value by default to the voice mail of the mobile so that callers can leave a message.|$|E
50|$|These Android phones have a menu option “Dual SIM Always on” which when {{activated}} activates <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> on the carrier’s network. This {{can be done}} manually on any phone, {{regardless of}} manufacturer, e.g. enable <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> to SIM 1 when SIM 2 is disconnected. <b>Call</b> <b>Forwarding</b> must be provided by the carrier, often for a fee, subscriber will also be charged for <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> on a minute by minute basis, this depends on the subscription agreement.|$|R
40|$|In today’s {{world of}} {{telecommunications}} {{there is an}} increasing problem with reaching people one wishes to speak to. People have several telephones and this makes the situation complex for the caller. Many phone calls are left unanswered. The <b>Call</b> <b>Forwarding</b> Agent is in this report presented {{as a solution to}} this reachability problem. The idea is to have an agent setting <b>call</b> <b>forwards</b> of all the users’ phones or numbers, towards the terminal where he is available. Later, when someone calls any of the users’ phones, the call will be terminated at the terminal where the user can receive it. The <b>Call</b> <b>Forwarding</b> Agent is compared to a number of similar services. The personal number service offers the same functionality as the <b>Call</b> <b>Forwarding</b> Agent, but the <b>Call</b> <b>Forwarding</b> Agent does not force the subscriber to change phone number and it also admits a simple call screening. We have implemented a prototype of the <b>Call</b> <b>Forwarding</b> Agent that can set <b>call</b> <b>forwards</b> of regular Public Service Telephony Network terminals and the Internet telephones in Ellemtel’s IP-phone system...|$|R
50|$|In telecommunication, {{a remote}} <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> is a service feature that allows calls {{coming to a}} remote <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> number to be {{automatically}} forwarded to any answering location designated by the call receiver.|$|R
50|$|When a {{subscriber}} is roaming internationally and a call is {{forwarded to}} his or her voice mail, such as when his or her phone is off, busy, or not answered, he or she may actually be charged for two simultaneous international phone calls—the first to get from the GMSC to the VMSC and the second to get from the VMSC to the <b>Call</b> <b>Forward</b> Busy or <b>Call</b> <b>Forward</b> No Reply number (typically the voice mailbox) in the subscriber's country. However, some networks' GMSCs connect unanswered calls directly, keeping the voice signal entirely within the home country and thus avoiding the double charge.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the owner}} of the phone has {{previously}} requested that all incoming calls be diverted to another number, known as the <b>Call</b> <b>Forward</b> Unconditional (CFU) Number, then this number is stored in the Home Location Register. If that is the case, then the CFU number is returned to the Gateway MSC for immediate routing to that destination.|$|E
50|$|If the {{subscriber}} {{does not}} respond to the paging request, either due to being out of coverage, or their battery has gone flat/removed, then the Visited MSC routes the call to a pre-determined <b>Call</b> <b>Forward</b> Not Reachable (CFNRc) number. Once again, the operator may decide to set this value by default to the voice mail of the mobile so that callers can leave a message.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} {{the influence of a}} <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> service on the traffic process in modern telecommunication networks. We analyse in detail only the case when the called user is busy. It is proved that <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> not only increases utilization of servers and the percent of successful calls but it also increases the call loss. On the simple example, we showed that this call loss increase is greater in the case of local (internal) and incoming calls, but smaller in the case of outgoing calls. The reason for such behaviour is in the role of <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> function in the case of internal and incoming traffic. In that situation <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> function decreases the effect of limited number of users on the decrease of offered traffic, comparing to the case of internal and incoming traffic without <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> (Engset traffic model). This statement is illustrated by comparative graphics of traffic loss without <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> function, and with this function when considering, separately, internal, incoming, and outgoing traffic.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the adversarial system used by common law countries, the German system of criminal (and administrative) procedure is inquisitorial. Rather than allowing cross-examination between the defense and prosecutors, the judges conduct {{the majority of the}} trial. During a trial, the parties are expected to give all their evidence to the judges, who will then <b>call</b> <b>forward</b> and question the witnesses, after which the defense counsel and prosecutor may question the witnesses.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the mobile}} phone is not {{currently}} {{associated with a}} Visited Location Register (because the phone has been turned off) then the Home Location Register returns a number known as the <b>Call</b> <b>Forward</b> Not Reachable (CFNRc) number to the Gateway MSC, and the call is forwarded there. Many operators may set this value automatically to the phone's voice mail number, so that callers may leave a message. The mobile phone may sometimes override the default setting.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s, however, {{this view}} was coming under {{a great deal}} of strain. Increasingly, {{telephone}} users wanted to conference <b>call,</b> <b>forward,</b> and record voice greetings, so common today. Such features required more flexibility in the controller, leading to the development of computer-controlled switching machines, notably the Bell Labs − Western Electric 1ESS. These early machines still had an analog, usually electromechanical switching matrix because the technology of the time did not permit the cost-effective dedication of a filter-codec to each subscriber. (Transmission systems had already gone digital, for example the D4 carrier system.) ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the context}} of telephony, a {{telephone}} line (the system) typically offers a set of features that include <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> and <b>call</b> waiting. Call waiting allows one call to be suspended while a second call is answered, while <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> enables a customer to specify a secondary phone number to which additional <b>calls</b> will be <b>forwarded</b> {{in the event that}} the customer is already using the phone.|$|R

50|$|The first {{element of}} the Rolling Thunder {{battalion}} to cross the Kuwait - Iraq border was B battery on 27 April 2003. The remaining elements of the battalion crossed the border of Kuwait and Iraq on 4 May 2003 at approximately 0520 hours. The battalion's wheel convoy was provided MP escort for added security. The battalion was en route to AA Horse just south of Baghdad to marry up with its tracked vehicles. Once the battalion linked up with its equipment the <b>call</b> <b>forward</b> order was received and the battalion continued its march to its base position at the Baqubah airfield in northern Iraq. Here the battalion was to join the lead elements of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, Warhorse Brigade. Upon arrival the soldiers immediately begin to establish its base camp - Thunder Land.|$|E

5000|$|ACeS {{has been}} {{assigned}} the virtual country code +88220, an international networks code rather than a GMSS code as the system does not operate globally. The company currently supplies only one handset type, the Ericsson R190, which derived many components from GH688 model. R190 is a dual-mode Satellite/GSM phone which automatically switches to satellite mode when terrestrial GSM network is not available. It accepts standard GSM SIM cards, and since ACeS has international roaming agreements with many GSM networks worldwide, the phone {{can be used in}} virtually any country. The handset supports most standard services such as <b>call</b> <b>forward</b> and call waiting but does not support short message service (SMS) in satellite mode. The demise of Ericsson mobile phone business in 2001 has left ACeS with no other handset available to offer to its customers [...] As Ericsson left the mobile phone business, production of the R190 was then continued by ACeS and rebranded to be the ACeS R190. Additionally ACeS has developed a land phone version, the ACeS FR-190, that allowed many villages and rural areas throughout Asia access to basic telephony services.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new algorithm, Hit-or-Jump, for embedded testing of components of communication systems {{that can be}} modeled by communicating extended finite state machines. It constructs test sequences efficiently with a high fault coverage. It does not have state space explosion, as is often encountered in exhaustive search, and it quickly covers the system components under test without being "trapped", as is experienced by random walks. Furthermore, it is a generalization and unification of both exhaustive search and random walks; both are special cases of Hit-or-Jump. The algorithm has been implemented and applied to embedded testing of telephone services in an IN architecture, including the Basic Call Service (BCS) and five supplementary services: Originating Call Screening (OCS), Terminal Call Screening (TCS), <b>Call</b> <b>Forward</b> Unconditional (CFU), <b>Call</b> <b>Forward</b> on Busy Line (CBL) and Automatic Call Back (ACB).
