40|$|AbstractWe {{present an}} object model {{that is the}} ground for several {{software}} products written by our team in C++ and used by our customers for over 10 years. The object model has allowed us to design software packages of many components and achieve high level of code reuse due to specific features of the model. Besides the object model, we also present several <b>common</b> <b>infrastructure</b> <b>components</b> that could be useful {{for the development of}} any general-purpose software system in C++...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a pair of}} empirical tests {{that can be used}} to evaluate the technological feasibility of separating a vertically integrated network monopoly into a <b>common</b> <b>infrastructure</b> <b>component</b> and competing operating components. We implement the tests with a Generalized McFadden cost function that is globally concave in input prices and permits the assignment of zero output values without losing its flexibility properties. The tests shed light on the respective roles of regulation and competition policy. We illustrate them with an analysis of U. S. freight railroads for the period 1978 - 2001 and find both vertical and horizontal economies of scope. ...|$|R
40|$|Research projects, assistive technology, and {{individuals}} all create metadata {{in order to}} improve Web accessibility for visually impaired users. However, since these projects are disconnected from one another, this metadata is isolated in separate tools, stored in disparate repositories, and represented in incompatible formats. Web accessibility could be greatly improved if these individual contributions were merged. An integration method will serve as the bridge between future academic research projects and end users, enabling new technologies to reach end users more quickly. Therefore we introduce Accessibility <b>Commons,</b> a <b>common</b> <b>infrastructure</b> to integrate, store, and share metadata designed to improve Web accessibility. We explore existing tools to show how the metadata that they produce could be integrated into this <b>common</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> we present the design decisions made in order to help ensure that our common repository will remain relevant in the future as new metadata is developed, and we discuss how the <b>common</b> <b>infrastructure</b> <b>component</b> facilitates our broader social approach to improving accessibility.

40|$|Graph {{databases}} {{have become}} an increasingly <b>common</b> <b>infrastructure</b> <b>component.</b> Yet existing systems either operate on offline snapshots, provide weak consistency guarantees, or use expensive concurrency control techniques that limit performance. In this paper, we introduce a new distributed graph database, called Weaver, which enables efficient, transactional graph analyses as well as strictly serializable ACID transactions on dynamic graphs. The key insight that allows Weaver to combine strict serializability with horizontal scalability and high performance is a novel request ordering mechanism called refinable timestamps. This technique couples coarse-grained vector timestamps with a fine-grained timeline oracle to pay the overhead of strong consistency only when needed. Experiments show that Weaver enables a Bitcoin blockchain explorer that is 8 x faster than Blockchain. info, and achieves 12 x higher throughput than the Titan graph database on social network workloads and 4 x lower latency than GraphLab on offline graph traversal workloads...|$|R

The <b>infrastructure</b> <b>components</b> and software libraries are specifically tailored {{for the problem}} at hand and do not allow for flexible customization and provisioning of individual resource components or runtime topologies. This inherently hinders self-service, utility-oriented delivery and consumption of IoT cloud resources at fine granularity levels.|$|R
2500|$|Linkages {{between the}} IT <b>infrastructure</b> <b>components,</b> {{as well as}} {{descriptions}} of their contexts of interaction, are important for ensuring integrity and consistency among the IT <b>infrastructure</b> <b>components.</b> [...] Furthermore, IT standards have {{a major role in}} reconciling various <b>infrastructure</b> <b>components</b> to provide shared IT services that are of a certain degree of effectiveness to support business process applications, as well as to guide the process of acquiring, managing, and utilizing IT assets. The IT infrastructure shared services and the human IT <b>infrastructure</b> <b>components,</b> in terms of their responsibilities and their needed expertise, are both vital to the process of the IT infrastructure composition. [...] IT strategic alignment is approached through the process of integration between business and IT strategies, as well as between IT and organizational infrastructures.|$|R

40|$|Hydrological <b>infrastructure</b> <b>components</b> such as pumps, floodgates, {{and flood}} gauges are {{invaluable}} assets for mitigating flooding, which threatens millions of lives and damages property worth {{billions of dollars}} in coastal mega-cities around the world. By improving the understanding of how these hydrological <b>infrastructure</b> <b>components</b> are both spatially and topologically connected through waterways (rivers, canals, streams, etc.) within coastal mega-cities, more precise decisions can be made regarding the most appropriate hydrological <b>infrastructure</b> <b>components</b> required to mitigate flooding during emergency conditions. This paper explores the use of graph theory to create a spatio-topological model of a real world hydrological infrastructure network {{for one of the most}} representative coastal mega-cities-Jakarta, Indonesia. The network is modeled as a directed multigraph, with hydrological infrastructure represented as network nodes and waterways as edges. The article demonstrates how the network model can be used as a real-time decision support tool for responding to flooding events by alerting decision makers to the occurrence of rising water levels in any given area and, suggesting the most appropriate <b>infrastructure</b> <b>components</b> to engage in order to prevent a given area from flooding...|$|R

40|$|Injection vulnerabilities, such as SQL {{injection}} (SQLi), {{are ranked}} amongst {{the most dangerous}} types of vulnerabilities. Despite having received much attention from academia and practitioners, the prevalence of SQLi is common {{and the impact of}} their successful exploitation is severe. In this dissertation, we propose several security testing approaches that evaluate web applications and services for vulnerabilities and <b>common</b> IT <b>infrastructure</b> <b>components</b> such as for their resilience against attacks. Each of the presented approaches covers a different aspect of security testing, e. g. the generation of test cases or the definition of test oracles, and in combination they provide a holistic approach. The work presented in this dissertation was conducted in collaboration with SIX Payment Services (formerly CETREL S. A.). SIX Payment Services is a leading provider of financial services in the area of payment processing, e. g. issuing of credit and debit cards, settlement of card transactions, online payments, and point-of-sale payment terminals. We analyse the challenges SIX is facing in security testing and base our testing approaches on assumptions inferred from our findings. Specifically, the devised testing approaches are automated, applicable in black box testing scenarios, able to assess and bypass Web Application Firewalls (WAF), and use an accurate test oracle. The devised testing approaches are evaluated with SIX’ IT platform, which consists of various web services that process several thousand financial transactions daily. The main research contributions in this dissertation are: - An assessment of the impact of Web Application Firewalls and Database Intrusion Detection Systems on the accuracy of SQLi testing. - An input mutation technique that can generate a diverse set of test cases. We propose a set of mutation operators that are specifically designed to increase the likelihood of generating successful attacks. - A testing technique that assesses the attack detection capabilities of a Web Application Firewall (WAF) by systematically generating attacks that try to bypass it. - An approach that increases the attack detection capabilities of a WAF by inferring a filter rule from a set of bypassing attacks. The inferred filter rule can be added to the WAF’s rule set to prevent attacks from bypassing. - An automated test oracle that is designed to meet the specific requirements of testing in an industrial context and that is independent of any specific test case generation technique...|$|R
