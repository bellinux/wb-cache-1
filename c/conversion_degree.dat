Despite extensive efforts to model such processes a consistent model {{for the design of}} a polymerization reactor has not yet been established. In this article a semiempirical model describing the <b>conversion,</b> polymerization <b>degree,</b> and molecular weight distribution (MWD) for the free radical polymerization is developed for the entire course of the reaction. The model includes the change of termination, propagation, transfer, and initiation rate. By simultaneous parameter estimation from the <b>conversion</b> and <b>degrees</b> of polymerization data the model parameters have been determined for isothermal polymerizations of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and styrene (ST). The simulation results for the <b>conversion,</b> <b>degrees</b> of polymerization, and MWD are in good accordance with experimental data for suspension and bulk polymerization of MMA and ST up to very high conversions. The influence of diffusion on the propagation rate in case of polymerization of MMA is negligible compared to the influence of the cage effect on the radical efficiency; in case of ST polymerization both effects must be included in the kinetic model. The model presented is also tested for polymerizations conducted in the presence of solvent and/or chain transfer agents...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study {{evaluated}} the variation of <b>conversion</b> <b>degree</b> (DC) in the 12 hours following initial photoactivation of a low-shrinkage composite resin (Venus Diamond). Material and Methods: The <b>conversion</b> <b>degree</b> was monitored for 12 hours using Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) F-TIR Spectroscopy. The composite {{was placed in}} 1 or 2 mm rings and cured for 10 or 20 seconds with a LED lamp. ATR spectra were acquired from the bottom surface of each sample immediately after the initial photoactivation (P= 0), 30 minutes (P= 0. 5) and 12 hours after photoactivation (P= 12) {{in order to obtain}} the DC progression during the post-curing period. Interactions between thickness (T), irradiation time (I) and post-curing (P) on the DC were calculated through ANOVA testing. Results: All the first order interactions were statistically significant, {{with the exception of the}} T-P interaction. Furthermore, the shift from P= 0 to P= 0. 5 had a statistically higher influence than the shift from P= 0. 5 to P= 12. The post-curing period played a fundamental role in reaching higher DC values with the low-shrinkage composite resin tested in this study. Moreover, both the irradiation time and the composite thickness strongly influenced the DC. Conclusions: Increased irradiation time may be useful in obtaining a high <b>conversion</b> <b>degree</b> (DC) with a low-shrinkage nano-hybrid composite resin, particularly with 2 mm composite layer...|$|E
