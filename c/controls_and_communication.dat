40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} a simple method for the automated data acquisition and analysis of data taken by programmable instruments. Device <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> method are explained and some typical illustrative examples showing the potential applications of the method in real experiments are presented. This method oers a quick and exible way to control many instruments by using a multi-device arrangement of a stacking method in a parallel operation. The General-Purpose Interface Bus (GPIB) is used here for remote control of the devices. By using Excel and Visa interactive programs and using GPIB interface, easy communication and data transfer between instruments and a PC is accomplished. A special probe system is devised for the small resistant measuring experiments and the DC resistance measurements are performed by using the four-probe method. The related temperatures are measured by using a silicone diode as a resistance thermometer detector. Using this data acquisition method, short circuit voltage measurement, resistance measurements and the temperature dependence of resistance for a thin platinum wire are reported...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Electronic sensors, {{equipment}} <b>controls,</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> protocols {{have been}} developed to meet the grow-ing interest in using center pivot and lateral move irrigation systems to deliver different irrigation depths to management zones based on previous production levels, soil texture, or topography. Onboard and field-distributed sensors can collect data necessary for real-time irrigation management decisions and transmit the information directly or through wireless networks to the main control panel or base computer. Equipment controls necessary to alter water application depth to meet the management criteria for relatively small management zones are now commercially available from irrigation system manufacturers and after-market suppliers. Communication systems such as cell phones, satellite radios, and inter-net-based systems are also available and allow the operator to query the main control panel or base computer from any location at any time. Selection of the communications system for remote access depends on local and regional topography and cost relative to other methods. Recent developments in the center pivot sprinkler industry have led to contractual rela-tionships between after-market suppliers and irrigation system manufacturers that should support further development of technologies necessary to improve the management of water, nutrient and pesticide applications. Although the primary focus of this article is center pivot sprinkler irrigation, much of the discussion could also apply to lateral move sprinkler irrigation systems...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} relationship between the Legitimate and the Shadow Systems in organisations: an interaction that can result in bringing an organisation into a state of bounded instability, and therefore increased creativity and innovation. The Legitimate System consists of the formal hierarchy, bureaucracy, rules, <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> patterns in an organisation. A properly functioning Legitimate System is vital for the conduct of business in an organisation in order to ensure its survival and efficiency. The Shadow System is a term coined by Stacey (1997) to describe the informal network of relations within the organisations that are evident in casual hallway conversations, along the grapevine, through the rumour mill and in the informal procedures for getting things done. It harbours such diversity of thought and approach that it is often the place where much of the creativity resides within an organisation. Hence, it can be a great source of innovation if leaders could learn to listen to and tap into it. Stacey proposes that when the Legitimate and Shadow Systems are at a level of optimum interaction, an organisation can sit at the Edge of Chaos or be in a state of bounded instability. In this state the organisation hovers between equilibrium and chaos and is the ideal setting in order to promote change and maximise innovation and creativity (Brown and Eisenhardt, 1997) ...|$|E

40|$|Small {{businesses}} {{have an important}} role to play in the U. S. economy. However, employee fraud can jeopardize the sustainability of small businesses. Grounded on Cressey 2 ̆ 7 s fraud triangle theory, the purpose of this multiple case study was to explore strategies used by selected managers and owners of small retail businesses to detect and prevent employee fraud. Ten participants from 5 small retail businesses participated in the study. Nine participated in a face-to-face semistructured interview, and 1 participated in a telephone interview. These participants included 5 owners and 5 managers of small retail businesses in the state of Michigan in the United States who have implemented strategies to detect and prevent employee fraud. Through a process of methodological triangulation, casual observations and documentary evidence supplemented data collected through semistructured interviews. Using thematic analysis by coding narrative segments, the research findings included themes of <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication,</b> cash register accountability, segregation of duties, monitoring, and action against perpetrators. Managers and owners of small businesses may benefit from {{the findings of this study}} by gaining awareness of the need to detect and prevent employee fraud. The implications for positive social change may include the potential to increase appropriate controls over employee fraud, thus enabling owners of small retail business an opportunity to operate effectively and efficiently, which could increase employment opportunities. Increased employment opportunities could create a positive effect on other small retail businesses and allow local communities to prosper...|$|E
40|$|The NASA Langley 8 -Foot High Temperature Tunnel {{produces}} true enthalpy environments simulating {{flight from}} Mach 4 to Mach 7, primarily for airbreathing propulsion and aerothermal/thermo-structural testing. Flow conditions are achieved through a methane-air heater and nozzles producing aerodynamic Mach numbers of 4, 5 or 7 and have exit diameters of 8 feet or 4. 5 feet. The 12 -ft long free-jet test section, housed inside a 26 -ft vacuum sphere, accommodates large test articles. Recently, the facility underwent significant upgrades to support hydrocarbon fueled scramjet engine testing and to expand flight simulation capability. The upgrades {{were required to}} meet engine system development and flight clearance verification requirements originally defined by the joint NASA-Air Force X- 43 C Hypersonic Flight Demonstrator Project and now the Air Force X- 51 A Program. Enhancements to the 8 -Ft. HTT were made in four areas: 1) hydrocarbon fuel delivery; 2) flight simulation capability; 3) controls and communication; and 4) data acquisition/processing. The upgrades include the addition of systems to supply ethylene and liquid JP- 7 to test articles; a Mach 5 nozzle with dynamic pressure simulation capability up to 3200 psf, {{the addition of a}} real-time model angle-of-attack system; a new programmable logic controller sub-system to improve process <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> with model controls; the addition of MIL-STD- 1553 B and high speed data acquisition systems and a classified data processing environment. These additions represent a significant increase to the already unique test capability and flexibility of the facility, and complement the existing array of test support hardware such as a model injection system, radiant heaters, six-component force measurement system, and optical flow field visualization hardware. The new systems support complex test programs that require sophisticated test sequences and precise management of process fluids. Furthermore, the new systems, such as the real-time angle of attack system and the new programmable logic controller enhance the test efficiency of the facility. The motivation for the upgrades and the expanded capabilities is described here...|$|E
