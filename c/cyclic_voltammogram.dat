The profiles of the depend-ent variables how that the switching process is governed by {{the availability of the}} counterion to the polypyrrole lectrode and the amount of electroactive sites. Sensitivity analysis hows that the double layer effects have more influence in the <b>cyclic</b> <b>voltammograms</b> than the electrokinetic effects.

40|$|Ferritin-immobilized poly(L-lysine) -modified {{electrodes}} showed well-defined redox waves representing ferritin. Cathodic and anodic peak currents {{obtained from}} <b>cyclic</b> <b>voltammograms</b> were proportional to potential sweep rates. From charge flow values during oxidation or reduction reactions calculated by peak areas in <b>cyclic</b> <b>voltammograms,</b> {{and the surface}} coverage of ferritin, reacted iron atoms per ferritin molecule were calculated. Obtained numbers of reacted iron atoms were significantly smaller than expected values from iron atoms at ferrihydrite core surfaces of ferritin, which would be caused by the rate-determining ion flow through ion channels of ferritin to compensate for charges in the ferritin cavity. Anodic and cathodic peak potentials in <b>cyclic</b> <b>voltammograms</b> were significantly dependent on cationic species in the solution, though voltammetric shapes and peak currents were independent of cations. From the obtained results that structural changes in ferritin were not detected by fluorescent spectra, {{it is thought that}} the cationic dependence on ferritin redox peak potentials is caused by ferritin cores...|$|R
50|$|Pseudocapacitance {{properties}} can {{be expressed}} in a <b>cyclic</b> <b>voltammogram.</b> For an ideal double-layer capacitor, the current flow is reversed immediately upon reversing the potential yielding a rectangular-shaped of the voltammogram, with a current independent of the electrode potential. For double-layer capacitors with resistive losses, the shape changes to a parallelogram. In faradaic electrodes the electrical charge {{stored in the capacitor}} is strongly dependent on the potential, therefore, the voltammetry characteristics deviate from the parallelogram due to a delay while reversing the potential, ultimately coming from kinetic charging processes.|$|E
50|$|Cyclic voltammetry (CV) {{is a type}} of potentiodynamic {{electrochemical}} measurement. In a {{cyclic voltammetry}} experiment, the working electrode potential is ramped linearly versus time. Unlike in linear sweep voltammetry, after the set potential is reached in a CV experiment, the working electrode's potential is ramped in the opposite direction to return to the initial potential. These cycles of ramps in potential may be repeated as many times as needed. The current at the working electrode is plotted versus the applied voltage (that is, the working electrode's potential) to give the <b>cyclic</b> <b>voltammogram</b> trace. Cyclic voltammetry is generally used to study the electrochemical properties of an analyte in solution.|$|E
50|$|The {{current is}} sampled at two times - {{once at the}} end of the forward {{potential}} pulse and again {{at the end of}} the reverse potential pulse (in both cases immediately before the potential direction is reversed). As a result of this current sampling technique, the contribution to the current signal resulting from capacitive (sometimes referred to as non-faradaic or charging) current is minimal. As a result of having current sampling at two different instances per squarewave cycle, two current waveforms are collected - both have diagnostic value, and are therefore preserved. When viewed in isolation, the forward and reverse current waveforms mimic the appearance of a <b>cyclic</b> <b>voltammogram</b> (which corresponds to the anodic or cathodic halves, however, is dependent upon experimental conditions).|$|E

An expanded version of Fick’s Second Law is used to account for a diffusion coefficient that varies with x, distance normal to the electrode surface. Parameters to define the slope and magnitude of a linearly graded diffusion profile are described. A one dimensional explicit finite difference simulation method is used and parameters are made to be dimensionless. The simulation is vetted by comparison with Nicholson and Shain simulations and determination of the resolution limits. Morphological changes in <b>cyclic</b> <b>voltammograms</b> are observed that indicate an approach to steady state diffusion...|$|R
50|$|The {{shape of}} the semiintegral {{can be used as}} an easy method to measure the amount of ohmic drop of an {{electrochemical}} cell in cyclic voltammetry. Essentially the semiintegral of a <b>cyclic</b> <b>voltammogram</b> at a planar electrode (an electrode that obeys to the rules of planar diffusion) has the shape of a sigmoid while the original data is gauss-sigmoid convoluted. This enables the operator to optimize parameters necessary for positive feedback compensation in an easy manor. If ohmic drop distortion is present the two sigmoids for the forward and the backward scan are far away from congruence, the ohmic drop can be calculated from the deviation from congruence in these cases. In the example shown slight distortion is present, yet this does not have adverse effects on data quality.|$|E
50|$|The G1 {{algorithm}} {{produces a}} numerical derivative {{that has the}} shape of a bell curve, this derivative obeys to certain laws, for example the G1 derivative of a <b>cyclic</b> <b>voltammogram</b> is mirrored at the abscissa as long as the electrochemical reaction is diffusion controlled, the planar diffusion approximation {{can be applied to the}} electrode geometry and ohmic drop distortion is minimal. The FWHM of the curve is approximately 100 mV for a system that behaves in the described manor. The maximum is found at the value of the formal potential, this is quivalent to the 1.5th order semiderivative hitting the abszissa at this potential. Moreover the semiderivative scales linearly with the scanrate, while the current scales linearly with the square root of the scanrate (Randles-Sevcik equation). Plotting the semiderivatives produced at different scanrates gives a family of curves that are linearly related by the scanrate quotient in an ideal system.|$|E
50|$|Potential sweep {{reversals}} {{as used in}} {{cyclic voltammetry}} are different for a RDE system, since {{the products of the}} potential sweep are continually swept away from the electrode. A reversal would produce a similar i-E curve, which would closely match the forward scan, except for capacitive charging current. A RDE cannot be used to observe the behavior of the electrode reaction products, since they are continually swept away from the electrode. However, the rotating ring-disk electrode is well suited to investigate this further reactivity. The peak current in a <b>cyclic</b> <b>voltammogram</b> for a RDE is a plateau like region, governed by the Levich Equation. The limiting current is typically much higher than the peak current of a stationary electrode, being that the mass transport of reactants is actively stimulated by the rotating disk, and not just governed by diffusion, as is the case for a stationary electrode. Any rotating disk electrode can, of course, also be used as a stationary electrode by using it with the rotator turned off.|$|E

The cyclic voltammetry was performed for both the nanowire and nanofibril arrays to investigate their electrochemical properties. The influences of the scan rate, different scan cycles and the micro morphologies on the <b>cyclic</b> <b>voltammograms</b> were investigated. The results show that polyaniline nanowire and nanofibril arrays present quite different <b>cyclic</b> <b>voltammograms.</b> These differences are ascribed to the various micro-morphologies and ordering state.
