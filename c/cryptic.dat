5|$|When {{stalking}} any non-salticid, P. fimbriata {{does not}} use <b>cryptic</b> stalking and does not consistently pull its palps back nor consistently freeze when faced by the prey. P. fimbriata adopts <b>cryptic</b> stalking only after recognizing prey as a jumping spider.|$|E

5|$|P. fimbriata {{does not}} stalk at all {{species of the}} ant-mimic jumping spider genus Myrmarachne, and uses <b>cryptic</b> {{stalking}} only about 20% of the time against other ant-mimicking salticids and against beetle-mimicking salticids. P. fimbriata also sometimes does not use <b>cryptic</b> stalking against females of the salticid subfamily Lyssomaninae. These females are unusually translucent, and the translucent cuticle makes the anterior-median eyes (front-and-center) show light and dark regions that flicker in and out when viewed head on. Lyssomanine males are not translucent and do not produce this flickering, and P. fimbriata uses <b>cryptic</b> stalking consistently against the males. This suggests that the flickering anterior-median eyes of lyssomanine females may reduce the ability of P. fimbriata to identify these females as jumping spiders.|$|E
5|$|The {{outlines}} of an animal's body {{can be made}} hard to see by other methods, such as by using a highly irregular outline. For example, the comma butterfly, Polygonia c-album, is highly <b>cryptic</b> when its wings are closed, with <b>cryptic</b> colours, disruptive pattern, and irregular outer margins to the wings.|$|E
5|$|A genetic {{study in}} 2012 found clear {{differences}} between various {{populations of the}} Cuvier's dwarf caiman (Pantanal; Madeira River basin; Rio Negro basin) and these are apparently isolated from each others, leading to the suggestion {{that it may be}} a <b>cryptic</b> species complex.|$|E
5|$|A {{small family}} of medium to large waders with strong black bills, large yellow eyes and <b>cryptic</b> plumage. There are 9 species worldwide, with one {{recorded}} in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|Bungie first {{introduced}} the Halo series publicly in 1999 by sending the Cortana Letters, {{a series of}} <b>cryptic</b> email messages, to the maintainer of marathon.bungie.org, a fan site for one of Bungie's previous series, the Marathon Trilogy. The strategic use of <b>cryptic</b> messages in a publicity campaign was repeated in I Love Bees, a promotion for Halo 2. Although Bungie does not consider most of the letters to be canon, Cortana speaks {{many of the same}} lines in Halo 3. According to C. J. Cowan, Bungie's director of cinematics, the studio used the character here to give story clues without actually revealing the story.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cryptic</b> Studios and Perfect World Entertainment have {{announced}} plans to create a Magic: The Gathering massively multiplayer online role-playing game, to be released for personal computers and consoles.|$|E
5|$|Earlier ornithologists {{felt that}} the kakapo {{might be related to}} the ground parrots and night parrot of Australia due to their similar colouration, but this is contradicted by recent studies; rather, the <b>cryptic</b> colour seems to be {{adaptation}} to terrestrial habits that evolved twice convergently.|$|E
5|$|If disturbed, most Portia species leap upwards about 100 to 150millimetres, {{often from}} the <b>cryptic</b> rest pose, and often {{over a wide}} trajectory. Usually Portia then either freezes or runs about 100millimetres and then freezes. However, P. fimbriata in Queensland rarely runs or leaps.|$|E
5|$|In Britain, {{separate}} bodies administer each order. Freemasons {{are encouraged}} to join the Holy Royal Arch, which is linked to Mark Masonry in Scotland and Ireland, but separate in England. Templar and <b>Cryptic</b> Masonry also exist.|$|E
5|$|Many {{tropical}} butterflies have seasonal {{forms for}} dry and wet seasons. These are switched by the hormone ecdysone. The dry-season forms are usually more <b>cryptic,</b> perhaps offering better camouflage when vegetation is scarce. Dark colours in wet-season forms {{may help to}} absorb solar radiation.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{studies have}} shown that, in its current circumscription, the genus Hydnellum is polyphyletic and only distantly related to the white-spored genera Bankera and Phellodon, {{currently}} grouped together in the family Bankeraceae. Analyses of the ITS region by Parfitt and colleagues and Ainsworth and colleagues, have further revealed multiple <b>cryptic</b> lineages within the genus. Most of the <b>cryptic</b> species belong to the H. concrescens/H. scrobiculatum species complex, resulting in frequent misinterpretations of these old and widely applied names. At the moment, the number of phylogenetically distinct lineages confirmed by molecular sequencing exceeds the number of described taxa in the genus, making further taxonomic revisions inevitable in the future.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies have}} found some {{traditional}} Russulaceae species to comprise several <b>cryptic</b> species (see Systematics and taxonomy: Species diversity). This may imply that distribution range and population size for each of such distinct species are smaller than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|Since {{producers}} {{search for}} food and scroungers wait for opportunities to join, prey crypsis imposes a producer specific cost that shifts the producer scrounger equilibria towards more scrounging. Prey crypsis resulted in increased latency to eat the seed and increased number of detection errors. Moreover, {{the presence of a}} competitor negatively affected foraging efficiency under cyptic backgrounds. The foraging efficiency of individuals that had previously foraged with a competitor on <b>cryptic</b> seeds remained low even after the competitor had been removed. Thus, the costs of foraging on <b>cryptic</b> prey may be greater for social foragers than for solitary foragers.|$|E
5|$|The {{description}} of what happens next is deliberately <b>cryptic.</b> Lucius reminds the reader that the uninitiated {{are not allowed to}} know the details of the mystery rites, before describing his experience in vague terms.|$|E
5|$|The stone-curlews are a {{group of}} nine species of largely {{tropical}} and nocturnal birds. They are characterised by their strong black or yellow-black bills, large yellow eyes and <b>cryptic</b> plumage. One species is a vagrant to Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|When disturbed, most leap upwards about 100 to 150mm, {{often from}} the <b>cryptic</b> rest pose, and often {{over a wide}} trajectory. Usually Portia then either freezes or runs about 100mm and then freezes.|$|E
5|$|A second {{species of}} Voalavo, eastern voalavo, was named in 2005 from central Madagascar. Morphological {{differences}} between the two are subtle but consistent, and the cytochrome b sequences of the two species differ by about 10%. In mammals, closely related species regularly differ by less than 5% in their cytochrome b sequences, and a divergence of more than 5% within a single species suggests the presence of <b>cryptic</b> species.|$|E
5|$|All tiger sharks {{generally}} swim slowly, which, {{combined with}} <b>cryptic</b> coloration, may make them difficult for prey to detect in some habitats. They are especially well camouflaged against dark backgrounds. Despite their sluggish appearance, tiger sharks {{are one of}} the strongest swimmers of the carcharhinid sharks. Once the shark has come close, a speed burst allows it to reach the intended prey before it can escape.|$|E
5|$|Among moths with deimatic behaviour, the {{eyed hawkmoth}} (Smerinthus ocellatus) {{displays}} its large eyespots, moving them slowly {{as if it}} were a vertebrate predator such as an owl. Among butterflies, the peacock butterfly Aglais io is a <b>cryptic</b> leaf mimic with wings closed, but displays 4 conspicuous eyespots when disturbed, in a display effective against insectivorous birds (flycatchers).|$|E
5|$|Aposematic species do {{not need}} to hide or stay still as <b>cryptic</b> organisms do, so aposematic {{individuals}} benefit from more freedom in exposed areas and can spend more time foraging, allowing them to find more and better quality food. Aposematic individuals can similarly make use of conspicuous mating displays.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{the books}} of Griffiths (1996) and Jehle et al. (2011), with {{additions}} from articles on recently recognised species. NRBV = number of rib-bearing vertebrae, values from Wielstra & Arntzen (2011). Triturus anatolicus, T. ivanbureschi and T. karelinii are <b>cryptic</b> species and have only been separated through genetic analysis.|$|E
5|$|Drizzt {{has also}} {{been seen in the}} game known as Neverwinter Online by <b>Cryptic</b> Studios. He appears after {{achieving}} level 60 in one of the stories to aid king Bruenor Battlehammer in his quest to take back the dwarven throne for himself in the regions of MT. Gauntlegrym.|$|E
5|$|F. rubiginosa is {{exclusively}} pollinated in {{a symbiotic}} relationship with Pleistodontes imperialis, a species of fig wasp. Biologist Eleanor Haine and colleagues analysed the DNA of the wasp across the fig's range and determined four <b>cryptic</b> lineages forming what they term the P. imperialis species complex. They diverge {{to a greater degree}} than some distinct wasp species, yet form a monophyletic group; this indicates that the wasp lineages have split without a change of host.|$|E
5|$|Historian Brian Jones concludes in The Emperor Domitian that {{assessing}} {{the true nature}} of Domitian's personality is inherently complicated by the bias of the surviving sources. Common threads nonetheless emerge from the available evidence. He appears to have lacked the natural charisma of his brother and father. He was prone to suspicion, displayed an odd, sometimes self-deprecating sense of humour, and often communicated in <b>cryptic</b> ways.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to RNA processing, turnover and surveillance activities, the exosome {{is important for}} the degradation of so-called <b>cryptic</b> unstable transcripts (CUTs) that are produced from thousands of loci within the yeast genome. The importance of these unstable RNAs and their degradation are still unclear, but similar RNA species have also been detected in human cells.|$|E
5|$|New {{species in}} the Russulaceae {{continue}} to be described from various regions, such as the US, Guyana, Brazil, Patagonia, Togo, Sri Lanka, or Thailand. It {{has been estimated that}} the real number of Russula species in North America alone (currently around 400 described) might be as high as 2000. <b>Cryptic</b> species may increase true diversity: some morphologically well-defined species, especially in Lactifluus, have been shown to actually encompass several phylogenetic species.|$|E
5|$|Poison dart frog (also {{known as}} dart-poison frog, poison frog or {{formerly}} known as poison arrow frog) is the common name {{of a group of}} frogs in the family Dendrobatidae which are native to tropical Central and South America. These species are diurnal and often have brightly colored bodies. This bright coloration is correlated with the toxicity of the species, making them aposematic. Some species of the family Dendrobatidae exhibit extremely bright coloration along with high toxicity, while others have <b>cryptic</b> coloration with minimal to no amount of observed toxicity. The species that have great toxicity derive this from their diet of ants, mites and termites. Other species however, that exhibit <b>cryptic</b> coloration and low to no amounts of toxicity, eat a much larger variety of prey. Many species of this family are threatened due to human infrastructure encroaching the places they inhabit.|$|E
5|$|Potamon fluviatile is at {{the western}} {{distributional}} limit of the genus Potamon. Other species in the genus occur through Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and across Central Asia as far east as northwestern India. The populations of P.fluviatile on the Peloponnese, Kefalonia, and Zakynthos may represent a separate, <b>cryptic</b> species, and the population from the Peloponnese was described in 2010 as P.pelops.|$|E
5|$|Some noctuid moths, such as {{the large}} red underwing (Catocala nupta), are <b>cryptic</b> at rest, but display a flash of startlingly bright colours when disturbed. Others, such as many species of genus Speiredonia and Spirama, look {{threatening}} while at rest. Also saturniid moths of the genera Attacus and Rothschildia display snake heads, but not from the frontal position.|$|E
5|$|The Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite is {{a system}} of 33 degrees (including the three Blue Lodge degrees) {{administered}} by a local or national Supreme Council. This system is popular in North America and in Continental Europe. The York Rite, with a similar range, administers three orders of Masonry, namely the Royal Arch, <b>Cryptic</b> Masonry and Knights Templar.|$|E
5|$|The stone-curlews are a {{group of}} largely {{tropical}} waders in the family Burhinidae. They are found worldwide within the tropical zone, with some species also breeding in temperate Europe and Australia. They are medium to large waders with strong black or yellow-black bills, large yellow eyes and <b>cryptic</b> plumage. Despite being classed as waders, most species have a preference for arid or semi-arid habitats.|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} 1993 by Segawa et al. {{revealed}} that the population of S.lessoniana in Okinawa may actually be composed of three distinct species. This was confirmed in genetic studies by Izuka et al. in 1994. Triantafillos and Adams in 2005 also showed that S.lessoniana in Shark Bay, Australia is composed of two species. These findings indicate that S.lessoniana may actually comprise several very similar and closely related species. It is now believed that S.lessoniana is a <b>cryptic</b> species complex.|$|E
5|$|Crypsis, or the {{inability}} of humans to visually distinguish between two or more distinct species, has recently been discovered among lemurs, particularly within the sportive lemurs (Lepilemur) and mouse lemurs (Microcebus). With sportive lemurs, subspecies were traditionally defined based on slight morphological differences, but new genetic evidence has supported giving full species status to these regional populations. In the case of mouse lemurs, the gray mouse lemur (M. murinus), golden-brown mouse lemur (M. ravelobensis), and Goodman's mouse lemur (M. lehilahytsara) were considered the same species until recently, when genetic tests identified them as <b>cryptic</b> species.|$|E
5|$|His vocal {{style has}} varied from a screaming, yowling {{delivery}} as lead vocalist of the Pixies {{to a more}} measured and melodic style in his solo career. His <b>cryptic</b> lyrics mostly explore unconventional subjects, such as surrealism, incest and biblical violence, along with science fiction and surf culture. His use of atypical meter signatures, loud–quiet dynamics and distinct preference for live-to-two-track recording in {{his career as a}} solo artist give him a distinct style within alternative rock.|$|E
