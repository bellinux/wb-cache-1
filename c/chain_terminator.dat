40|$|Nonobligate <b>chain</b> <b>terminators,</b> such as 2 ′-C-methylated nucleotides, block RNA {{synthesis}} by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) {{of hepatitis}} C virus (HCV). Previous studies with related viral polymerases {{have shown that}} classical <b>chain</b> <b>terminators</b> lacking the 3 ′-hydroxyl group can be excised {{in the presence of}} pyrophosphate (PPi), which is detrimental to the inhibitory activity of these compounds. Here we demonstrate that the HCV RdRp enzyme is capable of removing both obligate and clinically relevant nonobligate <b>chain</b> <b>terminators.</b> Pyrimidines are more efficiently excised than are purines. The presence of the next complementary templated nucleotide literally blocks the excision of obligate <b>chain</b> <b>terminators</b> through the formation of a dead-end complex (DEC). However, 2 ′-C-methylated CMP is still cleaved efficiently under these conditions. These findings show that a 2 ′-methylated primer terminus impedes nucleotide binding. The S 282 T mutation, associated with resistance to 2 ′-C-methylated nucleotides, does not affect the excision patterns. Thus, the decreased susceptibility to 2 ′-C-methylated nucleotides appears to be based solely on improved discrimination between the inhibitor and its natural counterpart. In conclusion, our data suggest that the phosphorolytic excision of nonobligate, pyrimidine-based <b>chain</b> <b>terminators</b> can diminish their potency. The templated nucleotide does not appear to provide protection from excision through DEC formation...|$|R
40|$|Nucleoside or {{nucleotide}} analogue inhibitors of {{viral replication}} almost act as <b>chain</b> <b>terminators</b> during DNA (DNA- and retroviruses) or RNA (RNA viruses) synthesis. Following intracellular phosphorylation, by viral and/or cellular kinases, the 5 '-triphosphate metabolites (or 2 '-diphosphate metabolites {{in the case}} of acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analogues) compete with the natural substrate in the DNA or RNA polymerization reaction. Obligatory <b>chain</b> <b>terminators</b> (e. g., acyclovir) do not offer the 3 '-hydroxyl function at the riboside moiety of the molecule. Nucleoside analogues that possess a hydroxyl function at a position equivalent of the 3 '-hydroxyl position may act as <b>chain</b> <b>terminators</b> if this hydroxyl group is conformationally constrained (e. g., ganciclovir) or sterically hindered to enter into a phosphodiester linkage with the incoming nucleotide. In case that the 3 '-hydroxylgroup is correctly positioned, chain elongation may be hampered through steric hindrance from neighboring substituents (e. g., 2 '-C-methyl or 4 '-azido nucleoside inhibitors of HCV replication). Here, we review the molecular mechanism of action and the clinical applications of the nucleosides and nucleotides acting as <b>chain</b> <b>terminators.</b> A further discussion of clinical applications in combination therapy can be found in Chap. 12. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Didanosine (ddI) is a {{nucleoside}} analogue of adenosine.

50|$|Lamivudine is an {{analogue}} of cytidine. It can inhibit {{both types}} (1 and 2) of HIV reverse transcriptase {{and also the}} reverse transcriptase of hepatitis B virus. It is phosphorylated to active metabolites that compete for incorporation into viral DNA. They inhibit the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme competitively and act as a <b>chain</b> <b>terminator</b> of DNA synthesis.

50|$|Sofosbuvir is a prodrug. It is metabolized to {{the active}} {{antiviral}} agent GS-461203 (2'-deoxy-2'-α-fluoro-β-C-methyluridine-5'-triphosphate).

This process {{is accomplished by}} the virus-coded reverse transcriptase (RT) protein, which is a primary target in the current treatments for HIV- 1 infection. In particular, in the approved therapeutic regimens two classes of drugs target RT, namely, nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs) and nonnucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs). Both classes inhibit the RT-associated polymerase activity: the NRTIs compete with the natural dNTP substrate and act as <b>chain</b> <b>terminators,</b> while the NNRTIs bind to an allosteric pocket and inhibit polymerization noncompetitively. In addition to these two classes, other RT inhibitors (RTIs) that target RT by distinct mechanisms have been identified and are currently under development.

50|$|In 1964 {{zidovudine}} (AZT) was synthesized by Horwitz at the Michigan Cancer Foundation. The 3´hydroxyl {{group in}} the deoxyribose ring of thymidine is replaced by an azido group which gives us zidovudine. The lack of the 3´hydroxyl group which provides the attachment point for the next nucleotide in the growing DNA chain during the reverse transcription makes it an obligate <b>chain</b> <b>terminator.</b> Ziduvodine is incorporated in place of thymidine and is an extremely potent inhibitor of HIV replication. This compound had been prepared in 1964 as a potential anti-cancer agent but was shown to be ineffective. In 1974 zidovudine {{was reported to have}} activity against retroviruses and was subsequently re-screened as an antiviral when the AIDS epidemic hit Western societies during themid 1980‘s. However, ziduvodine is relatively toxic since it is converted into thetriphosphate by the cellular enzymes and therefore it is activated in uninfected cells.|$|E
50|$|In <b>chain</b> <b>terminator</b> {{sequencing}} (Sanger sequencing), extension is initiated at {{a specific}} site on the template DNA by using a short oligonucleotide 'primer' complementary to the template at that region. The oligonucleotide primer is extended using a DNA polymerase, an enzyme that replicates DNA. Included with the primer and DNA polymerase are the four deoxynucleotide bases (DNA building blocks), along with a low concentration of a chain terminating nucleotide (most commonly a di-deoxynucleotide). Limited incorporation of the chain terminating nucleotide by the DNA polymerase results {{in a series of}} related DNA fragments that are terminated only at positions where that particular nucleotide is used. The fragments are then size-separated by electrophoresis in a slab polyacrylamide gel, or more commonly now, in a narrow glass tube (capillary) filled with a viscous polymer.An alternative to the labelling of the primer is to label the terminators instead, commonly called 'dye terminator sequencing'. The major advantage of this approach is the complete sequencing set can be performed in a single reaction, rather than the four needed with the labeled-primer approach. This is accomplished by labelling each of the dideoxynucleotide chain-terminators with a separate fluorescent dye, which fluoresces at a different wavelength. This method is easier and quicker than the dye primer approach, but may produce more uneven data peaks (different heights), due to a template dependent difference in the incorporation of the large dye chain-terminators. This problem has been significantly reduced with the introduction of new enzymes and dyes that minimize incorporation variability.This method is now used {{for the vast majority of}} sequencing reactions as it is both simpler and cheaper. The major reason for this is that the primers do not have to be separately labelled (which can be a significant expense for a single-use custom primer), although this is less of a concern with frequently used 'universal' primers. This is changing rapidly due to the increasing cost-effectiveness of second- and third-generation systems from Illumina, 454, ABI, Helicos, and Dover.|$|E

40|$|We biochemically {{simulated}} HIV- 1 DNA polymerization in physiological nucleotide pools {{found in}} two HIV- 1 target cell types: terminally differentiated/non-dividing macrophages and activated/dividing CD 4 + T cells. Quantitative tandem mass spectrometry shows that macrophages harbor 22 – 320 -fold lower dNTP concentrations {{and a greater}} disparity between ribonucleoside triphosphate (rNTP) and dNTP concentrations than dividing target cells. A biochemical simulation of HIV- 1 reverse transcription revealed that rNTPs are efficiently incorporated into DNA in the macrophage {{but not in the}} T cell environment. This implies that HIV- 1 incorporates rNTPs during viral replication in macrophages and also predicts that rNTP <b>chain</b> <b>terminators</b> lacking a 3 ′-OH should inhibit HIV- 1 reverse transcription in macrophages. Indeed, 3 ′-deoxyadenosine inhibits HIV- 1 proviral DNA synthesis in human macrophages more efficiently than in CD 4 + T cells.

40|$|The nucleotide-binding site in {{a variety}} of DNA polymerases was probed by {{analyzing}} incorporation of dideoxy and acyclic chain terminators. Family B archaeon DNA polymerases Vent, Deep Vent, 9 °N and Pfu incorporated acyclic in preference to dideoxy terminators, while the Family A DNA polymerases Taq and Klenow preferred dideoxy terminators. These divergent biases suggest that significant differences exist in sugar recognition in these two classes of polymerases. Mutants of Vent (A 488 L) and Taq (F 667 Y) that increase incorporation of dideoxy terminators maintained the acyclic/dideoxy bias of the parent enzyme, while more efficiently incorporating both dideoxy and acyclic terminators. The preference of archaeon DNA polymerases for acyclic analogs was exploited in <b>chain</b> <b>terminator</b> DNA sequence and genotype analysis. This technology was additionally aided by identification of specific dye-modified bases that improve terminator incorporation over that of the unmodified terminator. These three enhancing effects, (i) acyclic analogs, (ii) archaeon variants and (iii) specific dyes, appear to act additively and independently to increase terminator incorporation efficiency, collectively enhancing incorporation ∼ 8000 -fold over the wild-type incorporation of dideoxynucleotides.
