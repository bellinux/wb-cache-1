This {{is a form of}} biological control known as habitat augmentation, but achieved with the use of cover crops (Bugg and Waddington 1994). Findings on the relationship between cover crop presence and predator/pest population dynamics have been mixed, pointing toward the need for detailed information on specific cover crop types and management practices to best complement a given integrated pest management strategy. For example, the predator mite Euseius tularensis (Congdon) is known to help control the pest <b>citrus</b> <b>thrips</b> in Central California citrus orchards. Researchers found that the planting of several different leguminous cover crops (such as bell bean, woollypod vetch, New Zealand white clover, and Austrian winter pea) provided sufficient pollen as a feeding source to cause a seasonal increase in E. tularensis populations, which with good timing could potentially introduce enough predatory pressure to reduce pest populations of <b>citrus</b> <b>thrips</b> (Grafton-Cardwell et al. 1999).|$|E
40|$|<b>Citrus</b> <b>thrips,</b> Scirtothrips citri (Moulton), is a plant-feeding pest {{most widely}} {{recognized}} for damage caused to citrus and mango fruits. <b>Citrus</b> <b>thrips</b> have {{also become a}} significant pest in California's blueberries. Avocado thrips, Scirtothrips perseae Nakahara, is a pest of avocados (Persea americana Mill. [Lauraceae]) in California. Pesticides are often used to manage these two species of thrips and therefore, the likelihood of resistance development is high. There is increasing pressure in the United States {{to move away from}} broad-spectrum insecticides and focus on alternative methods of control, e. g., genetically modified crop plants expressing Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) toxins, use of biorational insecticides such as toxic Bt protein sprays and entomopathogens (such as various strains of Beauveria bassiana Balsamo, and other agents). Integrated pest management programs are essential for any agricultural commodity. The goal of the work described here is to add to the foundation of knowledge to improve the integrated pest management of <b>citrus</b> <b>thrips</b> and avocado thrips. The research conducted for this disseration 1) examined alternatives to traditional insecticides (Bt protein sprays and several strains of B. bassiana) to control both avocado and <b>citrus</b> <b>thrips</b> in the laboratory and resulted in no efficacy of the Bts tested but one strain of fungus, the commercially available strain was able to infect <b>citrus</b> <b>thrips</b> at field obtainable levels, 2) tested the commercially available strain in different formulations and water regimes against <b>citrus</b> <b>thrips</b> in blueberry fields which resulted in some control but not enough to strongly recommend this as an alternative to traditional pesticides, 3) evaluated the impact of some of the insecticides registered for avocado thrips management on the beneficial native predaceous mite Euseius hibisci Chant in avocado orchards and found that each of the pesticides harmed the mite but at varying levels and durations, 4) assessed <b>citrus</b> <b>thrips</b> oviposition on blueberry varieties with choice and no-choice tests and it was determined that <b>citrus</b> <b>thrips</b> likely oviposit to differing degrees in some plants over others, and finally 5) determined that <b>citrus</b> <b>thrips</b> in the Americas was actually a complex of species that were nearly morphologically identical but molecularly quite distinct...|$|E

40|$|Mealybugs (Planococcus citri) and thrips (Scirtothrips aurantii) {{are common}} and {{extremely}} damaging citrus crop pests which have proven {{difficult to control}} via conventional methods, such as chemical pesticides and insect growth regulators. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the efficacy of entomopathogenic fungi against these pests in laboratory bioassays. Isolates of Metarhizium anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana from citrus orchards in the Eastern Cape, South Africa were maintained on Sabouraud Dextrose 4 % Agar supplemented with Dodine, chloramphenicol and rifampicin at 25 °C. Infectivity of the fungal isolates was initially assessed using 5 th instar false codling moth, Thaumatotibia leucotreta, larvae. Mealybug bioassays were performed in 24 well plates using 1 x 107 ml- 1 conidial suspensions and kept at 26 °C for 5 days with a photoperiod of 12 L: 12 D. A Beauveria commercial product and an un-inoculated control were also screened for comparison. Isolates GAR 17 B 3 (B. bassiana) and FCM AR 23 B 3 (M. anisopliae) both resulted in 67. 5 % mealybug crawler mortality and GB AR 23 13 3 (B. bassiana) resulted in 64 % crawler mortality. These 3 isolates were further tested in dose-dependent assays. Probit analyses were conducted on the dose-dependent assays data using PROBAN to determine LC₅₀ values. For both the mealybug adult and crawlers FCM AR 23 B 3 required the lowest concentration to achieve LC₅₀ at 4. 96 x 10 ⁶ conidia ml- 1 and 5. 29 x 10 ⁵ conidia ml- 1, respectively. Bioassays on adult thrips were conducted in munger cells with leaf buds inoculated with the conidial suspensions. Isolate GAR 17 B 3 had the highest mortality rate at 70 % on thrips while FCM AR 23 B 3 resulted in 60 % mortality. Identification of the isolates, FCM AR 23 B 3, GAR 17 B 3 and GB AR 23 13 3, were confirmed to be correct using both microscopic and molecularly techniques. ITS sequences were compared to other sequences from GenBank and confirmed phylogenetically using MEGA 6. Mealybug infection was investigated using scanning electron microscopy, mycosis was confirmed but the infection process could not be followed due to the extensive waxy cuticle. These results indicate that there is potential for the isolates FCM AR 23 B 3 and GAR 17 B 3 to be developed as biological control agents for the control of <b>citrus</b> mealybug and <b>thrips.</b> Further research would be required to determine their ability to perform under field conditions...|$|R

However with leaf dip bioassays, a 3 -fold difference, although statistically significant, is usually inconsequential. Success was the only insecticide that demonstrated a noteworthy difference in toxicity to nymphs compared to adults in the bioassay; it was 45 times more toxic to the nymphs than to the adults. Based on X 2 contingency tables, lemon trees treated with Carzol, Success, or Baythroid all had significantly lower percentages of nymphs relative to the untreated control.

40|$|A pest species (Scirtothrips aurantii (Faure´)), the South African <b>citrus</b> <b>thrips,</b> {{established}} adventitiously in Australia on a weed of biocontrol interest. Investigations {{centered on}} this ‘‘natural experiment’’, reveal that potentially effective biocontrol {{agents in the}} form of host specialist species are currently being overlooked. South African <b>citrus</b> <b>thrips</b> is considered highly polyphagous in Africa, on plants ranging from citrus (Rutaceae) to mango (Anacardiaceae), but in Australia the thrips included in this taxon are restricted to the genus Bryophyllum (Crassulaceae). Choice tests conducted in flight cages on the Australian population of S. aurantii demonstrate they do not infest orange plants (Citrus sinensis) or kumquat nagami (Fortunella margarita), settle occasionally on mango (Magnifera indica), but readily settle on Bryophyllum delagoense (Eckl. & Zeyh) and establish colonies. When confined to each of these hosts, reproduction is successful only on B. delagoense. Although nymphs are occasionally produced on young red mango leaves, mortality of the nymphs and the few resulting adults is complete and no further eggs are oviposited. Results demonstrate the thrips in Australia are likely to remain exclusively on plants of the genus Bryophyllum, although they may occur occasionally and sporadically on flushing leaves of mango. Sampling demonstrated S. aurantii causes significant damage to B. delagoense, both reproductively and structurally. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of understanding the species status of the Australian population of S. aurantii, the potential biocontrol applications of this insect, and the conceptual background to the selection of potential biological control agents for prerelease screening...|$|E

Despite the prolonged blooming and petal drop period experienced during this trial, plots receiving pre-petal fall applications of Acetamiprid did not produce higher quality fruit than treatments where applications began following petal fall. The fact that thrips densities were low during this period may be the reason. Before pre-petal fall insecticide applications can be deemed useful and economically justifiable, evaluations must be made at higher thrips infestation levels...|$|E

Both Lorsban and Dimethoate provided good initial thrips control but were short lived. Lorsban appeared to have a slightly longer residual than Dimethoate. Both of the pyrethroids, Baythroid and Danitol, performed poorly. Neither provided good thrips knockdown or residual control. Pyrethroids should be avoided for thrips control when temperatures equal or exceed 95 °F. We {{were not able to}} demonstrate any adverse effect on efficacy towards thrips by acidifying Success.

40|$|A small plot {{trial was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the benefit of applying insecticides for <b>citrus</b> <b>thrips</b> management pre-petal fall.

However, in situations where fruit is present and petal fall has not fully occurred, these applications may be useful to protect these fruit. Of the acute toxicants evaluated pre-petal fall (Assail and Success), Assail appeared to be the best choice. However, if temperatures are approaching 95 °F, Assail should be avoided. Pre-petal fall applications of Surround and Snow are beneficial in respect that several applications of these products may be required to obtain adequate coverage, and by making these applications during the pre-petal fall period, thrips can be managed before many susceptible fruit are present...|$|E

40|$|Two small plot {{efficacy}} {{trials were}} conducted evaluating different insecticide rotation regimes using commercially available insecticides {{and the effectiveness}} of new insecticide chemistries to control <b>citrus</b> <b>thrips.</b> Under the consistently cool conditions experienced during the first four weeks of the trial, Dimethoate, Success, Baythroid, Agri-Mek, Vydate and Carzol all of the offered adequate control and would fit well in the petal fall window. This is in contrast with previous years experiences when high temperatures within a week of petal fall would result in all treatments except Carzol requiring a re-treatment within ten days. All of the rotation schemes evaluated required three insecticide applications to get through the season, and {{did not appear to be}} greatly different in controlling thrips and producing high quality fruit under the environmental conditions experienced. However, the Dimethoate - Success - Baythroid rotation scheme was most cost effective. When temperatures were in the 70 's to low 80 's, Dimethoate and Vydate offered about three weeks control, Success, Carzol, Baythroid and Agri-Mek all offered about four weeks control. When temperatures were in the mid to upper 80 's and low to mid 90 's, Success provided about three weeks control while Carzol didn t require re-treatment for 4 weeks. Under these same temperature conditions, Dimethoate and Vydate gave about 7 to 12 days control, and Agri-Mek provided 12 to 14 days of control. Other than the one control failure with Baythroid, under warmer conditions, it provided about seven days control. In the experimentals test, AZEXP 1 appeared to offer knockdown activity at temperatures less than 90 F, and only suppression at higher temperatures. AZEXP 2, appeared to be a viable <b>citrus</b> <b>thrips</b> material, with activity similar to Success and Carzol.

40|$|The South African <b>Citrus</b> <b>Thrips,</b> Scirtothrips aurantii Faure (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) {{has been}} a serious pest of the citrus {{industry}} of Southern Africa for over 70 years. It is indigenous to Africa and has no recorded parasitoids and, in most citrus-growing regions, predators are not economically effective. Firstly, in this study, the general ecology of thrips was reviewed along with the recorded history of S. aurantii and its control. Host plant relationships of S. aurantii were then examined and wild hosts were {{not found to be}} important in promoting <b>citrus</b> <b>thrips</b> outbreaks in the orchard after flowering. In addition, Scirtothrips dorsalis Hood, which attacks citrus in Asia, was collected {{for the first time in}} Africa, but from Castor Oil plant. It is therefore a potential pest of citrus here. Notes on its appearance compared to that of S. aurantii were prepared. Weekly sampling of S. aurantii adults was carried out from June 1984 to May 1990. Population fluctuations were then correlated with phenology of the citrus trees and the direct and indirect effects of weather. Temperature and rainfall were not found to be significantly directly correlated with thrips numbers recorded. However, the indirect effects of rainfall were important in promoting a large winter thrips population in certain years. Relatively high rainfall during March and April compared to that of the previous January and February stimulated atypical flushing of the citrus trees during autumn and the setting of out-of-season fruit. S. aurantii then exploited this unusual food source and high numbers were subsequently recorded in the following winter; as well as in spring. Thus the mild winter climate alone could not suppress thrips numbers at Letaba. Dispersal/Emergence traps, which are used in the U. S. A. for the monitoring of Scirtothrips citri, were evaluated over 24 months, and were effective in recording population peaks of S. aurantii. The emergence rate of adults in relation to second instar larvae trapped was 43. 7 %. 35. 7 % of adults caught after emerging from the soil were males and 64. 3 were females. In contrast, yellow traps had recorded 59. 1 % males and 40. 9 % females over the same period. The yellow traps were subsequently found to be biased towards male catches when young fruit and/or soft flush was present on the citrus trees. Relative inhibition of female flight activity during times of food abundance is known in other thrips species. During times of food scarcity, the bias in the yellow trap results disappeared. At Letaba Estates, availability of food rather than the direct effects of weather was seen to be the most important factor in governing S. aurantii numbers. Because of the importance of soft flush in the promotion of S. aurantii population increase, it is recommended that more attention should be given to the control of thrips on, as well as conducting surveys for, this food source. As the climate at Letaba is so favourable for <b>citrus</b> <b>thrips,</b> even during winter, it is further recommended that trapping for S. aurantii is carried out throughout the year. Furthermore, males and females should be recorded separately in trapping results as the sex ratio gives an indication of the phenological state of the tree. ...|$|E

OHB evaluated factors that contributed to pesticide exposure and identified safer alternatives by conducting literature reviews on katydid and thrips control, drift prevention technology, and other relevant topics, and by interviewing inte-grated pest management advisors, conventional and organic growers, equip-ment manufacturers, county agricultural commissioners, pest control advisors, regulatory agencies, and others. We prioritized methods using the industrial hygiene hierarchy of controls. We identified safer pest control practices that incorporated hazard elimination, chemical substitution, engineering controls, and administrative controls, including employer policies and governmen...|$|E
40|$|The {{residual}} activity of insecticides to second instar <b>citrus</b> <b>thrips</b> was measured on lemon foliage in 1998. In April, Dimethoate and Agri-Mek provided only knockdown control of thrips, dropping to < 70 % mortality by 3 days after treatment (DAT). Baythroid performed slightly better, providing 95 % mortality 3 DAT, but by 7 DAT was giving about 74 % mortality. Alert, Carzol, Success and AZEXP- 2 provided the longest {{residual activity}}, lasting 7 days, but began to slip at 14 DAT. AZEXP- 1 induced only 74 % 0 DAT. Although, residual activity in general was greater in June than April, however {{this increase in}} residual activity did not necessarily increase the length of commercially acceptable residual. Agri-Mek and Dimethoate still only provided knockdown activity, and Baythroid was still giving 3 days of good activity. AZEXP- 1 performed much better following the June application relative to the April application, providing 3 days of adequate activity. Although we are not certain {{the reason for this}} result, it maybe due to the adsorption properties of this chemical relative to leaf physiology. Alert performed similarly in June and April, and Carzol, Success and AZEXP- 2 each lasted about 1 week longer...|$|E
40|$|South African <b>citrus</b> <b>thrips</b> (Scirtothrips aurantii) {{established}} adventitiously in Australia. Although it {{is a major}} horticultural pest in Africa, it is now advocated as {{a possible}} biological control agent against Bryophyllum delagoense Eckl. & Zeyh. (Crassulaceae). To evaluate the biocontrol potential of S. aurantii a two year field study was conducted on the western Darling Downs of southern Queensland. Imidacloprid insecticide was applied to two quadrats at each of 18 field sites to assess, in the absence of S. aurantii, the persistence of individual plants and to quantify propagule production and recruitment by this declared weed. A third quadrat was left, as a control, to be infested naturally by S. aurantii. When released from herbivory by thrips in the field, plants grew significantly more, flowered more, and were significantly more fecund than plants in the quadrats with S. aurantii. Increases in growth and fecundity translated into significantly increased plant numbers but not increased recruitment. Recruitment even declined in experimental quadrats, through the indirect effects of releasing plants from herbivory. Field sampling also revealed that S. aurantii may be sensitive to seasonal climatic fluctuations. These and other local climatic influences may limit the biological control potential of the insect...|$|E
40|$|Amongst the 100 {{described}} species worldwide of {{the genus}} Scirtothrips, the South African <b>Citrus</b> <b>Thrips,</b> S. aurantii Faure, has been considered unique because the males possess a comb of stout setae on the hind femora (Hoddle & Mound, 2003). A new species that shares this character state is described here from Cedrus (Pinaceae) in Kenya, although no information is available for either species concerning the functional significance of this comb. The host association of this new species is interesting, because Scirtothrips species are {{generally considered to be}} associated with the young leaves of dicot plants, on which some are important pests (Mound & Palmer, 1981). Despite this, several relatively unrelated species within the genus have radiated onto various unrelated Gymnospermae. Two are associated with Juniperus (S. brevipennis in eastern North America, and S. juniperinus in Central Asia), one with Libocedrus (S. solaris in California), and one with Taxodium (S. taxodii in eastern North America), and in Australia two species are associated with the young fronds of cycads (S. litotetes on Lepidozamia and S. tenor on Cycas). Moreover, two species are known from different tree ferns (S. pteridis in Costa Rica, and S. frondis in Australia). Scirtothrips is thus yet another example of radiation within a genus of Thysanoptera that involves exploitation of unrelated plants (Mound, 2005), such as Cranothrips Bagnall (Pereyra & Mound, 2009) and Echinothrips Moulton (Mound & Marullo, 1996), rather than fidelity to any particular plant lineage. For full nomenclatural details of all taxa mentioned here see Mound (2010) ...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} was initiated in 2000 {{to study the}} feasibility of growing organic lemon in the southwest desert of Arizona. An eight-acre field was selected on Superstition sandy soil at the Mesa Agricultural Research Center to conduct this investigation. Lemon trees were planted at 25 feet spacing in 1998. The initial soil test in top 6 inches was 5 ppm nitrate-nitrogen and 4. 9 ppm NaHCO 3 -P. Soil pH was 8. 7 in the top 6 inches. Four treatments were applied in randomized complete block design repeated four times. The treatments were beef cattle feedlot manure and perfecta, clover and guano, guano and perfecta, and standard practice treatment. Soil samples were collected from 0 - 6 and 6 - 12 inches {{the first week of}} March 2001 and analyzed for NO₃-N NH₄-N, total nitrogen, organic matter and available P. Preliminary results showed no difference in NO₃-N, NH₄-N in 0 to 6 and 6 to 12 inches between treatments. Total nitrogen increased significantly from 0. 0262 % in standard treatment to 0. 0375 % in the manure treatment. Similarly, soil organic matter increased from 0. 297 % in standard treatment to 0. 4337 % in the manure perfecta treatment. Phosphorus level increased significantly from 6. 962 ppm in guano perfecta to 11. 187 PPM in manure perfecta treatment. Leaf tissue analysis indicated that nitrate level was influenced by treatment. Yields of Guano treatments were significantly greater than yields of the other treatments. Both commercial standard and organic treatments were equally effective in controlling <b>citrus</b> <b>thrips,</b> but repeated applications were required. Mite population has been detected at low level with no significant differences observed among treatments...|$|E
40|$|Three small plot {{efficacy}} {{trials were}} conducted evaluating different insecticide rotation regimes using commercially available insecticides {{and the effectiveness}} of new insecticide chemistries to control <b>citrus</b> <b>thrips.</b> Because of its long residual activity, and ability to control post- application egg hatches, Carzol appears to be the product that best fits the petal fall application window. Agri-Mek, Baythroid, Dimethoate or Vydate are probably good follow -up insecticides. However, Agri-Mek and Baythroid will probably provide greater control, especially under hotter conditions. If temperatures are cool, Agri-Mek looks good at reduced rates. The best insecticide for subsequent applications depends on temperatures and what was previously applied. Avoid making back -to -back applications of the same materials, and Dimethoate or Vydate applications should probably be followed by Carzol to catch post- application egg hatches. Overall, Vydate appears to be very similar to Dimethoate in efficacy and residual activity, while Baythroid appears to be slightly better. Although the addition of Lannate to Dimethoate does slightly enhance thrips control, the additional cost probably does not justify the tank mix. Of the new chemistries (Alert, Success, Ni- 25, and M- 96 - 015) evaluated, Success and M- 96 - 015 appeared to offer the best fruit protection. However, M- 96 - 015 {{does not appear to be}} very effective in killing the thrips, but is very effective in repelling them. Also, M- 96 - 015 will need to be applied at a high gallonage, i. e. 500 gal/A. None of the new products tested appear to fit the petal fall application window very well. Ni- 25, Alert and Success appear to lack the residual activity of Carzol, and M- 96 - 015 should not be used as a clean-up material but preventively following Carzol at petal fall...|$|E
