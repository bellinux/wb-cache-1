The Deep <b>Customer</b> <b>Insight</b> Innovation Framework synthesises the work of Beckman and Barry (2007) as a theoretical foundation, with the framework explored within a case study of Australian Airport Corporation seeking to drive airport innovations in operations and retail performance. The integration of a deep <b>customer</b> <b>insight</b> approach develops customer-centric and highly integrated solutions as a function of concentrated problem exploration and design-led idea generation. Businesses’ facing complex innovation challenges or seeking to making sense of future opportunities will be able to integrate design into existing innovation processes, anchoring the new approach between existing market research and business development activities. This paper contributes a framework and novel understanding as to how design methods are integrated into existing innovation processes for operationalization within industry...|$|R

50|$|Creating and {{delivering}} value proposition {{is a significant}} issue that marketing planners need to consider in planning strategies. Value propositions vary across industries and across different market segments within an industry. Capon and Hulbert linked the success of firms in the marketplace to the value provided to customers. They introduced a principle of customer value, with <b>customer</b> <b>insights</b> driving the company’s marketing activities. Customer value should also drive investment and production decisions, because customers perceive value {{on the benefits of}} the product or service they receive. Consequently, as the environment changes, and the customer experience and their desires change, the value they seek changes. As a result, companies are pressured to invest more resources in marketing research in order to gain deep <b>customer</b> <b>insights,</b> improve value proposition.|$|E

40|$|The {{generation}} {{and use of}} <b>customer</b> <b>insight</b> in marketing decisions is poorly understood, partly due to difficulties in obtaining research access and partly because market-based learning theory views knowledge as a fixed asset.

A multiple case study approach is used to explore managerial practices for insight {{generation and}} use. Multiple informants from each of four organisations in diverse sectors were interviewed. Findings reveal the importance of value alignment and value monitoring across the insight demand chain, to complement the information processing emphasis of extant research. Within the firm, the study suggests the importance of <b>customer</b> <b>insight</b> conduct practices including insight format, the role of automation and insight shepherding, to complement the much-researched process perspective.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to create an {{understanding}} of how customer engagement, communication / interaction and <b>customer</b> <b>insight</b> are driving forces behind the use of Social CRM from a leadership perspective. Method: The purpose of the study, we believed it was appropriate to use a qualitative approach to conduct the study. The empirical data were collected through semi-structured interviews. The sample consisted of 10 companies located in the Gävle area who are active on social media. The interviews were coded to obtain keywords and patterns. These patterns and keywords are then analyzed to arrive at the study's results. Results and contributions: Our results suggest that all the identified benefits, <b>customer</b> engagement, <b>customer</b> <b>insight</b> and communication are driving forces to make use of social CRM. However, they are used to different extents with different purposes. The two main drivers are customer engagement and communication. <b>Customer</b> <b>insight</b> is the driving force that is used least extensively and least consciously. Our investigation has confirmed much of the already existing research in this area but also highlighted that all driving forces do not have the same priority. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the driving forces behind the use of social CRM...|$|R

40|$|<b>Customer</b> <b>insight</b> is {{fundamental}} for market oriented organizations {{to understand their}} markets. However, the use of <b>customer</b> <b>insight</b> in marketing decisions is poorly understood, {{partly due to the}} difficulties in obtaining research access within organizations. But in part because under the perspective of market-based learning (MBL) theory, knowledge is a fixed asset so while there has been interest in insight acquisition, there has been less interest in the processes of insight use. This doctoral research focuses on managers’ use of <b>customer</b> <b>insight</b> within the organisation. It applies the case research method within two organisations using multiple sources of data, including interviews with multiple individuals and real-time experience tracking over a period of time. A framework of the process of insight use is developed from a review of literature and then explored and expanded upon through case study analysis. The emergent framework provides a more granular understanding of the multiple stages of the <b>customer</b> <b>insight</b> use cycle within an organization. It identifies that the insight use process is a perpetual feedback loop learning mechanism and involves several stages identified as: acquiring, filtering, transforming, sharing, analysing/interpreting, actioning and storing. The study finds that some phases are more likely to involve an individual manager while others are more likely to involve managers working collectively. For instance, the stages of acquisition and transforming tend to be individual while the stages relating to interpretation and actioning of insight tend to be collective. Managers may also opt to store insight as their next step for potential actioning at a later stage after any of the process stages. In addition to identifying the stages of insight use, this study identifies the pivotal role of organizational memory in the insight use process. Enablers and blockers of insight use are identified including that managers may respond to perceived information overload by (consciously or unconsciously) blocking information. A key contribution of this thesis is that it incorporates the first use in an organizational behaviour context, of the real-time experience tracking (RET) method. This pioneering use of RET demonstrates that this method may address some of the limitations that plague traditional participant observation techniques in organizational settings, such as active or moderate participation. It demonstrates that RET can be used to track the insight use process of individuals in organizations over time, helping to understand their individual and collective insight use processes. This multi-informant, multi-method study of <b>customer</b> <b>insight</b> use thus provides {{a deeper understanding of the}} processes of <b>customer</b> <b>insight</b> use than most previous MBL studies, which have typically employed single-informant, cross-sectional survey approaches. Practitioner implications include that new individual competencies in information use may be needed and that organisations may need to foster a new code of etiquette for information sharing and feedback between peers in organizations operating in today’s information rich environment...|$|R
40|$|In theory, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) {{technology}} and processes should help firms {{to identify the}} ‘right’ customers, understand their needs, predict their behaviour and develop tailored propositions. Yet numerous {{studies have found that}} CRM projects have failed to deliver the expected benefits. Academics and practitioners have begun to refer to a key resource required to fulfil the promise of CRM as ‘customer insight’. Project one explores how companies use <b>customer</b> <b>insight</b> to drive <b>customer</b> acquisition, retention and development and proposes a theoretical framework for actioning <b>customer</b> <b>insight.</b> Five case studies with UK-based large companies were undertaken, involving 25 in-depth interviews. Companies were found to be synthesising data from five areas: competitors, customers, markets, employees and channel partners. From this data they are generating four types of customer insight: market predictions, customer segments, propensity models and <b>customer</b> analytics. This <b>insight</b> is guiding strategy, operations, marketing, sales, product portfolio management and customer service. Project two explores a particularly promising area of practice uncovered in project one, namely how <b>customer</b> <b>insight</b> is used in inbound service call centres to drive crossselling, up-selling and retention. Empirical research into this practice of sales through service is sparse. A cross-sector multiple-case exploratory study of six UK-based organisations was undertaken, using interviews and agent observation. <b>Customer</b> <b>insight</b> in the form of predictive models delivered to agents’ screens appears to improve the effectiveness of sales through service. Contrary to common practitioner concerns, insight-based sales offers can {{have a positive impact on}} satisfaction, and introducing sales through service does not necessarily increase average handling time. Agents are more likely to make successful offers if they believe that they are ‘doing the right thing’ for the customer. A balanced set of targets covering productivity, satisfaction and sales seems important for agents combining sales and service roles. Further research is needed to validate and refine the seven propositions generated. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

5000|$|The author emphasises four {{components}} of this definition: First, such insight is “non-obvious”, {{so it does}} not normally come from just one source of information and often {{does not come from}} just analysis or just research; rather {{there is a need to}} converge evidence to glean insights. Second, true insights need to be “action-able”; hypotheses which stay theoretical and cannot be tested in practice are not insights. Third, <b>customer</b> <b>insights</b> should be powerful enough that when they are acted upon customers can be persuaded to [...] "change their behaviour". Just benefitting from targeting based on analysing past behaviour and assuming people will be creatures of habit does not reveal any depth of understanding them, certainly not insight. Fourth, to be sustainable, the goal of such customer change must be for [...] "mutual benefit". As [...] argues, a key law for marketing today is “earn and keep the trust of your customers”, which is achieved by acting in their best interests as well as the long term value for the organisation.|$|E
