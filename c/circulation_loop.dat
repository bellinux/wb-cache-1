40|$|In natural <b>circulation</b> <b>loops,</b> {{the driving}} force is usually low as {{it depends on the}} riser height which is {{generally}} of the order of a few meters. The heat transport capability of natural <b>circulation</b> <b>loops</b> (NCLs) is directly proportional to the flow rate it can generate.

Further, the loop diameter also plays an important role on the stability behavior.

50|$|A new {{software}} upload in September 2008 necessitated a brief shutdown of the NICMOS cooling system. Several attempts {{to restart the}} cooling system were unsuccessful due to issues with the cryogenic circulator. After waiting more than six weeks for parts of the instrument to warm up, and theorized ice particles to sublimate from the neon circulating loop, the cooler once again failed to restart. An Anomaly Review Board (ARB) was then convened by NASA. The ARB concluded that ice or other solid particle migrated from the dewar to the circulator during the September 2008 restart attempt and that the circulator may be damaged, and determined an alternative set of startup parameters. A successful restart at 13:30 EST on 16 December 2008 led to four days of cooler operations followed by another shutdown. On 1 August 2009, the cooler was restarted again; NICMOS was expected to resume operations in mid-February 2010 and operated through October 22, 2009, at which point a lock-up of Hubble’s data handling system caused the telescope to shut down. The circulation flow rate to NICMOS was greatly reduced during this operating period confirming blockage in the <b>circulation</b> <b>loop.</b> Continued operation at reduced flow rates would limit NICMOS science so plans for purging and refilling the circulation system with clean neon gas were developed by NASA. The <b>circulation</b> <b>loop</b> is equipped with an extra neon tank and remotely operated solenoid valves for on-orbit purge-fill operations. As of 2013, these purge-fill operations {{have not yet been}} performed.|$|E
50|$|Presence {{of water}} in {{hydrogen}} has to be avoided, as it causes deterioration to hydrogen cooling properties, corrosion of the generator parts, arcing in the high voltage windings, and reduces the lifetime of the generator. A desiccant-based dryer is usually included in the gas <b>circulation</b> <b>loop,</b> typically with a moisture probe in the dryer's outlet, sometimes also in its inlet. Presence of moisture is also an indirect evidence for air leaking into the generator compartment. Another option is optimizing the hydrogen scavenging, so the dew point is kept within the generator manufacturer specifications. The water is usually introduced into the generator atmosphere as an impurity in the turbine oil; another route is via leaks in water cooling systems.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a methodology {{for the analysis}} of the flow stability in natural <b>circulation</b> <b>loops</b> containing fluids at supercritical pressure.

The RELAP 5 code is firstly used for predicting the observed phenomena, obtaining a qualitative prediction of instabilities with quantitative discrepancies in relation to the conditions observed for the onset of unstable behaviour. In the aim to allow for a systematic discussion of stability phenomena, dimensionless parameters previously proposed to analyse the stability of single heated channels with fluids at supercritical pressures are now adapted and applied to natural <b>circulation</b> <b>loops.</b> The proposed dimensionless numbers address purely thermal-hydraulic phenomena, disregarding the presence of heating structures.

50|$|The {{atmospheric}} circulation pattern that George Hadley described {{was an attempt}} to explain the trade winds. The Hadley cell is a closed <b>circulation</b> <b>loop</b> which begins at the equator. There, moist air is warmed by the Earth's surface, decreases in density and rises. A similar air mass rising {{on the other side of}} the equator forces those rising air masses to move poleward. The rising air creates a low pressure zone near the equator. As the air moves poleward, it cools, becomes more dense, and descends at about the 30th parallel, creating a high-pressure area. The descended air then travels toward the equator along the surface, replacing the air that rose from the equatorial zone, closing the loop of the Hadley cell. The poleward movement of the air in the upper part of the troposphere deviates toward the east, caused by the coriolis acceleration (a manifestation of conservation of angular momentum). At the ground level however, the movement of the air toward the equator in the lower troposphere deviates toward the west, producing a wind from the east. The winds that flow to the west (from the east, easterly wind) at the ground level in the Hadley cell are called the Trade Winds.|$|E

5000|$|While the {{majority}} of these pumps mount nearest to the hot water heater and have no adjustable temperature capabilities, a significant reduction in energy can be achieved by using a temperature adjustable thermostatically controlled circulation pump mounted at the last fixture on the loop. Thermostatically controlled circulation pumps allow owners to choose the desired temperature of hot water to be maintained within the hot water pipes since most homes do not require [...] degree water instantly out of their taps. Thermostatically controlled circulation pumps cycle on and off to maintain a user's chosen temperature and consume less energy than a continuously operating pump. By installing a thermostatically controlled pump just after the farthest fixture on the loop, cyclic pumping maintains ready hot water up to the last fixture on the loop instead of wasting energy heating the piping from the last fixture to the water heater. Often installing a circulation pump at the farthest fixture on hot water <b>circulation</b> <b>loop</b> due to limited available space, cosmetics, noise restrictions or lack of available power. Recent advancements in hot water circulation technology allow for benefiting from temperature controlled pumping without having to install the pump at the last fixture on the hot water loop. These advanced hot water circulation systems utilize a water contacting temperature probe strategically installed at the last fixture on the loop to minimize the energy wasted heating lengthy return pipes. Thermal insulation applied to the pipes helps mitigate this second loss and minimize the amount of water that must be pumped to keep hot water constantly available.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of the piping material thermal and geometrical properties on the dynamic stability of single-phase natural circulation loops. To this purpose, a semi-analytical approach is developed by adopting the tools provided by the linear analysis. By considering a generic natural <b>circulation</b> <b>loop</b> configuration with a localized heat flux and a homogenously distributed Internal Heat Generation (IHG), the governing equations (mass, momentum and energy balance) are linearized around a steady-state solution of the system and treated by means of the Fourier transform to obtain dimensionless stability maps. Moreover, in order to verify the linear analysis methodology, a numerical strategy is adopted to solve the nonlinear governing equations and to investigate the natural circulation dynamics in the time domain. In principle, both the developed approaches can be applied to any natural <b>circulation</b> <b>loop</b> configuration. In the present work, the linear and the nonlinear analyses are applied to a specific natural <b>circulation</b> <b>loop</b> geometry, namely the Horizontal Heater Horizontal Cooler (HHHC) one.

40|$|Brief {{review of}} the design, {{specific}} features of thermal hydraulics of reactor cores and <b>circulation</b> <b>loops</b> of pool-type research reactors is given. Principal distinguishing features of research reactors as compared with industrial power reactor units are outlined. Design of reactor units is examined using the example of two research reactors VVR-M (Gatchina) and VVR-ts (Obninsk). Direction of coolant circulation constitutes the feature of research reactor installations which is of key importance. In contrast to power reactor units, propagation of coolant in research reactors is arranged in downwards direction, i. e. from core top to bottom.
