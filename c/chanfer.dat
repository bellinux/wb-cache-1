40|$|The {{scope of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the marginal fitness of coping made with the electroforming Gramm system. Two identical stainless steel master casts were milled simulating the tooth reduction for metal ceramic crowns; one with long <b>chanfer</b> and another with round shoulder preparations. The impression material used was a polivinilsyloxane silicone with the double impression technique, thus obtaining ten specimens of each máster cast. To establish a pattern for impression a sheet of accetate with 1, 4 mm thick was used. A dental surveyor was prepared to maintain constant the insertion and the removal axis of the master casts during all the impressions. The dies were made with gypsum type IV and after the casts were dyed with spacer, these were duplicated with laboratory silicone to obtain a second master cast with special gypsum. The casts were prepare with copper wire and coated with silver to promove the galvanic current so that a gold eletroforming is achieved. Upon adjustment and cleansing, the copings were adjusted to the master casts, which were fixed in an octagonal stainless steel table, and observed at a measuring microscope Olympus equipped with digital desk. The data obtained was submitted to “t” test and Mann-Whitney statistical test with significance level of 5 %. The mean values of long <b>chanfer</b> and round shoulder were 29, 77 mm and 26, 77 mm, respectively, (p= 0, 657 and p= 1, 00). With the results obtained, it may be concluded that there was not a statistically significant difference, so both marginal preparations may be used...|$|E
40|$|Considerando as dificuldades técnicas existentes na confecção de restaurações fundidas, onde o mínimo desajuste {{cervical}} acarreta sérios problemas clínicos futuros, este trabalho visa a analisar o ajuste cervical de coroas totais metálicas, confeccionadas com liga à base de prata/paládio (PALLlAG - M) e paládio/prata (PORS - ON 4), com três diferentes tipos de término cervical : ombro reto, ombro biselado em 20 ° e chanfro em 45 °, sobre troquéis torneados de aço inoxidável. Para fusão das ligas foram utilizadas três fontes de calor: acetilen%xigênio, gás/oxigênio e resistência elétrica. Após a fundição, os corposde-prova foram assentados sobre seus respectivos troquéis, sob carga estática de 9 kg. As leituras da interface troquei/coroa foram feitas em um microscópio comparador, provido de um micrômetro digital. Os resultados indicaram que a liga de Pd/Ag (PORS - ON 4) apresentou a maior média de desajuste cervical, sendo diferente estatisticamente (5 %) da liga de Ag/Pd (PALLlAG - M); o método acetilen%xigênio resultou na maior média de desajuste, sendo diferente estatisticamente (5 %) das fontes resistência elétrica e gás/oxigênio, ambas iguais; os ombro biselado em 20 ° e chanfro mostráram as maiores médias de desajuste, sendo ambos iguais estatisticamente (5 %), e diferentes do ombro reto. Nessas condições estatísticas, concluiu-se que a liga de Ag/Pd (PALLlAG - M) apresentou o melhor ajuste cervical, dentro da análise das ligas utilizadas; as fontes de calor de fundição resistência elétrica e gás/oxigênio mostraram o melhor ajuste cervical, não diferindo estatisticamente (5 %) entre si; e, o ombro reto obteve o melhor ajuste cervical dentro da análise dos tipos de término cervicalRegarding the existenting {{difficulties in}} making casting restorations, where the minimal cervlcal discrepancy {{lead to a}} future serious clinical problems, this research will analyse the fit of total metal crowns, making with Ag/Pd and Pd/Ag alloys, with three different marginal configurations : shoulder, 20 -degree bevel shoulder and 45 -degree chanfered, on the stainless steel dies. To cast the alloys, three heat sources have been used : acetylene-oxygen, gas-oxygen and eletric resistance. After the casting, the specimens were seated on the dies, with a static load of 9 kg. The reading of the die/crown interface was made on a comparated microscope, using a digital micrometer. The {{results indicated that the}} Pd/Ag (PORS ON 4) alloy showed the highest cervical discrepancy average, has been statistical different (5 %) of the Ag/Pd (PALLlAG - M) alloy; the method acetylene/oxygen resulted on a highest cervical discrepancy average, has been statistical different (5 %) from the eletric resistance and gas/oxygen sources, both equal; the 20 -degree bevel shoulder and 45 -degree <b>chanfer</b> showed the highest discrepancy average, both equal statistically (5 %), and different o(shoulder. In this statistical condition~, it was concluded that the Ag/Pd (PALLlAG - M) alloy showed the better cervicall fit, inside the analysis of the utilized alloys; the heat sources of casting eletric resistance and gas/oxygen, showed the better cervical fit, without statistical differences (5 %) between themselves; and, the shoulder obtained the better cervlcal fit inside the nalysis of the marginal configurations...|$|E
50|$|The Howard Motor Company {{built the}} {{showroom}} in 1927; {{it was one}} of several car dealerships built along Colorado Boulevard. The building has a Spanish Colonial Revival design with Churrigueresque ornamentation; its design includes a decorative frieze, <b>chanfered</b> corners, and an elliptical arched entrance topped by the dominant Churrigueresque element. The Bush-Morgan Motor Company moved into the building in 1938 and occupied it through the 1950s. The building was still used as an auto showroom in the 1990s.|$|R
