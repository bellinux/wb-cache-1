We aimed to determine incidence and {{risk factors for}} HPV acquisition in girls who report no previous sex in Tanzania, a country with high HPV prevalence and cervical cancer incidence. MethodsWe followed 503 adolescent girls aged 15 – 16  years in Mwanza, Tanzania, with face-to-face interviews and self-administered vaginal swabs every 3  months for 18  months; 397 girls reported no sex before enrollment or during follow-up; of whom, 120 were randomly selected. Samples from enrollment, 6 -, 12 -, and 18 -month visits were tested for 37 HPV genotypes. Incidence, <b>clearance,</b> <b>point</b> prevalence, and duration of any HPV and genotype-specific infections were calculated and associated factors were evaluated. ResultsOf 120 girls who reported no previous sex, 119 were included, contributing 438 samples. HPV was detected in 51 (11. 6 %) samples. The overall incidence of new HPV infections was 29. 4 / 100 person-years (95 % confidence interval: 15. 9 – 54. 2). The point prevalence of vaccine types HPV- 6,- 11,- 16, and - 18 was. 9 %,. 9 %, 2. 0 %, and 0 %, respectively.

The control objective is to articulate the shroud in the high pressure turbine section {{in order to maintain}} a certain <b>clearance</b> set <b>point</b> given several possible engine transient events. The system must also exhibit reasonable robustness to modeling uncertainties and reasonable noise rejection properties. Two actuators were chosen to fulfill such a requirement, both of which possess different levels of technological readiness: electrohydraulic servovalves and piezoelectric stacks. Identification of design constraints, desired actuator parameters, and actuator limitations are addressed in depth; all of which are intimately tied with the hardware and controller design process. Analytical demonstrations of the performance and robustness characteristics of the two axisymmetric LQG clearance control systems are presented. Takeoff simulation results show that both actuators are capable of maintaining the clearance within acceptable bounds and demonstrate robustness to parameter uncertainty. The present model-based control strategy was employed to demonstrate the tradeoff between performance, control effort, and robustness and to implement optimal state estimation in a noisy engine environment with intent to eliminate ad hoc methods for designing reliable control systems...|$|R

40|$|Wear {{and failure}} of {{mechanical}} seals may be critical in certain application {{and should be}} avoided. Large relative misalignment between the seal faces {{is the most likely}} cause for intermittent contact and the increased friction that eventually brings failure. Adjustment of seal clearance is probably the most readily implemented method of reducing the relative misalignment and the elimination of seal face contact during its operation. This method is demonstrated {{with the aid of a}} noncontacting flexibly mounted rotor (FMR) mechanical face seal test rig employing a cascade control scheme. Eddy current proximity probes measure the seal clearance directly. The inner loop controls the clearance, maintaining a desired gap through adjusting the air pressure in the rotor chamber of the seal. When contact is detected the outer loop adjusts the <b>clearance</b> set <b>point</b> according to variance differences in the probes signals. These differences in variance have been found to be a reliable quantitative indication for such contacts. They are complimentary to other more qualitative phenomenological indications, and provide the controlled variable data for the outer loop. Experiments are conducted to test and verify this active control scheme and strategy. Analysis and results both show that contrary to intuition for the seal under investigation reducing seal clearance can eliminate contact and the outer cascade loop indeed drives the control toward this solution. 1...|$|R
40|$|Formula 1 {{racing is}} one of the most {{advanced}} technological sports. The aerodynamic on open wheel race cars is essential for the performance during a race. The front wing on a race car produces about 30 percent of the entire downforce of a race car. Several studies on front wings for open wheel race cars are conducted by various authors. A number of research studies include single element airfoils in ground effect and undisturbed flow. Numerical and experimental studies show that by decreasing the ground clearance, the downforce increases. The most efficient ground clearance is reported to be approximately 10 percent of the chord length. Another effective parameter to increase the downforce is the increase of angle of attack. Both increase of angle of attack and decrease of ground clearance result in an increasing of drag. Experimental studies on race car front wings have been carried out in disturbed flow. As soon as a wing operates in a wake, a significant change on the aerodynamic forces can be found. This aerodynamic study of race car wings will focus on a wing operating in a wake. The wing model is analyzed prior in freestream and ground effect only. The study in ground effect shows a maximum downforce at a ground clearance of 22 percent of the chord length. The study in a wake consists of different ground clearance levels and different distances between a bluff body and the analyzed wing. At a distance of 10 percent of a car length, both downforce and drag experience a significant decrease compared to undisturbed flow. While moving the wing further downstream, the lift and drag coefficient recover towards the values of a wing operating in ground effect only. The most efficient ground <b>clearance</b> <b>point</b> moves from 22 percent to 25 percent of the chord length at a distance of 30, respectively 50 percent of a car length.

Here, we characterize the onset of learning and memory deficits in this model. We report that 2 -month-old, prepathologic mice are cognitively unimpaired. The earliest cognitive impairment manifests at 4 months as a deficit in long-term retention and correlates with the accumulation of intraneuronal Aβ in the hippocampus and amygdala. Plaque or tangle pathology is not apparent at this age, suggesting that they contribute to cognitive dysfunction at later time <b>points.</b> <b>Clearance</b> of the intraneuronal Aβ pathology by immunotherapy rescues the early cognitive deficits on a hippocampal-dependent task.

40|$|In {{the case}} of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, UTP at {{elevated}} concen-trations suppresses terminated transcript accumulation during multiple-round transcription from a DNA construct containing the T 7 A 1 promoter and Te terminator. The step that is affected by UTP at elevated concen-trations is promoter clearance. In an attempt to understand better the mechanism by which UTP regulates this step, we analyzed the effect of UTP on the formation of pppApU {{in the presence of}} only UTP and ATP. At elevated concentrations, UTP is a non-competitive inhibitor with respect to ATP in the formation of pppApU. This indicates that the effect of UTP on the formation of pppApU is mediated through an allosteric site. Moreover, the magnitude of the inhibition of pppApU formation is sufficient to account for the decrease in terminated transcript accumu-lation at elevated UTP concentrations. Thus, it appears that UTP modulates terminated transcript accumulation during multiple-round transcription from this DNA construct by allosteric regulation of promoter <b>clearance</b> at the <b>point</b> of transcription initiation...|$|R

In the last five decades, despite the use of aggressive antibiotics and advances in intensive care medicine, the mortality rate of sepsis remains high. In 2005, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 11 million children die annually due to sepsis, of these, 30, 000 children under five years of age die daily. Serum lactate concentration is useful to evaluate the progression of sepsis in children. Lactate clearance {{can be used to}} evaluate the outcomes in sepsis management in children. Objective To evaluate the relationship between lactate clearance and patient mortality. We also attempted to assess the usefulness of lactate clearance as an early prognostic marker in pediatric sepsis. Methods This prospective cohort study was conducted at the Pediatrics Department of Prof Kandou General Hospital from November 2013 to April 2014. Consecutive sampling was undertaken on 45 children aged 1 month to 15 years who were diagnosed with sepsis according to the inclusion criteria. First lactate serum was measured immediately following patient admission to the PICU. The next serum lactate measurement was six hours after initial treatment in the PICU. Results The mean lactate clearance was higher in the survivors’ than in the non-survivors’ group (58. 48 %vs. 18. 20 %, respectively). Logistic regression analysis revealed a lactate <b>clearance</b> cutoff <b>point</b> of 34. 7 %, with sensitivity 87. 50 %, specificity 96. 55 %, positive predictive value 93. 33 %, and negative predictive value 93. 33 %.

By supplementing surface data with a surface bounding-box hierarchy on the GPU, we answer distance queries such as finding the closest point on a curved NURBS surface given {{any point in}} space and evaluating the clearance between two solid models constructed using multiple NURBS surfaces. We simultaneously output the parameter values corresponding to the solution of these queries along with the model space values. Though our algorithms {{make use of the}} programmable fragment processor, the accuracy is based on the model space precision, unlike earlier graphics algorithms that were based only on image space precision.

Doubled reticulocyte counts in tg 6 suggest an increased erythrocyte turnover. Here {{we show that}} compared with wild-type (wt) animals, erythrocyte lifespan in tg 6 is 70 % lower in tg 6 mice. Transgenic mice have a younger erythrocyte population as indicated by higher intercellular water and potassium content, higher flexibility, decreased density, increased surface to volume ratio, and decreased osmotic fragility. Interestingly, despite being younger, the tg 6 erythrocyte population also harbors characteristics of accelerated aging such as an increased band 4. 1 a to 4. 1 b ratio, signs of oxidative stress, or decreased surface CD 47 and sialic acids. In tg 6, in vivo tracking of PKH 26 -labeled erythrocytes revealed dramatically increased erythrocyte incorporation by their liver macrophages. In vitro experiments showed that tg 6 macrophages are more active than wt macrophages and that tg 6 erythrocytes are more attractive for macrophages than wt ones. In conclusion, in tg 6 mice erythrocyte aging is accelerated, which results, together with an increased number and activity of their macrophages, in enhanced erythrocyte <b>clearance.</b> Our data <b>points</b> toward a new mechanism down-regulating red cell mass in excessive erythrocytosis in mice...|$|R
40|$|Connecting {{parallel}} rail tracks, scissors crossovers typically {{consist of}} four turnouts and a central diamond crossing, while flange-way gaps provide wheel flange <b>clearance</b> at the <b>points</b> of rail intersection. Guardrails, supported through base-plates, provide wheel guidance {{in the area}} of the gap. In the Athens Metro, within less than a year in operation, fracturing of a vast number of guardrail support base-plates was reported. This paper documents the methodology and results of a comprehensive investigation of the possible causes of these failures. This premature cracking was initially investigated through stress and acceleration measurements. Subsequently, a three-dimensional finite element model was developed to analyse the dynamic behaviour of the system with and without foundation deficiencies. It was unveiled that only the model with foundation deficiencies could reproduce the measured response. The role of foundation-structure interaction (FSI) proved doubly detrimental for the performance of the system: (i) the initial defective curved shape of the sleepers induced large bending pre-stress on the base-plates, and (ii) the defective gap-dominated foundation increased the flexibility of the system leading to further excessive sleeper bending, and thereby to increased distress of the base-plates. The combination of the two deficiencies was deemed responsible for the observed failure. The method of installation was shown to be of critical importance for the durability of the crossover. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|Joint <b>clearances</b> in antenna <b>pointing</b> {{mechanisms}} lead to {{uncertainty in}} function deviation. Current studies mainly focus on radial clearance of revolute joints, while axial clearance {{has rarely been}} taken into consideration. In fact, owning to errors from machining and assembly, thermal deformation and so forth, practically, axial clearance is inevitable in the joint. In this study, an error equivalent model (EEM) of revolute joints is proposed with considering both radial and axial clearances. Compared to the planar model of revolute joints only considering radial clearance, the journal motion inside the bearing is more abundant and matches the reality better in the EEM. The model is also extended for analyzing the error distribution of a spatial dual-axis (“X–Y” type) antenna pointing mechanism of Spot-beam antennas which especially demand a high pointing accuracy. Three case studies are performed which illustrates the internal relation between radial clearance and axial clearance. It is found that when the axial clearance is big enough, the physical journal can freely realize both translational motion and rotational motion. While if the axial clearance is limited, {{the motion of the}} physical journal will be restricted. Analysis results indicate that the consideration of both radial and axial clearances in the revolute joint describes the journal motion inside the bearing more precise. To further validate the proposed model, a model of the EEM is designed and fabricated. Some suggestions on the design of revolute joints are also provided.|$|R
40|$|Thin-walled {{cylindrical}} composite shell structures can {{be applied}} in space applications, looking for lighter and cheaper launcher transport system. These structures are prone to buckling under axial compression and may exhibit sensitivity to geometrical imperfections. Today the design of such structures is based on NASA guidelines from the 1960 ’s using a conservative lower bound curve generated from a database of experimental results. In this guideline the structural behavior of composite materials may not be appropriately considered since the imperfection sensitivity and the buckling load of shells made of such materials depend on the lay-up design. It is clear that with {{the evolution of the}} composite materials and fabrication processes this guideline must be updated and / or new design guidelines investigated. This need becomes even more relevant when cutouts are introduced to the structure, which are commonly necessary to account for access points and to provide <b>clearance</b> and attachment <b>points</b> for hydraulic and electric systems. Therefore, it is necessary to understand how a cutout with different dimensions affects the buckling load of a thin-walled cylindrical shell structure in combination with other initial geometric imperfections. In this context, this paper present some observations regarding the buckling load behavior vs. cutout size and radius over thickness ratio, of laminated composite curved panels and cylindrical shells, that could be applied in further recommendations, to allow identifying when the buckling of the structure is dominated by the presence of the cutout or by other initial imperfections...|$|R
