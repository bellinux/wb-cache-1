I confess that it has its fascinations for me; though at every new thought I find myself romancing {{in a way that makes}} me pull up suddenly and look facts resolutely in the face. I sometimes wonder whether the influence or emanation from the sick-room at times affects me as it did the others--the Detective, for instance. Of course it may be that if it is anything chemical, any drug, for example, in vaporeal form, its effects may be cumulative. But then, what could there be that could produce such an effect? The room is, I know, full of mummy smell; and no wonder, with so many relics from the tomb, let alone the actual mummy of that animal which Silvio attacked. By the way, I am going to test him tomorrow; I have been on the trace of a mummy cat, and am to get possession of it in the morning. When I bring it here we shall find out if it be a fact that racial instinct can survive a few thousand years in the grave. However, to get back to the subject in hand. These very mummy smells arise from the presence of substances, and <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>substances,</b> which the Egyptian priests, who were the learned men and scientists of their time, found by the experience of centuries to be strong enough to arrest the natural forces of decay. There must be powerful agencies at work to effect such a purpose; and it is possible that we may have here some rare substance or combination whose qualities and powers are not understood in this later and more prosaic age. I wonder if Mr. Trelawny has any knowledge, or even suspicion, of such a kind? I only know this for certain, that a worse atmosphere for a sick chamber could not possibly be imagined; and I admire the courage of Sir James Frere in refusing to have anything to do with a case under such conditions. These instructions of Mr. Trelawny to his daughter, and from what you have told me, the care with which he has protected his wishes through his solicitor, show that he suspected something, at any rate. Indeed, it would almost seem as if he expected something to happen.... I wonder if it would be possible to learn anything about that! Surely his papers would show or suggest something.... It is a difficult matter to tackle; but it might have to be done. His present condition cannot go on for ever; and if anything should happen there would have to be an inquest. In such case full examination would have to be made into everything.... As it stands, the police evidence would show a murderous attack more than once repeated. As no clue is apparent, it would be necessary to seek one in a motive." ...|$|E

40|$|Today's {{operations}} in peace keeping or peace enforcing missions {{are faced with}} the need to stop motorized vehicles without exposing civil and military task forces to an unnecessary great risk. Installing military "Checkpoints" is an essential and widespread method to prevent terroristic motivated crimes in crisis-torn areas with asymmetrical threat scenarios.

40|$|The {{intestinal}} mucosa {{is not simply}} a barrier allowing entry of compounds such as nutrients or chemicals, and restricting that of others. Intestinal cells and activities perform selective absorption, biotransformations and efflux back to the lumen. Furthermore, food substances affect both bioavailability and intestinal function. Some are able to act as transcriptional regulators and enzyme modulators. This review points out plausible interactions between food contaminants and/or natural constituents at molecular and cellular levels and focuses on the effects of classical (pesticides and veterinary drugs), environmental (heavy metals, PCBs, dioxins, etc.) and food processing generated (PAHs, heterocyclic amines, etc.) contaminants on absorption, metabolism and efflux. Special attention is given to secondary metabolites of molds (mycotoxins) and plants (polyphenols). Molecular targets are briefly described as well as regulation mechanisms. Where possible, data referred to deal with human intestinal functions in vivo, and with in vitro studies on human intestinal Caco- 2 cells; however, since data related to the intestine are rather scarce, effects on molecular targets in liver are also considered. This review also points out the urgent need for fully validated high throughput in vitro tools to screen <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>substances,</b> at realistic intestinal concentrations.

Superhydrophobic (SH) biomimetic surfaces based on the so-called lotus effect are produced, onto which arrays of micro-indentations allow the fixing of liquid droplets, based on the rose-petal effect. The developed platforms are able to sustain arrays of quasi-spherical microdroplets, allowing the isolation and confinement of different <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>substances</b> and living cells. Distinct compartmentalized physical, chemical, and biological processes may take place and be monitored in each droplet. The devices permit the addition/removal of liquid and mechanical stirring by adding magnetic microparticles into each droplet.

The main conclusion of the report {{is that there is}} no single drug problem requiring one solution -various problematic <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>substances,</b> patterns of use and influencing factors exist - but that there is a need to target and prevent use of the most dangerous substances.

Raising public awareness of the importance of deprivation as a predisposing factor for the most damaging forms of drug misuse is identified as another important strategy in order to win general acceptance of the need for the large resources that will be needed to deal with these problems. The report also identifies a need for broadly-based programmes focusing on experimental drug use by young people of all social classes. Information alone has very limited effect in preventing drug misuse among young people and there is a need for continued investment in approaches that emphasise personal and social development.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} {{of alcohol and}} other psychoactive substances is high in biological specimens from injured drivers, while the {{prevalence of}} these psychoactive substances in samples from drivers in normal traffic is low. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the prevalence of alcohol and psychoactive substances in drivers admitted to hospital for treatment of injuries after road traffic accidents with that in drivers in normal traffic, and calculate risk estimates for the substances, and <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>substances</b> found in both groups. Methods Injured drivers were recruited in the hospital emergency department and drivers in normal conditions were taken from the hospital catchment area in roadside tests of moving traffic. Substances found in blood samples from injured drivers and oral fluid samples from drivers in moving traffic were compared using equivalent cut off concentrations, and risk estimates were calculated using logistic regression analyses. Results In 21. 9 % of the injured drivers, substances were found: most commonly alcohol (11. 5 %) and stimulants eg. cocaine or amphetamines (9. 4 %). This compares to 3. 2 % of drivers in normal traffic where the most commonly found substances were z-hypnotics (0. 9 %) and benzodiazepines (0. 8 %). The greatest increase in risk of being injured was for alcohol combined with any other substance (OR: 231. 9, 95 % CI: 33. 3 - 1615. 4, p[*] Conclusion The prevalence of psychoactive substances was higher among injured drivers than drivers in normal moving traffic. The risk of accident is greatly increased among drivers who tested positive for alcohol, in particular, those who had also ingested one or more psychoactive substances. Various preventive measures should be considered to curb the prevalence of driving under the influence of psychoactive substances as these drivers constitute a significant risk for other road users as well as themselves. </p...|$|E

However, we claim that our interdisciplinary setting (a physics class that builds deep connections to biology and chemistry) leads to a different set of considerations and conclusions.

40|$|In der kombinatorischen Substanztestung steigen, mit gebräuchlichen Mikro-titerplatten-Methoden, die benötigten Pipettierschritte mit der Anzahl der verwendeten Konzentrationen und Substanzen exponentiell an. Die Verminderung von Pipettierschritten in kombinatorisch angelegten Experimenten bedeutet daher eine wichtige methodische Weiterentwicklung. In der klinischen Anwendung von Chemotherapeutika sind empirische Daten immer noch Grundlage für die Behandlungspläne von Krebspatienten. Dabei werden Subpopulationen von Patienten, die weniger oder gar nicht auf eine bestimmte Substanzkombination reagieren, nicht ausreichend berücksichtigt. Der Ansatz der Testmethode, welche in dieser Dissertation vorgestellt wird, mit der individuelles Ansprechen von Patienten auf Wirkstoffe vorhergesagt werden kann, soll helfen die Behandlung von Krebspatienten in der Zukunft zu verbessern. Um die {{genannten}} Verbesserungen zu erreichen, wird das Phänomen der Diffusion ausgenutzt, welche in dem dafür neu entwickelten sogenannten "Diffusion Device" Anwendung findet. Durch die orthogonale Anordnung zweier Diffusionsrichtungen wird hierbei die Möglichkeit geschaffen, stufenlos unendlich viele Mischungs-verhältnisse zu erreichen. Im Rahmen dieser Dissertation wurde die Funktionsweise und Anwendung des Diffusion Device optimiert und mit einem zellbasierten Bioassay verbunden. Dazu wurde der Diffusion Device zuerst auf alle für die Diffusion wichtigen Parameter untersucht und validiert. Danach wurden chemotherapeutische Substanzen im Diffusion Device auf Zelllinien und primäre Zellisolate getestet. Bei den dabei implementierten Bioassays handelt es sich um einen annexinbasierten Apoptosenachweis und einen MTT-Zytoxizitätstest. Prioritäten der Arbeit lagen auf der einfachen Handhabung und dem geringen Gebrauch von Resourcen und technischem Equipment. Ebenfalls wichtig war die Möglichkeit der parallelisierten Anwendung der Devices, um mehrere Zelllinien, Zellisolate oder Wirkstoffe gleichzeitig und zeitsparend messen zu können. Potentielle Anwendungsgebiete dieser Methode sind das Sekundärscreening von Kombinations-Wirkstoffkandidaten und die Diagnostik von Krebspatienten für eine individeulle Behandlung mit Chemotherapeutika. Zusätzlich wurden für die Mikroarray-Arbeit "stimulus {{dependence of}} the action of small-molecule inhibitors in the CD 3 /CD 28 signaling network" (Kohler et al. 2008), kombinatorische Experimente mit T-Zellen durchgeführt. Hier wurde gezeigt, dass die unterschiedliche Gewichtung von CD 3 /CD 28 Stimulationen zu unerwarteten Ergebnissen bei der Testung von Kinaseinhibitoren führen kann. Dafür wurden verschiedene Kinaseinhibitoren und auch kleine inhibitorische Moleküle, wie Ciclosporin und FK 506, die den T-Zell Signalweg beinflussen können, angewendet. Als Messgröße für die Stimulation der T-Zellen wurde die IL- 2 Expression herangezogen und mittels ELISA bestimmt. In experiments with <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>substances,</b> pipetting steps in standard micro plate methods increases exponentially {{with the number of}} substances and the concentrations which should be tested. Minimizing these pipetting steps in combi-natorial experiments could mean a good improvement for further methodical development. In the clinical application of chemotherapeutics primarily empirical findings are crucial. Thereby patient subgroups which don't or less respond to a certain drug combination are often not considered. The approach of the preclinical method presented in this dissertation with which individual patient responses could be foreknown, can be an important development in the treatment of cancer patients. To reach these aims the phenomena of diffusion has been employed. Therefore a so called "diffusion device" has been invented. Due to an orthogonal arrangement of two diffusion directions we had the ability to create many substance mixtures. In this present dissertation the handling and function of the "diffusion device" has been optimized and a cell based bioassay has been implemented. Potential application areas for this approach are the secondary screening of drug candidates or the application in the field of individualized diagnostic. To accomplish this, first steps had been validation of all diffusion parameters of the diffusion device. Then chemotherapeutic substances were tested against cancer cell lines and primary cancer cells. The implemented bioassays were an annexin linked apoptosis assay and a MTT-cytotoxicity assay. Priority laid on simple handling and low equipment usage. The next step after implementation of the bioassays has been an implementation of parallelization with which the testing of several cell lines or drug combinations at once could been showed. In addition of the microarray work "stimulus {{dependence of the}} action of small-molecule inhibitors in the CD 3 /CD 28 signaling network" (Kohler et al. 2008) combination experiments were carried out with t-cells. It was the aim to prove that different t-cell stimuli can lead to an unexpected result in kinase inhibitor testing. Therefore several kinase inhibitors had been applied as well as ciclosporin and FK 506 under different stimuli ratios of anti-CD 3 and anti-CD 28 antibodies. As readout the expression of the cytokine IL- 2 had been measured. Additionally some pharmacological kinase inhibitors which {{were not included in the}} microarray work of Kohler et al. had been used...|$|E
40|$|Driving {{and using}} {{prescription}} medicines {{that have the}} potential to impair driving is an emerging research area. To date it is characterised by a limited (although growing) number of studies and methodological complexities that make generalisations about impairment due to medications difficult. Consistent evidence has been found for the impairing effects of hypnotics, sedative antidepressants and antihistamines, and narcotic analgesics, although {{it has been estimated that}} as many as nine medication classes {{have the potential to}} impair driving (Alvarez & del Rio, 2000; Walsh, de Gier, Christopherson, & Verstraete, 2004). There is also evidence for increased negative effects related to concomitant use of other medications and alcohol (Movig et al., 2004; Pringle, Ahern, Heller, Gold, & Brown, 2005). Statistics on the high levels of Australian prescription medication use suggest that consumer awareness of driving impairment due to medicines should be examined. One web-based study has found a low level of awareness, knowledge and risk perceptions among Australian drivers about the impairing effects of various medications on driving (Mallick, Johnston, Goren, & Kennedy, 2007). The lack of awareness and knowledge brings into question the effectiveness of the existing countermeasures. In Australia these consist of the use of ancillary warning labels administered under mandatory regulation and professional guidelines, advice to patients, and the use of Consumer Medicines Information (CMI) with medications that are known to cause impairment. The responsibility for the use of the warnings and related counsel to patients primarily lies with the pharmacist when dispensing relevant medication. A review by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) noted that in practice, advice to patients may not occur and that CMI is not always available (TGA, 2002). Researchers have also found that patients' recall of verbal counsel is very low (Houts, Bachrach, Witmer, Tringali, Bucher, & Localio, 1998). With healthcare observed as increasingly being provided in outpatient conditions (Davis et al., 2006; Vingilis & MacDonald, 2000), establishing the effectiveness of the warning labels as a countermeasure is especially important. There have been recent international developments in medication categorisation systems and associated medication warning labels. In 2005, France implemented a four-tier medication categorisation and warning system to improve patients' and health professionals' awareness and knowledge of related road safety issues (AFSSAPS, 2005). This warning system uses a pictogram and indicates the level of potential impairment in relation to driving performance through the use of colour and advice on the recommended behaviour to adopt towards driving. The comparable Australian system does not indicate the severity level of potential effects, and does not provide specific guidelines on the attitude or actions that the individual should adopt towards driving. It is reliant upon the patient to be vigilant in self-monitoring effects, to understand the potential ways in which they may be affected and how serious these effects may be, and to adopt the appropriate protective actions. This thesis investigates the responses of a sample of Australian hospital outpatients who receive appropriate labelling and counselling advice about potential driving impairment due to prescribed medicines. It aims to provide baseline data on the understanding and use of relevant medications by a Queensland public hospital outpatient sample recruited through the hospital pharmacy. It includes an exploration and comparison of the effect of the Australian and French medication warning systems on medication user knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and behaviour, and explores whether there are areas in which the Australian system may be improved by including any beneficial elements of the French system. A total of 358 outpatients were surveyed, and a follow-up telephone survey was conducted with a subgroup of consenting participants who were taking at least one medication that required an ancillary warning label about driving impairment. A complementary study of 75 French hospital outpatients was also conducted to further investigate the performance of the warnings. Not surprisingly, medication use among the Australian outpatient sample was high. The ancillary warning labels required to appear on medications that can impair driving were prevalent. A subgroup of participants was identified as being potentially at-risk of driving impaired, based on their reported recent use of medications requiring an ancillary warning label and level of driving activity. The sample reported previous behaviour and held future intentions that were consistent with warning label advice and health protective action. Participants did not express a particular need for being advised by a health professional regarding fitness to drive in relation to their medication. However, it was also apparent from the analysis that the participants would be significantly more likely to follow advice from a doctor than a pharmacist. High levels of knowledge in terms of general principles about effects of alcohol, illicit drugs and <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>substances,</b> and related health and crash risks were revealed. This may reflect a sample specific effect. Emphasis is placed in the professional guidelines for hospital pharmacists that make it essential that advisory labels are applied to medicines where applicable and that warning advice is given to all patients on medication which may affect driving (SHPA, 2006, p. 221). The research program applied selected theoretical constructs from Schwarzer's (1992) Health Action Process Approach, which has extended constructs from existing health theories such as the Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen, 1991) to better account for the intention-behaviour gap often observed when predicting behaviour. This was undertaken to explore the utility of the constructs in understanding and predicting compliance intentions and behaviour with the mandatory medication warning about driving impairment. This investigation revealed that the theoretical constructs related to intention and planning to avoid driving if an effect from the medication was noticed were useful. Not all the theoretical model constructs that had been demonstrated to be significant predictors in previous research on different health behaviours were significant in the present analyses. Positive outcome expectancies from avoiding driving were found to be important influences on forming the intention to avoid driving if an effect due to medication was noticed. In turn, intention was found to be a significant predictor of planning. Other selected theoretical constructs failed to predict compliance with the Australian warning label advice. It is possible that the limited predictive power of a number of constructs including risk perceptions is due to the small sample size obtained at follow up on which the evaluation is based. Alternately, it is possible that the theoretical constructs failed to sufficiently account for issues of particular relevance to the driving situation. The responses of the Australian hospital outpatient sample towards the Australian and French medication warning labels, which differed according to visual characteristics and warning message, were examined. In addition, a complementary study with a sample of French hospital outpatients was undertaken in order to allow general comparisons concerning the performance of the warnings. While a large amount of research exists concerning warning effectiveness, there is little research that has specifically investigated medication warnings relating to driving impairment. General established principles concerning factors that have been demonstrated to enhance warning noticeability and behavioural compliance have been extrapolated and investigated in the present study. The extent to which there is a need for education and improved health messages on this issue was a core issue of investigation in this thesis. Among the Australian sample, the size of the warning label and text, and red colour were the most visually important characteristics. The pictogram used in the French labels was also rated highly, and was salient for a large proportion of the sample. According to the study of French hospital outpatients, the pictogram was perceived to be the most important visual characteristic. Overall, the findings suggest that the Australian approach of using a combination of visual characteristics was important for the majority of the sample but that the use of a pictogram could enhance effects. A high rate of warning recall was found overall and a further important finding was that higher warning label recall was associated with increased number of medication classes taken. These results suggest that increased vigilance and care are associated with the number of medications taken and the associated repetition of the warning message. Significantly higher levels of risk perception were found for the French Level 3 (highest severity) label compared with the comparable mandatory Australian ancillary Label 1 warning. Participants' intentions related to the warning labels indicated that they would be more cautious while taking potentially impairing medication displaying the French Level 3 label compared with the Australian Label 1. These are potentially important findings for the Australian context regarding the current driving impairment warnings about displayed on medication. The findings raise other important implications for the Australian labelling context. An underlying factor may be the differences in the wording of the warning messages that appear on the Australian and French labels. The French label explicitly states "do not drive" while the Australian label states "if affected, do not drive", and the difference in responses may reflect that less severity is perceived where the situation involves the consumer's self-assessment of their impairment. The differences in the assignment of responsibility by the Australian (the consumer assesses and decides) and French (the doctor assesses and decides) approaches for the decision to drive while taking medication raises the core question of who is most able to assess driving impairment due to medication: the consumer, or the health professional? There are pros and cons related to knowledge, expertise and practicalities with either option. However, if the safety of the consumer is the primary aim, then the trend towards stronger risk perceptions and more consistent and cautious behavioural intentions in relation to the French label suggests that this approach may be more beneficial for consumer safety. The observations from the follow-up survey, although based on a small sample size and descriptive in nature, revealed that just over half of the sample recalled seeing a warning label about driving impairment on at least one of their medications. The majority of these respondents reported compliance with the warning advice. However, the results indicated variation in responses concerning alcohol intake and modifying the dose of medication or driving habits so that they could continue to drive, which suggests that the warning advice may not be having the desired impact. The findings of this research have implications for current countermeasures in this area. These have included enhancing the role that prescribing doctors have in providing warnings and advice to patients about the impact that their medication can have on driving, increasing consumer perceptions of the authority of pharmacists on this issue, and the reinforcement of the warning message. More broadly, it is suggested that there would be benefit in a wider dissemination of research-based information on increased crash risk and systematic monitoring and publicity about the representation of medications in crashes resulting in injuries and fatalities. Suggestions for future research concern the continued investigation of the effects of medications and interactions with existing medical conditions and other substances on driving skills, effects of variations in warning label design, individual behaviours and characteristics (particularly among those groups who are dependent upon prescription medication) and validation of consumer self-assessment of impairment...|$|E
