50|$|In {{contrast}} to the first engine, 61 002, which was built later, had a drive with three cylinders and larger supply tanks. To support the latter, the rear <b>carrying</b> <b>bogie</b> was extended to three axles. As {{a result of the}} more powerful drive, the punctuality of the train was improved - it had been unsatisfactory with 61 001. In addition the second locomotive had smoke deflectors on top next to the smoke exhaust, which were not fitted to 61 001.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{individual}} components or systems such as, for example, the boiler, the <b>carrying</b> <b>bogies,</b> etc., {{for as many}} classes as possible, enabled considerable savings to be achieved in construction, in repair and in the stocks of spares parts needed.|$|R
50|$|Kim Il-sung's longest train journey {{took place}} in 1984 when he visited almost every socialist country in Eastern Europe. The train ride went via China, through the Soviet Union, with stops in Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Romania. The rest of the trip went through the Soviet Union, again. A second train {{accompanied}} Kim's <b>carrying</b> <b>bogies</b> (wheels and axles) of the other gauge (sizes) needed.|$|R
50|$|Most diesel {{locomotives}} and electric locomotives are <b>carried</b> on <b>bogies.</b> Those {{used in the}} USA include AAR type A switcher truck, Blomberg B, HT-C truck and Flexicoil.|$|R
500|$|Class 73 is a four-car {{electric}} {{multiple unit}} built by Adtranz. Each four-car train has eight bogies—of which three are powered—with a total power output of [...] The trains have active tilting, which allows speeds 20 to 30 {{percent higher than}} conventional trains through curves on conventional lines. Maximum permitted speed is [...] A four-car train is [...] long; an A-series weighs [...] while a B-series unit weighs [...] The trains have a steel body and the entire cabin is pressurized. Rail brakes are installed on all <b>carrying</b> <b>bogies.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Bolster wagons are {{relatively}} lightweight. Heavier well wagon, for machinery loads, had deeper and stronger side girders. They had a cranked profile from the side, {{so that the}} load's centre of gravity was <b>carried</b> lower. <b>Bogie</b> bolsters could <b>carry</b> typical loads of 15 or 30 tons.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} way to <b>carry</b> out <b>bogie</b> exchange is {{to lift the}} wagons off the bogies and replace them back on new bogies. This may require the wagons in a train to be uncoupled, and continuous brakes disconnected. As the bogies are swung out of the way, they sway, which wastes time settling them down.|$|R
50|$|Another way of <b>carrying</b> out <b>bogie</b> {{exchange}} is {{to lower the}} bogies onto a trolley in a pit, after which the trolleys are rolled {{out of the way}} and others return. This keeps the train couplings and continuous brakes connected. In addition, the bogies never need leave a solid surface, so they can be wheeled in and out more quickly. This method was used at Dry Creek railway station, Adelaide.|$|R
50|$|The {{tractive}} force was transmitted from the drive axles to the bogies. From there the force was <b>carried</b> to the <b>bogie</b> mounted towing hook and the buffers. The bogies were connected {{together with a}} so-called short coupling. The locomotive body did not carry any {{tractive force}}s.|$|R
50|$|From {{the late}} 1920s onwards {{passenger}} trains ran faster, and less running time meant that on-board sorting of mail {{was no longer}} practical. As a result, the onboard mail sorting carriages were removed and converted to other uses, with mail instead being <b>carried</b> in standard <b>bogie</b> boxvans or louvre vans.|$|R
50|$|The 12645 / 46 Ernakulam Hazrat Nizamuddin Millennium Express has 1 AC 2 tier, 2 AC 3 tier, 11 Sleeper Class, 3 General Unreserved & 2 SLR (Seating cum Luggage Rake) Coaches. It {{does not}} carry a Pantry car coach but <b>carries</b> a green <b>bogie</b> for {{movement}} {{of fruits and}} vegetables http://www.thehindu.com/2002/04/13/stories/2002041303430600.htm.|$|R
30|$|Initially, {{the first}} tank was {{designed}} without suspension used in WW 1 on the British tanks. Later variations had the tracks on big modules {{connected to the}} hull with a girder, like the Whippet [1]. From the period of WW 1 until WW 2, the direct coil bogie [2] was adopted which {{is a form of}} suspension, with single or multiple coil springs <b>carrying</b> a <b>bogie.</b> This was a big improvement, but still only capable of very minimal travel. Later versions were invented to allow it to pivot and help with interconnection, but still limited {{by the size of the}} compressed spring [2].|$|R
5000|$|One {{example was}} the Italian State Railways class 640 2-6-0. The frontmost axle did not carry a {{conventional}} pony truck. Instead this axle {{along with the}} front driven axle together <b>carried</b> a <b>bogie.</b> This driving axle had a lateral play of about 20 mm, and spherical bearings were used on the cranks and coupling rods to this axle. (The engine used inside cylinders driving the middle set of drivers.) The first two axles worked together to guide the locomotive, similar to a conventional leading bogie. The Dovregubben class 2-8-4 on the Norwegian State Railways also used this [...] "Zara" [...] truck.|$|R
50|$|The vehicle has {{an overall}} length of 35,400 mm {{and a maximum}} speed of 70 km/h. It {{consists}} of three sections {{with a total of}} four bogies. Two of these support the middle section of the car, while the two end sections are <b>carried</b> by a <b>bogie</b> each. The end section bogies are driven, which is why {{it was not possible to}} create a low floor above them as elsewhere in the car. Altogether the GT8N-1 is 74% low floor.|$|R
2500|$|The {{suspension}} {{used two}} axles, {{each of which}} <b>carried</b> a two-wheel <b>bogie</b> to which {{a second set of}} bogies was connected with a leaf spring. Upward movement of either set of bogies would force the other down through the spring. This was considered to be a fairly good system and offered better than normal cross-country performance although it could not compare with the contemporary Christie suspension. High strength steel tracks gave over [...] of life which was considerably better than most designs of the era.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{of these other}} shapes {{is known as a}} drum ladle and is shaped as a {{horizontal}} cylinder suspended between two bogies. Large versions, often having capacities in excess of 100 tonnes are used in steel mills are often referred to as torpedo ladles. Torpedo ladles are commonly used to transport liquid iron from a blast furnace {{to another part of the}} steel mill. Some versions are even adapted so that they can be <b>carried</b> on special <b>bogies</b> that can be transported by either road or rail.|$|R
5000|$|The {{suspension}} {{consisted of}} three bogies per side—each formed of two bell cranks arranged as [...] "scissors" [...] with springs at the top. Each <b>bogie</b> <b>carried</b> two rubber-rimmed wheels. The first ten production vehicles, which {{can be considered as}} forming a separate preseries, had curved bogie sides; in later vehicles the bogies had straight sides. The bogies superficially resembled the R35 type, but used horizontal helical springs instead of rubber cylinders. The sprocket was at the front, the idler—which itself was sprung to automatically control tension—at the rear. There were two top rollers.|$|R
50|$|Only a {{very small}} number of Mark 1 stock was fitted with the B4 bogie from new, it being used on the Mark 1 only to replace worn BR1 bogies. The British Rail Mark 2 coach, however, <b>carried</b> the B4 <b>bogies</b> from new. A heavier-duty version, the B5, was {{standard}} on Southern Region Mk1-based EMUs from the 1960s onwards. Some Mark 1 catering cars had mixed bogies—a B5 under the kitchen end, and a B4 under the seating end. Some of the B4-fitted Mark 2s, as well as many B4-fitted Mark 1 BGs were allowed to run at 110 mph with extra maintenance, particularly of the wheel profile, and more frequent exams.|$|R
5000|$|The {{order was}} made up of 192 motor cars and 228 trailers. The motor cars had wooden bodies on steel underframes and one motored bogie {{containing}} two GE69 traction motors each rated at [...] controlled with British Thomson-Houston (BTH) equipment. Both <b>bogies</b> <b>carried</b> shoegear, that were connected together by a power bus line. One hundred and twenty end motor cars had one driving position, the reminder with two diving positions were intended for the centre of trains. Twenty end motor cars were built with luggage compartments but these were soon replaced with seating. The trailer cars were built entirely of wood, thirty two having driving positions. The trains were fitted with the Westinghouse air brake.|$|R
50|$|Ex-Queensland Railways PB15 class locomotive, Number 448 {{has been}} the main stay of the railway and {{following}} a 10 year overhaul is fully restored in working order. It is one of over two hundred locomotives of this class to be purchased by the Queensland Railways, this engine was built by Walkers Ltd. Maryborough, Queensland {{to the design of}} locomotive engineer H. Horniblow, and was allocated construction number 91 of 1908. The tender, which is carried on two four wheel <b>bogies</b> <b>carries</b> 4 Ton (4064 kg) of coal and 1800 gallons (81231) of water. It was sold to K.R. Hunter's Pioneer Valley Amusement Park after its retirement in August 1970, from where a group of Ipswich and Brisbane enthusiasts purchased it on that venture's failure.|$|R
500|$|There {{were three}} batches of Class 455s, all {{consisting}} of four cars: driving carriages at each end, an intermediate trailer vehicle and an intermediate motorised vehicle (powered by four EE507-20J of 185kW <b>carried</b> on the <b>bogies</b> of the MSO vehicle, some recovered from Class 405s), all originally built {{to the standard}} class 3+2 seating arrangement with 316 seats. Technically, they are formed DTSO+MSO+TSO+DTSO. They have the same bodyshell as the [...] and , but as they were designed for inner suburban services they do not feature first class seating, air conditioning or toilet facilities and are restricted to 75mph (121km/h). Like the Class 317/318, {{as well as the}} diesel , they are based on the British Rail Mark 3, with a steel construction, unlike the earlier PEP based , , , [...] and , which had an aluminium alloy body.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} {{was very}} complex with sixteen road wheels per side. There were three large central bogies, sprung by a vertical coil spring. Each central <b>bogie</b> <b>carried</b> two smaller ones. The three vertical springs moved through holes in a horizontal beam, to both extreme ends {{of which road}} wheels were attached by means of leaf springs: three at the front and one at the back. The high track run gave the tank an old fashioned look, reflecting its long development time. It had a maximum speed of 28 km/h and a weight of 28 metric tons. The range was about 200 km. A total of 34 vehicles were built from December 1935 until July 1937. They had series numbers 102 to 135. Chassis number 101 was kept apart to build the Char B1 ter prototype.|$|R
50|$|The {{de-icing}} <b>bogies</b> <b>carried</b> ice-cutters, {{which were}} held {{against the current}} rail by a compressed air cylinder. Each had a rotating head with ridged steel rollers, {{to break up the}} ice. Sleet brushes with metal prongs were mounted either side of the cutter, so that the rail was swept before and after cutting, whichever way the locomotive was moving. Anti-freeze was applied to the rail by spray nozzles, supplied from a tank mounted in the central section, and accessible through a sliding door. Two operators were required, one to drive and the other to operate valves, so that when the current rail changed sides, the application of anti-freeze followed. In 1955, the process was upgraded, and the detection of the current rail was made automatic. When there was no rail, the sprays shut down, as they also did when the locomotive stopped.|$|R
50|$|There {{were three}} batches of Class 455 units, all {{consisting}} of 4 cars: driving carriages at each end, an intermediate trailer vehicle and an intermediate motorised vehicle (powered by four EE507-20J of 185 kW <b>carried</b> on the <b>bogies</b> of the MSO vehicle, some recovered from Class 405), all originally built to the Standard Class 3+2 seating arrangement. Technically, they are formed DTSO+MSO+TSO+DTSO. They {{have the same}} bodyshell as the Class 317 and Class 318, but as they were designed for inner suburban services they do not feature first class seating, air conditioning or toilet facilities and are restricted to 75 mph (121 km/h). Like the Class 317/318, {{as well as the}} diesel Class 150, they are based on British Rail Mark 3 coaches, with a steel construction, unlike the earlier PEP-based Class 313s, 314s, 315s, 507s and 508s, which had an aluminium alloy body.|$|R
50|$|For {{the surface}} lines, two T Stock cars were {{converted}} into sleet locomotives in 1961. They were permanently coupled together, and never ran independently. The de-icing equipment was fitted {{to the inner}} motor bogies, rather than being <b>carried</b> by separate <b>bogies</b> as on the tube-sized sleet locomotives. The cars were renumbered ESL118A and ESL118B, previously being 2758 and 2749 respectively. The locomotives {{were part of a}} leaf clearing experiment between 1978 and 1979, when they were marshalled into a train containing a brake van, a flat car, and Metropolitan electric locomotive Sarah Siddons. The flat car had two 2000 imp gal water tanks and a Merlin bus engine mounted on it, which was used to spray water at high pressure onto the running rails. L149, a ballast motor car, replaced the sleet locomotives in 1979. In 1980, the flat truck was coupled between ESL118A and ESL118B to form a leaf cleaning train, and the high-pressure sprays were augmented by a mixture of sand and chromium or stainless steel granules, which was applied to the rails in a gel to improve adhesion. The metal granules ensured that the track signalling circuits continued to operate.After being withdrawn, both cars were preserved and are currently located at the Spa Valley Railway.|$|R
