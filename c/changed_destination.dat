2500|$|Nineteen convicts sailed away in Cyprus, having {{appointed}} one {{of their}} number, William Swallow, {{the only one with}} sailing experience, as sailing master. The mutineers first sailed to New Zealand, and then on to the Chatham Islands. There they plundeered the schooner Samuel of the seal skins her crew had gathered. From the Islands, Cyprus sailed for Tahiti, but then <b>changed</b> <b>destination</b> to Tonga. The mutineers landed at Keppel's Island, where Ferguson, the leader, and six others decided to remain. Swallow then sailed to Japan. From Japan Cyprus sailed to the Ladrones. There four more of the mutineers left the ship. Swallow sailed on to Canton. Eventually, the mutineers scuttled Cyprus near Canton and claimed that they were castaways from another vessel. Swallow and three others worked their passage back to Britain aboard the East Indiaman Charles Grant. However, a man the mutineers had left in Canton confessed and by chance his account reached Britain a week before Swallow and his last three companions arrived there. The mutineers were tried and two hanged. Swallow, and two others, were returned to Hobart, where one was hanged. Swallow died at Port Arthur.|$|E
6000|$|Raynal was of weaker mould, {{and showed}} {{that there had been}} a stratum of cant and {{borrowed}} formulas in his eloquence. He lived into the very darkest days, and watched the succession of events with a keen eye. His heart began to quail very early. Long before the bloodier times of the internecine war between the factions, and on the eve of the attempted flight of the king, he addressed a letter to the National Assembly (May 31, 1791). The letter is not wanting in firm and courageous phrases. [...] "I have long dared," [...] he began, [...] "to tell kings of their duties. Let me to-day tell the people of its errors, and the representatives of the people of the perils that menace us all." [...] He then proceeded to inveigh in his old manner, but with a new purpose and a <b>changed</b> <b>destination.</b> This time it was not kings and priests whom he denounced, but a government enslaved by popular tyranny, soldiers without discipline, chiefs without authority, ministers without resources, the rudest and most ignorant of men daring to settle the most difficult political questions. How comes it, he asks, that after declaring the dogma of the liberty of religious opinions, you allow priests to be overwhelmed by persecution and outrage because they do not follow your religious opinions? In the same energetic vein he protests against the failure of the Constituent Assembly to found a stable and vigorous government, and to put an end to the vengeances, the seditions, the outbreaks, that filled the air with confusion and menace. It was in short a vigorous pamphlet, written in the interest of Malouet and the constitutional royalists. The Assembly listened, but not without some rude interruptions. Robespierre hastened to the tribune. After condemning the tone of Raynal's letter, he disclaimed any intention of calling down the severity either of the Assembly or of public opinion upon a man who still preserved a great name; he thought that a sufficient excuse for the writer's apostasy might be found in his advanced age. The Assembly agreed with Robespierre, and passed to the order of the day.[173] ...|$|E

40|$|The floods of November 20 th 2009 {{destroyed}} or damaged {{four of the}} five bridges across the River Derwent at Workington, severing road and pedestrian access. Papcastle Bridge near Cockermouth, the closest road river crossing which involved a long detour, became a bottleneck with long delays for traffic in both directions. Many agencies worked hard to improve the situation and within ten days a temporary station had been built and a free train shuttle service instigated {{to make use of the}} remaining bridge. The army erected a footbridge in early December and provision was made for a shuttle bus between settlements on the north of the river, the new station and the footbridge. Thus, between December and April, there was an unusual situation with car journeys between the north and south of the area necessitating a long detour with considerable delays, while the half-hourly train service was free to use and pedestrian access was relatively easy. Cumbria County Council commissioned the Institute of Transport and Tourism of University of Central Lancashire to research the impact this had made on people’s travel. A household survey gave data on 435 people’s travel patterns for typical weeks in October 2009, before the floods, March 2010 while road access was difficult and May 2010 once the temporary road bridge had been opened. The survey found that the number of trips for all purposes had reduced in March and although it had risen again in May, it had not reached the previous levels. Leisure and social trips were the most reduced, partly because of the extra time needed for other travel. Shopping trips reduced and often <b>changed</b> <b>destination</b> and work trips showed most propensity for mode change. Although respondents’ car trips fell by nearly a half, the majority of trips were still made by car. Train travel increased by over 500...|$|E
40|$|The {{granting}} of credit, whose excessive diffusion {{was one of}} the causes of the economic and financial crisis of 2007, has suffered profound changes during the following period of economic recession. The {{granting of}} credit to households and businesses has been strongly influenced by the effects of the economic downturn, the banks’ choices and the intervention of the supervisory authorities. The credit, however, is also an instrument of monetary policy through which governments and central banks try to stimulate the economic growth. There are, nevertheless, several and complex limitations to the actions of banks and other financial intermediaries, information asymmetries and structural limits of the credit market. Should also be considered that in many Countries the economic recession had a strong influence on the choices and opportunities for all economic agents, making it difficult to lay the foundations for economic recovery. In the previous years, the lowering of standards of borrowers and the presence of low interest rates, setting the conditions for the so-called housing bubble. The subsequent reactions, the general worsening of the economy, the lack of funding and liquidity, in addition to the strict rules imposed by the supervisory authorities, have led banks to tighten securely controls on the characteristics of borrowers, being also obliged to put more attention on the composition of the balance sheet. Under these conditions, have risen subjects that do not meet the requirements to receive funding, {{and at the same time}} increased the difficulty to repay loans and interest. In this paper a multidimensional scaling analysis is used to observe the situation of credit in the Italian regions before and after the outbreak of the crisis, considering the average values for nine variables and for two different period, before and after 2007. Searching for dissimilarity between areas of the Country, is highlighted a clear separation before the crisis and remained essentially unchanged between northern and southern regions.
