We present Lark, a system that facilitates the coordination of interactions with information visualizations on shared digital workspaces.

These are achieved by integrating {{a representation of the}} information visualization pipeline into the shared workspace, thus explicitly indicating <b>coordination</b> <b>points</b> on data, representation, presentation, and view levels. This integrated meta-visualization supports both the awareness of how views are linked and the freedom to work in concert or independently.

40|$|Remarkable {{levels of}} {{coordination}} are observed among social agents; yet the exact {{mechanisms by which}} such agents coordinate are not well understood. Here we examine the role of communication in achieving coordination—in particular, does endowing agents {{with the ability to}} communicate lead to more favorable outcomes? To pursue this question we employ an adaptive model of strategically communicating agents (Miller et al. [7]) playing the Stag Hunt game. We find that communication {{plays a key role in}} the ability of agents to reach and maintain superior coordination. In the absence of communication, agents tend to get trapped at the inferior <b>coordination</b> <b>point.</b> However, once agents reach a particular strategic threshold, sending even a priori meaningless messages serves to increase the likelihood that the population will coordinate on the superior outcome. While the system spends the majority of its time with well-coordinated behavior, it is not static—such periods are often punctuated by brief transitions in which the system switches to the alternative <b>coordination</b> <b>point.</b> We analyze the various mechanisms that account for this dynamic behavior and find that there are a few critical pathways by which the system transitions from one <b>coordination</b> <b>point</b> to another. Communication plays a critical, yet short-lived, role in one key pathway. Our analysis suggests that giving agents the ability to communicate even a priori meaningless messages may promote the emergence of a rich, and often robust, “ecology ” of behaviors that allows agents to achieve new, and in this case superior, outcomes...|$|E
