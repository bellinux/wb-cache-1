40|$|UnrestrictedThis {{dissertation}} {{was designed}} {{to determine the effects}} of unilateral sensorimotor stroke on the ability to use initial planning and <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustments</b> for unconstrained reach actions. Three studies were organized to answer this question. First, because of the novel nature of the immersive virtual environment (VE), the measurement validity of the experimental paradigm was investigated. Second, to validate the VE for the study of unconstrained reach actions, task performance was compared between the VE and a real-world environment (RWE) in young, non-disabled adults. The final and most important study investigated the planning and adjustments of reach actions in individuals with sensorimotor stroke when moving with the ipsilesional and contralesional arm. To glean information about the perceived confidence of the performer, the relationship between reach performance and task-specific self-efficacy was examined.; After determination of the measurement validity of the VE, six young, non-disabled adults, 12 individuals with sensorimotor stroke (six with right brain damage and six with left brain damage), and six age-matched, non-disabled older adults were recruited. Participants performed goal-directed reach actions to six virtual targets that were presented in two directions (+ 45 ° and - 45 ° from center) and three distances (8, 16, and 24 cm) in a single data collection session. Younger, non-disabled participants reached with the right arm only but did so in two environments: the VE and an analogous RWE. Participants with mild to moderate motor impairment after stroke and the age-matched older, non-disabled adults reached separately with the right and left arms in the VE. Individuals rated their level of self-efficacy for reach accuracy and reach speed prior to each block of trials. Reach movement kinematics were used to characterize performance and to quantify the use of initial planning and <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustments</b> in all studies and participants.; Comparison of reach movements between the immersive VE and the RWE performed by younger, non-disabled participants revealed no significant difference in the control of these actions thereby validating the VE condition for future studies. Individuals relied on a control pattern that combined both anticipatory planning and <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustments</b> to achieve the actual movement distance. A similar pattern of control was observed for goal-directed reaches performed with the right and left arm in the older, non-disabled participants in the VE. Goal-directed reaches performed with the ipsilesional arm resembled those of the control group in the use of initial planning and <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustments.</b> However, reach actions performed with the contralesional arm tended to rely less on an initial plan and more on feedback based <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustments</b> compared to the matched arm in non-disabled controls. This trend was evident in both stroke groups (right brain damage, left brain damage) but only statistically significant for the right brain damage group for reach actions across midline. Additionally, individuals with right brain damage demonstrated changes in reach kinematics with both arms that suggested they were slowing down the speed of movement to improve endpoint accuracy, a finding unique to the right brain damage group. As expected, self-efficacy for reach accuracy and reach speed was lower for the contralesional arm than for the ipsilesional arm in both the right brain damage and left brain damage groups.; Overall, the use of initial planning and <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustments</b> in the ipsilesional arm after sensorimotor stroke did not differ from non-disabled controls. The contralesional arm demonstrated a decreased utilization of initial planning that was more significant in the right brain damage group than the left brain damage group. This change in control of goal-directed reach actions was reflected by a decrease in reach self-efficacy suggesting a perceptual awareness of paretic limb movement capability. Together, the findings of this dissertation provide a foundation for future research into the mechanisms of the control of goal-directed reach actions after stroke, the impact of training and practice conditions on that control, and the role of self-efficacy on the control and learning of these actions...|$|R

Through combining the automated tracking of winter flocks of over 500 wild great tits (Parus major) with removal experiments, we assessed how individuals’ social network positions responded {{to the loss of}} their social associates.

40|$|Reasons for the {{observed}} lag-time for clinical {{efficacy of the}} tricyclic antidepressant drug, protriptyline, have been investigated. Our results demonstrate that chronic protriptyline administration results in several compensatory neural mechanisms: (1) changes in endogeneous cytoplasmic norepinephrine levels, (2) changes in norepinephrine turnover rate/recovery rate following the last dose in a chronic series of test drug administrations and (3) adaptations of the pre-synaptic receptor. The time course for these adaptive changes parallel the time required for the onset of their clinical effectiveness. We propose that acutely {{the action of the}} tricyclics on norepinephrine re-uptake is largely negated by <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustments</b> in turnover rate of the neurotransmitter; but with chronic administration, adaptations in pre-synaptic alpha-receptors occur. This phenomena in turn reduces {{the extent to which the}} norepinephrine neurons can offset or compensate for the blockade of norepinephrine re-uptake.

40|$|To {{estimate}} {{the contributions of}} feedforward vs. feedback control systems in speech articulation, we analyzed the correspondence between initial and final kinematics in unperturbed tongue and jaw movements for consonant-vowel (CV) and vowel-consonant (VC) syllables. If movement extents and endpoints are highly predictable from early kinematic information, then the movements were most likely completed without substantial online corrections (feedforward control); if the correspondence between early kinematics and final amplitude or position is low, online adjustments may have altered the planned trajectory (feedback control) (Messier and Kalaska, 1999). Five adult speakers produced consonant-vowel (CV) and vowel-consonant (VC) syllables with high, mid, or low vowels while movements of the tongue and jaw were tracked electromagnetically. The correspondence between the kinematic parameters peak acceleration or peak velocity and movement extent {{as well as between}} the articulators’ spatial coordinates at those kinematic landmarks and movement endpoint was examined both for movements across different target distances (i. e., across vowel height) and within target distances (i. e., within vowel height). Taken together, results suggest that jaw and tongue movements for these CV and VC syllables are mostly under feedforward control but with feedback-based contributions. One type of feedback-driven <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustment</b> appears to regulate movement duration based on variation in peak acceleration.

40|$|Obesity {{is thought}} to lead to {{sympathetic}} overactivity as a <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustment</b> to weight gain. However, most of the experimental support for the hypothesis has been derived from white cohorts. Our previous study in blacks indicated that sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) is closely correlated with body mass index only in women, whereas, in black men, SNA is elevated and dissociated from adiposity (Abate et al., Hypertension 38 : 379 – 383, 2001). To further determine whether total and regional adiposity are determinants of SNA in blacks, we performed a prospective weight loss study in 12 normotensive obese black men and 9 obese black women. SNA, body mass index, and abdominal fat mass were measured before and 16 wk after hypocaloric diet. The major new findings are that, in obese black men, the dietary-induced weight loss of 11. 3 ± 0. 8 kg resulted in reduction in plasma leptin, insulin, and visceral abdominal fat but {{had no effect on}} SNA (from baseline of 26 ± 4 to 28 ± 3 bursts/min, P = not significant). In contrast, in black women, weight loss of 8. 0 ± 0. 9 kg caused similar reductions in plasma leptin, insulin, and visceral abdominal fat and led to a reduction in SNA by 40 % (from baseline of 22 ± 2 to 13 ± 3 bursts/min, P < 0. 05).

40|$|Poster presentation: Twenty Second Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting: CNS* 2013. Paris, France. 13 - 18 July 2013. Neuronal {{death and}} {{subsequent}} denervation of target areas {{is a major}} feature of several neurological conditions such as brain trauma, ischemia or neurodegeneration. The denervation-induced axonal loss results in reorganization of the dendritic tree of denervated neurons. Dendritic reorganization of denervated neurons has been previously studied using entorhinal cortex lesion (ECL). ECL leads to shortening and loss of dendritic segments in the denervated outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus [1]. However, the functional importance of these long-term dendritic alterations is not yet understood {{and their impact on}} neuronal electrical properties remains unclear. Therefore, in this study we analyzed what happens to the electrotonic structure and excitability of dentate granule cells after denervation-induced alterations of their dendritic morphology, assuming all other parameters remain equal. To perform comparative electrotonic analysis we used computer simulations in anatomically and biophysically realistic compartmental models of 3 D-reconstructed healthy and denervated granule cells. Our results show that somatofugal and somatopetal voltage attenuation due to passive cable properties was strongly reduced in denervated granule cells. In line with these predictions, the attenuation of simulated backpropagating action potentials and forward propagating EPSPs was significantly reduced in dendrites of denervated neurons. In addition, simulations of somatic and dendritic frequency-current (f-I) curves revealed increased excitability in deafferentated granule cells. Taken together, our results indicate that unless counterbalanced by a <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustment</b> of passive and/or active membrane properties, the plastic remodeling of dendrites following lesion of entorhinal cortex inputs to granule cells will boost their electrotonic compactness and excitability...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{effects of}} β(2) -agonists on human {{skeletal}} muscle contractile properties, particularly on slow fibers, are unclear. Moreover, {{it remains to}} be ascertained whether central motor drive (CMD) during voluntary contractions could counter for eventual contractile alterations induced by β(2) -agonists. This study investigated central and peripheral neuromuscular adjustments induced by β(2) -agonist terbutaline on a predominantly slow human muscle, the soleus. METHODS: Ten recreationally active men ingested either a single dose of 8 mg of terbutaline or placebo in a randomized double-blind order (two experimental sessions). Isometric plantarflexion torque was measured during single and tetanic (10 and 100 Hz) stimulations as well as during submaximal and maximal voluntary contractions (MVC). Twitch peak torque and half-relaxation time were calculated. CMD was estimated via soleus electromyographic recordings obtained during voluntary contractions performed at approximately 50 % MVC. RESULTS: MVC and twitch peak torque were not modified by terbutaline. Twitch half-relaxation time was 28 % shorter after terbutaline administration compared with placebo (P < 0. 001). Tetanic torques at 10 and 100 Hz were significantly lower after terbutaline intake compared with placebo (- 40 % and - 24 % respectively, P < 0. 001). Despite comparable torque of submaximal voluntary contractions in the two conditions, CMD was 7 % higher after terbutaline ingestion compared with placebo (P < 0. 01). CONCLUSION: These results provide evidence that terbutaline modulates the contractility of the slow soleus muscle and suggest that the increased CMD during submaximal contractions may be viewed as a <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the central nervous system to counter the weakening action induced by terbutaline on the contractile function of slow muscle fibers...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze whether quiet {{standing}} posture is related to <b>compensatory</b> postural <b>adjustment.</b> INTRODUCTION: The latest data in clinical practice suggests that static posture may play a significant role in musculoskeletal function, even in dynamic activities. However, no evidence exists regarding whether static posture during quiet standing is related to postural adjustment. METHODS: Twenty healthy participants standing on a movable surface underwent unexpected, standardized backward and forward postural perturbations while kinematic data were acquired; ankle, knee, pelvis and trunk positions were then calculated. An initial and a final video frame representing quiet standing posture and the end of the postural perturbation were selected in such a way that postural adjustments had occurred between these frames. The positions of the body segments were calculated in these initial and final frames, together with the displacement of body segments during postural adjustments between the initial and final frames. The relationship between the positions of body segments in the initial and final frames and their displacements over this time period was analyzed using multiple regressions with a significance level of p < 0. 05. RESULTS: We failed to identify a relationship between the position of the body segments in the initial and final frames and the associated displacement of the body segments. DISCUSSION: The motion pattern during <b>compensatory</b> postural <b>adjustment</b> is not related to quiet standing posture or to the final posture of <b>compensatory</b> postural <b>adjustment.</b> This fact should be considered when treating balance disturbances and musculoskeletal abnormalities.

This observation suggested a <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustment</b> in cognate receptors {{in the face of}} chronic GAL exposure. To evaluate the molecular alterations to GALR 2 and GALR 3 in the forebrain of GAL overexpressing mice, we performed complementary quantitative, real-time PCR (qPCR), in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry in select forebrain regions of GAL-tg mice to characterize the neuronal distribution and magnitude of GAL mRNA and peptide expression and the consequences of genetically manipulating the neuropeptide GAL on the expression of GALR 2 and GALR 3 receptors. We found that GAL-tg mice displayed dramatic increases in GAL mRNA and peptide in the frontal cortex, posterior cortex, hippocampus, septal diagonal band complex, amygdala, piriform cortex, and olfactory bulb. Moreover, there was evidence for ectopic neuronal GAL expression in forebrain limbic regions that mediate cognitive and affective behaviors, including the piriform and entorhinal cortex and amygdala. Interestingly, regional qPCR analysis failed to reveal any changes in GALR 2 or GALR 3 expression in the GAL-tg mice, suggesting that, contrary to GALR 1, these receptor genes are not under ligand-mediated regulatory control.

The fsI and beta II isoenzymes result from the alternative splicing of the PKC beta gene (PRKCB 1), previously found to be associated with autism. We performed a family-based association study in 229 simplex and 5 multiplex families, and a postmortem study of PRKCB 1 gene expression in temporocortical gray matter (BA 41 / 42) of 11 autistic patients and controls. PRKCB 1 gene haplotypes are significantly associated with autism (P < 0. 05) and have the autistic endophenotype of enhanced oligopeptiduria (P < 0. 05). Temporocortical PRKCB 1 gene expression was reduced on average by 35 and 31 % for the PRKCB 1 - 1 and PRKCB 1 - 2 isoforms (P < 0. 01 and < 0. 05, respectively) according to qPCR. Protein amounts measured for the PKC beta II isoform were similarly decreased by 35 % (P = 0. 05). Decreased gene expression characterized patients carrying the 'normal' PRKCB 1 alleles, whereas patients homozygous for the autism-associated alleles displayed mRNA levels comparable to those of controls. Whole genome expression analysis unveiled a partial disruption in the coordinated expression of PKC beta-driven genes, including several cytokines. These results confirm the association between autism and PRKCB 1 gene variants, point toward PKC beta roles in altered epithelial permeability, demonstrate a significant downregulation of brain PRKCB 1 gene expression in autism and suggest that it could represent a <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustment</b> aimed at limiting an ongoing dysreactive immune process.

At steady-state proportions of cytochromes, the proportion of PE and the rate of turnover of the phosphate in the phospholipids increased. All through an incorporation experiment of 1. 5 divisions, the specific activity of the phosphate of PG was twice that of phosphatidic acid (PA). The phosphate of PG turned over 1. 2 to 1. 5 times more rapidly than the phosphate of PA in cells with high and low cytochrome levels. If the PA was an accurate measure of the precursor for the cytidine- 5 ′-diphosphate-diglyceride, which in turn was the precursor of all the lipids, then the results of these experiments suggested that exchange reactions, in addition to synthesis from PA, were involved in phospholipid metabolism. These reactions were more sensitive to changes in oxygen concentration than was the growth rate...|$|E
40|$|Motor {{systems are}} highly adaptive. Both birds and humans {{compensate}} for synthetically induced {{shifts in the}} pitch (fundamental frequency) of auditory feedback stemming from their vocalizations. Pitch-shift compensation is partial {{in the sense that}} large shifts lead to smaller relative <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustments</b> of vocal pitch than small shifts. Also, compensation is larger in subjects with high motor variability. To formulate a mechanistic description of these findings, we adapt a Bayesian model of error relevance. We assume that vocal-auditory feedback loops in the brain cope optimally with known sensory and motor variability. Based on measurements of motor variability, optimal compensatory responses in our model provide accurate fits to published experimental data. Optimal compensation correctly predicts sensory acuity, which has been estimated in psychophysical experiments as just-noticeable pitch differences. Our model extends the utility of Bayesian approaches to adaptive vocal behaviors...|$|R
40|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{system needs}} {{the coordination of}} three subsystems: sensory, skeletal and central nervous system. The central nervous system (CNS) counteracts equilibrium perturbations by means of compensatory and anticipatory postural <b>adjustments</b> (APA). While <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustments</b> deal with actual perturbations of balance, the APA precede perturbations. The APA consist of preprogrammed activation of the muscles, according to task parameters [6] and are important to minimize the effects of planned postural perturbations. APA are specific to the movement, adapt to changes in external postural support by changing APA timing and magnitude. These APA are altered in Parkinson disease (PD) where have characterized by a reduced amplitude, an increased duration and a delayed onset of APA in tasks such as gait initiation.

This study was an examination of possible biases in student evaluations of faculty quality (SEFQ's) in graduate classes offered by the College of Education at Northern Illinois University. The nine potential sources of bias were the following: (1) the grade expected by the student, (2) the level of difficulty perceived by the student, (3) the major/non-major status of the course, (4) the required/elective status of the course, (5) the academic level of the student, (6) the academic level of the class, (7) the gender of the student, (8) the gender of the teacher, and (9) the size of the class. The data were gathered {{through the use of a}} survey instrument containing questions to assess both student characteristics and teaching quality. Nine hundred fifty-two students in 73 classes completed the instrument. The data were aggregated by class and subjected to regression analysis. Five of the nine independent variables were consistently significantly associated with SEFQ ratings. Higher expected grades, higher level of difficulty, major courses, elective courses, and male students were associated with higher SEFQ ratings. However, difficulty was significant only after adjusting for the effects of grade. Different combinations of these variables in regression analyses explained as much as 20 % to 26 % of the variance in SEFQ ratings. Interactions between teacher gender, graduate student level, and required/elective status increased the explained variance to levels as high as 39 %, but these interactions were based upon groups of students that were very small in number and may have been unique to the sample. Moreover, some of the associations between the independent variables and SEFQ ratings can be attributed to relationships which did not constitute bias. The findings support two central conclusions. SEFQ ratings are useful indicators upon which faculty personnel decisions, in part, can be based. However, the findings also indicate the likelihood of bias which, if substantiated in further research, will warrant <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustment</b> in the interpretation of SEFQ ratings...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{exposure}} of mammalian organism to morphine results in adaption to persistent high opioid tone through homeostatic adjustments. Our previous {{results indicated that}} in the frontal brain cortex (FBC) of rats exposed to morphine for 10 days, such a <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustment</b> was detected as large up-regulation of adenylylcyclases I (8 -fold) and II (2. 5 -fold). The other isoforms of AC (III-IX) were unchanged. Importantly, the increase of ACI and ACII was reversible as it disappeared after 20 days of morphine withdrawal. Changes of down-stream signaling molecules such as G proteins and adenylylcyclases should respond to and be preceded by primary changes proceeding at receptor level. Therefore in our present work, we addressed the problem of reversibility of the long-term morphine effects on μ-, δ- and κ-OR protein levels in FBC. Rats were exposed to increasing doses of morphine (10 - 40 mg/kg) for 10 days and sacrificed either 24 h (group +M 10) or 20 days (group +M 10 /-M 20) after the last dose of morphine in parallel with control animals (groups -M 10 and -M 10 /-M 20). Post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) fraction was prepared from forebrain cortex, resolved by 1 D-SDS-PAGE under non-dissociated (-DTT) and dissociated (+DTT) conditions, and analyzed for the content of μ-, δ- and κ-OR by immunoblotting with C- and N-terminus oriented antibodies. Significant down-regulation of δ-OR form exhibiting Mw ≈ 60 kDa was detected in PNS prepared from both (+M 10) and (+M 10 /-M 20) rats. However, the total immunoblot signals of μ-, δ- and κ-OR, respectively, were unchanged. Plasma membrane marker Na, K-ATPase, actin and GAPDH were unaffected by morphine in both types of PNS. Membrane-domain marker caveolin- 1 and cholesterol level increased in (+M 10) rats and this increase was reversed back to control level in (+M 10 /-M 20) rats. In FBC, prolonged {{exposure of}} rats to morphine results in minor (δ-OR) or no change (μ- and κ-OR) of opioid receptor content. The reversible increases of caveolin- 1 and cholesterol levels suggest participation of membrane domains in compensatory responses during opioid withdrawal.

40|$|The Eurasian Economic Community (EurAsEC) is an {{international}} economic organization designed to effectively promote {{the formation of a}} customs union and a single economic space among six CIS countries : Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Moldova, Ukraine, and Armenia have observer status. As a newborn child, the EurAsEC has yet to overcome internal and external challenges. The main internal challenge is arguably a two tiered legal system that has emerged as a result of diverse speed integration in the EurAsEC. The external challenge would be posed by (1) other regional integration projects with similar purposes and subject matter, and (2) the membership of EurAsEC countries in the WTO. With respect to other regional projects such as the Single Economic Space between Belarus, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Russia, {{there is a need to}} coordinate them with the EurAsEC. As for the WTO membership issue, EurAsEC countries opted for WTO accession in parallel with the formation of the customs union. Considering the fact that Kyrgyzstan has already entered the WTO, and the remaining members are at different accession stages, the pursued parallelism is certainly very challenging for the affected EurAsEC countries. The formation of the EurAsEC customs union will have certain implications for third-party countries. First, products from third countries will be subject to the CCT and common non-tariff barriers at the EurAsEC external borders while they will be able to freely move inside the single customs territory with the biggest market in the CIS. Second, the EurAsEC customs union, once established, will be able to enter, on behalf of its members, into trade arrangements with third countries. Third, the coordinated WTO accession policy of EurAsEC countries may produce for WTO members similar market access opportunities to these countries. Fourth, the alteration of the bound duties of Kyrgyzstan and possibly other EurAsEC members that will have joined the WTO prior to the formation of the customs union will require them to negotiate <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustment</b> with the WTO members concerned. Finally, in the future the EurAsEC customs union may become a WTO member with a new voice in WTO decision making.

40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to evaluate the}} influence of using an unstable shoe in muscle recruitment strategies and center of pressure (CoP) displacement after the application of an external perturbation. Fourteen healthy female subjects participated in this study. The electromyographic activity of medial gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, rectus femoris, biceps femoris, rectus abdominis and erector spinae muscles and the kinetic values to calculate the CoP were collected and analyzed after the application of an external perturbation with the subject in standing position, with no shoes and using unstable footwear. The results showed increased in medial gastrocnemius activity during the first <b>compensatory</b> postural <b>adjustments</b> and late <b>compensatory</b> postural <b>adjustments</b> when using an unstable shoe. There were no differences in standard deviation and maximum peak of anteroposterior displacement of CoP between measurements. From the experimental findings, one can conclude {{that the use of}} an unstable shoe leads to an increase in gastrocnemius activity with no increase in CoP displacement following an unexpected external perturbation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compared}} the performance metrics of drivers {{who carried out}} visual-manipulative and auditory in-vehicle tasks while driving. Although these {{two different types of}} secondary tasks resulted in similar levels of self-reported workload, performing the visual tasks had a much greater impact on measurements of lateral control and resulted in greater compensatory behavior. While performing the auditory tasks, the overlap in drivers' processing resources was less than that of the visual task. However, competition over cognitive (or central) resources was revealed through the drivers' eye movements. A reduction in the allocation of visual attention, as observed through the concentration of gaze while performing the auditory tasks, suggests that tasks involving an increase in cognitive workload can also impact driving performance. The impact on performance can cause safety concerns as drivers' <b>compensatory</b> <b>adjustments</b> have been observed to result in slower reaction times. These findings are consistent with the Multiple Resources Theory [1] and provide some quantitative support for the theory...|$|R
