40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} (LAB) {{are common}} {{inhabitants of the}} gastrointestinal (GI) tract and have important role in maintaining the equilibrium of GI flora, which can be influenced by various factors like diets, antimicrobials and stress. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of 6 antibiotics, commonly used in human medicine for 8 selected lactobacilli strains were determined by macrodilution and microdilution methods in liquid media and by diffusion method on agar plates. The effects of Penicillin G and Ampicillin on intestinal LAB were tested in vivoon mice as well. Lactobacilli were sensitive to Penicillin G, (penicillines and their derivatives) and Erythromycin (macrolides) by in vitro testing. <b>Clyndamycin</b> (pyranosid) showed moderate inhibitory effect. All lactobacilli strains were resistant to Kanamycin and Neomycin (aminoglycosides), while L. salivarius IM 124 has shown extra resistance to Erythromycin and <b>Clyndamycin.</b> The influence of orally administered Ampicillin showed no significant influence on LAB count in mice faeces. The effect of Penicillin G on mice LAB total count was significant, while no effect of orally administered lactobacilli was determined...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{longitudinal}} study performed ina 159 medicine student’s cohort, of fourth andninth study semester, in order to evaluate thevariation of Staphylococcus aureus carriers andits antimicrobial susceptibility on students, beforeand after clinical practice. Clinical sampleswere taken with a swab from the tonsils, pharynxposterior wall, nasal fosses and hands and werecultured in 5 % sheep blood and incubated at 37 oC in aerobic conditions during 48 hours. The identification of Sthaphylococcus aureuswas performed according to the phenotypic andbiochemical test. The antimicrobial susceptibilitywas evaluated by the diffusion disc methodusing the Kirby-Bauer technique, accordingto Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute(CLSI), with the following antibiotics: Ciprofloxacyn,Vancomycin, Oxacyclin, Cephalotine,Clyndamycin, and Ryphampycin. The averageage of the fourth semester students was 19. 1 ± 1, 2 years and the female gender was 2 / 1 morefrequent than the male. The history of infections,allergy, smoke habit, non infectious diseases,surgeries, antibiotic use during the last threemonths and hospitalizations six months beforesampling was analyzed. There was no significantrelationship between previous history analysisand the carrier state incidence (p= 0. 001 Mc Nemarexact Test). A significant increase of 15, 1 %for S. aureus carrier state was observed afterthree years of exposure to hospital environmenton ninth semester students, compared to fourthsemester students (p= 0. 001 Test Mc Nemar);from which 16. 4 % (p< 0. 001) was founded inhands, 13. 8 % in nasal fosses (p= 0. 0015) and 3. 2 % in pharynx. 35. 8 % of S. aureus carrierwas persistent: 25. 2 % in nasal fosses, 4. 4 % inpharynx and 3. 8 % in hands. Antimicrobial resistancewas observed in 1. 9 % of the bacterialstrains isolated from fourth semester students:One to Ciprofloxacyn and two to <b>Clyndamycin.</b> Besides was observed 2. 5 % of bacterial strainsisolated from ninth semester students: one toCiprofloxacyn, Oxacyclin, Cephalotine andClyndamycin, one to Cephalotine and Oxacyclinand two to <b>Clyndamycin.</b> Finally, MethycylinResistant Sthaphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) strains were isolated from 1. 3 % of the studiedgroup. This results didn’t show significant differences(p= 1. 000) ...|$|E
40|$|Objective There is {{a global}} call for formulations, which are better suited for {{children}} of different age categories and {{in a variety of}} settings. One key public health area of interest is age-appropriate paediatric antibiotics. We aimed to identify clinically relevant paediatric formulations of antibiotics listed on pertinent formularies that were not on the WHO Essential Medicines List for Children (EMLc). Methods We compared four medicines lists versus the EMLc and contrasted paediatric antibiotic formulations in relation to administration routes, dosage forms and/or drug strengths. The additional formulations on comparator lists that differed from the EMLc formulations were evaluated for their added clinical values and costs. Results The analysis was based on 26 EMLc antibiotics. Seven oral and two parenteral formulations were considered clinically relevant for paediatric use. Frequently quoted benefits of oral formulations included: filling the gap of unmet therapeutic needs in certain age/weight groups (phenoxymethylpenicillin and metronidazole oral liquids, and nitrofurantoin capsules), and simplified administration and supply advantages (amoxicillin dispersible tablets, <b>clyndamycin</b> capsules, cloxacillin tablets, and sulfamethoxazole+trimethoprim tablets). Lower doses of ampicillin and cefazolin powder for injection could simplify the dosing in newborns and infants, reduce the risk of medical errors, and decrease the waste of medicines, but may target only narrow age/weight groups. Conclusions The identified additional formulations of paediatric antibiotics on comparator lists may offer clinical benefits for low-resource settings, including simplified administration and increased dosing accuracy. The complexity of both procuring and managing multiple strengths and formulations also needs to be considered...|$|E
40|$|Pregnant {{women have}} {{a higher risk of}} malaria {{compared}} to non-pregnant women. This review provides an update on knowledge acquired in the past decade on P. falciparum and P. vivax infections in pregnancy. Maternal risk factors for malaria in pregnancy (MiP) include low maternal age, low gravidity, and low gestational age. The effects of MIP include maternal anaemia, low birth weight (LBW), preterm delivery and increased infant mortality. P. falciparum infected erythrocytes sequester in the placenta by expressing surface antigens, mainly variant surface antigen (VAR 2 CSA), that bind to specific receptors, mainly chondroitin sulphate A. In stable transmission settings, the higher malaria risk in primigravidae {{can be explained by the}} non recognition of these surface antigens by the immune system. Recently, placental sequestration has been described also for P. vivax infections. The mechanism of preterm delivery and intrauterine growth retardation is not completely understood, but fever (preterm delivery), anaemia, and high cytokines levels have been implicated.        Clinical suspicion of MiP should be confirmed by parasitological diagnosis. The sensitivity of microscopy, with placenta histology as the gold standard, is 60 % and 45 % for peripheral and placental falciparum infections, respectively. Compared to microscopy, RDTs have a lower sensitivity. Insecticide treated nets (ITN) and intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) are recommended for the prevention of MiP in stable transmission settings. ITNs have been shown to reduce malaria infection and adverse pregnancy outcomes by 28 - 47 %. Although resistance is a concern, SP has been shown to be equivalent to MQ and AQ for IPTp. For the treatment of uncomplicated malaria, a combination of quinine + <b>clyndamycin</b> is recommended in all trimesters, while artesunate+ clindamycin or any other ACT known to be effective in the region are recommended in the second and third trimesters. For severe malaria, quinine (parenteral) is recommended in the first trimester while artesunate (parenteral) is recommended in the second and third trimesters...|$|E
