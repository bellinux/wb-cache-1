5|$|Louis Prang {{was born}} 12 March 1824 in Breslau. At {{the age of}} 13 he began apprenticing for his father and learned to dye and print calico, as well as wood and metal engraving. Prang emigrated to Boston in 1850 and became an {{illustrator}} {{for a number of}} local publications. Starting a business partnership in 1856 to manufacture copper and lithographic plates, Prang became sole proprietor in 1860 and named the company L. Prang & Co. He specialized in <b>color</b> <b>printing,</b> more specifically “chromolithography” Prang spent over four decades studying and creating a standard of colors and engraved and printed maps, prints of contemporary celebrities, and color reproductions of famous works of art.|$|E

25|$|Big Painting No. 6 (1965) {{became the}} highest priced Lichtenstein work in 1970. Like the entire Brushstrokes series, {{the subject of}} the {{painting}} is the process of Abstract Expressionist painting via sweeping brushstrokes and drips, but the result of Lichtenstein's simplification that uses a Ben-Day dots background is a representation of the mechanical/industrial <b>color</b> <b>printing</b> reproduction.|$|E
25|$|FreeHand 1.0 {{sold for}} $495 in 1988. It {{included}} the standard drawing tools and features as other draw programs including special effects in fills and screens, text manipulation tools, and full support for CMYK <b>color</b> <b>printing.</b> It was {{also possible to}} create and insert PostScript routines anywhere within the program. FreeHand performed in preview mode instead of keyline mode but performance was slower.|$|E
25|$|Fiborgtangen {{had about}} 700 {{employees}} during the 1980s. From 1984 {{and the following}} years {{there was an increase}} in newsprint demand. Customers demanded better quality paper, particularly aimed at more advanced offset printing and <b>color</b> <b>printing.</b> To remain competitive Norske Skog needed both to improve quality and cut production costs. This was achieved through the rationalization program NT90, which ran from 1986 through 1991. Total costs reached NOK2 billion. A quarter of this was financed through issuing new shares.|$|E

25|$|When color reproductions are made, {{the image}} is {{separated}} into its component colors by taking multiple photographs filtered for each color. One resultant film or plate represents each of the cyan, magenta, yellow, and black data. <b>Color</b> <b>printing</b> is a binary system, where ink is either present or not present, so all color separations to be printed must be translated into dots at some stage of the work-flow. Traditional line screens which are amplitude modulated had problems with moiré but were used until stochastic screening became available. A stochastic (or frequency modulated) dot pattern creates a sharper image.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{reproduction}} of colors, especially in professional environments, requires color management {{of all the}} devices involved in the production process, many of them using RGB. Color management results in several transparent conversions between device-independent and device-dependent color spaces (RGB and others, as CMYK for <b>color</b> <b>printing)</b> during a typical production cycle, {{in order to ensure}} color consistency throughout the process. Along with the creative processing, such interventions on digital images can damage the color accuracy and image detail, especially where the gamut is reduced. Professional digital devices and software tools allow for 48 bpp (bits per pixel) images to be manipulated (16 bits per channel), to minimize any such damage.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} {{who would later}} become the Yellow Kid first {{appeared on the scene}} in a minor supporting role in cartoon panel published in Truth magazine in 1894 and 1895. The four different black-and-white single panel cartoons were deemed popular, and one of them, Fourth Ward Brownies, was reprinted on 17 February 1895 in Joseph Pulitzer's New York World, where Outcault worked as a technical drawing artist. The World published another, newer Hogan's Alley cartoon less than a month later, and this was followed by the strip's first <b>color</b> <b>printing</b> on 5 May 1895. Hogan's Alley gradually became a full-page Sunday color cartoon with the Yellow Kid (who was also appearing several times a week) as its lead character.|$|E

25|$|The XPS Print Path {{introduced}} in Windows Vista supports high quality 16-bit <b>color</b> <b>printing.</b> The XPS print path uses XML Paper Specification (XPS) as the print spooler file format, {{that serves as}} the page description language (PDL) for printers. The XPS spooler format is the intended replacement for the Enhanced Metafile (EMF) format which is the print spooler format in the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) print path. XPS is an XML-based (more specifically XAML-based) color-managed device and resolution independent vector-based paged document format which encapsulates an exact representation of the actual printed output. XPS documents are packed in a ZIP container along with text, fonts, raster images, 2D vector graphics and DRM information. For printers supporting XPS, this eliminates an intermediate conversion to a printer-specific language, increasing the reliability and fidelity of the printed output. Microsoft claims that major printer vendors are planning to release printers with built-in XPS support and that this will provide better fidelity to the original document.|$|E
25|$|In 1993 Indigo {{launched}} the E-Print 1000 at IPEX trade show. The E-Print 1000 eliminated the expense and labor of the plate-printing setup process, printing {{directly from a}} computer file, and enabled inexpensive short-run <b>color</b> <b>printing.</b> Images not only could be readily changed, they could be changed from page to page, requiring neither additional setup or pauses in the print run. Instead of printing to metal plates, the E-Print created a latent image on the Photo Imaging Plate or PIP {{through the use of}} an electrostatic charge. This charged area would then attract the charged ElectroInk, which would in turn be transferred to the ITM or blanket, and then again transfer from the blanket to the paper or other substrate. Because 100% of the ink transfers from PIP to blanket to substrate, a different image and color could be printed with each rotation of the press. At the same time, Indigo's ElectroInk-based color inks offered print quality rivaling that of traditional printing processes. Almost 20 years later, and despite the numerous technological improvements, Indigo presses are still based on this core technology.|$|E

500|$|Peck's {{career in}} {{illustration}} {{began in the}} early 1900s with her work for publisher George W. Jacobs in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This was a period when technological innovations in halftone and <b>color</b> <b>printing</b> engendered the [...] "Golden Age of Illustration". [...] In addition to illustrations, Peck created decorations and lettering designs for books. [...] Notable works from this period include illustrations for Sara Hawks Sterling's Shakespeare's Sweetheart (1905) and A Lady of King Arthur's Court (1907), and Josephine Daskam Bacon's In the Border Country (1909). [...] Peck eventually illustrated at least four additional books by Bacon.|$|E
500|$|In 1876 Laurance P. Roberts {{wrote in}} his Dictionary of Japanese Artists that Kunichika {{produced}} prints of actors and other subjects in the late Kunisada tradition, reflecting the declining taste of the Japanese and the deterioration of <b>color</b> <b>printing.</b> Roberts described him as, [...] "A minor artist, but represents {{the last of the}} great ukiyo-e tradition." [...] The cited biography reflects the author's preference for classical ukiyo-e. Richard A.

[...] On the HSV color wheel, also known as the , [...] the complement of green is magenta; that is, a color corresponding to an equal mixture of red and blue light (one of the purples). On a traditional color wheel, based on subtractive color, the complementary color to green is considered to be red.|$|E
500|$|McCay got [...] "an {{idea from}} the Rarebit Fiend {{to please the}} little folk", and in October 1905 the full-page Sunday strip Little Nemo in Slumberland debuted in the Herald.

[...] Nemo's appearance was based on McCay's son Robert.

[...] The Herald was considered to have the highest quality <b>color</b> <b>printing</b> of any newspaper at the time; its printing staff used the Ben Day process for color, and McCay annotated the Nemo pages with precise color schemes for the printers.|$|E
