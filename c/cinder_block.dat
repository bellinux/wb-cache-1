On the completion of the church, the St. Joseph Bell was moved and was set into a tower in the church and equipped with a stationary swinging bell-rocker system. Major changes were done to the interior of the Annunciation Mission in 1964, by the friar in charge, Ivo Zirkelbach. Altars were removed, as were the partitions which created the sacristy and sanctuary boundaries. Zirkelbach also tore down the open garage which sat behind the Friary.|$|E
25|$|The {{most intense}} and longest lived tornado of the {{outbreak}} was a massive, rain-wrapped wedge tornado {{that began in}} southern Dougherty County, Georgia during the late afternoon hours of January 22. The tornado touched down at 3:15p.m. EST (20:15UTC) north of Newton. The first evidence of damage was {{at the intersection of}} Tarvis Road and Tarvis Lane, where the trunks of softwood trees were snapped (consistent with an EF1 tornado). From there, the tornado moved northeast at an average of 59mph (95km/h), causing EF2-level tree damage adjacent to Newton Road. Hundreds of large trees were snapped, twisted, and denuded in this area. Two homes sustained minor damage to their siding, gutters, and roofs. EF2 damage continued as the tornado entered Radium Springs, where several houses lost significant portions of their roofs and sustained damage to their porches. Many trees were snapped and uprooted, a poorly-constructed home on stilts was mostly collapsed, and a second house was shifted completely off its foundation and was severely damaged. A large retail building along the Liberty Expressway had <b>cinder</b> <b>block</b> exterior walls blown out, and wooden power poles were snapped.|$|E
25|$|By 3:26p.m. EST (20:26UTC), {{the large}} and {{destructive}} tornado continued through southeastern portions of Albany, prompting a Tornado Emergency for Dougherty County. It re-attained EF3 as it caused significant damage to multiple structures in Albany. A well-constructed cement block church with hurricane straps and rebar reinforcement, {{as well as a}} well-constructed frame home, both had their exterior walls collapsed; damage at these locations was consistent with winds of approximately 150mph (240km/h), marking the tornado's peak strength. EF2 damage was inflicted to a small residence farther northeast, where large sections of the roof was ripped off. Near the intersection of N County Line Road and Harris Road, the wedge tornado once again regained EF3 intensity as it moved through several mobile home parks, destroying numerous manufactured houses; associated debris was tossed approximately 35yd (32m) downwind, and four fatalities were observed. A well-anchored triple-wide mobile home was completely swept away in this area, and a <b>cinder</b> <b>block</b> business was almost entirely flattened. A small church was leveled as well. In Worth County, north of Jewell Crowe Road, several homes sustained significant damage and many large trees were twisted and snapped. A large, well-built brick home sustained low-end EF3 damage in damage in this area as it had much of its roof ripped off and sustained some failure of exterior walls.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOne of the {{greatest}} challenges in the construction sector throughout the world is the development of appropriate building materials that can reduce energy consumption. In this work, an investigation on the thermophysical properties of three wet composite building materials was carried out: the black pouzzolan, the red pouzzolan and sand <b>cinder</b> <b>blocks.</b> Experimental measurements were carried out on these three materials each with a water contentranging between 0 and 5 %. Using an asymmetrical hot plate device, a transient method, the thermal effusivity and volumetric heat capacity were estimated experimentally with respect to water content. With the values of the mass specific heat capacity of pouzzolans, sand and cement separately measured by the Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) method, the values of the volumetric heat capacity of these composite materials were evaluated according to their water content calculated from the theoretical developed model. The results obtained are in good agreement with those determined experimentally with the asymmetrical hot plate method (maximum standard deviations 5 %). Results reveal that the thermal conductivity of red pouzzolan <b>cinder</b> <b>blocks</b> (e. g. lambda = 0. 503 W m(- 1) K- 1 at 0 % water content) and of black pouzzolan <b>cinder</b> <b>blocks</b> (e. g. lambda = 0. 549 W m(- 1) K- 1 at 0 % water content) are lower than that of sand <b>cinder</b> <b>blocks</b> (e. g. lambda = 0. 875 W m(- 1) K- 1 at 0 % water content). Results also show that pouzzolans <b>cinder</b> <b>blocks</b> have higher volumetric heat capacity than sand <b>cinder</b> <b>blocks.</b> These results further confirm that blocks based on pouzzolans are better insulator materials than sand blocks (usually uses) and can contribute significantly to the energy saving and thus reduce the GHG emission in the air-conditioning building...|$|R

500|$|After {{entering}} DeKalb County, {{the large}} tornado directly impacted the small community of Fairdale. Approximately 71 homes sustained {{some degree of}} damage, including 13 that were destroyed. Several houses on the northwest side of town sustained damage consistent with an upper-end EF3 tornado, with all walls collapsed. A few houses that were nailed to the foundation—not bolted—were swept clean. A 67-year-old woman and her 69-year-old neighbor were both killed in their homes, and an additional 11 people were injured throughout the town. Continuing northeast across Wheeler Road, one residence had {{a large portion of}} its roof ripped off, a second residence had its exterior walls collapsed, and a two-story 80-year-old well-constructed barn was destroyed. A large garage was destroyed and had its debris deposited well downstream, and significant denuding and debarking of trees was evident. Near the intersection of Irene Road and McNeal Road, a well-built seven-year-old house lost its second story and many exterior walls. A two-story well-built barn with <b>cinder</b> <b>block</b> attachment was totally destroyed, and a nearby two-story rebar-reinforced <b>cinder</b> <b>block</b> silo was ripped apart.
