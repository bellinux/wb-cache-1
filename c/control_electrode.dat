50|$|A typical hot-cathode {{thyratron}} uses {{a heated}} filament cathode, completely contained within a shield assembly with a control grid on one open side, which faces the plate-shaped anode. In the off situation the voltage {{on the control}} grid is negative {{with respect to the}} cathode. When positive voltage is applied to the anode, no current flows. When the <b>control</b> <b>electrode</b> is made less negative, electrons from the cathode can travel to the anode because the positive attraction from the anode prevails over the negative repulsion caused by the slightly negative voltage on the control grid. The electrons will ionize the gas by collisions with the gas in the tube, and an avalanche effect results, causing an arc discharge between cathode and anode. The shield prevents ionized current paths that might form within other parts of the tube. The gas in a thyratron is typically {{at a fraction of the}} pressure of air at sea level; 15 to 30 millibars (1.5 to 3 kPa) is typical. For a cold-cathode thyratron the trigger voltage on the control grid will typically be positive, and a flash-over from control grid to cathode will initiate the arc discharge in the tube.|$|E
50|$|Special purpose, high-energy triggerable {{spark gaps}} {{can be used}} to rapidly switch high {{voltages}} and very high currents for certain pulsed power applications, such as pulsed lasers, railguns, fusion, ultrastrong pulsed magnetic field research, and in the triggering of nuclear bombs. Commercially available devices can be divided into two classes: positive pressure and triggered vacuum gaps. Positive pressure triggered gaps have a limited operating voltage range (for instance, from 1/3 to 2/3 of the self breakdown voltage). Triggered vacuum gaps offer a wide operating voltage range (400 V to 90 kV is achievable). Both classes can switch higher energy levels than any thyristor, thyratron, krytron, or sprytron. Triggered gaps are popular for single-shot and low-repetition-rate applications. One such switch is known as a trigatron. The Ignitron and Crossatron could be considered triggered gaps. The latter is unique in that it can be turned back off by the <b>control</b> <b>electrode</b> after conduction begins. The xenon flash tube is another common triggered gap. Various schemes have also been devised to trigger open air gaps on command. A set of spark gaps are a key element of a Marx generator, used to generate high-voltage impulses; the spark gaps allow a chain of capacitors to be slowly charged in parallel and then rapidly discharged in series.|$|E
