40|$|At {{the begining}} of the {{bachelor}} thesis is a theoretical part {{that deals with}} the basic principle of machining. <b>Cutter</b> <b>arbor</b> 40 × 27 ČSN 24 1440 is assessed from technological point of view. Yearly production of the arbor is 17 000 pieces. The main theme is a technological evaluation of the production process from two type sof semi finished product, circular bar hot rolled and forging both made of 14 220. 0. For the technological process are chosen machina and tools. Production instruction is elaborated for rough turning operation and the reset is machining time. In the conclusion is chosen semi finished forging according to the technological and economical evaluation of the production process...|$|E
