40|$|Red clover is {{the most}} {{important}} forage legume in the Czech Republic. It is an unassuming species to <b>climatic</b> <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> <b>condition,</b> is suitable for mixtures with grasses and it is above other grassland species in forage quality. The most serious problem of red clover in grasslands is its lack of persistency (2 – 4 years). Considering of red clover growing area on arable land decrease and area of permanent grasslands increases, becomes persistency of varieties important attribute. The persistency of all Czech varieties was evaluated on the basis of dominance proportion investigation after 3 winters. Assessed varieties were established in mixture with grasses (60 : 40 %). Significantly most persistent varieties were Amos 4 n (24. 5 %), Dolina 4 n (20. 25 %) and Radegast 4 n (19. 25 %). Varieties of Alsike clover were not significantly different from varieties of red clover...|$|E
40|$|Tropical {{climate is}} characterised by high ambient {{temperatures}} and solar radiation, {{a combination of}} these factors causes thermal discomfort in buildings. The common approach to maintaining comfortable thermal environment in buildings in such climates is using mechanical air-conditioning systems. High energy demand is needed to operate and maintain these systems continuously over long periods of time. With the rapid increase in population and economic growth of countries in the tropical regions, it is becoming inevitable that passive and low energy strategies must be used as suitable alternatives. Earth-air heat exchanger (EAHX) is a subterranean ventilation system that explores soil temperature below the surface to pre-cool or pre-heat ventilation air. Performance of EAHX varies with <b>climatic</b> <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> <b>condition</b> of the area. Climatic and soil parameters affecting the thermal performance of EAHX has been determined for Tropical climate of Nigeria. Thermal simulations have been carried out using Transient System Simulation Environment (TRNSYS) to evaluate the cooling energy gain and the reduction of ambient temperature extremes. The results show that the system can be used to improve comfort conditions and reduce building cooling loads...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The use of {{biodiesel}} {{is rapidly}} expanding around the world, making it imperative {{to fully understand}} the impacts of biodiesel on the diesel engine combustion process and pollutant formation. Biodiesel is known as “the mono alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived from renewable lipid feedstock, such as vegetable oils or animal fats, for use in compression ignition (diesel) engines. ” Biodiesel was made by transesterification from linseed oil. In aspect of Bangladesh linseed {{can play an important}} role in the production of alternative diesel fuel. The <b>climatic</b> <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> <b>condition</b> of our country is convenient for the production of linseed (Linum Usitatissimum) crop. In the first phase of this work optimization of different parameters for biodiesel production were investigated. In the second phase the performance study of a diesel engine with diesel biodiesel blends were carried out. The results showed that with the variation of catalyst, methanol and reaction time; variation of biodiesel production was realized. About 88 % biodiesel production was experienced with 20 % methanol, 0. 5 % NaOH catalyst and at 550 C. The results also showed that when compared with neat diesel fuel, biodiesel gives almost similar thermal efficiency, lower carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM) while slightly higher nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission was experienced...|$|E

40|$|The Neotropical {{region to}} which Brazil belongs, {{has a great}} and rich {{diversity}} of natives bees, up {{to a total of}} 3. 000 species including the allochtone genus Apis that by natural crossing among European and African races produced a hybrid called Africanized honeybee. In this way, beekeeping enjoys a spectacular moment with good production mainly of honey and propolis from Apis mellifera, causing Brazil to be recognized around the world as a country with great potential. Brazilian bee losses nevertheless remain a question, compared with countries of the northern hemisphere where several reports show that the vanishing of honeybees is associated with diseases caused by Varroa, Nosema, virus or pesticides. We can suggest different issues in the Brazilian situation that are directly influencing the honeybee population. Given the extension of the territory and rich flora, all possible food resources and nest sites for the good development of bees may be considered present. However, we verified that annual bee losses in the Southeast can reach 20 - 30 %, mainly due the genetic mechanisms of swarming (nest abandon). Many times the major factor leading to nest abandon is lack of food, often taken mistakenly by the untrained beekeeper as death of the hive caused by diseases or pesticides. Although in Brazil diseases do not represent an important problem for Africanized honeybees, some cases of presence of Nosema ceranae and Varroa destructor led the specialists to precaution and monitoring the colonies. In spite of this, the Brazilian beekeeping is managed without use of any acaricide or antibiotic, producing contaminant-free products. As to pesticides, Brazil has a particular <b>climatic</b> <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> <b>condition</b> that might differently affect the risk of exposure of bees to xenobiotics. For example, comparing the dynamics of carbamate pesticides in soil between Brazil and Europe, it was found that in our condition ten-fold more time is needed to obtain the metabolites sulfone and sulfoxide, both more soluble and toxic than it precursor. Comparing the pesticides consumption, currently Brazil has become the world leader followed by USA, with a total spending of 44. 9 % herbicide, 28. 5 % insecticide and 22. 1 % fungicide. Even with this consumption Brazil still belongs to the group that uses a relatively small amount of active ingredient per hectare, less than Japan and France. However cultures like tomato, potato, citrus, cotton and coffee that are often visited by bees during bloom, are also those where the use of pesticides is needed for the pest control. Thus, little is known yet about pesticide losses of the Brazilian bees! What are real effects of pesticides, toxic plants, diseases, genetic improvement, beekeeping management, starvation or interactions among these? Therefore, our local group on ecotoxicological assessment is trying to increase the knowledge on the pesticides hazard to bees (Apis and non-Apis) in order to protect these...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the dynamics of leaf and flower development in these Magnolia species under the <b>climatic</b> <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> <b>conditions</b> of Lublin as well as to evaluate the size of their leaves and long shoots. The present study included the following species: M. acuminata L., M. kobus DC, M. liliiflora Desr., M. salicifolia Siebold et Zuch, M. x soulangiana Soul. - -Bod., and M. tripetala L. The magnolia trees were planted in 1968 - 1989 on grey-brown podzolic soil derived from loess. The study area is affected by the continental climate which is characterized by large annual amplitude of temperatures, long summers as well as long and cold winters. The long-term average annual air temperature for this region is 8. 1 o C, while the long-term average annual rainfall reaches 541. 6 mm.
