25|$|An augercast pile, often {{known as}} a <b>continuous</b> <b>flight</b> {{augering}} (CFA) pile, is formed by drilling into {{the ground with a}} hollow stemmed <b>continuous</b> <b>flight</b> auger to the required depth or degree of resistance. No casing is required. A cement grout mix is then pumped down the stem of the auger. While the cement grout is pumped, the auger is slowly withdrawn, conveying the soil upward along the flights. A shaft of fluid cement grout is formed to ground level. Reinforcement can be installed. Recent innovations in addition to stringent quality control allows reinforcing cages to be placed up to the full length of a pile when required. A typical reinforcing cage will consist of 4 to 8 bars from #5 to #8 bars typically 1/3 the length of the pile with longitudinal circular ties spaced {{along the length of the}} cage. Where tension loads are present it is typical to see a single full length bar placed at the center of each pile.|$|E

2500|$|Monosaccharides [...] are {{the major}} source of fuel for metabolism, being used both as an energy source (glucose being the most {{important}} in nature) and in biosynthesis. When monosaccharides are not immediately needed by many cells they are often converted to more space-efficient forms, often polysaccharides. In many animals, including humans, this storage form is glycogen, especially in liver and muscle cells. In plants, starch is used for the same purpose. The most abundant carbohydrate, cellulose, is a structural component of the cell wall of plants and many forms of algae. Ribose is a component of RNA. Deoxyribose is a component of DNA. Lyxose is a component of lyxoflavin found in the human heart. Ribulose and xylulose occur in the pentose phosphate pathway. Galactose, a component of milk sugar lactose, is found in galactolipids in plant cell membranes and in glycoproteins in many tissues. Mannose occurs in human metabolism, especially in the glycosylation of certain proteins. Fructose, or fruit sugar, is found in many plants and in humans, it is metabolized in the liver, absorbed directly into the intestines during digestion, and found in semen. Trehalose, a major sugar of insects, is rapidly hydrolyzed into two glucose molecules to support <b>continuous</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E

This allowed for a better job at the dewatering and a consistent cake material being released.|$|E

40|$|AUTOMATIC {{dependent}} surveillance–broadcast (ADS-B) [1, 2] {{is widely}} implemented in modern commercial aircraft and will become mandatory equipment in 2020. Flight state {{information such as}} position, velocity, and vertical rate are broadcast by {{tens of thousands of}} aircraft around the world constantly using onboard ADS-B transponders. These data are identified by a 24 -bit International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) address, are unencrypted, and can be received and decoded with simple ground station set-ups. This large amount of open data brings a huge potential for ATM research. Most studies that rely on aircraft flight data (historical or real-time) require knowledge on the flight phase of each aircraft at a given time [3 – 7]. However, when dealing with large datasets such as from ADS-B, which can contain many tens of thousands of flights, exceptions to deterministic definitions of flight phases are inevitable, due to large variances in climb rate, altitude, velocity, or a combination of these. In this case, instead of using deterministic logic to process and extract flight data based on flight conventions, robust and versatile identification algorithms are required. In this paper, a twofold method is proposed and tested: 1) a machine learning clustering step that can handle large amounts of scattered ADS-B data to extract <b>continuous</b> <b>flights,</b> and 2) a flight phase identification step that can segment flight data of any type of aircraft and trajectory by different flight phases.
