40|$|Under the <b>conditional</b> <b>fee</b> arrangement, {{a lawyer}} {{receives}} an upscale premium if a case is won. In this article, we develop an asymmetric information game of settlement and litigation {{in order to}} compare hourly and <b>conditional</b> <b>fees</b> {{with regard to their}} effects on the number of frivolous suits being filed, the settlement rate of cases, and the total costs of litigation. The main result shows that a <b>conditional</b> <b>fee</b> schedule improves the efficiency of the litigation process under the English fee-shifting rule by undermining frivolous plaintiffs' incentives to file suit and then reducing total expenditures. It hence provides an additional theoretical foundation for the recent switchover from hourly <b>fees</b> to <b>conditional</b> <b>fees</b> in the United Kingdom. ...|$|R

40|$|Prior to the {{subprime}} crisis, mortgage brokers charged higher percentage fees for loans {{that turned out}} to be riskier ex post, even when conditioning on other risk characteristics. High <b>conditional</b> <b>fees</b> reveal borrower attributes that are associated with high borrower risk, such as suboptimal shopping behavior, high valuation for the loan or high borrower-specific broker costs. Borrowers who pay high <b>conditional</b> <b>fees</b> are inherently more risky, not just because they pay high fees. We find a stronger association between <b>conditional</b> <b>fees</b> and delinquency risk when lenders have fewer incentives to screen borrowers, for purchase rather than refinance loans, and for loans originated by brokers who have less frequent interactions with the lender. Our findings shed light on the proposed QRM exemption criteria for risk retention requirements for residential mortgage securitizations. ...|$|R
5000|$|If {{previous}} grantors of a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> estate do {{not create}} any conditions for subsequent grantees, then {{the title is}} called <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> absolute. A <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> absolute is the highest estate permitted by law and it gives the holder full possessory rights and obligations {{now and in the}} future. Other <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> estates in real property include <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> defeasible (or <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> determinable) estates. A defeasible estate is created when a grantor places a condition on a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> estate (in the deed). When a specified event happens, the estate may become void or subject to annulment. There are two types of defeasible estates: <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> determinable and the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> subject to a condition subsequent. If the grantor uses durational language in the condition such as [...] "to A. as long as the land is used for a park", then upon the happening of the specified event (in this case if the land is used for anything other than a park), the estate will automatically terminate and revert to the grantor or the grantor's estate; this is called a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> determinable. If the grantor uses language such as [...] "but if alcohol is served", then the grantor or the heirs have a right of entry if the condition occurs, but the estate does not automatically revert to the grantor; this is a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> subject to a condition subsequent. In most jurisdictions in the United States these concepts have been modified by statute. <b>Fee</b> <b>simple</b> determinable was generally preferred by courts in the common law of the early United States. Recently, that trend has reversed, and most courts in the United States will find a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> subject to condition subsequent in situations where the conveying document's language is unclear.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> determinable is {{an estate}} that will end {{automatically}} when the stated event or condition occurs. The interest will {{revert to the}} grantor or the heirs of the grantor. Normally, a possibility of reverter follows a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> determinable. However a possibility of reverter does not follow a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> determinable subject to an executory interest. Durational language such as [...] "to A {{as long as the}} property is used for a park" [...] creates a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> determinable and a possibility of reverter.|$|R
40|$|Prominent {{economically}} oriented legal academics {{are currently}} {{arguing that the}} <b>fee</b> <b>simple,</b> the dominant form of private landownership in the United States, is an inefficient way for society to allocate land. They maintain that the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> blocks transfers of land to higher value uses because it provides property owners with a perpetual monopoly. The critics propose that landownership be reformulated to enable private actors to forcibly purchase land from other private owners, {{similar to the way}} that governments can expropriate land for public uses using eminent domain. While recognizing the significance of the critique, this Article takes issue with it and defends the <b>fee</b> <b>simple.</b> The Article makes two main points in defense of the <b>fee</b> <b>simple.</b> First, addressing the critique on its own economic terms, the Article argues that the critics have not established that there is a robust economic argument for dispensing with the <b>fee</b> <b>simple.</b> The critique that the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> leads to the misallocation of land rests on three empirical premises for which the critics have yet to provide much evidence. The critique also downplays or overlooks important economic benefits of the <b>fee</b> <b>simple.</b> Second, departing from the economic discourse of the critics, the Article argues that the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> is valuable because it gives landowners a perpetual right to choose, free from the dictates of others, whether to transfer their land. Thus the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> expands the choices of landowners and promotes their independence and autonomy. Eliminating the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> would leave landowners vulnerable to the whims of others, and less free and autonomous. Landownership is not only about efficiency, but also about individual freedom...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> {{subject to}} a {{condition}} subsequent is created when {{the words of a}} grant support the conclusion that the grantor intends to convey a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> absolute but has attached a condition to the grant so that if a specified future event happens the grantor will get its <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> absolute back, provided that the grantor exercises his right of entry (or power of termination). Thus, a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> subject to condition subsequent does not end automatically upon the happening of the condition. The future interest is called a [...] "right of reentry" [...] or [...] "right of entry," [...] and the property only reverts to the original grantor if he exercises this right.|$|R
