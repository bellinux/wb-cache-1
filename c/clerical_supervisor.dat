2500|$|According to the investigations, Oswald hid {{and covered}} the rifle with boxes after the attack and descended through the rear stairwell. About 90 seconds after the shots rang out, Oswald {{encountered}} police officer Marrion L. Baker, who had his gun drawn, [...] in the second-floor lunchroom. The patrolman was accompanied by Oswald's supervisor, Roy Truly. Baker let Oswald pass after Truly identified him as an employee. According to Baker, Oswald {{did not appear to}} be [...] "nervous" [...] or [...] "out of breath." [...] Truly said that Oswald look [...] "startled" [...] when Baker pointed his gun directly at him. Mrs. Robert Reid—a <b>clerical</b> <b>supervisor</b> at the depository who returned to her office within two minutes after the shooting—said that she saw Oswald [...] "was very calm" [...] on the second floor with a coke in his hands. As they walked past each other, Mrs. Reid said to Oswald, [...] "The President has been shot" [...] to which he mumbled something in response, but Reid did not understand him. Oswald was believed to have left the depository through the front entrance just before police sealed it off. Truly later pointed out to officers that Oswald was the only employee that he was certain was missing.|$|E
50|$|The Department is {{currently}} authorized 40 officers. In October, 2010 Chief Rudy {{retired from the}} agency. Captain Henry G. Trabert was appointed Chief, the first officer to rise through the ranks to that position since Arthur Elliott in the 1970s. The Aberdeen Police Department is a full service police agency. It consists of a Patrol Division staffed by 24 patrolmen and overseen by a lieutenant. The Criminal Investigation Division has three full-time investigators and a crime scene technician; three additional detectives (including a K-9) are assigned to the Special Operations Unit and are responsible for street level narcotics and vice investigations. A fourth detective is assigned full-time to the Harford County Task Force, a county wide multi-jurisdictional unit investigating mid- and upper level drug trafficking organizations. CID is supervised by a lieutenant. The Administrative lieutenant is responsible for procurement, quartermaster inventory, fleet maintenance, records management, police communications and numerous other related activities. He supervises and is assisted by an administrative sergeant, who oversees two School Resource officers and crossing guards and a civilian <b>clerical</b> <b>supervisor.</b> The Department also deploys a Special Weapons and Tactics Team, an Honor Guard and a Vehicle Accident Reconstruction Team. Under the Office of the Chief is a Deputy Chief, {{who is responsible for}} the day-today operations of the Department and a civilian CALEA manager. And to think, it all started with a Town Bailiff.|$|E
30|$|In 2005, an {{opportunity}} {{to create a new}} model for the conduct of clinical research within which all staff and new patients could participate to improve future clinical care, was identified by a group of researchers at VIC and endorsed by the centre’s leadership. PREDICT was initially funded by a start-up grant from a government funded foundation which was matched by funding from a philanthropic foundation. The project was named ‘Personal Response Determinants In Cancer Therapy’ project (PREDICT) to convey a focus on enabling research focusing on aspects such as the tumour and its relation to treatment outcomes to encompass the patient-centered side of the cancer problem (i.e. patient factors such as biological, psychosocial and societal), by emphasizing the patient’s key role through participation, as part of a solution. The PREDICT model would evolve to have two components: a “permission to contact” mechanism, asking participants for permission to be contacted in the future for research; and a biobank component, collecting and storing blood samples of participants for future research. The research team, now re-named the PREDICT Steering Committee requested expressions of interest to all staff disciplines to join the PREDICT Design Team. The start-up grant provided backfill funding to the design team during the design phase. Ten staff members were selected to be members of the Design Team based on degree of experience working with patients, diversity of discipline or other qualities such as knowledge, ability and leadership that would facilitate an efficient team. Members of this team included a Change Management Consultant (who had been enrolled at the outset to assist with the organizational transformation), a Clinical Research Coordinator, a Research Phlebotomist, an Administrative Assistant, a <b>Clerical</b> <b>Supervisor,</b> a New Patient Clerk, a Nursing Supervisor, a Clerk, a Volunteer, a Registered Nurse and a Radiation Therapist. This team met for a two day workshop {{at the beginning of the}} project where they listened to overall goals envisaged by the steering committee, and then independently discussed the scope of design team, deliverables, and timelines as well as allocated responsibilities. The design team met weekly to bi-weekly as required from March to June 2006 and created an outline for the PREDICT process, making decisions about who would be approached, when and how to approach potential participants, consent, obtain a blood sample and re-contact patients after consenting. They sought feedback from colleagues and evaluated the process in the clinical setting by participating in a mock trial run.|$|E
50|$|From the start, the WPWU {{represented}} {{workers in}} both the handmade and factory-production parts of the wallpaper industry; over time, it also recruited <b>clerical</b> staff and <b>supervisors.</b> Membership of was fairly constant, from just under 3,000 in 1927, to 2,000 in the 1930s, peaking at 4,700 in 1975, then falling to 3,820 by 1979.|$|R
40|$|Employment {{success of}} {{disabled}} and non-disabled persons {{is dependent upon}} demonstrating acceptable levels of technical and social skills. Yet rehabilitation counselors and employers have little information about what social behaviors are important for job success. ^ This study 2 ̆ 7 s purpose was to show that diverse employers, representing different jobs and settings, could identify a group of social behaviors necessary for success in all jobs. It was hypothesized that: (1) the majority of identified behaviors would be independently and coincidentally generated by employers {{of each of the}} jobs and settings represented, hence, the name general employability behaviors; (2) the rank-order importance of the behaviors would correspond more closely with similar jobs than with similar settings; and (3) employer and rehabilitation counselor rankings of the behaviors, for the same job, would differ significantly. ^ The Delphi fact-finding methodology required that subjects complete a first questionnaire to generate a list of behaviors and two subsequent questionnaires to obtain rankings of the behaviors 2 ̆ 7 relative importance for each job. Three study groups included two equal groups of custodial and <b>clerical</b> <b>supervisors</b> (n = 18 for each group) representing the services and manufacturing Standard Industrial Classification Divisions (SIDs). Each of the SIDs included three sub-groups representing different employers. The third study group (n = 9) was comprised of rehabilitation counselors who participated only on questionnaire three. ^ The nominal and rank-order data were analyzed using visual scan, median tests, Spearman rank-order correlation, chi square and contingency coefficient analyses. The findings confirmed the existence of a group of general employability behaviors relevant to all jobs and all settings. Results concerning the rank-order importance of the different behaviors were intermixed, and showed no well-defined correspondence within or between jobs or SIDs. Rehabilitation counselor and employer rankings did not differ significantly. ^ Discussion focused on methodological refinements pertaining to the Delphi technique and the relationship of these results to the findings of other pertinent studies. Also discussed was the importance of attending to general employability behaviors in the practice of all aspects of vocational rehabilitation and career planning services. Numerous areas for additional research were suggested. ...|$|R
5000|$|Likewise, a {{desk was}} a [...] "common repository", {{likely to be}} used by many people besides the one {{regularly}} seated behind it. [...] "It is foreseeable that a number of different people working for government, from <b>clerical</b> staff to <b>supervisors</b> to colleagues, will move into an office, that is, enter an office, open a desk for a variety of reasons." [...] When Justice Sandra Day O'Connor challenged him as to whether employees in the private sector would have a reasonable expectation of privacy over their desks, he agreed that they might but reminded her the Fourth Amendment does not apply to private employers.|$|R
50|$|Clerical {{workers are}} perhaps the largest {{occupational}} group in the United States. In 2004, there were 3.1 million general office clerks, 1.5 million office administrative supervisors and 4.1 million secretaries. Clerical occupations often do not require a college degree, though some college education or 1 to 2 years in vocational programs are common qualifications. Familiarity with office equipment and certain software programs is also often required. Employers may provide clerical training. The median salary for clerks is $23,000, while the national median income for workers age 25 or older is $33,000. Median salaries ranged from $22,770 for general office clerks to $34,970 for secretaries and $41,030 for administrative <b>supervisors.</b> <b>Clerical</b> workers are considered working class by American sociologists such as William Thompson, Joseph Hickey or James Henslin as they perform highly routinized tasks with relatively little autonomy. Sociologist Dennis Gilbert, argues that the white and blue collar divide has shifted to a divide between professionals, including some semi-professionals, and routinized white collar workers. White collar office supervisors may be considered lower middle class with some secretaries being located {{in that part of}} the socio-economic strata where the working and middle classes overlap.|$|R
