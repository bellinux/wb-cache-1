60|$|At Radford in Devonshire (10/44.

6000|$|Whether or not {{the peach}} has {{proceeded}} from the almond, it has certainly given rise to nectarines, or smooth peaches, {{as they are called}} by the French. Most of the varieties, both of the peach and nectarine, reproduce themselves truly by seed. Gallesio (10/29. 'Teoria della Riproduzione Vegetale' 1816 page 86.) says he has verified this with respect to eight races of the peach. Mr. Rivers (10/30. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1862 page 1195.) has given some striking instances from his own experience, and it is notorious that good peaches are constantly raised in North America from seed. Many of the American sub-varieties come true or nearly true to their kind, such as the white-blossom, several of the yellow-fruited freestone peaches, the blood clingstone, the heath, and the lemon clingstone. On the other hand, a <b>clingstone</b> <b>peach</b> has been known to give rise to a freestone. (10/31. Mr. Rivers 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1859 page 774.) In England it has been noticed that seedlings inherit from their parents flowers of the same size and colour. Some characters, however, contrary to what might have been expected, often are not inherited; such as the presence and form of the glands on the leaves. (10/32. Downing 'The Fruits of America' 1845 pages 475, 489, 492, 494, 496. See also F. Michaux 'Travels in N. America' English translation page 228. For similar cases in France see Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 2 page 97.) With respect to nectarines, both cling and freestones are known in North America to reproduce themselves by seed. (10/33. Brickell 'Nat. Hist. of N. Carolina' page 102 and Downing 'Fruit Trees' page 505.) In England the new white nectarine was a seedling of the old white, and Mr. Rivers (10/34. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1862 page 1196.) has recorded several similar cases. From this strong tendency to inheritance, which both peach and nectarine trees exhibit,--from certain slight constitutional differences (10/35. The peach and nectarine do not succeed equally well in the some soil: see Lindley 'Horticulture' page 351.) in their nature,--and from the great difference in their fruit both in appearance and flavour, it is not surprising, notwithstanding that the trees differ in no other respects and cannot even be distinguished, as I am informed by Mr. Rivers, whilst young, that they have been ranked by some authors as specifically distinct. Gallesio does not doubt that they are distinct; even Alph. De Candolle does not appear perfectly assured of their specific identity: and an eminent botanist has quite recently (10/36. Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 2 1859 page 97.) maintained that the nectarine [...] "probably constitutes a distinct species." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the first}} part of my PhD {{dissertation}} the problem of split pit, pit cracking and pit fragments in freestone and <b>clingstone</b> <b>peaches</b> was studied. To study the problem of pit fragments in <b>clingstone</b> <b>peaches,</b> the effect of cultivar, fruit size and stage of maturity at harvest on pit fragment formation were studied. The percentage of fruits with pit fragments in large size fruits was significantly larger than in small size fruits, but the stage of fruit maturity did not affect pit fragment formation. In order to reduce the pit fragment formation in <b>clingstone</b> <b>peaches,</b> fruit thinning at different time and density and different time of summer pruning were applied. Light and delayed fruit thinning reduced pit fragment formation, in comparison to heavy and early fruit thinning. An attempt to reduce the split pit and pit cracking formation, fruit thinning at different time and density and different time of summer pruning were applied. Delayed fruit thinning resulted in significantly reduced percentage of fruits with pit cracking. Heavy and/or early fruit thinning resulted in reduced duration of pit hardening and reduced lignin content in peach pits which consists in reduced strong structure of lignin polymers and the whole endocarp. In the second part of my PhD dissertation the effect of ethylene biosynthesis and action inhibitors at postharvest physiology and antioxidant properties of peach fruits was studied. The inhibitor of ethylene action 1 -MCP as gas or water soluble form and the inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis AVG were applied after harvest on fruits of several cultivars. Both forms of 1 -MCP delayed fruit softening {{to a greater extent than}} AVG and control fruits during cold storage and 2 - 3 days at 20 οC. Application of AVG resulted in significantly decreased ethylene production, while there were no differences between 1 -MCP treated and control fruits.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Clingstone</b> <b>peaches</b> {{contain a}} wide array of complex {{secondary}} plant metabolites and polyphenolics, and increasing evidence indicates that many of these components are important in human health. Oligomeric flavan- 3 -ol metabolites (procyanidins) are particularly interesting owing to their potent antioxidant activity and protective cardiovascular effects. To date, little information is available on how postharvest and processing conditions impact levels of phenolics and procyanidins in fruit. This research addresses the impact of lye peeling, freezing, storage temperature (4 and 30 °C) and three different time–temperature sterilisation combinations on levels of total phenolics (TPs) in Ross <b>clingstone</b> <b>peaches.</b> Additionally, we describe the profile of procyanidin oligomers (monomers through heptamers) in <b>clingstone</b> and freestone <b>peaches</b> and demonstrate a dramatic decrease in procyanidins in thermally processed peaches. TP levels ranged between 316 and 397 mg kg 1 in peeled peaches and between 376 and 609 mg kg 1 in unpeeled peaches. Cold storage at 4 °C for 14 days or freezing and storing at 12 °C for 3 months produced no loss in TPs. Peaches stored at 30 °C for 24 h resulted in a 1. 7 -fold increase in TPs. Studies of TPs in peaches processed at temperatures of 213 °F for 40 min, 220 °F for 10 min and 230 °F for 2. 4 min indicate that processing above 213 °F decreases levels of both TPs (up to 21 %) and procyanidins (up to 100 %). Processing at 213 °F for 40 min produced no significant loss in TPs. Furthermore, studies reveal that a 30 – 43 % loss in phenolic levels occurs during the first 3 months in storage after canning. It is clear that both storage and thermal processing conditions profoundly impact the levels of polyphenolics in peaches. More interestingly, these studies indicate that peaches are a rich source of procyanidins, having profiles similar to those found in cocoa, apples, wine and tea...|$|R

Pasteurization induced significant reductions in the concentration of protocatechuic acid (from 10. 2 to 5. 8 mg/g fw), zexanthin and b-cryptoxanthin. Significant reduction in antioxidant activity, expressed as ascorbic acid equivalents, from 0. 52 to 0. 25 mg/g fw, was observed during storage of pasteurized peach for 90 days.

40|$|Syllepsis is the {{predominant}} mode of branching in young peach and nectarine trees [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch]. Cultivars differ considerably in expression of apical control of sylleptic shoots. This has practical implications regarding tree training. Four cultivars {{were selected for}} increasing apical control by the central shoot axis, viz., 'Zaigina', 'Mayglo', 'Fiesta Red' (all nectarines), and 'Oom Sarel' (<b>clingstone</b> <b>peach),</b> respectively. Young, actively growing shoots were harvested when ≃ 300 mm in length, {{at a time when}} development of sylleptic shoots (laterals) had begun. Length, crotch angle, and position (as distance from the apex) of the laterals were recorded. When length of the laterals was plotted against their position, two zones were observed. The gradient of length vs. position was shallower in the distal than in the proximal zone. Autonomy in lateral shoots can be described as their ability to grow independently of apical control by the apex of the branch. Autonomy of laterals near the branch apex increased with their length. In 'Zaigina' this was established via a more distal start of the second zone, and in 'Mayglo' via an increased gradient in the second zone. The early loss or maintenance of apical control regulates architecture in sylleptically branched peach and nectarine shoots. Crotch angle widening of laterals appears to be largely dependent on position, but in some cultivars, such as 'Mayglo', other factors are also involved. The data provide evidence of correlative phenomena between actively growing shoots. Articl...|$|E

See also Carriere 'Description et Class. des Varietes de Pechers.') enumerated one hundred and sixty-four varieties of the peach and nectarine grown in England. I have already indicated the chief points of difference between the several varieties. Nectarines, even when produced from distinct kinds of peaches, always possess their own peculiar flavour, and are smooth and small. <b>Clingstone</b> and freestone <b>peaches,</b> which differ in the ripe flesh either firmly adhering to the stone, or easily separating from it, also differ in the character of the stone itself; that of the freestones or melters being more deeply fissured, with the sides of the fissures smoother than in clingstones. In the various kinds the flowers differ not only in size, but in the larger flowers the petals are differently shaped, more imbricated, generally red in the centre and pale towards the margin: whereas in the smaller flowers the margin of the petal is usually more darkly coloured. One variety has nearly white flowers. The leaves are more or less serrated, and are either destitute of glands, or have globose or reniform glands (10/58. Loudon's 'Encyclop. of Gardening' page 907.) and some few peaches, such as the Brugnen, bear on the same tree both globular and kidney-shaped glands. (10/59. M. Carriere in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1865 page 1154.) According to Robertson (10/60. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 3 page 332. See also 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1865 page 271 to same effect. Also 'Journal of Horticulture' September 26, 1865 page 254.) the trees with glandular leaves are liable to blister, but not in any great degree to mildew; whilst the non-glandular trees are more subject to curl, to mildew, and to the attacks of aphides. The varieties differ in the period of their maturity, in the fruit keeping well, and in hardiness,--the latter circumstance being especially attended to in the United States. Certain varieties, such as the Bellegarde, stand forcing in hot-houses better than other varieties. The flat-peach of China is the most remarkable of all the varieties; it is so much depressed towards the summit, that the stone is here covered only by roughened skin and not by a fleshy layer. (10/61. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 4 page 512.) Another Chinese variety, called the Honey-peach, is remarkable from the fruit terminating in a long sharp point; its leaves are glandless and widely dentate. (10/62. 'Journal of Horticulture' September 8, 1853 page 188.) The Emperor of Russia peach is a third singular variety, having deeply double-serrated leaves; the fruit is deeply cleft with one-half projecting considerably beyond the other: it originated in America, and its seedlings inherit similar leaves.
