5|$|The Copa Libertadores {{stayed on}} Brazilian soil for the {{remainder}} of the 1990s as <b>Cruzeiro,</b> Vasco da Gama and Palmeiras took the spoils. The cup of 1997 pitted <b>Cruzeiro</b> against Peruvian club Sporting Cristal. The key breakthrough came in the second leg of the final when <b>Cruzeiro</b> broke the deadlock with just under 15 minutes left in a match attended by over 106,000 spectators in the Mineirão. Vasco da Gama defeated Barcelona SC with ease to record their first title in 1998. The decade ended on a high note when Palmeiras and Deportivo Cali, both runners-up in the competition before, vied to become winners for the first time in 1999. The final was a dramatic back-and-forth match that went into penalties. Luiz Felipe Scolari managed to lead yet another club to victory as the Verdão won 4–3 in São Paulo.|$|E
5|$|The local {{rivalry between}} Atlético and <b>Cruzeiro,</b> {{known as the}} Clássico Mineiro ("Mineiro Derby"), exists since Cruzeiro's {{foundation}} (as Sociedade Esportiva Palestra Itália) in 1921. It strengthened in the 1940s, and became the biggest derby in Minas Gerais in the 1960s. Atlético dominated the rivalry from its early days until the 1950s, but <b>Cruzeiro</b> rose in the 1960s {{to be a strong}} challenger, and the 1970s had divided honours. The 1980s were dominated by Atlético, while the 1990s and 2000s were favourable to <b>Cruzeiro.</b> The 2010s have the rivals competing at an even level. The clubs dissent over the number of matches and head-to-head record of the Clássico Mineiro, but both team's statistics show Atlético with most wins in the encounter. The only national final between the two clubs happened in the 2014 Copa do Brasil, when Atlético triumphed in a final match played at the Mineirão. The Clássicos most extreme result was a 9–2 win by Atlético, in the 1927 Campeonato Mineiro.|$|E
5|$|Success {{continued}} in the 1940s, with a squad that included Carlyle, Lucas Miranda, Nívio and goalkeeper Kafunga. The club was dominant in the state as it won the league in 1941, 1942, 1946, 1947 and 1949. Although América had been Atlético's long-standing adversary, a new rivalry started to develop with <b>Cruzeiro</b> in the 1940s, as it became Galo's main challenger during this period.|$|E
5000|$|In 1942, coins were {{introduced}} in denominations of 10, 20 and 50 centavos, and 1, 2 and 5 <b>cruzeiros.</b> The centavos were initially struck in cupro-nickel, switching to aluminium-bronze in 1943, whilst the <b>cruzeiros</b> were struck in aluminium-bronze from the start. The 5 <b>cruzeiros</b> was not struck after 1943. Aluminium replaced aluminium-bronze in 1956 and 1957 in all the coins. Coinage stopped production in 1961, restarting in 1965 with aluminium 10 and 20 <b>cruzeiros,</b> and cupro-nickel 50 <b>cruzeiros.</b> In 1964, the [...] "centavo" [...] coins were withdrawn, and the other coins were withdrawn between 1967 and 1968.|$|R
50|$|When Nonoca was {{promoted}} to <b>Cruzeiro's</b> First Team, he was convinced by his staff and family to use the name Lucas Ventura, but decided to change back to his nickname in June 2017, defending he was always known as Nonoca by <b>Cruzeiro's</b> colleagues and staff, {{since he was a}} kid growing up on the junior team. Nonoca participated well in several games in 2017, getting regular call-ups and being regularly used as a sub for <b>Cruzeiro's</b> defensive midfielders.|$|R
50|$|URVs were {{quoted in}} <b>cruzeiros</b> reais and its {{intrinsic}} value was pegged to three price indices {{and had a}} fixed parity of 1-to-1 to the U.S. dollar. The exchange rate of URVs to <b>cruzeiros</b> reais was recalculated and published daily by the government.|$|R
5|$|The {{reign of}} Los Diablos Rojos finally ended in 1976 {{when they were}} {{defeated}} by fellow Argentine club River Plate {{in the second phase}} in a dramatic playoff for a place in the finals. However, in the finals River Plate themselves would be beaten by <b>Cruzeiro</b> of Brazil, which was the first victory by a Brazilian club in 13 years.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{managed to}} emulate their {{northern}} neighbors with the 1995 edition being an all-Argentinian affair. Independiente, led by Jorge Burruchaga, managed to consecrate themselves winners after defeating Carlos Bianchi's legendary Vélez Sársfield 1–0 in Tokyo. Independiente {{participated in a}} second, consecutive final only to lose the title to Grêmio after being defeated 4–1. The 1997 edition was won by a Vélez Sársfield team that bowed out from the international limelight with their last title. Having failed to win the trophy in 1992 and 1993, <b>Cruzeiro</b> comfortably won the 1998 edition that was played {{as part of the}} Copa Mercosur. This final series was played two years after the participating teams won their corresponding qualifying tournaments.|$|E
5|$|Mineirão (officially Estádio Governador Magalhães Pinto) {{opened in}} 1965, and {{quickly became the}} home of both Atlético and <b>Cruzeiro,</b> as its peak {{capacity}} of over 100,000 spectators surpassed any other stadium in Belo Horizonte or in the state. The property {{of the state of}} Minas Gerais, Mineirão was Atlético's home from its opening until it closed in 2010 for renovations prior to the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The club temporarily moved to Arena do Jacaré in Sete Lagoas and subsequently to Independência in 2012. Historically the club's home ground, Atlético's most important matches have all been played at the Mineirão, a fact that has continued even after Independência became the first-choice home stadium again. After the renovation, the Mineirão has an overall capacity of 61,846.|$|E
50|$|Prices were quoted both in URVs and <b>cruzeiros</b> reais but {{payments}} {{had to be}} made {{exclusively in}} <b>cruzeiros</b> reais, since the URV would not become legal tender until July 1, 1994. For instance, banks were required to report balances on accounts in both currencies and contracts had to be rewritten to express prices in URVs.|$|R

5|$|In 1992, {{and from}} 1994 to 1997, the {{competition}} was played in Japan. Colo-Colo of Chile defeated <b>Cruzeiro</b> 5–4 on penalties after a 0–0 tie in the 1992 final. Staying true to the winning ways of the Paulista's golden generation, São Paulo won the 1993 and 1994 finals {{to become the first}} team to retain the title. Due to schedule congestion, the 1993 finals were played as part of the Campeonato Brasileiro and it also became the first Recopa to feature two teams from the same nation. In a second, consecutive all-Brazilian final, São Paulo successfully defended the trophy against Botafogo. Since São Paulo won both the Copa Libertadores and Supercopa Sudamericana, CONMEBOL had Copa CONMEBOL winners Botafogo dispute the Recopa Sudamericana only to lose 3–1 to the defending champions.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 {{the tournament}} severed its {{relationship}} with Toyota. Grupo Santander, {{one of the largest}} banks in the world, became the sponsor of the Copa Libertadores, and thus the official name changed to Copa Santander Libertadores. In that season, LDU Quito became the first team from Ecuador to win the Copa Libertadores after defeating Fluminense 3–1 on penalties. Goalkeeper Jose Francisco Cevallos played a key role, saving three penalties in the final shootout in what {{is considered one of the}} best ever final series in the competition's history. It was also the highest-scoring final in the history of the tournament. The biggest resurgence of the decade happened in the 50th edition of the Copa Libertadores and it was won by a former power that has reinvented itself. Estudiantes de La Plata, led by Juan Sebastián Verón, won their fourth title 39 long years after the successful generation of the 1960s (led by Juan Sebastián's father, Juan Ramón). The pincharatas managed to emulate their predecessors by defeating <b>Cruzeiro</b> 2–1 on the return leg in Belo Horizonte.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Atlético won the Campeonato Mineiro twice, in 1962 and 1963, {{but failed}} {{to advance to the}} later stages of the Taça Brasil. Mineirão, Belo Horizonte's new stadium, opened in 1965 and {{immediately}} became the club's home. It was in the mid-1960s that the rivalry with <b>Cruzeiro</b> became the biggest in the state, after this club won the first five state leagues of the Mineirão era. In 1967, another national-level competition was created by the CBD, the Torneio Roberto Gomes Pedrosa. It included more clubs than the Taça Brasil, but Atlético did not finish in the top-four in any of its editions in the decade. In {{the second half of the}} 1960s, highlights came in the form of friendlies against national sides. In 1968, Atlético, representing the Brazilian national team, defeated European Championship runners-up Yugoslavia 3–2 at the Mineirão; the following year, the Seleção itself, which would become champions of the 1970 FIFA World Cup, was defeated 2–1.|$|E

5|$|Under Levir Culpi, who {{returned}} to the club in 2014, Atlético won its first Recopa Sudamericana, defeating Lanús {{for the second time}} in a continental final. In that season's Copa do Brasil, after trailing 0–3 on aggregate in both the quarter-finals and semi-finals (against Corinthians and Flamengo, respectively), Atlético made 4–3 comebacks and advanced. The competition's finals were the first at national level to feature the Belo Horizonte rivals, and Atlético defeated <b>Cruzeiro</b> on both encounters to win its first Copa do Brasil. The club's successful run in the decade continued in 2015, when it won the Campeonato Mineiro and finished second in the Campeonato Brasileiro. In 2016, however, Atlético Mineiro ended the season without official trophies, finishing as runner-up of the Campeonato Mineiro and the Copa do Brasil, and in fourth place in the Brasileiro. The club achieved its 44th Campeonato Mineiro title in 2017.|$|E
5|$|In the 1964 Copa Libertadores, Santos {{were beaten}} in both {{legs of the}} semi-finals by Independiente. The club won the Campeonato Paulista, with Pelé netting 34 goals. Santos also shared the Rio-São Paulo title with Botafogo and won the Taça Brasil for the fourth {{consecutive}} year. In the 1965 Copa Libertadores, Santos reached the semi-finals and met Peñarol in a rematch of the 1962 final. After two matches, a playoff was needed to break the tie. Unlike 1962, Peñarol came out on top and eliminated Santos 2–1. Pelé would, however, finish as the topscorer of the tournament with eight goals. This {{proved to be the}} start of a decline as Santos failed to retain the Torneio Rio-São Paulo. In 1966, Pelé and Santos also failed to retain the Taça Brasil as Pelé's goals were not enough to prevent a 9–4 defeat by <b>Cruzeiro</b> (led by Tostão) in the final series. The club did, however, win the Campeonato Paulista in 1967, 1968 and 1969. On 19 November 1969, Pelé scored his 1000th goal in all competitions, in what was a highly anticipated moment in Brazil. The goal, popularly dubbed O Milésimo (The Thousandth), occurred in a match against Vasco da Gama, when Pelé scored from a penalty kick, at the Maracanã Stadium.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} decade, Atlético {{won the state}} league in 1991 and first saw success at continental level in 1992, when it won the inaugural Copa CONMEBOL. The team, managed by Procópio Cardoso, defeated Paraguay's Olimpia in the finals to claim its first official international title. As champion of that competition, the club {{took part in the}} 1993 Copa de Oro, in which it eliminated rivals <b>Cruzeiro</b> in the semi-finals but eventually lost to Argentina's Boca Juniors. After finishing fourth in the 1994 Brasileirão, {{the following}} year saw the club win the state league and reach the finals of the Copa CONMEBOL for a second time. This one ended in defeat to Argentine team Rosario Central on penalties, after Atlético won the first leg by 4–0 and lost the second one by the same score. In 1996, Atlético participated in the Copa Masters CONMEBOL, a competition between past winners of the Copa CONMEBOL that was played in Cuiabá; Atlético eliminated Rosario Central in the semi-finals but lost to São Paulo in the final match. The team also finished third in that year's Brasileiro and fourth in the following edition, falling in the semi-finals of both seasons. Another triumph came in the 1997 Copa CONMEBOL, when an Atlético team that included Marques and Cláudio Taffarel defeated Argentina's Lanús in the finals, and won the trophy for a second time. In 1999, after another Campeonato Mineiro title, a Galo side led by Marques and Guilherme, the top scorer in the league, reached the Série A finals for the fourth time, but lost to Corinthians. Despite international success and good performances in the Série A, the decade was marked by bad club administration by Atlético's presidents and deteriorating finances, which made the club one of the most indebted in Brazilian football.|$|E

5|$|As the 1992 Copa CONMEBOL winner, Atlético Mineiro {{qualified}} for the following year's edition of the competition, and for the 1993 edition of the Copa de Oro, a new tournament organised by CONMEBOL, contested between the winners of all the continental competitions of the previous year: Copa Libertadores, Copa CONMEBOL, Supercopa Libertadores, and Copa Master de Supercopa. In the Copa de Oro, Atlético faced its biggest rivals <b>Cruzeiro</b> in the semi-final, played as a single match at the Mineirão, the home stadium for both clubs, {{in front of a}} crowd of both team's fans. The game ended 00, and Atlético advanced to its second continental finals after winning a penalty shootout by 54. The team faced the Boca Juniors in the finals, and finished as runner-up after drawing the first leg 00 at the Mineirão, and losing the second 10 at La Bombonera. In the Copa CONMEBOL, Atlético again eliminated Fluminense in the first round (this time in a penalty shootout), and defeated Peru's Sipesa in the quarter-finals with an aggregate score of 21. Atlético club was eliminated in the semi-finals by Botafogo, the eventual winner of the tournament, after winning the first leg 31 at home, but losing the second 30.Absent from continental football for one season, Atlético Mineiro returned to the Copa CONMEBOL in the 1995 edition, qualifying after finishing fourth in the 1994 Brasileiro. The team eliminated Brazil's Guarani in the first stage with an aggregate score of 21, before defeating Venezuelan club Mineros de Guayana, with a club record home (60) and aggregate (100) win scores. In the semi-finals, Atlético faced Colombia's América de Cali, and advanced after winning a penalty shootout by 43, following a 43 away defeat, and a 10 home win. In its second Copa CONMEBOL final, Atlético faced Argentine side Rosario Central, and secured a significant advantage in the series with a 40 win at the Mineirão. However, in the second leg of the finals played in the Gigante de Arroyito, Atlético suffered a shocking 40 defeat, with a goal scored by Rosario at the 87th minute. The title was decided on penalties, with a 43 score favouring Central. In the following year, Atlético took part in the Copa Master de CONMEBOL, a single-edition competition contested in Cuiabá between the past winners of the Copa CONMEBOL: Atlético, Botafogo, São Paulo, and Rosario Central. Only {{a few months after the}} previous year's defeat, Atlético faced Central again, this time winning 109 on penalties after a 00 draw. Atlético lost to São Paulo 30 in the final match, played at the Verdão.|$|E
