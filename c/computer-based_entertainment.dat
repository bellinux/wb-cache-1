40|$|In this study, 150 {{undergraduates}} {{answered questions}} about their Internet usage and completed a loneliness and an Internet self-efficacy questionnaire. A {{factor analysis of the}} Internet usage items revealed three facets of online recreation, including, using the Internet for: <b>computer-based</b> <b>entertainment,</b> to facilitate offline entertainment, and for information about the entertainment world. Those who scored higher on loneliness were more likely to use the Internet for computer- based entertainment, as well as, use the Internet to obtain information about the entertainment world. Individuals higher in Internet self-efficacy were more likely to use the Internet for <b>computer-based</b> <b>entertainment</b> and to facilitate offline entertainment. Implications {{for the study of the}} psychological influences of the Internet are discussed in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Personal robots {{for human}} {{entertainment}} {{form a new}} class of <b>computer-based</b> <b>entertainment</b> that is beginning to become commercially and computationally practical. We expect a principal manifestation of their entertainment capabilities will be socially interactive game playing. We describe this form of gaming and summarize our current efforts in this direction on our lifelike, expressive, autonomous humanoid robot. Our focus is on teaching the robot via playful inter-action using natural social gesture and language. We detail this in terms of two broad categories: teaching as play and teaching with play. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} system for public {{interaction}} during presentations of non-interactive readymade (canned) materials such as films or pre-composed performances. Using concepts of user back-channeling, moderator and shared canvas, the system allows {{a significant part of}} an art piece that is actually happing "in the heads" of the audience to be shared in parallel or in sequential manner with the main show. We also briefly present the historical background of the blind manipulation of symbols (canned contents) and argue that a new cognitive paradigm is at work with user interaction in <b>computer-based</b> <b>entertainment</b> and digital art...|$|E
40|$|Advances in {{computer}} and communication technologies provide significant potentials for improving {{health and education}} systems that heavily depend on interaction, communication and visualization. Military training and flight simulation were among the earliest applications of computer-controlled virtual environments. The rapid growth in <b>computer-based</b> interactive <b>entertainment</b> extended such applications to other social and educational areas, due {{to the possibility of}} using computer game technology in non-entertainment cases. The concept of serious games also helped combine the digital entertainment technologies with more “serious ” topics. Online services like Second Lif...|$|R
40|$|The digital {{generation}} {{of a story}} in which users have influence over the narrative is emerging as an exciting example of <b>computer-based</b> interactive <b>entertainment.</b> Interactive storytelling has existed in non digital versions for thousand of years, but {{with the advent of}} the Web the demand for enabling distributed cyberdrama generation is becoming increasingly common. To govern the complexity stemming from the distributed {{generation of}} complex plots, we have devised an event synchronization service that may be exploited to support the distribution of interactive storytelling activities over the Web. The main novelty of our approach is that the semantics of the cyberdrama is exploited to discard obsolete events. This brings to the positive result of speeding up the activity of drama generation, thus enabling an augmented interactivity among dispersed players...|$|R
40|$|Felcza'’s {{analysis}} of discourses on {{work and play}} in big-budget video games {{is based on a}} method that draws on Mieke Bal's concept of focalization (2012) as well as the tools of operational logic developed by Noah Wardrip-Fruin (2012). The article aims to propose a research method that would link narratological research with a critical {{analysis of}} strategies used in the development and distribution of digital games. The main argument concerns the shifting definition of <b>computer-based</b> <b>entertainment,</b> from aimless play towards the development (and description) of games in terms of effort, work and reward. To illustrate her thesis, Felczak analyses the game Wolfenstein: The New Order as well as selected titles from the CRPG genre (from the series The Elder Scrolls and Fallout) ...|$|E
40|$|The current {{powerful}} graphics cards, providing stunning real-time {{visual effects}} for <b>computer-based</b> <b>entertainment,</b> have to accommodate powerful hardware components that {{are able to}} deliver the photo-realistic simulation to the end-user. Given the vast computing power of the graphics hardware, its producers very often offer a programming interface that makes it possible to use the computational resources of the graphics processors (GPU) to more general purposes. This step gave birth to the so-called GPGPU (general-purpose GPU) processors that – if programmed correctly – are able to achieve astonishing performance in floating point operations. In this paper we will briefly overview nVidia CUDA technology and we will demonstrate a process of developing a simple GPGPU application both in the native GPGPU style and in the add-ons for Matlab (Jacket and Parallel Toolbox) ...|$|E
40|$|Welcome to the Second International IFIP Entertainment Computing Symposium on st Cultural Computing (ECS 2010), {{which was}} part of the 21 IFIP World Computer Congress, held in Brisbane, Australia during September 21 – 23, 2010. On behalf of the people who made this conference happen, we wish to welcome you to this inter- tional event. The IFIP World Computer Congress has offered an {{opportunity}} for researchers and practitioners to present their findings and research results in several prominent areas of computer science and engineering. In the last World Computer Congress, WCC 2008, held in Milan, Italy in September 2008, IFIP launched a new initiative focused on all the relevant issues concerning computing and entertainment. As a - sult, the two-day technical program of the First Entertainment Computing Symposium (ECS 2008) provided a forum to address, explore and exchange information {{on the state of the}} art of <b>computer-based</b> <b>entertainment</b> and allied technologies, their design and use, and their impact on society. Based on the success of ECS 2008, at this Second IFIP Entertainment Computing Symposium (ECS 2010), our challenge was to focus on a new area in entertainment computing: cultural computing...|$|E
40|$|Leisure and entertainment-based {{computing}} {{has been}} traditionally associated with interactive entertainment media and game playing, yet {{the forms of}} engagement offered by these technologies only support {{a small part of}} how we act when we are at leisure. In this paper, we move away from the paradigm of leisure technology as <b>computer-based</b> <b>entertainment</b> consumption, and towards a broader view of leisure computing. This perspective is more in line with our everyday experience of leisure as an embodied, everyday accomplishment in which people artfully employ the everyday resources in the world around them in carrying out their daily lives outside of work. We develop this extended notion of leisure using data from a field study of domestic communication focusing on asynchronous and situated messaging to explore some of these issues, and develop these findings towards design implications for leisure technologies. Central to our discussion on the normal, everyday and occasioned conduct of leisure lie the notions of playfulness and creativity, the interweaving of the worlds of work and leisure, and in the creation of embodied displays of affect, all of which may be seen manifested in the use of messaging artefacts. This view of technology in support of leisure-in-the-broad is strongly divergent from traditional entertainment computing models in its coupling of the mechanics of the organisation of everyday life to the ways that we make entertainment for ourselves. This recognition allows us to draw specific implications for domestic situated messaging technologies, but also more generally for technology design by tying activities that we tend to regard as purely functional to other multifaceted and leisure-related purposes...|$|E
