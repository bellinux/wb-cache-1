30|$|Moreover, as {{creativity}} is a collective work, the creative person must possess skills to facilitate communication with other individuals, teamwork and the “sale” of the work. The literature lists, for example, intellectual courage to face apathy and rejection, {{as well as}} the ability to <b>sell</b> <b>ideas</b> as indispensable factors for this individual (Albrecht and Albrecht 1987), for it is through them that one can deal in a field of research and have their ideas accepted.

5000|$|Telling {{people they}} are smart, or beautiful, or that they are {{absolutely}} right has been a mainstay of marketing and politics since ancient times.

We're motivated by a kind of 'greenthink' that comes from the environmental movement and isn't mired in the old ideology of the left and right.

40|$|We study {{markets where}} innovators can <b>sell</b> <b>ideas</b> to entrepreneurs, {{who may be}} better at {{implementing}} them. These markets are decentralized, with random matching and bargaining. Entrepreneurs hold liquid assets lest potentially profitable opportunities may be lost. We extend existing models of the demand for liquidity along several dimensions, including allowing agents to put deals on hold while they try to raise funds. We determine which ideas get traded in equilibrium, compare this to the efficient outcome, and discuss policy implications. We also discuss several special aspects of ideas, as opposed to generic consumption goods: e. g. they are intermediate inputs; they are indivisible; and they are at least partially public (nonrivalous) goodsentrepreneurship, liquidity, random matching, monetary policy...|$|R

This happens in decentralized markets with random matching and bilateral bargaining. Entrepreneurs hold liquid assets (e. g. cash) lest potentially pro…table opportunities may be lost. Contributing to the literature on innovation and technology transfer, we show how bargaining and liquidity costs (e. g. interest rates) determine which ideas get traded. Contributing to monetary theory, we generalize recent models to the case where agents exchange indivisible objects (these are ideas here) with random valuations, and we allow buyers with insu ¢ cient liquidity {{to try to put}} deals on hold until they can raise the cash.

40|$|Ever since Sperber and Wilson {{presented}} their theory of relevance, {{a lot of}} work has been done to corroborate or to refute it as the best available communication theory. What is known is that throughout the years not only linguists but cognitive theorists in general have applied the principles of Relevance theory to explain different phenomena concerning aspects of human communication. Our paper is no different. It discusses the possibilities of analysing advertisements with verbal and visual elements through relevance theory, specifically in terms of what triggers inferential comprehension in such pieces. The three pieces analysed do not engage in selling marketing products, but they <b>sell</b> <b>ideas</b> that become ostensive by means of merging visual and linguistic inputs to inferential understanding of what they mean...|$|R
