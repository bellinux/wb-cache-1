60|$|I want {{to explain}} to {{everybody}} how it was I came {{to go to church}} without stockings on, so that everybody will know that father was not to blame one bit for it, and the old gossips need not say he is, because it is not true. I gave my only pair of black stockings to Lida Marsh, because she hadn't any and her poor little feet were awful cold and I was so sorry for her. No child ought to have to go without shoes and stockings in a Christian community before the snow is all gone, and I think the W. F. M. S. ought to have given her stockings. Of course, I know they are sending things to the little heathen children, and that is all right and a kind thing to do. But the little heathen children have lots more warm weather than we have, and I think the women of our church ought to look after Lida and not leave it all to me. When I gave her my stockings I forgot they were the only black pair I had without holes, but I am glad I did give them to her, because my conscience would have been uncomfortable if I hadn't. When she had gone away, looking so proud and happy, the poor little thing, I remembered that all I had to wear were the horrid red and blue things Aunt Martha knit last winter for me out of some yarn that Mrs. Joseph Burr of Upper Glen sent us. It was dreadfully <b>coarse</b> <b>yarn</b> and all knots, and I never saw any of Mrs. Burr's own children wearing things made of such yarn. But Mary Vance says Mrs. Burr gives the minister stuff that she can't use or eat herself, and thinks it ought to go as part of the salary her husband signed to pay, but never does.|$|E
60|$|We {{went into}} several other rooms, {{at the doors}} of which, pausing on the outside, {{we could hear the}} volubility, and {{sometimes}} the wrangling, of the female inhabitants within, but invariably found silence and peace, when we stepped over the threshold. The women were grouped together in their sitting-rooms, sometimes three or four, sometimes a larger number, classified by their spontaneous affinities, I suppose, and all busied, so far as I can remember, with the one occupation of knitting <b>coarse</b> <b>yarn</b> stockings. Hardly any of them, I am sorry to say, had a brisk or cheerful air, though it often stirred them up to a momentary vivacity to be accosted by the governor, and they seemed to like being noticed, however slightly, by the visitors. The happiest person whom I saw there (and, running hastily through my experiences, I hardly recollect to have seen a happier one in my life, if you take a careless flow of spirits as happiness) was an old woman that lay in bed among ten or twelve heavy-looking females, who plied their knitting-work round about her. She laughed, when we entered, and immediately began to talk to us, in a thin, little, spirited quaver, claiming {{to be more than a}} century old; and the governor (in whatever way he happened to be cognizant of the fact) confirmed her age to be a hundred and four. Her jauntiness and cackling merriment were really wonderful. It was as if she had got through with all her actual business in life two or three generations ago, and now, freed from every responsibility for herself or others, had only to keep up a mirthful state of mind till the short time, or long time (and, happy as she was, she appeared not to care whether it were long or short), before Death, who had misplaced her name in his list, might remember to take her away. She had gone quite round the circle of human existence, and come back to the play-ground again. And so she had grown to be a kind of miraculous old pet, the plaything of people seventy or eighty years younger than herself, who talked and laughed with her as if she were a child, finding great delight in her wayward and strangely playful responses, into some of which she cunningly conveyed a gibe that caused their ears to tingle a little. She had done getting out of bed in this world, and lay there to be waited upon like a queen or a baby.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the first}} {{mathematical}} societies in England {{was set up by}} the Huguenot silk weavers of Spitalfields in London. Towards the end of the 18 th century their trade began to decline rapidly, due to competition {{from other parts of the}} textile trade, in particular the cotton trade. Originally cotton could only be spun into <b>coarse</b> <b>yarn,</b> which was unsuitable for fashionable clothes, but eventually it became possible to produce cotton yarn that was both fine and cheap in relation to silk. I shall discuss an application of Mathematics that arose essentially because it was important to control accurately the fineness of the yarn. The fineness of cotton (and woollen) yarn was expressed in a way that appears clumsy to us nowadays, because it was based on centuries of trade practice, rather than scientific principles. This inevitably led to complicated calculations. One way of avoiding the difficulty was to use a specially-designed instrument, such as the bent-lever balance. The theory of this instrument was discussed by William Ludlam in 1765, using mechanics, trigonometry and calculus. His analysis is a good example of the ‘Newtonian ’ style, and despit...|$|E
40|$|An {{unusually large}} amount of Bronze Age {{textiles}} have been preserved in southern Scandinavia. My research on the Bronze Age textiles has focused on yarn diameter and twist angles, sources of variation in an apparent uniform material. Differences in the textiles are due to varying quality of raw materials and the usage {{of different types of}} tools, but also the skill of the craftsperson and how the handcraft knowledge is transmitted to new generations. The room for variation and creativity in the handcraft seems to be closely linked to the education strategy. The South Scandinavian textile material can be separated in two different groups. The specialized textiles show high technical variation, produced to fulfill specific tasks as belts, corded skirts or hair nets. The generalized textiles, tabby woven and visually uniform, are used in all the known woven Bronze Age clothing. The yarns of the specialized textiles have shown to be more even than the <b>coarse</b> <b>yarn</b> of the generalized textiles. The knowledge of generalized textiles has probably been taught in a cultural conservative way, giving the textiles a very uniform appearance and little room for variation. The specialized textiles had more room for innovation and variation, and were probably made by more specialized crafts people taking their higher complexity. Several changes in the textile handcraft took place between PII and PIII. The generalized textiles show less uniformity and change from s/ztextiles to s/s-textiles. This change might be linked to an alteration of ideological beliefs concerning the spin direction. A high amount of generalized textiles are found in oak-coffin graves. In order to produce this amount of textiles one must have had access to a big amount of resources and enough skilled craftspeople. Both the spinning of the wool and the weaving was a job for several people. The specialized textiles are not so numerous and required less resources. Only one craftsperson was needed to make the yarn and do the weaving of for example a belt. Due to the dissimilar nature of the textile groups they can be linked to two different kinds of style. The uniform generalized textiles could have been used as emblemic style, communicating a common South Scandinavian Bronze Age Identity. The specialized textiles, however, have a variation {{that can be used for}} assertive style, communicating personal identity. Especially female graves have show to contain a high number of very different kinds of specialized textiles. </p...|$|E

Its application on the <b>coarser</b> <b>yarn</b> counts (7 - 32 Ne) showed notable advantages in modified yarn and fabric performance.

Thus this paper aims to carry out a systematic study of the physical properties of the finer modified yarns (80 Ne) and woven fabrics with respect to the conventional ones. Physical properties of conventional and modified single yarns were evaluated and compared. These two types of single yarn were used for the production of woven fabrics. Moreover, the above two types of single yarn were also plied and used for the production of woven fabrics under a commercial condition. All woven fabrics were assessed in terms of fabric tensile strength, tearing strength, abrasion resistance, fabric weight, and air-permeability as well as other fabric performance measured by the Kawabata Evaluation System (KES).
