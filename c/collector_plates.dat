40|$|Water {{is vital}} for human activity. In the past {{abundant}} fresh water supplies {{were believed to be}} limitless. In the last two decades dwindling reserves of freely accessible water at the surface and subsurface environment have raised community awareness about the need to ensure that industrial production operates in a sustainable way that won’t constrain the development and sustainability of regional cities and towns that draw on downstream ground waters for their potable and non potable water requirements. In this paper, a method of augmenting the widely practiced evaporation pond approach is investigated for disposing of brine wastewaters to improve the sustainability of industrial operators employing this practice. The approach involves the adoption of solar <b>plate</b> <b>collector</b> technology. The solar technology referred to as unglazed transpired collectors (UTCs). It may be considered a hybrid concept as it’s a UTC except inclined like a typical solar <b>collector</b> <b>plate.</b> A pilot scale <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> unit was designed and constructed to evaluate the enhanced evaporation capabilities of a <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> unit (UTCs). The experimental program covered a 14 month study period from June 2005 to August, 2006. This research investigated the ability to enhance evaporation using three different brine concentrations (3. 5 % NaCl, 7. 0 % NaCl and 12. 5 % NaCl), and three film heights (0. 15 mm, 0. 2 mm and 0. 3 mm) over a 14 month experimental period between June 2005 and August 2006. The research investigated the relationship between key weather parameters, solar irradiation (MJ/m 2 /d), wind speed (m/s), ambient air temperature (°C), and relative humidity (%), and enhanced evaporation and <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> evaporation from the <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> unit. Data analysis found weather conditions low in relative humidity (less than 40 %), high in total incident solar radiation (greater than 20 MJ/m 2 /d), steady, constant wind speeds (between 1. 1 and 1. 3 m/s), and high daily average air temperatures (greater than 25 °C) would generally produce evaporation enhancement ratio (EER) results between 2. 0 and 3. 0 for brine solutions with concentrations up to 7. 0 % NaCl. The peak EER result of 3. 01 (achieved during summer) equated to the <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> unit achieving a rate of evaporation 301 % higher than an equivalent surface area of evaporation pond containing similar brine wastewater and subject to similar weather conditions. The mean EER result over the 14 month sampling period was 1. 52. The research found in the scenario where 100 nr <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> 1 m 2 units were connected to an evaporation pond covering 20, 000 m 2 and 1 m in depth, subject to typical Melbourne CBD weather conditions, and a testing period of 100 days. The <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> unit had the potential to reduce the surface area by 0. 44 % representing an 88 m 2 reduction in surface area for the 1 m deep evaporation pond. An energy balance was developed for the <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> unit that considered energy {{in and out of the}} unit, by way of solar radiation, convection and evaporation. It was found the <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> lost over 49 % of its energy to evaporation as compared with 76 % by the evaporation pond due to evaporation under the same weather conditions. The research found <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> technology had the potential for augmenting existing and future evaporation ponds located in regions and countries where the meteorological conditions are favourable to evaporation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the relationship between solar dryer geometry and the drying rate of seeds; hence the analysis of the effects of a flat plate solar dryer geometry on drying rate of Agricultural seeds is presented using a case study of Ogbono seeds (Irvingea gabonensis). Ogbono seeds were dried using a distributed type, forced convention solar drying system, consisting of a solar <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> of a geometric area (A), thickness (D) and tilt angle (β). The drying rates of the Ogbono seeds were obtained for <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> Areas of 0. 24, 0. 42 and 0. 60 m 2; tilt angles of 0, 5, 10 and 15 º; absorber plate thicknesses of 1. 50, 2. 70 and 4. 20 mm. The graphs of Area (A) of <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> against drying rate showed that the drying rates increased linearly with the increase in the area of <b>collector</b> <b>plate.</b> From the graphs of angles of tilt against drying rate, it was evident that the drying rate generally increased curvlinearly to a point with the increase in the tilt angle. From that point of inflection, the drying rate decreased with the increase in the tilt angle of the plate. A maximum drying rate of 10. 03 % m. c/h was obtained for the Ogbono seeds during the field test. This maximum rate of drying occurred for <b>collector</b> <b>plate</b> area of 0. 60 m 2, tilt angle of 5 o and plate thickness of 2. 70 mm. The corresponding collector efficiency is 57 %...|$|R
