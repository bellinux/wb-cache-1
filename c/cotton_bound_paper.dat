The Indestructo Glass company proposed using [...] thick Perspex, while the AMRE team preferred a composite material of polystyrene fabric and Egyptian <b>cotton</b> <b>bound</b> with phenol formaldehyde resin (the glue used in Bakelite), or a similar paper-based resin composite. The Perspex solution was chosen, and in December 1940 Bristol Blenheim N3522, a night fighter adaptation of the Blenheim V, arrived at RAF Christchurch, the nearest suitable airfield. A number of attempts had to be made to successfully mount the nose to their test aircraft. It was not until the spring of 1941 that Indestructo delivered suitable radomes and the mounting issues were wholly solved.|$|R

For each design guideline, we describe a design scenario illustrating these principles in action...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a {{quantitative assessment of}} the use of fiscal stimulus to achieve full recovery from a severe recession when the potency of monetary policy weakens after hitting its zero interest-rate bound. By contrast, most of the numerous recent zero interest-rate <b>bound</b> <b>papers</b> have ignored the use of fiscal stimulus, preferring to examine whether monetary policy alone can revive the economy despite the zero bound. We obtain our estimates by adapting and simulating a macro-econometric model that has been recently econometrically estimated, updated, and statistically tested using U. S. times series data. By contrast, most of the recent zero <b>bound</b> <b>papers</b> do not use an econometrically-estimated model. If the U. S. economy were hit with a large negative demand shock that drives the unemployment rate up to 7. 9 %, we estimate that even aggressive monetary policy that drives long-term interest rates to near zero would reduce the unemployment rate only to 6. 7 %. Full recovery would be achieved, however, if the aggressive monetary policy were complemented by sufficient fiscal stimulus in the form of cash transfers or income tax cuts to households. We estimate that a quarterly transfer to households that peaks at 2. 7 % of quarterly GDP and phases out gradually as it is repeated over seven quarters (so that the cumulative transfer is roughly 12 % of quarterly GDP) would reduce the unemployment rate in such a recession by nearly an additional percentage pointC from 6. 7 % to 5. 9 %. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the use of}} bounded rationality in industrial organization. There is {{a long tradition of}} such work: literatures from various decades have discussed irrationalities by firms and consumers. Three main approaches are found in the recent literature: rule-of-thumb papers specify simple rules for behavior; explicit <b>bounds</b> <b>papers</b> consider agents who maximize payoffs net of cognitive costs; the psychology and economics approach typically cites experimental evidence to motivate utility-like framworks. Common to each recent literature is a focus on consumer irrationalities that firms might exploit. I discuss several new topics that have been opened up by the consideration of bounded rationality and new perspectives that have been provided on traditional topics...|$|R
