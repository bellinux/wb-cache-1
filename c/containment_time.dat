40|$|Concepts for {{the final}} {{disposal}} of radioactive wastes are abstract models based upon available basic research data and known technology. The geosciences {{play a major role}} in their development because most involve deep burial below the biospere as well as estimates of the future effects of geological processes over long periods of time (10 3 - 10 6 yr). Disposal concepts are best classified for geological discussion according to two criteria: type of waste and regional significance. Waste type determines the volume of material to be treated and the necessary Containment times, and leads to (1) concepts for low-active waste (LAW) without alpha-emitters (large volume, <b>Containment</b> <b>time</b> ⇐ 10 3 yr) and (2) concepts for high-active waste containing long lived alpha-emitting isotopes (small volume, <b>containment</b> <b>time</b> 10 5 - 10 6 yr). Regional significance defines the organisational framework and leads to (A) concepts of burial in the continental crust within national boundaries (strongly dependent on local geological conditions) and (B) concepts of disposal in unpopulated, biologically inactive areas on an international basis (directed by global geoscientific considerations). A 2 and B 2 concepts present the greatest difficulties in attempts to turn them into research and development programmes and pilot projects which are both politically acceptable and scientifically sound. Consideration of A 2 concepts shows the complicated factors and value judgments involved in assessing the suitability of different host rocks (salt, anhydrite, argillaceous rocks, granite, basalt, tuff). The "Earth science technical plan for mined geologic disposal of radioactive waste" of the U. S. Dept. of Energy is the most advanced attempt to put R and D in this direction on a coordinated, scientific basis within a logical framework. The only B 2 concept which has developed into an international R and D programme is that of disposal in ocean floor Sediments at mid-plate, mid-gyre locations.

Type III ELMs have also been observed in NSTX, as well as a high-performance regime with small ELMs which we designate Type V.

Similarly, availability can only be achieved if availability parameters meet certain performance requirements, e.g., the time to recover from a failure and the rate of successful recovery from failures (ρ). Also, specific performance requirements (throughput, speed/speedup, and bandwidth) need to be defined in terms of reliability, availability, and maintenance parameters. For example, the throughput of a wireless system can be obtained only under specific packet loss rate.

In the early 1970 s, Dwight Jaeger of Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) developed a single-step, two-species kinetics system {{that was used in}} the development of one of the first finite element codes for thermal analyses known as EXPLO. Jaeger's research focused on unconfined spherical samples of HE charges to determine if varied heating ramps would cause detonation or deflagration. Tarver and McGuire of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) followed soon after with a three-step, four-species kinetics system that was developed for confined spheres under relatively fast heating conditions. Peter Dickson et al. of LANL then introduced a kinetics system with four steps and five species that included bimolecular products to capture the effects of the endothermic phase change that the HE undergoes. The results of four experiments are examined to study the effectiveness of these kinetics systems. The experiments are: (1) The LLNL scaled thermal explosion (STEX) experiments on confined cylindrical charges with long heating ramps in the range of 90 hours.

40|$|A fast {{running and}} simple {{computer}} code {{has been developed}} to calculate pressure loadings inside light water reactor containments/confinements under loss-of-coolant accident conditions. PACER was originally developed to calculate containment/confinement pressure and temperature time histories for loss-of-coolant accidents in Soviet-designed VVER reactors and is relevant to {{the activities of the}} US International Nuclear Safety Center. The code employs a multicompartment representation of the containment volume and is focused upon application to early <b>time</b> <b>containment</b> phenomena during and immediately following blowdown. PACER has been developed for FORTRAN 77 and earlier versions of FORTRAN. The code has been successfully compiled and executed on SUN SPARC and Hewlett-Packard HP- 735 workstations provided that appropriate compiler options are specified. The code incorporates both capabilities built around a hardwired default generic VVER- 440 Model V 230 design as well as fairly general user-defined input. However, array dimensions are hardwired and must be changed by modifying the source code if the number of compartments/cells differs from the default number of nine. Detailed input instructions are provided as well as a description of outputs. Input files and selected output are presented for two sample problems run on both HP- 735 and SUN SPARC workstations...|$|R
