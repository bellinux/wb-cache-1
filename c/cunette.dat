50|$|The halls {{used for}} {{connections}} in the station La Motte-Picquet - Grenelle are decorated with various coats of arms of the Toussaint-Guillaume Picquet de la Motte family (blue with three golden chevrons, accompanied by three silver arrowheads). A fresco represents the barrière de la <b>Cunette,</b> {{one of the doors}} of the Wall of the Farmers-General that was one situated where the station is now.|$|E
50|$|The station opened {{as part of}} {{the former}} Line 2 South on 24 April 1906, when it was {{extended}} from Passy to Place d'Italie. On 14 October 1907 Line 2 South was incorporated into Line 5. It was incorporated into line 6 on 12 October 1942. The station was called Quai de Grenelle until 1949, when it was renamed to commemorate the battle of Bir Hakeim. A commemorative panel is situated at the entrance of the platform for trains traveling towards Nation. The station was the location of the Barrière de la <b>Cunette,</b> a gate built for the collection of taxation {{as part of the}} Wall of the Farmers-General; the gate was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished in the nineteenth century.|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this Master`s thesis is the river {{training}} of the Luha river in Jeseník nad Odrou. The thesis is divided into several chapters. In the theoretical introduction, {{the problems of the}} sediment flow regime are discussed. Moreover, it deals with the questions associated with the roughness in open channels and adjustment of riparian zones. As a part of the overall proposal of the flow adjustment, the hydraulically most suitable cross section in <b>cunette</b> is proposed. It is done with respect to the desired velocity ratios in the profile. Since the new <b>cunette</b> shape was established, the adjustment of vertical alignment was proposed. The thesis also contains the capacity assessment of the existing channel. Design of adjustment of flood protection measures includes mainly spatial rearrangement and increase the crest of levees with respect to the local conditions. The thesis also suggests the placement of vegetation in the riparian zones. Furhermore, the work deals with problems arising from the flow adjustment considering applicable laws and regulations of the Czech Republic. In the case of project implementation, it is necessary to evaluate these problems independently...|$|E
