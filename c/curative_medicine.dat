However, such an approach was problematic as a person could {{have more than one}} disease at a time (Aph. 40-44). This then required a principle to organize the symptoms into an identifiable complex (Inbegriff) correspondent to a given disease state. Just as each tonic disease has a unique state of mind disturbance, so does each pathic disease contain a unique disturbance of the thermal organization in man. This approach to pathic diseases Hahnemann termed homeopathy (from the Greek homoios and pathos, or similar suffering).

Before founding CRHP in 1970, the couple worked in the Marathi Mission Hospital in Vadala from 1962-1966 and spent time in the US completing their medicine & surgery residencies as well as obtaining MPH degrees at Johns Hopkins University. The idea of CRHP was born during the Aroles’ time at Johns Hopkins and was also based on their prior experiences with the rural poor.

(maps) This dissertation {{is a historical}} analysis of colonial state infant welfare initiatives from preventive programs of the 1920 s and early 1930 s to policies that integrated preventive and <b>curative</b> <b>medicine</b> in the late 1930 s and 1940 s in colonial Tanzania. It argues {{that the development of}} these medical interventions was a negotiated process between colonial government officials, peasants, local chiefs, welfare workers, African dressers, and medical missions. In the 1920 s the British colonial government initiated the welfare programs to reduce high infant mortality rates. Government officials explained poor infant survival in terms of maternal ignorance and focused on advising mothers on proper infant care, feeding, and hygiene. The government trained African welfare workers who performed the actual work of advising mothers in the communities. Peasants, however, challenged the early preventive programs as narrowly conceived both because they ignored local medical knowledge and indigenous practices and because they excluded western <b>curative</b> <b>medicine</b> that would help them tackle infant diseases such as malaria. Using their local chiefs, peasants demanded that the colonial government incorporate <b>curative</b> <b>medicine</b> in its welfare policies. Their bargaining strategies to achieve these demands included boycotting government-run welfare centers and refusing to pay taxes. The government eventually incorporated <b>curative</b> <b>medicine</b> in its welfare programs in the late 1930 s, and it trained African dressers in preventive and <b>curative</b> <b>medicine.</b> The evidence for this dissertation comes from oral interviews, written archival documents, ethnographic accounts, and missionary and explorers' writings.

Most of the existing works adopt single clustering algorithms to detect outlier patterns from bio-molecular data. However, single clustering algorithms lack robustness, stability and accuracy. This work uses a form of semi-supervised cluster ensemble to analyze outlier patterns based on their relations to clusters. Specifically, the prior knowledge of a dataset is fed to the cluster ensemble {{in the form of}} constraints. The clusters produced are analyzed for detecting outliers by filtering out insignificant clusters. Then, the outlier-cluster association is calculated using a fuzzy approach.
