6000|$|January 4.--My enemy {{gained some}} {{strength}} during the watches of the night, but has again succumbed under scalding fomentations of <b>camomile</b> <b>flowers.</b> I still keep my state, for my knee, {{though it has}} ceased to pain me, is very feeble. We began to fill the ice-house to-day. Dine alone--en famille, that is, Jane, Anne, Walter, and I. Why, this makes up for aiches, as poor John Kemble used to call them. After tea I broke off work, and read my young folks the farce of the Critic, and [...] "merry folks were we." ...|$|E
40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Germany, herewith {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), received an application from the Landesanstalt für Landwirtschaft Forsten und Gartenbau Sachsen-Anhalt to modify the existing MRLs for the propyzamide in herbal infusions. In order to accommodate for the intended use of propyzamide in Germany, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs in leaves and flowers of herbal infusions to 0. 4 mg/kg and in roots of herbal infusions to 0. 15 mg/kg. According to EFSA, the residue data are sufficient to support the extrapolation of residue data on dried peppermint, lemon balm leaves, narrow leaf plantain and <b>camomile</b> <b>flowers</b> to the whole group of dried leaves and flowers of herbal infusions with a MRL proposal of 0. 4 mg/kg. The submitted residue data on black snakeroot can be extrapolated to dried roots of herbal infusions with a MRL proposal of 0. 02 mg/kg (the LOQ). The applicant has to confirm the applicability of the enforcement method to analyse propyzamide residues in dried herbs. A minor data gap was identified regarding the freezer storage stability of propyzamide in dry matrices. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the intended use of propyzamide on the crops under consideration and the use of dried plant parts (leaves, flowers and roots) in herbal infusions will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference value and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} the investigation of the extractive bioconversion of apigenin- 7 -O-β-glucoside in <b>camomile</b> ligulate <b>flowers</b> into apigenin by autofermentation in polyethylene glycol 6000 / dextran 200000 two-phase system. In 22. 5 % polyethylene glycol / 14 % dextran aqueous two-phase system the obtained yield of apigenin in the top phase was 96. 5 %. In the presence of plant material that partiotioned to the interphase, the yield of apigenin in the top phase was 3. 5 times higher in comparison to the model system...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the variation of salivary micro-crystallization saliva index (IMK) in patients with gastroesophageal reflux desease, after utilisation of a remineralization product. Materials and method. Twelve patients suffering from gastroesophageal reflux were included in the study. Unstimulated saliva was collected in the same day and at the same hour for each patient. A total amount of 0. 5 ml of unstimulated saliva was placed on a glass plate, dried for 30 min in a thermostate at + 37 oC, then analyzed on a Nikon Eclipse E 600 device. The images were saved and stored in a computer. The IMK index was determined using formula: IMK= none of the eye network points projected on crystals/ none of the eye network points projected on the entire saliva drop. All patients were subjected to dental hard tissues remineralization using Recaldent MI Paste (GC Corporation) for 3 weeks, after which the IMK index was determined for each patient. Results. The appearance of crystals formed by saliva precipitation on the plates corresponds to one of these aspects: dendrite-shaped crystals, <b>camomile</b> <b>flower,</b> multiple points, micronetwork, cube or egg-shaped forms. The mean values of the IMK index varied from 0. 4 before tratment to 0. 9 after remineralization with Recaldent MI Paste. Conclusions. Recaldent MI Paste increased the remineralization capacity of saliva when applied to patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease. ...|$|R
60|$|Siegmund lay and clasped the sand, {{and tossed}} it in handfuls till over him he was all hot and cloyed. Then he rose and looked at himself and laughed. The water was swaying reproachfully against the steep pebbles below, murmuring like a child {{that it was not}} fair--it was not fair he should abandon his playmate. Siegmund laughed, and began to rub himself free of the {{clogging}} sand. He found himself strangely dry and smooth. He tossed more dry sand, and more, over himself, busy and intent like a child playing some absorbing game with itself. Soon his body was dry and warm and smooth as a <b>camomile</b> <b>flower.</b> He was, however, greyed and smeared with sand-dust. Siegmund looked at himself with disapproval, though his body was full of delight and his hands glad with the touch of himself. He wanted himself clean. He felt the sand thick in his hair, even in his moustache. He went painfully over the pebbles till he found himself on the smooth rock bottom. Then he soused himself, and shook his head in the water, and washed and splashed and rubbed himself with his hands assiduously. He must feel perfectly clean and free--fresh, as if he had washed away all the years of soilure in this morning's sea and sun and sand. It was the purification. Siegmund became again a happy priest of the sun. He felt as if all the dirt of misery were soaked out of him, as he might soak clean a soiled garment in the sea, and bleach it white on the sunny shore. So white and sweet and tissue-clean he felt--full of lightness and grace.|$|R
50|$|Some lawns are {{replaced}} with low ground covers, such as creeping thyme, <b>camomile,</b> Lippia, purple <b>flowering</b> Mazus, grey Dymondia, creeping sedums, and creeping jenny.An {{example of this}} is the floral lawn in Avondale Park. Other alternatives to lawns include meadows, drought-tolerant xeriscape gardens, natural landscapes, native plant habitat gardens, paved Spanish courtyard and patio gardens, butterfly gardens, rain gardens, tapestry lawn and kitchen gardens. Trees and shrubs in close proximity to lawns provide habitat for birds in traditional, cottage and wildlife gardens.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} polyphenol-containing beverages on Fe absorption from a bread meal were estimated in adult human subjects from the erythrocyte incorporation of radio-Fe. The test beverages contained different polyphenol structures and were rich in either phenolic acids (chlorogenic acid in coffee), monomeric flavonoids (herb teas, camomile (Matricaria recutita L.)), vervain (Verbena officinalis L.), lime flower (Tilia cordata Mill.), pennyroyal (Mentha pulegium L.) and peppermint (Mentha piperita L.), or complex polyphenol polymerization products (black tea and cocoa). All beverages were potent inhibitors of Fe absorption and reduced absorption in a dose-dependent fashion {{depending on the}} content of total polyphenols. Compared with a water control meal, beverages containing 20 - 50 mg total polyphenols/serving reduced Fe absorption from the bread meal by 50 - 70 %, whereas beverages containing 100 - 400 mg total polyphenols/serving reduced Fe absorption by 60 - 90 %. Inhibition by black tea was 79 - 94 %, peppermint tea 84 %, pennyroyal 73 %, cocoa 71 %, vervain 59 %, lime flower 52 % and camomile 47 %. At an identical concentration of total polyphenols, black tea was more inhibitory than cocoa, and more inhibitory than herb teas <b>camomile,</b> vervain, lime <b>flower</b> and pennyroyal, but was of equal inhibition to peppermint tea. Adding milk to coffee and tea had little or no influence on their inhibitory nature. Our findings demonstrate that herb teas, as well as black tea, coffee and cocoa can be potent inhibitors of Fe absorption. This property should be considered when giving dietary advice in relation to Fe nutritio...|$|R
