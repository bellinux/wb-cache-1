5|$|Halogenated refrigerants, termed Freons in {{informal}} contexts, {{are identified}} by R-numbers that denote {{the amount of}} fluorine, chlorine, carbon, and hydrogen present. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) like R-11, R-12, and R-114 once dominated organofluorines, peaking in production in the 1980s. Used for air conditioning systems, propellants and solvents, their production was below one-tenth of this peak by the early 2000s, after widespread international prohibition. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were designed as replacements; their synthesis consumes more than 90% of the fluorine in the organic industry. Important HCFCs include R-22, <b>chlorodifluoromethane,</b> and R-141b. The main HFC is R-134a with {{a new type of}} molecule HFO-1234yf, a Hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) coming to prominence owing to its global warming potential of less than 1% that of HFC-134a.|$|E

50|$|R-406A is a {{refrigerant}} {{invented by}} George H Goble. It {{is a mixture}} of three components <b>chlorodifluoromethane</b> (R-22), isobutane (R-600a) and chlorodifluoroethane (R-142b) in the ratio 55/4/41.|$|E
50|$|Bromochlorodifluoromethane is commercially synthetized in a two-step way. First, {{chloroform}} is fluorinated with hydrogen fluoride.

50|$|The most {{important}} is dichloromethane, which is mainly used as a solvent. Chloromethane is a precursor to chlorosilanes and silicones. Historically significant, but smaller in scale is chloroform, mainly a precursor to <b>chlorodifluoromethane</b> (CHClF2) and tetrafluoroethene which {{is used in the}} manufacture of Teflon.|$|E
5000|$|Awarding Carbon Credits for {{destroying}} the greenhouse gas HFC-23 incentivized increased manufacture of the coolant HCFC-22 (<b>chlorodifluoromethane)</b> whose production included HFC-23 as a by-product. This increased production caused {{the price of}} the coolant to decrease significantly, incentivizing refrigeration companies to continue using it, despite the adverse environmental effects.|$|E
50|$|Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and {{hydrofluorocarbons}} (HFCs) now {{serve as}} replacements for CFC refrigerants; few were commercially manufactured before 1990. Currently more than 90% of fluorine used for organics goes into these two classes (in about equal amounts). Prominent HCFCs include R-22 (<b>chlorodifluoromethane)</b> and R-141b (1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane). The main HFC is R-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane).|$|E
50|$|Before {{they became}} {{strictly}} regulated, {{the general public}} often encountered haloalkanes as paint and cleaning solvents such as trichloroethane (1,1,1-trichloroethane) and carbon tetrachloride (tetrachloromethane), pesticides like 1,2-dibromoethane (EDB, ethylene dibromide), and refrigerants like Freon-22 (duPont trademark for <b>chlorodifluoromethane).</b> Some haloalkanes are still widely used for industrial cleaning, such as methylene chloride (dichloromethane), and as refrigerants, such as R-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane).|$|E

50|$|The ozone {{depletion}} potential (ODP) of a chemical compound is the relative amount of degradation to the ozone layer it can cause, with trichlorofluoromethane (R-11 or CFC-11) being fixed at an ODP of 1.0. <b>Chlorodifluoromethane</b> (R-22), for example, has an ODP of 0.05. CFC 11, or R-11 has the maximum potential amongst chlorocarbons {{because of the presence}} of three chlorine atoms in the molecule.|$|E
50|$|Trifluoromethane (HFC-23) is {{generated}} and emitted as a byproduct during {{the production of}} <b>chlorodifluoromethane</b> (HCFC-22). HCFC-22 is used both in emissive applications (primarily air conditioning and refrigeration) and as a feedstock for production of synthetic polymers. Because HCFC-22 depletes stratospheric ozone, its production for non-feedstock uses {{is scheduled to be}} phased out under the Montreal Protocol. However, feedstock production is permitted to continue indefinitely.|$|E
50|$|Some CDM {{projects}} remove {{or destroy}} industrial gases, such as hydrofluorocarbon-23 (HFC-23) and nitrous oxide (N2O). HFC-23 {{is a potent}} greenhouse gas (GHG) and is a byproduct from {{the production of the}} refrigerant gas <b>chlorodifluoromethane</b> (HCFC-22). The gas HFC-23 is estimated to have a global warming effect 11,000 times greater than carbon dioxide, so destroying a tonne of HFC-23 earns the refrigerant manufacturer 11,000 certified emissions reduction units.|$|E
50|$|Charles (Boss) Kettering, vice {{president}} of General Motors Research Corporation, was seeking a refrigerant replacement that would be colorless, odorless, tasteless, nontoxic, and nonflammable. He assembled a team that included Thomas Midgley, Jr., Albert Leon Henne, and Robert McNary. From 1930 to 1935, they developed dichlorodifluoromethane (CCl2F2 or R12), trichlorofluoromethane (CCl3F or R11), <b>chlorodifluoromethane</b> (CHClF2 or R22), trichlorotrifluoroethane (CCl2FCClF2 or R113), and dichlorotetrafluoroethane (CClF2CClF2 or R114), through Kinetic Chemicals which was {{a joint venture between}} DuPont and General Motors.|$|E
50|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is 60-80% of the world's {{fluoropolymer}} {{production on}} a weight basis. The term Teflon is sometimes used generically for the substance, {{but is a}} DuPont brand name—other PTFE producers exist and DuPont sometimes uses the Teflon brand for other materials. PTFE gets its fluorine {{without the need for}} fluorine gas: chloroform (trichloromethane) is treated with HF to make <b>chlorodifluoromethane</b> (R-22, an HFC); this chemical when heated makes tetrafluoroethylene (abbreviated TFE), the starting point for PTFE.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Chlorodifluoromethane</b> or {{difluoromonochloromethane}} is a hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC). This colorless gas {{is better}} known as HCFC-22, or R-22. It is commonly used as a propellant and refrigerant. These applications are being phased out in developed countries due to the compound's ozone depletion potential (ODP) and high global warming potential (GWP), although global use of R-22 continues to increase because of high demand in developing countries. [...] R-22 is a versatile intermediate in industrial organofluorine chemistry, e.g. as a precursor to tetrafluoroethylene. R-22 cylinders are colored light green.|$|E
50|$|The first {{air conditioners}} and {{refrigerators}} employed toxic or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, {{that could result}} in fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon, in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as <b>chlorodifluoromethane</b> (R-22).|$|E

5000|$|Freon ( [...] ) is a {{registered}} trademark of The Chemours Company, which uses it {{for a number of}} halocarbon products. They are stable, nonflammable, moderately toxic gases or liquids which have typically been used as refrigerants and as aerosol propellants. These include the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that cause ozone depletion (such as <b>chlorodifluoromethane),</b> an HCFC. Newer refrigerants which typically include fluorine instead of chlorine deplete other areas of the ozone layer. Not all refrigerants of this type are labelled as [...] "Freon" [...] since Freon is a brand name for the refrigerants R-12, R-13B1, R-22, R-502, and R-503 manufactured by The Chemours Company. The term [...] "freon" [...] is a common descriptor or proprietary eponym like [...] "coke," [...] "xerox," [...] or [...] "kleenex."

50|$|The fluids used {{in closed}} loops may be {{designed}} to be biodegradable and non-toxic, but the refrigerant used in the heat pump cabinet and in direct exchange loops was, until recently, <b>chlorodifluoromethane,</b> which is an ozone depleting substance. Although harmless while contained, leaks and improper end-of-life disposal contribute to enlarging the ozone hole. For new construction, this refrigerant is being phased {{out in favor of}} the ozone-friendly but potent greenhouse gas R410A. The EcoCute water heater is an air-source heat pump that uses carbon dioxide as its working fluid instead of chlorofluorocarbons. Open loop systems (i.e. those that draw ground water as opposed to closed loop systems using a borehole heat exchanger) need to be balanced by reinjecting the spent water. This prevents aquifer depletion and the contamination of soil or surface water with brine or other compounds from underground.|$|E
