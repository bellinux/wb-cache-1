5|$|A <b>community</b> <b>may</b> {{incorporate}} as a town if {{its population}} {{is greater than}} 2,500 and {{the outcome of a}} vote involving affected residents was that greater than 50% voted in favour of the proposed incorporation. British Columbia has 14 towns. The former Town of Fort Nelson amalgamated with the Northern Rockies Regional District on February 6, 2009 to form the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality.|$|E
5|$|Under current legislation, a <b>community</b> <b>may</b> {{incorporate}} {{as a city}} if {{its population}} is greater than 5,000 and {{the outcome of a}} vote involving affected residents was that greater than 50% voted in favour of the proposed incorporation. British Columbia has 50 cities. Greenwood incorporated as a city in 1897 prior to the current legislation and retains this status despite its population of 708 being less than the current 5,000 threshold. Six other cities also have populations less than 5,000yet retain their status.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{providing}} locomotion {{opportunities for}} winged animals and {{a conduit for}} the dispersal of pollen grains, spores and seeds, the atmosphere can {{be considered to be}} a habitat in its own right. There are metabolically active microbes present that actively reproduce and spend their whole existence airborne, with hundreds of thousands of individual organisms estimated to be present in a cubic metre of air. The airborne microbial <b>community</b> <b>may</b> be as diverse as that found in soil or other terrestrial environments, however these organisms are not evenly distributed, their densities varying spatially with altitude and environmental conditions. Aerobiology has been little studied, but there is evidence of nitrogen fixation in clouds, and less clear evidence of carbon cycling, both facilitated by microbial activity.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{children}} from differing <b>communities</b> <b>may</b> treat their toys {{in different ways}} based on their cultural practices. Children in more affluent <b>communities</b> <b>may</b> tend to be possessive of their toys, while {{children from}} poorer <b>communities</b> <b>may</b> {{be more willing to}} share and interact more with other children. The importance the child places on possession is dictated by the values in place within the community that the children observe on a daily basis.|$|R

5|$|Farm Fields, a {{site near}} Kinloch, {{provides}} some of the earliest known evidence of human occupation in Scotland. Carbonized hazelnut shells found there have been dated to the Mesolithic period at 7700-7500 BC.; at this time the landscape was dominated by alder, hazel and willow scrub. A beach site above Loch Scresort has been dated to between 6500 and 5500 BC. The presence of this hunter-gatherer <b>community</b> <b>may</b> have been {{to take advantage of the}} local supplies of bloodstone, a workable material for the making of tools and weapons. There is a shell-midden at Papadil in the south and evidence of tidal fish traps at both Kinloch and Kilmory.|$|E

5000|$|Types {{of online}} {{learning}} communities include e-learning communities (groups interact and connect solely via technology) and blended learning communities (groups utilize face-to-face meetings {{as well as}} online meetings). Based on Riel and Polin (2004), intentional online learning <b>communities</b> <b>may</b> be categorized as knowledge-based, practice-based, and task-based. Online learning <b>communities</b> <b>may</b> focus on personal aspects, process, or technology. They may use technology and tools in many categories: ...|$|R

25|$|Amish {{lifestyle}} is {{regulated by the}} Ordnung (German, meaning: order), which differs slightly from community to community, and, within a community, from district to district. What is acceptable in one <b>community</b> <b>may</b> not be acceptable in another.|$|E
25|$|An {{individual}} <b>community</b> <b>may</b> identify {{itself by}} many names, {{each of which}} can have alternate English spellings. The largest Aboriginal communities – the Pitjantjatjara, the Arrernte, the Luritja and the Warlpiri – are all from Central Australia.|$|E

25|$|With the {{institutionalisation}} of visa-free travel between ASEAN member states, intra-ASEAN travel has boomed, a {{sign that}} endeavours to form an ASEAN <b>community</b> <b>may</b> bear fruit in years to come. In 2010, 47% or 34 million out of 73 million tourists in ASEAN member-states were from other ASEAN countries.|$|E
25|$|Known {{members of}} the <b>community</b> <b>may</b> be accused as witches, or the witches may be {{perceived}} as supernatural, non-human entities. In early modern Europe and Britain such accusations led to the executions {{of tens of thousands of}} people, who were seen to be in league with Satan. Those accused of being satanic witches were often practitioners of (usually benign) folk magic.|$|E
25|$|Men in the Haredi <b>community</b> <b>may</b> {{choose to}} defer service while {{enrolled}} in yeshivot (see Tal committee); many avoid conscription altogether. This special arrangement is called Torato Omanuto, and {{has given rise}} to tensions between the Israeli religious and secular communities. While options exist for Haredim to serve in the IDF in an atmosphere accommodating to their religious convictions, most Haredim do not choose to serve in the IDF.|$|E

25|$|The {{adjective}} indigenous {{is derived}} from the Latin word indigena, which is based on the root gen- 'to be born' with an archaic form of the prefix in 'in'. Any given people, ethnic group or <b>community</b> <b>may</b> be described as indigenous in reference to some particular region or location that they see as their traditional tribal land claim. Other terms used to refer to indigenous populations are aboriginal, native, original, or first (as in Canada's First Nations).|$|E
25|$|Among the Dead Sea Scrolls, {{a number}} of Aramaic fragments, found in cave 2, discuss eschatological {{connections}} to the eating of shewbread, which Matthew Black links with the sacred community meal discussed in a scroll from cave 1 (1QSVI), and the Messianic meal discussed in another scroll in the same cave (1QSall); Professor Black suggests that the Qumran <b>community</b> <b>may</b> have considered their regular bread sharing to be an enactment of the Sabbath division of shewbread at the Jerusalem Temple.|$|E
25|$|Studies of {{a speech}} {{community}} that presuppose the existence of that <b>community</b> <b>may</b> reproduce stereotypes that fail to accurately depict the social reality of variance among subgroups within a community and overlapping identities for individuals. Furthermore, studies of gay male language use often look at middle class European Americans who are out as gay {{to the exclusion of}} other subgroups of the LGBTQ community, and hence may draw misleading conclusions about the community as a whole.|$|E

25|$|As {{with any}} spoken language, sign {{languages}} are also vulnerable to becoming endangered. For example, a sign language {{used by a}} small <b>community</b> <b>may</b> be endangered and even abandoned as users shift to a sign language used by a larger community, as has happened with Hawai'i Sign Language, which is almost extinct {{except for a few}} elderly signers. Even national sign languages can be endangered; for example, New Zealand Sign Language is losing users. Methods are being developed to assess the language vitality of sign languages.|$|E
25|$|French Huguenots, {{who were}} Protestant, were also {{encouraged}} {{to settle in}} Ireland; they had been expelled from France after the Crown's revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Many of the Frenchmen were former soldiers, who had fought on the Williamite side in the Williamite war in Ireland. This community settled mainly in Dublin, as some had already been established as merchants in London. Their communal graveyard can still be seen off St Stephen's Green. The total population of this <b>community</b> <b>may</b> have reached 10,000.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these regularly scheduled meetings, additional meetings are frequently held at the meetinghouse. Auxiliary officers may conduct leadership meetings or host training sessions and classes. The ward or branch <b>community</b> <b>may</b> schedule social activities at the meetinghouse, including dances, dinners, holiday parties and musical presentations. The church's Young Men and Young Women organizations meet at the meetinghouse once a week, where the youth participate in activities and work on Duty to God, Scouting, or Personal Progress. Other popular activities are basketball, family history conferences, youth and singles conferences, dances, and various personal improvement classes. Church members may also reserve meetinghouses at no cost for weddings, receptions, and funerals.|$|E
2500|$|Settlements {{that provide}} a dense road network {{consisting}} of interconnected streets will tend to be viable utility cycling environments. In contrast, other <b>communities</b> <b>may</b> use a cul-de-sac based, housing estate/housing subdivision model where minor roads are disconnected and only feed into a street hierarchy of progressively more [...] "arterial" [...] type roads. Such <b>communities</b> <b>may</b> discourage cycling by imposing unnecessary detours and forcing all cyclists onto arterial roads, which {{may be perceived as}} busy and dangerous, for all trips regardless of destination or purpose.|$|R
