After receiving word of the accident from Met Ed, the NRC had activated its emergency response headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland and sent staff members to Three Mile Island. NRC chairman Joseph Hendrie and commissioner Victor Gilinsky initially viewed the accident, in the words of NRC historian Samuel Walker, as a [...] "cause for concern but not alarm". Gilinsky briefed reporters and members of Congress on the situation and informed White House staff, and at 10:00a.m. met with two other commissioners. However, the NRC faced the same problems in obtaining accurate information as the state, and was further hampered by being organizationally ill-prepared to deal with emergencies, as it lacked a <b>clear</b> <b>command</b> structure and the authority to tell the utility what to do, or to order an evacuation of the local area.|$|E

The whigs were disaffected about it, the radicals doubted it, the tories thought that property as a principle was ruined by it, the Irishmen, when the humour seized them, bade him send the bill to line trunks. Mr. Gladstone, as one observer truly says, “faced difficulties such as no other bill of this country has ever encountered, difficulties of politics and difficulties of law, difficulties of principle and difficulties of detail, difficulties of party and difficulties of personnel, difficulties of race and difficulties of class, and he has never once failed, or even seemed to fail, in his <b>clear</b> <b>command</b> of the question, in his dignity and authority of demeanour, in his impartiality in accepting amending suggestions, in his firmness in resisting destructive suggestions, in his clear perception of his aim, and his strong grasp of the fitting means.

The floor matrons did what they could to exercise authority, one or two were former department manageresses, two were ex-elementary teachers, crowded out by younger and more certificated rivals, one, and the most trustworthy one, Mrs. Pembrose found, was an ex-wardress from Holloway.

"May 2011 "Many children with autism display externalizing behavior due to challenges they face in the areas of communication, social skills and repetitive behavior or restricted interests. Parents have reported {{that it is difficult to}} know how to address these behaviors. Parent training programs have been found to increase parents' skills and decrease child externalizing behavior. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the core content of The Incredible Years parent training program with and without Visual Performance Feedback in: a) increasing parent skills and b) decreasing child externalizing behavior. The secondary purpose was to assess the extent to which parents found the interventions socially valid. Using a multiple baseline design across parent-child dyads, data were collected on parent behaviors (use of <b>clear</b> <b>commands,</b> praise and descriptive play statements) and child behaviors (compliance, prompted compliance, on-task/appropriate behavior and externalizing behaviors). Phases included baseline, parent training and feedback. Results indicated that when the parent variables of <b>clear</b> <b>commands,</b> praise and descriptive play statements were combined, all parents made mild increases in their use of those skills during each phase. However, there was variability in specific variables across parents and phases. On the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory, all parents reported decreases in child externalizing behavior from pre to post intervention. However, there was variability in specific variables across children and phases. Interpretation of these results is provided along with study limitations and future directions for research...|$|R

Vikram Sood, the former head of India's foreign intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), wrote an article on Rediff.com citing examples of how terrorist attacks occurred in India soon after peace talks took place between India and Pakistan. Firstpost published an article on similar lines highlighting past attacks and how they adversely affected India-Pakistan relations. Research conducted by GreatGameIndia Magazine revealed that the Pathankot attack was related to the international drug mafia stretching from Afghanistan via Pakistan to India from where the drugs are shipped off to Dubai and Europe.|$|E
