5|$|As {{one area}} in which OPEC members {{have been able to}} {{cooperate}} productively over the decades, the organization has significantly improved {{the quality and quantity of}} information available about the international oil market. This is especially helpful for a natural-resource industry whose smooth functioning requires months and years of <b>careful</b> <b>planning.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ballistics was {{the first}} game {{developed}} at Grin. <b>Careful</b> <b>planning</b> and production methods enabled a very quick completion time of 6 months; the game was finished before even acquiring a distribution partner. Grin used TQM methods to ensure a high standard of work, and JIT techniques to ensure the timing of different production phases came together.|$|E
5|$|At Ostend, Vindictive did prevent larger {{warships}} {{passing through}} the channel, although smaller craft could still come and go at will. The larger warships in Bruges were trapped there for the remaining months of the war; the town was captured by the Allies in October 1918. The blockages at Ostend and Zeebrugge took several years to clear completely, not being totally removed until 1921. On a strategic scale {{the effects of the}} raids at Ostend and Zeebrugge on the battle of the Atlantic were negligible. Despite this, in Britain the Ostend Raid was feted as a success. Three Victoria Crosses and a host of lesser awards were given to the men involved. The Admiralty presented it as a fine example of daring and <b>careful</b> <b>planning</b> from the Royal Navy, providing a valuable morale boost at {{one of the most critical}} moments of the war.|$|E
5000|$|Tennessee Williams' first {{published}} {{work is the}} 1928 short story [...] "The Vengeance of Nitocris", detailing the queen's <b>careful</b> <b>plan</b> for revenge. She makes the people who slew her brother die in a fitting way.|$|R
50|$|Developing one's empire now necessitated a <b>careful</b> <b>plan</b> {{for city}} development, {{including}} phases of rapture, in which city populations grow quickly, under relatively peaceful conditions; hence, games were almost always played in teams and typically took longer to finish {{when compared to}} 1.x games.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's possible. He has spies and the German Colonel has, no doubt, made <b>careful</b> <b>plans.</b> There are two routes; {{east and}} west of the high ground, and I reckon he'll send the cazadores up in two columns. The first will {{probably}} try to get behind the Bat's position." ...|$|R
5|$|The design {{challenges}} the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair (C) {{faced with this}} class were considerable, as the combined requirements of optimum hitting power, extreme speed and adequate protection taxed the knowledge of its naval architects and technology of the time. The desired speed of 35knots, for example, had been previously attained only in destroyers and smaller craft. To do so with a capital ship required a hull and a power plant of unprecedented size for a U.S. naval vessel, in addition to <b>careful</b> <b>planning</b> by its designers to ensure it would have enough longitudinal strength to withstand both bending forces while underway and any stress that might occur in combat. It took years between initial and final designs for engine and boiler technology to provide a plant of sufficient power that was also compact enough to allow a practical degree of protection, even in such large ships.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{supported}} the idea, believing {{it the best}} solution to an intractable problem. The bill passed, providing for a commission of five representatives, five senators, and five Supreme Court justices. To ensure partisan balance, there would be seven Democrats and seven Republicans; the fifteenth member {{was to be a}} Supreme Court justice chosen by the other four on the commission (themselves two Republicans and two Democrats). Justice David Davis, an independent respected by both parties, was expected to be their choice, but he upset the <b>careful</b> <b>planning</b> by accepting election to the Senate by the state of Illinois and refusing to serve on the commission. The remaining Supreme Court justices were all Republicans and, with the addition of Justice Joseph P. Bradley to the place intended for Davis, the commission had an 8–7 Republican majority. Randall nevertheless favored the compromise, even voting in favor of it in the roll call vote (the Speaker usually does not vote). The commission met and awarded all of the disputed ballots to Hayes by an 8–7 party-line vote.|$|E
25|$|Due to this <b>careful</b> <b>planning</b> {{this project}} was {{successful}} both in improving the socialeconomic conditions {{in the region and}} ensuring that land and water are sustainability into the future.|$|E

60|$|Tommy retired for {{the night}} in a state of some elation. He had {{elaborated}} a <b>careful</b> <b>plan</b> for the following evening. He felt sure that the inhabitants of Astley Priors would not interfere with him up to a certain point. It was after that that Tommy proposed to give them a surprise.|$|R
60|$|Diana {{had been}} making <b>careful</b> <b>plans</b> for her {{interview}} with Arthur that Sunday afternoon. With no futile attempt to deceive herself as to existent conditions she coldly weighed the chances in her mental scale and concluded she had sufficient power to win this unstable youth to her side and induce him to forget that such a person as Louise Merrick ever existed.|$|R
25|$|In December 2011, a new {{commercial}} market opened in Bosaso's northern Dayaha ("Star") neighborhood, near the seaport. Approximately half a kilometer in size, {{it was designed}} to ensure easy vehicle access. The market is the result of <b>careful</b> <b>planning</b> between Puntland government officials and civil society representatives.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{half-life}} of fluorine-18 {{is about}} two hours, the prepared dose of a radiopharmaceutical bearing this radionuclide will undergo multiple half-lives of decay during the working day. This necessitates frequent recalibration of the remaining dose (determination of activity per unit volume) and <b>careful</b> <b>planning</b> with respect to patient scheduling.|$|E
25|$|Usually, {{good results}} would be {{expected}} from plastic surgery that emphasize <b>careful</b> <b>planning</b> of incisions so that they fall within the line of natural skin folds or lines, appropriate choice of wound closure, use of best available suture materials, and early removal of exposed sutures so that the wound is held closed by buried sutures.|$|E

25|$|Restoration is {{underway}} {{in the forest}} through <b>careful</b> <b>planning,</b> cooperation from trail-users and efforts such as tree planting, invasive species removal and creating a main trail. The project's aim is that by reducing the impact of recreation in the forest, this natural area will still be around for generations to enjoy 100 years from now.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} new, highly {{specific}} and sensitive trichomoniasis tests present opportunities for new screening protocols {{for both men}} and women. <b>Careful</b> <b>planning,</b> discussion, and research are required to determine the cost-efficiency and most beneficial use of these new tests for the diagnosis and treatment of trichomoniasis in the U.S., which can lead to better prevention efforts.|$|E
25|$|Abstract {{expressionism}} {{has many}} stylistic similarities to the Russian {{artists of the}} early twentieth century such as Wassily Kandinsky. Although it is true that spontaneity or of the impression of spontaneity characterized many of the abstract expressionists works, most of these paintings involved <b>careful</b> <b>planning,</b> especially since their large size demanded it. An exception might be the drip paintings of Pollock.|$|E
50|$|As Drake gets {{involved}} in a case, things are rarely as they seem. He is not infallible — he gets arrested, he makes mistakes, equipment fails, <b>careful</b> <b>plans</b> do not work; Drake often has to improvise an alternative plan. Sometimes investigation fails and he simply does something provocative to crack open the case. People he trusts can {{turn out to be}} untrustworthy or incompetent; he finds unexpected allies.|$|R
50|$|Since he is {{motivated}} by adherence to orthodoxy, the ideological killer typically seeks notoriety for his cause through carnage. While the active shooter too seeks notoriety, and while he too maps a <b>careful</b> <b>plan</b> of the event, there is a crucial difference in the pursuit. The ideological killer generally means to elude capture, to live beyond the event (as does the serial killer). The active shooter merges his identity with the event and sees nothing beyond.|$|R
5000|$|Janchan enters Ardha and obtains {{employment}} as a soldier. In this employ, he finds Niamh (who was recaptured by Siona's band after her escape attempt and then given to Arjala the [...] "goddess" [...] of Ardha as captive—due to rivalry between Arjala and Akhmim, this allowed some power-josting). Soldiers in Arjala's employ have also captured Zarqa and display {{him as an}} amphasand, a mythical creature sacred to the Laonese. Janchan makes <b>careful</b> <b>plans</b> to rescue Niamh and Zarqa.|$|R
25|$|All {{military}} campaigns were {{preceded by}} <b>careful</b> <b>planning,</b> reconnaissance, and gathering sensitive {{information relating to}} enemy territories and forces. The success, organization, and mobility of the Mongol armies permitted them to fight on several fronts at once. All adult males up {{to the age of}} 60 were eligible for conscription into the army, a source of honor in their tribal warrior tradition.|$|E
25|$|On November 8, 1971, Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, {{arrived in}} Vietnam and {{personally}} approved {{a request from}} Lavelle to attack the MiG airfield at Đồng Hới. Moorer even reviewed the bomb damage assessment results that day, before departing Vietnam. Mission results also went to the Pentagon. Instead of questioning the mission, the JCS only suggested more <b>careful</b> <b>planning.</b>|$|E
25|$|Though {{the roots}} of the town's economy were in iron, steel and pipe clay, {{planners}} touted it as a health resort, and several hotels began operating. Schools also appeared, including the Noble Institute, a school for girls established in 1886, and the Alabama Presbyterian College for Men, founded in 1905. <b>Careful</b> <b>planning</b> and easy access to rail transportation helped make Anniston the fifth largest city in the state from the 1890s to the 1950s.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is," [...] assented Mr. Barclay, {{refilling}} his pipe. [...] "The {{trouble is}} that it makes a certain amount of commotion, and when silence is important {{you have to be careful}} how you set it to work. As a rule, it's wiser to have everything ready first. The most <b>careful</b> <b>plans</b> fail sometimes if your assistants are more keen than judicious. That"--and he smiled at the boys--"is why I was dubious about taking you into my confidence before." ...|$|R

5000|$|Equine SCID is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder {{that affects the}} Arabian horse. Similar to the [...] "bubble boy" [...] condition in humans, an affected foal is born with no immune system, and thus generally dies of an opportunistic infection, usually within the first {{four to six months}} of life. There is a DNA test that can detect healthy horses who are carriers of the gene causing SCID, thus testing and <b>careful,</b> <b>planned</b> matings can now eliminate the possibility of an affected foal ever being born.|$|R
25|$|The <b>careful</b> <b>planning</b> {{and zoning}} within Reston allows for common grounds, several parks, large swaths of wooded areas with picturesque runs (streams), wildflower meadows, two golf courses, nearly 20 public {{swimming}} pools, bridle paths, a bike path, four lakes, tennis courts, and extensive foot pathways. These pathways, combined with bridges and tunnels, help to separate pedestrians from vehicular traffic and increase safety at certain street crossings. Reston {{was built in}} wooded areas of oak, maple, sycamore, and Virginia pine.|$|E
25|$|Depending on {{the extent}} of {{sustainability}} design, the costs of green building often imply an initial capital cost premium compared to the cost of conventional buildings. Newer technology and the requirement of special labor skills are examples of cost drivers in green building projects. However, <b>careful</b> <b>planning</b> and deliberate choices can minimize these upfront costs. It is expected that the costs of building green will decrease over time, thanks to experience and the development of products and services.|$|E
25|$|Low {{conscientiousness}} {{has been}} linked to antisocial and criminal behaviors, as well as unemployment, homelessness, and imprisonment. Low conscientiousness and low agreeableness taken together are also associated with substance abuse. People low in conscientiousness have difficulty saving money and have different borrowing practices than conscientious people. High conscientiousness is associated with more <b>careful</b> <b>planning</b> of shopping trips and less impulse buying of unneeded items. Conscientiousness {{has been found to be}} positively correlated with business white collar crime.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{intensive}} searches ever mounted in Scotland failed to find a trace of them. It was concluded {{that they had been}} murdered, that the murderer had made <b>careful</b> <b>plans</b> and had disposed of the bodies without leaving any clues. Witnesses on the A9 reported seeing a man dragging something they thought was a dead sheep not far from the car, while others saw a man with a pushchair near the quarry. MacRae was reported to have been wearing a sheepskin coat when she disappeared.|$|R
500|$|Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID). Recessive disorder, fatal when homozygous, {{carriers}} (heterozygotes) show no signs. Similar to the [...] "bubble boy" [...] {{condition in}} humans, an affected foal is {{born with a}} complete lack of an immune system, and thus generally dies of an opportunistic infection, usually {{before the age of}} three months. There is a DNA test that can detect healthy horses who are carriers of the gene causing SCID, thus testing and <b>careful,</b> <b>planned</b> matings can now eliminate the possibility of an affected foal ever being born.|$|R
50|$|Despite their <b>careful</b> <b>plans,</b> Orsini is {{recognized}} by Angela Borgia and the Cardinal d'Este while recruiting Swiss mercenaries and Pierre de Bayard. They reveal the plot to Borgia's captain, and spying on Orsini's interview with Camilla in the madhouse, discover {{how to stop}} the plot. Having suspected them, Orsini reveals that they have actually set the attack in motion. Peter and the Swiss gain the walls as the city rises in revolt. Camilla gives the Catalan prefect to the people to avenge themselves upon, and Angela and d'Este are sent away.|$|R
