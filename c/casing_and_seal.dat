40|$|Special Paperpg. 133 In the {{commonly}} mostly employed, so-called, ?wet technique? for the desulphurization of flue gas, stringent demands {{are being made}} on the materials of the pumps to minimize wear by corrosion and abrasion and to reach the longest possible service lives for the pumps. For various metallic corrosion resistant materials from several different suppliers, extensive laboratory investigations have been carried out, testing them in a ?grinding pot,? thereby studying the corrosion and abrasion behavior at different flow velocities. Coated materials and welding materials were also tested; various parts were examined for crevice corrosion. It can be concluded that only certain duplex materials show a sufficient corrosion resistance, depending on the pH-value and chloride content of the flue gas desulphurization suspension, and on certain alloying elements and the heat treatment the materials received. A presentation of the design executions for an optimum design of pumps in flue gas desulphurization plants is offered. The principal elements of a centrifugal pump, such as impeller, <b>casing,</b> <b>and</b> shaft <b>sealing</b> with a packed stuffing box <b>and</b> mechanical <b>seal</b> are addressed...|$|R
30|$|A {{variety of}} other {{datasets}} {{can be used as}} a proxy for the favorability of each stratigraphic unit to host fracture permeability and fluid flow. Pressure–temperature-spinner logs, for example, may reveal discrete flowing intervals in wells correlated to specific faults or lithologic intervals in the 3 D geologic map. This type of information may also be available on mud logs or well completion reports. Well construction reports (detailing depth of the casing ‘shoe,’ above which the well has been cemented with steel <b>casing</b> <b>and</b> therefore <b>sealed</b> off from the formation) can also provide information relevant to which lithologic intervals tend to host permeability intervals. In a productive geothermal field, intervals along production or injection wells that are cased with slotted liners, otherwise open to fluid flow, and/or correspond with fault zones can be interpreted within lithologies favorable for hosting permeability and fluid flow. If flowing intervals are not faulted, geothermal fluids may reside with primary stratigraphic permeability that is charged with upwelling fluids from nearby faults (Siler et al. 2016 a).|$|R

The mechanical construction of the meter differs from those previously described in that it minimises problems with pressure <b>casing</b> penetrations <b>and</b> with <b>sealing</b> of connecting leads. A condensed theoretical analysis of the behaviour of the meter in air-water mixtures is included, together {{with a discussion of}} possible errors due to changes in conductivity of water and excitation frequency. Two different systems on electronics are described, a series and a bridge type system.

40|$|Although rotary engines can {{potentially}} {{be used as}} hydrogen fuel engines, the contact condition between the <b>casing</b> <b>and</b> the apex <b>seal</b> on the triangular rotor impacts sealing performance, which then directly affects leakage problems. In this paper, therefore, a rotary engine’s internal gas flow characteristics are investigated by using the CFD package FLUENT to construct a fluid analysis model. For comparative convenience, assuming that the simulated gas is air, and then, using a set circular radius outside the casing, analyze three different cases with various geometric design parameters (the K factor) and their effects on the internal pressure, streamlining, and leakage. The {{results indicate that the}} K factor design produces different rotor profiles with different working chamber volumes: the lower the K factor, the larger the working chamber volume. Nevertheless, although this design can improve the combustion and compression efficiencies, it may lead to increased internal pressure variation and raised pressure. In addition, when the clearance is small, it may result in a larger leakage problem, negatively affecting rotary engine performance...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the effect of ‘prekese’ (Tetrapleura tetraptera) seed powder (PSP) on the sensory characteristics and nutritional qualities of smoke pork sausage. A total of 4 kg of minced pork was used. The pork was divided into four equal parts (1 kg per treatment). Each treatment contain the following: (T 1) control (without PSP), (T 2) with 3 g of PSP, (T 3) with 4 g of PSP and (T 4) with 5 g of PSP. The sausages were stuffed into <b>casing</b> <b>and</b> vacuum <b>sealed</b> in transparent polythene bags and refrigerated at 2 oC for laboratory and sensory analysis. The sensory analysis was conducted {{to determine the effect}} of ‘prekese’ seed powder on the sensory characteristics of the product.

40|$|LecturePg. 95 - 110 A {{case study}} of a remanufacture of a steam turbine is presented. The turbine has been in service for 20 years. Thermal and {{physical}} stresses have taken their toll on the turbine <b>casing</b> <b>and</b> supporting hardware. Remanufacture was planned with innovative processes and state-of-the-art component upgrades. A unique heat treatment process was designed to reshape the <b>casing</b> <b>and</b> relieve residual stresses thermally induced into the casing over its operating life. Using heat to reshape the case minimized the amount of remachining time required.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Shear {{strength}} tests are {{conducted in a}} model of a water well on four, commercially available, granular bentonite well sealing products. The time depen-dency of annulus <b>seal</b> shear strength <b>and</b> resistance to piping is examined. Dry bentonite samples are placed through water in the annular space between the <b>casing</b> <b>and</b> borehole and allowed to set for a specified time. Pressure is applied at a con-stant rate to one end of the clay seal until shear or piping failure occurs. Pressure <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> displacement data are recorded on a digital data acquisition system. An-nulus <b>seal</b> strength <b>and</b> resistance to piping increase with setting time. Ultimate shear strength is reached in 72 to 120 hours after placement. Differences between this laboratory scale study and field scale applications are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This investigative program {{examines}} {{leakage testing}} of elastomeric O-ring seals for a solid rocket <b>casing</b> <b>and</b> provides direction towards an improved nondestructive postassembly test. It also details test {{equipment for the}} Space Shuttle systems solid rocket boosters (SRB). The results are useful to designers of hardware for pressure containment vessels which use O-ring seals. Using several subscale <b>seal</b> <b>and</b> groove configuration test fixtures equipped with either two or three O-ring seals in series, seal integrity is investigated with both a pressure decay and flowmeter methods. Both types of test equipment adequately detect the practical range of expected seal leak rates of 1 to 0. 0001 sccs. The flowmeter leak test equipment appears to reduce testing time substantially. Limited seal leakage testing is performed on full-sized rocket motor segment seals, a pre-Challenger short stack, providing comparison of bore seals to test specimen bore <b>and</b> face <b>seals.</b> The conclusions are that seal reliability, verified via a performance pressure test, can be affected by temperature, quantity of grease, test pressure, <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> pressure load direction. Potential seal failure scenarios including contamination, <b>seal</b> damage, <b>and</b> <b>sealing</b> surface damage are discussed. Recommendations are made for an improved test procedure...|$|R
40|$|Two {{basically}} different concepts {{for disposal}} of highly radioactive waste are the often cited KBS- 3 method and a concept termed VDH (Very Deep Boreholes). So far, the deep hole concept has been ranked as number two because the canisters are not {{assumed to be}} retrievable and {{because some of the}} techniques for installation of the waste are not yet at hand. Reconsideration of the design and function of VDH shows that, in addition to the advantage of no transport of released radionuclides by groundwater flow up to the ground level because of the almost stagnant salt groundwater at depth, the rock at depth is considerably less permeable than for mined repositories at shallow depth. A further advantage is that VDH will be less affected by future glaciations. Less good is that precise adaption of canister <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> positions to the rock structure cannot be made until boring of the deep holes is complete. Furthermore, the deep holes need to be supported by <b>casings</b> <b>and</b> all work deeper than 500 m must be made with mud in them.

The {{study on}} tension {{behavior}} of <b>casing</b> <b>and</b> dowel joint of square steel tube {{was carried out}} by using finite element analysis software ANSYS/LS-DYNA with consideration of geometric nonlinearity, material nonlinearity and contact nonlinearity. On this basis, the effects of inside tube wall thickness, main tube wall thickness, and inserting depth on failure mode, ultimate tensile load <b>and</b> deformation of <b>casing</b> <b>and</b> dowel joint of square steel tube was discussed. The results show that there are three types of failure modes, i. e., bolt failure, inside tube failure and main tube failure, when the joints are subjected to axial tension force. Compare to the joint with the same wall thickness of inside tube and main tube, the reduction of wall thickness of inside tube or main tube will weaken greatly the ultimate tensile load of the joint. The ultimate tensile load of <b>casing</b> <b>and</b> dowel joints is proportional to bolt shear strength, tube wall thickness, inserting depth, and tube edge length.
