5|$|Although {{they had}} {{considered}} several story ideas, Heuton and Falacci wanted to feature a <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> math {{was used to}} solve a traditional type of crime. They decided to base the episode on a real-life serial rapist <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> police asked Dr. Kim Rossmo {{to assist them in}} the investigation. In 1998, Rossmo, then with the Vancouver Police Department, was called in to help Lafayette, Louisiana, police investigator McCullan Gallien find the South Side Rapist. Rossmo and Gallien visited the crime scenes, and Rossmo used criminal geographic targeting, a mathematical model used to find the area in which the suspect would most likely reside. Together, Rossmo and Gallien developed a map indicating the most likely location of the rapist's residence. After DNA cleared everyone living in the area, Gallien learned that a sheriff's deputy in a neighboring department, Randy Comeaux, was a potential suspect. He had lived in the area during the time frame of the rapes but moved to a residence in the neighboring jurisdiction some time later. DNA on a cigarette butt left by Comeaux confirmed that he was the rapist, and Comeaux was arrested.|$|E
