5|$|The {{economic}} impact of the common cold is not well understood in much of the world. In the United States, the common cold leads to 75–100 million physician visits annually at a conservative cost estimate of $7.7 billion per year. Americans spend $2.9 billion on over-the-counter drugs and another $400 million on prescription medicines for symptom relief. More than one-third of people who saw a doctor received an antibiotic prescription, which has implications for antibiotic resistance. An estimated 22–189 million school days are missed annually due to a cold. As a result, parents missed 126 million workdays to stay home to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> When added to the 150 million workdays missed by employees suffering from a cold, the total {{economic impact}} of cold-related work loss exceeds $20 billion per year. This accounts for 40% of time lost from work in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Treating genetic {{problems}} is {{the mission of}} Clinic for Special Children in Strasburg, Pennsylvania, which has developed effective treatments for such problems as maple syrup urine disease, a previously fatal disease. The clinic is embraced by most Amish, ending the need for parents to leave the community to receive proper <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> an action that might result in shunning. Another clinic is DDC Clinic for Special Needs Children, located in Middlefield, Ohio, for special-needs children with inherited or metabolic disorders. The DDC Clinic provides treatment, research, and educational services to Amish and non-Amish children and their families.|$|E
25|$|As Nilsen progressed into adolescence, {{he found}} life in Strichen {{increasingly}} stifling, with limited entertainment amenities or career opportunities. Although he respected his parents' {{efforts to provide}} and <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> he began to resent {{the fact that his}} family was poorer than most of his peers, with his mother and stepfather making no effort to better their lifestyles; thus, Nilsen seldom invited his few friends to the family home. At the age of 14, he joined the Army Cadet Force, and later recalled his viewing the British Army as a potential avenue for escaping his rural origins.|$|E
25|$|Vaccination offers {{ethical issues}} beyond the normal issues {{of a parent}} {{deciding}} on medical <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> as unvaccinated individuals may spread disease to people (especially children and the elderly) with weaker immune systems, and to individuals in whom the vaccine has not been effective. For this reason, even where not required by law some schools and doctors' surgeries have prohibited parents with unvaccinated children from enrolling. A further complication arises in emergency room and urgent care facilities, particularly those geared towards treating children as an unvaccinated child is often brought to these facilities after acquiring the disease and showing symptoms. Other children {{that are in the}} facility with compromised immune systems are then exposed. Mandatory vaccination also raises ethical issues regarding parental rights and informed consent.|$|E

500|$|There {{were three}} broad criticisms {{aimed at the}} idea of {{maternal}} deprivation from feminist critics. The first was that Bowlby overstated his case. The studies on which he based his conclusions involved almost complete lack of maternal care and it was unwarranted to generalise from this view that any separation in {{the first three years of}} life would be damaging. Subsequent research showed good quality care for part of the day to be harmless. The idea of exclusive care or exclusive attachment to a preferred figure, rather than a hierarchy (subsequently thought to be the case within developments of attachment theory) had not been borne out by research and this view placed too high an emotional burden on the mother. Secondly, they criticised Bowlby's historical perspective and saw his views as part of the idealisation of motherhood and family life after World War II. Certainly his hypothesis was used by governments to close down much needed residential nurseries although governments did not seem so keen to pay mothers to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> at home as advocated by Bowlby. Thirdly, feminists objected to the idea of anatomy as destiny and concepts of [...] "naturalness" [...] derived from ethnocentric observations. They argued that anthropology showed that it is normal for childcare to be shared by a stable group of adults of which maternal care is an important but not exclusive part.|$|E

His mother, Florence Hannah Dirac, [...] Holten, the daughter of a ship's captain, was born in Cornwall, England, and worked as a librarian at the Bristol Central Library. Paul had a younger sister, Béatrice Isabelle Marguerite, known as Betty, and an older brother, Reginald Charles Félix, known as Felix, who committed suicide in March 1925. Dirac later recalled: [...] "My parents were terribly distressed.

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{the perceptions of}} parents of children who died from cancer regarding the palliative and supportive care they received in hospital and in community settings. Method: Face-to-face or telephone questionnaires. Setting Tertiary paediatric oncology centres in Western Australia, New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria. Participants: 69 parents. Results: Parents indicated the need for clear and honest information about <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> condition and prognosis throughout the trajectory of illness. Parents also required access to, and advice from, multidisciplinary health professionals when <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> at home. Parents preferred to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> at home wherever possible throughout the palliative care trajectory of <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> cancer and were well supported by immediate and extended family and friends. However, many families were affected emotionally and financially by the burden of <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> with incurable cancer. Families required financial and practical assistance with providing care from <b>their</b> <b>child.</b> Parents wanted and needed more practical resources and information {{to assist with the}} management of <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> nutrition and pain, {{as well as for the}} support of <b>their</b> other <b>children.</b> Conclusion: <b>Care</b> <b>for</b> <b>children</b> and <b>their</b> families should be coordinated by a multidisciplinary team in consultation with <b>children</b> and <b>their</b> families, and should be linked and integrated with the treating hospital in collaboration with community services...|$|R

2500|$|Involuntary Servitude/Michigan: On May 31, 2007, {{a couple}} from Cameroon was sentenced for {{involuntary}} servitude and related charges. Joseph Djoumessi, 49, {{was found guilty}} of conspiracy, involuntary servitude and harboring for financial gain. He was sentenced to 17 years in prison, to run concurrent with a 9-to-15-year sentence he is currently serving for a Michigan state conviction related to the same crime. A jury also convicted Djoumessi's wife, Evelyn Djoumessi, 42, of conspiracy and involuntary servitude. She was sentenced to five years in prison. The couple was also ordered to pay $100,000 in restitution to the victim. ICE agents in Detroit began an investigation in 2000 after receiving information regarding a young girl who was possibly being held against her will. A 17-year-old girl from Cameroon was discovered in the Djoumessi home, living under a false identity and in questionable circumstances. The girl had been brought into the United States illegally when she was 14 years old. During the time the girl lived at the couple's home, she was forced [...] "by beating and threats," [...] according to court documents, to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> and perform household chores without pay. They also limited her {{contact with the outside world}} and did not permit her to attend school.|$|E

In 1985, {{when looking at the}} trendline that showed that half of all pre-school children had mothers in the workforce, she assured Reagan that once the economy picked up [...] "all those women can go home and look after their own children". [...] As a long-time working mother herself, Whittlesey asserted this statement was taken out of context and did not reflect her intent of actively expanding choices, professional and personal, for women. The statement continued, [...] "They could <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> themselves if they wished to do so because their husbands would have opportunities again in a thriving economy." [...] She emphasized Reagan's pledge to create more jobs for working people. Whittlesey was the only woman on Reagan's Senior White House Staff during her service there. According to David Broder, [...] "Whittlesey asserted in 1980 her position on women's rights and her fight as a woman to be effective politically, 'I sympathize with some of the goals of the women's movement, but they choose not to associate with me, so that's where we are. [...] I find myself in many closed rooms filled with men, but I'm rarely invited to women's movement's functions, because I am pro-life and do not endorse feminist ideology of victimhood.'

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide the basic data to develop the {{effective}} nursing intervention for the parent who have children with cancer by acquiring the deeper understanding of the mothers’ adjustment of <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> with cancer. Methods: The ethnographic research method was used to find out the pattern of caring adjustment in Korean cultural context. Informants consisted of 12 mothers who were <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> with cancer. The data were collected using in-depth interviews, participant observation, and telephone interviews by maximum variation purposive sampling. The data were analyzed following Spradley’s methodology. Results: The mothers’ caring adjustment were organized into one cultural theme, four categories, and twelve properties. The cultural theme was ‘standing alone as a mother with sin’. The four categories were ‘blaming for falling illness&# 39;, ‘overcoming with motherhood&# 39;, ‘desperate struggling with side effects’, and ‘establishing new network as a dependent&# 39;. Conclusion: For the mothers who are caring children with cancer, the supportive nursing intervention based on the deeper understanding of mothers&# 39; pattern of <b>caring</b> adjustment <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> and centered on facilitating effective adjustment in each cultural context especially from the very early stage of caring in the hospital ward is extremely required...|$|R
