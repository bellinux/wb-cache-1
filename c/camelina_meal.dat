The basal diets were corn starch–based with adequate vitamins and minerals to meet the pigs’ requirements. The experimental treatments consisted of the basal diet with 30 % fermented soybean meal or 39. 25 % <b>camelina</b> <b>meal</b> as the sole protein sources. A third nitrogen-free diet was also fed to determine basal endogenous amino acid losses. For Exp. 2, to determine energy concentrations, 6 growing barrows (BW = 64. 8 lb) were randomly allotted to 1 of 3 dietary treatments in a crossover design with 3 periods. The corn-based treatment diets had 25 % fermented soybean meal or 30 % <b>camelina</b> <b>meal.</b> A third corn basal diet was also offered to allow for energy calculations by the difference method. All diets contained 0. 25 % titanium oxide as an indigestible marker. Digesta samples were collected and analyzed for amino acid concentrations, and fecal samples were collected and analyzed for energy concentrations. After chemical analysis, standardized and apparent ileal digestible (SID and AID, respectively) amino acids were determined, and DE, ME, and NE were calculated for each ingredient. On a DM basis, GE, DE, ME, and NE were 1, 973, 1, 377, 1, 232, and 880 kcal/lb, respectively, for fermented soybean meal and 2, 075, 1, 150, 1, 041, and 715 kcal/lb, respectively, for <b>camelina</b> <b>meal.</b> In fermented soybean meal, the AID for lysine, methionine, threonine, and tryptophan were 63. 5 ± 7. 5, 84. 6 ± 1. 0, 74. 0 ± 3. 5, and 81. 8 ± 1. 4 %, respectively, and SID values were 71. 1 ± 6. 2, 89. 2 ± 2. 1, 88. 0 ± 3. 1, and 93. 7 ± 2. 0 %, respectively.

Weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) of fish fed 200. g/kg SECM were significantly lower than those fed 0 and 50. g/kg SECM. The protein efficiency ratio (PER) of fish fed 50. g/kg SECM (2. 4) was significantly higher than fish fed 0, 150 and 200. g/kg SECM (all 2. 1). There were no significant differences among treatments for total feed consumption or FCR, although during earlier periods of the trial, fish fed 150 and 200. g/kg SECM had higher FCR than fish fed 0 and 50. g/kg SECM (P. 0. 05). Although there were a few negative effects on performance in fish fed 200. g/kg camelina seed and HORM early in the trial, this did not remain consistent for the entire trial. The maximum dietary inclusion threshold of these camelina products in juvenile rainbow trout diets is likely between 100 and 200. g/kg, although further research will be required to determine more definite values.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Camelina {{is a new}} {{oil crop}} in North America. <b>Camelina</b> <b>meal,</b> a {{by-product}} of the camelina oil extraction process, typically contains 10 % to 15 % residual oil and 40 % crude protein. As camelina oil demand increases, utilization of camelina protein for value-added products is critical to food and biotechnology industries; however, {{few studies have been}} conducted on camelina proteins. In this study, camelina protein fractions (albumin, globulins, and glutelins) were isolated from <b>camelina</b> <b>meal</b> based on their solubility using three different sequences: method 0 (S 0), method 1 (S 1), and method 2 (S 2). The proteins ’ physicochemical properties, including solubility, amino acid profiles, molecular weight, and thermal and morphological properties, were also characterized. Results showed that S 1 harvested more protein (88. 20 %) than S 0 (84. 05 %) and S 2 (76. 52 %). Glutelin was the major fraction (64. 64 %) in camelina, followed by globulin (17. 67 %), and albumin (10. 54 %). Essential amino acids accounted for approximately 40 % of the total amino acids in camelina pro-tein.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Three {{experiments}} compared ruminal, physiological, {{and performance}} responses of beef steers consuming hay ad libitum and receiving grain-based supplements with (CAM) or without (CO) inclusion of <b>camelina</b> <b>meal.</b> In Exp. 1, 9 steers fitted with ruminal cannulas received CAM (2. 04 kg of DM/d) or CO (2. 20 kg of DM/d). Steers receiving CAM had reduced (P = 0. 01) total DMI {{and tended to}} have reduced (P = 0. 10) forage DMI compared to CO. No treatment effects were detected (P ≥ 0. 35) for ruminal hay degradability parameters. In Exp. 2, 14 steers receiving CAM (1. 52 kg of DM/d) or CO (1. 65 kg of DM/d) were assigned to corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH; 0. 1 μg/kg of BW) and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH; 0. 33 μg/kg of BW) challenges. Steers receiving CAM had greater (P < 0. 05) serum concentrations of PUFA compared to CO prior to challenges. Upon CRH infusion, mean plasma ceruloplasmin concentrations increased at a lesser rate in CAM compared with CO (P < 0. 01). Upon TRH infusion, no treatment effects were detected (P ≥ 0. 55) for serum TSH, T₃, and T₄. In Exp. 3, 60 steers were allocated to 20 drylot pens. Pens {{were randomly assigned to}} receive CAM (2. 04 kg of DM/steer daily) or CO (2. 20 kg of DM/steer daily) during preconditioning (PC; d - 28 to 0). On the morning of d 0, steers were transported for 24 h. Upon arrival from transport on d 1, pens were randomly assigned to receive, in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement, CAM or CO during feedlot receiving (FR; d 1 to 29). During PC, CAM had reduced (P < 0. 01) forage and total DMI, and tended to have reduced (P = 0. 10) ADG compared to CO. Plasma linolenic acid concentrations increased during PC for CAM, but not for CO (P = 0. 02). Steers that received CAM during FR had greater (P < 0. 05) mean plasma concentrations of PUFA, and reduced mean rectal temperature and concentrations of haptoglobin and ceruloplasmin during FR compared to CO. Therefore, camelina supplementation reduced forage and total DMI, did not alter thyroid gland function, increased PUFA concentrations in blood, and attenuated the acute-phase protein reaction elicited by neuroendocrine stress responses.

40|$|The feed {{production}} cost in tilapia diets {{is driven by}} the prices of its ingredients such as fishmeal (FM) and soybean meal (SBM). Fishmeal and soymeal combined with other ingredients provides fish with the nutrients required for growth and sustaining life. Soybean meal is used as an alternative to fishmeal, but prices for this traditional ingredient have increased significantly in recent years as a result of high market demand from other industries. Consequently, there has been an increase interest by tilapia nutritionists and feed manufacturers to find less expensive, alternative feedstuffs for use in tilapia diets. Camelina (Camelina sativa) is an oil seed crop grown in higher latitudes especially along the US - Canada border, northern China and northern Europe. Camelina after removal of most of the edible oil has been proposed as a fish feed ingredient. A sixty-day feeding trial was conducted and diets were formulated to contain various levels of camelina inclusion (0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 %) for the "camelina meal" while the "camelina oil" was formulated to contain one level (4. 7 %) of oil and was divided as "raw" and 4. 7 "wash". The results indicated that that fishes fed diets containing camelina ingredients had growth performance and feed utilization results that were similar to fish fed the commercial diet (P> 0. 05). There were significant differences (P< 0. 05) for body organ indices and body composition. The 15 % <b>camelina</b> <b>meal</b> diet was the lowest cost experimental diet per kilogram gain and therefore, this alternative ingredient might be a potential replacement for soymeal in a more cost effective feed formulation. The fatty acid composition of tilapia fillets was also analyzed {{at the end of the}} feeding trial. The inclusion of <b>camelina</b> <b>meal</b> and oil in tilapia diets resulted in significant increases in the Omega- 3 /Omega- 6 ratio in fillets when compared to the control. The 15 % <b>camelina</b> <b>meal</b> provided the best results of the experimental diets yielding significantly higher polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and lower saturated fatty aid (SFA) than the control diet. On a commercial scale, tilapia commercial feeds differ in both formulated nutrient levels and ingredient composition. In intensive system culture, natural food is limited making it important that all nutrients are supplied through a complete pelleted diet. An advantage to feeding a pelleted diet is that the pellet-type feed enables the farmers, feed formulators and manufactures to design a diet that provides an optimal nutritional mix for tilapia. Precise levels in the protein and lipid percentages of tilapia diets can reduce feed costs and also reduce the amount of underutilized protein and lipids stored as fat in tilapia. Feed comprises of over 60 % of the variable cost in the intensive aquaculture operation; if feed prices were to increase, it would be a substantial amount for tilapia producers to absorb. Therefore an improved diet formulation designed for tilapia can increase profitability. Results indicated that the experimental diets (28 % Crude Protein (CP) -Amino Acid (AA), 28 % CP and 40 % CP) performed similar to the control diet (32 % CP) as it relates to fish growth. The experiment conducted on a commercial scale at an operating farm found that feeding tilapia the lowest protein level diets (28 % CP) resulted in higher biomass gain per raceway, biomass gain per fish and significantly higher protein efficiency ratio (PER) when compared to the control diet (32 % CP). The 28 % CP diet also had the second best FCR value and most importantly higher returns based on its FCR when compared to the control diet (32 % CP) ...|$|E

40|$|For a {{long time}} {{camelina}} was known primarily in North America as a weed. More recently, camelina is being recognized for its value as an oilseed crop. Oil content of the seed, on a dry weight basis, is typically between 30 and 40 percent. The oil contains about 64 percent polyunsaturated, 30 percent monounsaturated, and 6 percent saturated fatty acids (McVay and Lamb 2008). Camelina oil {{can be used in}} both edible and industrial products. Historically, the seeds of camelina were crushed and boiled to release oil for food, medicinal use, and lamp oil. More recently camelina is being grown as a source of vegetable oil high in omega- 3 fatty acids. Camelina is being marketed in Europe in salad dressing and as cooking oil (it is not suitable as deep-fat fry oil). It is also used in cosmetics, skin care products, soaps, and soft detergents (Ehrensing and Guy 2008).

The protein ingredients were sunflower meal, cottonseed meal, canola meal, <b>camelina</b> <b>meal,</b> egg albumen, casein, blood meal, plasma meal, potato protein concentrate, soy protein concentrate, soy protein isolate, and linseed meal, which were fed as the sole source of amino acids for the animals and were included in semi-purified, corn starch-based diets. A semi-purified, nitrogen-free diet (NFD) was used to estimate endogenous losses of AA. In each experiment, pigs were surgically fitted with a simple T-cannula at the distal ileum and fed four experimental diets and the NFD based on a 5 X 2 crossover arrangement in a randomized crossover design, with 5 diets and 2 periods. For experiment 1 (Exp. 1), sunflower meal, cottonseed meal, canola meal, and <b>camelina</b> <b>meal</b> were fed to 19, 42 -kg barrows to determine the apparent (AID) and standardized (AID) digestibility of AA at the terminal ileum. The AID and SID of N and all AA were greatest for sunflower meal (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), and canola meal had similar AID and SID of N, Met, Thr, Leu, and Val. The AID and SID of all essential AA, except for Met and Trp, was lower in <b>camelina</b> <b>meal</b> than sunflower meal (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Cottonseed meal had lower AID and SID of Lys, Ile, Leu, Met, Thr, and Val {{compared to the other}} protein sources (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). In experiment 2 (Exp. 2), egg albumen, casein, blood meal, and plasma meal were fed to 20, 20 -kg barrows to determine the AID and SID of N and AA. The AID and SID of N and indispensable AA was greatest for casein compared to the other ingredients (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Blood meal, plasma meal, and egg albumen had similar AID and SID of many AA. Egg albumen had the greatest AID and SID of Cys among ingredients, while plasma meal had greater AID and SID of Thr than blood meal (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). For experiment 3 (Exp. 3), potato concentrate, soy concentrate, soy isolate, and linseed meal were fed to 20, 25 -kg barrows. The AID and SID of N was similar for potato concentrate, soy concentrate, and soy isolate and greater than linseed meal (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). The AID and SID of Leu and Thr were greater in potato protein concentrate than soy concentrate (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), and AID and SID of Thr was lower in soy isolate than potato concentrate. The apparent and standardized digestibility of all essential amino acids was similar between soy isolate and soy concentrate, and only the AID and SID of Asp was greater in soy isolate than soy concentrate (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Linseed meal had the lowest AID and SID of N and AA digestibility among protein sources (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) in this experiment. In conclusion, animal protein and plant protein concentrates had the highest AID and SID of N and AA, and the digestibility of N and AA vary greatly among oilseed meals. ^ As more grain by-products and alternative feed ingredients are being fed to livestock, researchers are determining the impact that fibrous components have on nutrient digestibility. Two {{experiments were}} conducted to determine the impact that different types of fiber have on the energy, nitrogen (N), and amino acid (AA) digestibility of soybean meal fed to growing pigs. In both studies, soybean meal served as the predominant form of amino acids for the animals, as the fibrous ingredients added little protein to the semi-purified, corn-starch based diets. A semi-purified, nitrogen-free diet (NFD) was used to estimate endogenous flows of AA. Pigs were surgically fitted with a simple T-cannula at the distal ileum and fed four experimental diets and the NFD on a 5 × 2 crossover arrangement in a randomized crossover design, with 5 diets and 2 periods. For experiment 1 (Exp. 1), soybean meal (SBM), SBM + corn hulls, SBM + rice hulls, and SBM + wheat straw were fed to 19, 45 -kg barrows to determine apparent (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of N and AA at the terminal ileum, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of energy and N, and apparent hindgut digestibility (AHD) of energy and N. Rice hulls reduced the AID and SID of N, Arg, Ile, Thr, Trp, and Cys compared to the control and corn fiber diets and had lower AID of N and Glu and SID of N and Leu compared to the wheat straw diet (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Wheat straw decreased the AID of Thr and Val compared to the control diet (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), but did not inhibit the SID of AA. The AID and SID of N and AA between the control and corn fiber diet were similar in the study. The inclusion of rice hulls reduced the AID of energy and N, the ATTD of energy, and the HAD of energy compared to the control group (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). The AID, ATTD, and AHD of energy was lower in pigs fed wheat straw compared to the control diet (P 3 ̆c 0. 05); however, wheat straw did not influence N digestibility. The AID, ATTD, and HAD of N and energy of corn fiber was similar to the control. For experiment 2 (Exp. 2), sugar beet pulp was fed at four different inclusion levels (0 g/kg, 100 g/kg, 200 g/kg, and 300 g/kg) in soybean meal, cornstarch-based diets to 20, 35 -kg barrows. Sugar beet pulp inclusion reduced the AID and SID of N and all indispensable and dispensable AA compared to the control diet (linear, P 3 ̆c 0. 05). The AID of energy and N were significantly reduced with sugar beet pulp was fed (linear and quadratic, P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Sugar beet pulp further reduced the ATTD of energy (linear and quadratic, P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and N (linear, P 3 ̆c 0. 05). There were no differences in AHD of energy and nitrogen among treatments. In conclusion, the SID and AID of N and AA and ATTD of energy and N is uniquely impacted by the source and inclusion level of fiber in diets fed to growing pigs. ...|$|E

Susan SunThe {{ecological}} {{and public health}} liabilities related with consuming petroleum resources have inspired the development of sustainable and environmental friendly materials. Plant protein, as a byproduct of oil extraction, {{has been identified as}} an economical biomaterial source and has previously demonstrated excellent potential for commercial use. Due to the intrinsic structure, protein-based materials are vulnerable to water and present relatively low wet mechanical properties. The purpose of this study focuses on increasing protein surface hydrophobicity through chemical modifications in order to improve wet mechanical strength. However, most of the water sensitive groups (WSG), such as amine, carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups, are also attributed to adhesion. Therefore, the goal of this research is to reduce water sensitive groups to an optimum level that the modified soy protein presents good wet adhesion and wet mechanical strength. In this research, we proposed two major approaches to reduce WSG: 1). By grafting hydrophobic chemicals onto the WSGs on protein surface; 2). By interacting hydrophobic chemicals with the WSGs. For grafting, undecylenic acid (UA), a castor oil derivative with 11 -carbon chain with a carboxyl group at one end and naturally hydrophobic, was used. Carboxyl groups from UA reacted with amine groups from protein and converted amines into ester with hydrophobic chains grafting on protein surface. The successful grafting of UA onto soy protein isolate (SPI) was proved by both Infrared spectroscopy (IR) and ninhydrin test. Wood adhesive made from UA modified soy protein had reached the highest wet strength of 3. 30 ± 0. 24 MPa with fiber pulled out, which was 65 % improvement than control soy protein. Grafting fatty acid chain was verified to improve soy protein water resistance. For interaction approach, soy oil with three fatty acid chains was used to modify soy protein. Soy oil was first modified into waterborne polyurethanes (WPU) to improve its compatibility and reactivity with aqueous protein. The main forces between WPU and protein were hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and physical entanglement. Our results showed that WPU not only increased protein surface hydrophobicity with its fatty acid chains but also enhanced the three-dimensional network structure in WPU-SPI adhesives. WPU modification had increased wet adhesion strength up to 3. 81 ± 0. 34 MPa with fiber pulled out compared with 2. 01 ± 0. 46 MPa of SPI. Based on IR and thermal behavior changes observed by DSC, it was inferred that a new crosslinking network formed between WPU and SPI. To exam if the UA and WPU technologies developed using soy protein are suitable for other plant proteins, we selected camelina protein because camelina oil has superior functional properties for jet fuels and polymers. Like soy protein, camelina protein is also highly water sensitive. However, simply applied UA and WPU to camelina protein following the same methods used for soy proteins, we did not obtain the same good adhesion results compared to what we achieved with soy protein. After protein structure analysis, we realized that camelina protein is more compact in structure compared to soy protein that made it weak in both dry and wet adhesion strength. Therefore, for camelina protein, we unfolded its compact structure with Polymericamine epichlorohydrine (PAE) first to improve flexible chains with more adhesion groups for future reaction with UA or WPU. PAE with charged groups interacted camelina protein through electrostatic interaction and promoted protein unfolding to increase reactivity within protein subunits and between protein and wood cells. Therefore, the wet adhesion strength of camelina protein was improved from zero to 1. 30 ± 0. 23 MPa, which met the industrial standard for plywood adhesives in terms of adhesion strength. Then the wet adhesion strength of camelina protein was further improved after applying UA and WPU into the PAE modified camelina protein. In addition, we also found PAE unfolding significantly improved the dry adhesion strength of camelina protein from 2. 39 ± 0. 52 to 5. 39 ± 0. 50 MPa with 100 % wood failure on two-layer wood test. <b>Camelina</b> <b>meal</b> which is even more economical than camelina protein was studied as wood adhesive. Through a combination of PAE and laccase modification method, the wet adhesion strength of <b>camelina</b> <b>meal</b> was improved as high as 1. 04 ± 0. 19 MPa, which also met industrial standards for plywood adhesives. The results of this study had proven successful modification of oilseed protein to increase water resistance and wet mechanical strength. We have gained in-depth understanding of the relationship between protein structure and wet adhesion strength. The successful modification of plant proteins meeting the industrial needs for bio-adhesives will promote the development of eco-friendly and sustainable materials...|$|E
40|$|Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz {{is a new}} {{industrial}} oilseed crop {{suitable for}} the Canadian prairies and which shows potential benefits for the Canadian bio-economy. This study was carried out to identify the major proteins of the oil-free residue (meal) of C. sativa (camelina) while investigating their structural and physicochemical properties. Canola (Brassica napus L.) {{was used as the}} control in the study. Camelina seeds were treated with Viscozyme® (0. 1 mL/g) to remove mucilage. The mucilage free meal contained 51. 3 % protein (dwb, %N× 6. 25) which was greater than in canola. Both camelina and canola meals shared similar profiles for polypeptides and amino acids. At acidic pHs, canola meal had higher soluble protein content than did <b>camelina</b> <b>meal,</b> but the opposite was observed when the pH moved toward alkaline. A pH of 4. 5 identified as the apparent isoelectric point (pI) of the protein from these two meals, which is presumably a cruciferin-napin complex. The 11 S and 2 S proteins of both seed types were isolated and purified using liquid chromatography. The purified 11 S protein from camelina and canola contained predominantly cruciferin with minor contamination with non-targeted storage proteins. Of the non-cruciferin contamination of camelina, vicilin (7 S) found to be abundant. The purified 2 S protein from camelina contained napin and a noticeable amount of late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein, whereas non-napin contamination was minor in canola. In camelina, cruciferin, napin and vicilin expressed from eleven, four and six genes, respectively, were identified. The oil body proteins were also isolated and several isoforms of oleosin were found in camelina and canola, whereas putative isoforms of caleosin and steroleosin were found only in camelina. The structural and physicochemical properties of cruciferin and napin were studied in response to changing pH and temperature. The predominance of beta-structure and α-helix content in the 2 ˚ structure of cruciferin and napin, respectively, was confirmed for both camelina and canola. Cruciferin from camelina and canola exhibited acid-induced structural unfolding at the 3 ˚structure level. Cruciferin was not completely unfolded and assumed an intermediate state, plausibly a molten globule. Napin structure was not as sensitive as cruciferin to changing medium pH or an increase in temperature. Cruciferin exhibited high thermal stability (> 80 ˚C) at neutral and alkaline pH, whereas the opposite was observed at acidic pH. Results showed that the cruciferin and napin responded differently to changing pH and temperature. Therefore, conditions of oil extraction and protein recovery from meal may affect these two storage proteins differently...|$|E

Three experiments compared ruminal, physiological, and performance responses of beef steers consuming hay ad libitum and receiving grain-based supplements without (control) or with (CAM) the inclusion of <b>camelina</b> <b>meal.</b> In Exp. 1, 9 steers fitted with ruminal cannulas received CAM (2. 04 kg of DM/d; n = 5) or control (2. 20 kg of DM/d; n = 4). Steers receiving CAM had reduced (P = 0. 01) total DMI and tended to have reduced (P = 0. 10) forage DMI compared with control. No treatment effects were detected (P ≥ 0. 35) for ruminal hay degradability parameters. In Exp. 2, 14 steers fed CAM (1. 52 kg of DM/d; n = 7) or control (1. 65 kg of DM/d; n = 7) were assigned to a corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH; 0. 1 μg/kg of BW) and a thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH; 0. 33 μg/kg of BW) challenge. Steers fed CAM had greater (P < 0. 05) serum concentrations of PUFA compared with control before challenges. Upon CRH infusion, plasma haptoglobin concentrations tended (P = 0. 10) to be reduced and ceruloplasmin concentrations increased at a lesser rate in CAM steers compared with control (treatment × time; P < 0. 01). Upon TRH infusion, no treatment effects were detected (P ≥ 0. 55) for serum thyrotropin-stimulating hormone, triiodothyronine, and thyroxine. In Exp. 3, 60 steers were allocated to 20 pens. Pens were assigned randomly to receive CAM (2. 04 kg of DM/steer daily; n = 10) or control (2. 20 kg of DM/steer daily; n = 10) during preconditioning (PC; d − 28 to 0). On d 0, steers were transported for 24 h. Upon arrival, pens were assigned randomly to receive CAM or control during feedlot receiving (FR; d 1 to 29). During PC, CAM steers had reduced (P < 0. 01) forage and total DMI, and tended to have reduced (P = 0. 10) ADG compared with control. Plasma linolenic acid concentrations increased during PC for CAM steers, but not for control (treatment × day; P = 0. 02). During FR, steers fed CAM during PC had reduced (P < 0. 01) forage and total DMI, but tended (P = 0. 10) to have greater G:F compared with control. Steers fed CAM during FR had greater (P < 0. 05) plasma concentrations of PUFA, and reduced rectal temperature and concentrations of haptoglobin and ceruloplasmin during FR compared with control. In summary, CAM supplementation to steers impaired forage and total DMI, did not alter thyroid gland function, increased circulating concentrations of PUFA, and lessened the acute-phase protein reaction elicited by neuroendocrine stress responses...|$|E

Susan SunOilseed {{protein is}} a {{promising}} renewable source {{to be used}} as the replacement of petroleum-based materials for adhesion purpose, and it has drawn increasing attention since soy-based adhesives were developed for wood glues. However, soy protein comprises a portion of humans’ diets, thereby creating competition between utilization of soy protein for protein-based products or human food. Therefore, alternative bio-resources must be discovered. Proteins from camelina sativa provide such potential. Similar to other protein-based polymers, low mechanical strength and poor water resistance are the major drawbacks limiting camelina protein’s further applications. In this research, camelina protein (CP) was modified by unfolding, crosslinking, and co-polymerization treatment for improved flow-ability, adhesion properties and water resistance, which facilitates the industrialization of camelina as an alternative to soy-based adhesives. The physicochemical properties and microstructures of CP were also investigated. To increase the reactivity of CP adhesive, {{the first step is to}} denature the folded structure of native proteins. Camelina protein was extracted from defatted <b>camelina</b> <b>meal</b> through alkali solubilization and acid precipitation and modified with varying amount of NaHSO₃ (0 - 12 % of the protein dry base) and Gdm. Cl (0 - 250 % of the protein dry base). NaHSO₃ treatment broke the disulfide bonds of the CP and thus increased its free sulfhydryl content and surface hydrophobicity. As NaHSO₃ concentration increased, the viscosity, elastic modulus (G') and water resistant of NaHSO₃-modified camelina protein (SMCP) dispersion decreased, and the protein became hydrophobic. Gdm. Cl treatment broke the CPI’s hydrogen bonds but decreased their surface hydrophobicity. Similarly, viscosity, G', and water resistant of Gdm. Cl-modified camelina protein (GMCP) dispersions decreased as Gdm. Cl increased and protein became to aggregate. The reducing effect of NaHSO₃ was more obvious than Gdm. Cl to disrupt CPI’s intermolecular protein interaction but less obvious than Gdm. Cl to reduce the viscosity and water resistant. To further increase the CP’s water resistance, a coupling agent, Ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethyl-aminopropyl- 1 -carbodiimide) (EDC), was applied to stabilize the protein structure by crosslinking the free carboxyl groups and amino groups. The cross-linked CP exhibited increased molecular weight and particle size. Microstructures of modified CP also became rigid and condensed. Accordingly, CP’s increased intermolecular protein interaction resulted in its higher elastic modulus, viscosity and water resistance. The ultrasound pretreatment further increased the crosslink degree of CP, which resulted in protein’s increased aggregation behaviors and compact micro-structures. Consequently, the elastic modulus, viscosity, and water resistance of CP increased accordingly. 	Copolymerization with hydrophobic enhancers was also an effective method to improve CP’s water resistance. In this study, kraft lignin was oxidized by H₂O₂ and then copolymerized with CP as wood adhesives, which exhibited increased wet strength. In the presence of ultrasound irradiation, the H₂O₂-depolymerized kraft lignin exhibited reduced particle size, thermal stability and increased content of hydroxyl groups. Fluorescence spectroscopy analysis revealed that after coupling with pristine or de-polymerized lignin, CP exhibited increased hydrophobicity due to lignin’s increased reactivity with camelina protein. Accordingly, the water resistance of CP-based adhesives improved. In the optimized condition, when CP was copolymerized with ultrasound-induced oxidized lignin, it had increased wet shear adhesion strength from 0. 28 MPa to 1. 43 MPa, with wood panels passing the three-cycle water soaking test...|$|E
