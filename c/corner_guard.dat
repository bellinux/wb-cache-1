Holland then draws around it to sit two. Jones then decides to draw around her own stone {{sitting in the}} top 12ft, {{but it is a}} tad heavy and ends up in the back 4ft.

50|$|Four <b>corner</b> <b>guard</b> towers {{were built}} at the four {{vertices}} of the Outer city walls in 1554. They were all single-storey buildings in the single-eaved Xieshanding cross (square-shaped) style. Approximately 7.5 metres high, they contained one room measuring 6 metres by 6 metres. There were two levels of arrow slits, with three on each level on the two sides facing out of the city, and two on each level on the two sides facing towards the city. The southwestern and northeastern <b>corner</b> <b>guard</b> towers were dismantled in the 1930s, and the southeastern and northwestern <b>corner</b> <b>guard</b> towers were dismantled in 1955 and 1957 respectively.|$|E
50|$|Only {{the southeastern}} <b>corner</b> <b>guard</b> tower has survived. To avoid disrupting rail {{service at the}} nearby main train station while the metro was being built, the metro was routed {{away from the city}} walls and the southeastern <b>corner</b> <b>guard</b> tower. Thus the tower survived, along with a section of the Inner city wall. The northeastern tower was {{dismantled}} in 1920 and its platform in 1953. The northwestern tower was destroyed by Russian cannon fire in 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion. Its platform was dismantled in 1969. The southwestern <b>corner</b> <b>guard</b> tower was dismantled in 1930 {{because of a lack of}} funds for maintenance. Its platform was dismantled in 1969.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, the {{combined}} companies established standard wall and <b>corner</b> <b>guards</b> for the architectural market and expanded their inflatable seal business. Midway through the decade, Pawling diversified into mill mixing and extruding of high-purity silicone (then an elastomer) for electrical wire and cable insulation. By {{the end of}} the decade, the company had branched out into molding of silicone and plastics. The company shortened its name to Pawling Corporation in 1987.|$|R
500|$|Cambridge Castle {{remained}} only a basic fortification until 1284 when Edward I {{decided to}} undertake major expansion works. Over the next 14 years the king {{spent at least}} £2,630 on rebuilding the castle in stone. Edward's castle was four-sided, with circular towers at each <b>corner,</b> <b>guarded</b> by a gatehouse and a barbican. A circular stone keep {{was built on the}} motte. The result was a [...] "major fortress in the latest fashion", albeit never quite completed. Edward stayed at the castle for two nights in 1294.|$|R

[...] On the granite steps of the substructure on the north was a colossal statue of War and to the south one of Peace, created by Eugen Boermel. On the four projecting <b>corners</b> <b>guarded</b> four lion statues. From the north, the rear part of the monument was the Spree Canal. There is a still preserved today the jetty, which was used for barges on the canal. Except for some ventilation shafts are no other entrances from the jetty to the vault under-structure of the monument.|$|R

50|$|Corner judges (also called {{boundary}} judges or line judges) {{are positioned}} {{at the edge}} of the buffer zones, 50 m along each axis beyond marked corners of the aerobatic box. They monitor and record each excursion beyond the buffer zone; the competitor earns a penalty for each such excursion. Each <b>corner</b> judge <b>guards</b> 2 of the 4 lines that define the box. In most competitions, 2 corner judges are used, located at opposing corners. In FAI competitions, 4 corner judges are used, one at each <b>corner.</b> Two judges <b>guard</b> each line; they must agree that a competitor has crossed a boundary in order for the competitor earn a penalty.|$|R

She was so completely under the thrall of the two clever ones, was so systematically kept in sight by one or other of them, and was so afraid to go about the house besides, that every opportunity of speaking to her alone appeared to be forestalled. Over and above that, Mistress Affery, by some means (it was not very difficult to guess, through the sharp arguments of her liege lord), had acquired such a lively conviction of the hazard of saying anything under any circumstances, that she had remained all this time in a <b>corner</b> <b>guarding</b> herself from approach with that symbolical instrument of hers; so that, when a word or two had been addressed to her by Flora, or even by the bottle-green patriarch himself, she had warded off conversation with the toasting-fork like a dumb woman.|$|R

Intuitively, such galleries (of which convex galleries are a special but uninteresting case) should need fewer guards. We show that in any simply connected gallery in which every corner sees at least a fraction ffl of the other corners there exist a set of at most 64 1 ffl log log 1 ffl <b>corners</b> (<b>guard</b> stations) from which every other corner is visible. Similar results also hold for guarding the entire boundary with guards stationed at points on the boundary. These results are similar but slightly stronger than analogous results known for guarding the interior of a gallery. We provide a direct and simple guard assignment scheme that realizes the size bounds. 1 Introduction We consi [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|If {{a pass to}} {{the block}} is not possible, the second option is either to pass to the weak-side guard who flashes top of the key from the weak-side wing {{position}} or passing to the strong-side corner. If the ball is passed to the corner the options are either shoot, pass to the strong-side block, or pick and pop with the wing. If it is passed to the weak-side guard it initiates the [...] "pinch post" [...] option. There are two options. The first and most common is to pass to the weak-side forward who flashes to the elbow (corner of the key at the free throw line) to receive the pass. When he does the options are a rub handoff, back door cut by guard without the ball, post up of the guard on a smaller player, or face up and attack. The second option is a pick and roll with the forward. The advantage to the first option is {{there are so many}} weapons to attack the defense it opens up a lot of freedom and ability to score effectively. The advantage on the second option is that the player who has the ball and uses the screen now has the entire side of the floor to work with to go one on one. Meanwhile, on the other side, the wing sets a screen for the <b>corner</b> <b>guard</b> on the triangle split. If the hand-off is not available, the forward or the guard can pass to the <b>corner</b> <b>guard</b> coming off the screen. If the defense overplays or expects the split, both the wing and the <b>corner</b> <b>guard</b> can back cut to the basket. During all of this time the original strong-side block player is able to establish position for an easy shot while the defender is lured by all of the movement and cutting by the other players.|$|E
50|$|After the {{collapse}} of the Qing Dynasty in 1911, Beijing's fortifications were gradually dismantled. The Forbidden city has remained largely intact, becoming the Palace Museum.

The latter two components now form the Ming City Wall Relics Park. Nothing of the Outer city remains intact. Yongdingmen was completely reconstructed in 2004.|$|E
