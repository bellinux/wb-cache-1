Now the ventilation space above head height is crowded with ducting, conduits, cameras, speakers and equipment acting as a baffle plates with predictable reductions in flow. Often electronic signs have their flat surface at right angles to the main air flow, causing <b>choked</b> <b>flow.</b> Temporary sign boards that stand at the top of escalators also maximise turbulence. The alterations to the ventilation system are important, not only to heat exchange, but also the quality of the air at platform level, particularly given its asbestos content.|$|E

[...] In the diagram, the Fanno line reaches maximum entropy at H= 0.833 and the flow is choked. [...] According to the Second law of thermodynamics, entropy must always increase for Fanno flow. [...] This means that a subsonic flow entering a duct with friction will have an increase in its Mach number until the flow is choked. [...] Conversely, the Mach number of a supersonic flow will decrease until the flow is choked. [...] Each point on the Fanno line corresponds with a different Mach number, and the movement to <b>choked</b> <b>flow</b> is shown in the diagram.|$|E
40|$|The {{prediction}} of two-phase <b>choking</b> <b>flow</b> at low pressure {{is much more}} difficult than at relatively higher pressure (3 ̆e 1 MPa). This is due to the large density ratio and relatively large thermal and mechanical non-equilibrium between the phases at low pressure. For low pressure blow down or <b>choking</b> <b>flow,</b> currently available models are not reliable and satisfactory. In view of these, separate effect tests were conducted to systematically investigate the effects of mechanical and thermal non-equilibrium on the two-phase <b>choking</b> <b>flow</b> in a pipe at low pressure. The mechanical non-equilibrium effects were studied with air-water <b>choking</b> <b>flow.</b> Subcooled water, saturated water and steam-water two-phase <b>choking</b> <b>flow</b> were studied to identify the degree of mechanical and thermal non-equilibrium effects. A typical nozzle and orifice were used as the <b>choking</b> <b>flow</b> section to evaluate the degree of non-equilibrium due to geometrical effects. Experimental data were compared with RELAP 5 and TRAC-M code predictions. The code predictions in general were not in agreement with the air-water <b>choking</b> <b>flow</b> test data. This indicated that the mechanical non-equilibrium effects were not properly modeled in the codes. ^ Because of the above mentioned shortcomings, the mechanistic model which considers the mechanical and thermal non-equilibrium for the two-phase <b>choking</b> <b>flow</b> is developed. This model is compared with the air-water experimental data as the two-phase two-component flow and subcooled water and steam-water data as the two-phase one-component flow.

2500|$|Rayleigh flow {{refers to}} frictionless, non-Adiabatic flow through a {{constant}} area duct where {{the effect of}} heat addition or rejection is considered. [...] Compressibility effects often come into consideration, although the Rayleigh flow model certainly also applies to incompressible flow. [...] For this model, the duct area remains constant and no mass is added within the duct. [...] Therefore, unlike Fanno flow, the stagnation temperature is a variable. [...] The heat addition causes a decrease in stagnation pressure, which {{is known as the}} Rayleigh effect and is critical in the design of combustion systems. [...] Heat addition will cause both supersonic and subsonic Mach numbers to approach Mach 1, resulting in <b>choked</b> <b>flow.</b> [...] Conversely, heat rejection decreases a subsonic Mach number and increases a supersonic Mach number along the duct. [...] It can be shown that for calorically perfect flows the maximum entropy occurs at M = 1. [...] Rayleigh flow is named after John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh.|$|E

40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} to determine the aerodynamic and acoustic performance of two <b>choking</b> <b>flow</b> inlets under static conditions. One inlet <b>choked</b> the <b>flow</b> in the cowl throat by an axial translation of the inlet centerbody. The other inlet employed a translating grid of airfoils to <b>choke</b> the <b>flow.</b> Both inlets were sized to fit a 13. 97 cm diameter fan with a design weight flow of 2. 49 kg/sec. The inlets were operated in both the choked and unchoked modes over a range of weight flows. Measurements were made of inlet pressure recovery, flow distortion, surface static pressure distribution, and fan noise suppression. Choking of the translating centerbody inlet reduced blade passing frequency noise by 29 db while yielding a total pressure recovery of 0. 985. Noise reductions were also measured at 1 / 3 -octave band center frequencies of 2500, 5000, and 20, 000 cycles.

50|$|The {{limiting}} {{case of the}} Venturi effect is when a fluid reaches the state of <b>choked</b> <b>flow,</b> where the fluid velocity approaches the local speed of sound. When a fluid system {{is in a state}} of <b>choked</b> <b>flow,</b> a further decrease in the downstream pressure environment will not lead to an increase in the mass flow rate. However, mass flow rate for a compressible fluid can increase with increased upstream pressure, which will increase the density of the fluid through the constriction (though the velocity will remain constant). This is the principle of operation of a de Laval nozzle. Increasing source temperature will also increase the local sonic velocity, thus allowing for increased mass flow rate but only if the nozzle area is also increased to compensate for the resulting decrease in density.|$|E

50|$|<b>Choked</b> <b>flow</b> is a fluid dynamic {{condition}} {{associated with the}} Venturi effect. When a flowing fluid at a given pressure and temperature passes through a restriction (such as the throat of a convergent-divergent nozzle or a valve in a pipe) into a lower pressure environment the fluid velocity increases. At initially subsonic upstream conditions, the conservation of mass principle requires the fluid velocity to increase as it flows through the smaller cross-sectional area of the restriction. At the same time, the Venturi effect causes the static pressure, and therefore the density, to decrease downstream beyond the restriction. <b>Choked</b> <b>flow</b> is a limiting condition where the mass flow will not increase with a further decrease in the downstream pressure environment while upstream pressure is fixed. Note that the limited parameter is velocity, and thus mass flow can be increased with increased upstream pressure (increased fluid density).|$|E
