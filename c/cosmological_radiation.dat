40|$|While low mass, star forming {{galaxies are}} often {{considered}} {{as the primary}} driver of reionization, their actual contribution to the cosmic ultraviolet background is still uncertain, mostly because the escape fraction of ionizing photons is only poorly constrained.

We investigate the possibility that accreting supermassive black holes in early dwarf galaxies may provide additional feedback and enhance the leakage of ionizing radiation.

40|$|Ionization fronts, {{the sharp}} {{radiation}} fronts behind which H/He ionizing photons from massive {{stars and galaxies}} propagate through space, were ubiquitous in the universe from its earliest times.

We present three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical calculations that reveal that the I-fronts of the first stars and galaxies were prone to violent instabilities, enhancing the escape of UV photons into the early intergalactic medium (IGM) and forming clumpy media in which supernovae later exploded. The enrichment of such clumps with metals by the first supernovae may have led to the prompt formation of a second generation of low-mass stars, profoundly transforming the nature of the first protogalaxies. <b>Cosmological</b> <b>radiation</b> hydrodynamics is unique because ionizing photons coupled strongly to both gas flows and primordial chemistry at early epochs, introducing a hierarchy of disparate characteristic timescales whose relative magnitudes can vary greatly throughout a given calculation.

40|$|For {{over ten}} years, {{the dark side}} of the {{universe}} has been headline news. Detailed studies of the rotation of spiral galaxies, and 'mirages' created by clusters of galaxies bending the light from very remote objects, have convinced astronomers of the presence of large quantities of dark (unseen) matter in the cosmos. Moreover, in the 1990 s, it was discovered that some four to five billion years ago the expansion of the universe entered a phase of acceleration. This implies the existence of dark energy. The nature of these 'dark; ingredients remains a mystery, but they seem to comprise about 95 percent of the matter/energy content of the universe. As for ordinary matter, although we are immersed in a sea of dark particles, including primordial neutrinos and photons from 'fossil' <b>cosmological</b> <b>radiation,</b> both we and our environment are made of ordinary, baryonic matter.

The efficiency and morphology of photo-heating and photo-ionization are dependent on the photon energies. The sub-keV X-rays only impact the IGM near the sources while the keV photons contribute significantly to the X-ray background and heat and ionize the IGM smoothly. The X-rays just below 1 keV are most efficient in heating and ionizing the IGM. We find that the IGM might be heated to over 100 K by $z= 10 $ and the high density source region might reach 10 $^ 4 $ K, limited by atomic hydrogen cooling. This may be important for predicting the 21 -cm neutral hydrogen signals.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the behaviour of bouncing Bianchi type IX `Mixmaster' universes in general relativity. This generalises all {{previous studies of}} the cyclic behaviour of closed spatially homogeneous universes with and without entropy increase. We determine the behaviour of models containing radiation by analytic and numerical integration and show that increase of radiation entropy leads to increasing cycle size and duration. We introduce a null energy condition violating ghost field to create a smooth, non-singular bounce of finite size {{at the end of}} each cycle and compute the evolution through many cycles with and without entropy increase injected at the start of each cycle. In the presence of increasing entropy we find that the cycles grow larger and longer and the dynamics approach flatness, as in the isotropic case. However, successive cycles become increasingly anisotropic at the expansion maxima which is dominated by the general-relativistic effects of anisotropic 3 -curvature. However, it becomes positive after expansion drives the dynamics close enough to isotropy for the curvature to become positive and for gravitational collapse to ensue. In the presence of a positive <b>cosmological</b> constant, <b>radiation</b> and a ghost field we show that, for a very wide range of cosmological constant values, the growing oscillations always cease and the dynamics subsequently approach those of the isotropic de Sitter universe at late times. This model is not included in the scope of earlier cosmic no-hair theorems because the 3 -curvature can be positive. In the case of negative <b>cosmological</b> constant, <b>radiation</b> and an ultra-stiff field (to create non-singular bounces) we show that a sequence of chaotic oscillations also occurs, with sensitive dependence on initial conditions.

We make various correlations between the bulk halo quantities, such as virial, gas, and stellar masses and metallicities and their respective accretion rates, quantifying a variety of properties of the first galaxies up to halo masses of 10 ^ 9 M_. Galaxy formation is not solely relegated to atomic cooling halos with virial temperatures greater than 10 ^ 4 K, where we find a dichotomy in galaxy properties between halos above and below this critical mass scale.

40|$|The {{concordance}} {{model of}} cosmology and structure formation predicts {{the formation of}} isolated very massive stars at high redshifts in dark matter dominated halos of 10 ^ 5 to 10 ^ 6 Msun. These stars photo-ionize their host primordial molecular clouds, expelling all the baryons from their halos. When the stars die, a relic HII region is formed within which large amounts of molecular hydrogen form which will allow the gas to cool efficiently when gravity assembles it into larger dark matter halos. The filaments surrounding the first star hosting halo are largely shielded and provide the pathway for gas to stream into the halo when the star has died. We present the first fully three dimensional <b>cosmological</b> <b>radiation</b> hydrodynamical simulations that follow all these effects. A novel adaptive ray casting technique incorporates the time dependent radiative transfer around point sources. This approach is fast enough so that radiation transport, kinetic rate equations, and hydrodynamics are solved self-consistently. It retains the time derivative of the transfer equation and is explicitly photon conserving. This method is integrated with the cosmological adaptive mesh refinement code enzo, and runs on distributed and shared memory parallel architectures. Where applicable the three dimensional calculation not only confirm expectations from earlier one dimensional results but also illustrate the multi-fold hydrodynamic complexities of HII regions. In the absence of stellar winds the circumstellar environments of the first supernovae and putative early gamma-ray bursts will be of low density ~ 1 cm^- 3.

40|$|The {{fraction}} of hydrogen ionizing photons escaping from galaxies into the intergalactic medium {{is a critical}} ingredient {{in the theory of}} reionization. We use two zoomed-in, high-resolution (4 pc), <b>cosmological</b> <b>radiation</b> hydrodynamic simulations with adaptive mesh refinement to investigate the impact of two physical mechanisms (supernova feedback and runaway OB stars) on the escape fraction (f_esc) at the epoch of reionization (z> 7). We implement a new, physically motivated supernova feedback model that can approximate the Sedov solutions at all (from the free expansion to snowplow) stages. We find that there is a significant time delay of about ten million years between the peak of star formation and that of escape fraction, due to the time required for the build-up and subsequent destruction of the star-forming cloud by supernova feedback. Consequently, the photon number-weighted mean escape fraction for dwarf galaxies in halos of mass 10 ^ 8 - 10 ^ 10. 5 Msun is found to be ~ 11 %, although instantaneous values of f_esc> 20 % are common when star formation is strongly modulated by the supernova explosions. We find that the inclusion of runaway OB stars increases the mean escape fraction by 22 % to ~ 14 %. As supernovae resulting from runaway OB stars tend to occur in less dense environments, the feedback effect is enhanced and star formation is further suppressed in halos with Mvir> 10 ^ 9 Msun in the simulation with runaway OB stars compared with the model without them. While both our models produce enough ionizing photons to maintain a fully ionized universe at z> 7 as observed, a still higher amount of ionizing photons at z> 9 appears necessary to accommodate the high observed electron optical depth inferred from cosmic microwave background observations.
