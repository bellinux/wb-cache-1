25|$|Beginning in 1959, gallery {{cars on the}} Chicago and Northwestern were {{equipped}} with the AAR standard multiple-unit train control system and a <b>control</b> <b>cab</b> that allowed true high speed push-pull train operations without requiring any operators in the locomotive when operating in push mode. This combination of high passenger capacity, rapid turnaround (or flip-backs) and highly reliable push-pull operations has resulted in almost universal adoption of bilevel push-pull operations for commuter and non-electrified corridor services throughout North America.|$|E
25|$|The Leyland 4-tonne {{truck is}} {{conventional}} in layout and design, {{is based on}} a standard C-section chassis and some key components used are shared with the commercial 45 Series light truck. The truck uses the sleeper cab version of the C44 forward <b>control</b> <b>cab,</b> this having room for the driver, two passengers, and stowage for their full kit. As an alternative, the space provided may be used for driver training (the driver plus four personnel) or radio communications equipment.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1910s, the Pennsylvania {{received}} the FF-1 but decided it was too slow for passenger trains and was relegated to heavy freight service. In the mid 1920s, they received the L5 electric which had third rail power supply at the time. When the Pennsylvania built the O1 and the P5, they chose the P5 over the O1 for its ability and power on the rails. After a grade cross accident with the P5, the cab {{was moved to the}} center and was designated P5a. Pennsylvania still searched for the ultimate electric since the P5 did not track well at high speeds and were wondering if the P5a could be improved even further. Soon enough, the Pennsylvania was in luck and found two contacts as early as 1932. The mechanical design of the GG1 was based largely on the New Haven EP3, which had been borrowed earlier from the New Haven Railroad by the PRR to compare it to its current standard electric locomotive, the P5a. In 1933, the PRR decided to replace its P5a locomotives and told General Electric and Westinghouse to design prototype locomotives with the following specifications: a lighter axle load and more power than the P5a, a top speed of at least , a streamlined body design and a single (central) <b>control</b> <b>cab.</b>|$|E

Five GP7B's were built between March and April 1953. The GP7 was the first EMD road locomotive to use a hood unit design instead of a car-body design. This {{proved to be more}} efficient than the car body design as the hood unit cost less to build, was cheaper and easier to maintain, and had much better front and rear visibility for switching.|$|R

2500|$|On March 3, 2009 federal {{investigators}} released records {{showing that the}} train engineer Robert M. Sanchez had allowed a train enthusiast {{to ride in the}} cab several days before the crash, and that he was planning to let him run the train between four stations on the evening of the crash. [...] "I'm gonna do all the radio talkin'... ur gonna run the locomotive& I'm gonna tell u how to do it," [...] Sanchez wrote in one text.

2500|$|The {{motorway}} bridge near Stud√©nka railroad station was undergoing repairs {{that were to}} last until September 2008. On 8 August the workers were putting a beam to span between the two supports {{on the sides of}} the railroad track. Parts of the beam fell onto the track when the train was 452 meters away, approaching the bridge at around [...] The driver noticed the iron bridge carcass swaying and immediately engaged the fast brake and escaped from the <b>control</b> <b>cab</b> to the engine room, which is much better protected against impact. This behavior was later recognized by the Czech Railways inspectors as exactly what drivers should do in this kind of situation. It was said that there is a very high probability that this conduct saved his life.|$|E
50|$|The C855 was {{launched}} in 1964 {{in response to a}} request from the Union Pacific Railroad for a dual engine unit to replace up to ten first-generation locomotives. It was powered by two Model 251C 16-cylinder engines, producing 5,500 horsepower. Only three were built, all in 1964. Two of the units had <b>control</b> <b>cabs</b> and one was a booster unit.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2012, GE {{unveiled}} its first Tier 4 emissions-compliant locomotive, now officially named the ET44AC. The prototype demonstrators, as well as current production units, are visually quite different from previous models. First, the [...] "ET" [...] is 74ft. 6 in. long - an increase of 16 in. from the 73ft. 2 in. length of all previous GE 6-axle models beginning with the [...] "DASH 9" [...] series in 1993. While the front third of the locomotive, including the <b>control</b> <b>cab,</b> is basically unchanged, the rear two-thirds is noticeably different. On Tier 4 demonstrator units the entire midsection above the prime mover is raised to accommodate an advanced exhaust treatment system; {{it is seen as}} a [...] "hump" [...] that rises above the rest of the locomotive considerably. Production units have this hump only over the exhaust manifold directly ahead of the radiator, rather than encompassing the entire midsection. In addition, the radiator section is much larger than that of earlier [...] "ES" [...] units, featuring a two-fan split-cooling system located inside a very large, angular compartment. Grilles under the radiator section have been smoothed out, and there are two extra air intakes on the rear of the locomotive hood. ET44ACs are all equipped with Graham-White electronic bells (E-bells). Tier 4 demonstrator units are equipped with two airhorns: a three-chime horn - facing forward - located behind the cab and a rear-facing two-chime horn protruding {{from the back of the}} radiator. Production units feature the now-standard Nathan-Airchime model K5HL-R2 [...] "Evolution" [...] airhorn mounted on the hood slightly forward of the placement location used on previous models.|$|E

Multiple units are almost invariably equipped with <b>control</b> <b>cabs</b> at both ends, which is why such units are so frequently used to provide commuter services, due to the associated short turn-around time.|$|R

50|$|The Scania PRT-range, also {{referred}} to as new truck range or Scania's truck range, is the current range of trucks manufactured by the Swedish commercial vehicle manufacturer Scania. It was first introduced as the successor to the 4-series in spring 2004 with the high forward <b>control</b> <b>cab</b> Scania R-series, followed by the low forward <b>control</b> <b>cab</b> Scania P-series and bonneted cab Scania T-series later in the year. The T-series was discontinued in 2005, and in 2007 the medium forward <b>control</b> <b>cab</b> Scania G-series was introduced. The entire range is modular, giving a wide range of different configurations for different types of trucks. The trucks are available with engines ranging from a 9-litre I5 to a 16-litre V8, with the V8 only being available in the R-series (and formerly T-series). A successor to the range was launched in August 2016 with new R-series and flat-floor S-series sleeper cabs.|$|E

The average trip time from the VAB along the Crawlerway to Launch Complex 39 is about five hours. [...] Each crawlerway is 7 ft deep and covered with Alabama and Tennessee river rock for its low friction properties to reduce the possibility of sparks. In 2000, NASA unearthed and restored an Apollo-era segment of the crawlerway to provide access to a high-bay building in order to provide protection from a hurricane.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{commuter}} rail {{agencies in the}} United States routinely use cab cars in place of regular passenger coaches on trains. However, with commuter agencies such as Metra, these cars make the train less aerodynamic. The Chicago and North Western Railway had 42 <b>control</b> <b>cabs</b> built by Pullman-Standard in 1960, which eliminated the need for its trains or locomotives to be turned around. [...] It was an outgrowth of multiple-unit operation that was already common on diesel locomotives of the time. The Agence m√©tropolitaine de transport in Canada uses control cars on all its trains, except its electric multiple units, which run as double- ended semipermanently coupled three-car rakes.|$|R
