50|$|Cement {{boards are}} mainly <b>cement</b> <b>bonded</b> {{particle}} boards and <b>cement</b> fibre. <b>Cement</b> <b>bonded</b> particle boards have treated wood flakes as reinforcement, whereas in cement fibre boards have cellulose fibre, {{which is a}} plant extract as reinforcement. Cement acts as binder in both the cases. The fire resistance properties of <b>cement</b> <b>bonded</b> blue particle boards and cement fibre boards are the same. In terms of load-bearing capacity, cement-bonded particle boards have higher capacity than cement fibre boards. Cement particle boards can be manufactured from 6 mm to 40 mm thickness making it ideally suitable for high load bearing applications.These boards are made of a homogeneous mixture and hence are formed as single layer for any thickness.Cement fibre boards are more used in decorative applications and can be manufactured from 3 mm to 20 mm thickness. Fibre boards are made in very thin layers, making it extremely difficult to manufacture high thickness boards. Many manufacturers use additives like mica, aluminium stearate and cenospheres {{in order to achieve}} certain board qualities. Typical cement fiber board is made of approximately 40-60% of cement, 20-30% of fillers, 8-10% of cellulose, 10-15% of mica. Other additives like above mentioned aluminium stearate and PVA are normally used in quantities less than 1%. Cenospheres are used only in low density boards with quantities between 10-15%. The actual recipe depends on available raw materials and other local factors.|$|R

30|$|Transducers {{that are}} widely applied in <b>cement</b> <b>bond</b> {{evaluation}} tools, such as <b>cement</b> <b>bond</b> logs and variable density logs, cannot radiate acoustic energy directionally {{because of the}} characteristics of monopole sources. A phased arc array transmitter, which is a novel transducer that differs from monopole and dipole transducers, is presented in this study. To simulate the acoustic field generated by a phased arc array in a fluid-filled cased borehole with different channelings, a 3 D finite-difference time-domain method is adopted. The acoustic field generated by a traditional monopole source is also simulated and compared with the field generated by the phased arc array transmitter. Numerical simulation results show that the phased arc array radiates energy directionally in a narrow angular range in the borehole, thereby compressing the acoustic energy into a narrow range in the casing pipe, the cement, and the formation. We present the analyses of first-arrival waveforms and the amplitudes of casing waves at different azimuthal angles for the two different sources. The results indicate that employing a directional source facilitates azimuthal identification and analysis of possible channeling behind the casing pipe.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The paper {{reports on}} the early steps in the {{development}} of <b>cement</b> <b>bonded</b> composite beams. The advantage of such products is that they are lighter than reinforced concrete, while more fire-resistant than solid wood or traditional composite beams. Experimental beams were produced to imitate the structure of organic bonded PSL and LSL, using poplar veneer strips and Scots pine strands. In this phase of the research, the aim was to verify that such products are feasible, compare different beam types, and determine the focus for the ongoing development of cement-bonded composite beams. The manufactured beams were found to be fairly lightweight, but their mechanical properties were lower than those of solid wood or composite beams. PSL type beams performed better than cement-bonded LSL. Problem areas that caused the relatively poor performance were identified. Further experimental work will be directed at improving the mechanical performance of the beams. <b>cement</b> <b>bonded</b> wood composites / composite beams / non-destructive testing Kivonat – A cement-kötésű kompozit gerendák kifejlesztésének kezdeti lépései.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the strength of the bond between newly introduced self-adhesive resin cements and tooth structures (i. e., enamel and dentin). Methods: Three self-adhesive cements (SmartCem 2, RelyX Unicem, seT SDI) were tested. Cylindrical-shaped cement specimens (diameter, 3  mm; height, 3  mm) were bonded to enamel and dentin. Test specimens were incubated at 37  °C for 24  h. The shear bond strength (SBS) was tested in a Zwick Roll testing machine. Results were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and t-test. Statistically significant differences were defined at the α =  0. 05 level. Bond failures were categorized as adhesive, cohesive, or mixed. Results: The SBS values ranged from 3. 76 to 6. 81  MPa for <b>cements</b> <b>bonded</b> to enamel and from 4. 48 to 5. 94  MPa for <b>cements</b> <b>bonded</b> to dentin (p >  0. 05 between surfaces). There were no statistically significant differences between the SBS values to enamel versus dentin for any given cement type. All cements exhibited adhesive failure at the resin/tooth interface.
