5000|$|Chickpea flour {{can be used}} in many {{recipes to}} provide both the texture and colour that eggs would {{otherwise}} provide, as well as nutritional benefits including protein, folate, iron, calcium, and many other vitamins and minerals. 1/4 <b>cup</b> chickpea <b>flour</b> combined with 1/4 cup water or other liquid is equivalent to one egg. Veganbaking.net notes that the only drawback to chickpea flour is that it tastes terrible prior to cooking, so if unbaked batter will be eaten, it is advisable to use a different option, like flax or chia seeds, which does not alter the taste of the recipe.|$|R
5000|$|This rule {{can be seen}} in the {{examples}} [...] "there is less flour in this canister" [...] and [...] "there are fewer cups (grains, pounds, bags, etc.) of flour in this canister", which are based on the reasoning that flour is uncountable whereas the unit used to measure the <b>flour</b> (<b>cup</b> etc.) is countable. Nevertheless, even most prescriptivists accept the most common usage [...] "there are less <b>cups</b> of <b>flour</b> in this canister" [...] and prescribe the rule addition that [...] "less" [...] should be used with units of measurement (other examples: [...] "less than 10 pounds/dollars"). Prescriptivists would however consider only [...] "fewer cups of coffee" [...] to be correct in a sentence such as [...] "there are fewer cups of coffee on the table now", where the cups are countable separate objects, although most people now and in the past use [...] "less" [...] even in such cases. In addition, [...] "less" [...] is recommended in front of counting nouns that denote distance, amount, or time. For example, [...] "we go on holiday in fewer than four weeks" [...] and [...] "he can run the 100 m in fewer than ten seconds" [...] are not advised.|$|R

50|$|Generally one {{teaspoon}} (5 g) {{of baking}} powder {{is used to}} raise a mixture of one cup (125 g) of <b>flour,</b> one <b>cup</b> of liquid, and one egg. However, if the mixture is acidic, baking powder's additional acids will remain unconsumed in the chemical reaction and often lend an unpleasant taste to food. High acidity {{can be caused by}} ingredients like buttermilk, lemon juice, yogurt, citrus or honey. When excessive acid is present, some of the baking powder should be replaced with baking soda. For example, one <b>cup</b> of <b>flour,</b> one egg, and one cup of buttermilk requires only ½ teaspoon of baking powder—the remaining leavening is caused by buttermilk acids reacting with ¼ teaspoon of baking soda.|$|R

5000|$|The {{other kind}} of [...] "cup cake" [...] {{referred}} to a cake whose ingredients were measured by volume, using a standard-sized cup, instead of being weighed. Recipes whose ingredients were measured using a standard-sized cup could also be baked in cups; however, they were more commonly baked in tins as layers or loaves. In later years, when the use of volume measurements was firmly established in home kitchens, these recipes became known as 1234 cakes or quarter cakes, so called because they {{are made up of}} four ingredients: one cup of butter, two cups of sugar, three <b>cups</b> of <b>flour,</b> and four eggs. They are plain yellow cakes, somewhat less rich and less expensive than pound cake, due to using about half as much butter and eggs compared to pound cake. The names of these two major classes of cakes were intended to signal the method to the baker; [...] "cup cake" [...] uses a volume measurement, and [...] "pound cake" [...] uses a weight measurement.|$|R

This fact received considerable publicity (1) recently when 11 men died and 52 became ill from eating pancakes made with roach powder. The sodium fluoride was mistaken for baking powder at the Salvation Army in Pittsburgh. From 1 to 2 teaspoon-fuls of baking powder per <b>cup</b> of <b>flour</b> {{is commonly used}} in pancakes. It is thus possible for one to get from 5 to 10 grams of sodium fluoride, which is considered a fatal dose.

50|$|Special cake flour {{with a high}} starch-to-gluten {{ratio is}} made from fine-textured, soft, low-protein wheat.

60|$|Edith Nelson met the {{unexpected}} {{at every turn}} of the trail, and she trained her vision so that she saw in the landscape, not the obvious, but the concealed. She, who had never cooked in her life, learned to make bread without the mediation of hops, yeast, or baking-powder, and to bake bread, top and bottom, in a frying-pan before an open fire. And when the last <b>cup</b> of <b>flour</b> was gone and the last rind of bacon, {{she was able to}} rise to the occasion, and of moccasins and the softer-tanned bits of leather in the outfit to make a grub-stake substitute that somehow held a man's soul in his body and enabled him to stagger on. She learned to pack a horse as well as a man,--a task to break the heart and the pride of any city-dweller, and she knew how to throw the hitch best suited for any particular kind of pack. Also, she could build a fire of wet wood in a downpour of rain and not lose her temper. In short, in all its guises she mastered {{the unexpected}}.

To a few--men--this sight had been vouchsafed, and though long years may have passed, they have not forgotten, nor will they ever forget. She never talked of herself, so that it were well {{to let it go}} down that when in repose, expurgated, Greek she certainly was.

50|$|The rice noodle {{sheets are}} made from a viscous mixture of 1 <b>cup</b> of rice <b>flour</b> and 1/4 <b>cup</b> tapioca or glutinous rice flour and water; this recipe will scale well {{as long as the}} ratio of flours and water remain the same. The {{combination}} of both types of flour and water should be a consistency of heavy cream. The rice flour serves as the bulk and flavor of rice, the tapioca flour gives the noodle elasticity and springiness; therefore, it should never crumble nor be too chewy. It should never have the al dente texture as with Italian pasta. Boric acid is sometimes used to make it have a very smooth texture or plastic sheen. Boric acid is banned for human consumption as a food ingredient in the United States, European Union, and developing countries as it may cause kidney failure.|$|R
50|$|Another {{method of}} making springerle {{is to not}} chill the dough at all. Commonly, after mixing all the {{ingredients}} together, one would cover a surface with flour, and use a regular rolling pin (also covered in flour) to roll out the dough to about half-an-inch of thickness. Flour would be spread over the top surface of the rolled-out dough, and also on the specialized Springerle rolling pin. One would whack the Springerle rolling pin against one's hand a few times, to dislodge any flour caked into the designs on it, and then proceed to carefully but firmly roll out the molds. One uses a knife to cut out the small, rectangular cookies (often 2x1 inches), and place them on a wooden board to dry overnight (or for at least twelve hours). As this process is repeated, the dough gets more brittle due to the added flour and doesn't hold the molds as well. Therefore, {{it is important to}} roll the dough out in small batches (instead of all at once), to keep the moisture in so the cookies hold together. Anise seed is sprinkled on the baking sheets just before putting them in the oven (about ten minutes is usually sufficient, but the cooking time also depends on thickness). 1-2 teaspoons of anise extract can also be added to the dough to increase the taste (which is rather like licorice), and the amount of cookies varies on the thickness. The usual recipe with 4 eggs and 3-4 <b>cups</b> of <b>flour</b> can yield anywhere from 60-144 cookies, depending on thickness and the experience of the maker.|$|R
