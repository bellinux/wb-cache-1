5|$|In 1849 the British {{seized control}} of Lahore from the Sikh Empire. During the British Raj, the mosque and the {{adjoining}} fort continued {{to be used as}} a military garrison. The 80 cells built into the walls surrounding the its vast courtyard were demolished by the British after the Freedom Fight of 1857, so as to prevent them from being used for anti-British activities.

40|$|NK {{cells can}} kill transformed, {{infected}} and stressed cells while most normal <b>cells</b> <b>are</b> spared. NK <b>cells</b> <b>are</b> activated by various endogenous self-ligands, {{some of which}} are actually expressed by normal cells. Thus, NK <b>cells</b> <b>are</b> inherently self-reactive and consequently, potentially auto-aggressive.

5|$|The {{laboratory}} on the Castellania's {{second floor}} {{which was used}} by the Malta Fever Commission was restored and converted into The Brucellosis Museum in 1980, and it is now open to the public by appointment. Since the British period some of the prison <b>cells</b> <b>were</b> modified and converted into government offices and at present still serve this purpose. Other parts of the Castellania's interior, including the chapel and one of the prison <b>cells,</b> <b>were</b> restored in the 1990s. The restored cell appears on the front cover of the book Kissing the Gallows: A Cultural History of Crime, Torture and Punishment in Malta, 1600–1798, authored by William Zammit. There were further plans to restore the façade in the late 1990s, but nothing materialized. The façade is again on plan to be restored as part of a number of projects of the Valletta 2018 - European Capital of Culture. A detailed study for the restoration of the façade has taken place, which gave the way to call for a public tender, and work began in June 2017.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of the Cell Broadband Engine (<b>Cell</b> <b>BE)</b> Architecture for executing a Polyphase Filter Bank algorithm, used for efficient signal channelisation. The heterogeneous multi-core architecture of the <b>Cell</b> <b>BE</b> is introduced and important considerations for developing programs for the <b>Cell</b> <b>BE</b> are discussed. The Polyphase Filter Bank DFT channeliser is discussed in depth, and the process of mapping this algorithm onto the <b>Cell</b> <b>BE</b> processor architecture is shown. An evaluation of {{the performance of}} the Polyphase Filter Bank algorithm on the <b>Cell</b> <b>BE</b> processor is presented with results obtained from the Sony Playstation 3 and the IBM Full System Simulator. The effect of the parameters of the algorithm on the performance <b>is</b> investigated. The <b>Cell</b> <b>BE</b> processor is shown to be efficient for some algorithms, and the factors that have both positive and negative impact on its performance are presented. The current implementation of the <b>Cell</b> <b>BE</b> processor has some important limitations for use in scientifi...|$|R

40|$|Granulated metnial gland (GMG) {{cells and}} their {{analogous}} <b>cells</b> <b>are</b> a prominent {{feature of the}} maternal placenta in rodents and in primates, including the human. Evidence which relates to the origin of these <b>cells</b> <b>is</b> reviewed and shows that there is now conclusive evidence that GMG <b>cells</b> <b>are</b> a type of leukocyte. Studies to define the type of leukocyte have been inconclusive overall, although several {{studies have suggested that}} GMG <b>cells</b> <b>are</b> a type of NK <b>cell.</b> However, it <b>is</b> proposed thatattempting to define GMG cells as a type of leukocyte which is already known, like NK <b>cells,</b> <b>is</b> inappropriate and GMG <b>cells</b> should <b>be</b> considered as a separate leukocyte population. Granulated metnial gland <b>cells</b> <b>are</b> closely associated with pregnancy but technically cannot be described as pregnancy specific.
