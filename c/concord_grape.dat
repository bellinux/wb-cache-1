5|$|Thomcord grape is {{a hybrid}} of Thompson Seedless grape (Vitis vinifera, or Sultanina), which is popular in {{supermarkets}} during the summer, and seeded <b>Concord</b> <b>grape</b> (Vitis labrusca), commonly used to make grape juice and jelly. It is a plump, juicy, seedless table grape and is slightly firmer than Concord. Thomcord has a blue-black skin with medium thickness and a whitish bloom. Unlike Concord, whose tough skin separates easily from the fruit, Thomcord has a more edible skin that clings to the flesh, much like Thompson Seedless. It has an aromatic flavor, similar to the Concord in taste ("labrusca"), though lighter due to the sweet, mild taste from Thompson Seedless.|$|E
25|$|Wine {{can also}} be made from other species of grape or from hybrids, created by the genetic {{crossing}} of two species. V. labrusca (of which the <b>Concord</b> <b>grape</b> is a cultivar), V. aestivalis, V. ruprestris, V. rotundifolia and V. riparia are native North American grapes usually grown to eat fresh or for grape juice, jam, or jelly, and only occasionally made into wine.|$|E
25|$|Plants rich in {{anthocyanins}} are Vaccinium species, such as blueberry, cranberry, and bilberry; Rubus berries, including black raspberry, red raspberry, and blackberry; blackcurrant, cherry, eggplant (aubergine) peel, black rice, <b>Concord</b> <b>grape,</b> muscadine grape, red cabbage, {{and violet}} petals. Red-fleshed peaches and apples contain anthocyanins. Anthocyanins are less abundant in banana, asparagus, pea, fennel, pear, and potato, {{and may be}} totally absent in certain cultivars of green gooseberries.|$|E

40|$|This {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of jam processing of <b>Concord</b> <b>grapes</b> variaty on the physiochemical properties. The antioxidant phenolic compounds were extracted and analyzed by determining the total phenolic content (Folin Ciocalteu), as well as by employing free radical DPPH. The chemical composition of <b>Concord</b> <b>grapes</b> variety is in agreement with the literature concerning at moisture content, ash content and  total soluble solids. The results showed that grape jam had the highest antioxidant activity than grape juices (26. 98 % respectively 12. 14 %)   and total phenolic content is bigger in fresh <b>Concord</b> <b>grapes</b> (390 mg GAE/ 100 g than 235 mg GAE/ 100 g  in <b>grape</b> jam). Although <b>Concord</b> <b>grapes</b> it should be considered as a raw material for jam processing, they have the same potential as fresh fruits or even higher. </p...|$|R

40|$|Considering how popular grapes are {{in terms}} of their {{antioxidant}} benefits, we compared concord, purple, red, and green grapes for total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and carbohydrate concentration.

The <b>concord</b> <b>grapes</b> and purple grapes had significantly higher TAC in the homogenates than did the red or green <b>grapes.</b> The <b>concord</b> <b>grapes</b> and green grapes had significantly higher TAC in the pulp than in the cytosol whereas the red and purple grapes had approximately the same amount.
