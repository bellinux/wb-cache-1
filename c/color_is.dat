5|$|The {{color in}} the {{original}} print is breathtaking; Redskin leaves an impression of a kaleidoscope of awe-inspiring backgrounds, with such much happening in the foreground that one hardly has time {{to take in the}} whole frame. The <b>color</b> <b>is</b> used for emotional impact; black and white (toned amber) represents the world of the white man; <b>color</b> <b>is</b> reserved for scenes of Indian life.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Thelephora palmata {{can be used}} for {{mushroom}} dyeing. Depending on the mordant used, colors ranging from blackish brown to dark grayish green to greenish brown can be obtained from the dyeing process; without a mordant, a light-brown <b>color</b> <b>is</b> produced.|$|E
5|$|The {{single most}} major aspect of shell {{variation}} within the genus {{is the color}} patterning. In general, many arboreal snails are brightly colored, obvious examples being the bulimulid genera Drymaeus and Liguus, the cepolid Polymita, and the camaenid Papuina. However, Polymita, Liguus and Amphidromus are particularly noted for their color variations. The basic ground color of Amphidromus appears to be yellow, and this <b>color</b> <b>is</b> usually (except for Amphidromus entobaptus) confined to the surface layers of the shell, since worn specimens appear to be nearly devoid of color. In some species the background <b>color</b> <b>is</b> whitish, and a few have dark background colors. The apical whorls are pale, purple, brown, or black, and this sometimes varies within a population (as in A. quadrasi). A few species, for example A. schomburgki, have a deciduous green periostracum.|$|E

For example, blue and orange.Triadic <b>colors</b> <b>are</b> <b>colors</b> that <b>are</b> evenly across from each other, in a triangle over the color wheel. For example, the primary colors red, yellow, and blue <b>are</b> triadic <b>colors.</b>|$|R
5|$|Eye <b>color</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} {{a subset of}} coloring, and coat color definitions often include standards for the eyes, as many genes which control eye color will also affect the coat color or vice versa. The American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association (AFRMA) lists black, pink, ruby, and odd-eyed (two different-colored eyes) as possible eye colors, depending on the variety of rat shown. Ruby refers to eyes which at a glance appear black but which are on closer observation a deep, dark red.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} notable uses of this meaning is found in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The Emerald City in this story {{is a place where}} {{everyone}} wears tinted glasses that make everything appear green. According to the populist interpretation of the story, the city’s <b>color</b> <b>is</b> used by the author, L. Frank Baum, to illustrate the financial system of America in his day, as he lived in a time when America was debating the use of paper money versus gold.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium(V) {{fluoride}} forms {{white crystals}} where protactinium ions {{are arranged in}} pentagonal bipyramids and coordinated by 7 other ions. The coordination is the same in protactinium(V) chloride, but the <b>color</b> <b>is</b> yellow. The coordination changes to octahedral in the brown protactinium(V) bromide and is unknown for protactinium(V) iodide. The protactinium coordination in all its tetrahalides is 8, but the arrangement is square antiprismatic in protactinium(IV) fluoride and dodecahedral in the chloride and bromide. Brown-colored protactinium(III) iodide has been reported where protactinium ions are 8-coordinated in a bicapped trigonal prismatic arrangement.|$|E
30|$|Hull and {{pericarp}} <b>color</b> <b>were</b> phenotyped on all 286 ORSC accessions {{grown out}} at the Guterman Bioclimatic Laboratory from 2006 to 2007. Hull color and pericarp <b>color</b> <b>were</b> evaluated on three seeds each, produced by three individuals from each accession. Hull <b>color</b> <b>was</b> annotated as black hull or light hull. Pericarp <b>color</b> <b>was</b> scored numerically: red pericarp[*]=[*] 1.0, white pericarp[*]=[*] 0 and pericarp <b>color</b> scores <b>were</b> then averaged across individuals to determine the accession mean. Only 157 of these 286 accessions with complete data for both hull and pericarp <b>color</b> <b>were</b> {{included in the final}} analysis.|$|R

5|$|The Sun's <b>color</b> <b>is</b> white, with a CIE color-space index near (0.3, 0.3), {{when viewed}} from space or when the Sun is high in the sky. When {{measuring}} all the photons emitted, the Sun is actually emitting more photons in the green portion of the spectrum than any other. When the Sun is low in the sky, atmospheric scattering renders the Sun yellow, red, orange, or magenta. Despite its typical whiteness, most people mentally picture the Sun as yellow; {{the reasons for this}} are the subject of debate.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of commercially available synthetic diamonds are yellow and {{are produced by}} so-called high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) processes. The yellow <b>color</b> <b>is</b> caused by nitrogen impurities. Other colors may also be reproduced such as blue, green or pink, which {{are a result of}} the addition of boron or from irradiation after synthesis.|$|E

50|$|<b>Colors</b> <b>are</b> not in light. <b>Colors</b> <b>are</b> {{nothing more}} than the eye's activity, {{appearing}} in polar contrasts. Philosophers have always surmised that color belongs to the eye rather than to things. Locke, for example, claimed that <b>color</b> <b>was</b> at the head of his list of secondary qualities.|$|R
5|$|Unlike the {{somewhat}} reddish Pluto and Triton, Eris appears almost white. Pluto's reddish <b>color</b> <b>is</b> {{thought to be}} due to deposits of tholins on its surface, and where these deposits darken the surface, the lower albedo leads to higher temperatures and the evaporation of methane deposits. In contrast, Eris is far enough from the Sun that methane can condense onto its surface even where the albedo is low. The condensation of methane uniformly over the surface reduces any albedo contrasts and would cover up any deposits of red tholins.|$|E
5|$|White dripstones {{are pure}} calcite without defilement, the red <b>color</b> <b>is</b> given by iron oxide (rust) in small amounts. In Lebanon iron oxide has a red color {{instead of the}} brown beige color which is common in {{northern}} countries. The reason is a different chemical reaction caused by the high temperature which produces {{a different kind of}} iron oxide.|$|E
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of +0.08, Capella is {{the brightest star}} in the constellation Auriga, the sixth-brightest star in the night sky, the third-brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere (after Arcturus and Vega), and the fourth-brightest star {{visible to the naked eye}} from the latitude 40° N. It appears to be a rich yellowish-white color, although the yellow <b>color</b> <b>is</b> more apparent during daylight observation with a telescope, due to the contrast against the blue sky.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{effects of}} light only {{last for a}} few minutes, thus the canvases documenting such ephemera {{received}} attention {{for no more than}} a few minutes a day. Further complicating matters, the light of subsequent sunrises, for example, could alter substantially and would require separate canvases within the series. Subsequently, different hues are evident in each painting, and in each work, <b>color</b> <b>is</b> used to describe not only direct but reflected light. At differing times of day and in various seasons stacks absorb the light from diverse parts of the color spectrum. As a result, the residual light that is reflected off of the stacks is seen as ever-changing, and manifests in distinctive coloring.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, the spore <b>color</b> <b>is</b> white. The spores are smooth, {{ellipsoidal}} to tear-shaped, hyaline (translucent), not amyloid, {{and measure}} 3.9–5.2 by 2.6–3.3μm. The basidia (spore-bearing {{cells in the}} hymenium) are four-spored and hyaline, with dimensions of 16–20 by 4–5μm. They have clamps at their bases. There are no cystidia on either the edges (cheilocystidia) or faces (pleurocystidia) of the gills. The arrangement of the hyphae in the hymenophoral tissue varies from regular to interwoven. The cap cuticle is a cutis (a type of tissue where the hyphae are arranged more or less parallel to the surface), formed by hyphae with septa, roughly 4–9μm in diameter. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae. The sclerotium is made of hyphae that have yellow pigment in their walls that appear in cross-section to be pseudoparenchymatous (compactly interwoven short-celled hyphae that resemble parenchyma of higher plants), and measure 5–10μm in diameter.|$|E
5|$|Liukin is {{fluent in}} English and Russian. She {{graduated}} from Spring Creek Academy, located in Plano, Texas, {{in the spring}} of 2007. She enrolled as a freshman international business major at Southern Methodist University in January 2008, and took a leave from classes to concentrate on preparations for the 2008 Olympic Games. She returned to campus in spring 2009, but her travel schedule and professional commitments caused her to withdraw {{before the end of the}} semester. She stated that she hoped to continue her studies at New York University in the future.

5|$|Many {{minerals}} provide pigments {{which have}} been used in green paints and dyes over the centuries. Pigments, in this case, are minerals which reflect the color green, rather that emitting it through luminescent or phosphorescent qualities. The large number of green pigments makes it impossible to mention them all. Among the more notable green minerals, however is the emerald, which is colored green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3), is called chrome green, also called viridian or institutional green when used as a pigment. For many years, the source of amazonite's color was a mystery. Widely thought to have been due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors, the blue-green <b>color</b> <b>is</b> likely to be derived from small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar. Copper {{is the source of the}} green color in malachite pigments, chemically known as basic copper(II) carbonate.|$|E
5|$|Strongly built, {{and compact}} yet elegant, Andalusians have long, thick manes and tails. Their most common coat <b>color</b> <b>is</b> gray, {{although}} {{they can be}} found in many other colors. They are known for their intelligence, sensitivity and docility. A sub-strain within the breed known as the Carthusian, is considered by breeders to be the purest strain of Andalusian, though there is no genetic evidence for this claim. The strain is still considered separate from the main breed however, and is preferred by breeders because buyers pay more for horses of Carthusian bloodlines. There are several competing registries keeping records of horses designated as Andalusian or PRE, but they differ on their definition of the Andalusian and PRE, the purity of various strains of the breed, and the legalities of stud book ownership. At least one lawsuit is in progress , to determine the ownership of the Spanish PRE stud book.|$|E
5|$|The American Cream is {{the only}} breed of draft horse {{developed}} in the United States that is still in existence today. The breed descends from a foundation mare named Old Granny. She was probably foaled between 1900 and 1905, and was first noticed at an auction in Story County, Iowa, in 1911 and purchased by Harry Lakin, a well known stock dealer. She was eventually sold to Nelson Brothers Farm in Jewell, Iowa. Her breeding is not known, but she was cream-colored and many of her foals were as well; they sold for above-average prices because of their color. Her cream-colored coat, pink skin and amber eyes are defining standards for the breed, and the <b>color</b> <b>is</b> now known as gold champagne. In 1946, {{two years after the}} breed registry was formed, 98 percent of the horses registered could be traced back to Old Granny.|$|E
