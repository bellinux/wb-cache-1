This study was performed to examine the difficulties experienced by <b>childcare</b> <b>workers</b> when communicating their concerns to parents about their childrenʼs special care needs. For this objective, focus group interviews were held with 22 <b>childcare</b> <b>workers.</b> 　Based on our analysis, we extracted three categories from 207 response items, i. e., Lack of professional skills on the part of <b>childcare</b> <b>workers,</b> Lack of positive relationships between parents and <b>childcare</b> <b>workers,</b> and Lack of mental and physical stability on the part of parents. We also identiﬁed six subcategories: “Lack of conﬁdence on the part of childcare workers,” “Lack of professional knowledge on the part of childcare workers,” “Instability of trust relationships,” “Perception gaps,” “Parents displaying their negative feelings,” and “Parentsʼ health issuesʼ. These six subcategories were assigned 16 codes in total, among which the most frequent codes were childcare workersʼ Excessive priority to parentsʼ situation, Lack of experience regarding methods of communication, and Lack of coordination among <b>childcare</b> <b>workers.</b> 　When <b>childcare</b> <b>workers</b> communicate their concerns about children to their parents, they tend to allow the parentsʼ thoughts and situation to take precedence over what needs to be communicated, suggesting that <b>childcare</b> <b>workers</b> giving excessive priority to parentsʼ situation constitutes the prime factor underlying the difficulties experienced by <b>childcare</b> <b>workers</b> when informing parents of their childrenʼsʼ special needs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis was to {{discover}} the corelation between sports activities of <b>childcare</b> <b>workers</b> and the chosen factors of healthy living. For this purpose we interviewed 40 <b>childcare</b> <b>workers</b> from different towns in Slovenia. We had four goals: to find {{the characteristics of the}} environment in which <b>childcare</b> <b>workers</b> live; to analyse the activity of the childcare workers; to find the nutritional habits and status of <b>childcare</b> <b>workers</b> in relation with their activity; to find the frequency of smoking, taking painkillers and drinking alcohol in relation to their sports activity. The data was collected {{with the help of a}} questionnaire with 33 variables. The data was processed with SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). FREQUENCIES was also used to calculate the frequency of individual answers and DESCRIPTIVES was used to calculate the descriptive statistics. On the basis of the obtained results, adequate recoded variables, equally including different components of individual sets, were made to verify the hypothesis. On the basis of the existing researches and available literature the following variables were constructed: smoking, pain, alcohol, sick leave, breakfast, consumption, frequency of sports activities and duration of sports activities. The statistic characteristics were based on the level of five-percent risk. It was found that <b>childcare</b> <b>workers</b> that are more active smoke less than those that are less active. There are no statistic characteristic differences between the <b>childcare</b> <b>workers</b> that drink more and those that drink less alcohol. It was also discovered that the <b>childcare</b> <b>workers</b> that are active enough have a better and more regular consumption. The research also showed that more than a half of active <b>childcare</b> <b>workers</b> occasionally take painkillers and more than a half inactive <b>childcare</b> <b>workers</b> do not take painkillers...|$|R

We {{report on a}} study in which <b>childcare</b> <b>workers</b> and designers jointly developed strategies to encourage low-chemical cleaning in childcare. The workers' inclusion in design sought to address the barriers and triggers to effective communication of cleaning principles to <b>childcare</b> <b>workers</b> across the sector. Participatory design (PD) is rarely used in graphic design. Indeed, we speculate that PD poses a specific challenge in graphic design since participation exposes prospective audience members to the messages to be communicated. In our study, designing immersed the <b>childcare</b> <b>workers</b> in the information for dissemination, prompting them to see designs targeting them as irrelevant and to nominate an audience of relief workers, children and parents as the target for design. Employing case study method, we explore the complex contextual and human factors that lead the <b>childcare</b> <b>workers</b> to no longer represent themselves in the PD process...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The role of <b>childcare</b> <b>workers</b> at {{registered}} nurseries {{in supporting}} exclusive breastfeeding practice is important, as many newborn babies {{are placed in}} nurseries during working hours. To increase exclusive breastfeeding rates among working mothers, understanding <b>childcare</b> <b>workers</b> 2 ̆ 019 experiences and needs relating to supporting these mothers is crucial. This study aimed to explore <b>childcare</b> <b>workers</b> 2 ̆ 019 experiences of supporting breastfeeding at registered nurseries. Methods We used a qualitative design to conduct in-depth, semi-structured interviews with ten <b>childcare</b> <b>workers</b> at seven registered nursery centres in Kuala Muda District, Malaysia. Attitudes towards exclusive breastfeeding practice, experiences of breastfeeding training and information, and experiences supporting exclusive breastfeeding at the nursery were explored. Participants were asked to suggest improvements for exclusive breastfeeding practice at their nursery. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and translated before analysis. Results All participants demonstrated a positive attitude in supporting and promoting exclusive breastfeeding practice, mainly centred on the advantages of breastfeeding. Various supports have been found such as labelling bottled breastmilk, allowing the mother {{to come to the}} nursery during breaks, and providing reading materials. However, several issues emerged that include parents 2 ̆ 019 choice on infant feeding practice, insufficient content on breastfeeding topics during training, and adherence to the (not recommended) practice of bottle feeding expressed breastmilk. Recommendations to enhance breastfeeding were also suggested by participants. Conclusion <b>Childcare</b> <b>workers</b> may serve as another potential resource for sustaining exclusive breastfeeding at registered nurseries...|$|R

In terms of group processes, {{it may well be}} that the boss or certain forceful or ambitious individuals with the team take all the interesting work leaving only a little of the most boring tasks for the others. Alternatively, the structure of the organization may simply promote this inefficiency. Of course, few if any employees (even among those who would prefer to leave) want to be fired or laid off, so the vast majority are unwilling and unlikely to call attention to the dispensable nature of their role.|$|E

Communication within a family, between parents and the child, and between the <b>childcare</b> <b>worker</b> and the child is crucial for the integrated development of the child in its early developmental stage.

The practical part contains activities – games with simple finger puppets and the analysis of playtime with finger puppets, followed by the final results based on the analysis. The application of finger plays with finger puppets results in a relaxed environment in the group, encourages children verbally and affects the communication between the child and the <b>childcare</b> <b>worker,</b> as well as among the children themselves.

Unlike other intestinal parasitic infections such as giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis, the epidemiology of blastocystosis in children who live in crowded settings such as day-care centers and orphanages has been rarely explored. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate incidence and risk factors of Blastocystis infection in an orphanage every two consecutive months during April 2003 to April 2004, in Bangkok, Thailand.
