500|$|Falcon Acoustics {{was granted}} a licence by the BBC for the 15 ohm version of the LS3/5a in 2013 and {{commenced}} production in 2014 using drive units produced in-house by Falcon Acoustics. The Falcon F B110 bass unit is a re-engineered version using the same components of the original KEF B110 SP1003 with a doped Bextrene cone and a neoprene surround. The Falcon F T27 tweeter again uses the same components as the original KEF T27 SP1032 and has a 19mm mylar dome fitted. Both Falcon units were designed by Malcolm Jones who while employed at KEF between 1962 and 1974 {{was responsible for the}} design of the KEF B110 and T27 units originally used in the LS3/5 and LS3/5a. Both units are graded/selected to meet the BBC specification. Crossovers are <b>close</b> <b>tolerance</b> pair matched versions of the original BBC LS3/5a crossover design [...] using tapped transformers for high frequency adjustments.|$|E
2500|$|Wheel {{steering}} {{is standard}} (though a tiller was an option on the 37R). The [...] rudder is an internally-mounted spade-type with a [...] "spitfire wing" [...] planform. The rudder is constructed of two molded composite shells which are bonded together and injected with two-part foam for added strength. The rudder post is all stainless steel {{with a flat}} stainless steel plate reinforcing weldment positioned within the rudder. The rudder post passes through the hull with a water-tight, <b>close</b> <b>tolerance</b> fit between the shaft and the nylon bearing. The rudder post is brought up through the cockpit sole, with the steering quadrant mounted on top. The pedestal system is cable-linked with the radial driver being connected to the rudder post by a keyway and lock nuts. Access to the system is achieved via the removable fiberglass cover located in the cockpit sole. This design provides excellent support for the rudder stock. The rudder may be removed by loosening the bolt, rollers and quadrant. The rudder must be supported from below during this procedure.|$|E

50|$|Another {{application}} of single crystal solids is in materials {{science in the}} production of high strength materials with low thermal creep, such as turbine blades.

50|$|H&R was justifiably {{proud of}} the Reising's {{superior}} accuracy and balance, lighter weight, and ease of manufacturing {{when compared to the}} Thompson.

The gun quickly became despised by front-line Marines, and Lieutenant Colonel Merritt A. Edson, Commander, 1st Marine Raider Battalion, ordered that Reisings be flung into Guadalcanal's crocodile infested Lunga River, as his troops resorted to reliable bolt-action Springfield rifles.|$|E

5000|$|Like its predecessor, the FM, the FM2n has {{a long-standing}} {{reputation}} for reliability and durability. It has an extremely strong body of copper-aluminum-silicon (silumin) alloy. [...] The FM2's film transport consists of high-strength hardened metal gears and moving parts, mounted on clusters of ball bearings. The camera's precision-tapered, high-strength vertical metal shutter blades were fabricated originally of lightweight titanium (later production FM2 shutter blades {{were made of}} aluminum), while the mirror/shutter mechanism rides on self-lubricating bearings. The mirror linkage uses the same mechanism found on Nikon's professional F2, with some modern improvements designed to further reduce effects of vibration and mirror bounce. The FM2 also features Nikon's famous <b>close</b> <b>tolerance</b> assembly and minimal space lubrication, meaning that it will reliably operate in temperature extremes of −40 °C to +50 °C.|$|E
50|$|The {{impeller}} in a DGF pump {{is designed}} with dual sides. One side {{is designed to}} drive the liquid like a normal centrifugal pump {{and the other side}} is designed to draw vapor into the pump and mix it with the liquid. In addition to the new impeller, a special seal was invented to extend the life of the pump. With these innovations the pump creates a sub-atmospheric pressure region within the pump's seal chamber. As the impeller draws in the vapor it is mixed with the liquid being pumped and compressed into micro-fine bubbles. Because of the <b>close</b> <b>tolerance</b> between the backvanes of the impeller and the backplate of the pump the vapor is sheared into fine bubbles and then they are compressed in the sub-atmospheric pressure region of the pump. These fine bubbles become dissolved into the liquid within the volute of the pump.|$|E

50|$|Bramah {{was a very}} {{prolific}} inventor, {{though not}} all of his inventions were as important as his hydraulic press. They included: a beer engine (1797), a planing machine (1802), a paper-making machine (1805), a machine for automatically printing bank notes with sequential serial numbers (1806), and a fountain pen (1809). He also patented the first extrusion process for making lead pipes and also machinery for making gun stocks (Patent No. 2652).His greatest contribution to engineering was his insistence on quality control. He realised that for engines to succeed, {{they would have to}} be machined to a much better standard than was the practice. He taught Arthur Woolf to machine engines to a <b>close</b> <b>tolerance.</b> This enabled Cornish engines to run with high-pressure steam, vastly increasing their output. Woolf became the leading Cornish steam engineer and his designs were adopted by all the engine designers of the day. The 15-HP engines of Watt and others of circa 1800 gave way to 450-HP engines by 1835. Bramah {{can be viewed as a}} founding father in industrial quality control.|$|E
5000|$|A Vickers-type booster (the [...] "typical" [...] muzzle booster type) {{consists}} of two parts; {{the first is a}} flared [...] "cup" [...] on the muzzle of the barrel and the second is a perforated tube around the end of the muzzle, attached to {{the main body of the}} weapon, and with an end closed except for a small hole for the bullet to pass through. As the bullet exits the barrel, the expanding gases follow it into the chamber created between the cup and the shroud. As it passes through the <b>close</b> <b>tolerance</b> hole in the end of the perforated tube, it temporarily forms a blockage to further forward movement of the expanding gas from the barrel. The pressure inside the booster rises very rapidly as the gases continue to expand in the confined space (even after the bullet has cleared the hole, the gas pressure is still very high). The cup on the muzzle of the barrel provides a large, movable surface for the gas to push against, as it exerts force equally in all directions. As the outer shroud is fixed to the main frame of the gun, and only the barrel is movable, the pressure forces the cup and barrel to the rear, acting exactly as a piston in a cylinder. As the barrel cycles to the rear, the cup passes the perforations in the outer shroud, opening an escape path for the gases, immediately lowering the pressure, both reducing the harsh impact when the barrel reaches full recoil and preventing the remaining pressure from the gases from acting as a [...] "spring" [...] and slowing the barrel when it begins to travel forwards again (which would only slow the rate of fire). The barrel continues to the rear on its own momentum, and actuates the operating mechanism. The resulting action can be seen as a composite of the recoil action and a gas action — the barrel being acted upon as if it were the piston. Muzzle boosters in other weapons act in a similar fashion.|$|E
