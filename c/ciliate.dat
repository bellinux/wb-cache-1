5|$|Parasites of Theodoxus fluviatilis {{include several}} species of trematodes. The snail serves as first {{intermediate}} host to Plagioporus skrjabini and as second intermediate host to Cotylurus cornutus. Asymphylodora demeli {{is also found in}} this small snail, as is Notocotylus zduni. This small snail is also parasitized by {{several species of}} ciliates. It is the main host for the <b>ciliate</b> Trichodina baltica; the snails are usually 100% infected in the mantle cavity Another <b>ciliate</b> found in the mantle cavity is a species of Scyphidia. Two other parasitic <b>ciliate</b> species found in this snail are Protospira mazurica, and Hypocomella quatuor. Predators of Theodoxus fluviatilis include the common roach (a freshwater fish), Rutilus rutilus. Theodoxus fluviatilis is also the prey of some birds.|$|E

40|$|Cigarette smoke {{exposure}} {{is a major}} health hazard. <b>Ciliated</b> cells in the epithelium of the airway {{play a critical role}} in protection against the noxious effects of inhaled cigarette smoke. <b>Ciliated</b> cell numbers are reduced in smokers which weakens host defense and leads to disease. The mechanisms for the loss of <b>ciliated</b> cells are not well understood. The effects of whole cigarette smoke exposure on human airway <b>ciliated</b> <b>ciliated</b> cells were examined using in vitro cultures of normal human bronchial epithelial cells and a Vitrocell® VC 10 ® Smoking Robot. These experiments showed that whole cigarette smoke causes the loss of differentiated <b>ciliated</b> cells and inhibits differentiation of <b>ciliated</b> cells from undifferentiated basal cells. Furthermore, treatment with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Gefitinib, during smoke exposure prevents <b>ciliated</b> cell loss and promotes <b>ciliated</b> cell differentiation from basal cells. Finally, restoration of <b>ciliated</b> cells was inhibited after smoke exposure was ceased but was enhanced by Gefitinib treatment. These data suggest that inhibition of EGFR activity may provide therapeutic benefit for treating smoke related diseases...|$|R

5|$|Although predators of phoronids are {{not well}} known, they include fish, {{gastropods}} (snails), and nematodes (tiny roundworms). Phoronopsis viridis, which reaches densities of 26,500 per square meter on tidal flats in California (USA), is unpalatable to many epibenthic predators, including fish and crabs. The unpalatability is strongest in the top section, including the lophophore, which is exposed to predators when phoronids feed. When the lophophores were removed in an experiment, the phoronids were more palatable, but this effect reduced over 12 days as the lophophores regenerated. These broadly effective defenses, which appear unusual among invertebrates inhabiting soft sediment, may be important in allowing Phoronopsis viridis to reach high densities. Some parasites infest phoronids: progenetic metacercariae and cysts of trematodes in phoronids' coelomic cavities; unidentified gregarines in phoronids' digestive tract; and an ancistrocomid <b>ciliate</b> parasite, Heterocineta, in the tentacles.|$|E

25|$|Chilodonella uncinata is a {{single-celled}} organism of the <b>ciliate</b> {{class of}} alveoles. As a <b>ciliate,</b> C. uncinata has cilia covering its {{body and a}} dual nuclear structure, the micronucleus and macronucleus. Unlike some other ciliates, C. uncinata contains millions of minichromosomes (somatic chromosomes) in its macronucleus while its micronucleus is estimated to contain 3 chromosomes. Childonella uncinata is the causative agent of Chilodonelloza, a disease that affects the gills and skin of fresh water fish, and may act as a facilitative parasite of mosquito larva.|$|E
25|$|Internally {{eliminated}} sequences (IES) are noncoding {{regions of}} the germ-line genome found in Ciliates. They are defined as sections of DNA removed from the diploid micronuclear genome during which {{a copy of the}} micronuclear genome is converted to the macronuclear genome even though errors occur in which an IES sequence may not be deleted. There is little conservation of motifs between <b>Ciliate</b> species; however, C. uncinata, like other <b>ciliate</b> species, show a conserved IES sequence motif within a species. It is unknown if IES sequences have a function in the genome, but in the <b>ciliate</b> Paramecium, an IES sequence is used to determine the mating type of an individual. When a specific IES sequence is not deleted from the developing somatic nucleus, then it is type O mating type. However, if that IES is deleted from the developing macronucleus, it is type E mating type. Paramecium can only mate with individual of opposite mating type.|$|E

30|$|In this study, {{there was}} an {{important}} difference in <b>ciliates</b> abundance between years; on the other hand, the difference influences the <b>ciliates</b> composition and distribution. For example, in terms of annual scale, <b>ciliates</b> abundance peaked in summer 2009 and was 3 times more abundant than summer 2010. With regard to the structural composition, the <b>ciliates</b> community at Kneiss Islands coast was dominated by loricate <b>ciliates</b> (75 % of total <b>ciliates)</b> in summer 2009 and naked <b>ciliates</b> (56 % of total <b>ciliates)</b> in summer 2010. At the coastal waters around Kneiss Islands, loricate <b>ciliates</b> demonstrated a clear inter-annual pattern: high values in summer 2009 and low values in summer 2010 with an obvious peak in station 3 throughout the study period. Loricate <b>ciliates</b> counted for a large percentage (0 – 73 %) of the total <b>ciliates.</b> Their density seemed to be associated to their morphology that they can escape grazing due {{to the existence of}} a protective lorica (Abboud-Abi Saab 2008), their tolerance of marine habitats stress and high flexibility to eutrophic conditions. With regard to the structural composition, loricate <b>ciliates</b> population at the coast of Kneiss Islands was dominated by the genus Tintinnopsis. This genus has usually been reported to be the dominant planktonic <b>ciliates</b> in both temperate and tropical coastal systems (Dolan 2006). The most abundant species was Tintinnopsis beroidea; this species is relatively common in coastal ecosystems and in particular in the north coast (Rekik et al. 2015 b) and south coast (Rekik et al. 2015 c) of Sfax. The dominance of the agglutinated species T. beroidea appears {{to be related to the}} availability of particles to construct the lorica (Rakshit et al. 2015). This result suggests that this species performed better than other taxa probably owing to more flexible adaptive strategies, to particular environmental factors (temperature, salinity) and the shallowness of the water sampling (Kchaou et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|Cutaneous <b>ciliated</b> cyst was {{described}} as a painless cyst occurring on the lower limbs of {{women between the ages of}} 15 and 30 years. The cysts are typically lined by <b>ciliated</b> cuboidal to columnar epithelium with pseudostratified areas and focal squamous metaplasia is occasionally present. Immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated that the cysts are PR and ER positive, similar to the epithelia of the fallopian tubes. However, outliers of cutaneous <b>ciliated</b> cysts, including those in male patients and in unexpected locations such as the scalp, finger, and scapular area, have been reported. Thus, some hypotheses have been proposed including the Mullerian heterotopias, <b>ciliated</b> metaplasia of eccrine sweat glands, and embryonic remnants of the cloacal membrane. We report a rare case of cutaneous <b>ciliated</b> cyst on the left shoulder of a 7 -year-old boy and this is the eighth case of cutaneous <b>ciliated</b> cyst in male patients.

40|$|Disrupted <b>ciliated</b> {{epithelium}} shows slower ciliary {{beat frequency}} and increased dyskinesia B. Thomas, A. Rutman and C. O’Callaghan ABSTRACT: Ciliary function studies for {{the diagnosis of}} primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) are usually performed on nasal brush biopsy samples. It {{is not uncommon to}} find disrupted epithelial strips of tissue in these samples, and occasionally throughout a sample. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine if cilia on disrupted <b>ciliated</b> epithelial edges beat with a normal pattern and frequency similar to that of cilia on undisrupted edges. Nasal brush biopsy samples from 42 children in whom the diagnosis of PCD was excluded were assessed. The epithelial strips were categorised into five groups: intact undisrupted <b>ciliated</b> epithelial edge, <b>ciliated</b> epithelial edge with minor projections, <b>ciliated</b> epithelial edge with major projections, an isolated <b>ciliated</b> cell on an epithelial edge and single unattached <b>ciliated</b> cells. Ciliary beat frequency and beat pattern of 50 samples from each group were determined using high speed digital video microscopy. The cilia on epithelial edges with varying degrees of disruption showed significantly reduced beat frequency and significantly increased dyskinesia compared with those on intact, undisrupted <b>ciliated</b> epithelial edges. Ideally, the assessment of ciliary beat pattern and frequency for PCD diagnosis should only be performed on undisrupted <b>ciliated</b> edges...|$|R

25|$|Three {{types of}} leaves with differing {{morphology}} are present: cauline leaves, or those that {{appear on the}} stem {{from the middle of}} the plant upwards; basal leaves, or those that are present at the base of the plant; and distal leaves, which are those found on the extremities of the plant. All types are thin and sharply serrated with 6 to 15 pointed teeth per side. They are <b>ciliate,</b> meaning they have small hairy projections emerging from the margins of the leaf, while the apices, or tips of the leaves, are acuminate, meaning they taper to a point. The adaxial (i.e. upper) surfaces of the leaves are nearly hairless or sparsely hairy, while the abaxial (i.e. lower) surfaces are sparsely hairy with the veins being more villous, or covered in shaggy hairs.|$|E
