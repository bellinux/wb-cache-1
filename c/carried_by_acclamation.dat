60|$|The {{effect was}} electrical: the motion was <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> <b>acclamation</b> {{and there was}} a {{unanimous}} rush for the now wretched mariner whose false alarm at the masthead was the cause of our embarrassment, but on second thoughts it was decided to substitute Captain Troutbeck, as less generally useful and more undeviatingly in error. The sailor had made one mistake of considerable magnitude, but the captain's entire existence was a mistake altogether. He was fetched up from his cabin and chucked over.|$|E

Words and ideas seemed to flow more easily, and the letter was finally concluded, amid many sighs of relief, about bed-time.|$|E

The great boiler of the earth burst with a tremendous explosion, carrying away, as the thinnest part of the workmanship, not only Mr. John Jaw, and all his partisans, but forty thousand square miles of territory. The last that was seen of them was about thirty seconds after the occurrence of the explosion, when the whole mass disappeared near the northern horizon, going at a rate a little surpassing that of a cannon ball which has just left its gun." ...|$|E

6000|$|We were next favored with a {{discussion}} on the different significations of the word gorstchwzyb; which, rendered into English, means [...] "eh!" [...] The celebrated philologist who treated the subject, discovered amazing ingenuity in expatiating on its ramifications and deductions. First he tried the letters by transpositions, by which he triumphantly proved that it was derived from all the languages of the ancients; the same process showed that it possessed four thousand and two different significations; he next reasoned most ably and comprehensively for ten minutes, backwards and forwards, using no other word but this, applied in its various senses; after which, he incontrovertibly established that this important part of speech was so useful as to be useless, and he concluded by a proposition, in which the academy coincided by acclamation, {{that it should be}} forever and incontinently expunged from the Leaphigh vocabulary. As the vote was <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> <b>acclamation,</b> the king's cousin arose, and declared that the writer who should so far offend against good taste, as hereafter {{to make use of the}} condemned word, should have two inches cut off the extremity of his tail. A shudder among the ladies, who, I afterwards ascertained, loved to carry their caudae as high as our women like to carry their heads, proved the severity of the decree.|$|E

"Of Maria Theresa in Hungary,--for {{she ran to}} Presburg {{again with}} her woes (August 16th, Diet just {{assembling}} there),--let us say only that Hungary was again chivalrous; that old Palfy and the general Hungarian Nation answered in the old tone,--VIVAT MARIA; AD ARMA, AD ARMA! with Tolpatches, Pandours, Warasdins;--and, in short, that great and small, in infinite 'Insurrection,' have still a stroke of battle in them PRO REGE NOSTRO. Scarcely above a District or two (as the JASZERS and KAUERS, in their over-cautious way) making the least difficulty. Much enthusiasm and unanimity in all the others; {{here and there a}} Hungarian gentleman complaining scornfully that their troops, known as among the best fighters in Nature, are called irregular troops,--irregular, forsooth! In one public consultation [District not important, not very spellable, though doubtless pronounceable by natives to it], a gentleman suggests that 'Winter is near; should not there be some slight provision of tents, of shelter in the frozen sleety Mountains, to our gallant fellows bound thither?' Upon which another starts up, 'When our Ancestors came out of Asia Minor, over the Palus Maeotis bound in winter ice; and, sabre in hand, cut their way into this fine Country which is still ours, what shelter had they? No talk of tents, of barracks or accommodation there; each, wrapt in his sheep skin, found it shelter sufficient. Tents!'

5000|$|From {{the outset}} of his bishopric, Chavasse was {{determined}} to revive the project. There was some opposition among those rigorously evangelical members of his diocesan clergy who had earlier agreed with Ryle {{that there was no}} need for an expensive new cathedral. Chavasse did not regard evangelism as incompatible with the building of a great church as [...] "a visible witness to God in the midst of a great city". He pressed ahead, and appointed a committee under Sir William Forwood to consider all possible sites. Within a year a site had been chosen, and a public meeting chaired by Lord Derby officially launched the scheme. Chavasse made a powerful and effective speech, encouraging the citizens of Liverpool, [...] "We must build for posterity, we must take a leaf out of the book of our noble forefathers, who have handed down to us those great Cathedrals which are among the greatest heritages of the English nation". The proposal to build a cathedral was <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> <b>acclamation.</b> The young architect Giles Gilbert Scott was chosen to design the building. Work began in 1904, starting with the Lady Chapel, before building began on the huge main body of the cathedral.|$|E
50|$|In {{the mean}} time, the Representatives had met, early on 21 June 1815, and {{commenced}} their deliberations {{on the existing}} state of affairs. Marquis de Lafayette, the acknowledged Leader of the Liberal Party, having received intelligence of the subject of discussion in the Council, and aware that not a moment was to be lost in averting the blow with which their liberties were menaced, ascended the tribune, and addressed the Chamber, amidst the most profound silence, and breathless suspense: Representatives! For the first time during many years you hear a voice, which the old friends of liberty will yet recognize. I rise to address you concerning the dangers to which the country is exposed. The sinister reports which have been circulated {{during the last two}} days, are unhappily confirmed. This is the moment to rally round the national colours—the Tricoloured Standard of 1788—the standard of liberty, equality, and public order. It is you alone who can now protect the country from foreign attacks, and internal dissensions. It is you alone who can secure the independence and the honour of France.Permit a veteran in the sacred cause of liberty, in all times a stranger to the spirit of faction, to submit to you some resolutions which appear to him to be demanded by a sense of the public danger, and by the love of our country. They are such as, I feel persuaded, you will see the necessity of adopting:* I. The Chamber of Deputies declares that the independence of the nation is menaced.* II. The Chamber declares its sittings permanent. Any attempt to dissolve it, shall be considered high treason. Whosoever shall render himself culpable of such an attempt shall be considered a traitor to his country, and immediately treated as such.* III. The Army of the Line, and the National Guards, who have fought, and still fight, for the liberty, the independence, and the territory of France, have merited well of the country.* IV. The Minister of the Interior is invited to assemble the principal officers of the Parisian national Guard, in order to consult on the means of providing it with arms, and of completing this corps of citizens, whose tried patriotism and zeal offer a sure guarantee for the liberty, prosperity, and tranquillity of the capital, and for the inviolability of the national representatives.* V. The Ministers of War, of Foreign Affairs, of Police, and of the Interior are invited to repair immediately to the sittings of the Chamber. No one ventured to oppose these bold resolutions—The Imperialist Party was taken by surprise. The leading members were now elsewhere with Napoleon Bonaparte, and the others had not the courage to face the impending storm—and, after a brief discussion, in which their instant adoption was urged in the strongest manner, they were <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> <b>acclamation,</b> {{with the exception of the}} Fourth, which was suspended on account of the invidious distinction which it appeared to convey between the troops of the Line and the National Guards.|$|E

Mr. L. Rodway read a paper "On some New Botanical Specimens. " A paper from Mr. Weymouth on some New Mosses. Mr. J, B. Walker read a paper on " Abel Jansen Tasman : His Life and Times. " He said that for long Tasman was {{neglected}} by his own countrymen, but at this late date a good deal of close attention was being given to the existing records of his work. The Hon. Adye Douglas said the very admirable lecture they had just listened to was the last of the session. Their thanks were due to the vice-president, Sir James Agnew, and in moving that a vote of thanks be accorded him he would add the name of Mr. Barnard. Sir James Agnew and Mr. Barnard had belonged to the society for 54 years. The vote of thanks was <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> <b>acclamation,</b> and the recipients briefly responded. The Chairman announced that the evening's meeting closed the session for 1895. He was sure all would agree that many valuable papers had been read and much exceedingly useful information had been gathered and ventilated during the session of 1895. The meeting then terminated...|$|E
