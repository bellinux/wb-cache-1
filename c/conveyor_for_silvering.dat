50|$|Vertical lift {{conveyors}} contain two adjacent, parallel <b>conveyors</b> <b>for</b> simultaneous {{upward movement}} of adjacent {{surfaces of the}} parallel conveyors. One of the conveyors normally has spaced apart flites for transporting bulk food items. The dual conveyors rotate in opposite directions, but are operated from one gear box to ensure equal belt speed. One of the conveyors is pivotally hinged to the other <b>conveyor</b> <b>for</b> swinging the pivotally attached conveyor away from the remaining <b>conveyor</b> <b>for</b> access to the facing surfaces of the parallel conveyors. Vertical lift conveyors can be manually or automatically loaded and controlled. Almost all vertical conveyors can be systematically integrated with horizontal conveyors, since both of these conveyor systems work in tandem to create a cohesive material handling assembly line.|$|R
