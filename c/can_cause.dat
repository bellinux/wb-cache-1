5|$|As bikinis leave most of {{the body}} exposed to {{potentially}} dangerous UV radiation, overexposure <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> sunburn, skin cancer, {{as well as other}} acute and chronic health effects on the skin, eyes, and immune system. As a result, medical organizations recommend that bikini wearers protect themselves from UV radiation by using broad-spectrum sunscreen, which has been shown to protect against sunburn, skin cancer, wrinkling and sagging skin. Certain sunscreen ingredients <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> harm if they penetrate the skin over time.|$|E

5|$|Complications are {{distinct}} medical problems that may arise {{as a result}} of the TBI. The results of traumatic brain injury vary widely in type and duration; they include physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral complications. TBI <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> prolonged or permanent effects on consciousness, such as coma, brain death, persistent vegetative state (in which patients are unable to achieve a state of alertness to interact with their surroundings), and minimally conscious state (in which patients show minimal signs of being aware of self or environment). Lying still for long periods <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> complications including pressure sores, pneumonia or other infections, progressive multiple organ failure, and deep venous thrombosis, which <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> pulmonary embolism. Infections that can follow skull fractures and penetrating injuries include meningitis and abscesses. Complications involving the blood vessels include vasospasm, in which vessels constrict and restrict blood flow, the formation of aneurysms, in which the side of a vessel weakens and balloons out, and stroke.|$|E
5|$|Epiphenomenalism is a {{doctrine}} first formulated by Thomas Henry Huxley. It {{consists of the}} view that mental phenomena are causally ineffectual, where one or more mental states {{do not have any}} influence on physical states or mental phenomena are the effects, but not the causes, of physical phenomena. Physical events <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> other physical events and physical events <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> mental events, but mental events cannot cause anything, since they are just causally inert by-products (i.e. epiphenomena) of the physical world. This view has been defended most strongly in recent times by Frank Jackson.|$|E

5|$|In acute poisoning, typical {{neurological}} {{signs are}} pain, muscle weakness, numbness and tingling, and, rarely, symptoms associated with {{inflammation of the}} brain. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation are other acute symptoms. Lead's effects on the mouth include astringency and a metallic taste. Gastrointestinal problems, such as constipation, diarrhea, poor appetite, or weight loss, are common in acute poisoning. Absorption of large amounts of lead over a short time <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> shock (insufficient fluid in the circulatory system) due to loss {{of water from the}} gastrointestinal tract. Hemolysis (the rupture of red blood cells) due to acute poisoning <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> anemia and hemoglobin in the urine. Damage to kidneys <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> changes in urination such as decreased urine output. People who survive acute poisoning often go on to display symptoms of chronic poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Infection {{with the}} {{bacteria}} Helicobacter bilis and Helicobacter hepaticus species <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> biliary cancer.|$|E
25|$|A {{neoplasm}} <b>can</b> be <b>caused</b> by {{an abnormal}} proliferation of tissues, which <b>can</b> be <b>caused</b> by genetic mutations. Not {{all types of}} neoplasms cause a tumorous overgrowth of tissue, however (such as leukemia or carcinoma in situ).|$|R
50|$|The exact {{mechanism}} of HIV-associated lipodystrophy {{is not fully}} elucidated.

5|$|Molybdenum dusts and fumes, {{generated}} by mining or metalworking, can be toxic, especially if ingested (including dust {{trapped in the}} sinuses and later swallowed). Low levels of prolonged exposure <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> irritation to the eyes and skin. Direct inhalation or ingestion of molybdenum and its oxides should be avoided. OSHA regulations specify the maximum permissible molybdenum exposure in an 8-hour day as 5mg/m3. Chronic exposure to 60 to 600mg/m3 <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> symptoms including fatigue, headaches and joint pains. At levels of 5000mg/m3, molybdenum is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|Once in space, sudden {{exposure}} of unprotected humans to very low pressure, such as during a rapid decompression, <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> pulmonary barotraumaâ€”a rupture of the lungs, {{due to the}} large pressure differential between {{inside and outside the}} chest. Even if the subject's airway is fully open, the flow of air through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the rupture. Rapid decompression can rupture eardrums and sinuses, bruising and blood seep can occur in soft tissues, and shock <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> an increase in oxygen consumption that leads to hypoxia.|$|E
