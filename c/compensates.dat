40|$|The {{quality of}} medical imaging is an {{important}} factor that can directly aﬀect on the results of diﬀerent medical imaging tests which routinely being used for various clinical studies and related research. The existence of any type of image imperfection such as diﬀerent noise and artifacts can make some diﬃculties for the correct analyzing and consequent interpretation of medical imaging test results and even may impact on the overall decision of the performed clinical procedure. Due to this issue, there is always a motivation for the quality enhancement of medical imaging {{that needs to be done}} by correcting for the diﬀerent image degradation that typically arise during medical image capture or reconstruction. Computational <b>compensated</b> imaging provides a useful, cheap and easy solution for the quality enhancement of diﬀerent types of medical imaging when it compares to the similar hardware-based compensation methods. A computational <b>compensated</b> medical imaging basically aims to recover a <b>compensated</b> (true) image from degraded medical measurement that is aﬀected by the diﬀerent types of acquisition/reconstruction image degradation. <b>Compensating</b> for each single image degradation issue can be useful for the quality improvement of medical imaging. Having a computational <b>compensated</b> imaging framework to jointly correct for multiple acquisition/reconstruction degradation issues can improve the functionality of current existing <b>compensated</b> imaging frameworks as they mostly account only for a single speciﬁc type of degradation issue. This work presents a novel probabilistic based computational <b>compensated</b> medical imaging which is able to jointly account for several acquisition/reconstruction degradation issues from the diﬀerent domains in a uniﬁed computational framework. The developed computational cross-domain <b>compensated</b> medical imaging speciﬁcally takes advantage of a stochastically fully connected conditional random ﬁeld (SFC-CRF) model in its frame- work which improves the performance of the proposed <b>compensated</b> medical imaging in producing of a desired <b>compensated</b> medical image. A <b>compensated</b> optical coherence tomography (C-OCT) imaging is developed within the framework of proposed computational cross-domain <b>compensated</b> medical imaging and with aiming to jointly <b>compensate</b> for the degradation due to the optical aberrations and speckle noise in OCT imaging. The developed C-OCT imaging is expanded to design a <b>compensated</b> super resolution OCT (C-SR-OCT) imaging framework which is able to generate a super resolution OCT (SR-OCT) image of higher quality from multiple OCT measurements. The proposed computational cross-domain <b>compensated</b> medical imaging is also used to develop a <b>compensated</b> magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) framework which aims to improve the quality of MR imaging from diﬀerent modalities by jointly correcting for the MR image degradation due to the intrinsic properties of MR scanner, bias ﬁeld inhomogeneities and inherent MR noise. The results of all three designed <b>compensated</b> medical imaging platforms for the OCT imaging and MR imaging elaborate the promising eﬃcacy of proposed probabilistic based computational <b>compensated</b> medical imaging framework for the quality enhancement of diﬀerent medical imaging techniques...|$|R

5|$|In {{contrast}} to extracellular fluid, cytosol {{has a high}} concentration of potassium ions and a low concentration of sodium ions. This difference in ion concentrations is critical for osmoregulation, since if the ion levels were the same inside a cell as outside, water would enter constantly by osmosis - since the levels of macromolecules inside cells are higher than their levels outside. Instead, sodium ions are expelled and potassium ions taken up by the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, potassium ions then flow down their concentration gradient through potassium-selection ion channels, this loss of positive charge creates a negative membrane potential. To balance this potential difference, negative chloride ions also exit the cell, through selective chloride channels. The loss of sodium and chloride ions <b>compensates</b> for the osmotic effect of the higher concentration of organic molecules inside the cell.|$|E

If White blocks the check with Nb1–c3 then Black should capture the knight only if White is forced to take back with the pawn, after which the isolated, doubled pawns are a positional advantage for Black that fully <b>compensates</b> the loss of the bishop pair, and even the gambitted pawn. Due to its immunity to pawn attacks, the c5-square may be used by Black as a stronghold for his pieces. Piece exchanges can be good for Black even if he is a pawn down, as he can hope to exploit the crippled pawn structure in the ending. On the other hand, if White can recapture with a piece, the trade on c3 typically concedes the bishop pair for insufficient compensation.|$|E
5|$|In {{standard}} {{models of}} international trade a fall {{in the price of}} a country's export good – a deterioration in its terms of trade – generally decreases the home country's welfare. In the Brander–Spencer model however the opposite is true. This is because in this model the markets are not perfectly competitive and the revenue from the expanded quantity sold <b>compensates</b> the firm for the revenue lost from the lower export price. If the good produced by the firm is also consumed domestically however the result is a bit more complicated. In the case where the firm is able to separate the home and export market (charge different prices in each with no possibility of third party arbitrage) then the level of the optimal subsidies will depend on whether marginal costs of production are constant, increasing or decreasing. The optimal subsidy level is either the same, higher or lower, respectively, compared to the level with no domestic consumption. This underscores the need {{on the part of the}} government for very precise information on industry structure and firm's cost functions.|$|E
5|$|Non-disabled sprinters have {{calves and}} ankles that return and amplify the energy {{supplied}} by their hips and knees, while Pistorius <b>compensates</b> with additional work {{because he does}} not have calves and ankles with their associated tendons and muscles. An analysis published by Engineering & Technology magazine estimates that in using the blades, Pistorius must generate twice the power from his gluteal and quadriceps muscles that a normal sprinter would. Other sources also credit core abdominal muscles and a faster arm swing. His trainer estimates that about 85 percent of his power comes from his hips and the rest from his knees. This results in a gait that waddles slightly, as Pistorius swings his upper body to balance the springing action of the blades. The blades compress under his weight, then release as he moves forward, providing forward thrust from the tips as they return to their molded shape. As they spring off, he swings them slightly out to the side and throws them forward for the next stride.|$|E

5|$|The {{symptoms}} {{produced by}} AVMs {{in the liver}} depend {{on the type of}} abnormal connection that they form between blood vessels. If the connection is between arteries and veins, a large amount of blood bypasses the body's organs, for which the heart <b>compensates</b> by increasing the cardiac output. Eventually congestive cardiac failure develops ("high-output cardiac failure"), with breathlessness and leg swelling among other problems. If the AVM creates a connection between the portal vein and the blood vessels of the liver, the result may be portal hypertension (increased portal vein pressure), in which collateral blood vessels form in the esophagus (esophageal varices), which may bleed violently; furthermore, the increased pressure may give rise to fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity (ascites). If the flow in the AVM is in the other direction, portal venous blood flows directly into the veins rather than running through the liver; this may lead to hepatic encephalopathy (confusion due to portal waste products irritating the brain). Rarely, the bile ducts are deprived of blood, leading to severe cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts). Liver AVMs are detectable in over 70% of people with HHT, but only 10% experience problems as a result.|$|E

5|$|When {{thermoplastics}} are moulded, typically pelletised {{raw material}} is fed through a hopper into a heated barrel with a reciprocating screw. Upon {{entrance to the}} barrel, the temperature increases and the Van der Waals forces that resist relative flow of individual chains are weakened {{as a result of}} increased space between molecules at higher thermal energy states. This process reduces its viscosity, which enables the polymer to flow with the driving force of the injection unit. The screw delivers the raw material forward, mixes and homogenises the thermal and viscous distributions of the polymer, and reduces the required heating time by mechanically shearing the material and adding a significant amount of frictional heating to the polymer. The material feeds forward through a check valve and collects {{at the front of the}} screw into a volume known as a shot. A shot is the volume of material that is used to fill the mould cavity, compensate for shrinkage, and provide a cushion (approximately 10% of the total shot volume, which remains in the barrel and prevents the screw from bottoming out) to transfer pressure from the screw to the mould cavity. When enough material has gathered, the material is forced at high pressure and velocity into the part forming cavity. To prevent spikes in pressure, the process normally uses a transfer position corresponding to a 95–98% full cavity where the screw shifts from a constant velocity to a constant pressure control. Often injection times are well under 1 second. Once the screw reaches the transfer position the packing pressure is applied, which completes mould filling and <b>compensates</b> for thermal shrinkage, which is quite high for thermoplastics relative to many other materials. The packing pressure is applied until the gate (cavity entrance) solidifies. Due to its small size, the gate is normally the first place to solidify through its entire thickness. Once the gate solidifies, no more material can enter the cavity; accordingly, the screw reciprocates and acquires material for the next cycle while the material within the mould cools so that it can be ejected and be dimensionally stable. This cooling duration is dramatically reduced by the use of cooling lines circulating water or oil from an external temperature controller. Once the required temperature has been achieved, the mould opens and an array of pins, sleeves, strippers, etc. are driven forward to demould the article. Then, the mould closes and the process is repeated.|$|E
