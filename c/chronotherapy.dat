40|$|The {{occurrence}} of the clinical manifestations of ischemic heart disease (IHD) [...] myocardial ischemia and angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death [...] is unevenly distributed during the 24 h with greater than expected events during the initial hours of the daily activity span and {{in the late afternoon}} or early evening. Such temporal patterns result from circadian rhythms in pathophysiological mechanisms plus cyclic environmental stressors that trigger ischemic events. Both the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of many, though not all, anti-ischemic oral nitrate, calcium channel blocker, and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist medications {{have been shown to be}} influenced by the circadian time of their administration. The requirement for preventive and therapeutic interventions varies predictably during the 24 h, and thus therapeutic strategies should also be tailored accordingly to optimize outcomes. During the past decade, two first generation calcium channel blocker <b>chronotherapies</b> have been developed, trialed, and marketed in North America for the improved treatment of IHD. Nonetheless, there has been relatively little investigation of the administration-time (circadian rhythm) dependencies of the PK and PD of conventional anti-ischemic medications, and there has been little progress in the development of new generation IHD <b>chronotherapies.</b> Available epidemiologic, pharmacologic, and clinico-therapeutic evidence demonstrates how the chronobiologic approach to IHD can contribute new insight and opportunities to improve drug design and drug delivery to enhance therapeutic outcomes...|$|R

In some cases of OCD, the expression of affective, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms {{may be influenced by}} circadian and seasonal rhythms, and this could possibly interact with other neurophysiological factors. Further work is required to characterize circadian profiles linked to OCD, but findings thus far highlighted delays in both the sleep–wake cycle and melatonin secretion, as well as reduced circadian rhythmicity of body temperature. It is proposed that these changes in behavioral and endogenous rhythms may increase one’s vulnerability to obsessive–compulsive symptoms. Accordingly, obsessive–compulsive symptoms appear to be more severe in individuals with lower circadian amplitude and often worsen in the afternoon and evening. An increasing number of studies reported encouraging outcomes following the integration of sleep and circadian-based treatments in the management of OCD.

50|$|Familial {{advanced}} sleep-phase syndrome {{known to}} be associated with mutations in the mammalian Per2 gene. People suffering from the disorder have a shorter period and advanced phase where they go to sleep in the early evening (around 7pm) and wake up before sunrise (around 4am). In 2006, a lab in Germany identified particular phosphorylated residues of PER2 that are mutated in people suffering of FASPS. <b>Chronotherapy</b> is sometimes used as a treatment, as an attempt to alter the phase of the individual's clock using cycles of bright light.|$|E
50|$|Treatment of {{the delayed}} sleep phase type {{depends on the}} {{severity}} of the case. Mild cases may be addressed by an individual simply adhering to strict sleep and wake times. Severe cases may require incremental changes in sleep time, where a person sleeps 15 to 30 minutes earlier each day until an appropriate pattern is reached. Other methods of altering delayed sleep patterns include prescribing a night of sleep deprivation or the use of <b>chronotherapy,</b> a method in which sleep is delayed for three hours each night until the sleep pattern is rotated around the clock.|$|E

CancerIn this area the network uses computer models of the cell cycle and of its coupling to the 24 h day-and-night rhythm to improve the treatment of patients with cancer. The use of <b>chronotherapy</b> implies that the administration of anti-cancer drugs is adjusted in accordance with the circadian rhythm of the patient. For certain forms of cancer this has been found to increase the efficiency of the drug by a factor of five. Efforts are also devoted to the development of new anti-cancer drugs. Hypertension and cardiovascular diseasesActivities area focus on the development of 3D heart models {{that can be used to}} test how a new drug affects the regularity of the heart rhythm. Work is performed to develop detailed models of the mechanisms by which the individual nephron of the kidney regulates the incoming blood flow and how neighboring nephrons interact. Mental disorders and neuronal systemsWork includes application of mathematical models to develop less invasive and demand-controlled electrical stimulation techniques for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Modelling studies are performed to examine the effect of sleep deprivation in the treatment of depression, and bioinformatic approaches are applied to try to identify forms of depression on the basis of the information available from blood samples. Methodological issuesThe area encompasses description of complex networks of oscillating biological units, studies of the mechanisms of temperature stabilization in biological feedback regulations, application of new methods of data analysis, and development of modeling software and biomedical search machines. The area includes application of new experimental techniques such as interference microscopy and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy to study cellular processes. Regulatory issues and dialogue with the publicTesting in animal and human subjects is a necessary part of the development of new drugs. Such experiments clearly raises a number of complicated ethical issues that the use of simulation models may reduce. This requires that the regulatory authorities can evaluate computer models and accept them as part of the required documentation.

40|$|Dix pagesInternational audienceBACKGROUND: Circadian rhythm {{disruption}} {{was linked}} to high serum levels of Transforming Growth Factor Receptor α, an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) ligand and poor survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We hypothesized that EGFR blockade with cetuximab would enhance the activity of <b>chronotherapy</b> {{as a result of}} improved circadian coordination. METHODS: All the patients with mCRC referred to our unit for progression on prior chemotherapy over a 30 -month-period received weekly cetuximab and fortnightly <b>chronotherapy.</b> RESULTS: Fifty-six patients were treated with a median of six courses of fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy and irinotecan (61 %), oxaliplatin (25 %) or both (14 %) after a median of three prior regimens. We found no EFGR amplification by FISH in the tumor of 27 consecutive patients. Acneiform rash and diarrhea were the most common toxicities. Objective response rate was 32. 1 % and positively correlated with rash grade (p = 0. 025). None of the responders had K-Ras mutation in their tumor. Median progression-free and overall survival were 4. 6 and 13. 7 months, respectively. Complete macroscopic resections of metastases in liver, lung or other abdominopelvic sites were performed following tumor downstaging by the treatment regimen in 11 patients (21 %), 8 of whom being alive at 3 years. These figures are twice as high as those reported for first-line combination of cetuximab with conventional chemotherapy or for third line <b>chronotherapy.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The addition of cetuximab to <b>chronotherapy</b> allowed safe and effective therapeutic control of metastases, including their complete resection, despite previous failure of several treatment regimens...|$|E

40|$|Morning {{symptoms}} of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) {{are linked to}} circadian increase of night inflammation, supported by inadequate cortisol secretion in active disease. Therefore, exogenous glucocorticoid administration in RA is recommended by EULAR and ACR {{from the beginning of}} the diagnosis, since may partially act like a "replacement therapy". In addition, the prevention/treatment of the night up-regulation of the immune/inflammatory reaction has been shown more effective when exogenous glucocorticoid administration is managed with a night-Time-release formulation. Despite a considerably higher cost than conventional prednisone (immediate release), <b>chronotherapy</b> with night-Time-release prednisone has been recognized a cost-effective option for RA patients not on glucocorticoids who are eligible for therapy with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Interestingly, since different cell populations involved in the inflammatory process are particularly activated during the night (i. e. monocytes, macrophages), other therapeutical approaches used in RA, such as conventional DMARDs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should follow the same concepts of glucocorticoid <b>chronotherapy.</b> Therefore, bedtime methotrexate <b>chronotherapy</b> was found to better manage RA symptoms, and several available NSAIDs (i. e. indomethacin, aceclofenac, ketoprofen, flurbiprofen, lornoxicam) have been recently modified in their formulation, in order to obtain more focused night action...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} the <b>chronotherapy</b> of hypertension. Chronotherapeutics is the purposeful timing of medications, {{whether or not}} they utilize special drug-release technology, to proportion their serum and tissue concentrations in synchrony with known circadian rhythms in disease processes and symptoms as a means of enhancing beneficial outcomes and/or attenuating or averting adverse effects (Smolensky and Haus, 2001). The concept of chronotherapeutics, although relatively new to hypertension and cardiovascular medicine, was first introduced and proven worthy in clinical medicine in the 1960 s; the morning alternate-day corticosteroid tablet dosing schedule was introduced as a convenient means of minimizing the adverse effects of such anti-inflammatory medications as prednisone and methylprednisolone (Harter et al., 1963; Reinberg, 1989). The <b>chronotherapy</b> of hypertension takes into account the clinically relevant features of the 24 h pattern of blood pressure (BP), e. g., the accelerated morning rise at the commencement of diurnal activity and the extent of decline during nighttime sleep, plus potential administration-time (circadian rhythm) determinants of the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of individual antihypertensive medications.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} {{on how to}} best tailor blood pressure (BP) -lowering medications according to the circadian (24 h) BP pattern of individual patients, that is, <b>chronotherapy.</b> Significant and clinically meaningful treatment-time differences in the beneficial and/or adverse effects of at least six different classes of hypertension medications are now known. Generally, calcium channel blockers are more effective with bedtime than morning dosing, {{and in the case}} of dihydropyridine derivatives bedtime dosing significantly reduces the risk of edema. Scheduling angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors at bedtime, as opposed to awakening, increases the proportion of patients with properly controlled BP, enhances the sleep-time relative BP decline towards a normal dipping pattern and best reduces urinary albumin excretion, a marker of functional renal status. The <b>chronotherapy</b> of conventional BP-lowering medications entails their correct scheduling with reference to the body's circadian rhythms, not only to achieve control of daytime and night-time systolic and diastolic BP but to normalize the dipping status of the 24 h pattern. <b>Chronotherapy</b> constitutes a cost-effective strategy for enhancing BP control during both nocturnal sleep and daytime activity and for potentially reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and end-organ injury of the blood vessels and tissue of the heart, brain, kidney, eye and other organs...|$|E
