40|$|The Medial Axis Transform MAT {{was defined}} by Blum as an {{alternate}} description of {{the shape of a}} continuous object. The MAT is the closure of the set of centers of maximal balls which can fit inside the object. A ball is maximal if it is not contained by any other such ball. This model provides dimensionality reduction, completness, it is homotopic with the object characteristics and it is continuous if the object is path-connected. In many applications of 2 D digital image processing, discrete approximations of the MAT, such as skeletal representations, thinning, morphological and Distance Map based methods. The main drawback of these methods is that they do not keep up all properties of the <b>continuous</b> <b>MAT</b> simultaneously.

40|$|The {{nature of}} the full-glacial {{vegetation}} of Beringia {{has been the subject}} of a great deal of investigation and debate. Here we present a reconstruction of an intact example of the full-glacial upland vegetation of part of the northern Seward Peninsula at one point in time. The area was blanketed by more than 1 m of tephra ca. 18, 000 14 C BP (ca. 21, 500 cal. BP), and the former land-surface was preserved in the permafrost. The discovery of the land-surface provides a unique opportunity to study a fossil ecosystem preserved in situ. Macrofossils were used to reconstruct the vegetation growing at several sites on the buried land-surface. The macrofossil assemblages indicate a vegetation characterized by graminoids and forbs, with the occasional occurrence of Salix arctica. The vegetation was dominated by Kobresia myosuroides, other sedges (Carex), and grasses, with a "ne-scale mosaic related to snow accumulation and moisture availability. Overall, the vegetation was a closed, dry, herb-rich tundra-grassland with a continuous moss layer, growing on calcareous soil that was continuously supplied with loess. Nutrient renewal by loess deposition was probably responsible for the relatively fertile vegetation, and the occurrence of a <b>continuous</b> <b>mat</b> of acrocarpous mosses. Good physiognomic analogues can be suggested, but no exact modern vegetational analogues have been found, probably because the full-glacial environment and climate with loess deposition do not occur today.

40|$|Wool {{scouring}} is {{the first}} stage of wool processing, where unwanted contaminants are removed from freshly shorn wool. In most scouring machines wool is fed as a <b>continuous</b> <b>mat</b> through a series of water-filled scour and rinse bowls which are periodically drained. The purpose of this project is to mathematically model the scour bowl with the aim of improving efficiency. In this thesis four novel models of contaminant concentration within a scour bowl are developed. These are used to investigate the relationships between the operating parameters of the machine and the concentration of contamination within the scour bowl. The models use the advection-diffusion equation to simulate the settling and mixing of contamination. In the first model considered here, the scour bowl is simulated numerically using finite difference methods. Previous models of the scouring process only considered the average steady-state concentration of contamination within the entire scour bowl. This {{is the first}} wool scouring model to look at the bowl in two dimensions and to give time dependent results, hence allowing the effect of different drainage patterns to be studied. The second model looks at the important region {{at the top of the}} bowl - where the wool and water mix. The governing equations are solved analytically by averaging the concentration vertically assuming the wool layer is thin. Asymptotic analysis on this model reveals some of the fundamental behaviour of the system. The third model considers the same region by solving the governing equations through separation of variables. A fourth, fully two-dimensional, time dependent model was developed and solved using a finite element method. A model of the swelling of grease on the wool fibres is also considered since some grease can only be removed from the fibre once swollen. The swelling is modelled as a Stefan problem, a nonlinear diffusion equation with two moving boundaries, in cylindrical coordinates. Both approximate, analytical and a numerical solutions are found...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} study of the {{flexural}} behaviour and resultant failure modes in E-glass/polyester pultruded composites. The digital image correlation (DIC) method is used to estimate the effect of fibre orientation on failure behaviour in thick beams, taking into account the presence of <b>continuous</b> filament <b>mat</b> layer (CFM) in the stacking sequence. In particular, the tests were carried out for specimens with off-axis angle of 0 °, 7. 5 °, 15 °, 30 °, 45 ° and 90 °. The crack initiation and the failure mechanisms depend on the mutual interaction between the stiffness properties of different areas in the stacking sequence. An influence index (I) was introduced to evaluate the magnitude of these phenomena. For small orientation angle (i. e. less than 7. 5 °), the failure mechanism is not influenced by the central mat layer and the crack starts from the tension region. For angles between 15 ° and 45 °, the influence of the central mat layer is predominant and delamination occurs at the interface between the mat layer and the adjacent one. For 90 ° angles, the CFM layer does not influence the typical fracture mechanism and transverse matrix cracking occurs...|$|R

The modeling framework is demonstrated for multi-layered composite systems {{consisting of two}} alternating fiber-reinforced polymeric layers: unidirectional fiber (roving) and <b>continuous</b> filament <b>mat</b> (CFM). The viscoelastic behavior of the polymeric matrix is considered as stress-dependent and thermo-rheologically complex. Two simplified 3 D micromechanical models with periodic boundary conditions are formulated for the roving and CFM. In addition, a sublaminate model is developed for the 3 D effective homogenized through-thickness response of the roving and CFM layers.

Stress correction algorithms are developed at each scale to enhance computational efficiency and accuracy. Short-term (30 min) creep tests on off-axis multi-layered specimens are also conducted under combined stresses and temperatures to calibrate in-situ fiber and matrix properties and verify the predictions of the multi-scale framework.

Off-axis coupons were cut with different roving orientations in order to generate in-plane multi-axial stress states. The nonlinear axial stress–strain curves of the off-axis tests are compared with the predicted curves from the three proposed models. Good agreement is shown for all off-axis angles when comparing the experimental stress–strain curves with those predicted by the 3 D micromodel.

With application of the pultrusion method, the manufacture of large-scale profiles with various cross-section forms became potentially possible with relatively low costs. Usually two different technological approaches are available to realize the element: in the first one a mat-roving-mat sequence is adopted, in the second one only roving is present. <b>Continuous</b> filament <b>mat</b> (CFM, fibers distributed randomly in all directions) is often used to build up laminate thickness quickly, as well as to enhance transversal strength and stiffness. Besides, the intrinsic particular features of GFRP materials require the application of new techniques of mechanical analysis to define a correct material model. Many papers study the mechanical behavior of GFRP structural elements at a macroscopic scale even in particular environmental conditions. From the other hand full-field contactless techniques (e. g. digital image correlation, thermal stress analysis, speckle interferometry) are effective tools to correctly model complex mechanical behavior and to define the consequent parameters.

Two sites in the intermediate zone of the estuary were chosen: a northern one at Bagliardi Beach (34 ° 55 ′S, 57 ° 47 ′W), where the golden mussel was initially found in 1991 and where previous research on the population ecology was conducted, and a southern one at Punta Indio (35 ° 16 ′S, 57 ° 13 ′W), the southernmost limit of the species' distribution in South America and an area that experiences environmental-salinity stress. Both sites were also chosen because of the accessibility to the estuary's shore. The macrotopography is similar between sites, and they are located 90  km apart (Figure  1). At both sites, hard substrates were scarce, but a few compact granite rocks were present that had irregular surfaces and were similar in size (ca. 18, 000  cm 3), either stacked at Bagliardi Beach or scattered over a smooth slope at Punta Indio. The scarcity of hard natural substrates in the Río de la Plata Estuary had previously prevented the development of sessile or sedentary fauna until human activities began to change the coastline through creating docks and placing boulders. The latter rocks are usually used for shoreline defense and were installed by the authorities to prevent flooding under extraordinary tidal and wind conditions. Hard substrates are directly influenced by the sun (insolation) during low tides and {{are exposed to the}} mechanical action of waves at high tides (Wells and Daborn 1997). Waves are usually small (average height, 0.31  m) in the intermediate zone of the estuary, while the largest ones occur in the external zone and the smallest ones in the inner zone (Guerrero et al. 1997). Bagliardi Beach is surrounded by a long stretch of soft sand and silt, whereas the beaches around Punta Indio are composed of mud and silty clay. The hard substrates at both sites are stable and occupied by L. fortunei; it is non-indigenous and forms monospecific mussel beds. The barnacle Balanus improvisus (Darwin 1854) is the other sedentary species that is present at Punta Indio, although in much lower abundances than the golden mussel (pers. observ.); this beach constitutes the northern limit of the distribution of B. improvisus along the Argentine coastline. This barnacle was more frequently found attached to L. fortunei shells than in <b>continuous</b> <b>mats</b> on the substrate. The rocky littoral zone of the Río de la Plata Estuary does not display the classical zonation scheme characterized by different sessile species exhibited by several estuaries and marine ecosystems (Stephenson and Stephenson 1949), principally because of the river's extremely low slope and extensive beaches along its banks (Wells and Daborn 1997). The Río de la Plata Estuary has an intertidal region that is essentially defined by the respective values for mean low water, mean tidal range, and mean tide level of 0.52, 0.52, and 0.79  m at Bagliardi Beach, and 0.48, 0.68, and 0.85  m at Punta Indio (SHN 2001); these two sites are located at the borders of the estuary's intermediate salinity zone of 0.3 to 5 psu (see “Background”).|$|R
40|$|A key {{unanswered}} {{question that}} must be addressed before polymeric composites will be widely used in automotive structural components is their known durability. Major durability issues are the effects that cyclic loadings, creep, automotive fluid environments, and low-energy impacts have on dimensional stability, strength, and stiffness throughout the required life of a composite component. This report reviews the current state of understanding in each of these areas. It also discusses the limited information that exists on one of the prime candidate materials for automotive structural applications [...] an isocyanurate reinforced with a <b>continuous</b> strand, swirl <b>mat.</b> Because of the key role that nondestructive evaluations must play in understanding damage development and progression, a chapter is included on ultrasonic techniques. A final chapter then gives conclusions and recommendations for research needed to resolve the various durability issues. These recommendations will help provide a sound basis for program planning for the Durability of Lightweight Composite Structures Project sponsored by the US Department of Energy in cooperation with the Automotive Composites Consortium of Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors...|$|R
40|$|ABSIXACT: This paper {{describes}} an experimental {{study on the}} tensile creep behavior of a random <b>continuous</b> fiber <b>mat</b> reinforced polypropylene composite, commercially known as Azdel. A special experimental setup was designed and used to conduct these creep tests at 75 and 100 °C with stress levels ranging from 30 to 60 percent of the tensile strength of Azdel. The test duration was 3, 000 hours or the time to creep rupture response, whichever occurred first. A straight line on a semi-log plot adequately described the rela-tionship between the imposed stress and the creep rupture response time for the range of stress levels studied. Moreover, the estimated secondary creep mte was inversely related to the observed creep rupture response time. INTRODUCI'ION ELEcriNG COMPOSITE MATERIALS for long term applications at elevated S temperatures requires knowledge of their creep behavior. In creep tests, a constant stress is applied on the specimen and the strain is measured {{as a function of}} time. The increase in strain with time is known as creep. Depending on the stress level and ambient temperature, the specimen can also fail, thereby termi-nating the creep test. This fidure phenomenon is known as creep rupture and oc-curs at stresses much lower than the static tensile strength of the material. Creep behavior of composite materials has been studied only to a limited ex-tent, mainly {{due to the fact that}} continuous fiber composites in thermosetting ma-trices do not exhibit large creep strains at their use temperature 111. However, creep deformation may be relatively large if the fiber orientation is random and/or the matrix is a thermoplastic resin. There are a few reported studies on the creep characteristics of random fiber sheet molding compound (SMC-R) com-posites [2 - 3]. In these studies, the matrix was a thermosetting resin, such a...|$|R
