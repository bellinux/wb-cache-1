5|$|Also {{named after}} him is the Champollion <b>crater,</b> a lunar <b>crater</b> {{on the far side}} of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|On February 15, NASA {{scientists}} {{identified the}} <b>crater</b> formed by Deep Impact in images from Stardust. The <b>crater</b> {{is estimated to}} be 150 meters (500ft) in diameter, and has a bright mound in the center likely created when material from the impact fell back into the <b>crater.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shackleton is {{an impact}} <b>crater</b> that {{lies at the}} south pole of the Moon. The peaks along the crater's rim are exposed to almost continual sunlight, while the {{interior}} is perpetually in shadow (a <b>Crater</b> of eternal darkness). The low-temperature interior of this <b>crater</b> functions as a cold trap that may capture and freeze volatiles shed during comet impacts on the Moon. Measurements by the Lunar Prospector spacecraft showed higher than normal amounts of hydrogen within the <b>crater,</b> which may indicate the presence of water ice. The <b>crater</b> is named after Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton.|$|E
40|$|The Apollo 16 crew photographed {{an unusual}} variety of impact <b>craters,</b> {{including}} the two <b>craters</b> {{produced by the}} impacts of Ranger 7 and 9 spacecraft, small <b>craters</b> produced by boulders as they bounced downslope, <b>craters</b> with marked bilateral symmetry, and primary <b>craters</b> {{with a wide range}} of morphologies and sizes. Ranger impact <b>craters</b> and examples of other <b>craters</b> are briefly discussed. This photography has supplied important new data on <b>craters</b> in the lunar surface. Continued study of these <b>craters</b> and use of the metrical capabilities of the metric and panoramic camera photography will yield additional scientific results on lunar <b>craters...</b>|$|R
50|$|Martian <b>craters</b> are {{commonly}} classified by their ejecta. <b>Craters</b> with one ejecta layer are called single-layer ejecta (SLE) <b>craters.</b> <b>Craters</b> with two superposed ejecta blankets are called double-layer ejecta (DLE) <b>craters,</b> and <b>craters</b> {{with more than}} two ejecta layers are called multiple-layered ejecta (MLE) <b>craters.</b> These morphological differences are thought to reflect compositional differences (i.e. interlayered ice, rock, or water) in the subsurface {{at the time of}} impact.|$|R
2500|$|Because of {{the many}} {{missions}} studying Mars since the 1960s, we have good coverage of its surface which contains large numbers of <b>craters.</b> [...] Many of the <b>craters</b> on Mars are different than on our moon and other moons since Mars contains ice under the ground, especially in the higher latitudes. [...] Some {{of the types of}} <b>craters</b> that have special shapes due to impact into ice-rich ground are pedestal <b>craters,</b> rampart <b>craters,</b> expanded <b>craters,</b> and LARLE <b>craters.</b>|$|R
5|$|Since 2004, new glaciers {{have formed}} on the <b>crater</b> wall above <b>Crater</b> Glacier feeding rock and ice to <b>Crater</b> Glacier below. In addition, {{there are two}} rock glaciers {{to the north of}} the eastern lobe of <b>Crater</b> Glacier and one north of the western lobe. Two of these rock glaciers have merged with the <b>Crater</b> Glacier, with one on the west and one on the east. The other rock glacier on the eastern slopes of the <b>crater</b> wall is very close to {{touching}} the glacier.|$|E
5|$|Grissom <b>crater</b> is one {{of several}} located {{on the far side of}} the Moon named for Apollo astronauts, near a large <b>crater</b> (walled plain) named Apollo.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Gerty Cori {{died after}} a ten-year {{struggle}} with myelosclerosis. She remained {{active in the}} research laboratory until the end. She received recognition for her achievements through multiple awards and honors. The Cori <b>crater</b> on the Moon and the Cori <b>crater</b> on Venus are named after her.|$|E
50|$|Because of the Moon's lack of water, and atmosphere, or tectonic plates, {{there is}} little erosion, and <b>craters</b> are found that exceed two billion years in age. The age of large <b>craters</b> is {{determined}} by the number of smaller <b>craters</b> contained within it, older <b>craters</b> generally accumulating more small, contained <b>craters.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} {{of fresh}} <b>craters</b> {{on the moon}} shows a regular dependence on the <b>crater's</b> size (Howard, 1974). Small fresh <b>craters</b> tend to be bowl shaped, while slump terraces and central peaks appear simultaneously in the 10 - 30 km size range. Flat hummocky floors characterize somewhat larger <b>craters</b> (30 - 100 km). <b>Craters</b> larger than 200 km diameter acquire multiple mountain rings. The transition between bowl shaped <b>craters</b> and <b>craters</b> with slumped rims and central peaks is marked by an abrupt kink in the depthldiameter curve, slumped <b>craters</b> tending to be shallower (Pike, 1974). The depthldiameter ratio of fresh lunar <b>craters</b> is close to. 2 for all <b>craters</b> up to about 15 km rim to rim diameter. The depth of all <b>craters</b> larger than 15 km diameter lies between 3 and 5 km and is nearly independent of diameter. A small population of unslumped <b>craters</b> with diameters between 15 and 30 km lies on {{the continuation of the}} depthldiameter =. 2 line. The dependence of the morphology of fresh lunar <b>craters</b> on diameter has long been attributed to gravity induced mass movements (Quaide et al., 1965) ...|$|R
50|$|Mercurian <b>craters</b> {{have the}} {{morphological}} elements of lunar <b>craters</b> - the smaller <b>craters</b> are bowl-shaped,and with increasing size, they develop scalloped rims, central peaks, and terraces {{on the inner}} walls. The ejectasheets have a hilly, lineated texture and swarms of secondary impact <b>craters.</b> Fresh <b>craters</b> of all sizes have dark orbright halos and well-developed ray systems. Although mercurian and lunar <b>craters</b> are superficially similar, theyshow subtle differences, especially in deposit extent. The continuous ejecta and fields of secondary <b>craters</b> onMercury are far less extensive (by a factor of about 0.65) for a given rim diameter than those of comparable lunarcraters. This difference results from the 2.5 times higher gravitational field on Mercury compared with the Moon. As on the Moon, impact <b>craters</b> on Mercury are progressively degraded by subsequent impacts. Thefreshest <b>craters</b> have ray systems and a crisp morphology. With further degradation, the <b>craters</b> lose their crisp morphology and rays and features on the continuous ejecta become more blurred until only the raised rim near thecrater remains recognizable. Because <b>craters</b> become progressively degraded with time, the degree of degradationgives a rough indication of the <b>crater's</b> relative age. On the assumption that <b>craters</b> of similar size andmorphology are roughly the same age, {{it is possible to}} place constraints on the ages of other underlying or overlyingunits and thus to globally map the relative age of <b>craters.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 2016, a {{scientific}} drilling project drilled {{deep into the}} peak ring of the impact <b>crater,</b> hundreds of meters below the current sea floor, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself. The discoveries were widely seen as confirming current theories related to both the <b>crater</b> impact and its effects.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{several other}} craters of {{around the same}} age as Chicxulub have been discovered, all between latitudes 20°N and 70°N. Examples include the disputed Silverpit <b>crater</b> in the North Sea and the Boltysh <b>crater</b> in Ukraine. Both are much smaller than Chicxulub, but are likely to have been caused by objects many tens of meters across {{striking}} the Earth. This has led to the hypothesis that the Chicxulub impact may have been only one of several impacts that happened nearly at the same time. Another possible <b>crater</b> thought to have been formed at the same time is the larger Shiva <b>crater,</b> though the structure's status as an impact <b>crater</b> is contested.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{have so far}} {{recognized}} {{only one}} class of geological feature on Umbriel—craters. The surface of Umbriel has far more and larger craters than do Ariel and Titania. It shows the least geological activity. In fact, among the Uranian moons only Oberon has more impact craters than Umbriel. The observed <b>crater</b> diameters range from a few kilometers {{at the low end}} to 210kilometers for the largest known <b>crater,</b> Wokolo. All recognized craters on Umbriel have central peaks, but no <b>crater</b> has rays.|$|E
50|$|Lunar <b>craters</b> are impact <b>craters</b> on Earth's Moon. The Moon's surface {{has many}} <b>craters,</b> {{almost all of}} which were formed by impacts.|$|R
50|$|Ghost <b>craters</b> are impact <b>craters</b> {{that have}} been filled with {{volcanic}} deposits. Ghost <b>craters</b> can be observed {{on the surface of}} the Moon, Mars, Mercury, and may possibly exist on Venus. On Mercury, ghost <b>craters</b> are most commonly found in the northern hemisphere of the planet in the smooth plains. There are three types of ghost <b>craters</b> on Mercury. Type one ghost <b>craters</b> contains a wrinkle ridge that forms a ring while type two ghost <b>craters</b> contain a wrinkle ridge ring and graben in the interior. Type three ghost <b>crater's</b> wrinkle ridge ring either does not exist or can not be observed. Instead, it has a ring of graben along its border.|$|R
3000|$|<b>Craters</b> Diameters {{of typical}} <b>craters</b> could reach {{as high as}} several millimeters. Serious arc {{discharge}} accompanying the high-speed friction would be major contributions {{to the formation of}} <b>craters.</b>|$|R
5|$|Surrounding Aristarchus {{are several}} smaller craters, {{many of which}} are {{probably}} secondary craters. Secondary craters form when large blocks ejected from the primary <b>crater</b> reimpact the surface at high velocities. By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing a letter {{on the side of the}} <b>crater</b> midpoint that is closest to the primary <b>crater.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Apollo 14 {{crew members}} sampled {{boulders}} in the ejecta of Cone <b>crater.</b> These boulders {{appeared to be}} layered and fractured breccias, contrasting from {{the appearance of the}} surrounding area because of their older age. As these boulders increase in size and number closer to Cone <b>crater,</b> it is believed that they originate from the greatest depth of excavation of Cone <b>crater.</b> These boulders show what is believed to be general characteristics of the Fra Mauro formation: clastic texture, stratification, and jointing or fracturing.|$|E
5|$|The Klamath {{tribe of}} Native Americans, whose {{ancestors}} may {{have witnessed the}} collapse of Mount Mazama {{and the formation of}} <b>Crater</b> Lake, have long regarded the lake as a sacred site. Their legends tell of a battle between the sky god Skell and the god of the underworld Llao. Mount Mazama was destroyed in the battle, creating <b>Crater</b> Lake, called giiwas in the Klamath language. The Klamath people used <b>Crater</b> Lake in vision quests, which often involved climbing the caldera walls and other dangerous tasks. Those who were successful in such quests were often regarded as having more spiritual powers. The tribe still holds <b>Crater</b> Lake in high regard as a spiritual site.|$|E
5000|$|A {{detailed}} discussion of various kinds of Martian <b>craters,</b> including double-layer ejecta <b>craters</b> (rampart <b>craters)</b> {{can be found in}} a 2014 paper by David Weiss and James Head ...|$|R
40|$|Multivariate {{analyses}} were performed on certain linear dimensions of six genetic types of <b>craters.</b> A total of 320 <b>craters,</b> consisting of laboratory fluidization <b>craters,</b> <b>craters</b> formed by chemical and nuclear explosives, terrestrial maars and other volcanic <b>craters,</b> and terrestrial meteorite impact <b>craters,</b> authenticated and probable, were analyzed in the first data set {{in terms of their}} mean rim crest diameter, mean interior relief, rim height, and mean exterior rim width. The second data set contained an additional 91 terrestrial <b>craters</b> of which 19 were of experimental percussive impact and 28 of volcanic collapse origin, and which was analyzed in terms of mean rim crest diameter, mean interior relief, and rim height. Principal component {{analyses were}} performed on the six genetic types of <b>craters.</b> Ninety per cent of the variation in the variables can be accounted for by two components. Ninety-nine per cent of the variation in the <b>craters</b> formed by chemical and nuclear explosives is explained by the first component alone...|$|R
50|$|Impact <b>craters</b> {{generally}} have a rim with ejecta around them, in contrast volcanic <b>craters</b> {{usually do not}} have a rim or ejecta deposits. Sometimes <b>craters</b> expose layers that were buried. Rocks from deep underground are tossed onto the surface. Hence, <b>craters</b> can show us what lies deep under the surface.|$|R
5|$|The Tycho impact, which {{occurred}} between 15–20 and 70–95 million years ago, formed secondary <b>crater</b> clusters in various {{locations of the}} Moon. Data from the examination of these clusters suggest that the central <b>crater</b> cluster in the valley formed {{as a result of}} said impact. Upon analysis of known secondary impact clusters resulting from the Tycho impact, it has been discovered that the majority of them have a downrange ejecta blanket, or debris layer, with a distinctive 'birdsfoot' pattern. Apollo 17 observation data and comparison between the valley's central <b>crater</b> cluster and known Tycho secondary impacts shows many similarities between the two. The central <b>crater</b> cluster has a birdsfoot ejecta pattern that points in the direction of Tycho and the debris pattern of the light mantle points directly towards the South massif. The latter piece of evidence further supports the hypothesis that the light mantle formed {{as a result of an}} avalanche occurring on the aforementioned massif because of secondary Tycho impacts. Large-scale analysis suggests that the <b>crater</b> cluster may be part of a larger secondary cluster of Tycho, including craters on the North massif and other clusters as far north as Littrow <b>crater.</b> If indeed related, the smaller clusters form a large cluster that could be part of a nearby ray of Tycho.|$|E
5|$|The <b>crater</b> was {{discovered}} by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who {{had been looking for}} petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a <b>crater</b> and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the impact origin of the <b>crater</b> includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas.|$|E
5|$|This <b>crater</b> {{has also}} been {{proposed}} as a future site for a large infrared telescope. The low temperature of the <b>crater</b> floor makes it ideal for infrared observations, and solar cells placed along the rim could provide near-continuous power to the observatory. About 120 kilometers from the <b>crater</b> lies the 5-km tall Malapert Mountain, a peak that is perpetually visible from the Earth, and which {{could serve as a}} radio relay station when suitably equipped.|$|E
40|$|Information on the {{petrology}} {{and ages}} of the SNC meteorites, together with geological data derived from Viking Orbiter images, are used to identify 25 candidate impact <b>craters</b> in the Tharsis region of Mars that could possibly be the source <b>craters</b> for these meteorites. The <b>craters</b> chosen as candidate source <b>craters</b> had diameters greater than 10 km, morphologies indicative of young <b>craters,</b> and satisfied both the petrological criteria of the SNCs and the proposed 1. 3 Ga crystallization ages. On {{the basis of the}} constraints implied by the identification of the candidate source <b>craters,</b> interpretations of the absolute chronology of Mars are proposed...|$|R
50|$|Small <b>craters</b> {{of special}} {{interest}} (for example, visited by lunar missions) receive human first names (Robert, José, Louise etc.). One of the biggest lunar <b>craters,</b> Apollo, is named after Apollo missions. Many smaller <b>craters</b> inside and near it bear the names of deceased American astronauts, and many <b>craters</b> inside and near Mare Moscoviense bear the names of deceased Soviet cosmonauts. Besides this, in 1970 twelve <b>craters</b> were named after twelve living astronauts (6 Soviet and 6 American).|$|R
40|$|The Bouguer {{gravity of}} mass {{anomalies}} associated with four Imbrian age <b>craters,</b> analyzed {{in the present}} paper, are found to differ considerably from {{the values of the}} mass anomalies associated with some young lunar <b>craters.</b> Of the Imbrian age <b>craters,</b> only Piccolomini exhibits a negative gravity anomaly (i. e., a low density region) which is characteristic of the young <b>craters</b> studied. The Bouguer gravity anomalies are zero for each of the remaining Imbrian age <b>craters.</b> Since, Piccolomini is younger, or at least less modified, than the other Imbrian age <b>craters,</b> it is suggested that the processes responsible for the post-impact modification of the Imbrian age <b>craters</b> may also be responsible for removing the negative mass anomalies initially associated with these features...|$|R
5|$|With {{the recent}} {{volcanic}} activity starting in 2004, the glacier lobes were pushed aside and upward by {{the growth of}} new volcanic domes. The surface of the glacier, once mostly without crevasses, turned into a chaotic jumble of icefalls heavily criss-crossed with crevasses and seracs caused by movement of the <b>crater</b> floor. The new domes have almost separated the <b>Crater</b> Glacier into an eastern and western lobe. Despite the volcanic activity, the termini of the glacier have still advanced, with a slight advance on the western lobe and a more considerable advance on the more shaded eastern lobe. Due to the advance, two lobes of the glacier joined together in late May 2008 and thus the glacier completely surrounds the lava domes. In addition, since 2004, new glaciers have formed on the <b>crater</b> wall above <b>Crater</b> Glacier feeding rock and ice onto its surface below; there are two rock glaciers {{to the north of}} the eastern lobe of <b>Crater</b> Glacier. <b>Crater</b> Glacier is the only known advancing glacier in the contiguous United States.|$|E
5|$|Zethus <b>Crater</b> is {{the largest}} (diameter about 40km) <b>crater</b> on and the only named surface feature of Jupiter's moon Thebe. There are several bright spots at the rim of this <b>crater.</b> It {{is located on the}} far side of Thebe, facing away from Jupiter. It was {{discovered}} by the Galileo spacecraft. It is named for Zethus, the husband of the nymph Thebe in Greek mythology.|$|E
5|$|As Apollo 17 was {{the final}} lunar mission of the Apollo program, several {{different}} scientific objectives were identified {{in order to maximize}} the scientific productivity of the mission. Landing sites considered for previous missions, but were rejected were reconsidered. Taurus–Littrow was one of several potential landing sites considered for Apollo 17 along with Tycho <b>crater,</b> Copernicus <b>crater,</b> Tsiolkovskiy <b>crater</b> on the far side, among others. All but Taurus–Littrow were eventually eliminated for scientific and/or operational reasons. A landing at Tycho was thought to be too dangerous because of the rough terrain found there, a landing on the far side in Tsiolkovskiy would add the expense of communications satellites necessary to maintain contact between the crew and ground control during surface operations, and a landing in Copernicus was regarded as low priority.|$|E
30|$|The {{ruptured}} <b>craters</b> are along all {{the ridge}} {{systems in the}} study area (Fig.  7). Some are as small as ∼ 100  m in diameter, suggesting that the tectonic activities along ridges are geologically very young. On the basis of the degradation levels classified by Moore et al. (1980), the <b>craters</b> as small 100  m in diameter with shallow bowl-shaped morphology are classified as Copernican <b>craters.</b> The <b>craters</b> that are 80 – 100  m in diameter with gentle depression morphology are classified into the latest stage of Eratosthenian. In our analysis, the observed <b>craters</b> smaller than 100 m were categorized into shallow bowl-shaped <b>craters,</b> which suggest their formation ages are Copernican Period. Accordingly, all the ridge systems were at least partly active still in the Copernican Period. Note that the observed <b>craters</b> may contain secondary <b>craters.</b> Since it is a qualitative analysis, some of them might be formed in the Eratosthenian Period.|$|R
40|$|The depth/diameter {{ratio for}} 87 <b>craters</b> on Mars is {{determined}} using Mariner 9 ultraviolet-spectrometer (UVS) altimetry. The sample includes <b>craters</b> 12 to 100 km {{in diameter and}} 0. 4 to 3. 3 km in depth. The largest depth/diameter ratios on Mars are {{comparable to those of}} fresh <b>craters</b> on Mercury. However, {{more than half of the}} present sample consists of degraded <b>craters</b> whose depths are significantly shallower than those of fresh <b>craters</b> of similar diameter on Mercury, confirming the interpretations of earlier photoanalysts...|$|R
