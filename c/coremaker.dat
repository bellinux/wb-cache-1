50|$|While {{still in}} school, Meyner had been {{employed}} {{as an apprentice}} <b>coremaker</b> by the Warren Foundry and Pipe Corporation and Ingersoll Rand. During his college years, Meyner was employed as a weaver by the Gunning Silk Company. Following his graduation from Columbia, Meyner found employment as a law clerk in Union City. He was employed by J. Emil Walscheid and Milton Rosenkranz from February, 1933 to April, 1936.|$|E

50|$|The {{union was}} founded in 1920 with the merger of the Associated Iron Moulders of Scotland, the Amalgamated Society of <b>Coremakers</b> of Great Britain and Ireland and the Friendly Society of Iron Founders of England, Ireland and Wales. The Scottish Brassmoulders' Union joined in 1942, and the Associated Iron, Steel and Brass Dressers of Scotland merged in during 1945. In 1946, the union merged with the Ironfounding Workers' Association and the United Metal Founders' Society to form the Amalgamated Union of Foundry Workers.|$|R
5000|$|In 1905, {{the union}} {{relocated}} back to Manchester, to a purpose-built headquarters on Chorlton Road. [...] The union's entire executive was dismissed in 1912 for agreeing to pay itself expenses at 12s 6d per day, when the rules stated {{it was only}} due 7s. This led to a lengthy dispute during which former assistant general secretary Jeremiah Olive ran the union until fresh elections were held in 1914 and won by a new face, Alfred Todd. [...] Todd took the union into a merger in 1920, joining with the Amalgamated Society of <b>Coremakers</b> of Great Britain and Ireland and the Associated Iron Moulders of Scotland to form the National Union of Foundry Workers.|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} data from three {{analyses}} of occupational mortality for England and Wales {{to investigate a}} suspected hazard of pneumonia in welders. Mortality from the disease was consistently raised in welders aged 15 - 64, with standardised mortality ratios of 184 (95 % Cl 150 - 224) in 1959 - 63 and 157 (121 - 200) in 1970 - 72. Analysis of data for 1979 - 80 and 1982 - 90 showed that the increased risk is attributable mainly to an excess of pneumococcal and unspecified lobar pneumonia (proportional mortality ratio 255, 95 % Cl 192 - 332). No excess occurred in men above retirement age (65). A possible explanation of these findings is that welding fume reversibly increases the susceptibility of the lung to pneumonic infection. The observation of a similar mortality pattern in moulders and <b>coremakers</b> points to the metallic component of the fume as a possible culprit, but ozone or oxides of nitrogen could also be implicated. There are grounds for lobar pneumonia to be considered an occupational disease in welder...|$|R
