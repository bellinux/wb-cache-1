5|$|In September 1330, Charles {{launched}} a military expedition against Basarab of Wallachia who {{had attempted to}} get rid of his suzerainty. After seizing the fortress of Severin (present-day Drobeta-Turnu Severin in Romania), he refused to make peace with Basarab and marched towards Curtea de Argeș, which was Basarab's seat. The Wallachians applied scorched earth tactics, compelling Charles to make a truce with Basarab and withdraw his troops from Wallachia. While the royal troops were marching through a narrow pass across the Southern Carpathians on 9November, the Wallachians ambushed them. During the next four days, the royal army was decimated; Charles could only escape from the battlefield after changing his <b>clothes</b> <b>with</b> one of his knights, Desiderius Héder, who sacrificed his life to enable the king's escape. Charles did not attempt a new invasion of Wallachia, which subsequently developed into an independent principality.|$|E

5|$|Seetharamudu was a {{barrister}} {{who returned}} from London upon his father's death to manage his family businesses. He was a zamindar and {{was fond of}} cars. In one such instance, he sees a poor farmer called Ramalakshmi and decides to marry her. Asked by a mediator, she accepts the proposal, without meeting Seetharamudu, but asks him for six months' delay as she has to buy new clothes for the bridegroom, following the village's tradition. Seetharamudu learns about this and meets her as a reformed thief. With his help, Ramalakshmi could cultivate enough grain in three months and buy new <b>clothes</b> <b>with</b> that money. On the day of marriage, she is surprised to know that Seetharamudu is her chosen groom and they marry. On 14 February 1924 the couple goes out, but Chaitanya, suffering from fever then, fakes a stomach ache so that his parents return. The plan works and the couple rush home at high speed but die in an accident at 10:20 AM near the same clock tower where Radha Mohan and Krishna Veni would die. Now he aims to reunite them without letting them recollect their past as they cannot bear the pain of losing him.|$|E
5|$|Ten months later, {{she became}} editor of US Vogue. Under Mirabella, {{it had become}} more focused on lifestyles {{as a whole and}} less on fashion. Industry {{insiders}} worried that it was losing ground to the recently introduced American edition of Elle. After making sweeping changes in staff, she changed the style of the cover pictures. Mirabella had preferred tight head shots of well-known models in studios; Wintour's covers showed more of the body and were taken outside, like those Diana Vreeland had done years earlier. She used less well-known models, and mixed inexpensive <b>clothes</b> <b>with</b> high fashion: the first issue she was in charge of, November 1988, featured a Peter Lindbergh photograph of 19-year-old Michaela Bercu in a $50 pair of faded jeans and a bejeweled jacket by Christian Lacroix worth $10,000. It was the first time a Vogue cover model had worn jeans (Bercu was originally supposed to have worn the skirt that coordinated with the jacket, but she had gained some weight and it didn't fit).|$|E
5|$|The cross Vladimir held {{when he was}} {{beheaded}} is also {{regarded as}} a relic. Traditionally {{under the care of}} the Andrović family from the village of Velji Mikulići in southeastern Montenegro, the cross is only shown to believers on the Feast of Pentecost, when it is carried in a procession to the summit of Mount Rumija. Jovan Vladimir is regarded as the first Serbian saint and the patron saint of the town of Bar in Montenegro. His earliest, lost hagiography was probably written sometime between 1075 and 1089; a shortened version, written in Latin, is preserved in the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja. His hagiographies in Greek and Church Slavonic were first published, respectively, in 1690 and 1802. The saint is classically depicted in icons as a monarch wearing a crown and regal <b>clothes,</b> <b>with</b> a cross in his right hand and his own head in his left hand. He is fabled to have carried his severed head to his place of burial.|$|E

25|$|Women {{giving birth}} at Hotel-Dieu and other {{hospitals}} were almost always poor and often wanted {{to hide their}} pregnancy; they were literally confined, unable to leave, and {{were not allowed to}} have visitors. They wore bed <b>clothes</b> <b>with</b> blue markings so they could be spotted if they tried to leave without authorization. They slept in large beds for four persons each. In 1795, the first maternity hospital in Paris was opened at Port-Royal, which eventually also included a school for training midwives.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} annual celebration is {{the feast of}} the patroness of the community, Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception. At least a thousand migrants return each year to Landa to celebrate, with many of these come from Texas especially Corpus Christi, Houston, Austin and Dallas, bringing their pickup trucks and cowboy <b>clothes</b> <b>with</b> them, but a number also come from Florida and Atlanta. The town hosts a major dance for the occasion, in part to honor the returnees. The event is held {{during the first half of}} December. The event often features musical styles popular in Texas.|$|E
25|$|His {{nickname}} has a {{basis in}} this legend. “Chucho” {{is a common}} nickname for his given name “Jesús.” “El Roto” refers to his ability and tendency to dress in fine <b>clothes,</b> <b>with</b> “roto” referring to a well-dressed person, especially someone from the lower classes in fine clothing. In later literary works about him, this would be interpreted in various ways, either as his insulting the lower classes from which he came or as symbolize of his basic honor. Others acknowledge {{that he may have}} done so to avoid mistreatment prevalent against the poor of the time.|$|E
25|$|It {{takes its}} name {{either from the}} {{lightness}} of the material {{of which it is}} made, or from the fact that during the Nicene Creed in the Divine Liturgy, the priest holds it high in the air and waves it slowly over the Chalice and Diskos. Its original use was to cover the Chalice and prevent anything from falling into it before the consecration. It symbolizes the swaddling <b>clothes</b> <b>with</b> which Christ was wrapped at his Nativity, and also the grave clothes in which he was wrapped at his burial (both themes are found in the text of the Liturgy of Preparation).|$|E

25|$|Schiaparelli {{is one of}} the {{designers}} credited with offering the first <b>clothes</b> <b>with</b> visible zippers in 1930. Rather than being concealed, zippers became a key element of Schiaparelli's designs, visibly fastening necklines and running down sleeves and skirts. She used chunky plastic zippers made from cellulose nitrate, the first semi-synthetic plastic fabric, and cellulose acetate. Along with Charles James, Schiaparelli had arrangements with the manufacturers to promote their zip fasteners, using specific brands depending on where the garment would be sold (such as Éclair for Paris models, Lightning Fastener Co. for London models, and Hookless Fastener Co. zips for American export models).|$|E

Eventually he came to his enemies, the Teutonic Knights, asking for protection and military aid against Jogaila. According to Wigand of Marburg, Birutė, mother of Vytautas, was drowned in Brest, likely in response to his escape. Two of her relatives, Vidimantas and Butrimas, were also murdered.|$|E
