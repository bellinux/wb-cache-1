This system allows for up to 4 <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> in the market. The EZ-Link card was introduced on 13 April 2002 {{as a replacement for}} the original TransitLink farecard, while its competitor the NETS FlashPay card entered the smartcard market on 9 October 2009.|$|E

50|$|The CSC {{for each}} card (form 1 and 2) is {{generated}} by the <b>card</b> <b>issuer</b> when the <b>card</b> is issued. It is calculated by encrypting the bank card number and expiration date (two fields printed on the card) with encryption keys known only to the <b>card</b> <b>issuer,</b> and decimalising the result.|$|R
25|$|A {{secured credit}} card {{is a type}} of credit card secured by a deposit account owned by the {{cardholder}}. Typically, the cardholder must deposit between 100% and 200% of the total amount of credit desired. Thus if the cardholder puts down $1,000, they will be given credit in the range of $500–1,000. In some cases, credit <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> will offer incentives even on their secured card portfolios. In these cases, the deposit required may be significantly less than the required credit limit, and can be as low as 10% of the desired credit limit. This deposit is held in a special savings account. Credit <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> offer this because they have noticed that delinquencies were notably reduced when the customer perceives something to lose if the balance is not repaid.|$|E
25|$|Many {{credit cards}} {{can also be}} used in an ATM to {{withdraw}} money against the credit limit extended to the card, but many <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> charge interest on cash advances before they do so on purchases. The interest on cash advances is commonly charged from the date the withdrawal is made, rather than the monthly billing date. Many <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> levy a commission for cash withdrawals, even if the ATM belongs to the same bank as the card issuer. Merchants do not offer cashback on credit card transactions because they would pay a percentage commission of the additional cash amount to their bank or merchant services provider, thereby making it uneconomical. Discover is a notable exception to the above. A customer with a Discover card may get up to $120 cash back if the merchant allows it. This amount is simply added to the card holder's cost of the transaction and no extra fees are charged as the transaction is not considered a cash advance.|$|E
25|$|Plaintiffs {{allege that}} Visa, MasterCard, and major credit <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> {{engaged in a}} {{conspiracy}} to fix interchange fees, also known as swipe fees, that are charged to merchants {{for the privilege of}} accepting payment cards at artificially high levels. In their complaint, the plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unfairly interfere with merchants from encouraging customers to use less expensive forms of payment such as lower-cost cards, cash, and checks.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{some have}} called for Congress to enact {{additional}} regulations on the industry to expand the disclosure box clearly disclosing rate hikes, use plain language, incorporate balance payoff disclosures, and also to outlaw universal default. At a congress hearing around 1 March 2007, Citibank announced {{it would no longer}} practice this, effective immediately. Opponents of such regulation argue that customers must become more proactive and self-responsible in evaluating and negotiating terms with credit providers. Some of the nation's influential top credit <b>card</b> <b>issuers,</b> which are among the top fifty corporate contributors to political campaigns, successfully opposed it.|$|E
25|$|On 26 August 2008, Land Transport Authority {{announced}} a two-month {{trial of the}} new generation Contactless ePurse Application (CEPAS) card that was developed in-house. It is intended to standardise the technology of cashless payment, allowing for use on public transport, Electronic Road Pricing (ERP), everyday shopping and meals. The card has replaced this generation of EZ-Link cards in 2009 and aims to encourage competition by allowing up to four CEPAS <b>card</b> <b>issuers.</b> Mass replacement of the old Sony FeliCa cards to the new CEPAS cards went on at TransitLink Ticket offices and Singapore Post outlets till 7 October 2009.|$|E
25|$|The Credit CARD Act of 2009 {{requires}} that consumers opt into over-limit charges. Some <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> have therefore commenced solicitations requesting customers to opt into overlimit fees, presenting {{this as a}} benefit as it may avoid {{the possibility of a}} future transaction being declined. Other issuers have simply discontinued the practice of charging overlimit fees. Whether a customer opts into the overlimit fee or not, banks will in practice have discretion as to whether they choose to authorize transactions above the credit limit or not. Of course, any approved over limit transactions will only result in an overlimit fee for those customers who have opted into the fee. This legislation took effect on 22 February 2010. Following this Act, the companies are now required by law to show on a customer's bills {{how long it would take}} them to pay off the balance.|$|E

In 2004, in the UK, the cost of fraud was over £500 million. When a card is stolen, or an unauthorized duplicate made, most <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> will refund {{some or all of}} the charges that the customer has received for things they did not buy. These refunds will, in some cases, be at the expense of the merchant, especially in mail order cases where the merchant cannot claim sight of the card. In several countries, merchants will lose the money if no ID card was asked for, therefore merchants usually require ID card in these countries. Credit card companies generally guarantee the merchant will be paid on legitimate transactions regardless of whether the consumer pays their credit card bill.|$|E
25|$|Wilmington {{has become}} a {{national}} financial center for the credit card industry, largely due to regulations enacted by former Governor Pierre S. du Pont, IV in 1981. The Financial Center Development Act of 1981, among other things, eliminated the usury laws enacted by most states, thereby removing the cap on interest rates that banks may legally charge customers. Many major credit <b>card</b> <b>issuers,</b> including Bank of America (formerly MBNA Corporation), Chase Card Services (part of JPMorgan Chase & Co., formerly Bank One/First USA), and Barclays Bank of Delaware (formerly Juniper Bank), are headquartered in Wilmington. The Dutch banking giant ING Groep N.V. headquartered its U.S. internet banking unit, ING Direct (now Capital One 360), in Wilmington. The United Kingdom's HSBC has their American operations headquartered in Wilmington. Wilmington Trust is headquartered in Wilmington at Rodney Square. Barclays and Capital One 360 have very large and prominent locations located along the waterfront of the Christina River. In 1988, the Delaware legislature enacted a law which required a would-be acquirer to capture 85 percent of a Delaware chartered corporation's stock in a single transaction or wait three years before proceeding. This law strengthened Delaware's position as {{a safe haven for}} corporate charters during an especially turbulent time filled with hostile takeovers.|$|E

When a purchase is made, the cardholder agrees to pay the <b>card</b> <b>issuer.</b> The cardholder indicates consent to pay by signing a receipt with a record of the card details and indicating the amount to be paid or by entering a personal identification number (PIN). Also, many merchants now accept verbal authorizations via telephone and electronic authorization using the Internet, known as a card not present transaction (CNP).|$|R
500|$|Under Sears ownership, in 1986, {{the firm}} {{launched}} the Discover Card, a new brand {{of credit card}} outside the well established Visa, MasterCard and American Express networks. [...] Unlike other attempts at creating a credit card to rival MasterCard and VISA, such as Citibank's Choice card, the Discover Card quickly gained a large national consumer base. It carried no annual fee, which was uncommon at the time, and offered a typically higher credit limit than similar cards. [...] Cardholders could earn a [...] "Cashback Bonus," [...] in which {{a percentage of the}} amount spent would be refunded to the account (originally 2%, now as high as 5%), depending on how much the card was used.

2500|$|There are {{different}} methods of calculating credit scores. FICO score, {{the most widely}} known type of credit score, is a credit score developed by FICO, previously known as Fair Isaac Corporation. [...] It is used by many mortgage lenders that use a risk-based system to determine {{the possibility that the}} borrower may default on financial obligations to the mortgage lender. All credit scores must be subject to availability. The credit bureaus all have their own credit scores: Equifax's ScorePower ( [...] FICO score from Equifax [...] ), Equifax Credit Score, Experian's PLUS score, and TransUnion's credit score, and each also sells the VantageScore credit score. In addition, many large lenders, including the major credit <b>card</b> <b>issuers,</b> have developed their own proprietary scoring models.|$|E
2500|$|Interest charges {{vary widely}} from card issuer to card issuer. Often, there are [...] "teaser" [...] rates {{in effect for}} initial periods of time (as low as zero percent for, say, six months), whereas regular rates can {{be as high as}} 40 percent. In the U.S. there is no federal limit on the {{interest}} or late fees credit <b>card</b> <b>issuers</b> can charge; the interest rates are set by the states, with some states such as South Dakota, having no ceiling on interest rates and fees, inviting some banks to establish their credit card operations there. Other states, for example Delaware, have very weak usury laws. The teaser rate no longer applies if the customer does not pay their bills on time, and is replaced by a penalty interest rate (for example, 23.99%) that applies retroactively.|$|E

A majority of named class plaintiffs have objected and vowed {{to opt out of}} the settlement. Opponents object to provisions that would bar future lawsuits and even prevent merchants from opting out of significant portions of the proposed settlement. Stephen Neuwirth, a lawyer representing Home Depot, said, [...] "It’s so obvious Visa and MasterCard were prepared to make a large payment because of the scope of the releases being given.
