In the fairy tale The Adventures of Pinocchio, the title character is a gullible puppet who is repeatedly duped by other characters; part of his transformation into a human being is learning to avoid gullibility while still exercising empathy. In {{the first part of}} [...] "Little Red Riding Hood", the title character is deceived by a wolf; from this experience she learns to feign gullibility in order to deceive a second wolf. In [...] "The Emperors New Clothes", the emperor and his staff display gullibility in being swindled, while the crowd displays credulity in believing in the invisible <b>cloth.</b> <b>Mark</b> Twain depicts mass gullibility in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today, among others. Shakespeare explores gullibility in the title characters of Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, and especially Othello. Of the examples of deception found in the Bible, the tale that most concerns the behavior of the deceived is Samson in the Book of Judges, a character who is destroyed by his gullibility in the face of love. The best-known example is Eves gullibility in the Book of Genesis.|$|E

With Jonathan Bishop and Ellie Harrison. The Peckham Experiment was a groundbreaking health centre focussing on wellness rather than the later NHS disease model. It existed from 1926 - 1950, founded by George Scott Williamson and Innes Hope Pierce. Central to their philosophy was a belief that if left to themselves people would spontaneously begin to organise in a creative way. Research findings included 'when people are given resources in a community to enable them to grow they will be active in their community for the benefit of that community'. The Peckham Experiment was based in The Pioneer Health Centre, a custom built modernist building which has since been sold as luxury apartments. It was organised as a club that families joined, with dances, swimming pool, library and farm grown food...|$|E

50|$|The archeologists E. M. Murphy and J. P. Mallory of the Queen's University of Belfast, {{have argued}} (Antiquity, 74 (2000):388-94) that Herodotus was mistaken in his {{interpretation}} of what he imagined to be cannibalism. Recently excavated sites in southern Siberia, such as the large cemetery at Aymyrlyg in Tuva containing more than 1,000 burials of the Scythian period, have revealed accumulations of bones often arranged in anatomical order. This indicates burials of semi-decomposed corpses or defleshed skeletons, sometimes associated with leather bags or <b>cloth</b> sacks. <b>Marks</b> on some bones show cut-marks of a nature indicative of defleshing, but most appear to suggest disarticulation of adult skeletons. Murphy and Mallory suggest that, since the Issedones were nomads living with cattle herds, they moved up the mountains in summer, but they wanted their dead to be buried at their winter camp; defleshing and dismemberment {{of the people who}} died in summer would have been more hygienic than allowing the corpses to decompose naturally in the summer heat. Burial of the dismembered remains would have taken place in fall after returning to winter camp, but before the ground was frozen completely. Such procedures of defleshing and dismemberment may have been mistaken for evidence of cannibalism by foreign onlookers.|$|R
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} the destruction of monuments and interruption of new construction at the site occurred simultaneously with the arrival of so-called Naranjo style ceramics, which appear to be linked to styles from the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico. The Naranjo ceramic tradition is particularly characteristic of the western Pacific coast of Guatemala between the Suchiate and Nahualate rivers. The most common forms are pitchers and bowls with a surface that has been smoothed with a <b>cloth,</b> leaving parallel <b>marks,</b> and usually coated with a white or yellow wash. At the same time, the use of local Ocosito ceramics waned. This Teotihuacan influence places the destruction of monuments {{in the second half of}} the Early Classic. The presence of the conquerors linked to the Naranjo-style ceramics was not of long duration and suggests that the conquerors exerted long-distance control of the site, replacing the local rulers with their own governors while leaving the local population intact.|$|R
60|$|I find in my {{diary of}} magical events for 1899 that I awoke at 3 A.M. {{out of a}} nightmare, and {{imagined}} one symbol to prevent its recurrence, and imagined another, a simple geometrical form, which calls up dreams of luxuriant vegetable life, that I might have pleasant dreams. I imagined it faintly, being very sleepy, and went to sleep. I had confused dreams which {{seemed to have no}} relation with the symbol. I awoke about eight, having for the time forgotten both nightmare and symbol. Presently I dozed off again and began half to dream and half to see, as one does between sleep and waking, enormous flowers and grapes. I awoke and recognized that what I had dreamed or seen was the kind of thing appropriate to the symbol before I remembered having used it. I find another record, though made some time after the event, of having imagined over the head of a person, who was a little of a seer, a combined symbol of elemental air and elemental water. This person, who did not know what symbol I was using, saw a pigeon flying with a lobster in his bill. I find that on December 13, 1898, I used a certain star-shaped symbol with a seeress, getting her to look at it intently before she began seeing. She saw a rough stone house, {{and in the middle of}} the house the skull of a horse. I find that I had used the same symbol a few days before with a seer, and that he had seen a rough stone house, and in the middle of the house something under a <b>cloth</b> <b>marked</b> with the Hammer of Thor. He had lifted the cloth and discovered a skeleton of gold with teeth of diamonds, and eyes of some unknown dim precious stones. I had made a note to this last vision, pointing out that we had been using a Solar symbol a little earlier. Solar symbols often call up visions of gold and precious stones. I do not give these examples to prove my arguments, but to illustrate them. I know that my examples will awaken in all who have not met the like, or who are not on other grounds inclined towards my arguments, a most natural incredulity. It was long before I myself would admit an inherent power in symbols, for it long seemed to me that one could account for everything by the power of one imagination over another, telepathy as it is called with that separation of knowledge and life, of word and emotion, which is the sterility of scientific speech. The symbol seemed powerful, I thought, merely because we thought it powerful, and we would do just as well without it. In those days I used symbols made with some ingenuity instead of merely imagining them. I used to give them to the person I was experimenting with, and tell him to hold them to his forehead without looking at them; and sometimes I made a mistake. I learned from these mistakes that if I did not myself imagine the symbol, in which case he would have a mixed vision, it was the symbol I gave by mistake that produced the vision. Then I met with a seer who could say to me, 'I have a vision of a square pond, but I can see your thought, and you expect me to see an oblong pond,' or, 'The symbol you are imagining has made me see a woman holding a crystal, but it was a moonlight sea I should have seen.' I discovered that the symbol hardly ever failed to call up its typical scene, its typical event, its typical person, but that I could practically never call up, no matter how vividly I imagined it, the particular scene, the particular event, the particular person I had in my own mind, and that when I could, the two visions rose side by side.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results of the first {{in-depth}} measurements of the linen cloth of the shroud of Arquata, a precious copy of the Shroud of Turin, which dates back to 1653. The measurements aimed at finding the nature of the faint and low-contrast body impressions on the linen cloth, which are not produced by drawings or paintings as in the other copies of the Shroud of Turin. In general, the optical analysis and the imaging of low-contrast stains on ancient textiles is a complex task, due to the irregular surface and the influence of spectrum, position and uniformity of the illuminating source on colour accuracy and rendition. A correct evaluation requires a multidisciplinary approach. We used noninvasive technologies, including imaging topological radar, laser induced fluorescence, absolute diffused reflectance and absorption spectra, which were previously used to study frescoes, paintings, antique papers, but were never exploited on ancient textiles. The combined results of our measurements and data elaboration allowed identifying the origins of the body impressions, of the stains simulating blood and of the other marks embedded on the linen cloth. Our results can be used to plan the proper long-term conservation of the linen <b>cloth</b> and of <b>marks</b> on it...|$|R

60|$|That night I {{stayed in}} the Harim till two A.M., wishing {{to see if it}} would be empty. But the morrow was to witness the egress to Arafat; many, therefore, passed the hours of {{darkness}} in the Harim. Numerous parties of pilgrims sat upon their rugs, with lanterns in front of them, conversing, praying, and contemplating the Ka’abah. The cloisters were full of merchants, who resorted there to “talk shop,” and to vend such holy goods as combs, tooth-sticks, and rosaries. Before ten P.M. I found no opportunity of praying the usual two prostrations over the grave of Ishmael. After waiting long and patiently, at last I was stepping into the vacant place, when another pilgrim rushed forward; the boy Mohammed, assisted by me, instantly seized him, and, despite his cries and struggles, taught him to wait. Till midnight we sat chatting with the different ciceroni who came up to offer their services. I could not help remarking their shabby and dirty clothes, and was informed that during pilgrimage, when splendour is liable to be spoiled, they wear out old dresses; and appear endimanches for the Muharram fete, when most travellers have left the city. Presently my two companions, exhausted with fatigue, fell asleep; I went up to the Ka’abah, with the intention of “annexing” a bit of the torn old Kiswat or curtain, but too many eyes were looking on. At this season of the year the Kiswat is much tattered at the base, partly by pilgrims’ fingers, and partly by the strain of the cord which confines it when the wind is blowing. It is considered a mere peccadillo to purloin a bit of the venerable stuff; but as the officers of the temple make money by selling it, they certainly would visit detection with an [p.177] unmerciful application of the quarterstaff. The piece in my possession was given to me by the boy Mohammed before I left Meccah. Waistcoats cut out of the Kiswah still make the combatants invulnerable in battle, and are considered presents fit for princes. The Moslems generally try to secure a strip of this <b>cloth</b> as a <b>mark</b> for the Koran, or for some such purpose. The opportunity, however, was favourable for a survey, and with a piece of tape, and the simple processes of stepping and spanning, I managed to measure all the objects concerning which I was curious.|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{movement}} toward repair and mending to combat the waste and over consumption that is so toxic to our planet. The environmental damage caused by textile production is the second greatest source of pollution after the oil industry. 2 In light of these immense issues that are complex and overwhelming I found myself asking; “what can I do {{to add to the}} repair of the world?” I realized that we need to mend what we can in our immediate life; to truly see what needs our attention and to assess what is broken and see beauty in the repair and the story it holds. Michael Meade, the mythologist, says it beautifully in his essay on Golden Mending, “Because the troubles of the world have grown so great and encompass both culture and nature, each person can find a crack nearby that can be turned into a golden seam. ” 3 This metaphor of stitching life back together {{is at the core of}} finding community through slow stitching in a fast paced world. The search for what can be gleaned and the combining of materials was not only instinctual but nurtured early in my life. The importance of making went back to my childhood where I would spend time with my grandmother in Shreveport, Louisiana. I played for hours laying out pretend quilts and landscapes with the scraps in the bottom drawer of her chiffonier. In this treasure trove she kept a bit of fabric from everything she made, just in case it was needed for mending. The first days of my arrival always spurred a trip to the fabric store to pick out a pattern and material. It was at this time that I learned the language of textiles; seersucker, pique and gingham in the summer; flannels, corduroy and velveteen for winter. The sense that clothing is seasonal, ceremonial and holds our memories was instilled by her and influenced all spheres of my life. When Granny travelled to see us, she always brought her mending kit (Figure 2), a small plaid case she made lined with felt that held thread, pins, needles, and a small ruler. This little case in my grandmother’s skilled hands transformed our clothing, this ability to alter and fix things became transformative for me. I too wanted those skills and spent as much time as I could by her side. In her capable hands, all the household towels, sheets and aprons were monogrammed. It was my grandmother that connected the sense of text and textiles for me. I also began embroidering and <b>marking</b> <b>cloth</b> as a way of valuing and focusing on the notion that nothing should be wasted or thrown out. Later in my life I made gallery installations of mending boxes to commemorate the sense of order and the belief in the sacredness of textiles that she passed on to me. This reverence, which I thought was Granny’s way, was deeply rooted in the worldwide traditions of reuse and stitching. This slow stitching connected us invisibly to the kantha makers in India, the Sind woman making ralli quilts, the Gees Bend quilters, and the boro traditions of Japan. Unknowingly I was initiated into these great traditions by this humble, unassuming woman...|$|R
