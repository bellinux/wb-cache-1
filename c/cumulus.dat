5|$|<b>Cumulus</b> {{supplementary}} features are most commonly {{seen with the}} species congestus. <b>Cumulus</b> virga clouds are <b>cumulus</b> clouds producing virga (precipitation that evaporates while aloft), and <b>cumulus</b> praecipitatio produce precipitation that reaches the Earth's surface. <b>Cumulus</b> pannus comprise shredded clouds that normally appear beneath the parent <b>cumulus</b> cloud during precipitation. <b>Cumulus</b> arcus clouds have a gust front, and <b>cumulus</b> tuba clouds have funnel clouds or tornadoes. <b>Cumulus</b> pileus clouds refer to <b>cumulus</b> clouds that have grown so rapidly as to force the formation of pileus {{over the top of}} the cloud. <b>Cumulus</b> velum clouds have an ice crystal veil over the growing top of the cloud.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cumulus</b> clouds come in four {{distinct}} species, cumulis humilis, mediocris, congestus, and fractus. These {{species may}} be arranged into the variety, <b>cumulus</b> radiatus; {{and may be}} accompanied by up to seven supplementary features, <b>cumulus</b> pileus, velum, virga, praecipitatio, arcus, pannus, and tuba.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cumulus</b> humilis clouds usually {{indicate}} fair weather. <b>Cumulus</b> mediocris {{clouds are}} similar, {{except that they}} have some vertical development, which implies that they can grow into <b>cumulus</b> congestus or even cumulonimbus clouds, which can produce heavy rain, lightning, severe winds, hail, and even tornadoes. <b>Cumulus</b> congestus clouds, which appear as towers, will often grow into cumulonimbus storm clouds. They can produce precipitation. Glider pilots often {{pay close attention to}} <b>cumulus</b> clouds, as they can be indicators of rising air drafts or thermals underneath that can suck the plane high into the skya phenomenon known as cloud suck.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cumulus</b> {{clouds are}} often {{precursors}} of {{other types of}} cloud, such as cumulonimbus, when influenced by weather factors such as instability, moisture, and temperature gradient. Normally, <b>cumulus</b> clouds produce little or no precipitation, but they can grow into the precipitation-bearing congestus or cumulonimbus clouds. <b>Cumulus</b> clouds can be formed from water vapor, supercooled water droplets, or ice crystals, depending upon the ambient temperature. They come in many distinct subforms, and generally cool the earth by reflecting the incoming solar radiation. <b>Cumulus</b> clouds are part of the larger category of free-convective cumuliform clouds, which include cumulonimbus clouds. The latter genus-type is sometimes categorized separately as cumulonimbiform due to its more complex structure that often includes a cirriform or anvil top. There are also cumuliform clouds of limited convection that comprise stratocumulus (low-), altocumulus (middle-étage) and cirrocumulus. (high-étage). These last three genus-types are sometimes classified separately as stratocumuliform.|$|E
5|$|In this phase, {{water vapor}} {{condenses}} on various nuclei {{present in the}} air, forming the <b>cumulus</b> cloud. This creates the characteristic flat-bottomed puffy shape associated with <b>cumulus</b> clouds. The height of the cloud (from its bottom to its top) depends on the temperature profile of the atmosphere {{and the presence of}} any inversions. During the convection, surrounding air is entrained (mixed) with the thermal and the total mass of the ascending air increases.|$|E
5|$|The symbols {{used for}} clouds emulate the cloud shape. Cirrus is {{indicated}} by a couple hooks, <b>cumulus</b> are indicated by a mound shape, with cumulonimbus indicated with an upside down trapezoid {{on top of the}} <b>cumulus</b> symbol to indicate its anvil. When {{there is more than one}} cloud type present per level, the cloud type with the highest priority is included. Knowing the cloud type at various locations can help determine whether or not a weather front has passed by a particular location. A low deck of stratus could indicate a station is still north of a warm front, while thunderstorms can indicate the approach of a squall line or cold front.|$|E

40|$|The fifth intercomparison of the Global Water and Energy Experiment Cloud System Studies Working Group 1 {{is used as}} {{a vehicle}} for better {{understanding}} the dynamics of trade wind <b>cumuli</b> capped by a strong inversion. The basis of the intercomparison is 10 simulations by 7 groups. These simulations are supplemented by many further sensitivity studies, including some with very refined grid meshes. The simulations help illustrate the turbulent dynamics of trade <b>cumuli</b> in such a regime. In many respects the dynamics are similar to those found in many previous simulations of trade <b>cumuli</b> capped by weaker inversions. The principal differences are {{the extent to which the}} cloud layer is quasi-steady in the current simulations, evidence of weak countergradient momentum transport within the cloud layer, and the development and influence of an incipient stratiform cloud layer at the top of the cloud layer. Although many elements of the turbulent structure (including the wind profiles, the evolution of cloud-base height, the statistics of the subcloud layer, and the nature of mixing in the lower and middle parts of the cloud layer) are robustly predicted, the representation of the stratiform cloud amount by the different simulations is remarkably sensitive to a number of factors.

5|$|Thermals {{begin as}} bubbles of rising air that are formed {{on the ground}} through the warming of the surface by sunlight. If the air {{contains}} enough moisture, the water will condense from the rising air and form <b>cumulus</b> clouds.|$|E
5|$|A {{stratocumulus}} cloud {{is another}} type of a cumuliform or stratocumuliform cloud. Like <b>cumulus</b> clouds, they form at low levels and via convection. However, unlike <b>cumulus</b> clouds, their growth is almost completely retarded by a strong inversion. As a result, they flatten out like stratus clouds, giving them a layered appearance. These clouds are extremely common, covering on average around twenty-three percent of the earth's oceans and twelve percent of the earth's continents. They are less common in tropical areas and commonly form after cold fronts. Additionally, stratocumulus clouds reflect {{a large amount of}} the incoming sunlight, producing a net cooling effect. Stratocumulus clouds can produce drizzle, which stabilizes the cloud by warming it and reducing turbulent mixing. Being a cloud of limited convection, stratocumulus is divided into three species; stratiformis, lenticularis, and castellanus, that are common to the higher stratocumuliform genus-types.|$|E

40|$|Bovine {{follicular}} oocytes (n 454), obtained after laparoscopy, {{were used}} to study in vitro capacitation, fertilization, and embryo development. Capacitation was accomplished by treating bovine spermatozoa with high ionic strength medium. Maturation, fertilization, and development {{studies were carried out}} in Brackett’s defined medium or in Ham’s F-b. In vitro fertilization rates, ranging from 14 % to 55 %, were found to be influenced by individual variations among males. Srackett’s defined medium was found to be superior to Ham’s F-b for oocyte maturation, fertiliza-tion, and growth, these media giving cleavage rates of 60 % and 32 %, respectively. Oocytes with expanded <b>cumuli</b> at the time of recovery cleaved at a rate of 43 %, which is significantly different from oocytes recovered without granulosa cells (22 %) or oocytes with compact <b>cumuli</b> and corona cells (5 %).

5|$|On September 27, 2012, Savage's {{talk show}} left the airwaves after {{he won a}} legal battle with Talk Radio Network, his {{longtime}} employer, and his attorney said discussions with new networks were under way.

40|$|Shallow <b>cumuli</b> {{over land}} are {{normally}} studied from a diurnal perspective. However, the thermodynamic vertical {{profiles of the}} morning transition may {{play an important role}} in setting up favourable conditions for the formation of shallow <b>cumuli.</b> In turn, these profiles are highly dependent on the evolution of the nocturnal boundary characteristics and of their layer aloft. By analysing thermodynamic profiles measured by radiosondes launched every three hours at four different stations, we are able to determine how horizontal advection and turbulent mixing modify the atmospheric stability and the differences in potential temperature and specific humidity at the interface between the atmospheric boundary layer and the layer above it. Two consecutive nights are studied. They show very similar boundary-layer development; but variations in the layer aloft by a low-level-jet advection event during the second night, and intense turbulent mechanical mixing, lead to the development of two diurnal boundary layers with very different characteristics: the first one clear, the second cloudy. To complete the observational study, we perform a sensitivity analysis using a mixed-layer model to examine the role of the morning initial conditions in the formation of shallow <b>cumuli</b> over land. The complexity and subtlety of the observed situation - namely, the interaction of a strongly-mixed nocturnal boundary layer and horizontal advection - make this case suitable for testing the capacity of mesoscale models to reproduce cloudy boundary layers that are largely dependent on conditions during the previous night...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} solve draught problems, a {{precipitation}} augmentation experiment {{based on a}} new airborne liquid carbon dioxide （LC） seeding at low level of supercooled convective clouds, {{was carried out in}} the northern Kyushu, February 2, 1999.

This wind was very strong and cloud bands consisting of many <b>cumuli</b> ranged at constant interval above the Genkai Sea. Under the weather condition, three seedings were carried out. The second and third seedings resulted in rainfall of approximately 1. 3 million tons during the lifetime of the seeded <b>cumuli.</b> At the same time, unique, large mushroom-shaped radar echoes were discovered in the range height indicator （RHI） scans of Kyushu University （KU） radar for the plan position indicator （PPI) echoes near the maxima, which has never been observed among natural clouds.

5|$|The {{first stage}} of a {{thunderstorm}} is the <b>cumulus</b> stage or developing stage. During this stage, masses of moisture are lifted upwards into the atmosphere. The trigger for this lift can be solar illumination, where the heating of the ground produces thermals, or where two winds converge forcing air upwards, or where winds blow over terrain of increasing elevation. The moisture carried upward cools into liquid drops of water due to lower temperatures at high altitude, which appear as <b>cumulus</b> clouds. As the water vapor condenses into liquid, latent heat is released, which warms the air, causing it to become less dense than the surrounding, drier air. The air tends to rise in an updraft {{through the process of}} convection (hence the term convective precipitation). This process creates a low-pressure zone within and beneath the forming thunderstorm. In a typical thunderstorm, approximately 500 million kilograms of water vapor are lifted into the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Convective rain, or showery precipitation, occurs from {{convective}} clouds (e.g., cumulonimbus or <b>cumulus</b> congestus). It falls as showers with {{rapidly changing}} intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain {{area for a}} relatively short time, as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Most precipitation in the tropics appears to be convective; however, {{it has been suggested}} that stratiform precipitation also occurs. Graupel and hail indicate convection. In mid-latitudes, convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold fronts, squall lines, and warm fronts.|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Three examples of cloud-interpretation from ERTS- 1 pictures are presented.

40|$|The {{potential}} use of continental fair-weather shallow <b>cumuli</b> {{as a way}} {{to retrieve}} the daily surface evaporative fraction over land is evaluated in convective conditions. The proposed method utilizes the fact that both the timing of cloud occurrence and the cloud base height at the time of occurrence provide strong constraints on the surface energy balance and evaporative fraction. The retrieval is especially reliable in the presence of relatively stable and humid free troposphere profiles. The advantage of the method is that it provides a more direct estimate of the surface evaporative fraction than indirect estimation based on inversion of a highly parameterized land surface model. In addition, the evaporative fraction is obtained at a scale of a few kilometers, which is more pertinent for weather and climate studies. The retrieval strategy is tested and validated for three contrasting climates: the U. S. southern Great Plains, West Africa, and the Netherlands. We suggest that the use of satellite observations of shallow <b>cumuli</b> can help constrain the retrieval of the surface evaporative fraction within a data assimilation scheme/reanalysi...|$|R

5|$|The {{liquid water}} density within a <b>cumulus</b> cloud {{has been found}} to change with height above the cloud base rather than being {{approximately}} constant throughout the cloud.
