Four hundred and eighty recordings were made on five trucks equipped with four different types of tyres and a 'normal ' or an 'anti-vibration ' seat, driven while empty or loaded, on a smooth or a rough track by three workers. An analysis of variance was performed to study the main effects and the significant interactions between these factors. A mathematical model is proposed for the weighted acceleration on the floor and on the seat in the vertical axis. This shows quantitatively that the vibration exposure is mainly influenced by the roughness of the track, the speed {{and the quality of the}} seat. Inflated tyres are preferable when an anti-vibration seat with a very low resonance frequency is used. In other cases, <b>cushion</b> <b>tyres</b> are more indicated...|$|E
500|$|Like all German tanks, the Tiger II had a petrol engine; in {{this case}} the same 700 PS (690hp, 515kW) V-12 Maybach HL 230 P30 which powered the much lighter Panther and Tiger I tanks. The Tiger II was under-powered, like many other heavy tanks of World War II, and {{consumed}} a lot of fuel, which was in short supply for the Germans. The transmission was the Maybach OLVAR EG 40 12 16 Model B, giving eight forward gears and four reverse, which drove the steering gear. This was the Henschel L 801, a double radius design which proved susceptible to failure. Transverse torsion bar suspension supported the hull on nine axles per side. Overlapped [...] diameter road wheels with rubber <b>cushions</b> and steel <b>tyres</b> rode inside the tracks.|$|R
