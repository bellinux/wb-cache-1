5|$|At 9:00pm three Guards regiments {{arrived on}} the scene. Although the troops {{assisted}} in <b>crowd</b> <b>control,</b> their arrival was also a reaction of the authorities to fears of a possible insurrection, for which the destruction of parliament could have signalled the first step. The three European revolutions of 1830—the French, Belgian and Polish actions—were still of concern, as were the unrest from the Captain Swing riots, and the recent passing of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, which altered the relief provided by the workhouse system.|$|E

By 1994, Fort Ord closed and the 7th Infantry Division subsequently relocated to Fort Lewis, Washington. Elements of the division including the 2nd Brigade participated in one final mission in the United States before inactivation; quelling the 1992 Los Angeles Riots, called Operation Garden Plot. The division's soldiers patrolled the streets of Los Angeles to act as <b>crowd</b> <b>control</b> and supported the Los Angeles Police Department and California National Guard in preventing the riots from escalating in violence.

5|$|The {{original}} engine propelling {{the carousel}} was a belt-driven mechanism, {{but after the}} initial restoration it was exchanged for a fluid drive provided by the Kissell Brothers Amusement Rides company of Cincinnati, Ohio, who suggested the platform for the carousel be improved. To provide <b>crowd</b> <b>control,</b> a pavilion was built over the carousel and a ticket booth was installed. Neither was based on any extant buildings, but each was a composite of several other structures.

5|$|For another episode for {{the series}} filmed in New York City he {{was asked by the}} NYPD not to pre-announce the performance, as <b>crowd</b> <b>control</b> for some Angel {{performances}} had become a concern for the police. This trick saw Angel hanging his feet, while bound with two straitjackets and a noose around his neck which were attached to metal weights. While he was successful in the trick, Angel tore his shoulder muscles and this required surgery in January 2014. This resulted in the temporary closing of the Believe stage show between January and April 2014, while he was recovering from the surgery and returning to performance shape. He did however host a new stage show featuring other magicians between February and March 2014 in lieu of performing in his own show. Clips from the show also became the most watched YouTube magic clips {{in the history of the}} site, with more than 15 million views.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, {{at the end}} of his five-year {{contract}} with the newspaper, Ponsford successfully applied for a position on the staff of the Melbourne Cricket Club. He was appointed to an unspecified office job working for the club secretary Hugh Trumble, which required him to transfer his cricket and baseball allegiances from St Kilda to Melbourne. The Herald unsuccessfully tried to retain his services, and Keith Murdoch—the Editor-in-Chief of the Herald, and later, the father of Rupert Murdoch—visited the Ponsford home to lobby against the move. Ponsford's new role included managing the staffing arrangements and <b>crowd</b> <b>control</b> at the Melbourne Cricket Ground for Australian rules football and cricket matches. In 1956, following the retirement of Vernon Ransford, Ponsford unsuccessfully applied for the position of club secretary, effectively its chief executive officer and one of the most prestigious positions in Australian cricket. However, in the event recently retired Test cricketer Ian Johnson was appointed to the position. Ponsford remained with the club until his retirement in June 1969.|$|E

5|$|The crisis {{escalated}} into {{violence in}} late April. On 24 April, the petitioners {{and some of}} their supporters held a four-day demonstration outside the Government Palace in Dili calling for the establishment of an independent commission to address their grievances. Violence broke out on 28 April when some of the petitioners and gangs of youths who had joined the protest attacked the Government Palace. The PNTL failed to contain the protest and the Palace was badly damaged. After violence spread to other areas of Dili, Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri requested that the F-FDTL help restore order. Troops with no experience in <b>crowd</b> <b>control</b> were deployed to Dili on 29 April and three deaths resulted. On 3 May Major Alfredo Reinado, the commander of the F-FDTL's military police unit, and most of his soldiers including Lt Gastão Salsinha abandoned their posts in protest at what they saw as the army's deliberate shooting of civilians.|$|E
5|$|There are 30,200 {{officers}} {{under the}} prefecture, and {{a fleet of}} more than 6,000 vehicles, including police cars, motorcycles, fire trucks, boats and helicopters. In addition to traditional police duties, the local police monitors the number of discount sales held by large stores (no more than two a year are allowed) and verify that, during summer holidays, at least one bakery is open in every neighbourhood. The national police has its own special unit for riot control and <b>crowd</b> <b>control</b> and security of public buildings, called the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité (CRS), a unit formed in 1944 right after the liberation of France.

5|$|There {{are certain}} jobs that horses do very well, and no {{technology}} has yet developed to fully replace them. For example, mounted police horses are still effective for {{certain types of}} patrol duties and <b>crowd</b> <b>control.</b> Cattle ranches still require riders on horseback to round up cattle that are scattered across remote, rugged terrain. Search and rescue organizations in some countries depend upon mounted teams to locate people, particularly hikers and children, and to provide disaster relief assistance. Horses {{can also be used}} in areas where it is necessary to avoid vehicular disruption to delicate soil, such as nature reserves. They may also be the only form of transport allowed in wilderness areas. Horses are quieter than motorized vehicles. Law enforcement officers such as park rangers or game wardens may use horses for patrols, and horses or mules may also be used for clearing trails or other work in areas of rough terrain where vehicles are less effective.|$|E

5|$|There {{are still}} working brewery horses in other areas, such as Wadworth Brewery's Shire horses in Devizes, Wiltshire, but working teams are {{becoming}} increasingly rare. In some areas, such as the New Forest, local farmers and commoners use horses to round up thousands of semi-feral ponies grazing on the open Forest during the drift season, and Britain's mounted police use horses in <b>crowd</b> <b>control,</b> but other than such niche areas, the horse in Britain today is kept almost entirely for recreational purposes. They compete in all equestrian disciplines, carry riders from novice to advanced on trekking and trail-riding holidays, work in riding schools, provide therapy for the disabled, and are much-loved companions and hacks. The horses and riders of Great Britain have won numerous medals for eventing in equestrian sports at the Summer Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|Wembley bosses were {{in dispute}} with {{newsreel}} companies over the broadcast {{rights for the}} 1936 final. Gaumont British Film Company initially had offered £900 to film inside the ground, but this was refused by the authorities who wanted a sum of £1,500.

A solution could not be reached, and the media were banned from inside of the stadium. To get around the ban and be able to report on the match, a number of autogyros were hired to fly the reporters over the stadium giving them a birds–eye view of the match, with the only filming inside Wembley conducted by the official stadium cameraman. Autogyros had been used to film the final in 1935, and also by the Metropolitan police for <b>crowd</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
5|$|The police {{presence}} in the District of Columbia temporarily doubled, augmented {{by the addition of}} 8,000police officers from around the United States. The police force was assisted by 1,000FBI agents to provide security for the event, and the Secret Service Countersniper team was assigned to hidden locations throughout the area. The Transportation Security Administration had over 300 officers from its National Deployment Force on hand to assist the Secret Service with security inspections of attendees entering the National Mall. Ten thousand National Guard troops were on site, with 5,000troops providing security duty in a ceremonial capacity and 1,300unarmed troops aiding Park Police in <b>crowd</b> <b>control</b> at the National Mall.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the anti-stress effect of the dietary humate and organic acid supplementation on laying hens when subjected to high stocking density as a social stress factor. A total of hundred, 40 weeks, brown laying hens were housed at two different stocking densities of 287. 7 (high density) and 500 (low density) cm 2 /hen. For the control group, 16 hens were randomly assigned to 4 groups, 4 replicates of 4 birds each and were kept in low density. The control group received a basal diet. The remaining 84 hens were divided into 3 treatment groups, 4 replicates of 7 birds each and were housed at high density. The treatment group were fed either a basal diet (<b>crowded</b> <b>control)</b> or the basal diet supplemented with either 0. 15 humate (Humate group) or 0. 20 % organic acid (organic acid group) of diet for 60 days. The results show that in hens kept in high density heterophils and Heterophil to Lymphocyte (H:L) ratios, an indicator of stress were raised while lymphocytes decreased. Humate supplementation resulted in significant increases in the lymphocyte counts and significant decreases in the heterophil counts and H:L ratios compared with those of the <b>crowded</b> <b>control.</b> The heterophils, lymphocytes and H:L ratio were not influenced by organic acid treatment. The present results suggest that humate supplementation to diet may be a favorable alternative for help poultry to cope with social stresses...|$|R

The communication between these modules are made through a Client/Server system. Finally, all lowlevel virtual human actions are delegated to a single motion and behavioural control module. Our architecture combines various human and object simulation aspects, based on the coherent extraction and classification of information from a virtual city database. This architecture is discussed in this paper, together with a detailled case-study example...|$|R
50|$|Through time, the {{numerous}} independent Comstock mines became consolidated under ownership of large monopolies. The “Bank Crowd,” dominated by William Sharon in Virginia City and William Ralston in San Francisco, financed the mines and mills of the Comstock {{until they had}} a virtual monopoly. By manipulating stock through rumors and false reports of mining wealth, some men made fortunes from the stocks of Virginia City’s mines. When it appeared the Comstock Lode was finished, the city's population declined sharply, with ten thousand leaving in 1864 and 1865. By the late 1860s, a group of Irish investors threatened the Bank <b>Crowd’s</b> <b>control.</b> John Mackay and partner James Fair began as common miners, working their way up to management positions in the mines. By purchasing stock in the mines, they realized financial independence. Their partners Flood and O’Brien stayed in San Francisco and speculated in stock. The Irish Big Four, as the men were called, eventually controlled the Consolidated Virginia mine where the “Big Bonanza” was discovered in 1873. The next few years {{were some of the}} most profitable on the Comstock, as the Bank <b>Crowd</b> lost <b>control</b> to the Irish Big Four. Population reached 25,000 in 1875.|$|R
