50|$|Thermal Transfer is {{a popular}} print process {{particularly}} used for the printing of identification labels. It is {{the most widely used}} printing process in the world for the printing of high quality barcodes.The thermal transfer print process utilises three main components: a non-movable print head, a <b>carbon</b> <b>ribbon</b> (the ink) and a substrate to be printed, which would typically be paper, synthetics, card or textile materials. These three components effectively form a sandwich with the ribbon in the middle.A thermally compliant print head, in combination with the electrical properties of the ribbon and the correct rheological properties of the ribbon ink are all essential in producing a high quality printed image.|$|E

We find that in case of metallic graphene ribbons of finite length (rectangular graphene macromolecules) or nanotubes of finite length the discrete energy spectrum in the vicinity of ε= 0 (Fermi energy) can be obtained exactly by selecting levels from the same dispersion law. In case of a semiconducting graphene macromolecule or a semiconducting nanotube of finite length the positions of energy levels around the energy gap can be approximated with a good accuracy.

40|$|Abstract. We {{determined}} the carbon structures in condensed soot samples of variable C/H ratio by using both scanning and transmission electron microscopy. We identified {{several types of}} carbon structures. All the samples are formed mainly by “chainlike aggregates ” of amorphous grains. A small amount of more ordered forms of carbon is also detected. A “poorly graphitized carbon ” is formed on a pre-existing amorphous carbon substrate due to auto-annealing. “Bucky-carbons ” are “proper” products of condensation. Occasionally, rare graphitic <b>carbon</b> <b>ribbons</b> and single-crystal <b>carbon</b> platelets are observed. The “chain-like aggregates ” are the only form sensitive to hydrogen content variations and, probably, the main form responsible for the UV spectral response. In agreement with previous analyses on similar soot samples, we conclude that the internal structure of the amorphous grains drives the overall spectroscopic properties of hydrogenated soots. The relations between structural and spectral trends, common to several kinds of soot samples, suggest that carbon ordered on a micro-scale only, rather than graphitic carbons, is more appropriate to interpret the interstellar UV extinction bump position. The carbon forms, “proper” products of soot condensation processes, {{are similar to those}} detected in chondritic interplanetary dust particles. This could imply that they are of primary origin, rather than derived from parent body processing...|$|R

Flexible materials are widely employed for these applications due to the diversity of body shapes to which the sensors are attached and the variability of strain in action. Recent progress on the material systems includes graphene ripples on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates [8], Si/Ge nanowire matrix on polyimide substrates [3], Pt-coated polymer nanofibers sandwiched between PDMS sheets [9], Si nanoribbons on polyimide substrates [10], <b>carbon</b> nanotube <b>ribbons</b> embedded in PDMS [11], ZnO nanowire/polystyrene hybrid structure on PDMS [12], and graphene on PDMS [13].
