40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of using computers in writing instruction on writing apprehension and attitude toward writing with the computer. Possible correlates of writing apprehension considered {{in the study were}} gender and GPA. Possible correlates of attitude toward writing with the computer were gender and the number of courses taken requiring in-class use of the computer. Analyses were conducted to determine if there was any correlation between the test instruments and to identify differences between the computer treatment group, the non-treatment comparison group, and an advanced placement group. Riverview High School seniors and advanced placement juniors (N= 234) who were enrolled in English classes in the 1991 fall quarter were tested before and after completing nine weeks of writing instruction. Data about the subjects 2 ̆ 7 writing attitudes and attitudes toward writing with the computer were collected by means of standardized scales, and demographic data for the subjects was obtained from a survey and the Riverview guidance department. Hypotheses were tested at a. 05 confidence level using paired t-tests for dependent samples, unpaired t-tests for independent samples, Pearson product moment correlation coefficients, or analysis of variance. Because the analysis of variance indicated differences in writing attitude among the groups, a Scheffe F-test and a Fisher PLSD test were used to determine where the differences occurred. Of the possible correlates of writing apprehension tested, only gender was found to be significant. No correlates were found to be related significantly to attitude toward writing with the computer, and no significant correlation was found between the scales. Differences between the mean writing attitude scores and mean attitude toward writing with the computer scores were identified. Scores increased significantly in the computer treatment group on the Writing Attitude Scale (WAS) and the Attitude toward Writing with the <b>Computer</b> <b>Scale</b> (ATWCS). On both scales, posttest scores of the grade 12 treatment group were also significantly higher than those of the non-treatment grade 12 group. Scores did not increase significantly in the non-treatment group on the Writing Attitude Scale, but did increase significantly on the Attitude toward Writing with the <b>Computer</b> <b>Scale,</b> although the treatment group scores were still significantly higher. Several curriculum recommendations were made based upon the results of this study.

40|$|An intense {{effort is}} being made today to build a quantum computer. Instead of {{presenting}} what has been achieved, I invoke here analogies {{from the history of}} science in an attempt to glimpse what the future might hold. Quantum computing is possible in principle - there are no known laws of Nature that prevent it - yet scaling up the few qubits demonstrated so far has proven to be exceedingly difficult. While this could be regarded merely as a technological or practical impediment, I argue that this difficulty might be a symptom of new laws of physics waiting to be discovered. I also introduce a distinction between "strong" and "weak" emergentist positions. The former assumes that a critical value of a parameter exists (one that is most likely related to the complexity of the states involved) at which the quantum-mechanical description breaks down, in other words, that quantum mechanics {{will turn out to be}} an incomplete description of reality. The latter assumes that quantum mechanics will remain as a universally valid theory, but that the classical resources required to build a real quantum <b>computer</b> <b>scale</b> up with the number of qubits, which hints that a limiting principle is at work.

Grouped amongst the emerging {{economies of the}} world, South Africa's information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure is often mentioned {{as one of the}} key factors leading to the growth of the country. Integrating ICT into education has become a priority for the South African government. However, it is necessary to move beyond merely providing physical access to ICT's in order for integration to be successful. The integration of ET in schools is greatly influenced by teachers' attitudes towards the technology. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate teachers' attitudes towards educational technology and the factors that are thought to influence teachers' attitudes, namely, perceived usefulness, perceived cultural relevance, perceived competence and access to ET. A convenience sample of 117 teachers in the Johannesburg area, from both public and private schools, across foundation, intermediate and senior phase, completed the Attitudes Towards <b>Computer</b> <b>Scale.</b> Teachers' attitudes were generally positive. The strongest predictor of teachers' attitudes was perceived usefulness followed by perceived cultural relevance.

One disadvantage of these computers is {{the small size of}} their display screens, which may reduce the resolution of responses available as compared with standard display screens. One plausible solution to this problem is to use a scale that expands contingent on an initial response made by the subject, so that the final response is made from a scale with finer resolution. To validate this approach, we compared taste intensity judgments of six sucrose solutions (0. 03, 0. 06, 0. 12, 0. 24, 0. 48, and 0. 96 M), using a labeled magnitude scale either presented in expandable form on a palmtop computer (Palm scale) or in conventional (nonexpandable) form on a standard 17 $ PC monitor (PC scale). Twenty-four subjects rated all six sucrose solutions thrice, using both scale types, the different scales being used on different days of testing. The scales led to very similar taste intensity ratings at all but the lowest concentration, which was rated less intense on the Palm scale. The Palm scale was used with slightly less precision than the PC scale for the weakest solution concentrations. In summary, the responses of the two scales were similar enough to validate the use of the expandable scale on the palmtop computer outside the laboratory setting.

Purpose: To describe a modification of the <b>Computer</b> Self Efficacy <b>Scale</b> for use in clinical settings and to report on the modified scale’s reliability and construct validity. Methods: The <b>Computer</b> Self Efficacy <b>Scale</b> was modified to make it applicable for clinical settings (for use with older people or people with disabilities using everyday technologies). The modified scale was piloted, then tested with patients in an Australian inpatient rehabilitation setting (n= 88) to determine the internal consistency using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. Construct validity was assessed by correlation of the scale with age and technology use. Factor analysis using principal components analysis was undertaken to identify important constructs within the scale. Results: The modified <b>Computer</b> Self Efficacy <b>scale</b> demonstrated high internal consistency with a standardised alpha coefficient of 0. 94. Two constructs within the scale were apparent; using the technology alone, and using the technology with the support of others.

40|$|Modern <b>computer</b> <b>scaling</b> {{trends in}} pursuit of larger {{component}} counts and power efficiency have, unfortunately, lead to less reliable hardware and consequently soft errors escaping into application data ("silent data corruptions"). Techniques to enhance system resilience hinge {{on the availability of}} efficient error detectors that have high detection rates, low false positive rates, and lower computational overhead. Unfortunately, efficient detectors to detect faults during address generation (to index large arrays) have not been widely researched. We present a novel lightweight compiler-driven technique called PRESAGE for detecting bit-flips affecting structured address computations. A key insight underlying PRESAGE is that any address computation scheme that flows an already incurred error is better than a scheme that corrupts one particular array access but otherwise (falsely) appears to compute perfectly. Enabling the flow of errors allows one to situate detectors at loop exit points, and helps turn silent corruptions into easily detectable error situations.

The scaling method presented is an adaptation of the method of scaling MST Doppler spectra presented by Rastogi (1984). A brief overview of this method is as follows: a median spectrum is calculated from several sequential spectra; the median noise value is subtracted from this derived spectrum; the median spectrum is smoothed; the detection/nondetection decision is made by comparing the smoothed spectrum to the variance of the smoothed noise; and if a signal is detected, then the half-power points of the smoothed echo spectrum are used to place limits on the evaluation of the first two moments of the unsmoothed median spectrum. In all of the above steps, the algorithm is guided by tracing the expected velocity range upward from the lowest range as far as possible. The method is discussed in more detail...|$|R
