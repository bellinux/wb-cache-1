40|$|Barely a {{month before}} Justice Brockholst Livingston joined the Supreme Court of the United States, a ship he {{commissioned}} with a cargo of $ 50, 000, was captured by the British and condemned. The circumstances of the vessel’s voyage led to its capture; she sailed as an American merchant ship under a Spanish license with an American crew. When seized as a prize, the British found papers showing conflicting information concealed amongst the <b>crew</b> <b>belongings.</b> Justice Livingston tried to recoup his losses through an insurance policy with the Maryland Insurance Company, but was denied {{on the grounds that}} the voyage had been insured under false pretense.
