Five types of exposures are discussed: whole-body chambers, head-only exposures, nose or mouth-only methods, lung-only exposures, and partial-lung exposures. Design considerations covered include: air cleaning and conditioning; construction materials; losses of exposure materials; evenness of exposure; sampling biases; animal observation and care; noise and vibration control, safe exhausts, chamber loading, reliability, pressure fluctuations; neck seals, masks, <b>animal</b> <b>restraint</b> methods; and <b>animal</b> comfort.

Objective performance variables evaluated were, speed of application, human resource and input cost, <b>animal</b> <b>restraint</b> required, and failure rate. Subjective evaluation of esthetics and difficulty of application indicated manual blunt force trauma is an unacceptable technique.

40|$|Inhaled {{administration}} of test materials to animals has technical challenges for quantitative dosimetry. Inhaled “doses” reported in non-clinical studies are often calculated using an equation {{such as that}} of Alexander et al. [1] to estimate the respired minute volume (eRMV) from body weight data. This approach may overlook physiological effects on lung function associated with a formulation’s properties or habituation of animals to the “dosing” technique. Rats are insensitive to red light [2] and anecdotal data (unpublished) suggested red lighting may induce a calmer state in restrained rats. We hypothesized that the lighting color (red or white) and duration of <b>restraint</b> <b>tube</b> acclimation protocols may influence the breath frequency and minute volume of rats during inhalation exposure, representing a potential source of variability in achieved doses. Head-out plethysmography [3] was used to investigate this hypothesis concurrent with inhaled {{administration of}} an anti-inflammatory drug...|$|R
40|$|Empathy is when an observer’s {{understanding}} of an individual’s affective state causes that observer {{to experience the}} same affective state. Understanding whether nonhuman animals experience emotions {{in a similar way}} to humans is valuable for animal research and ethical reasons. Empathy or empathy-like behavior has been concluded by researchers studying a variety of social mammals (e. g., apes, Jensen et al., 2006; elephants, Byrne et al., 2008; dogs, Custance & Mayer, 2012) Ben-Ami Bartal et al. (2011) found that rats freed their cagemates from a <b>restraint</b> <b>tube,</b> and concluded rats also have empathy. This garnered two main criticisms: 1. Freeing behavior could be explained by the donor’s desire for social contact, NOT empathy (Silberberg et al., 2014) 2.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the relationship between the anti-stress and hepato-protective effects of Schisandra Lignans Extract (SLE) on stress-induced liver damage. Seven weeks old male mice were fixed in a <b>restraint</b> <b>tube</b> for 18 [*]h to induce liver damage. SLE was orally administered to animals for 5 days at dosages of 100 and 200 [*]mg/kg/day before exposed to restraint stress. Oral administration of SLE significantly reduced restraint-induced liver damage in experimental animal. SLE was further found to significantly alleviate the provocation of corticosterone in stressed mice. SLE also significantly decreased oxidative damage and increased anti-oxidative capability of liver cells by preventing the over production and accumulation of free radicals. In conclusion, the protective effects of SLE on stress-induced liver damage were confirmed, and the correlation between hepatoprotective and anti-stress effects of schisandra lignans was possible related to its alleviation on the malignant effects of stressors for bio-homeostasis, such as balance of oxidation and reduction in cells...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{restraint}} stress on heart activity, blood catecholamines {{and the development}} of myocardial necrosis were studied in five unoperated and five unsuccessfully amygdalectomized (sham-operated) pigs and compared with six bilaterally amygdalectomized pigs. In the sham-operated and the nonoperated <b>animals,</b> <b>restraint</b> stress often provoked intense tachycardia, as well as considerable elevations of blood catecholamines, particularly noradrenaline, associated with more or less widespread foci of myocardial necrosis. In contrast, the same restraint produced only minor heart rate increase in the six completely amygdalectomized animals; their blood noradrenaline levels were significantly lower and no myocardial necrosis could be detected, either macro- or microscopically. The results indicate that the amygdaloid part of the limbic system and the sympathoadrenal system are of importance in the induction of myocardial necrosis often noted in pigs when exposed to situations of severe mental stress...|$|R
40|$|Objective(s) It is {{well known}} that {{prenatal}} stresses (PS) induce a variety of neurobiological and behavioral alterations, some of them involving the hippocampal formation. This study aimed to determine whether restraint stress influences the neuronal volume and number of granule cells in the hippocampus of adult rat offspring. Materials and Methods Ten Wistar pregnant rats were randomly divided: stressed and control groups. Pregnant dams in the stressed group were placed in a Plexiglas <b>restraint</b> <b>tube</b> for 1 hr daily from days 15 - 21 of gestation. Neuroendocrinological consequences of prenatal stress exposure were evaluated in the male offspring on postnatal day 60.

40|$|Short-term {{stressors}} such as {{transport and}} slaughter include {{psychological and physical}} stimuli that might be aversive for the <b>animals.</b> <b>Restraint,</b> manipulation and sudden change lead to fear, or psychological stress, while hunger, thirst, fatigue, injury and extreme thermal conditions are considered as physical stresses. Animal responses to these stimuli include behavioural and physiological changes devoted to coping with adverse situations. If the recovery or the adaptation fails, the consequences can be extremely serious, ranging from weight loss and death to impaired carcass and meat quality. As the stress during transport and slaughter is unavoidable, only {{the knowledge of the}} physiological and behavioural needs of the animals during all procedures from pre-transport handling to stunning, together with the correct use of the facilities for handling and transportation, can minimize the intensity and the duration of stress.

The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate the potential involvement of catecholamines and adrenoceptors in the regulation of acute restraint stress-induced liver injury. Restraint was achieved by placing mice in <b>restraint</b> <b>tubes.</b> Mice were treated with either an a-l antagonist, prazosin, an a- 2 antagonist, yohimbine, a b-l antagonist, betaxolol, a b- 2 antagonist, ICI 118551, or a central and peripheral catecholamine depleting agent, reserpine, and followed by restraint stress. Assessment of liver injury (serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), hepatic total GSH, GSSG and GSH/ GSSG ratio), histopathology and of apoptosis, by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling) assay and western blotting, was performed. Three hours of restraint stress resulted in liver injury, as indexed by elevated serum transaminase levels, decreased hepatic total GSH levels and GSH/GSSG ratio, increased hepatic GSSG levels as well as enhanced hepatocytes apoptosis. Either reserpine or prazosin or yohimbine was found to attenuate liver injury. Furthermore, prazosin and yohimbine protected against restraint-induced hepatocytes apoptosis through attenuating the activation of caspases- 9 and- 3 and reducing the Bax/Bcl- 2 ratio.

Materials and Methods: Animals were categorized into four groups, viz., wild Indian spectacled cobra (n= 10), wild Indian rat snakes (n= 10), captive Indian spectacled cobra (n= 10), and captive Indian rat snake (n= 10). The snakes were restrained with <b>restraint</b> <b>tubes,</b> and 2 ml of blood was collected from either heart or ventral coccygeal vein. Hematological examinations were performed manually and serum biochemistry assays were performed on semi-automated clinical chemistry analyzer. Results: The values of total erythrocyte count, packed cell volume, and hemoglobin were slightly low in captive spectacled cobras and captive rat snakes compared to wild ones, whereas total leukocyte count was found to be slightly high in wild spectacled cobras compared to captive ones. All the recorded values of biochemical and electrolyte analytes were found to be well within expected range for snakes except for total protein and chloride levels in both the species which was slightly above the expected range. Conclusion: The hematology and serum biochemistry intervals of the two most common Indian snakes are presented here. The data will be useful in routine health evaluations and aiding in better medical management of the species studied. Since this study is the first to report complete hematologic and blood biochemical ranges for the study species, observations made here can also be used as referral intervals for future use...|$|R
