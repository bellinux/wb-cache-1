40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to produce liqueurs from "minor" citrus fruits, such as kumquat and grapefruit, {{characterize}} their volatile fraction and evaluate their acceptability by a <b>consumer</b> <b>test.</b> A limoncello sample (LP) was produced under the same conditions and used for comparison.

Liqueur from kumquat peel (KP) was the richest in volatile compounds, whereas the one from kumquat whole fruit (KWF) was the poorest. This latter also had the particular feature to be the richest in sesquiterpene alcohols. Octanal and decanal, and two acetals deriving from these aldehydes (1, 1 -diethoxyoctane and 1, 1 -diethoxydecane) were most prevalent in KP and LP.

40|$|An {{optimized}} formulation {{was developed}} for the preparation of an ‘ice-sage tea ’ which might {{be considered to be}} a new healthy functional product and designed as an alternative to other cold-served drinks in the market. A central composite design was used for modeling of the experiment with two independent variables (extraction time and blending ratios of two different sage varieties: Salvia officinalis (SO) and Salvia sclarea (SC)). Flavor profile of this novel product was developed using descriptive sensory analysis techniques; consumer acceptability of the product was also tested. Blending SO with SC was expected to increase the positive health effects of this novel product, while there was a limit for its concentration at increased extraction times. According to the evaluation of experienced panelists, blending common sage SO with SC did not reduce the overall likeability of this novel product at low extraction times. Statistically, just two models for astringency and overall impression were found to be acceptable by taking into con-sideration their regression coefficient and probability values. On the other hand, <b>consumer</b> <b>test</b> results showed that the samples prepared by blending SO with SC up to 25 % might increase the likeability scores of the product when compared to the product without SC.

40|$|In November 2009, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System issued {{regulations}} that protect consumers from being charged certain fees when, under a discretionary overdraft service, financial institutions pay transactions from a deposit account that contains insufficient funds. Under the regulations, consumers must receive notices that explain any discretionary overdraft services offered {{to them by}} their bank. In addition, consumers may not be charged overdraft fees for ATM or one-time debit transactions unless they have opted in to this service. During the rulemaking process, the Board extensively interviewed <b>consumers</b> and <b>tested</b> model notices to understand how consumers think about and use overdraft services.

Irradiation increased the production of acetaldehyde, 3 -methyl-buta-nal, 2 -methyl-butanal, and total volatiles in turkey rolls but had little effect on other aldehydes. Irradiation also produced new volatiles, including sulfur compounds, not detected in nonirradiated turkey breast rolls.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Product {{rejection}} {{of a new}} innovative product {{is one of the}} major uncertainties for high volume consumer companies. It is well known that some of the field failures are consequences of unexpected consumer behavior [Brombacher (1999) ]. Conventional in house tests, during product development have not been able to fully prevent product rejections. This paper describes a new consumer testing concept called the high contrast <b>consumer</b> <b>test,</b> which tries to deal with unexpected consumer behavior. This new consumer testing concept was attempted in a company that developed an innovative domestic iron. The results showed that this concept for this particular company was able to highlight consumer issues and therefore design issues that the company’s conventional tests could not show...|$|E
40|$|Consumer tests which assess safety {{features}} of modern vehicles have {{a tradition in}} Europe. Recently, such test protocols have been substantially extended to also cover active safety systems like Volkswagen's Front Assist. Objective: Simulations for passive safety systems are already a widely adopted approach during vehicle development and internal assessments. As active safety systems are becoming an increasingly important element in a vehicle's safety concept and a differentiating feature, a systematic validation and assessment of such systems is necessary to successfully pass consumer tests and complimentarily identified, relevant traffic scenarios. Method: With this work, we extend our previous conference publication about EuroNCAP CCRs tests by additionally investigating US NCAP scenarios for an AEB system. Therefore, we systematically modeled the allowed variations with a graph where the paths represent concrete test scenarios. These paths are used in a virtual test environment to assess the AEB system. In our previous publication, we illustrated our method of test case generation and simulating <b>consumer</b> <b>test</b> scenarios by showing results of 27 specific test cases. In this work, we focused on integrating a test automatization routine as well as evaluating a set of test cases with a factor of 100 compared to our previous paper. Results: We demonstrate the approach for both EuroNCAP's and US NCAP's CCRs scenarios with a total quantity of more than 2, 700 test cases including re-runs to systematically evaluate an AEB algorithm. Our results unveiled varying action points {{in time for the}} same initial values for a given <b>consumer</b> <b>test</b> scenario while applying different allowed variations. Conclusion: We foresee the importance of complementary virtual testing for real-world tests on proving grounds especially during the design phase. Our study shows that already small variations that yet accord with the test procedure specification influence the behavior of - n active safety system and need to be investigated during development and vehicle testing...|$|E
