50|$|The O-type <b>carcinotron,</b> or O-type {{backward}} wave oscillator, uses an electron beam longitudinally focused by a magnetic field, and a slow-wave circuit {{interacting with the}} beam. A collector collects the beam {{at the end of}} the tube.|$|E
50|$|A {{backward}} wave oscillator (BWO), also called <b>carcinotron</b> (a trade name for tubes manufactured by CSF, now Thales) or {{backward wave}} tube, is a vacuum tube {{that is used to}} generate microwaves up to the terahertz range. It belongs to the traveling-wave tube family. It is an oscillator with a wide electronic tuning range.|$|E
5000|$|As {{well as the}} {{frequency}} agility and sheer power the Type 85 had multiple receivers enabling the return signals to be detected through the heaviest jamming, this included [...] "dicky fix" [...] receivers to combat <b>carcinotron</b> jamming. Post reception processing, including double integration loops enabling the comparison and discarding of spurious returns enhanced the ECCM capability still further. Whilst not having the Moving Target Indicator (MTI) facility the Type 84 had, {{the frequency}} band and processing ensured the Type 85 produced a clear picture even under the most arduous conditions.|$|E

25|$|Some tubes, such as magnetrons, traveling-wave tubes, <b>carcinotrons,</b> and klystrons, combine {{magnetic}} and electrostatic effects. These are efficient (usually narrow-band) RF {{generators and}} still find use in radar, microwave ovens and industrial heating. Traveling-wave tubes (TWTs) {{are very good}} amplifiers and are even used in some communications satellites. High-powered klystron amplifier tubes can provide hundreds of kilowatts in the UHF range.|$|R
50|$|Barrage jamming is radio jamming {{accomplished}} by transmitting {{a band of}} frequencies that is large {{with respect to the}} bandwidth of a single emitter. Barrage jamming may be {{accomplished by}} presetting multiple jammers on adjacent frequencies, by using a single wideband transmitter, or by using a transmitter capable of frequency sweep fast enough to appear radiating simultaneously over wide band (e.g. a <b>carcinotron).</b> Barrage jamming makes it possible to jam emitters on different frequencies simultaneously and reduces the need for operator assistance or complex control equipment. These advantages are gained at the expense of reduced jamming power at any given frequency. Barrage jamming has to be used against frequency-agile radars, which change frequencies too quickly to follow them in a conventional way. The use of barrage jamming may also affect the communications capability of the jamming source in a negative fashion.|$|E
50|$|The M-type <b>carcinotron,</b> or M-type {{backward}} wave oscillator, uses crossed static electric field E and magnetic field B, {{similar to the}} magnetron, for focussing an electron sheet beam drifting perpendicularly to E and B, along a slow-wave circuit, with a velocity E/B. Strong interaction occurs when the phase velocity of one space harmonic of the wave {{is equal to the}} electron velocity. Both Ez and Ey components of the RF field are involved in the interaction (Ey parallel to the static E field). Electrons which are in a decelerating Ez electric field of the slow-wave, lose the potential energy they have in the static electric field E and reach the circuit. The sole electrode is more negative than the cathode, in order to avoid collecting those electrons having gained energy while interacting with the slow-wave space harmonic.|$|E

Wadhwa, born on 3 September 1932, {{secured a}} PhD from Indian Institute of Science in 1955 and {{started his career}} at Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute (CEERI) but moved to the US in 1956. In US, he worked at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute as a {{graduate}} teaching Asssistant (1956-58), at EBSCO Information Services as a junior engineer (1957), at IBM and as Engineer (1958-59), at University of Michigan as a research engineer (1959-63), at Litton Industries as a senior engineer (1963-66) and also had a short stint at University of California Extension Service as a part-time teacher. Returning to India in 1966, he resumed his career at CEERI as an assistant director. He served CEERI till 1970 when he was appointed as the deputy general manager of Bharat Electronics Limited and in 1978, he joined the National Physical Laboratory of India as the deputy director, scientist (Grade-F) {{and the head of}} the Test Evaluation and Calibration Centre.

The output {{power of the}} O-type is {{typically}} {{in the range of}} 1 mW at 1000 GHz to 50 mW at 200 GHz. <b>Carcinotrons</b> are used as powerful and stable microwave sources. Due to the good quality wavefront they produce (see below), they find use as illuminators in terahertz imaging.|$|R

The M-type BWO is a voltage-controlled non-resonant {{extrapolation}} of magnetron interaction, both types are tunable {{over a wide}} range of frequencies by varying the accelerating voltage. They can be swept through the band fast enough to be appearing to radiate over all the band at once, which makes them suitable for effective radar jamming, quickly tuning into the radar frequency. <b>Carcinotrons</b> allowed airborne radar jammers to be highly effective. However, frequency-agile radars can hop frequencies fast enough to force the jammer to use barrage jamming, diluting its output power over a wide band and significantly impairing its efficiency.|$|R
40|$|The {{expected}} {{performance of}} a radar equipped with Dicke Fix receiver is assessed {{in the presence of}} various types of FM barrage jamming. The minimum jamming-to-signal ratio for masking the echo signal is related to the received jamming power by a simple analytical expression, and the expected range performance of the radar is derived, assuming that most factors, other than range in the radar and beacon equations, are constants. The results of some radial flights are analyzed to demonstrate the performance against an AN/FPS- 6 radar of a <b>carcinotron</b> FM barrage jammer capable of employing several types of modulation. Comparisons with expected performance are made. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|The {{description}} of an electron accelerator of microsecond pulse duration {{and the results}} of experiments with a relativistic <b>carcinotron</b> and a gyrotron, carried out on its base, is submitted in the report. A three-electrode magnetron-injection gun ' forms a hollow electron beam either with rectilinear or with helical trajectories of electrons, depending on magnitude and configuration of the magnetic field and also on potential distribution at the electrodes. Configuration of the gun electrodes is shown in Fig. 1. The electron beam diameter is in the range of 10 - 40 mm at the wall thickness being in the range of 1 - 4 mm respectively. A relatively low-temperature barium-aluminate cathode maintaining the emission current density to be not less than 10 A/cm 2 at the heating temperature of 1 150 °C, is used. The scheme of the accelerator is shown in Fig. 2. The cathode heating is carried out by a heater which is fed by a transformer with a secondary winding being one turn of a high-voltage cable with 500 kV insulation. The secondary winding passes through 10 toroid cores with primary windings connected in parallel. Heating power is controlled by varying the repetition rate of pulses from a special oscillator 2 The nominal heating power of the cathode with an emitting belt diameter of 100 nim accounts for 1. 2 kW. Fig. 1. Configuration of gun electrodes Mutual disposition of the gun electrodes is fixed by a sectioned insulator that consists of alternating aluminium and porcelain rings. Electric potential is distributed along the insulator sections by a resistive divider with total resistance 10 kQ. O- 8194 - 1581 - 2 / 94 /$ 6. OO SPIE Vol. 2259 / 573 —? 0 1 2 3 4 iriunt...|$|E
