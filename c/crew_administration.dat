50|$|In 1873 {{justice and}} {{administration}} were separated. Now {{the offices of}} court were only responsible for the law. The “administration crews” (Amtshauptmannschaft) {{were responsible for the}} administration. There were four “county administration crews” (Kreishauptmannschaften), which were created as organs of the Saxon government. The county <b>administration</b> <b>crew</b> of Zwickau consisted of the <b>administration</b> <b>crews</b> in Annaberg, Auerbach, Chemnitz, Flöha, Marienberg, Oelsnitz, Plauen, Schwarzenberg and Zwickau.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{with the murder}} {{contract}} on his life, Accetturo was placed under federal protection after being extradited from North Carolina to New Jersey. During this time, Accetturo had little power over the New Jersey faction he had been reportedly stripped of his rank and demoted him to soldier. The Taccetta brothers also had problems with their longtime rival Thomas Ricciardi {{who was trying to}} take over the faction. In 1992 the entire <b>crew's</b> <b>administration</b> Anthony Accetturo, Michael and Martin Taccetta, Thomas Ricciardi and Michael Perna were indicted on racketeering, loansharking, extortion, illegal gambling, drug trafficking, murder and conspiracy to commit murder. In 1993, when the trial began both Accetturo and Ricciardi decided to defect to the government and turn state's evidence testifying against Michael and Martin Taccetta, and Michael Perna.|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} a description and preliminary {{evaluation of a}} nationwide initiative by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) called Civility, Respect, and Engagement in the Workforce (CREW). The goal of CREW is to increase workplace civility as assessed by employee ratings of interpersonal climate in workgroups. Once endorsed by the VHA leadership and adopted by the leaders of particular VHA hospitals, CREW was conducted by local facility coordinators who were trained {{and supported by the}} VHA National Center for Organization Development. This article explains the concep-tual and operational background of CREW and the approach used to implement the initiative, presents results from two <b>CREW</b> <b>administrations</b> with a total of 23 sites, and reports significant preintervention to postintervention changes in civility at interven-tion sites as compared to no significant changes at comparison sites within each admin-istration. It discusses these findings in the conceptual (theoretical) and operational (intervention evaluation) context of interventions targeting civility...|$|R
5000|$|Timars of Kotor's mustafhiz {{were even}} in villages around Visoko, and Visoko's Dubrovnik (probably the main {{commercial}} offices). Hamdija Kreševljaković assumes that mustafhiz [...] "in Kotor {{moved out of}} a city, which was closer to the Visoko". Until 1838, Kotor had its own crew. During the Austrian occupation of the right bank of the Sava, in Kotor is moved <b>crews</b> and <b>administration</b> Kobaška captaincy, which was {{under the jurisdiction of}} the judicial Jajce captaincy.

50|$|After its surrender, the Itata {{was brought}} back to San Diego with its <b>crew.</b> The Harrison <b>Administration</b> {{appointed}} William Howard Taft, the US Solicitor General (and later U.S. President), and Los Angeles-based federal prosecutor Henry Gage (later Governor of California), to investigate the Itata and prosecute its crew and suppliers.|$|R
50|$|Central Park {{was renamed}} Vander Veer after an early Davenport park {{commissioner}} in 1911. In the 1930s Civil Works <b>Administration</b> <b>crews</b> altered the park's plan {{by removing the}} corner entrances at Brady and Lombard Streets and at Harrison and Lombard Streets. The original street lights and the iron fountain were replaced with modern light standards and a stone-and-concrete fountain that was operated electrically.|$|R
50|$|The Plumerville School Building is a {{historic}} school building on Arnold Street in Plumerville, Arkansas. It is a single-story wood frame structure, finished with local fieldstone and covered by a gable roof. Gabled entry pavilions project from the front, supported by stone posts. It is believed that this structure was built for an African-American church congregation about 1925, with a wooden exterior, and was finished in stone during the 1930s by a Works Progress <b>Administration</b> <b>crew.</b>|$|R
50|$|The state {{legislature}} provided additional money in 1895, along with clear instructions to secure acreage {{on the actual}} battlefield, but no action was taken. It wasn't until 1929, following a resurgence of community advocacy, that the state acquired the site and proclaimed it the Birch Cooley Battle Field State Memorial Park. In 1937 a Works Progress <b>Administration</b> <b>crew</b> helped develop the park, reseeding the land and building amenities like trails, roads, picnic area, and a parking lot.|$|R

5000|$|Originally {{centered}} on the falls, Minneopa State Park gained a noncontiguous parcel in 1931 with the donation of the Seppman Mill by the builder's son. Development stagnated during the Great Depression until federal funds provided Works Progress <b>Administration</b> <b>crews.</b> From 1937 to 1940 young men improved the falls area with new stairs, a public shelter, restrooms, maintenance buildings, and other structures all built from local sandstone. [...] A 58 acre district encompassing all seven of these enduring structures is on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|R
50|$|The Wortham Gymnasium was a {{historic}} athletic facility on Arkansas Highway 200 in Oak Grove, a rural community in Nevada County east of Rosston. Built in 1935 by a Works Progress <b>Administration</b> <b>crew,</b> this large gymnasium {{was the only}} surviving remnant of a major push in the 1920s and 1930s to improve the education of African Americans in Oak Grove. It was a single-story wood-frame structure with a gable roof, with a shed-roofed vestibule area on the main (southern) facade. At {{the time of its}} construction, it was the largest gymnasium in the state.|$|R
50|$|During <b>Crew's</b> tenure, his <b>administration</b> was {{marred by}} a 1997 report by Edward F. Stancik, the Special Commissioner of Investigation, which {{questioned}} school administrators for not following procedures and delaying the report of a rape of a 14-year-old girl, which was the third instance in that high school. In response to the report, Crew initiated due process procedures to determine disciplinary action for the administrators involved. Crew was later blamed for organizing efforts to remove independent oversight and engaging in a campaign to have Stancik removed by accusing him of exaggerating his reports saying they were overly dramatic and adversely affected the school system.|$|R
50|$|Grading of {{the line}} was nearly {{complete}} by 1857, and many traces still remain today. Bridge abutments for the crossing of the Little Lehigh Creek were dismantled by Works Project <b>Administration</b> <b>crews</b> in the 1930s. A portion of the grading can still {{be seen on the}} southeast side of the intersection of Cedar Crest Boulevard and Route 222, near Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, and {{on the north side of}} Route 222 between Grange and Krocks Roads. Turning Leaf Trail in Trexlertown and most of Wentz Road in Breinigsville were built on the part of the grade used by the Catasauqua & Fogelsville. Beyond the end of rail in Kutztown, the grade is intermittently intact along the Sacony, and almost continuous from Virginville to Hamburg.|$|R
50|$|After the {{accession}} of James II, Crew {{was also}} appointed Dean of the Chapel Royal on 28 December 1685, staying in post until 1688. He {{was part of}} the ecclesiastical commission of 1686, which suspended Henry Compton, Bishop of London (for refusing to suspend John Sharp, then rector of St Giles's-in-the-Fields, whose anti-papal writings had rendered him obnoxious to the king) and <b>Crew</b> shared the <b>administration</b> of the see of London with Thomas Sprat, Bishop of Rochester. On the decline of King James's power, Crew dissociated himself from the court, and made a bid for the favour of William III's new government by voting for the motion that James had abdicated. He was excepted from the general pardon of 1690, but afterwards was allowed to retain his see.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{method of}} {{rebellion}} {{took the form}} of an unsanctioned group called the Zoo Crew. When printed, the name was usually spelled with the Greek letters ΖΘΘ (zeta theta theta), in an effort to avoid the ban on [...] "Zoo", which also gave the group a fraternity-like appearance. The Zoo Crew was made up of former and current members of the residence, but was never officially associated with Saugeen. The group would organize pub crawls, and would sell a package including drink tickets, shot glasses and clothing with the words [...] "Zoo Crew" [...] on it. Even though a representative from the Zoo <b>Crew</b> argued Western's <b>administration</b> should not be upset about these pub crawls because they were not residents of Saugeen, this loosely run organization eventually dissolved as well.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{contains}} {{a review of}} methods and technologies developed during a research project entitled “Methods of testing and evaluation of grassy airfields”, conducted at the Lublin University of Technology between 2011 and 2014. Based on the terramechanical studies of wheel-soil interactions, the authors have developed a method for the determination of wheel-grass friction and rolling resistance coefficients, which are of critical importance for the ground performance of an airplane. Moreover, a mobile application has been created for use by pilots, controllers or airfield <b>administration</b> <b>crew.</b> The application connects online with a weather service to gather atmospheric data as inputs for a mathematical model that produces a real-time cone index (CI) value for a given airfield. The paper also discusses {{the applicability of the}} method within the air transportation system, as well as possible effects of the described technology upon the safety of flight operations on grassy airfields...|$|R
40|$|On 31 July 2008 the National Aeronautics and Space <b>Administration</b> <b>Crew</b> Exploration Vehicle Parachute Assembly System team {{conducted}} the final planned cluster {{test of the}} first generation parachute recovery system design. The two primary test objectives were to demonstrate the operation of the complete parachute system deployed from a full scale capsule simulator and to demonstrate the test technique of separating the capsule simulator from the Low Velocity Air Drop pallet used to extract the test article from a United States Air Force C- 17 aircraft. The capsule simulator was the Parachute Test Vehicle with an accurate heat shield outer mold line and forward bay compartment of the Crew Exploration Vehicle Command Module. The Parachute Test Vehicle separated cleanly from the pallet following extraction, but failed to reach test conditions resulting in the failure of the test and the loss of the test assets. No personnel were injured. This paper will discuss the design of the test and the findings of the team that investigated the test, including a discussion of what were determined to be the root causes of the failure...|$|R
40|$|Throughout my career, I have {{observed}} many launch vehicle efforts come and go. Although {{it may appear}} on the surface that those were dead-end streets, the knowledge we gained through them actually informs the work in progress. Following the tragic loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia's <b>crew,</b> the <b>administration</b> took the Columbia Accident Investigation Board's findings to heart and united the Agency behind the Vision for Space Exploration, with clear goals and objectives, including fielding {{a new generation of}} safe, reliable, and affordable space transportation. The genesis of the Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle and Ares V Cargo Launch Vehicle activities now under way by a nationwide Government and industry team was the confirmation of the current NASA Administrator in April 2005. Shortly thereafter, he commissioned a team of aerospace experts to conduct the Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS), which gave shape to launch vehicles that will empower America's resurgence in scientific discovery through human and robotic space exploration. In October 2005, I was asked to lead this effort, building the team and forming the partnerships that will, in turn, build America's next human-rated space transportation system. In November 2006, the Ares I team began conducting the System Requirements Review milestone, just 1 year after its formation. We are gaining momentum toward the first test flight of the integrated vehicle system in 2009, just a few short years away. The Agency is now poised to deliver on the commitment this nation has made to advance our interests in space. In its inaugural year, the Ares team has conducted the first human-rated launch vehicle major milestone in over 30 years. Using the Exploration Systems Architecture Study recommendations as a starting point, the vehicle designs have been evolved to best meet customer and stakeholder requirements to fulfill the strategic goals outlined in the Vision for Space Exploration...|$|R
