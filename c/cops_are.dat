5|$|St. Paul, Minnesota: in a store, Clyde Bruckman (Peter Boyle), a life {{insurance}} salesman, purchases a {{paper and a}} lottery ticket and leaves. In the street, he almost bumps into an inconspicuous man (Stuart Charno), who heads to a gypsy palm reader named Madame Zelma (Karin Konoval). After seeking his fortune, the inconspicuous man attacks and kills her. A few days later, the eyes and entrails of a tea leaf reader, {{who was also a}} doll collector, have been found in her apartment, her body being missing. FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrive at the scene of that murder to help the local cops, who have recruited the help of a psychic, the eccentric Stupendous Yappi (Jaap Broeker). Although the psychic delivers extremely vague clues, the <b>cops</b> <b>are</b> thoroughly impressed; both Scully and Mulder, however, are not, especially after Yappi diagnoses that it is Mulder—not Scully—who is a skeptic.|$|E
5|$|After rescuing Camille from Medrano, Bond follows Greene to a {{performance}} of Tosca in Bregenz, Austria. Meanwhile, {{the head of the}} CIA's South American section, Gregg Beam (David Harbour), strikes a noninterference deal with Greene for access to putative stocks of Bolivian oil. Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, identifying members of Quantum's executive board, and a gunfight ensues. A Special Branch bodyguard working for Quantum member Guy Haines (Paul Ritter), is killed by antagonists after Bond throws him off a roof. M assumes Bond killed him, and has Bond's passports and credit cards revoked. Bond heads to Italy and convinces his old ally René Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) to accompany him to Bolivia. They are greeted by Strawberry Fields (Gemma Arterton), a consular employee who demands Bond return to the UK immediately. Bond seduces her and they attend a fundraising party Greene holds that night. At the party, Bond again rescues Camille from Greene. Leaving, Bond and Camille are pulled over by Bolivian police working for Medrano. They had earlier attacked Mathis and put him in the boot of Bond's car to frame Bond. In the ensuing struggle, Mathis and the <b>cops</b> <b>are</b> killed.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{show that}} beta <b>COP</b> <b>is</b> present on endosomes and is {{required}} for the formation of vesicles which mediate transport from early to late endosomes. Both the association of beta COP to endosomal membranes as well as transport vesicle formation depend on the lumenal pH. We find that epsilon COP, but not gamma <b>COP,</b> <b>is</b> also associated to endosomes, and that this association is also lumenal pH dependent. Our data, thus, indicate that a subset of <b>COPs</b> <b>is</b> part of the mechanism regulating endosomal membrane transport, and that membrane association of these <b>COPs</b> <b>is</b> controlled by the acidic properties of early endosomes, presumably via a trans-membrane pH sensor...|$|R
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and {{her mother}} visit her brother Bill and his {{pregnant}} wife Tara around Christmas time. Scully answers the phone, and {{the person on the}} other line, who sounds just like her dead sister Melissa, tells her that someone needs her help. Scully traces the call to a nearby home in San Diego where a group of <b>cops</b> <b>are</b> investigating the suicide of a woman, Roberta Sim. The lead detective, Kresge, tells Scully that it was impossible for Roberta to have dialed, as she died before the telephone call was made. That night after dinner Scully reveals to her mother that due to her abduction and cancer she is unable to bear children. Scully flashes back to when as a child, she hid her pet rabbit from her brother in a lunchbox, only for it to suffocate and die. Scully receives another telephone call from the same person on her cell phone, which was once again made from the Sim home. Roberta's husband, Marshall, is meeting with two dark-suited men inside his house and has no desire to listen to and help Scully figure out what is going on.|$|E

While parked on Cornhill in the evening, he saw a man write [...] "all <b>cops</b> <b>are</b> bastards" [...] on the side of another police van, and left his vehicle to arrest him. The suspect's head struck a van door, triggering a response from the crowd that made Harwood believe it was unsafe to return to his vehicle.

500|$|The National Black Police Association {{opposed the}} boycott of Time-Warner and {{the attacks on}} [...] "Cop Killer," [...] {{identifying}} police brutality {{as the cause of}} much anti-police sentiment, and proposed the creation of independent civilian review boards [...] "to scrutinize the actions of our law enforcement officers" [...] as a way of ending the provocations that caused artists such as Body Count [...] "to respond to actions of police brutality and abuse through their music.

40|$|To {{maintain}} a standing posture during various activities, {{the center of}} pressure (<b>COP)</b> must <b>be</b> controlled in a specific area. This region {{was referred to as}} the movable area of <b>COP,</b> and <b>was</b> measured by shifting the center of gravity along the margin of the supporting area. The region was influenced by the supporting condition and the visual condition. Using a force platform we measured COP of 5 normal adults when stationary and the movable area of COP for 30 seconds under 6 conditions (supporting condition : legs 15 cm apart, closed legs together and one leg; visual condition : eyes open and eyes closed). The 3 -D histogram of the distribution of cumulated densities of <b>COP</b> <b>was</b> prepared and was compared with the movable area of COP. The results showed that under an easy standing condition, the movable area of <b>COP</b> <b>was</b> very large, <b>COP</b> <b>was</b> concentrated in the small area, and the densities of <b>COP</b> <b>were</b> high. As the standing condition became more difficult, the movable area of COP decreased, the scatter of COP widened, and the densities of COP decreased. Under very difficult standing conditions, the movable area of <b>COP</b> <b>was</b> almost as large as the area in which <b>COP</b> <b>was</b> scattered. Since the movable area of COP had a close association with the scatter of <b>COP,</b> it <b>was</b> possible to predict the scatter of COP by analyzing the movable area of COP...|$|R

500|$|The idea of {{the sequel}} was {{conceived}} at one of Marvel's semi-annual editorial retreats. Axel Alonso, editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics, stated that unlike other major comic book storylines which take years of planning, he only had {{three to four months}} to plan [...] "Civil War II". This abbreviated timetable was necessary in order to capitalize on the release of the feature film , which was released in May 2016. According to the official synopsis, a strange new character with the power to accurately predict the outcome of future events comes {{to the attention of the}} world. This power divides the heroes on how best to utilize the information, with Captain Marvel wanting to profile future crimes before they occur, and Iron Man believing that [...] "the punishment cannot come before the crime." [...] The situation reaches a turning point when it is predicted that one of the heroes will be the cause of major destruction, forcing the others to make a difficult decision. Bendis said, [...] "People's personal accountability is the theme of this one... from the way <b>cops</b> <b>are</b> acting on camera, to the way people talk to each other online." [...] The plot for [...] "Civil War II" [...] began to develop in the second volume of The Invincible Iron Man, which is also written by Bendis and drawn by Marquez.|$|E

2500|$|Research {{suggests}} that police practices, such as racial profiling, over-policing in areas populated by minorities and in-group bias {{may result in}} disproportionately high numbers of racial minorities among crime suspects.

[...] Research has found evidence of in-group bias, where [...] "black (white) juveniles who are randomly assigned to black (white) judges are more likely to get incarcerated (as opposed to being placed on probation), and they receive longer sentences."

2500|$|Brief vignettes {{featuring}} McKinney and McCulloch {{as a pair}} of Toronto {{city police}} officers, usually standing beside their squad car, making banal small-talk while rarely doing actual police work.

2500|$|Blue Heelers creator/producer, Hal McElroy, {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} Blue Heelers when he heard that an eighteen-year-old friend was planning to become a police officer. Intrigued, he inquired as to why this young boy, fresh out of school, would {{want to become a}} police officer, as opposed to the many other opportunities he had open to him. McElroy soon discovered that, at the time, a staggering 60% of Australian police officers were under the age of 26. This, coupled with McElroy's desire to create a country cop show, formed the basis of the programme. When this same young officer left the force only a year later due to the shooting death of his colleague, McElroy was even more intrigued to learn about the very fickle, yet rewarding job of policing the community. McElroy continued his quest by asking ex-police officer Michael Winter to write down {{what it was like to}} be a city cop who transferred to a country town. These became the ideas that Blue Heelers was based around. Michael Winter also {{conceived the}} name of the programme by recounting the common names for a country police officer: [...] "tyre-biters"—referring to the fact that country <b>cops</b> <b>are</b> often involved in car chases—and [...] "blue heelers"—referring to their blue uniforms and overall similar appearance and persona to a Blue Heeler dog, a protective and intuitive breed of Australian dog. From the time that McElroy's idea was initially conceived, to the time the programme was ready to air, three years passed.|$|E
