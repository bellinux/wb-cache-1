We introduce a type and effect system to statically check access rights and information flow. We show that typable programs are secure, that is, they do not attempt at making illegal read accesses, nor illegal information leakage. This provides us with a natural restriction on declassification, namely that a program may only declassify information that it {{has the right to}} read...|$|R

5|$|The first {{studies for}} {{irrigation}} in the Plain {{were conducted by}} the United States Geological Survey in the late 19thcentury, and the project was authorized on April23, 1904. The first dam <b>constructed</b> <b>for</b> the project was Minidoka Dam in 1904; its power plant began operating in 1909, producing 7MW of electricity. This capacity was revised to 20MW in 1993. However, Minidoka Dam {{was not the only}} dam <b>constructed</b> <b>for</b> the project. As far upstream as Jackson Lake in Wyoming, the Jackson Lake Dam was built in 1907 to raise the lake level for providing additional water storage for dry years. American Falls Dam, upstream of Minidoka, was completed in 1927 and replaced in 1978. As the dams were constructed above Shoshone Falls, the historical upriver limit of salmon and also a total barrier to boats and ships, no provisions were made for fish passage or navigation. Several other irrigation dams were also built - including Twin Falls Dam and Palisades Dam.|$|E
