In this study, we used matrix population models, which link birth, growth and survival to <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> rate, to examine how and why <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> rates vary within and among 50 terrestrial plant species. <b>Population</b> <b>growth</b> rates were more similar within species than among species; with phylogeny having a minimal influence on among-species variation. Most <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> rates decreased over the observation period and were negatively autocorrelated between years; that is, higher than average <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> rates tended {{to be followed by}} lower than average <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> rates. <b>Population</b> <b>growth</b> rates varied more through time than space; this temporal variation was due mostly to {{variation in}} post-seedling survival and for a subset of species was partly explained by response to environmental factors, such as fire and herbivory.

Using interaction variables in light of the severe degree of multicollinearity among explanatory variables, we find that per capita GDP growth linearly depends on <b>population</b> <b>growth,</b> the old dependency ratio, the mortality rate, and the interactions between <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> and both the young and old dependency ratios, between <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> and whether or not the rate of <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> is less than 1. 2 percent per year, and the interaction term between the young dependency ratio and whether or not the rate of <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> is less than 1. 2 percent per year.
