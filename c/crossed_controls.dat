50|$|In aviation, cross-controlled flight {{refers to}} a state of uncoordinated flight where the aircraft's rudder and ailerons are working in {{opposite}} directions. <b>Crossed</b> <b>controls</b> are most commonly used in slips. Having <b>crossed</b> <b>controls,</b> as in any form of uncoordinated flight, is aerodynamically unsound and if not monitored closely by the pilot can result in a stall or a spin.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the anxiolytic effect of Oxalis corniculata in mice was examined. Methods: The open field test, elevated plus maze test and anti-fighting test {{were used to}} assess the anxiolytic activity of ethanolic extract of Oxalis corniculata. Diazepam 1 mg/kg served as a standard anxiolytic drug, administered intraperitoneally. Results: Ethanolic extract of Oxalis corniculata (100 and 300 mg/kg) produced {{a significant increase in the}} number of squares <b>crossed</b> (<b>controls</b> = 24. 33 依 3. 48), but significantly decreased both the immobility (controls = 47. 17 依 4. 29 sec) and fecal pellets (controls = 13. 50 依 0. 96 fecal pellets) when compared with control mice in the open-field test; they significantly increased the number of entries (controls = 53. 00 依 2. 67 sec) in the open arms, but decreased both the number of entries (controls = 29. 33 依 1. 05 entries) and time spent (controls = 166. 7 依 4. 30 sec) when compared with the control mice in the closed arms of the elevated plus-maze test. Furthermore, ethanol extract of Oxalis corniculata (100 and 300 mg/ kg) decreased the fighting episodes significantly (controls = 9. 50 依 0. 62 fighting episodes) when compared with control mice. In addition these results were found to be consistent with anxiolytic effect produced by diazepam. Conclusions: The results of present study suggest that an ethanolic extract of Oxalis corniculata may possess anxiolytic activity and provide scientific evidence for its traditional claim...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this chapter is to provide rail practitioners with a practical approach for determining safety requirements of low-cost level crossing warning devices (LCLCWDs) on an Australian railway {{by way of a}} case study.

40|$|<b>Cross</b> {{connection}} <b>control</b> and backflow prevention {{are not a}} new concern. All {{states have}} some type of law or regulation for the <b>control</b> of <b>cross</b> connections and/or backflow prevention. The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) held stakeholder meetings in 2003, where the possibility of a national regulation requiring water systems to have a <b>cross</b> connection <b>control</b> program was discussed. A national regulation for <b>cross</b> connection <b>control</b> will impact the 49, 497 Community Water Systems (CWS) and 19, 668 Nontransient and Noncommunity Water Systems (NTNCWS) in the U. S. that serve 10, 000 or fewer persons (USEPA 2003). This report presents a methodology to estimate the national cost for a <b>cross</b> connection <b>control</b> program for these water systems. The accuracy of any cost estimating model is determined by the quality of data available to develop the model. Unfortunately, very little reliable data is available for estimating the cost of cross-connection control programs in small water system. Because the existing underlying data are not strong, only an “order of magnitude ” level estimate can be developed at this time. Project Approach. In this study, the total national water system cost is estimated b...|$|R
40|$|The {{single phase}} fully {{controlled}} converter {{is used to}} convert single phase A. C supply to D. C supply. Such converter finds application in dc motor loads for motoring and electrical braking of the motor. There {{are two types of}} control schemes to control the firing of thyristors, they are Cosine wave <b>crossing</b> <b>control</b> and Ramp comparator control. In this paper, cosine wave <b>crossing</b> <b>control</b> is used for the control circuit. The advantage of this scheme is that the output voltage is proportional to the control voltage ie., the output voltage is independent of the variation of input voltage. The various protections such as over current, short circuit, under voltage protections etc are included. The main objective of this project is to design an efficient, simple, robust and economical control circuit thereby making the fully controlled converter. The fully controlled converter uses four thyristors. It is a two quadrant converter was voltage polarity can reverse, but current direction cannot reverse because of unidirectional nature of thyristors. In this paper, I have presented the control circuit for the thyristors along with the protection circuits to control Dc Motors of rating 220 V, 5. 8 A and 1500 rpm...|$|R
40|$|A level <b>crossing</b> <b>control</b> {{system is}} {{specified}} in CCS, {{motivated by a}} temporal logic specification of the safety requirements.
