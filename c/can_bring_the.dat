25|$|Such a {{transformation}} {{is called a}} diagonalizable matrix since in the eigenbasis, the transformation is represented by a diagonal matrix. Because operations like matrix multiplication, matrix inversion, and determinant calculation are simple on diagonal matrices, computations involving matrices are much simpler if we <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> matrix to a diagonal form.

25|$|In {{response}} to the Zionists' use of Rabbi Chaim Vital (see above), the Satmar Rebbe argued that Vital's remarks refer not to the Three Oaths incumbent on the Jewish people, but to God's oath not to redeem the Jewish people unless they repent out of love.

25|$|Alcohol can {{alleviate}} the drinker’s feelings of stress or anxiety. Alcohol myopia limits those {{under the influence}} of alcohol to see the world through a nearsighted lens; in other words, consumption of alcohol will lead individuals to temporarily forget about previous worries or problems, for these feelings lay outside of the restricted set of immediate cues that the drinker can respond to. By depriving him of the attention capacity necessary to process undesirable thoughts, alcohol myopia <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> drinker a sense of relief.|$|E
25|$|Many real {{dynamical}} {{systems do}} not exactly fit this model. In fact, unmodelled dynamics can seriously degrade the filter performance, {{even when it}} was supposed to work with unknown stochastic signals as inputs. The {{reason for this is that}} the effect of unmodelled dynamics depends on the input, and, therefore, <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> estimation algorithm to instability (it diverges). On the other hand, independent white noise signals will not make the algorithm diverge. The problem of distinguishing between measurement noise and unmodelled dynamics is a difficult one and is treated in control theory under the framework of robust control.|$|E

25|$|The Innate Knowledge {{thesis is}} similar to the Intuition/Deduction thesis in the regard that both theses claim {{knowledge}} is gained a priori. The two theses go their separate ways when describing how that knowledge is gained. As the name, and the rationale, suggests, the Innate Knowledge thesis claims knowledge is simply part of our rational nature. Experiences can trigger a process that allows this knowledge to come into our consciousness, but the experiences don't provide us with the knowledge itself.

500|$|Manitoba has {{an extreme}} {{continental}} climate. Temperatures and precipitation generally decrease from south to north and increase {{from east to}} west. Manitoba {{is far from the}} moderating influences of mountain ranges or large bodies of water. Because of the generally flat landscape, it is exposed to cold Arctic high-pressure air masses from the northwest during January and February. In the summer, air masses sometimes come out of the Southern United States, as warm humid air is drawn northward from the Gulf of Mexico. Temperatures exceed [...] numerous times each summer, and the combination of heat and humidity <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> humidex value to the mid-40s. Carman, Manitoba recorded the second-highest humidex ever in Canada in 2007, with 53.0.

500|$|After the 2002 {{report by}} Joseph Hoff, the {{township}} councilman {{in opposition to}} the Laurence Harbor train station, the 74-year-old politician himself died on November 20, 2003. The proposal for the new train station began to wane for sometime, until 2005, when Aliferi, the designer and constructor of [...] "Bridgepointe" [...] returned to the township board. This time Aliferi proposed the continuation of construction for the two decade-old project, with several community groups either opposing the plan, or raising concerns. The proposal was to include a seven-story hotel, 83 single-family homes, two parking garages and [...] of retail space. The local highway, Laurence Parkway, would also receive improvements to better handle the new development. Concerns were also raised by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, the agency that governs the Garden State Parkway, about the effects on the off-ramp for Exit 120. On February 8, 2006, the Old Bridge Township Council turned over on a 7-0 vote for the new development. Aliferi sued the township, taking the case to the New Jersey Superior Court. A judge sided with Aliferi, citing that the developer <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> proposal back to the council. On February 21, 2007, the proposal was rejected again, partially citing that Aliferi has no interest in building the hotel or the offices.|$|E

500|$|Unique to Ōkami is the Celestial Brush. Players <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> game to a {{pause and}} call up a canvas, where the player can draw onto the screen, either using the left analog stick on the DualShock controller, or {{pointing}} with the Wii Remote or PlayStation Move controller in subsequent remakes. This feature {{is used in}} combat, puzzles and as general gameplay. For example, the player can create strong wind by drawing a loop, cut enemies by drawing a line through them or fix bridges by painting on the broken one, amongst many other abilities. These techniques are learned {{through the course of}} the game by completing constellations to release the Celestial Brush gods (inspired by the Chinese zodiac) from their hiding spots. It is also possible to upgrade or modify certain Brush powers later in the game; for example, the Celestial Brush power [...] "Inferno" [...] can gain a new power called [...] "Fireburst", which has a different drawing pattern, and allows players to create flames without relying on torches or other related items. The player's ink for drawing is limited by the amount available in special ink wells, preventing the player from solely using Brush techniques to defeat enemies; ink is restored in the wells over time when the Brush is not used.|$|E
