5|$|Little Catawissa Creek is {{considered}} by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery between its headwaters and Reservoir Road. Between Reservoir Road and {{the mouth of the}} creek, it {{is considered}} to be a Coldwater Fishery. The upper reaches of the creek, between its headwaters and a point slightly downstream of where it enters Schuylkill County are considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class A Wild Trout Waters and the rest of the creek's length is considered to be Approved Trout Waters. The upper reaches of the creek were Class A Wild Trout Waters in 1976 before becoming <b>Class</b> <b>D</b> Wild Trout Waters in 1984. This change was due to acid mine drainage and sediment buildup. However, the creek rebounded to Class A Wild Trout Waters by 1997. The creek is considered to be <b>Class</b> <b>D</b> Wild Trout Waters between T431 and T435. The tributary Trexler Run is also considered to be Class A Wild Trout Waters throughout its length.|$|E

5|$|Although {{ytterbium}} {{is fairly}} stable chemically, it {{is stored in}} airtight containers and in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen-filled dry box {{to protect it from}} air and moisture. All compounds of ytterbium are treated as highly toxic, although studies appear to indicate that the danger is minimal. However, ytterbium compounds cause irritation to human skin and eyes, and some might be teratogenic. Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust, and the resulting fumes are hazardous. Ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water, and only dry chemical <b>class</b> <b>D</b> fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} hierarchical {{properties and}} log-space reductions of languages recognized by log-space probabilistic Turing machines, Arthur-Merlin games and Games against Nature with log-space probabilistic verifiers. For each log-space complexity class, we decompose {{it into a}} hierarchy based on corresponding multihead two-way finite automata and we (eventually) prove {{the separation of the}} hierarchy levels (even over one letter alphabet); furthermore, we show log-space reductions of each log-space complexity class to low levels of its corresponding hierarchy. We find probabilistic (and "probabilistic+nondeterministic") variants of Savitch's maze threading problem which are log-space complete for PL (and respectively P) and can be recognized by two-head one-way and one-way one-counter finite automata with probabilistic (probabilistic and nondeterministic) states.

Briefly considering a career in baseball, he finally decided to study law. He entered Harvard Law School that same year, paying his way by coaching high school sports in Wellesley, Massachusetts. His former teammate Charlie Moran, then coaching the Centre College Praying Colonels football team in Danville, Kentucky, asked him to scout the national powerhouse Harvard Crimson, an upcoming opponent for Centre.

5|$|Nescopeck Creek is home {{to brown}} trout and brook trout near its source, but does not have much life further {{downstream}} because coal mine waste in Little Nescopeck Creek pollutes the lower reaches of Nesocpeck Creek. In 1999, a study discovered 20 species of fish living in the Nescopeck Creek watershed. Of these, 15 had been observed before in the watershed, and five had not. Nesopeck Creek and its various tributaries are rated Class A to <b>Class</b> <b>D</b> for wild trout. There {{are a number of}} riparian buffers on Nescopeck Creek, of which 80percent consist of forest. Along parts of Nescopeck Creek, there are a large number of shrub-like oak trees.

5|$|This {{reaction}} is exothermic and releases enough heat to ignite the resulting hydrogen {{in the presence}} of oxygen, possibly explosively splashing onlookers with potassium hydroxide, which is a strong alkali that destroys living tissue and causes skin burns. Finely grated potassium ignites in air at room temperature. The bulk metal ignites in air if heated. Because its density is 0.89 g/cm3, burning potassium floats in water that exposes it to atmospheric oxygen. Many common fire extinguishing agents, including water, either are ineffective or make a potassium fire worse. Nitrogen, argon, sodium chloride (table salt), sodium carbonate (soda ash), and silicon dioxide (sand) are effective if they are dry. Some <b>Class</b> <b>D</b> dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are also effective. These agents deprive the fire of oxygen and cool the potassium metal.|$|E

5|$|When {{placed over}} a flame, lithium {{compounds}} give off a striking crimson color, {{but when it}} burns strongly the flame becomes a brilliant silver. Lithium will ignite and burn in oxygen when exposed to water or water vapors. Lithium is flammable, and it is potentially explosive when exposed to air and especially to water, though less so than the other alkali metals. The lithium-water reaction at normal temperatures is brisk but nonviolent because the hydrogen produced does not ignite on its own. As with all alkali metals, lithium fires are difficult to extinguish, requiring dry powder fire extinguishers (<b>Class</b> <b>D</b> type). Lithium {{is one of the}} few metals that react with nitrogen under normal conditions.|$|E
