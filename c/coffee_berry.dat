25|$|The 2-mm-long coffee borer beetle (Hypothenemus hampei) is {{the most}} {{damaging}} insect pest to the world's coffee industry, destroying up to 50 {{percent or more of}} the coffee berries on plantations in most coffee-producing countries. The adult female beetle nibbles a single tiny hole in a <b>coffee</b> <b>berry</b> and lays 35 to 50 eggs. Inside, the offspring grow, mate, and then emerge from the commercially ruined berry to disperse, repeating the cycle. Pesticides are mostly ineffective because the beetle juveniles are protected inside the berry nurseries, but they are vulnerable to predation by birds when they emerge. When groves of trees are nearby, the American yellow warbler, rufous-capped warbler, and other insectivorous birds have been shown to reduce by 50 percent the number of <b>coffee</b> <b>berry</b> borers in Costa Rica coffee plantations.|$|E

25|$|<b>Coffee</b> <b>berries</b> {{and their}} seeds undergo several {{processes}} {{before they become}} the familiar roasted <b>coffee.</b> <b>Berries</b> have been traditionally selectively picked by hand; a labor-intensive method, it involves the selection of only the berries {{at the peak of}} ripeness. More commonly, crops are strip picked, where all berries are harvested simultaneously regardless of ripeness by person or machine. After picking, green coffee is processed by one of two methods—the dry process method, simpler and less labor-intensive as the berries can be strip picked, and the wet process method, which incorporates fermentation into the process and yields a mild coffee.|$|R

2500|$|The coffee borer beetle or <b>coffee</b> <b>berry</b> borer (Hypothenemus hampei) {{is a small}} beetle {{native to}} Africa.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, coffee {{farmers in the}} state of São Paulo were having a hard time in {{controlling}} the coffee borer beetle (Hypothenemus hampei), a bug that destroys <b>coffee</b> <b>berries</b> by perforating them (perforated <b>coffee</b> <b>berries</b> have no value in the commodities market). Gabriel Ribeiro dos Santos, the Secretary of Agriculture of the state of São Paulo at that time, has organised a commission of scientists in May 1924 to identify the coffee borer beetle and prevent further losses in the coffee fields. A report was delivered to the Secretary of Agriculture, and the actual research started in the same year with Arthur Neiva, Adalberto Queiros Teles and Edmundo Navarro, who worked in two chemistry and entomology laboratories.|$|R

Mix the beverage in a cold cup, partake with moderation, and keep a wet rag around your head to guard against over-excitement.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{aimed to}} verify if the growth pattern of <b>coffee</b> <b>berries,</b> {{considering}} fresh mass accumulation over time, is double sigmoid and {{to select the}} most suitable nonlinear model to describe such behavior. Data used consisted of fourteen longitudinal observations of average fresh mass of <b>coffee</b> <b>berries</b> obtained in an experiment with the cultivar Obatã IAC 1669 - 20. The fits provided by the Logistic and Gompertz models were compared in their single and double versions. Parameters were estimated using the least squares method using the Gauss-Newton algorithm implemented in the nls function of the R software. It can be concluded that the growth pattern of the coffee fruit, in fresh mass accumulation, is double sigmoid. The double Gompertz and double Logistic models were adequate to describe such a growth curve, with a superiority of the double Logistic model...|$|R

"Sheikh Abdool Kader Ansari Jezeri, {{a learned}} Mahomedan author, in his {{treatise}} {{on the use}} of coffee, quotes the following from the writings of Fakr ood Deen Mekki:--'It is said that the first who introduced coffee was the illustrious saint Aboo Abdallah Mahomed Dhabhani ibn Said; but we have learned by the testimony of many persons that the use of coffee in Yemen, its origin, and first introduction into that country are due to the learned All Shadeli ibn Omar, one of the disciples of the learned doctor Nasr ood Deen, who is {{regarded as one of the}} chiefs among the order Shadeli, and whose worth attests the high degree of spirituality to which they had attained. Previous to that time they made coffee of the vegetable substance called Cafta, which is the same as the leaf known under the name of Kat, and not of Boon (the <b>coffee</b> <b>berry)</b> nor any preparation of Boon. The use of this beverage extended in course of time as far as Aden, but in the days of Mahomed Dhabhani the vegetable substance from which it was prepared disappeared from Aden. Then it was that the Sheik advised those who had become his disciples to try the drink made from the Boon, which was found to produce the same effect as the Kat, inducing sleeplessness, and that it was attended with less expense and trouble. The use of coffee has been kept up from that time to the present.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Between the {{possibility}} of being hanged in all innocence, and the certainty of a public and merited disgrace, no gentleman of spirit could long hesitate. After three gulps of that hot, snuffy, and muddy beverage, that passes on the streets of London for a decoction of the <b>coffee</b> <b>berry,</b> Gideon's mind was made up. He would do without the police. He must face {{the other side of the}} dilemma, and be Robert Skill in earnest. What would Robert Skill have done? How does a gentleman dispose of a dead body, honestly come by? He remembered the inimitable story of the hunchback; reviewed its course, and dismissed it for a worthless guide. It was impossible to prop a corpse on the corner of Tottenham Court Road without arousing fatal curiosity in the bosoms of the passers-by; as for lowering it down a London chimney, the physical obstacles were insurmountable. To get it on board a train and drop it out, or on the top of an omnibus and drop it off, were equally out of the question. To get it on a yacht and drop it overboard, was more conceivable; but for a man of moderate means it seemed extravagant. The hire of the yacht was in itself a consideration; the subsequent support of the whole crew (which seemed a necessary consequence) was simply not to be thought of. His uncle and the houseboat here occurred in very luminous colours to his mind. A musical composer (say, of the name of Jimson) might very well suffer, like Hogarth's musician before him, from the disturbances of London. He might very well be pressed for time to finish an opera--say the comic opera Orange Pekoe--Orange Pekoe, music by Jimson--"this young maëstro, one of the most promising of our recent English school"--vigorous entrance of the drums, etc.--the whole character of Jimson and his music arose in bulk before the mind of Gideon. What more likely than Jimson's arrival with a grand piano (say, at Padwick), and his residence in a houseboat alone with the unfinished score of Orange Pekoe? His subsequent disappearance, leaving nothing behind but an empty piano case, it might be more difficult to account for. And yet even that was susceptible of explanation. For, suppose Jimson had gone mad over a fugal passage, and had thereupon destroyed the accomplice of his infamy, and plunged into the welcome river? What end, on the whole, more probable for a modern musician? ...|$|E
