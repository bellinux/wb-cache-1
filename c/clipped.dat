5|$|Almost every silver siliqua in the hoard has had {{its edge}} <b>clipped</b> to some degree. This is typical of Roman silver coin finds of this period in Britain, {{although}} <b>clipped</b> coins are very unusual {{through the rest of}} the Roman Empire. The clipping process invariably leaves the imperial portrait on the front of the coin intact, but often damages the mint mark, inscription, and the image on the obverse.|$|E

50|$|<b>Clipping</b> {{is defined}} as the {{interaction}} of subject and <b>clip</b> polygons. While <b>clipping</b> usually involves finding the intersections (regions of overlap) of subject and <b>clip</b> polygons, <b>clipping</b> algorithms can also be applied with other boolean <b>clipping</b> operations: difference, where the <b>clipping</b> polygons remove overlapping regions from the subject; union, where <b>clipping</b> returns the regions covered by either subject or <b>clip</b> polygons, and; xor, where <b>clipping</b> returns the regions covered by either subject or <b>clip</b> polygons except where they are covered by both subject and <b>clip</b> polygons.|$|R
50|$|A money <b>clip</b> wallet is a <b>clip</b> {{designed}} specifically to hold both credit cards and cash. The conventional money <b>clip</b> wallets are a credit card holder with either a swivel magnetic <b>clip</b> attached to the back side or a solid <b>clip</b> that is bent 6-fold; bent that way the conventional <b>clip</b> will feature three compartments instead of one. Money <b>clip</b> wallets are sometimes known as hybrid money <b>clips.</b>|$|R

5|$|Ellen Biddle Shipman {{designed}} the Italian Garden in May 1931. It features {{two rows of}} <b>clipped</b> evergreens between two long, rectangular reflecting pools. It has a focal point {{at the end of}} the garden in the form of a marble fountain surrounded by an arched gloriette. There are also a number of statues, ornaments, tubs of small trees, and flowers.|$|E
5|$|Giant Schnauzers require regular grooming. Their beard {{can collect}} drool and food particles, making {{frequent}} cleanings essential. If being shown, their coat {{needs to be}} stripped every two to four weeks. If they are simply a companion animal, the coat can be <b>clipped</b> instead. Some Giant Schnauzers have an allergy to shampoo.|$|E
50|$|Tubal clipThe tubal <b>clip</b> (Filshie <b>clip</b> or Hulka <b>clip)</b> {{technique}} {{involves the}} application of a permanent <b>clip</b> onto the fallopian tube. Once applied and fastened, the <b>clip</b> disallows movement of eggs from the ovary to the uterus.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a low {{complexity}} <b>clipping</b> method {{to reduce the}} peak power of OFDM signals. The proposed <b>clipping</b> method exploits the conventional square <b>clipping,</b> which <b>clips</b> signal according to the amplitude in I/Q-channels separately, to avoid obtaining a real amplitude of each sample which costs relatively high computational complexities. By combining the square <b>clipping</b> and phase rotations of signals, the proposed octagon <b>clipping</b> achieves close <b>clipping</b> performances to the amplitude based normal <b>clipping</b> {{with a small amount}} of computations. The proposed method requires 4 comparison operations, one addition, and one subtraction to <b>clip</b> a sample of signal. I...|$|R

5|$|King was {{sponsored}} by the Daily Express and Sunday Express newspapers. One of the shortcomings of the boat was that it had neither guard rails or shrouds to hold on to. King solved this problem with a steel wire that stretched from bow to stern, to which he <b>clipped</b> a harness. His method was then copied by fellow racers Loïck Fougeron and Bernard Moitessier.|$|E

By default <b>clips</b> move around each other “magnetically” filling in any gaps and avoiding <b>Clip</b> Collisions by automatically bumping <b>clips</b> {{out of the way}} vertically.

5000|$|A {{stripper}} <b>clip</b> (also {{sometimes referred}} to as a charger <b>clip)</b> is used only for loading the magazine and is not necessary for the firearm to function, unlike an en bloc <b>clip,</b> which requires the <b>clip</b> with its ammunition to be inserted into the weapon to function. Generally, a weapon that can use a stripper <b>clip</b> for loading can also be loaded one round at a time, while a weapon designed for an en bloc <b>clip</b> cannot be used without the <b>clip.</b> It is called a 'stripper' <b>clip</b> because, after the bolt is opened and the stripper <b>clip</b> is placed in position (generally by placing it in a slot on either the receiver or bolt), the user presses on the cartridges from above, sliding them down and off the <b>clip,</b> thereby 'stripping' them off the stripper <b>clip</b> and into the magazine. After the magazine is loaded, the stripper <b>clip</b> is removed and set aside for reloading, or simply discarded during combat. [...] Depending on the firearm, magazine, and cartridge, stripper <b>clips</b> {{come in a variety of}} shapes, some quite complex, though most are either straight or crescent-shaped pieces of stamped metal—usually brass, steel (often blued or parkerized), or plastic.|$|R
5|$|The gardens were {{constructed}} {{in a series}} of 'rooms', which are separated from each other by high, neatly <b>clipped</b> box and yew hedges. The gardens were influenced by the Arts and Crafts style popular at the time. The Jenners had a garden staff of four.|$|E
5|$|The {{huge number}} of <b>clipped</b> coins in the Hoxne Hoard has made it {{possible}} for archaeologists to observe the process of coin-clipping in detail. The coins were evidently cut face-up to avoid damaging the portrait. The average level of clipping is roughly the same for coins dating from 350 onwards.|$|E
5|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 178, with Earnhardt leading Johnson and Vickers. That lap, Burton (in fifth) had a flat left {{rear tire}} and lost a lap. The field then formed a single line, with most remaining in that formation {{for the rest}} of the race. On the final lap, Johnson and Vickers left turn two with Johnson moving out of line to pass Earnhardt. When Vickers tried to move out with Johnson to provide drafting assistance, he <b>clipped</b> Johnson's right rear quarter panel. Johnson <b>clipped</b> Earnhardt, sending both drivers into the infield. The yellow flag went out and the field was frozen in place, with the order of finish determined by where the drivers were when the caution began. This gave Vickers the victory (the first of his career), although he was booed by the crowd.|$|E
5000|$|Soft <b>clipping</b> {{is a very}} {{important}} aspect of tube sound especially for guitar amplifiers. A hi-fi amplifier should not normally ever be driven into <b>clipping.</b> The harmonics added to the signal are of lower energy with soft <b>clipping</b> than hard <b>clipping.</b> However, soft <b>clipping</b> is not exclusive to tubes. It can be simulated in transistor circuits (below the point that real hard <b>clipping</b> would occur). (See [...] "Intentional distortion" [...] section).|$|R

5|$|As dusk {{began to}} fall on the drying track, the No. 8 Peugeot {{suffered}} from rear wheel hub failures which required two lengthy visits to the garage. This allowed the No. 1 Audi to take over second place. Jacques Villeneuve's No. 7 Peugeot also lost time, which dropped it to two laps behind the No. 2 Audi. The No. 1 Audi had its own brief moment when the No. 63 Corvette <b>clipped</b> the Audi's rear end. The Corvette was forced to take evasive action through the Dunlop Chicane's gravel trap, and the Audi required replacement rear bodywork on its next pit stop.|$|E

One of Miller's sixes travelled over 170m {{in the air to}} Block Q next to the pavilion. He then aimed a lofted shot over long on from the bowling of Hollies, directly at the pavilion. It was still rising when it narrowly went over the press box and <b>clipped</b> the top of the roof. Test spinner James Langridge was brought on and Miller deposited two drives over the fence in his first over.|$|E
5|$|Matheos {{suggested}} {{using an}} altered {{version of the}} United States passport for the album's cover art. The differences are that the arrows are double-headed, the olive branch is wilted, and the eagle's wings have been <b>clipped.</b> Matheos, Moore and Portnoy decided against sending out promotional copies of the album before its release date {{in order to prevent}} an early Internet leak of it. The album was released in Europe on February 17, 2003.|$|E
