5000|$|The {{church at}} Martin dates from Norman times {{although}} much of its fabric is fourteenth century. The village green still has the village pump, consisting of an iron frame with a <b>cranked</b> <b>spindle</b> through it. The base of the 15th century village cross {{can also be seen}} here.|$|R
50|$|The Octalink {{system uses}} a spindle with eight splines. The splines provide a contact area between <b>crank</b> and <b>spindle</b> for an interface. Octalink {{exists in the}} {{marketplace}} in two variants, Octalink v1 and Octalink v2. The {{difference between the two}} can be seen by the depth of mounting grooves on the bottom bracket spindle. V1 spline grooves are 5 mm long, while V2 are 9mm long. 105, Ultegra 6500 and Dura Ace 7700 cranksets mate to version one bottom brackets, while later mountain bike designs use the deeper-grooved version two. The system is proprietary and protected by Shimano patents and license fees.|$|R
50|$|Because all {{the load}} is on one very small {{area of the}} cotter pin and the crank land the cotter pin deforms plastically under normal use and so must be {{replaced}} regularly. If this is not done the <b>crank</b> and the <b>spindle</b> wear and must be replaced. There is warning because of a characteristic creak sound that aging pins cause the cranks to make.|$|R
50|$|Most {{dividing}} heads {{operate at}} a 40:1 ratio; that is 40 turns {{of the hand}} crank generates 1 revolution of the spindle or workpiece. In other words, 1 turn of the hand <b>crank</b> rotates the <b>spindle</b> by 9 degrees. Because the operator of the machine may want to rotate the part to an arbitrary angle indexing plates are used to ensure the part is accurately positioned.|$|R
