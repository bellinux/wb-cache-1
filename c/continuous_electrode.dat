The relatively high charge capacity of the patterned electrode is mainly related to an electrochemical reaction between Li and Cu oxide layers partially exposed on the surface. It had been already reported that the reaction occurred at a voltage range of 1.7 V to 1.0 V and then formed LixCuO [13]. In addition to this, another reason is the solid electrolyte interphase formation that is sensitive to the surface morphology of the electrode because the patterned electrode has a wider surface area than the <b>continuous</b> <b>electrode</b> [6]. These reaction products lead to the capacity loss at the first cycle, and thus a low coulombic efficiency ((discharge capacity/charge capacity) × 100 (%)) of 60 % was obtained at the first cycle as shown in Figure 4 b.

During a typical process the electrodes are consumed at a rate of about 0. 5 m/day and are normally charged by adding large (typically 1 m high cylinders of diameter up to 1 m) blocks of raw material to the top of the electrode.

Generating usable {{electrical energy}} during their mission has the important practical value of providing an additional energy source to run small electronic components. Electrical energy can be harvested from aeroelastic vibrations of lifting surfaces of UAVs and MAVs as {{they tend to}} have relatively flexible wings compared to their larger counterparts. In this work, an electromechanically coupled finite element model is combined with an unsteady aerodynamic model to develop a piezoaeroelastic model for airflow excitation of cantilevered plates representing wing-like structures. The electrical power output and the displacement of the wing tip are investigated for several airflow speeds and two different <b>electrode</b> configurations (<b>continuous</b> and segmented). Cancelation of electrical output occurs for typical coupled bending-torsion aeroelastic modes of a cantilevered generator wing when <b>continuous</b> <b>electrodes</b> are used.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} design of a perfect point load {{actuator}} based on flat triangular piezoelectric patches. Applying a difference of electric potential between the electrodes of a triangular patch leads to point loads at the tips and distributed moments along the edges of the electrodes. The previously derived analytical expressions of these forces show that they depend on two factors: the width over height (b/l) ratio of the triangle, and the ratio of the in-plane piezoelectric properties (e 31 /e 32) of the active layer of the piezoelectric patch. In this paper, it is shown that by a proper choice of b/l and of the piezoelectric properties, the moments can be cancelled, so that if one side of the triangle is clamped, a perfect point load actuation can be achieved. This requires e 31 /e 32 to be negative, which imposes the use of interdigitated <b>electrodes</b> instead of <b>continuous</b> ones. The design of two transducers with interdigitated electrodes for perfect point load actuation on a clamped plate is verified with finite element calculations. The first design is based on a full piezoelectric ceramic patch and shows superior actuation performance than the second design based on a piezocomposite patch with a volume fraction of fibres of 86 %. The results show that both designs lead to perfect point load actuation while the use of an isotropic PZT patch with <b>continuous</b> <b>electrodes</b> gives significantly different results.

First, energy requirements for direct detonation initiation of various fuel-oxygen and fuel-air mixtures are deduced from available experimental data and theoretical models. Second, the pumping power requirements for effective chamber scavenging are examined through {{the introduction of}} a scavenging ratio parameter and a scavenging efficiency parameter. A series of laboratory experiments were carried out to investigate the basic engineering performance characteristics of a pulse detonation-driven MHD electric power generator. In these experiments, stoichiometric oxy-acetylene mixtures seeded with a cesium hydroxide/methanol spray were detonated at atmospheric pressure in a 1 -m-long tube having an i. d. of 2. 54 cm. Experiments with a plasma diagnostic channel attached {{to the end of the}} tube confirmed the attainment of detonation conditions (p 2 /p 1 approximately 34 and D approximately 2, 400 m/sec) and enabled the direct measurement of current density and electrical conductivity (approximately = 6 S/m) behind the detonation wave front, In a second set of experiments, a 30 -cm-long <b>continuous</b> <b>electrode</b> Faraday channel, having a height of 2. 54 cm and a width of 2 cm, was attached to the end of the tube using an area transition duct.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that a {{conventional}} lead acid cell that is exposed to a partial state of charge capacity cycling (PSoCCC) would experience a build-up of irreversible PbSO 4 on the negative electrode. This results into a damaged negative electrode due to excessive PbSO 4 formation by the typical visual “Venetian Blinds” effect of the active material. This displays the loss of adhesion of the active material with the electrode’s grids thereby making large sections of the material ineffective and reducing the cells useful capacity during high current applications. The addition of certain graphites to the negative paste mix had proven to be successful to reduce this effect. In {{the first part of the}} study, the physical and chemical properties of the various additives that are added to the negative electrode paste mix were comparatively studied. This was done to investigate any significant differences between various suppliers that could possibly influence the electrochemical characteristics of the Pb-acid battery performance. This comparative study was done by using the following analytical techniques; BET surface area, laser diffraction particle size, PXRD, TGA-MS and SEM. The study showed that there were no significant differences between the additives supplied from different suppliers except for some anomalies in the usefulness of techniques such as N 2 adsorption to study the BET surface area of BaSO 4. In order to reduce the sulphation effect from occurring within the Pb-acid battery a number of adjustments are made to the electrode active material. For example, Pb-acid battery manufacturers make use of an inert polymer based material, known as Polymat, to cover the electrode surfaces as part of their <b>continuous</b> <b>electrode</b> pasting process. It is made from a non woven polyester fiber that is applied to the pasted electrodes during the continuous pasting process. In this study the Polymat pasted electrodes has demonstrated a better physical adhesion of the active material to the grid support thereby maintaining the active material’s physical integrity. This however did not reduce the sulphation effect due to the high rate partial state of capacity cycling (HRPSoCCC) test but reduced the physical damage due to the irreversible active material blistering effect. The study investigated what effect the Polymat on the electrodes has on the III battery’s Cold Cranking Ability (CCA) at - 18 degree C, the HRPSoCCC cycling and its active material utilization. The study showed that there was little or no differences in the CCA and HRPSoCCC capabilities of cells made with the Polymat when compared to cells without the Polymat, with significant improvement in active material’s adhesion and integrity to the grid wire. This was confirmed by PXRD and SEM analysis. Negative electrodes were made with four types of graphites (natural, flake, expanded and nano fibre) added to the negative paste mixture in order to reduce the effect of sulphation. The study looked at using statistical design of experiment (DoE) principles to investigate the variables (additives) such as different graphites, BaSO 4 and Vanisperse to the negative electrode paste mixture where upon measuring the responses (electrochemical tests) a set of controlled experiments were done to study the extent of the variables interaction, dependency and independency on the cells electrochemical properties. This was especially in relation to the improvement of the battery’s ability to work under HRPSoCCC. The statistical analysis showed that there was a notable significant influence of the amounts of vanisperse, BaSO 4 and their respective interactions on a number of electrochemical responses, such as the Peukert constant (n), CCA discharge time, material utilization at different discharge rates and the ability to capacity cycle under the simulated HRPSoCCC testing. The study did not suggest an optimized concentration of the additives, but did give an indication that there was a statistical significant trend in certain electrochemical responses with an interaction between the amounts of the additives BaSO 4 and Vanisperse. The study also showed that the addition of a small amount of Nano carbon can significantly change the observed crystal morphology of the negative active material and that an improvement in the number of capacity cycles can be achieved during the HRPSoCCC test when compared to the other types of graphite additive...|$|E

Trapped ions can be extracted using either single isolated clearing <b>electrodes</b> or <b>continuous</b> clearing <b>electrodes.</b> In addition resonant transverse shaking of trapped ions and damping of coherent ion-beam oscillations {{can be used in}} order to reduce the adverse effects of trapped ions. In the region of dipole magnets the problem of trapped ions can be mitigated by upgrading the UHV vacuum, i. e. by sputtering thin-film NEG coatings onto the surfaces of the vacuum chamber and by using heat jackets along the beam tubes. The highest clearing efficiencies in dipole magnets can be achieved by extracting the trapped ions in the vertical direction along the magnetic field lines.

The electromechanical coupling factor of such crystals for all main vibration modes such as the thickness extension and transverse extension modes is more than 0. 9. Operation of ultrasonic transducers with such piezoelectric elements in transmitting and receiving modes is rather different. Therefore, for transmission and reception of ultrasonic signals, separate piezoelectric elements with different dimensions must be used. The objective {{of this research was}} development of novel air-coupled ultrasonic receivers with PMN- 32 %PT strip-like piezoelectric elements vibrating in a transverse-extension mode with electromechanically controlled operation and suitable for applications in ultrasonic arrays. Performance of piezoelectric receivers made of the PMN- 32 %PT strip-like elements vibrating in this mode may be efficiently controlled by selecting geometry of the electrodes covering side surfaces of the piezoelectric element. It is equivalent to introduction of electromechanical damping which does not require any additional backing element. For this purpose; we have proposed the <b>continuous</b> <b>electrodes</b> to divide into two pairs of electrodes. The one pair is used to pick up the electric signal; another one is exploited for electromechanical damping.

40|$|Constant-current, active-matrix organic {{light-emitting}} displays (AM-OLEDs) {{with the}} advanced {{hydrogenated amorphous silicon}} thin film transistor (a-Si:H TFT) pixel electrode circuits have been designed in our laboratory for medical applications. An extensive pixel electrode circuit simulation and analysis indicate that a <b>continuous</b> pixel <b>electrode</b> excitation can be achieved with these circuits, and a pixel electrode driving output current level up to 1. 4 pA can be reached with an a-Si:H TFT technology. Small feed-through voltage (few tenth of mV) {{that can be achieved}} with this circuit will enhance the display gray level controllability needed for medical imaging. Each pixel electrode has a threshold voltage compensation circuit to adjust the pixel electrode driving current level for threshold voltage shifts of both the organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and the current driving a-Si:H TFT. For a 16 -inch VGA full-color AM-OLED with a pixel electrode size of- 6 Ox 1 15 jim 2, the output current level is equivalent to a pixel current density of 20 mA/cm 2. Assuming the OLEDs with an external quantum efficiency of 1 %, the AM-OLED brightness of- 88, 96 O, and- 160 cd/m 2 for red (650 nm), green (540 nm), and blue (480 nm) light emission, respectively, can be achieved with this type of pixel electrode circuits...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCoherence of {{the time}} {{structure}} of growing organisms depends on a metronome-like orchestration. In a continuously perfused culture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae the redox state of the cell shows a temperature-compensated oscillation manifest in respiratory cycles, {{which are measured by}} <b>continuous</b> and non-invasive <b>electrodes</b> of probes such as dissolved oxygen and probes such as fluorometric NAD(P) H. Although the entire transcriptome exhibits low-amplitude oscillatory behaviour, transcripts involved {{in the vast majority of}} metabolism, stress response, cellular structure, protein turnover, mRNA turnover, and DNA synthesis are amongst the top oscillators and their orchestration occurs by an intricate network of transcriptional regulators. Therefore cellular auto-dynamism is a function of a large ensemble of excitable intracellular components of that self-organized temporally and spatially that encompasses mitochondrial, nuclear, transcriptional and metabolic dynamics, coupled by cellular redox state...|$|R
40|$|The carbon paste {{electrode}} containing 17 % (w/w) of dispersed bismuth powder, {{despite its}} well-known performance in electroanalytical stripping methods, was also evaluated {{as a potential}} pH sensor. Potentiometric response to pH of solutions was ascertained under batch and flow conditions and {{compared to that of}} classical glass <b>electrode.</b> <b>Continuous</b> flow or flow injection modes of analysis together with buffers of different pH were employed to study the behavior of modified carbon paste electrode in thin layer cell. Proposed pH sensor exhibited linear, sub-Nernstian response of - 41. 2 mV per pH unit within the working range of pH 2 – 10 in mode of flow injection analysis. The longest response time registered to sudden change in hydrogen ion activity was 40 s. The sensor works de facto sequentially in two modes of operation, which is rather interesting feature described for an electrochemical sensor...|$|R
50|$|A digital {{microfluidic}} (DMF) device set-up {{depends on}} the substrates used, the electrodes, the configuration of those electrodes, {{the use of a}} dielectric material, the thickness of that dielectric material, the hydrophobic layers, and the applied voltage.A common substrate used is this type of system is glass. Depending if the system is open or closed, there would be either one or two layers of glass. The bottom layer of the device contains a patterned array of individually controllable electrodes. When looking at a closed system, there is usually a <b>continuous</b> ground <b>electrode</b> found through the top layer made usually of indium tin oxide (ITO). The dielectric layer is found around the electrodes in the bottom layer of the device and is important for building up charges and electrical field gradients on the device. A hydrophobic layer is applied to the top layer of the system to decrease the surface energy where the droplet will actually we be in contact with. The applied voltage activates the electrodes and allows changes in the wettability of droplet on the device’s surface. In order to move a droplet, a control voltage is applied to an electrode adjacent to the droplet, and at the same time, the electrode just under the droplet is deactivated. By varying the electric potential along a linear array of electrodes, electrowetting can be used to move droplets along this line of electrodes.|$|R
40|$|The {{oxidation}} of phenol {{is compared}} for two different boron doped diamond (BDD) electrodes; a niobium supported BDD planar electrode and a BDD coated Ti mesh. Raman spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry {{were used to}} compare the two <b>electrodes.</b> <b>Continuous</b> oxidation of phenol utilized a flow cell configuration that circulated a fixed volume of solution, scaled to the electrode area, with an initial concentration of 10 mM phenol in 0. 1 M H 2 SO 4. The conversion of phenol to CO 2 was monitored by scheduled collection of aliquots and subsequent total organic carbon (TOC) analysis. The two electrodes were found to have similar conversion rates, with the total carbon decreasing from ~ 1 % to < 0. 1 %. Treatment of a more concentrated solution, 87 mM phenol in 0. 1 M H 2 SO 4, was examined for the planar electrode and resulted in greater efficiency, which was attributed to greater localization between reactants and hydroxyl radicals in the kinetic limited regime...|$|R
40|$|<b>Continuous</b> self-baking <b>electrodes,</b> i. e. Söderberg electrodes, are {{commonly}} {{employed in the}} industrial smelting of ores in submerged arc furnaces. These electrodes are formed from electrode paste that is baked during operation into solid carbonaceous and ultimately graphite electrodes. Coal tar pitch (CTP) {{is used as a}} binder in the electrode paste. In order to ensure the production of quality electrode paste, CTP is analysed for softening point (SP), coking value (CV), as well as toluene- (TI) and quinoline insoluble (QI) contents, together with proximate analysis for the determination of fixed carbon, volatile, ash and moisture contents. Ultimate analyses for the determination of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen contents are also performed. However, the TI and QI content analyses are time consuming and harmful solvents are used. In this paper it was proven that multi-linear regression (MLR) analysis can be used to derive equations to calculate TI and QI fromother parameters, i. e. SP, CV, as well as proximate and ultimate analyses. Root mean square error differences between MLR calculated TI and QI contents for 12 CTP samples sourced from suppliers throughout the world were found to be approximately 0. 36 and 0. 32, respectively. Although it is not foreseen that calculation of these two parameters will replace experimental determinations, the MLR equations determined in this study can be used by CTP producers and consumers as proxies for TI and QI. This will reduce the use of harmful solvents and the frequency required to conduct time consuming experimental determinations for TI and QI[URL]...|$|R
