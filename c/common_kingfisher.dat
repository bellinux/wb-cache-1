25|$|The <b>common</b> <b>kingfisher</b> {{is widely}} {{distributed}} over Europe, Asia, and North Africa, mainly south of 60°N. It {{is a common}} breeding species over much of its vast Eurasian range, but in North Africa it is mainly a winter visitor, although it is a scarce breeding resident in coastal Morocco and Tunisia. In temperate regions, this kingfisher inhabits clear, slow-flowing streams and rivers, and lakes with well-vegetated banks. It frequents scrubs and bushes with overhanging branches close to shallow open water in which it hunts. In winter it is more coastal, often feeding in estuaries or harbours and along rocky seashores. Tropical populations are found by slow-flowing rivers, in mangrove creeks and in swamps.|$|E

500|$|The {{canal and}} its environs are {{important}} for wildlife conservation. There are several Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), which exhibit great biodiversity. Key sites that are home to several rare species include the Aldermaston Gravel Pits, Woolhampton, Thatcham Reed Beds, and Freeman's Marsh, Hungerford. There are also many non-statutory nature reserves along the canal. More than 100different species of bird have been recorded in surveys over {{the length of the}} canal, of which 38 could be classified as specialist waterway birds, including grey heron (Ardea cinerea), reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus) and <b>common</b> <b>kingfisher</b> (Alcedo atthis). [...] Fourteenspecies have been confirmed as breeding including sand martins (Riparia riparia), which nest in drain-pipes in the brick walls of the canal in the centre of Reading. Wilton Water by Crofton Locks and the Kennet Valley gravel pits provide habitats for breeding and wintering waterfowl. Several species of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) and other invertebrates have also been recorded. Common reed (Phragmites australis) is among the plant species growing along the edges of the canal. Measures to preserve and create water vole (Arvicola amphibius or A. terrestrisis) habitat have had considerable impact on the restoration of the canal, and new [...] "vole-friendly" [...] techniques of bank protection have been developed.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>common</b> <b>kingfisher</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th {{edition of his}} Systema Naturae in 1758 as Gracula atthis. [...] The modern binomial name derives from the Latin , [...] "kingfisher" [...] (from Greek , [...] ) and Atthis, {{a beautiful young woman}} of Lesbos, and favourite of Sappho.|$|E
2500|$|Like all kingfishers, the <b>common</b> <b>kingfisher</b> {{is highly}} territorial; since it must eat around 60% {{of its body}} weight each day, it is {{essential}} to have control of a suitable stretch of river. It is solitary for most of the year, roosting alone in heavy cover. If another kingfisher enters its territory, both birds display from perches, and fights may occur, in which a bird will grab the other's beak and try to hold it under water. Pairs form in the autumn but each bird retains a separate territory, generally at least [...] long, but up to [...] and territories are not merged until the spring.|$|E
50|$|These former clay pits have {{lakes and}} reedbeds. Birds include <b>common</b> terns, <b>kingfishers</b> and reed warblers, there are flowers such as beeorchids and emperor dragonflies. The site has yielded fossils of dinosaurs, {{crocodiles}} and turtles.|$|R
25|$|<b>Common</b> <b>kingfishers</b> are {{important}} members of ecosystems and good indicators of freshwater community health. The highest densities of breeding birds {{are found in}} habitats with clear water, which permits optimal prey visibility, and trees or shrubs on the banks. These habitats have also the highest quality of water, so {{the presence of this}} bird confirms the standard of the water. Measures to improve water flow can disrupt this habitat, and in particular, the replacement of natural banks by artificial confinement greatly reduces the populations of fish, amphibians and aquatic reptiles, and waterside birds are lost. It can tolerate a certain degree of urbanisation, provided the water remains clean.|$|R
50|$|Samples of {{bottom fauna}} taken in 1998 {{documented}} {{the presence of}} nationally rare species of gastropods such as Hippeutis complanatus and bivalve swan mussel; and during the preceding decades two species of limnetic gastropods were documented. Larvae of white-legged damselfly and blue-tailed damselfly were recorded in summer 2000. Signal crayfish and trout have been introduced in the stream, of which the former succeeded in establishing while roach {{is believed to be}} unfavourable to the latter. The white water rapids make a section of the stream ice-free during the winter time which attracts white-throated dippers and <b>common</b> <b>kingfishers.</b> In 1996, traces of beaver were reported.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>common</b> <b>kingfisher</b> {{typically}} lays two to ten glossy white eggs, which average [...] in breadth, [...] in length, {{and weigh}} about , of which 5% is shell. One or two eggs in most clutches fail to hatch because the parent cannot cover them. Both sexes incubate by day, {{but only the}} female at night. An incubating bird sits trance-like, facing the tunnel; it invariably casts a pellet, breaking {{it up with the}} bill. The eggs hatch in 19–20 days, and the altricial young are in the nest for a further 24–25 days, often more. Once large enough, young birds will come to the burrow entrance to be fed. Two broods, sometimes three, may be reared in a season.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>common</b> <b>kingfisher</b> hunts from a perch [...] {{above the}} water, on a branch, post or riverbank, bill {{pointing}} down as it searches for prey. It bobs its head when food is detected {{to gauge the}} distance, and plunges steeply down to seize its prey usually no deeper than [...] below the surface. The wings are opened under water and the open eyes are protected by the transparent third eyelid. The bird rises beak-first from the surface and flies back to its perch. At the perch the fish is adjusted until it is held near its tail and beaten against the perch several times. Once dead, the fish is positioned lengthways and swallowed head-first. A few times each day, a small greyish pellet of fish bones and other indigestible remains is regurgitated.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{coastal and}} some wetland areas, various water birds {{can come to}} {{contribute}} {{a large portion of}} both prey numbers and prey biomass. This may include more than 50 species of shorebird (from quite small sandpipers to the largest species of gull), more than 30 species of waterfowl, at least 10 species each of herons, 8 species of rails and any grebes or cormorants that are available. [...] The most regularly reported water bird prey in Europe were, roughly in this order, the [...] common moorhens (Gallinula chloropus), the [...] Eurasian coot (Fulica atra), [...] mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), [...] black-headed gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus), and the [...] Eurasian teal (Anas crecca). The diet of a handful of eagle-owl pairs in the Riau Islands Province of France were found to be dominated by water birds, especially the [...] yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis), the colonial abundance of which allowed the eagle-owls to atypically occupy these small islands. The diet of eagle-owls in Norway was dominated in coastal areas by water birds, overall for the nation 53% of the food was made of birds, the species most commonly identified as caught being the [...] mew gull (Larus canus), [...] Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) and [...] common eider (Somateria mollissima). Despite access to large seabird breeding colonies, almost all large bird species hunted in Norway, including large forest grouse in more inland areas, were apparently fully-grown adults and most water birds were caught while resting on open coastal waters. Eagle-owls in northwestern Poland, an area heavily dotted with lakes, relied on birds for about 64% of the diet, more than half of which were water birds. The main prey species there was the Eurasian coot, at nearly 15% of the prey numbers. [...] In Primorsky Krai in Russia, 53.2% of the food for the eagle-owls were made up of birds, predominantly water birds with the primary prey species being the [...] crested auklet (Aethia cristatella [...] ) (26.9%). In the Russian Far East, similarly, birds occupy up to 57.6% of the diet, a lion’s share of which are water birds. In this study, the grey red-backed vole and reed vole (Microtus fortis) were the most numerous identified individual species but in some years the extremely large Japanese cormorant (Phalacrocorax capillatus), at , were more numerous as prey than either vole. Water birds were found to be even more important in the diet in Korea, as in wetland habitat, with birds in general comprising 68.9% by number and 85.3% by biomass there, but in adjacent upland areas birds were slightly secondary to mammals, which made up 38.7% by number and 64.7% by biomass, led by the brown rat. [...] In Korea, the mallard and the similar spot-billed duck (Anas poecilorhyncha) made up 38.1% of the biomass. Other recorded bird species in the Eurasian eagle-owl’s diet includes most type of birds found in their range, including bustards, sandgrouse, parrots, cuckoos, swifts, the [...] hoopoe (Upupa epops), the [...] European bee-eater (Merops apiaster), the [...] <b>common</b> <b>kingfisher</b> (Alcedo atthis), the [...] European roller (Coracias garrulus), at least seven species of woodpecker (from the smallest to the largest European species) and more than 80 species of passerine. Among passerines, the only family reported widely as prey besides corvids are thrushes. In the Italian Alps, Turdus species were the fourth most frequently recorded type of prey. In particular, the abundant [...] Eurasian blackbird (Turdus merula) [...] is widely reported to be taken by eagle-owls. As thrushes are relatively small, at [...] among the species known to be predated, pairs in the Italian Alps who depended more so on thrushes usually showed lower productivity during nesting attempts.|$|E
50|$|The Kofiau paradise {{kingfisher}} (Tanysiptera ellioti) is a tree kingfisher {{endemic to}} the Indonesian island Kofiau. This little-known bird is sometimes considered a subspecies of the <b>common</b> paradise <b>kingfisher</b> (T. galatea), {{but it is}} morphologically distinct and del Hoyo lists it as a separate species.|$|R
25|$|Soil plays a {{different}} {{role in the}} burrow nest; here, the eggs and young—and {{in most cases the}} incubating parent bird—are sheltered under the earth. Most burrow-nesting birds excavate their own burrows, but some use those excavated by other species and are known as secondary nesters; burrowing owls, for example, sometimes use the burrows of prairie dogs, ground squirrels, badgers or tortoises, China's endemic white-browed tits use the holes of ground-nesting rodents and <b>common</b> <b>kingfishers</b> occasionally nest in rabbit burrows. Burrow nests are particularly common among seabirds at high latitudes, as they provide protection against both cold temperatures and predators. Puffins, shearwaters, some megapodes, motmots, todies, most kingfishers, the crab plover, miners and leaftossers are among the species which use burrow nests.|$|R
50|$|The buff-breasted paradise {{kingfisher}} inhabits lowland monsoon rainforest, {{and isolated}} patches of hill forest {{in areas where}} active termite mounds suitable for nesting are located. They usually perch in the mid-storey and lower canopy, coming to the ground to feed. In some areas they occur alongside the <b>common</b> paradise <b>kingfishers.</b>|$|R
