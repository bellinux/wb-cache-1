50|$|The first length {{standards}} {{to use this}} technique were rectangular section solid bars. A blind hole was bored at each end, to {{the depth of the}} neutral plane, and the <b>calibration</b> <b>marks</b> were made at this depth.

5000|$|When {{examining}} the signal on the expanded display, timing {{was based on}} 1/10th of a Gee unit, or 6.66 μs. This corresponds to a distance of 1.24 mi. It was assumed that an operator under good conditions could measure the peaks of the pulse envelope within a 1/10th of a <b>calibration</b> <b>mark,</b> or 0.124 mi. This is the basic accuracy of the Gee system, at least at shorter ranges and at [...] In practice the accuracy was a function of range from the transmitters, varying roughly with the square of distance. At short ranges accuracies of 165 yd were reported, while at long range over Germany it was quoted to about 1 mi.|$|E
50|$|Celsius {{used two}} fixed points in his scale: the {{temperature}} of melting ice and {{the temperature of}} boiling water. This wasn't a new idea, since Isaac Newton was already working on something similar. The distinction of Celsius was to use the condition of melting and not that of freezing. The experiments for reaching a good calibration of his thermometer lasted for 2 winters. By performing the same experiment over and over again, he discovered that ice always melted at the same <b>calibration</b> <b>mark</b> on the thermometer. He found a similar fixed point in the calibration of boiling water to water vapour (when this is done to high precision, a variation will be seen with atmospheric pressure; Celsius noted this). At the moment that he removed the thermometer from the vapour, the mercury level climbed slightly. This {{was related to the}} rapid cooling (and contraction) of the glass.|$|E
30|$|The {{significant}} influence of distillation time (including a quadratic influence) also corroborates our previous findings (Lachenmeier et al. 2006). It is clearly deleterious {{to remove the}} receiver too early during the distillation, when the ethanol transfer is not complete. No changes in alcohol content were observable at distillation times of 80  s or longer, but we typically recommend to distil as long as just below the <b>calibration</b> <b>mark</b> of the receiver to ensure a complete distillation, e.g. also in cases of spirits with higher alcoholic strengths (such as absinthes). For the same reason, {{it appears to be}} advantageous to shake the receiver during the distillation process, which may reduce the vapour pressure of ethanol due to immediate dilution, especially {{at the start of the}} distillation, and also reduce the volume due to the volume contraction effect of ethanol–water mixtures.|$|E
5000|$|In its {{simplest}} {{form the}} carriage holds the tool bit and moves it longitudinally (turning) or perpendicularly (facing) {{under the control}} of the operator. The operator moves the carriage manually via the handwheel (5a) or automatically by engaging the feed shaft with the carriage feed mechanism (5c). This provides some relief for the operator as the movement of the carriage becomes power assisted. The handwheels (2a, 3b, 5a) on the carriage and its related slides are usually calibrated, both for ease of use and to assist in making reproducible cuts. <b>Calibration</b> <b>marks</b> will measure either the distance from center (radius), or the work piece's diameter, so for example, on a diameter machine where <b>calibration</b> <b>marks</b> are in thousandths of an inch, the radial handwheel dial will read [...]0005 inches of radius per division, or [...]001 inches of diameter. The carriage typically comprises a top casting, known as the saddle (4), and a side casting, known as the apron (5).|$|R
50|$|A more {{convenient}} approach {{was used for}} the international prototype metre of 1870, a bar of platinum-iridium alloy which served as the definition of the meter from 1889 to 1960. This was made with a splayed H-shaped cross section, called the Tresca section. One surface of the centre crossbar of the H was designed to coincide with the neutral plane, and the <b>calibration</b> <b>marks</b> defining the meter were scribed into this surface.|$|R
5000|$|The Rømer {{scale is}} no longer in use but is of some {{historical}} importance. Alongside the Newton scale, it was the first calibrated scale.

30|$|In {{order to}} carry out the {{saponification}} of the carotenoids contained in the oleoresin, we first extracted the pigments from 50  mg of the oleoresin using 30  mL of HEAT solution (hexane, ethanol, acetone, toluene; 10 / 7 / 6 / 7; v/v/v/v) in a 100  mL volumetric flask. Subsequently, we added 2  mL of methanolic potassium hydroxide, stirred for 1  min and heated to 56  °C for 20  min. The neck of the flask was connected to a condenser to prevent evaporation and loss of solvent. After the heating time had passed, the flask was left to cool and kept in the dark for 1  h. We then added 30  mL of hexane, stirred the mix, and filled the flask to the <b>calibration</b> <b>mark</b> with a solution of Na 2 SO 4 (10 %). Before performing any analysis, we allowed the mix to stand in the dark for 1  h. To assess the effect of saponification on pigments, we performed a thin layer chromatography. For this, we used silica gel plates (60 F 254; 5  ×  10  cm) for analytical chromatography. After drawing the reference line at 0.5  cm from the bottom, we placed 20  μL of each sample solution in the plates. The concentration of the unsaponified oleoresin solution was 0.5  mg/mL, while the concentration of the saponified solution was 1  mg/mL. The sample was eluted with increasing proportions of a mixture of hexane and acetone (80 / 20, v/v) within a closed chamber. Before the stains migrated to the upper end, the plate was removed and dried with nitrogen flow.|$|E
30|$|The sample {{preparation}} was conducted as previously described (Lachenmeier et al. 2006). In short, {{the sample was}} temperated in a water bath at 20  °C. Following this, the sample was pipetted into a 250  mL Kjeldatherm digestion tube. Rests of the sample sticking {{to the edge of}} the tube were rinsed down with distilled water. Subsequently the tube was clamped in the distillation device. After placing a graduated flask filled with 3  mL of distilled water under the distillate outlet tubing, the program was started, and the distillation was automatically performed while occasionally shaking the receiver flask. After termination, the receiver and the tube were replaced and the hoses were rinsed with distilled water to be ready for the next sample. The graduated flask with the distillate was shaken, temperated in a water bath at 20  °C and filled up to the <b>calibration</b> <b>mark</b> with water (20  °C) and again shaken. The shaking steps of the flask are absolutely essential because a considerably inhomogeneity of the solution has been observed following distillation, which may lead to errors up to 5  % vol if the solution is not carefully homogenized. An aliquot of the distillate (about 20  mL) was filled into glass vials placed into the autosampler and the alcoholic strength was automatically determined with the oscillation-type density meter. As alternative to pipetting, samples (temperated at 20  °C) may be filled in graduated flasks, followed by filling the content of the flask into the Kjeldatherm digestion tube. The residues in the flask then need to be carefully rinsed 3 times with distilled water into the Kjeldatherm digestion tube.|$|E

Up to fifty-eight data channels located in all parts of the Hybrid III, from the head to the ankle, record between 30000 and 35000 data items in a typical 100–150millisecond crash.

The collision-induced broadening coefficients of hydrogen for more than 200 of these lines are reported. Also, by using the water-vapor lines which occur in the spectra as <b>calibration</b> <b>marks,</b> the frequencies of the broadened lines are determined.

5000|$|A Beckmann thermometer's {{length is}} usually 40 [...] - [...] 50 cm. The {{temperature}} scale typically covers about 5 °C {{and it is}} divided into hundredths of a degree.

The peculiarity of Beckmann's thermometer design is a reservoir (R on diagram) at {{the upper end of the}} tube, by means of which the quantity of mercury in the bulb can be increased or diminished so that the instrument can be set to measure temperature differences at either high or low temperature values.

30|$|The {{determination}} of the alcoholic strength in spirits and liqueurs is required to control the labelling of alcoholic beverages. The reference methodology prescribes a distillation step followed by densimetric measurement. The classic distillation using a Vigreux rectifying column and a West condenser is time consuming and error-prone, especially for liqueurs that may have problems with entrainment and charring. For this reason, this methodology suggests {{the use of an}} automated steam distillation device as alternative. The novel instrument comprises an increased steam power, a redesigned geometry of the condenser and a larger cooling coil with controllable flow, compared to previously available devices. Method optimization applying D-optimal and central composite designs showed significant influence of sample volume, distillation time and coolant flow, while other investigated parameters such as steam power, receiver volume, or the use of pipettes or flasks for sample measurement did not significantly influence the results. The method validation was conducted using the following settings: steam power 70  %, sample volume 25  mL transferred using pipettes, receiver volume 50  mL, coolant flow 7 L/min, and distillation time as long as possible just below the <b>calibration</b> <b>mark.</b> For four different liqueurs covering the typical range of these products between 15 and 35  % vol, the method showed an adequate precision, with relative standard deviations below 0.4  % (intraday) and below 0.6  % (interday). The absolute standard deviations were between 0.06  % vol and 0.08  % vol (intraday) and between 0.07  % vol and 0.10  % vol (interday). The improved automatic steam distillation devices offer an excellent alternative for sample cleanup of volatiles from complex matrices. A major advantage are the low costs for consumables per analysis (only distilled water is needed). For alcoholic strength determination, the method has become more rugged than before, and there are only few influences that would lead to incomplete distillation. Our validation parameters have shown that the performance of the method corresponds to the data presented for the reference method and we believe that automated steam distillation, can be used for the purpose of labelling control of alcoholic beverages.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Camera {{calibration}} is {{an indispensable}} step for augmented reality or image guided applications where quantitative {{information should be}} derived from the images. Usually, a camera calibration is obtained by taking images of a special calibration object and extracting the image coordinates of projected <b>calibration</b> <b>marks</b> enabling the calculation of the projection from the 3 d world coordinates to the 2 d image coordinates. Thus such a procedure exhibits typical steps, including feature point localization in the acquired images, camera model fitting, correction of distortion introduced by the optics and finally an optimization of the model’s parameters. In this paper we propose to extend this list by further step concerning {{the identification of the}} optimal subset of images yielding the smallest overall calibration error. For this, we present a Monte Carlo based algorithm along with a deterministic extension that automatically determines the images yielding an optimal calibration. Finally, we present results proving that the calibration can be significantly improved by automated image selection...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{modeling}} the image point motion as {{function of the}} degree of zoom and focus is described and evaluated. The method requires that the camera can be translated towards a frontoparallel grid of <b>calibration</b> <b>marks.</b> The evaluation shows that, for a translation span of 2 meters, a zoom range from 10 to 96 millimeter, and for focus settings between 1 meter and infinity, the average prediction error for the zoom camera available is about 0. 45 pixel. 1 Introduction In exploratory active vision the image sensor is controlled to obtain the most relevant data with respect to the task being performed. To obtain images of optimal quality, the focus of the camera has to be adjusted continuously according to the distance between the camera and the scene area explored. For certain types of analysis a broad field of view is advantageous, for other types of analysis a close-up on specific scene structures is necessary. Thus, the ability, under program control, to change zoom and focus is im [...] ...|$|R

40|$|A few star {{clusters}} in the Magellanic Clouds exhibit composite {{structures in the}} red-clump region of their colour-magnitude diagrams. The most striking case is NGC 419 in the SMC, where the red clump is composed of a main blob {{as well as a}} distinct secondary feature. This structure is demonstrated to be real and corresponds to the simultaneous presence of stars which passed through electron degeneracy after central-hydrogen exhaustion and those that did not. This rare occurrence in a single cluster allows us to set stringent constraints on its age and on the efficiency of convective-core overshooting during main-sequence evolution. We present a more detailed analysis of NGC 419, together with a first look at other populous LMC clusters which are apparently in the same phase: NGC 1751, NGC 1783, NGC 1806, NGC 1846, NGC 1852 and NGC 1917.

40|$|The {{estimation}} of {{the parameters of the}} visual system is an indispensable step for augmented reality or image guided applications where quantitative information should be derived from the images. Usually, the estimation process is called camera calibration and it is performed by observing a special calibration object from different directions. From these observations the image coordinates of the projected <b>calibration</b> <b>marks</b> are extracted and the mapping from the 3 D world coordinates to the 2 D image coordinates is calculated. To attain a well-suited mapping, the calibration images must suffice certain constraints {{in order to ensure that}} the underlying mathematical algorithms are well-posed. Thus, the choice of the input images influences the estimation process and consequence the quality of the derived information. In this paper we present a generic approach for camera calibration that is robust against ill-posed configurations. For this, we apply combinatorial optimization technique in order to determine the optimal subset of the pool of acquired images yielding the best calibration result with respect to the model fit error. Our approach is generic in the sense that it is independent of a certain calibration algorithm because it only makes use of a quality measure that acts as an objective function for the optimization...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Motion capture is {{the process}} of {{recording}} real life movement of a subject as sequences of Cartesian coordinates in 3 D space. Optical motion capture (OMC) uses cameras to reconstruct the body posture of the performer. One approach employs a set of multiple synchronized cameras to capture markers placed in strategic locations on the body. A motion capture system has applications in computer graphics for character animation, in virtual reality for human control-interface, and in video games for realistic simulation of human motion. In this tutorial, we discuss the theoretical and empirical aspects of an optical motion capture system. Basically, for a motion capture system implementation; the resources required consist of a number of synchronized cameras, an image acquisition system, a capturing area, and a special suit with markers. The locations of the markers on the suit are designed such that the required body parts (e. g. joints) are covered. We present our motion capture system using a framework that identifies different sub-problems to be solved in a modular way. The sub-problems involved in OMC are initialization, marker detection, spatial correspondence, temporal correspondence, and post-processing. In this tutorial, we discuss the theory involved in each sub-problem and the corresponding novel techniques used in the current implementation.

Crop growth simulation has made valuable contributions to yield forecasting, proto-typing crop varieties, generation of input-output coefficients for improved agricultural production technologies and to management decision support systems at field level. Likewise, remote sensing techniques have been successfully applied in classification of arable crops and in quantification of vegetation characteristics at different spatial and temporal scales. The starting point of this study was the hypothesis that integration of both techniques would lead to improvements in the dynamic simulation of the crop-soil system and thus contribute to improvements in management decision support systems for environmentally sound agricultural production. Thus far, mutually beneficial linkages have been limited to land use classification via remote sensing (choice of adequate model) and quantification of crop growth and development curves using e. g. estimates of leaf area indices derived from remote sensing images for model calibration under (usually) favourable growth conditions. Only a few studies have considered the potentials of remote sensing for model initialization of growth and development characteristics of a specific crop. In this thesis these potentials have been extended to a more continuous approach, in which remote sensing information is not only used in model initialization, but also in model calibration in the course of the simulation run, so-called run-time calibration. During such a run-time calibration procedure, simulated values of e. g. leaf area index (LAI) and canopy nitrogen status (CNS) are replaced by values estimated from remote sensing images acquired at different stages in the course of the growing period. LAI and CNS are important controlling variables in models for arable crops such as wheat, potato and maize. This run-time calibration procedure has been performed for a full crop growth cycle, for optimal as well as sub-optimal growth conditions. This approach enables spatial differentiation in crop growth simulation, as variations in crop status, resulting from differences in growth conditions, lead to differences in remote sensing signals. The relationships between near and remote sensing observations at leaf, plant and canopy level have been investigated and the effects of variations in estimated values of LAI and CNS used in run-time calibration of dynamic crop growth simulation models on final model results (e. g. crop yield) have been analyzed. Results from potato trials in the Netherlands show that leaf nitrogen contents derived from near sensing observations can be up-scaled to plant and canopy nitrogen status by taking into account the vertical nitrogen distribution in the crop. A vertical nitrogen extinction coefficient (k n) of 0. 41 resulted in an accuracy increase of the relation between leaf nitrogen (g N m - 2 leaf) and SPAD readings (a near sensing technique at leaf level), with a correlation coefficient (r 2) of 0. 91. Remote sensing observations integrate nitrogen contents over canopy depth and do not require adjustment for vertical nitrogen gradients, if canopy nitrogen status is expressed in total nitrogen content per unit of soil surface. The red edge position (an index derived from remote sensing observations) could be related to canopy nitrogen content (g N m - 2 soil) with a correlation coefficient (r 2) of 0. 82. Leaf area indices of potato (Netherlands) and maize (Argentina, France, USA) crops, for use in run-time calibration, were also accurately derived from field, airborne and spaceborne remote sensing platforms. Introducing LAI values derived from RS in the simulation model and concurrently adjusting CNS by retaining leaf N-concentrations, led to more accurate simulation results for CNS than without such adjustment. The different crops, and the range in environmental conditions, soil fertility status and management practices that were examined in the different case-studies in this thesis, have demonstrated the broad applicability of mechanistic simulation models integrated with remote sensing information Winter wheat fields, wheat phenological stages (emergence, flowering) and management operations (harvest) were successfully identified on the basis of information from optical and radar remote sensing data in a case-study in South-eastern France. Timing of these phenological stages and management operations is important in model <b>calibration</b> as they <b>mark</b> the length of the crop growth period and of the grain-filling period, which are co-determinants of grain yield. At flowering, C-band radar backscatter from the soil is maximally reduced by canopy moisture content. This characteristic was successfully used to estimate regional wheat flowering dates. Integration of RS data in the (point-based) crop growth simulation model allowed its spatial application for prediction of wheat production at regional scale. The estimated value was in agreement with regional yield statistics. This integration thus allows expansion of the application area of valuable research tools, as up-scaling has become feasible. Introduction of remote sensing-based estimates of LAI and CNS in the course of the growing seasons into dynamic simulation of the growth of potato and maize resulted in improved simulation accuracy for aerial crop characteristics, as well as for variables that could not be directly observed by remote sensing, such as soil inorganic nitrogen contents. The degree of success and robustness of the integrated approach depends on the timing, accuracy and number of remote sensing observations available for re-setting the relevant state variables in the course of the simulation period. Simulation accuracy was positively correlated with the number of observation dates from remote sensing. Remote sensing observations around flowering had more impact on calculated final grain yield (FGY) for maize than earlier or later observations. The investigations reported in this thesis have shown that the accuracy of predictions of dynamic and mechanistic crop growth simulation models significantly improves through integrating earth observation-derived information as input for the models and for their run-time calibration. Such integration not only yields more accurate estimates of crop bio-physical variables, such as leaf area index and canopy nitrogen status, but also contributes to improved prediction at regional scales. Such models, producing reliable, site-specific predictions of crop performance and crop requirements are thus effective tools in the development of environmentally-friendly production methods and in optimizing the use of our natural resources. Further research should focus on the scope for estimating additional crop variables of interest for integration in simulation modelling through remote sensing. Management interventions may be triggered by various crop characteristics, such as: 1) canopy temperatures derived from thermal remote sensing systems as an indicator for water stress, 2) canopy discolouring derived from optical remote sensing systems as an indicator for nutrient shortages and 3) canopy architecture derived from radar remote sensing images as an indicator for water and nutrient supply. Remote sensing is also a valuable technique to identify spatial patterns of crop performance and crop status within arable fields. Moreover, remote sensing allows identification of patterns that may be related to specific diseases or special events, such as outbreaks of phytophtera in potato, or lodging in grain crops. This study has demonstrated that a decision support system for crop and soil management based on the integration of crop growth simulation modelling and remotely sensed data is within reach. In addition, nitrogen uptake, its vertical distribution within the crop, and the inorganic nitrogen content of the soil can be simulated more accurately with such an integrated system. Such a decision support system can be used for fine-tuning of fertilizer regimes thus contributing to more environmentally sound and sustained agricultural production...|$|R
