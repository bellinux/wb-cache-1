40|$|Article abstract: (6507 View) Background: The aim of <b>continuous</b> medical <b>education</b> is {{to improve}} physicians' performance. Unfortunately, most of the efforts which {{have been done in}} recent years for {{achieving}} this goal have been ineffective. Using ineffective educational methods and techniques are probably the major cause of this deficiency. Consumer-based models such as social marketing model can be used efficiently in the field of medical education. Social marketing is “the use of commercial marketing concepts and tools in programs designed to influence individual’s behavior to improve their well being and that of the society”. In this paper the main concepts and principles of social marketing model have been explained. Consumer analysis, market analysis, and channel analysis are the main concepts of social marketing {{that can be used in}} the field of <b>continuous</b> medical <b>education.</b> Conclusion: Although planning educational programs based on the mentioned principles seems to impose more expenses, it increases the probability of success and can affect physicians’ behavior more than other applied programs.

40|$|Background: Rheumatologic {{diseases}} are common and frequently managed by primary care physicians. Aim: To assess strengths, weaknesses and self confidence {{of primary care}} physicians {{in the management of}} rheumatic diseases. Material and methods: A self assessment and anonymous questionnaire was mailed to primary care physicians of two Chilean regions. Using a 10 points Likert scale, they were asked about personal interest, undergraduate training, <b>continuous</b> medical <b>education,</b> availability of medical literature, complementary laboratory tests and consultation with a rheumatologist. Medical skills, knowledge, therapeutic approach and performance of rheumatologic procedures were evaluated under the item confidence. Results: Three hundred forty seven out of 763 physicians (45 %) answered the questionnaire. Their age range extended from 25 to 75 years, 59 % were male, 58 % were Chilean and 74 % worked in the Metropolitan region. The worst evaluated parameters were availability of literature with a score of 2. 2 +/- 2, access to consultation with a rbeumatologist (3. 8 +/- 2. 2) and to <b>continuous</b> medical <b>education</b> (4. 3 +/- 2. 7). Physicians bad a better confidence in their knowledge (6. 7 +/- 1. 5) and in their therapeutic approach (6. 1 +/- 1. 5). The worst confidence score was for shoulder injection therapy (3. 4 +/- 2. 6). <b>Continuous</b> medical <b>education</b> correlated with knowledge but not with clinical skills. Conclusions. Primary care physicians perform a bad assessment of their skills in rheumatology. They have a low level of confidence in their clinical skills to perform rheumatologic procedures. <b>Continuous</b> medical <b>education</b> improves confidence in knowledge but not in skills...|$|R
