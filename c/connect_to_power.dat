5000|$|At the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show, modular {{computer}} hardware company Xi3 Corporation introduced a prototype modular PC codenamed [...] "Piston".

Xi3 began taking pre-orders for the Piston Console at the 2013 South by Southwest Festival in March 2013, anticipating high levels of interest in the hardware with plans to release the unit for general purchase by the end of 2013. Valve has clarified that although they conducted some initial exploratory work with Xi3, they have had no direct involvement with the Piston's specifications, and it is not necessarily representative of the final design for the Steam Box.|$|E
5000|$|The troller design {{frequently}} {{fell off}} the wires, and was soon replaced by other more reliable devices, the trolley pole and notably the bow collector. Both were fitted {{to the top of}} the car and were spring-loaded in order to keep, respectively, a small trolley wheel or grooved lubricated [...] "skate" [...] mounted at the top of the pole or a steel rod forming the top of the bow firmly in contact with the underside of the overhead wire. The terms trolley pole and trolley wheel both derive from the troller. Trams using trolley-pole current collection are normally powered through a single pole, with return current earthed through the steel wheels and rails, though some systems (e.g. parts of the London system), used twin overhead wires and poles to avoid the effects of stray currents flowing through the earth. Modern trams often have an overhead pantograph mechanical linkage to <b>connect</b> <b>to</b> <b>power,</b> abandoning the trolley pole altogether.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} EFB precursors {{came from}} individual pilots {{in the early}} 1990s who used their personal laptops and common software (such as spreadsheets and word processing applications) to perform such functions as weight and balance calculations and filling out operational forms. One of the earliest and broadest EFB implementations was in 1991 when FedEx deployed their Airport Performance Laptop Computer to carry out aircraft performance calculations on the aircraft (this was a commercial off-the-shelf computer and was considered portable). In addition, FedEx also began deploying Pilot Access Terminals on their airplane in the mid-1990s. These later devices were common laptops that used a certified docking station on the airplanes (to <b>connect</b> <b>to</b> <b>power</b> and data interfaces). In 1996, Aero Lloyd, a German carrier, introduced two laptops to compute the performance and access the documentation. The system called FMD (Flight Management Desktop) permits Aero Lloyd to remove all the documentation and RTOW in paper from the cockpit with the Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (German Civil Aviation Authority) agreement. Other companies, including Southwest followed with [...] "carry-on" [...] performance computers, but they remained on the airplane as a practical matter. JetBlue took a different approach by converting all of its operations documents to electronic format and distributing them over a network to laptop computers that were issued to pilots (versus to the airplane). The first true EFB, designed specifically to replace a pilot's entire kit bag, was patented by Angela Masson as the Electronic Kit Bag (EKB) in 1999. In 2005 the first commercial Class 2 EFB STC (STC No. ST03165AT) was issued that covered the installation of provisions for the deployment of the navAero t•BagC22 EFB computer and touchscreen display system. The installation was performed by Avionics Support Group, Inc. onto a Miami Air Boeing B737NG. The EFB t•Pad display was deployed using the US Patented (8231081) EFB mounting solution, the cfMount™ [...] The EFB data was updated using a Terminal Wireless Unit (TWLU) installed at Miami Air's facility, that enabled the EFB to update only the files that had changed on the server. In 2006 MyTravel (a UK charter operation now merged with Thomas Cook airline) became the first to deploy an electronic tech log using GPRS communication, replacing the paper process. Thomas Cook has several years of successful operational experience of an EFB focussed on its UK fleet.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{deals with}} the {{implementation}} of cascade multilevel inverter-based STATCOM, which employs H-bridge inverter. The STATCOM system is modeled using the d-q transform, which calculates the instantaneous reactive power. In this paper, a power line conditioner using a cascade multilevel inverter is presented for voltage regulation, harmonic filtering and reactive power compensation (var). 11 level STATCOM is selected as demonstration. The cascade multilevel converter consists of five single-phase full bridges in which each bridge has its own DC source. This new inverter can: 1) It can eliminate transformers of multilevel inverters used in conventional static var compensators; 2) make possible to direct <b>connect</b> <b>to</b> <b>power</b> distribution system in parallel and series without any transformer; 3) generate almost sinusoidal voltage. This paper focuses on feasibility and control schemes of the cascade inverter foe voltage regulation and harmonic filtering in distribution systems. The results are analyzed and discussed.

40|$|Abstract – Due to {{aggressive}} {{scaling of}} device feature size to improve circuit {{performance in the}} sub-wavelength lithography regime, both diffusion and poly gate shapes are no longer rectilinear. Diffusion rounding occurs most notably where the diffusion shapes are not perfectly rectangular, including common L and T-shaped diffusion layouts to <b>connect</b> <b>to</b> <b>power</b> rails. This paper investigates {{the impact of the}} non-rectilinear shape of diffusion (i. e., sloped diffusion or diffusion rounding) on circuit performance (delay and leakage). Simple weighting function models for Ion and I off to account for the diffusion rounding effects are proposed, and compared with TCAD simulation. Our experiments show that diffusion rounding has an asymmetric characteristic for I off due to the differing significance of source/drain junctions on device threshold voltage. Therefore, we can model I on and I off as a function of slope angle and direction. The proposed models match well with TCAD simulation results, with less than 2 % and 6 % error in I on and I off, respectively. Figure 1.

40|$|Abstract With the {{development}} of wind generation, the calculation of available transfer capability (denoted as ATC) considering wind generation has very high application value. Based on the maximum function, this paper presents an ATC model. The characteristic of the new model is twofold. First, it considers wind turbines <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>power</b> system and static security of power system simultaneously. Second, it is a system of semismooth equations. By using the smoothing strategy, a smoothing Newton method is adopted for solving the proposed new ATC model. Numerical simulation results of the IEEE 30 -bus and 118 -bus system show the new model and algorithm are feasible and effective. The impact of wind turbines <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>power</b> system on ATC is analyzed. ...|$|R
