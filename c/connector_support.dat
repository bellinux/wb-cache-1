5000|$|The iPad has a 9.7-inch screen. Compared to the iPad Air 2, the {{processor}} is updated from the Apple A8X to the A9 with the embedded Apple M9 motion co-processor. The iPad has 2 gigabytes of RAM. It is 7.5mm thick, {{which is the}} same thickness as the iPad Air, compared to 6.1mm of the iPad Air 2. Unlike other iPad models available, this iPad's display is not fully laminated and does not have anti-reflective coating. However, this iPad has a brighter screen than the iPad Air 2 (25% brighter according to Apple). It is available in 32 and 128 gigabyte storage options. Contrasting with the iPad Pro lineup, this iPad features only two speakers (as opposed to four), has no Smart <b>Connector</b> <b>support,</b> and has no flash on the back. It is offered in silver, gold, and space grey colors. Despite its use of the Apple A9 processor and accompanying M9 motion co-processor, introduced with the iPhone 6S in 2015, the iPad does not feature support for always-on [...] "Hey Siri" [...] voice input, a feature advertised as being made possible by low-power processing in the then-new chips. The use of [...] "Hey Siri" [...] is limited to when the iPad is connected to power.|$|E
40|$|Despite being a widely-used {{language}} for specifying software systems, UML remains {{less than ideal}} for software architectures. Architecture description languages (ADLs) were developed to provide more comprehensive support. However, so far the application of ADLs in practice has been impeded {{by at least one}} of the following problems: (i) advanced formal notations requiring a steep learning curve, (ii) lack of support for user-defined, complex connectors, and (iii) potentially unrealizable architectural designs. This paper proposes Xcd, a new ADL that aims at supporting user-defined, complex connectors to help increase architectural modularity. It also aims to help increase the degree of reusability, as now components need not specify interaction protocols, as these can be specified independently by connectors (which increases protocol reusability too). <b>Connector</b> <b>support</b> requires to ensure that architectural designs are always realizable, as it is currently extremely easy to obtain unrealizable ones. Xcd eliminates potentially unrealizable constructs in connector specifications. Finally, Xcd employs a notation and notions from Design-by-Contract (DbC) for specifying software architecture behaviour. While DbC promotes a formal and precise way of specifying system behaviours, it is not as challenging for practising developers as process algebras that are usually employed by ADLs...|$|E

50|$|The {{specification}} {{introduces a}} reversible 32-pin superMHL connector, which (along with USB Type-C) supports a higher charging power {{of up to}} 40 W (20 V / 2 A), and is designed for future bandwidth expansion. The increase in bandwidth over previous MHL versions is achieved by using multiple A/V lanes, each operating at 6 Gbit/s, with a maximum of six A/V lanes supported depending on device and connector type. For example, Micro-USB and HDMI Type-A support one A/V lane, USB Type-C supports up to four A/V lanes, and the superMHL <b>connector</b> <b>supports</b> up to six A/V lanes (36 Gbit/s).|$|R
50|$|Some {{computers}} {{or their}} sound cards have 15-pin D-subminiature connectors, called game ports, {{that can be}} used for MIDI IN/MIDI OUT. The <b>connector</b> <b>supports</b> both MIDI and analog joystick functions. Access to the MIDI signals is provided by a short adapter cable that converts the D-subminiature pinout into DIN connectors. The recommended method of connecting two 5-pin DIN cables to a 15-pin D-subminiature computer port can be found at the MIDI.org web site. The MIDI specification very conservatively states that the maximum distance MIDI can be transmitted is 15 meters (50 feet), but it can normally go much farther.|$|R

40|$|The {{architecture}} of a software system {{shows how the}} system is constructed from components. The properties of the system depend critically {{on the character of}} the interactions among the components. Although software designers have good informal abstractions for these interactions, the abstractions are poorly supported by the available languages and tools. UniCon provides a rich selection of abstractions for the connectors that mediate interactions among components. To create systems using the connector abstractions, you need to produce and integrate not only the object code for components, but also a variety of other run-time products. To extend the set of <b>connectors</b> <b>supported</b> by UniCon, you need to identify and isolate many kinds of information in the compiler, graphical editor, and associated tools. This paper describes the role of connector abstractions in software design, the <b>connector</b> abstractions currently <b>supported</b> by UniCon, and implementation issues associated with supporting an open-ended collection of connectors...|$|R
