5|$|Even {{before the}} Old Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had {{developed}} a glassy material known as faience, which they treated {{as a type of}} artificial semi-precious stone. Faience is a non-clay ceramic made of silica, small amounts of lime and soda, and a colorant, typically copper. The material was used to make beads, tiles, figurines, and small wares. Several methods can be used to create faience, but typically production involved application of the powdered materials {{in the form of a}} paste over a <b>clay</b> <b>core,</b> which was then fired. By a related technique, the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as Egyptian Blue, also called blue frit, which is produced by fusing (or sintering) silica, copper, lime, and an alkali such as natron. The product can be ground up and used as a pigment.|$|E

The magnitude of the film thicknesses apparently developed insolutions as concentrated as molar and 4 M, where the condition of ideal solutions required by diffuse double layer theory is certainly not fulfilled, seems to indicate that solution uptake is increased by a relaxation of structural strains within the clay matrix on lubrication by solutions. These strains may arise from the distortion of crystals in packing during the drying process. Such relaxations which appear to occur between pF 4 and 3 could initiate the development of a gel structure...|$|R
2500|$|Earth-fill dams, {{also called}} earthen dams, rolled-earth dams or simply earth dams, are {{constructed}} {{as a simple}} embankment of well compacted earth. A [...] rolled-earth dam is entirely constructed of one type of material but may contain a drain layer to collect seep water. A zoned-earth dam has distinct parts or zones of dissimilar material, typically a locally plentiful shell with a watertight <b>clay</b> <b>core.</b> Modern zoned-earth embankments employ filter and drain zones to collect and remove seep water and preserve {{the integrity of the}} downstream shell zone. An outdated method of zoned earth dam construction utilized a hydraulic fill to produce a watertight core.

40|$|Shale {{instability}} {{is one of}} {{the ongoing}} major problems when drilling oil/gas wellbores. The interaction of aqueous drilling fluids or fracturing fluids, with reactive clay minerals in shales causes swelling, in turn causing costly wellbore instabilities. In this study, the swelling of compacted commercial Na-bentonite <b>clay</b> mineral <b>cores</b> was investigated using a novel non-contact displacement meter with various organic solvents and salt solutions as the electrolyte. Swelling results with organic solvents were correlated with the dielectric constant, dipole moment, surface tension and viscosity of the solvent. It was found that swelling rate and total swelling were proportional to dielectric constant and inversely proportional to viscosity, representing the chemical and capillary components of swelling, respectively. Results of swelling tests with salt solutions are discussed in the context of diffuse double layer (DDL) theory. Swelling behaviour of smectite clay minerals were found to be highly affected by cation concentration. Tests with CaCl 2 solutions showed that divalent cations were effective at suppressing swelling at low concentrations. At high concentrations KCl and KI solutions were more effective at inhibiting swelling owing to the lower hydration enthalpy of K+ cations. Repeats of selected tests with non-swelling illite rich shale compacted cores were compared with the swelling Na-bentonite <b>clay</b> mineral compacted <b>cores.</b> Comparison between Na-bentonite and illite swelling shows that, for reconstituted compacted cores, the initial stage of clay swelling is dominated by capillary action. Then, depending on the reactivity of the clay and the medium, chemical swelling occurs. Consequently, the swelling behaviour of compacted <b>clay</b> <b>cores,</b> as used by many drilling fluid research laboratories, is highly dependent on the domination of different swelling components in different time periods as an artefact of the sample preparation and care should be taken when using ground and compacted shales to assess either reactivity of shale formations to drilling fluids or the effectiveness of swelling inhibitor systems...|$|R

40|$|Ocean-floor carbonate- and clay-rich sediments form major inputs to {{subduction}} zones, {{especially at}} low-latitude convergent plate margins. Therefore, {{knowledge of their}} frictional behaviour is fundamental for understanding plate-boundary earthquakes. Here we report results of mechanical tests performed on simulated fault gouges prepared from ocean-floor carbonates and <b>clays,</b> <b>cored</b> during IODP drilling offshore Costa Rica. Clay-rich gouges show internal friction coefficients (that is, the slope of linearized shear stress versus normal stress data) of Î¼int = 0. 44 âˆ’ 0. 56, irrespective of temperature and pore-fluid pressure (Pf). By contrast, Î¼int for the carbonate gouge strongly depends on temperature and pore-fluid pressure, with Î¼int decreasing dramatically from 0. 84 at room temperature and Pf = 20 [*]MPa to 0. 27 at T = 140 [*]Â°C and Pf = 120 [*]MPa. This effect provides a fundamental mechanism of shear localization and earthquake generation in subduction zones, and makes carbonates likely nucleation sites for plate-boundary earthquakes.
