In the end, Congress watered down the bill, setting the tax rates at 7 to 27% and largely exempting small enterprises.

The main variables of interest in our study are the activities of outside directors in board meetings, the establishment of an audit committee, concentrated ownership and foreign ownership.

A multiple hypotheses testing method is employed to identify causal relations among the three financial variables and to test the empirical implications of dividend smoothing and signaling models. The results show that dynamic relations exist among dividends, earnings and prices. Empirical evidence is consistent with the contention that dividend changes are often driven by both signaling and smoothing motives. Additional tests are developed to differentiate between the dividend signaling and smoothing models. These tests impose restrictions on the dynamics of the financial variables and information signaling.
