5|$|In 1992, {{members of}} the European Union signed the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their deficit {{spending}} and debt levels. However, in the early 2000s, some EU member states were failing {{to stay within the}} confines of the Maastricht criteria and turned to securitising future government revenues to reduce their debts and/or deficits, sidestepping best practice and ignoring international standards. This allowed the sovereigns to mask their deficit and debt levels through a combination of techniques, including inconsistent accounting, off-balance-sheet transactions, and the use of complex currency and <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> structures. From late 2009 on, after Greece's newly elected, PASOK government stopped masking its true indebtedness and budget deficit, fears of sovereign defaults in certain European states developed in the public, and the government debt of several states was downgraded. The crisis subsequently spread to Ireland and Portugal, while raising concerns about Italy, Spain, and the European banking system, and more fundamental imbalances within the eurozone.|$|E
25|$|The {{derivatives}} team at JPMorgan (including Blythe Masters) was {{a pioneer}} in the invention of <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> such as the credit default swap. The first CDS was created to allow Exxon to borrow money from JPMorgan while JPMorgan transferred the risk to the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. JPMorgan's team later created the 'BISTRO', a bundle of credit default swaps that was the progenitor of the Synthetic CDO. JPMorgan currently has the largest credit default swap and <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> portfolio by total notional amount of any US bank.|$|E

25|$|A CDS {{contract}} is typically documented under a confirmation referencing the <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> definitions as {{published by the}} International Swaps and Derivatives Association.

25|$|Management must {{attempt to}} match the {{long-term}} financing mix to the assets being financed as closely as possible, {{in terms of both}} timing and cash flows. Managing any potential asset liability mismatch or duration gap entails matching the assets and liabilities respectively according to maturity pattern ("Cashflow matching") or duration ("immunization"); managing this relationship in the short-term is a major function of working capital management, as discussed below.

2500|$|Off balance sheet: Derivative (finance) of {{many types}} {{have in the}} past been {{referred}} to as [...] "off-balance-sheet." [...] This term implies that the use of derivatives has no balance sheet impact. While there are differences among the various accounting standards internationally, there is a general trend towards the requirement to record derivatives at fair value on the balance sheet. There is also a generally accepted principle that, where derivatives are being used as a hedge against underlying assets or liabilities, accounting adjustments are required to ensure that the gain/loss on the hedged instrument is recognized in the income statement on a similar basis as the underlying assets and liabilities. Certain <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> products, particularly Credit Default Swaps, now have more or less universally accepted market standard documentation. In the case of Credit Default Swaps, this documentation has been formulated by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) who have for a long time provided documentation on how to treat such derivatives on balance sheets.|$|E

50|$|A {{credit default swap}} {{index is}} a <b>credit</b> <b>derivative</b> used to hedge credit risk or to take a {{position}} on a basket of credit entities. Unlike a credit default swap, which is an over the counter <b>credit</b> <b>derivative,</b> a <b>credit</b> default swap index is a completely standardised credit security and may therefore be more liquid and trade at a smaller bid-offer spread. This means that it can be cheaper to hedge a portfolio of credit default swaps or bonds with a CDS index than it would be to buy many single name CDS to achieve a similar effect. Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting investors owning bonds against default, and traders use them to speculate on changes in credit quality.|$|R
