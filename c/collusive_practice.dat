Given that previous research on <b>collusive</b> <b>practices</b> concentrates mainly on the bidding phase, this study extended the research focus to the entire construction period and aimed to investigate specific <b>collusive</b> <b>practices</b> in Chinese construction projects. A total of 22 specific <b>collusive</b> <b>practices</b> in Chinese construction projects were first identified based on a comprehensive literature review and a Delphi survey with 15 industry experts. Then, a questionnaire survey was conducted to prioritize the identified <b>collusive</b> <b>practices</b> {{in terms of their}} probability and severity. The survey results indicate that the primary <b>collusive</b> <b>practices</b> in Chinese construction projects are misrepresentation of qualification certificates, loose site supervision, misusing prequalification requirements, fake tendering, approval of the unnecessary change orders, collective collusive tendering by helping one another, the nomination of a particular supplier, issuing certified works falsely, and inflating tender price. The findings of the study not only provide a clearer picture of <b>collusive</b> <b>practices</b> in construction projects in China but also provide a better understanding of <b>collusive</b> <b>practices</b> in other emerging economies.

40|$|Non-competitive bids have {{recently}} {{become a major}} concern in both Public and Private sector construction contract auctions. Consequently, several models {{have been developed to}} help identify bidders potentially involved in <b>collusive</b> <b>practices.</b> However, most of these models require complex calculations and extensive information that is difficult to obtain. The aim {{of this paper is to}} utilize recent developments for detecting abnormal bids in capped auctions (auctions with an upper bid limit set by the auctioner) and extend them to the more conventional uncapped auctions (where no such limits are set). To accomplish this, a new method is developed for estimating the values of bid distribution supports by using the solution to what has become known as the German tank problem. The model is then demonstrated and tested on a sample of real construction bid data and shown to detect cover bids with high accuracy.

25|$|United States {{antitrust}} {{law is a}} collection of federal and state government laws that regulates the conduct and organization of business corporations, generally to promote fair competition for the benefit of consumers. (The concept is called competition law in other English-speaking countries.) The main statutes are the Sherman Act 1890, the Clayton Act 1914 and the Federal Trade Commission Act 1914. These Acts, first, restrict the formation of cartels and prohibit other <b>collusive</b> <b>practices</b> regarded as being in restraint of trade. Second, they restrict the mergers and acquisitions of organizations that could substantially lessen competition. Third, they prohibit the creation of a monopoly and the abuse of monopoly power.|$|R

We extend the symmetrical duopoly under uncertainty model by Dixit and Pindyck (1994), by granting a patent to the first innovator that files an application. The patent-investment race model is used to focus on long-term collusive agreements signed under a cooperative bargaining structure. The contributions are as follows. First, we show that, in a stochastic framework, competition always leads to different forms of inefficiency. Second, it is proved that, when entrepreneurs can sign long-term contracts via cooperative bargaining, collusion is always beneficial ex-ante since inefficiency disappears. Third, we show that whilst collusion always delays innovation, {{it does not necessarily}} delay competition. Depending on a number of economic, as well as firm-specific factors, collusion can actually accelerate competition.

40|$|Abstract. Voluntary {{environmental}} agreements are often suspected to promote <b>collusive</b> <b>practices</b> between participating firms. The paper addresses the antitrust implications of Germany’s voluntary Dual Management System for Packaging Waste Collection and Recycling (DSD). It uses analytical {{tools of the}} economic theory of the firm to examine features of DSD’s governance structure that were often identified to impede competition. While the paper does not argue that DSD performs as efficiently as a hypothetical solution in a more competitive setting, it shows that these features have an economic rationale {{from the viewpoint of}} the theory of the firm. The general conclusion is {{that it is necessary to}} carefully analyze the institutional fine-tuning of a voluntary agreement in order to derive the overall impact stemming from a formal lack of competition. A more case-to-case-oriented, institutional research approach could therefore fruitfully supplement model-driven, theoretical analyses of voluntary {{environmental agreements}} and their effect on market competition.

40|$|The {{international}} community has been increasing investment in projects that promote trade facilitation and improve logistics in the developing world, including in ports. In Africa, a key motivation for such projects has been a presumption that poor infrastructure and inefficient border control agencies are the major causes of extended delays in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) ports. Based on new data and analysis, this note argues that collusion between controlling agencies, port authorities, private terminal operators, logistics operators, and large shippers {{is an important part}} of the problem. Decreasing dwell times in ports requires governments to combat <b>collusive</b> <b>practices</b> between the private sector and public authorities and recognize that large-scale investments in infrastructure are not sufficient to reduce logistics delays. Infrastructure gaps and high transport costs are critical factors hindering growth and poverty reduction in SSA. Efficient, lowcost transport systems are prerequisites for African countries to become competitive in the global market.

40|$|Introduction. ] Both the EU and the US {{have laws}} and rules {{intended}} to promote competition by discouraging monopolies and {{both sets of}} rules have similar "anti-trust" character. In {{the case of the}} EU, Community law contains general antitrust provisions, provisions for the control of mergers and concentrations, provisions restricting State aids, and particular rules applying to public undertakings. American antitrust law covers similar ground with respect to competition, monopolies, mergers, <b>collusive</b> <b>practices,</b> price discrimination and exclusionary practices. However, American law says nothing about state aids or about preemptive control of subsidies by any level of government. The law's silence on this topic might seem paradoxical. Since the ideology behind antitrust is so clearly an exaltation of free competition in a market economy, one would expect an explicit and stringent restriction of subsidies in American law, alongside the suspicion of economic concentration that is so apparent. But the very strength of the ideology may itself explain the law's silence: the notion of government subsidy - at least so described - is sufficiently alien that lawmakers have not even paused to consider its prohibition or restriction...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{contribute}} investigating the difficulties {{to reap the}} intended benefits from liberalization and regulatory reforms of network industries. This issue is tackled through the 'theoretical lenses' of new institutional economics, in particular by applying the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework. The study is a comparative analysis of liberalization and regulatory reforms of network industries within the same country context. In Italy, various reforms of network industries have been made and implemented during the 1990 s and 2000 s, especially in water, gas, electricity, telecommunications, railways, highways, local public transports, and urban solid waste. These reforms generally resulted in greater or lesser degrees of changes of regulatory institutions and industry structure, but in relatively modest competitive pressures on the whole. This analysis suggests that the difficulty to implement liberalization and regulatory reforms of network industries in Italy {{may be explained by}} various concurrent mechanisms, which {{have to do with the}} rent-seeking behavior of the actors of the industry's community, the rise of barriers to entry against competitors, and the risk of <b>collusive</b> <b>practices</b> between regulators and regulated.

They provide descriptive statistics on the industry incidence of investigations, the types of behavior investigated, and the frequency with which violations were found and penalties imposed. Although the Commission tried to focus on nontradable sectors, and to target both cartel and abuse-of-dominance cases, the remedies they imposed appear to have been rather ineffective. Moreover, instead of focusing on hard-core anticompetitive behavior, much of the Commission's activity centered on"unfair"trade practices (such as false advertising, trademark infringement, and the behavior of ex-employees of specific enterprises). Many enforcement cases basically dealt with contract enforcement problems. Only a small percentage of cases concerned <b>collusive</b> <b>practices</b> that restricted entry/expansion, such as bid-rigging, price-fixing, and market allocation. And remedies for egregious violations of the law were not dire enough to give firms a strong incentive to abide by the law. Recently proposed amendments to the law should go some way toward allowing the Commission to focus more narrowly on anticompetitive practices, and to strengthen the law's deterrent effect.

40|$|Professional wrestling, {{the enigmatic}} medium of {{entertainment}} enjoyed by millions to this day, was once practiced and distributed {{in a manner}} different from what most modem fans are accustomed to experiencing.

40|$|The social {{significance}} of the insurance antitrust suits extends beyond the specific legal issues of McCarran-Ferguson Act interpretation and the economics of boycotts. Few people have forgotten the extraordinary insurance disruptions of 1985 - 1986. For liability insurance reasons, jails, day care centers, and ski lifts were closed; police patrols were suspended; and playground equipment and diving boards were removed from public schools and parks. For similar reasons, nurse-midwives could not obtain insurance and doctors fled from obstetric specialties. Though perhaps more quietly, producers removed scores of products from markets and product innovation declined. The insurance antitrust suits represent a national trial {{of the source of}} these disruptions. Narrowly, the suits claim that one principal phenomenon of the crisis, the withdrawal of occurrence, pollution, and defense cost insurance coverage, was generated by <b>collusive</b> <b>practices</b> of insurers, rather than by the expansion of tort liability. But the suits 2 ̆ 7 broader social import stems from their implied allegation that the insurance industry possesses a combination of unbridled power and a voracious desire for profits that give it the ability and impetus to engage in massive manipulation of product and service markets, even of such central, yet vulnerable, services as municipal parks, day care, and obstetrics. In this respect, the suits represent the delegation to a jury, not merely of legal issues involving standard insurance forms, but of the broader charges of power, manipulation, and excessive profit making and of issues regarding the role and impact of state insurance regulation. The resolution of the suits may signal the direction of statutory and regulatory policies toward the insurance industry for the decade to come...|$|R
40|$|In this article, I {{explore the}} {{processes}} whereby, {{at the turn}} of the twelfth century, European aristocrats acknowledged clerics'prohibitions of divorce and close-kin marriages. I argue that this normative shift cannot be ad-equately accounted for by the rise of feudalism, the Gregorian reformers' moralist offensive or the development of canon law: These events do not ex-plain (I) why the Roman hierarchy thought it possible, at a certain moment in time, to impose their normative preferences on reluctant elites; or (2) why aristocrats eventually yielded to demands that undermined their autonomy of choice regarding marriage. I address both problems by-considering two analytically distinct transformative processes. One concerns the symbolic and institutional conditions that allowed Roman prelates to substantiate their normative claims: The Church hierarchy emphasized the sacramental and spiritual significance of the marital tie and implemented reforms intended to preclude <b>collusive</b> <b>practices</b> between lords and bishops. The second process highlights how canonical rules of marriage were converted into effective nor-mative constraints: In a context marked by the patrimonialization of feudal relations and an increase in competition, aristocrats relied on ecclesiastical standards for their own regulatory and strategic interests.

40|$|The recent Great Recession has shaken the nation’s {{faith in}} {{free markets and}} {{inspired}} various forms of actual or proposed regulatory intervention displacing free competition. Proponents of such intervention often claim that such interference with free-market outcomes will help foster economic recovery and thus macroeconomic stability by, for instance, enhancing the “purchasing power” of workers or reducing consumer prices. Such arguments for increased economic centralization echo those made during the Great Depression, when proponents of regulatory intervention claimed that such interference with economic liberty and free competition, including suspension of the antitrust laws, was necessary to foster economic recovery. Indeed, this view has even left its mark on constitutional law, with several modern Supreme Court justices claiming that protection for economic liberty and free competition deepened and prolonged the Depression, thereby justifying judicial repudiation of liberty of contract and requiring an expansive reading of Congress’s Commerce power. Using the Great Depression as a case study, the Article examines the link between free competition—and generally applicable regulation that ensures such competition—and macroeconomic stability. The {{results of this study}} shed important light on claims that protection for economic liberty and free competition exacerbated the Depression as well as modern arguments that coercive interference with free-market outcomes can speed the ongoing recovery from the recent Great Recession. Many equate “competition policy” with antitrust law. However, this Article widens the focus beyond antitrust. This wider focus reveals that, at least before the Depression, there were two other important sources of competition policy. Thus, while antitrust regulation, particularly the Sherman Act, protected free competition from undue private restraint, the Dormant Commerce Clause and Due Process Clauses prohibited undue state and federal restraints on economic liberty and thus free competition. As of 1929, then, these three sources of law combined to create and enforce a unified and doctrinally symbiotic commitment to free competition as the norm governing American economic life. Unfortunately, relaxation of antitrust’s anti-collusion standards in the late 1920 s and early 1930 s {{paved the way for the}} 1933 National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA), FDR’s stimulus plan. In particular, the NIRA fostered collective wage and price setting and banned forms of normal competition, thereby protecting incumbent firms from more efficient rivals. Antitrust’s surprising embrace of <b>collusive</b> <b>practices</b> also presaged judicial repudiation of due process protection for economic liberty in Nebbia v. New York, 291 U. S. 502 (1934), repudiation which the Supreme Court confirmed in the late 1930 s. While the Court unanimously overturned the NIRA in Schechter Poultry v. United States, 295 U. S. 495 (1935) Congress and many states, apparently emboldened by Nebbia, responded by enacting various statutes interfering with free competition, some of which survive to this day. In particular, the 1935 National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) mandated collective bargaining with labor cartels known as unions, thereby displacing free competition in wage setting, while the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act further displaced such competition by imposing minimum wages. Shortly thereafter, the Supreme Court invoked Nebbia-like reasoning when holding that neither the antitrust laws nor the dormant Commerce Clause prevents states from organizing and enforcing cartels that would otherwise unreasonably restrain interstate commerce and thus violate the Sherman Act. See Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341 (1943). This “state action” exemption applied, the Court said, even though California producers exported nearly all their raisins to other states. As a result, the rest of the nation bore the brunt of such collusive output reduction. By the mid- 1940 s the pre-Depression commitment to free-market competition was a thing of the past. While the antitrust laws still banned private restraints interfering with free competition, states and the federal government were entirely free to displace free-market outcomes by statute, or for that matter, exempt private conduct from antitrust regulation. While proponents advocated the NIRA and other coercive interference with free markets as recovery measures, both theory and empirical evidence establish that these policies, including cartelization of labor via collective bargaining mandated by the NLRA, in fact deepened and lengthened the Depression. If history is any guide, then, free competition did not cause the recent Great Recession and displacing free competition will only slow recovery. This paper ends by sketching various lessons from the New Deal experience and advocating a return to the pre-Depression commitment to free-market competition. While important, antitrust regulation of private markets cannot ensure the primacy of such competition if states and the national government are left free to exempt large sectors from such regulation and impose price and output restrictions that would be felonies if imposed by private parties. Restoration of free competition as the national norm requires a new symbiosis, whereby state and federal efforts to displace market outcomes are tested by the same skepticism as similar efforts by private parties. Antitrust experts can assist in developing this new symbiosis by devoting more intellectual energy to expanding the domain of antitrust by, for instance, advocating the elimination of various exemptions, particularly Parker’s state action exemption that currently shelters state-created cartels from the Sherman Act. This is not to say that competition should be completely unrestrained by private contract or regulation. Even before the New Deal, courts properly upheld numerous examples of police power regulation that interfered with contractual liberty while counteracting market failure by combating externalities and monopoly pricing. Contractual restrictions on freedom of action, even those that appear “exclusionary,” can have similar beneficial effects, furthering free competition and enhancing economic welfare. Like other proposals to interfere with free competition, recent calls for antitrust to ban certain wealth creating restraints simply because they reduce short run rivalry and raise prices in a particular market are therefore misguided...|$|R
