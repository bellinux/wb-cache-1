Until 2000, the Northwestern United States produced up to 17percent of the world's aluminum and 40percent of the aluminum produced in the United States. The <b>commoditization</b> of power in the early 21st century, coupled with drought that reduced the generation capacity of the river, damaged the industry and by 2001, Columbia River aluminum producers had idled 80percent of its production capacity. By 2003, the entire United States produced only 15percent of the world's aluminum, and many smelters along the Columbia had gone dormant or out of business.|$|E

500|$|LaborintusII is a {{recording}} of the 1965 composition {{of the same name}} by Luciano Berio, who wrote it for the 700thanniversary of Dante Alighieri's birth. The libretto was provided by Edoardo Sanguineti, who included elements of his 1956 poem Laborintus in it. AllMusic's Thom Jurek described the original poem as speaking of [...] "the timelessness of love and mourning, while acting as a critique of the <b>commoditization</b> of all things". In addition to Sanguineti's own poetry—itself based on themes found in Dante's Divina Commedia, Convivio and La Vita Nuova—the work uses excerpts from the Bible and the writings of poets T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. Musically, LaborintusII incorporates elements of jazz and electronic music while sometimes evoking the style of Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi.|$|E
2500|$|Postmodernity is a {{condition}} or a state of being associated with changes to institutions and creations (Giddens, 1990) and with social and political results and innovations, globally but especially in the West since the 1950s, whereas postmodernism is an aesthetic, literary, political or social philosophy, the [...] "cultural and intellectual phenomenon", especially since the 1920s' new movements in the arts. Both of these terms are used by philosophers, social scientists and social critics to refer to aspects of contemporary culture, economics and society that {{are the result of}} features of late 20th century and early 21st century life, including the fragmentation of authority and the <b>commoditization</b> of knowledge (see [...] "Modernity").|$|E
2500|$|Freeganism's initial {{practitioners}} and forerunners like Food Not Bombs were explicitly anti-capitalist, arguing that capitalism {{is responsible for}} excessive consumption, the abuse of human laborers and non-human animals, and the waste of resources. Freegans' approach to anti-capitalism is broadly anarchist in orientation: rather than seeking to seize state power, freegans claim {{to be engaged in}} [...] "prefigurative politics", using wasted resources to build a new society [...] "in the shell of the old" [...] based on values of [...] "community, generosity, social concern, freedom, cooperation, and sharing." [...] Freegan practices in theory reject the <b>commoditization</b> of basic necessities, the imperative of economic growth, and an economy based on money exchange rather than free gifting or sharing. Freegan organizations also often use consensus-based decision-making, popularized by the anti-globalization movement and later visible in anarchist-inspired mobilizations like Occupy Wall Street.|$|E
2500|$|Ellis drops {{names in}} Glamorama {{so often that}} Entertainment Weekly {{describes}} [...] "Nary a sentence... escapes without a cameo from someone famous, quasi-famous, or formerly famous. In fact, in some sentences, Ellis cuts out those pesky nouns and verbs and simply lists celebrities." [...] Namedropping and <b>commoditization</b> have a depersonalizing effect (a world reduced to [...] "sheen and brands"); as the reviewer for The Harvard Crimson observes, [...] "When Victor undergoes a transformation to a law student, we know he is different because he now wears a Brooks Brothers suit and drinks Diet Coke. London and Paris become {{nothing more than a}} different collection of recognizable proper nouns (Notting Hill and Irvine Welsh in the first case; Chez Georges and Yves Saint Laurent in the second)." [...] A writer for the New York Times observes [...] "much of his prose consists of (intentionally) numbingly long lists of his characters' clothes and accouterments... out of which his loft-dwellers somewhat hopefully attempt to assemble something like an identity". In speech, his writing demonstrates the ways in which his characters, too, have internalized the language of consumerist advertising and marketing. According to the Lakeland Ledger, Glamorama is something of a Through the Looking-Glass allegory and a cautionary tale navigating the perils of dissolving identity.|$|E
2500|$|Intel {{had tried}} unsuccessfully to push Apple to migrate the Macintosh {{platform}} to Intel chips. Apple concluded that Intel's CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architecture ultimately {{would not be able}} to compete against RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processors. While the Motorola 68040 [...] offered the same features as the Intel 80486 and could on a clock-for-clock basis significantly outperform the Intel chip, the 486 had the ability to be clocked significantly faster without suffering from overheating problems, especially the clock-doubled i486DX2 which ran the CPU logic at twice the external bus speed, giving such equipped IBM compatible systems a significant performance lead over their Macintosh equivalents. Apple's product design and engineering did not help matters as they restricted the use of the '040 to their expensive Quadras for a time while the 486 was readily available to OEMs as well as enthusiasts who put together their own machines. In late 1991, as the higher-end Macintosh desktop lineup transitioned to the '040, Apple was unable to offer the '040 in their top-of-the-line PowerBooks until early 1994 with the PowerBook 500 series, several years after the first 486-powered IBM compatible laptops hit the market which cost Apple considerable sales. In 1993 Intel rolled out the Pentium processors as the successor to the 486, while the Motorola 68050 was never released, leaving the Macintosh platform a generation behind IBM compatibles in the latest CPU technology. In 1994, Apple abandoned Motorola CPUs for the RISC PowerPC architecture developed by the AIM alliance of Apple Computer, IBM, and Motorola. The Power Macintosh line, the first to use the new chips, proved to be highly successful, with over a million PowerPC units sold in nine months. However, in the long run, spurning Intel for the PowerPC was a mistake as the <b>commoditization</b> of Intel-architecture chips meant Apple couldn't compete on price against [...] "the Dells of the world".|$|E
5000|$|In his {{discussion}} of <b>commoditization,</b> he also presents the idea of singularization which occurs because [...] "there {{are things that are}} publicly precluded from being commoditized…are sometimes extended to things that are normally commodities—in effect, commodities are singularized by being pulled out of their commodity sphere." [...] Kopytoff goes on to describe ways in which commodities can be singularized, for example, through restricted <b>commoditization,</b> sacralization, and terminal <b>commoditization.</b> While singularization and commodity pathway diversion have stark similarities, and Kopytoff's singularization categories can be seen in Appadurai's description of types of commodity pathway diversions, Appadurai critiques placing singularization and <b>commoditization</b> in direct opposition because, as he argues, diversion (singularization) and <b>commoditization</b> are fluidly occupied positions in the use life of an object.|$|E

50|$|<b>Commoditization</b> {{of emotion}} theory {{focuses on the}} effects of marketized care work on the care workers’ {{personal}} experiences and individual well-being. The <b>commoditization</b> of emotion theory asserts that many jobs in the new service economy require workers to act emotions they do not really feel and that this process is harmful to workers. For example, the <b>commoditization</b> of childcare may be overly emotionally exhausting on childcare workers due to the conflict between the natural emotions of this job and these workers’ need for pay. Arlie Russell Hochschild explores this theory in The Managed Heart.|$|E

5000|$|In The Cultural Biography of Things: <b>Commoditization</b> as a Process, Igor Kopytoff argues that, while {{commodities}} {{are often}} thought of in Marxian terms as things which are produced and then exist, in fact, [...] "commoditization is best looked upon {{as a process of}} becoming rather than as an all-or-none state of being." [...] He conceptualizes <b>commoditization</b> as a process which is both cultural and cognitive: ...|$|E
5000|$|These two {{concepts}} are fundamentally different {{and the business}} community more commonly uses <b>commoditization</b> to describe {{the transformation of the}} market to undifferentiated products through increased competition, typically resulting in decreasing prices. While in economic terms, <b>commoditization</b> is closely related to and often follows from the stage when a market changes from one of monopolistic competition to one of perfect competition, a product essentially becomes a commodity when customers perceive little or no value difference between brands or versions.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} food {{security}} and dietary diversity, which {{are defined as}} reliable access to a caloric sufficiency and access {{to a wide variety}} of macro and micro nutrients in order to maintain nutritive balance, respectively, the <b>commoditization</b> of food plays a key role in diminishing the control local populations have over their own subsistence production. Delocalization of food systems, which Pelto and Pelto define as taking production of food out of a local subsistence context and tying it to geographically broader market systems, can precipitate marked cultural and nutritional disruption. Likewise <b>commoditization</b> of food systems, defined as a paradigm shift from one of subsistence or social significances shift toward one which treats food primarily as a market commodity, can affect dietary health as well as collective identity. <b>Commoditization</b> tends to shift food security and dietary diversity away from integrated kinship or other reciprocal distribution networks toward being an issue of who can best compete in a free market to achieve these ends; indeed, <b>commoditization</b> has often been linked to breakdowns in food entitlements, which are defined as cultural or social norms that ensure food access for all members of a given social group.|$|E

5000|$|In {{business}} literature, <b>commoditization</b> {{is defined}} as the process by which goods that have economic value and are distinguishable in terms of attributes (uniqueness or brand) end up becoming simple commodities {{in the eyes of the}} market or consumers. It is the movement of a market from differentiated to undifferentiated price competition and from monopolistic to perfect competition. Hence, the key effect of <b>commoditization</b> is that the pricing power of the manufacturer or brand owner is weakened: when products become more similar from a buyer's point of view, they will tend to buy the cheapest.|$|E
