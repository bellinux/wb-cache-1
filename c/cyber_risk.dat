40|$|Today’s {{increasing}} connectivity creates <b>cyber</b> <b>risks</b> at personal, organizational up to societal level. Societal <b>cyber</b> <b>risks</b> require mitigation by {{all kinds}} of actors where government should take the lead due to its responsibility to protect its citizens. Since no formal global governance exists, the governmental responsibility should start {{at the national level}} of every country. To achieve successful management of global <b>cyber</b> <b>risks,</b> appropriate alignment between these sovereignly developed strategies is required, which concerns a complex challenge. To create alignment, getting insight into differences between national cyber strategies, is the first step. This, in turn, requires an appropriate analysis approach that helps to identify the key differences. In this article, we introduce such an analysis approach based on social contract theory. The resulting analysis model consists of both a direct and an indirect type of social cyber contract between governments, citizens and corporations, within and between sovereign nations. To show its effectiveness, the proposed social cyber contract model is validated through an illustrated case examining various constitutional rights to privacy, their embedding in the national cyber strategies and how their differences could cause potential barriers for alignment across sovereignties.

As part of an on-going effort to develop a holistic, predictive <b>cyber</b> security <b>risk</b> assessment model, the characterization of human factors, which includes human behavior, is needed {{to understand how the}} actions of users, defenders, and attackers affect <b>cyber</b> security <b>risk.</b> The work group developing this new <b>cyber</b> security <b>risk</b> assessment model and framework has chosen to distinguish between trust and confidence by using “trust” only for human factors, and “confidence” for all non-human factors (e. g. hardware and software) in order to reduce confusion between the two concepts within our model. We have developed an initial framework for how to incorporate trust as a factor/parameter within a larger characterization of the human influences (users, defenders and attackers) on <b>cyber</b> security <b>risk.</b> Trust in the human factors is composed of two main categories: inherent characteristics, that which {{is a part of the}} individual, and situational characteristics, that which is outside of the individual.
