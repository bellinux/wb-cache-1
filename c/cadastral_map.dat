Missionaries returned in 1890 and, although they immediately expanded the church building, {{it was still}} not {{large enough to accommodate}} all those who wished to attend. Thanks to subsidies by the bishop, Magloire-Désiré Barthet, and to donations by the parishioners, a new church was built and inaugurated on the Catholic feast day of Saint Anne in 1897. The mission also obtained two adjacent properties, lot #73 on the <b>cadastral</b> <b>map.</b> By the following year, the Christian community had performed 1,100 baptisms, as well as many catechumen.|$|E

40|$|The base <b>cadastral</b> <b>maps</b> {{have been}} {{produced}} on the 30 Universal Transform Mercator (UTM) systems in Turkey {{since the middle of}} 1990 ’s. The base <b>cadastral</b> <b>maps</b> produced on the nation-wide coordinate system covering only % 5 percent of Turkey cadastre. In Turkey, cadastral surveys have been completed up to % 98 in cities with different survey methods and coordinate systems. Because of this, the current base <b>cadastral</b> <b>maps</b> could not be produced according to today’s standards in Turkey. Thus, current base <b>cadastral</b> <b>maps</b> can be in digital form on the UTM system for modern cadastre. In order to carry out this, the authority determined three important stages for modern cadastre.

40|$|Unmanned aerial {{vehicles}} (UAVs) {{provide a}} flexible and low-cost {{solution for the}} acquisition of high-resolution data. The potential of high-resolution UAV imagery to create and update <b>cadastral</b> <b>maps</b> is being increasingly investigated. Existing procedures generally involve substantial fieldwork and many manual processes. Arguably, multiple parts of UAV-based <b>cadastral</b> <b>mapping</b> workflows could be automated. Specifically, as many cadastral boundaries coincide with visible boundaries, they could be extracted automatically using image analysis methods. This study investigates the transferability of gPb contour detection, a state-of-the-art computer vision method, to remotely sensed UAV images and UAV-based <b>cadastral</b> <b>mapping.</b> Results show that the approach is transferable to UAV data and automated cadastral mapping: object contours are comprehensively detected at completeness and correctness rates of up to 80 %. The detection quality is optimal when the entire scene is covered with one orthoimage, due to the global optimization of gPb contour detection. However, a balance between high completeness and correctness is hard to achieve, so a combination with area-based segmentation and further object knowledge is proposed. The localization quality exhibits the usual dependency on ground resolution. The approach {{has the potential to}} accelerate the process of general boundary delineation during the creation and updating of <b>cadastral</b> <b>maps...</b>|$|R

40|$|Preparation of {{a series}} of <b>cadastral</b> <b>maps</b> and {{distribution}} of the land ownership certificates to each landowner of the whole kingdom of Nepal has been completed recently. However, half of the <b>cadastral</b> <b>mapping</b> of the country was carried out without the national coordinate system references and attention has given to map the private cultivated land, public land and government land with settlements during the <b>cadastral</b> surveying and <b>mapping</b> of the country. During the <b>cadastral</b> <b>mapping</b> of the country, it was realized that a national system of geodetic network of different order of ground control is required to prepare the large-scale map of the whole of the kingdom of Nepal. Everest spheroid 1830 and UTM (modified with three degree zone) projection system was selected for the geodetic reference and the higher order and lower order geodetic control networks was established with the traditional geodetic survey equipment i. e., theodolite and distance meter. This paper describes the observation procedure and the adjustment results with the accuracy standard of the geodetic control network of Nepal established in different time using different types of equipment and techniques. Attempt has been made to give some idea on the use of Global Positioning System GPS control network extension for the production of large-scale cadastral plan of the country.
