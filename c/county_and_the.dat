5|$|Since the {{counties}} were re-established in 1992, Croatia {{is divided into}} 20 <b>counties</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> capital city of Zagreb, the latter having <b>the</b> authority <b>and</b> legal status of a <b>county</b> <b>and</b> a city at the same time. Borders of {{the counties}} changed in some instances since, with the latest revision taking place in 2006. The counties subdivide into 127 cities and 429 municipalities.

NUTS 1 level places the entire country in a single unit, while there are three NUTS 2 regions. Those are Northwest Croatia, Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia <b>and</b> Adriatic Croatia. <b>The</b> latter encompasses all the counties along the Adriatic coast. The Northwest Croatia includes the city of Zagreb, Zagreb, Krapina-Zagorje, Varaždin, Koprivnica-Križevci <b>and</b> Međimurje <b>counties,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Central <b>and</b> Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia includes the remaining areas—Bjelovar-Bilogora, Virovitica-Podravina, Požega-Slavonia, Brod-Posavina, Osijek-Baranja, Vukovar-Syrmia, Karlovac <b>and</b> Sisak-Moslavina <b>counties.</b> Individual <b>counties</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> city of Zagreb also represent NUTS 3 level subdivision units in Croatia. The NUTS Local administrative unit divisions are two-tiered.
