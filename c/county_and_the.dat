5|$|Since the {{counties}} were re-established in 1992, Croatia {{is divided into}} 20 <b>counties</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> capital city of Zagreb, the latter having <b>the</b> authority <b>and</b> legal status of a <b>county</b> <b>and</b> a city at the same time.

Those are Northwest Croatia, Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia <b>and</b> Adriatic Croatia. <b>The</b> latter encompasses all the counties along the Adriatic coast. The Northwest Croatia includes the city of Zagreb, Zagreb, Krapina-Zagorje, VaraÅ¾din, Koprivnica-KriÅ¾evci <b>and</b> MeÄ‘imurje <b>counties,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Central <b>and</b> Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia includes the remaining areasâ€”Bjelovar-Bilogora, Virovitica-Podravina, PoÅ¾ega-Slavonia, Brod-Posavina, Osijek-Baranja, Vukovar-Syrmia, Karlovac <b>and</b> Sisak-Moslavina <b>counties.</b> Individual <b>counties</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> city of Zagreb also represent NUTS 3 level subdivision units in Croatia.
