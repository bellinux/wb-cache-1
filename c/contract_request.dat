50|$|About this time, General Dynamics {{made the}} {{decision}} not to compete in the tests mandated by Congress, because of the Army's demand for a fixed price contract on any future Viper production lots that were to include safety improvements. This meant that after the Army had spent over $250 million on a M72 LAW replacement since 1975, the Viper program was at an end. With General Dynamics's decision to refuse a fixed price <b>contract</b> <b>request,</b> the Army announced in September 1983 that it was canceling all contracts for the FGR-17 Viper. Two months later, the testing mandated by Congress found the Swedish designed AT4 the most suitable off-the-shelf option to replace the M72 LAW.

40|$|This paper, {{written in}} German language, deals with public {{procurement}} {{policies in the}} European Union in an overall economic context. Public sector contracts {{for goods and services}} make up about one sixth of Community GDP. Governments of all levels tend to rely on local firms when extenting delivery contracts. This may be in conflict with the rules of the EU internal market which, for larger <b>contracts,</b> <b>request</b> competition among bidders. The current essay discusses the possible tensions between competition in the market and the regulation of public procurement. Public contracts have been used to implement additional policy goals, such as social and environmental aspects or to aid small business. The latter goal is often blurred by the tendency to centralise procurement in order to increase the market power of public demand. In general, such a mix of goals may reduce the efficiency of procurement policy. public procurement, EU internal market, public demand and competition...|$|R
