I can sleep on that heartbreaking husk {{mattress}} with Ingua, but I'll be skinned if I eat your salt junk and <b>corn</b> <b>pone.</b> Forewarned is forearmed; I brought my own grub." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{the last}} crisp slice of bacon was gone, {{and the last}} {{allowance}} of <b>corn</b> <b>pone</b> devoured, the boys stretched themselves out on the grass, filled with contentment. They could have found a cooler place, but they would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting camp-fire.|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} between johnnycake and hoecake originally {{lay in the}} method of preparation, though today both are often cooked on a griddle or in a skillet. Some recipes call for baking johnnycakes in an oven, similar to <b>corn</b> <b>pones,</b> which are still baked in the oven as they were traditionally.|$|R

5000|$|Native Americans {{had been}} using ground corn (maize) for food {{thousands}} of years before European explorers arrived in the New World.European settlers, especially those who resided in the English Southern Colonies, learned the original recipes and processes for corn dishes from the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Creek, and soon they devised recipes for using cornmeal in breads similar to those made of grains available in Europe. Cornbread {{has been called a}} [...] "cornerstone" [...] of the Cuisine of the Southern United States. Cornmeal is produced by grinding dry raw corn grains. A coarser meal (compare flour) made from corn is grits. Grits are produced by soaking raw corn grains in hot water containing calcium hydroxide (an alkaline salt), which loosens the grain hulls (bran) and increases the nutritional value of the product (by increasing available niacin and available amino acids). These are separated by washing and flotation in water, and the now softened slightly swelled grains are called hominy. Hominy, posole in Spanish, also is ground into masa harina for tamales and tortillas. This ancient Native American technology has been named nixtamalization. Besides cornbread, Native Americans used corn to make numerous other dishes from the familiar hominy grits to alcoholic beverages (such as Andean chicha). Cornbread was popular during the American Civil War because it was very cheap and could be made in many different forms—high-rising, fluffy loaves or simply fried (as unleavened <b>pone,</b> <b>corn</b> fritters, hoecakes, etc.) ...|$|R

Never mind, Ruth; you won't starve much longer, nor wear moccasins either.' The woman threw off her gloom at this, and in her eyes welled up a great love for her white lord--the first white man she had ever seen--the first man whom she had known to treat a woman as {{something}} better than a mere animal or beast of burden.|$|E
60|$|The {{letter was}} long for Clarence, and written under great {{difficulties}} from date to date. For {{nearly a month}} he had tramped over mountains and across river bottoms, waiting for news of an organized force of resistance in Missouri. Begging his way from cabin to cabin, and living on greasy bacon and <b>corn</b> <b>pone,</b> at length he crossed the swift Gasconade (so named by the French settlers because of its brawling ways) where {{the bridge of the}} Pacific railroad had been blown up by the Governor's orders. Then he learned that the untiring Lyon had steamed up the Missouri and had taken possession of Jefferson City without a blow, and that the ragged rebel force had fought and lost at Booneville. Footsore, but undaunted, he pushed on to join the army, which he heard was retreating southward along the western tier of counties of the state.|$|E
60|$|All {{the night}} the smoke-pipes were batting against the boughs of oak and cottonwood, and {{snapping}} the trailing vines. Some other regiments went by another route. The ironclads, followed in hot haste by General Sherman in a navy tug, had gone ahead, and were even then shoving with their noses great trunks of trees in their eagerness to get behind the Rebels. The Missouri regiment spread out along the waters, and were soon waist deep, hewing a path for the heavier transports to come. Presently the General came back to a plantation half under water, where Black Bayou joins Deer Creek, to hurry the work in cleaning out that Bayou. The light transports meanwhile were bringing up more troops from a second detachment. All through the Friday the navy great guns were heard booming in the distance, growing quicker and quicker, until the quivering air shook the hanging things in that vast jungle. Saws stopped, and axes were poised over shoulders, and many times that day the General lifted his head anxiously. As {{he sat down in}} the evening in a slave cabin redolent with <b>corn</b> <b>pone</b> and bacon, the sound still hovered among the trees and rolled along the still waters.|$|E
5000|$|Early in U.S. history, American pioneers {{consumed}} largely cornmeal-based breakfasts. [...] Common breakfast products included <b>corn</b> <b>pone,</b> Johnnycakes, ashcakes, hoe-cakes, {{and corn}} dodgers. [...] Ashcakes consisted of cornmeal wrapped in cabbage leaves cooked in {{the ashes of}} a campfire, while <b>corn</b> <b>pone,</b> corn dodgers, and hoe-cakes differed only in baking methods.|$|E

50|$|Though it {{was usually}} served with the water cooked out, {{in the form of}} hash, {{sometimes}} it was served as a stew, with flour as a substitute for the cornmeal. When <b>corn</b> <b>pone</b> went sour, it was often used in place of cornmeal.|$|E
50|$|Mămăligă {{is often}} served {{with sour cream}} and cheese on the side (mămăligă cu brânză şi smântână) or crushed {{in a bowl of}} hot milk (mămăligă cu lapte). Sometimes slices of mămăligă are pan-fried in oil or in lard, the result being a sort of <b>corn</b> <b>pone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Texas has {{traditional}} Southern meals such as pan-fried chicken, field peas (such as black-eyed peas), greens (such as collard greens, mustard greens, turnip greens, or poke salad), mashed potatoes, cornbread or <b>corn</b> <b>pone,</b> sweet tea, and dessert—typically a pie (sweet potato, chess, shoofly, pecan, and peach are {{the most}} common), or a cobbler.|$|E

5000|$|Siebert {{credited}} Powhatan {{with being}} the source of more English loans than any other indigenous language. Most such words were likely borrowed very early, probably before Powhatan—English conflict arose in 1622. Among these words are: chinquapin (Castanea pumila), [...] (as in chumming), hickory, hominy, matchcoat, [...] moccasin, [...] muskrat, [...] opossum, [...] persimmon, pokeweed, pone (as in <b>corn</b> <b>pone),</b> raccoon, [...] terrapin, [...] , [...] and wicopy.|$|E
5000|$|... "It is a fallacy, long disproved, that Negro cooks, chefs, caterers and homemakers {{can adapt}} {{themselves}} {{only to the}} standard Southern dishes, such as fried chicken, greens, <b>corn</b> <b>pone</b> and hot breads. Like other Americans living in various sections of the country they have naturally shown a desire to become versatile {{in the preparation of}} any dish, whether it is Spanish, Italian, French, Balinese or East Indian in origin." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Corn</b> <b>pone</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to as [...] "Indian pone") {{is a type of}} cornbread made from a thick, malleable cornmeal dough (which is usually egg-less and milk-less) and cooked in a specific type of iron pan over an open fire (such as a frontiersman would use), using butter, margarine, shortening, or cooking oil. Corn pones have been a staple of Southern U.S. cuisine, and have been discussed by many American writers, including Mark Twain.|$|E
5000|$|The {{show was}} {{inspired}} by Rowan & Martins Laugh-In, the major difference being that Hee Haw was far less topical, and was centered on country music and rural culture. Hosted by country music artists Buck Owens and Roy Clark {{for most of its}} run, the show was equally well known for its voluptuous, scantily clad women in stereotypical farmers daughter outfits and country-style minidresses (a group that {{came to be known as}} the [...] "Hee Haw Honeys"), and its <b>corn</b> <b>pone</b> humor.|$|E

Cindy Bear unsuccessfully tries to woo Yogi. After Ranger Smith thwarts Yogi's latest attempts to grab some food, Yogi gets angry and convinces Ranger to transfer him out of Jellystone National Park. Smith prepares Yogi to be sent over to the San Diego Zoo along with an identification tag. Yogi first says goodbye to everything, but tricks another bear named <b>Corn</b> <b>Pone</b> into going to California instead of him and Boo-Boo and Cindy remain unaware of this, thinking Yogi departed for good.|$|E
50|$|The gravy for {{biscuits}} and gravy is typically sausage or sawmill, not the red-eye gravy (made with coffee) {{used in the}} lowland South. Pork drippings from frying sausage, bacon, {{and other types of}} pan-fried pork are collected and saved, used for making gravy and in greasing cast-iron cookware. (Note that Appalachia is overwhelmingly Protestant, the Catholic prohibition on meat-eating during Lent had no impact on Appalachian cuisine.) Chicken and dumplings and fried chicken remain much-loved dishes. Cornbread, <b>corn</b> <b>pone,</b> hominy grits, mush, cornbread pudding and hominy stew are also quite common foods, as corn is the primary grain grown in the Appalachian hills and mountains, but are less common than in the past.|$|E
5000|$|Burns {{is taken}} to the Fulton County prison camp. It is a foul place {{consisting}} of wooden shacks, stocks, sweatboxes, and pure filth. He has iron chains attached to his legs and meets the warden, Harold Hardy, a fat, angry, and spiteful man of Irish descent who hates people from the North. Hardy calls him a [...] "Yankee" [...] and tells him to feel guilty and get used to chain gang life {{to make it easier}} on himself. He has one of his guards, Mr. Trump, escort Burns to his quarters. Burns is introduced to a foul shack of filthy, exhausted men and meets an elderly prisoner, Pappy Glue who laughs at him when he says he didn't commit the crime he was imprisioned for. He is introduced to an inedible meal of pig fat, bitter <b>corn</b> <b>pone,</b> and sorghum molasses and gags trying to eat it and gives his plate to a veteran prisoner enjoying and devouring it.|$|E
5000|$|Bobby Baker, top {{political}} aide to Lyndon Johnson when the Texas Senator became Kennedy's vice presidential running-mate, recalled that Lytton gave an astonishing $200,000 in cash to Kennedy {{a month before}} the election, probably the largest cash contribution from any individual of the Democratic campaign. All that Lytton asked in return was the prestige of traveling with the candidates, {{and in the case of}} Johnson, a Lytton aide even proposed the ideal circumstances: A [...] "whistle-stop" [...] train trip through the South. Baker immediately latched on to the idea and it soon became a reality. Johnson would travel through eight Southern States in early October, with loudspeakers attached to his train blaring out [...] "The Yellow Rose of Texas". The journey of what reporters laughingly called [...] "The <b>Corn</b> <b>Pone</b> Special" [...] won much popular southern support for the Democrats and was widely credited, by both Baker and later historians, with winning the election for Kennedy.|$|E
