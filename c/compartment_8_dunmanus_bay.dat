5000|$|The {{boundary}} between the baronies of Bantry and Carbery coincided with those of Clann Taidhg Ruaidh and McCarthy's lands. The parts in Durrus Barony reaching {{from the site of}} Bantry Abbey along the bay to Rooska, was in the territory of O'Sullivans of Bantry. Clann Taidhg Ruaidh had no direct access to Bantry Bay, as the only townland touching it in both Carbery, Bantry and Durrus Parish was Killoveenogue. This was the property of Philip O'Sullivan in 1641. The territory of Clann Tadgh Ruaidh did not extend to the South side of Durrus Parish of Four Mile Water River. Here were the townlands of Coolcoulaghta, formerly Coorcoulaghta, Dromreagh, and Ballycommane. The first two formed part of the Taidhg O'Mahony lands, and the Earl of Cork acquired Dromreagh prior to 1641. Ballycommane was part of the lands of the Clann Diarmada (McCarthy of Cloghane) which were confiscated after the attainder of Domnall MacCormaic, and was acquired by Sir Cormac Mac Tadgh of Blarney, who later mortgaged it to Sir Walter Coppinger. The Clann Tadgh Ruaidh occupied the remainder of the old Durrus Parish, as far as the borders of the Kilcrohane Parish, which was the territory of the O'Dalys. From around the seventeenth century, the main focus of the area had shifted from Scart on the present Cork-Bantry Road and the <b>Dunmanus</b> <b>Bay</b> area, to the head of <b>Dunmanus</b> <b>Bay.</b> Canon Cahalane, parish priest 1955-1958, of Bantry, believed hat {{there may have been a}} 'lost parish', 'Inis Cuinge' between the present parishes of Durrus and Bantry and that Whiddy Island may have been part of it.

The boatmen were Joe and Mick Flynn of Gearameen Durrus. The Lucey family of Waterville and a French Company operating out of Crookhaven were also in the business. At different stages four or five boats operated. The urchins were picked from the seabed by divers. John Arthur {{said that they would}} often spend four hours in the water. The urchins were sold on the French market live and were shipped through Cork Airport.

5000|$|Dunlough Castle is {{a series}} of three {{fortified}} towers, or keeps, which stand almost invisibly upon the isthmus connecting “Three Castles Head” with the mainland. The only route of access is from the south across private farm land. The towers are connected by a wall spanning more than one hundred feet from the western cliffs to the shores of an apparently man-made lake. The wall is mostly fallen today; yet in places it stands approximately 15 ft. At the eastern shore of the lake, a wall from the same period serves as a dam, preventing the lake's water from pouring over the cliffs into <b>Dunmanus</b> <b>Bay</b> several hundred feet below. Passage around the eastern shore of the lake is awkward; while the castle and wall block the western shore. A small footpath between the westernmost ruins and the 400 ft cliffs allows access to the towers and rocky cliffs beyond.

50|$|Dereenalomane Barytes Mine was {{originally}} {{worked as a}} copper mine Traill and Thomas in 1840, producing 19 tons of copper, before shifting to barium sulphate, a heavy white mineral, (used for paint, papermaking, etc.) Josiah Wedgwood used it for making pottery. Geologist T. D. Triphook, was involved in 1854 when it {{was known as the}} Bandon Barytes Mines. From 1860 the mine was managed by Charles Thomas, a Cornish Mining Captain, followed by George Ellis in the 1870s. From 1820 to 1920 intermittently when 2,500 tons were raised in 1851 compared to only 800 tons in three other centres in the former United Kingdom. The material was washed, dried, crushed and milled. It was packed into bags and sent to an island jetty in <b>Dunmanus</b> <b>Bay</b> by a 1.23 mi aerial ropeway. In 1917 a major fire caused extensive damage including the underground workings. Although repairs were carried out the mine never reached its former output. Mining historian Grenville AJ Cole regarded it as the first in Ireland and one of the earliest in the world.

5000|$|In O'Flanagan and Buttimer's work, Cork History and Society they {{single out}} the insular peninsular world of Schull-Kilcrohane-Beara as showing {{a pattern of}} densely {{populated}} clustered settlements with population densities of South East Asian proportions. This was possible due to complex partnership arrangements in the organisation of land use and work rhythms {{and the use of}} the spade for cultivation due to a surplus of labour. Joint farming was integral and marine resources of seaweed and marine coral sand was extensively used. In <b>Dunmanus</b> <b>Bay</b> this came from Carbery Island among other places. Seasonal migration to the better farmlands of East Cork and Munster also added to income. In South Kilkenny, Amhloaimh O Suilleabhain (Humphrey O'Sullivan) said that a [...] "spailpina bochta" [...] could earn 8d. a day and the sickle men [...] "lucht corain [...] "15d. Added to this widespread sub-division, early marriages, the availability of wasteland, smallpox inoculation and the presence of a cottier textile industry and the contribution of fishing allowed a massive population expansion. Land was let by the 'gneeve' i.e. the grass of one cow or one twelfth of a ploughland. The contribution of the wife by keeping poultry and spinning was important.

40|$|Cycling {{of organic}} carbon in marine sediments is of {{fundamental}} importance for marine ecosystem function, for marine and atmospheric chemistry, for the petroleum {{and natural gas}} industry, and for paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental studies. While most of this carbon is derived from marine and terrestrial sources, significant improvements in mapping and remote investigation have revealed that seabed fluid flow, principally {{in the form of}} thermogenic or microbial methane, is also of fundamental importance. In this thesis, the cycling of organic carbon at a number of sites in Irish waters was conducted, with a focus on recently mapped seabed seepage features. A spatial study of the distribution of lipid biomarkers in surface sediments and water column plankton in the western Irish Sea revealed zonation in diatom, zooplankton and dinoflagellate biomass and detrital input in line with hydrographic zonation and seasonal primary production (Chapter 2). Active gas seepage was recorded from carbonate mounds at the Codling Fault Zone, western Irish Sea as well as extensive eroded nodules, largely covered hard ground pavements, patches of anoxic seabed and extensive fossil tube worms and colonising hydroids. Analysis of retrieved samples has confirmed that these hard grounds are methane-derived authogenic carbonates and that anaerobic oxidation of methane is likely a significant process at this site (Chapter 3). The microbial diversity at a large composite but apparently dormant pockmark in the Malin Sea, NW Ireland was found to be dominated by non-seepage associated microbes and suggests a shift in population structure over a pockmarks lifetime. Bacterial species diversity was low and dominated by Psychrobacter and Sulfitobacter genera, although downcore microdiversity is apparent and could indicate niche specialisation with depth (Chapter 4). A shallow pockmark field in <b>Dunmanus</b> <b>Bay</b> was found to coincide with regions of acoustic gas signatures in the upper 3 m of seabed. This has been confirmed to be gas, which most likely accumulated below fine-grained impermeable muddy sediment. Numerous lines of evidence suggest that gaseous products, including methane, are produced in situ rather than transported from the subsurface, suggesting that the role of microbial activity in pockmark formation in this setting could be underestimated(Chapter 5) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to present an {{analysis}} of the corpus of Harold Frederic's short fiction published between 1876 and 1898. A search of Frederic criticism revealed that little interest had been shown in this short fiction. Few of Frederic's tales had been analyzed or commented upon. In addition, no study considered the entire body of twenty-five stories and novellas. A review of dissertations concerning Frederic's works disclosed that, except for two studies, scholarly attention had been focused entirely upon Frederic's novels. The two studies which included selected short works associated this fiction with Frederic's efforts as a novelist. This study analyzed all of Harold Frederic's published short fiction, identifying themes, literary techniques, and subject matter developed by him. The works were considered chronologically and placed into three groups. Each group spanned approximately six years beginning with 1876. A 'brief summary of each story was given including plot development, major characters, artistic devices and techniques, themes, and characteristics of Frederic's writing. Each group of stories was then summarized, and the short fiction was compared with traditional literary classifications of realism, naturalism, local color, and romanticism. The majority of Frederic's stories was written in a realistic manner. Frederic's descriptions of setting, his dialogue techniques, and his character depictions placed his stories in the tradition of literary naturalism. But his plot development, presenting optimistic points of view, was in the romantic tradition. Hence, Frederic's short fiction was fundamentally in the tradition of literary romanticism. This study revealed Frederic's development as a writer of fiction. His early characters were stereotyped; his later characters were individualized. Early stories concerned landedgentry and other idyllic characters; later tales developed believable and memorable, naive, middle-class characters. This analysis showed that the settings in Frederic's tales became more distinctive. His early tales were set in conventional fictional areas. In the later stories, Frederic created his own characteristic fictional areas of the <b>Dunmanus</b> <b>Bay</b> for his Irish allegories and of Dearborn County in York State for his Mohawk Valley stories. The analysis also revealed that Frederic modified his use of artistic devices. Frederic reduced the span of time in his an evening. Also, he reduced his early, lengthy, descriptive passages, full of alliteration, consonance, and assonance, to carefully detailed descriptions of locales, battles, buildings, characters, and climate in his later work. In addition, Frederic mastered the use of historically accurate details and specific places, which gave believability to his stories. The study showed that, as Frederic developed as a writer of short fiction, his plots became less complicated and that he regularly employed the youthful naive-narrator as a frame for his characteristic frame-story technique. Also, Frederic used humor in his fiction, changing the early humor directed toward a character to the more subtle humor of name imagery and character development. The analysis indicated that Frederic's early tales were simply narratives, but that his later writings developed to include allegorical and symbolic tales concerned with individualism, home rule in Ireland, and the triumph of romance over realism. Other recurrent themes included the triumph of good over evil; the virtues of hard work, truth, innocence, loyalty, faithfulness, and honor; and the vices of vanity, treachery, dishonor, unfaithfulness, avarice, and usury. The analysis showed that, in his short fiction, Frederic developed a set of moral, social, and political standards which were appropriate to his era and to his contemporary reading public. Thesis (D.
