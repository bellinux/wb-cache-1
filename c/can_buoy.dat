50|$|The channel {{over the}} bar and into the harbour changes {{from time to time}} {{although}} the established buoyage system on the channel can usually be relied on to stay constant. A look out should be made for temporary pellet buoys and beacons to show changes in the channel. 175 degrees in from the leading buoy is a large conical buoy Number 1 flashing green and the large red Number 2, <b>can</b> <b>buoy</b> flashing red on the bar itself are both visible in most weather conditions. It is advisable to make good a course between these buoys until the smaller buoys of the channel become visible, after which it is better to favour the starboard side because there is a considerable east going tidal stream across the harbour entrance from approximately two hours before every high water. From the starboard buoy No.9 known as the 'Knock', the channel bends away towards the South East into considerably quieter waters. The wide sweep to the eastward just past the lifeboat house must be made with the red beacons close to port as the channel is quite narrow at this point. On passing the green buoy named the 'Pool', turn to the South West and follow the buoys to the last red <b>can</b> <b>buoy</b> (Number 14) then arc back Easterly close to the marsh edge and follow the red beacons to the Quayside.|$|E

The Atlantic Local Coastal Pilot of 1879 gives detailed instructions for sailing into the Ipswich River and Plum Island Sound from the Atlantic. It advises the captain of a sailing vessel to heave to and send for a pilot, as [...] "The bar {{at the entrance to}} Ipswich Harbor is of shifting sand and changes its position with every heavy gale ...." [...] The channel went, and still goes, between two bars, North Breaker, extending from Sandy Point, and South Breaker, extending from the vicinity of Castle Hill. In 1879 they were marked by buoys and lights. Currently North Breaker is marked by a spar buoy and South Breaker by a <b>can</b> <b>buoy,</b> in addition to the channel buoys.

50|$|The Racine Reef is a {{major hazard}} to {{navigation}} not only for shipping {{in and out of}} Racine harbor, but also for traffic between Milwaukee and Chicago. It has been marked with a succession of aids, starting with a <b>can</b> <b>buoy</b> placed in 1869 after a study of erecting a lighthouse on the reef itself found the expense to be too great. Various shore lights were also added including ranges based on the Racine breakwaters and a red beacon mounted on the Wind Point Light. These measures were found to be ineffective, and in 1898 construction began on a beacon set {{in the center of the}} reef. This acetylene-powered lamp was placed on a masonry platform resting on a wood crib; the light was first lit on August 31, 1899. This arrangement proved quickly to be quite problematic; the light was difficult to service and ever-increasing piles of rip-rap were laid about the platform in attempts to curb erosion and storm damage. In 1901 the beacon's iron tower was also made taller, but the problems continued.|$|E

40|$|A {{foundational}} argument long invoked {{to justify}} stable property rights is that property law must protect settled expectations. Respect for expectations unites otherwise disparate strands of property theory focused on ex ante incentives, individual identity, and community. It also privileges resistance to legal transitions that transgress reliance interests. When changes in law unsettle expectations, such changes {{are thought to}} generate disincentives that Frank Michelman famously labeled 2 ̆ 2 demoralization costs. 2 ̆ 2 Although rarely approached in these terms, arguments for legal certainty reflect underlying psychological assumptions about how people contemplate property rights when choosing whether and how to work, invest, create, bolster identity, join a community, and make other decisions at property 2 ̆ 7 s core. More precisely, demoralization is predicated {{on a kind of}} paralysis flowing from anxieties about instability, unfair singling out, and majoritarian expropriation that can be sparked in legal transitions. This prevailing psychological portrait of expectations has considerable intuitive appeal and is widely influential. It is, however, distinctly incomplete. This Article offers an alternative picture of the expectations with which people approach property and the corresponding anxieties that might cause people to hesitate. From this perspective, stability is less important than assurances that the legal system will respond when external forces threaten to overwhelm the value owners create, that it will provide a fair process of adjustment over time, and that it will ensure inclusion. In short, property law can offer morale benefits that are every bit as critical as demoralization costs. Property theory and doctrine often juxtapose ex ante certainty against ex post flexibility; however a morale lens underscores that legal transitions can signal responsiveness as easily as instability. Doctrinally, this understanding recalibrates property law 2 ̆ 7 s approach to expectation. Normatively, property 2 ̆ 7 s largely ignored, but absolutely vital, morale function provides a framework for understanding how the legal system <b>can</b> <b>buoy</b> confidence in greater balance, fostering all of the work with which property is so rightly associated...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the performance of}} an improved 5 -beam ADCP, with a vertical beam, when deployed to measure non-directional waves in waters of 40 m depth. To assess the performance, the ADCP is compared with four co-located directional wave buoys. The surface elevation spectra {{as measured by the}} vertical beam compare well with estimates from the buoys in the range 0. 10 – 0. 35 Hz. Except for peak period, spectral estimates of wave height, mean energy period and spectral bandwidth from the vertical beam agree well with estimates from the buoys, showing only small differences of 2 – 7 %. Some cases exist where either the ADCP or the <b>buoys</b> <b>can</b> resolve particular wave systems that the other sensor cannot resolve, though some of these instances {{may be the result of}} numerical artefact. At low frequencies, the ADCP shows a better sensitivity to swell components, and though the <b>buoys</b> <b>can</b> produce low frequency peaks, the difference between the two sensors is particularly evident during low energy sea states.

2500|$|The basic rode {{system is}} a line, cable, or chain several times longer than {{the depth of the}} water running from the anchor to the mooring buoy, the longer the rode is the {{shallower}} the angle of force on the anchor (it has more scope). [...] A shallower scope means more of the force is pulling horizontally so that ploughing into the substrate adds holding power but also increases the swinging circle of each mooring, so lowering the density of any given mooring field. By adding weight {{to the bottom of the}} rode, such as the use of a length of heavy chain, the angle of force can be dropped further. Unfortunately, this scrapes up the substrate in a circular area around the anchor.
