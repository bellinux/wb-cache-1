40|$|This {{commentary}} {{discusses the}} recent reports in RNA by Yan <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>and</b> Westman <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> {{of the apparent}} failure of ribavirin to bind to recombinant eIF 4 E and inhibit 7 -methyl guanosine cap-dependent exogenous mRNA translation of cell extracts in vitro. Measuring binding by using affinity chromatography of matrix-immobilized proteins and by using protein emission fluorescence spectroscopy {{in the presence of}} nucleotide ligands, as well as limitations of using cell extracts for the assessment of mechanisms of mRNA translation are discussed. Possible reasons for the discordant findings of Yan <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>and</b> Westman <b>and</b> <b>colleagues</b> are suggested, <b>and</b> direct observation of the specific binding of ribavirin to eIF 4 E by using mass spectrometry is presented...|$|R

5|$|Henry's {{ability to}} govern was intimately {{bound up with}} the Church, which formed the key to the {{administration}} of both England and Normandy, and this relationship changed considerably {{over the course of his}} reign. William the Conqueror had reformed the English Church with the support of his Archbishop of Canterbury, Lanfranc, who became a close <b>colleague</b> <b>and</b> advisor to the King. Under William Rufus this arrangement had collapsed, the King and Archbishop Anselm had become estranged and Anselm had gone into exile. Henry also believed in Church reform, but on taking power in England he became embroiled in the investiture controversy.|$|E

5|$|After World War I, {{traveling}} {{was once}} again possible for the many young artists who {{had been forced to}} stay home during the six years of war. In 1920, Jolin went on a journey, first to Italy, North Africa and Spain for new international impressions, and then on to India, Africa and the West Indies. In the spring of 1924, Jolin went to Spain with his first wife, Britt von Zweigbergk. Like many other artists he painted the bullfights, but contrary to the strong, and sometimes bloody, bullfight painted by his <b>colleague</b> <b>and</b> close friend Gösta Adrian-Nilsson (GAN), Jolin's works were created in the calm and orderly manner that had earned him his second nickname: Eleganten Einar (Einar, the Elegant).|$|E
5|$|Between 1871 and 1874, {{while he}} lectured at the Conservatory, Rimsky-Korsakov {{thoroughly}} grounded himself in Western compositional techniques, {{and came to}} believe in the value of academic training for success as a composer. Once Rimsky-Korsakov had made this turn-around, Tchaikovsky considered him an esteemed <b>colleague,</b> <b>and,</b> if not the best of friends, was at least on friendly terms with him. When the other members of The Five became hostile toward Rimsky-Korsakov for his change of attitude, Tchaikovsky continued to support Rimsky-Korsakov morally, telling him that he fully applauded what Rimsky-Korsakov was doing, and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character. Beginning in 1876, Tchaikovsky was a regular visitor to the Rimsky-Korsakov home during his trips to Saint Petersburg. At one point, Tchaikovsky offered to have Rimsky-Korsakov appointed to the directorship of the Moscow Conservatory, but he refused.|$|E

5|$|Gray was {{a leading}} {{opponent}} of the Scientific Lazzaroni, a group of mostly physical scientists who wanted American academia to mimic the autocratic academic structures of European universities. A {{large percentage of the}} original 50 members of the National Academy of Sciences were Lazzaroni members. The American Academy of Arts and Sciences was opposed to the National Academy and collectively elected Gray and his friend, <b>colleague,</b> <b>and</b> fellow Charles Darwin supporter William Barton Rogers to the National Academy. Rogers founded the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This is one of the areas where Gray and his friend and colleague, Louis Agassiz, were in disagreement; Agassiz {{was a member of the}} Lazzaroni group. Agassiz had come to lecture at the Lowell Institute in 1846 and got hired by Harvard in 1847. Gray befriended him the way he had been befriended during his trip to Europe.|$|E

5|$|Méliès, who {{had begun}} A Trip to the Moon in May 1902, {{finished}} {{the film in}} August of that year and began selling prints to French distributors in the same month. From September through December 1902, a hand-colored print of A Trip to the Moon was screened at Méliès's Théâtre Robert-Houdin in Paris. The film was shown after Saturday and Thursday matinee performances by Méliès's <b>colleague</b> <b>and</b> fellow magician, Jules-Eugène Legris, who appeared {{as the leader of}} the parade in the two final scenes. Méliès sold black-and-white and color prints of the film through his Star Film Company, where the film was assigned the catalogue number 399–411 and given the descriptive subtitle Pièce à grand spectacle en 30 tableaux. In France, black-and-white prints sold for 560, and hand-colored prints for 1,000. Méliès also sold the film indirectly through Charles Urban's Warwick Trading Company in London.|$|E
5|$|Solti's first {{recordings}} were as a piano accompanist, {{playing at}} sessions in Zurich for the violinist Georg Kulenkampff in 1947. Decca's senior producer, Victor Olof did not much admire Solti as a conductor (nor did Walter Legge, Olof's opposite number at EMI's Columbia Records), but Olof's younger <b>colleague</b> <b>and</b> successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later James Walker, produced his recordings, Solti's {{career as a}} recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s. Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, London Philharmonic, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras. Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland, Régine Crespin, Plácido Domingo, Gottlob Frick, Carlo Bergonzi, Kiri Te Kanawa and José van Dam.

5|$|Su Song was a Hokkien who {{was born}} in modern-day Fujian, near medieval Quanzhou. Like a contemporary, Shen Kuo (1031–1095), Su Song was a polymath, a person whose {{expertise}} spans a significant number of different interests. It was written by his junior <b>colleague</b> <b>and</b> Hanlin scholar Ye Mengde (1077–1148) that in Su's youth, he mastered the provincial exams and rose {{to the top of the}} examination list for writing the best essay on general principles and structure of the Chinese calendar. From an early age, his interests in astronomy and calendrical science led him onto a distinguished path as a state bureaucrat. In his spare time he was fond of writing poetry, which he used to praise the works of artists such as the painter Li Gonglin (1049–1106). He also was an antiquarian and collector of old artworks from previous dynasties.|$|E
