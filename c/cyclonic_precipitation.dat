50|$|The path of Monsoon {{depressions}} that {{originate in}} the Bay of Bengal descends directly on the Upper Wardha catchment area. In the months of August and September, intense <b>cyclonic</b> <b>precipitation</b> also occurs over the catchment for one of two days as the low-pressure area formed in the Bay of Bengal and the cyclone moved in North West direction. On such occasions, intense rainfall is followed by flash flood runoff in the catchment. In view of these meteorological aspects heavy floods have been very common feature in this catchment. For such a flashy type of catchment with varying topography, runoff estimates at dam site are an involved process. The catchment drained at the dam site is of 4302 km2 and is fan shaped. The parameters of slope, soil and vegetation cover, which influence the hydrology of the project, vary widely. The average annual rainfall in the catchment is 840 mm, with 95% of occurring during monsoon period from June to September. The average annual inflow to the Upper Wardha Reservoir is estimated at 783 million cubic metres. The 75% dependable runoff is estimated as 500,720,000 cubic metres.|$|E
40|$|The {{winter monsoon}} brings {{a lot of}} snow on the Japan Sea side of Japanese Islands. On the contrary, the Pacific side of Japanese Islands has very fine weather. Therefore, weather {{boundaries}} between the Japan Sea side area and Pacific side area are important as the division line of climatic provinces. But, because the position of the weather boundaries differ from day by day, there are many different representations of climatic division. The writer defined the climatic division line with a new method. The ratio of amount of monsoon precipitation to monthly amount of precipitation in January, and the ratio of number of days with monsoon precipitation to number of days with precipitation in January were chosen as the measures of climatic division. As the result, the Japanese Islands were divided to three climatic porvinces, that is, the monsoon precipitation area, the <b>cyclonic</b> <b>precipitation</b> area and the transitional area...|$|E
40|$|A fast-moving, rapidly-deepening cyclone is {{analyzed}} {{mainly by}} means of hourly airways sequence reports in the Atlantic coastal plain of the United States. Six-hourly rainfall maps are presented showing the concentration of heavy rain along the cyclone path, and the strongly convective character of the <b>cyclonic</b> <b>precipitation.</b> Gusty surface winds are found mainly in t. he warm sector {{during the early stages}} of the cyclone. The momentum of the surface gusts is derived from that of higher layers and comes down to the surface in bursts through the unstable warm air. Because the stability of the frontal zone prevents the downward transport of gust momentum, the surface winds in the cold air are much lighter than in the warm air. However, in places the front is penetrated by the gusts, and the resulting vertical mixing brings warm air to the surface causing an acceleration of the surface warm front. As the cyclone deepens, the gust velocities increase in the cold air in proportion to the increase of pressure gradient. The momentum of the low-level jet at the top of the friction layer penetrates to the surface most readily when the surface pressure gradient force does not oppose the direction of the jet. An analysis of hourly pressure changes shows the existence of large-amplitude, high-speed pressure pulses moving across the cyclone. The pulses result in deformation of the pressure field, the generation of secondary centers, a. nd erratic motion of the cyclone. 1...|$|E
30|$|The {{exchange}} {{flow from}} BoB of about 754.6 [*]×[*] 106  m 3 {{which is based}} on balancing the outflow of salinity (Fig.  6) is also higher than the actual volume of the lagoon (500 [*]×[*] 106  m 3). This indicates that, while on one hand the flushing of the lagoon with the freshwater seems to have been complete, converting the lagoon temporarily into a freshwater lake, the balancing exchange flow from the sea in return is also observed to be higher and must have reached all portions of the lagoon which is quite unique. Such a dominant freshwater flushing in the recent past occurred in the year 1996 (Fig.  4 (a)) due to <b>cyclonic</b> storm-induced <b>precipitation</b> (Padma and Periakali 1999). Under the circumstances, the 2015 event had not only facilitated a significant drop in the average salinity but also lateral well-mixing of the waters within the lagoon.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an objective classification of circulation types for East-Central Europe with application to hourly precipitation events in Lublin (East Poland) from May to September. The {{development of the}} classification utilized sub-daily sea-level pressure values (at the main standard synoptic hours, i. e. 00, 06, 12 and 18 UTC). Sea-level pressure values and physical quantities (resultant flow direction and total shear vorticity) defined 27 circulation types: a) eight each of the directional cyclonic, transitional, and anticyclonic circulation types, and b) one each of the non-directional cyclonic, anticyclonic, and undefined types. In the years 1961 - 2010, the highest mean precipitation amount {{in the study area}} was recorded for cyclonic non-directional type C, followed by cyclonic types with air flow from the western and northern sectors. Type C was also distinguished by the highest number of precipitation events with high intensity irrespective of their duration, i. e. short-term, medium-term, and long-term precipitation events. Moreover, in the class of <b>cyclonic</b> types, <b>precipitation</b> events were considerably longer than in anticyclonic and transitional types. On the other hand, for anticyclonic types, precipitation with high intensity was recorded much more rarely, particularly in the case of advection from the southern sector...|$|R
40|$|Glaciological {{studies of}} the upper 10 m of the ice sheet in East Antarctica were made during the JARE South Pole Traverse 1968 - 1969. The glaciological studies {{consisted}} of studies of surface snow and subsurface snow by means of pits as well as analyses of snow cores. Conditions of surface snow such as accumulation, roughness, density and hardness are described in this paper. It is found that the conditions are distinctly different in four regions along the route from Syowa Station to the South Pole, {{and that they have}} a close connection with the slope inclination. Relationship between the snow conditions and the slope inclination is discussed in terms of the dependence of wind speed on the slope inclination. Thus, it is concluded that the conditions of surface snow are mainly controlled by wind speed. Measurements of annual snow accumulations disclose that local variations in accumulations take place in a strong wind region, and coincide with local topography of the region. Also, distinct regional differences in accumulations during the summer season are discussed from the differences between <b>cyclonic</b> and anticyclonic <b>precipitations.</b> Studies of subsurface snow in 2 m deep pits indicate that regions located in the north and south of 73 °S are characterized respectively by compact fine-grained snow and well-developed depth hoar. Analyses of snow cores from the surface to a depth of 10 m revealed the distribution of snow density in the upper 10 m of the ice sheet along the route from Syowa Station to the South Pole. Regional profiles of snow density at the depths of 5 and 9 m were different from those at the surface. This is due to the differences in the mean annual air temperature...|$|R
40|$|Meteorological nd glaciological {{analyses}} are integrated {{to examine the}} precipitation trends {{during the last three}} decades over the ice sheets covering Antarctica nd Greenland. For Antarctica, the best data source is provided by glaciologically-measured trends of snow accumulation, and for limited sectors of East Antarctica consistency with precipitation amounts calculated from the atmospheric water balance quation is obtained. For Greenland, precipitation rates parameterized from atmospheric analyses yield the only comprehensive depiction. The precipitation rate over Antarctica ppears to have increased by about 5 % over a time period spanning the accumulation means for the 1955 - 65 to 1965 - 75 periods, while over Greenland it has decreased by about 15 % since 1963 with a secondary increase over {{the southern part of the}} ice sheet starting in 1977. At the end of the 10 -year overlapping period, the global sea-level impact of the precipitation changes over Antarctica dominates that for Greenland and yields a net ice-sheet precipitation contribution of roughly- 0. 2 mmyr-~. These changes are likely due to marked variations in the cyclonic forcing affecting the ice sheets, but are only weakly reflected in the temperature r gime, con-sistent with the episodic nature of <b>cyclonic</b> <b>precipitation.</b> These conclusions are not founded on high quality data bases. The importance of such changes for understanding global sea-level variations argues for a modest research effort to collect simultaneous meteorological nd glaciological observations in order to describe and understand the current precipitation variations over both ice sheets. Some sugges-tions are offered for steps that could be taken. 1...|$|E
