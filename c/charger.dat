As {{the number}} of Electric Vehicle (EV) increases, the uncoordinated <b>charging</b> {{behaviors}} may cause the <b>charging</b> demand fluctuations and the <b>charging</b> load unbalanced. Besides, the users’ <b>charging</b> behaviors are affected by many factors.

By using Monte Carlo simulations and the image <b>charge</b> method, the zeta potential profile and the integrated <b>charge</b> distribution function are computed for varying surface <b>charge</b> strengths and salt concentrations. Systematic comparisons were carried out between three distinct models for interfacial charges: 1) SURF 1 with uniform surface <b>charges,</b> 2) SURF 2 with discrete point <b>charges</b> on the interface, and 3) SURF 3 with discrete interfacial <b>charges</b> and finite excluded volume. By comparing the integrated <b>charge</b> distribution function (ICDF) and potential profile, we argue that the potential at the distance of one ion diameter from the macroion surface is a suitable location to define the zeta potential. In SURF 2 model, we find that image <b>charge</b> effects strongly enhance <b>charge</b> inversion for monovalent interfacial <b>charges,</b> and strongly suppress <b>charge</b> inversion for multivalent interfacial <b>charges.</b> For SURF 3, the image <b>charge</b> effect becomes much smaller. Finally, with image <b>charges</b> in action, we find that excluded volumes (in SURF 3) suppress <b>charge</b> inversion for monovalent interfacial <b>charges</b> and enhance <b>charge</b> inversion for multivalent interfacial <b>charges.</b> Overall, our results demonstrate that all these aspects, i. e., image <b>charges,</b> interfacial <b>charge</b> discreteness, their excluding volumes have significant impacts on the zeta potential, and thus the structure of electric double layers.
