5000|$|Boronic acids are {{unusual in}} their ability to {{reversibly}} form covalent bonds with alcohols such as the active site serine in a serine <b>carbapenemase.</b> This property enables them to function as transition state analogs of serine carbapenemase-catalyzed lactam hydrolysis and thereby inhibit these enzymes. Based on data from Hecker et al., vaborbactam is a potent inhibitor of a variety of β-lactamases, exhibiting a 69-nanomolar [...] against the KPC-2 <b>carbapenemase</b> and even lower inhibition constants against CTX-M-15 and SHV-12.|$|E

50|$|Carbapenems are a {{class of}} {{beta-lactam}} antibiotics {{that are capable of}} killing most bacteria by inhibiting the synthesis of one of their cell wall layers. The carbapenems were developed to overcome antibiotic resistance mediated by bacterial beta-lactamase enzymes. However, the blaNDM-1 gene produces NDM-1, which is a <b>carbapenemase</b> beta-lactamase - an enzyme that hydrolyzes and inactivates these carbapenem antibiotics.|$|E
5000|$|Carbapenem-resistant Entero{{bacteria}}ceae (CRE) or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are Gram-negative {{bacteria that}} {{are resistant to}} the carbapenem class of antibiotics, considered the drugs of last resort for such infections. They are resistant because they produce an enzyme called a <b>carbapenemase</b> that disables the drug molecule. The resistance can vary from moderate to severe. Enterobacteriaceae are common commensals and infectious agents. Experts fear CRE as the new [...] "superbug". The bacteria can kill {{up to half of}} patients who get bloodstream infections. [...] Tom Frieden, former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has referred to CRE as [...] "nightmare bacteria". Types of CRE are sometimes known as KPC (Klebsiella pneumoniae <b>carbapenemase)</b> and NDM (New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase). KPC and NDM are enzymes that break down carbapenems and make them ineffective. Both of these enzymes, as well as the enzyme VIM (Verona Integron-Mediated Metallo-β-lactamase) have also been reported in Pseudomonas.|$|E
50|$|Carbapenems are famously stable to AmpC β-lactamases and extended-spectrum-β-lactamases. Carbapenemases are {{a diverse}} group of β-lactamases that are active not only against the oxyimino-cephalosporins and cephamycins but also against the carbapenems. Aztreonam is stable to the metallo-β-lactamases,but many IMP and VIM {{producers}} are resistant, owing to other mechanisms. Carbapenemases were formerly believed to derive only from classes A, B, and D, but a class C <b>carbapenemase</b> has been described.|$|E
5000|$|Aspergillomarasmine A is an polyamino acid {{naturally}} {{produced by}} the mold Aspergillus versicolor. The substance {{has been reported to}} inhibit two antibiotic resistance <b>carbapenemase</b> proteins in bacteria, New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) and Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase (VIM-2), and make those antibiotic-resistant bacteria susceptible to antibiotics. Aspergillomarasmine A is toxic to leaves of barley and other plants, being termed as [...] "Toxin C" [...] when produced by Pyrenophora teres.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{the reasons}} the CDC is recommending the {{detection}} of carbapenem resistance or <b>carbapenemase</b> production only for Klebsiella spp. and E. coli are: this facilitates performing the test in the microbiology laboratory {{without the use of}} molecular methods, and these organisms represent the majority of CREs encountered in the United States. Effective sterilization and decontamination procedures are important to keep the infection rate of this antibiotic-resistant strain, CRKP, as low as possible.|$|E
50|$|Klebsiella pneumoniae <b>carbapenemase</b> (KPC)-producing {{bacteria}} are {{a group of}} emerging highly drug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli causing infections associated with significant morbidity and mortality whose incidence is rapidly increasing {{in a variety of}} clinical settings around the world. Klebsiella pneumoniae includes numerous mechanisms for antibiotic resistance, many of which are located on highly mobile genetic elements. Carbapenem antibiotics (heretofore often the treatment of last resort for resistant infections) are generally not effective against KPC-producing organisms.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{mechanisms}} cause carbapenem {{resistance in the}} Enterobacteriaceae. These include hyperproduction of ampC beta-lactamase with an outer membrane porin mutation, CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamase with a porin mutation or drug efflux, and <b>carbapenemase</b> production. The most important mechanism of resistance by CRKP is {{the production of a}} <b>carbapenemase</b> enzyme, blakpc. The gene that encodes the blakpc enzyme is carried on a mobile piece of genetic material (a transposon; the specific transposon involved is called Tn4401), which increases the risk for dissemination. CRE can be difficult to detect because some strains that harbor blakpc have minimum inhibitory concentrations that are elevated, but still within the susceptible range for carbapenems. Because these strains are susceptible to carbapenems, they are not identified as potential clinical or infection control risks using standard susceptibility testing guidelines. Patients with unrecognized CRKP colonization have been reservoirs for transmission during nosocomial outbreaks. Depending on the type of infection and the mode of infectivity, cells of Klebsiella spp. may adhere and attack upper respiratory tract epithelial cells, cells in gastrointestinal tract, endothelial cells, or uroepithelial cells, followed by colonization of mucosal membranes (phac-aspc.gc.ca).|$|E
5000|$|Another {{advantage}} {{is the potential}} to predict antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria. A single mass spectral peak can predict methicillin resistance of Staphylococcus aureus [...] MALDI can also detect <b>carbapenemase</b> of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae, including Acinetobacter baumannii [...] and Klebsiella pneumoniae.However, most proteins that mediate antibiotic resistance are larger than MALDI-TOF´s 2000-20,000 Da range for protein peak interpretation and only occasionally, as in the 2011 KPC outbreak at the NIH, a correlation between a peak and resistance conferring protein can be made.|$|E
5000|$|A {{clinical}} isolate of E. coli {{from the}} sputum sample {{of a patient}} admitted to a Beijing hospital was found to acquire resistance to carbapenem through mutations not previously observed. It involved a mutation of a regulator gene marR and {{the expression of a}} normally nontranslated membrane porin yedS; both mutations were demonstrated to have effects on the ability of this strain of E.coli to resist carbapenems. The strain lacked the outer membrane proteins OmpF and OmpC, and showed increased expression of a multidrug efflux pump, but did not produce <b>carbapenemase.</b>|$|E
50|$|Three major {{classes of}} enzymes are {{involved}} in carbapenem resistance: class A carbapenemases, class B metallo-β-lactamases (MBL), and class D β-lactamases (OXA). The four known groups of class A carbapenemases are: SME (three types associated with S. marcescens), IMI (present in E. cloacae), GES (16 variants thus far found in P. aeruginosa predominantly but also found in K. pneumoniae and E. coli), and KPC (10 types of K. pneumoniae <b>carbapenemase).</b> At the UVA Medical Center, a transfer mechanism of KPC-dependent carbapenem resistance was discovered in the transmission of a plasmid carrying the transposon (Tn4401), which contains the KPC gene (blaKPC), to several bacteria including Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, E. coli, and Citrobacter freundii. The class B metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) are found largely in Gram-negative bacteria and environmental bacteria. The subclasses of MBL enzymes are B1, B2, and B3. MBLs have diverse enzymatic functions and {{have the ability to}} hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotics. The class D β-lactamases (OXA), which hydrolyze oxacillin, provide {{a good example of the}} variety of mechanisms that can be used to transfer resistance. The blaOXA genes which encode OXA β-lactamases are found on both chromosomes and plasmids, and they have their natural reservoir in environmental bacteria and deep-sea microflora. Insertions in the vicinity of these genes have been shown to increase the strength of their promoters and increase resistance. Because of these characteristics, a wide geographic dissemination of OXA <b>carbapenemase</b> resistance in particular has occurred.|$|E
50|$|Many {{metabolites}} {{produced by}} A. versicolor exhibit antibacterial, fungicidal, insecticidal, and cytotoxic properties. For example, a sesquiterpenoid nitrobenzoyl ester isolated from hyphae {{have been shown}} to be potent inhibitor of human breast and colon cancer cell lines. Other extracted compounds that are cytotoxic towards cancer cells include xanthones, fellutamides, and anthraquinones. Anthraquinone appears yellowish in appearance, and like other pigement molecules, it is regularly produced by A. versicolor. Additional studies on the fungus have demonstrated various metabolites with activity against bacteria such as M. tuberculosis and yeasts like C. albicans. Aspergillomarasmine A has been reported to inhibit two antibiotic resistance <b>carbapenemase</b> proteins in bacteria.|$|E
5000|$|Between 2007 and 2011, the {{percentage}} of Escherichia coli isolates from Canadian hospitals that produce extended spectrum beta lactamases (ESBL) increased from 3.4% to 4.1%; among Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates ESBL producers increased from 1.5% to 4.0%. These strains are resistant to third generation cephalosporins that were developed {{for the treatment of}} beta lactamase-producing ‘’Enterobacteriaceae’’ and carbapenems are generally regarded as the treatment of choice. [...] More recently, many countries have experienced a dramatic upswing in the prevalence of Enterobacteriaceace that produce both ESBLs and carbapenemases such as the Klebsiella pneumoniae <b>carbapenemase</b> (KPC). As of 2013, 70% of Greek Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates are resistant to third generation and cyclosporins and 60% are resistant to carbapenems. [...] The growing prevalence and difficulty of treating such multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceace has led to a renaissance of the use of antibiotics such as colistin, which was discovered in the 1950s but rarely used until recently due to unattractive levels of toxicity.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{there is}} {{currently}} a shortage of new drugs in the antimicrobial realm, {{there are a few}} antibiotics currently being studied and tested for the treatment of serious Gram-negative bacterial infections. These include cephalosporins, ceftobiprole, ceftarolin and FR-264205. The lack of newly emerging antimicobrial drugs have resulted in the revisit of old antibiotic drugs such as colistin and fosfomycin (Polymyxins), which are traditionally considered to be toxic but have gained a principal role in the treament of the most problematic MDR Gram-negative pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Also, there has been interest in the drug Tigecycline, which is from the class of antibiotics called called glycylcyclines, for treating MDRGN infections. [...] This drug shows promise in infections from multi-drug resistant K. pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae <b>carbapenemase</b> KPC- and ESBL-producing strains) and Enterobacteriaceae with various mechanisms of resistance. A review of investigational antibiotics shows that several new agents will become available in the coming years, even though the pace of antimicrobial research has proven far too slow.|$|E
50|$|Place all {{patients}} colonized or infected with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae on contact precautions. Acute-care facilities are {{to establish a}} protocol, {{in conjunction with the}} guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, to detect nonsusceptibility and <b>carbapenemase</b> production in Enterobacteriaceae, in particular Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli, and immediately alert epidemiology and infection-control staff members if identified. All acute-care facilities are to review microbiology records for the preceding 6-12 months to ensure that there have not been previously unrecognized CRE cases. If they do identify previously unrecognized cases, a point prevalence survey (a single round of active surveillance cultures) in units with patients at high risk (e.g., intensive-care units, units where previous cases have been identified, and units where many patients are exposed to broad-spectrum antimicrobials) is needed to identify any additional patients colonized with carbapenem-resistant or carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella spp. and E. coli. When a case of hospital-associated CRE is identified, facilities should conduct a round of active surveillance testing of patients with epidemiologic links to the CRE case (e.g., those patients in the same unit or patients having been cared for by the same health-care personnel).|$|E
30|$|Conclusion: Detection of <b>carbapenemase</b> in {{our study}} was higher (80 %), allows us to {{identify}} regions with high risk of <b>carbapenemase,</b> improve therapeutic efficacy and strengthen infection control measures by isolation of all <b>carbapenemase</b> producing patient.|$|E
40|$|The Modified Hodge Test (MHT) detects <b>carbapenemase</b> {{production}} in isolates of Enterobacteriaceae.

30|$|Furthermore, {{carbapenem}} resistant isolates (both P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii with <b>carbapenemase</b> genes), which lacked <b>carbapenemase</b> activity {{were also}} detected. As outlined above, this might reflect {{the difficulty in}} detecting <b>carbapenemase</b> production particularly in Acinetobacter (SMI P 8 2014); OXA-carbapenemases often have poor enzymatic activity leading to sub-optimal activity in some strains. Furthermore, carbapenem resistant isolates without <b>carbapenemase</b> genes and <b>carbapenemase</b> activity detected in this study alludes to the occurrence of additional non-carbapenemase resistance mechanisms in these isolates (outlined earlier) particularly in P. aeruginosa [e.g. upregulated efflux pumps, oprD loss (SMI P 8 2014)]. Non-carbapenemase mediated mechanisms need further study as we did not extensively characterize them in this study.|$|E
40|$|AbstractCarbapenemase-producing {{bacteria}} {{have now}} {{spread all over}} the world. Infections caused by those bacteria are difficult to treat. Therefore, there is an urgent need for accurate and fast detection of carbapenemases in diagnostic laboratories. In this review, we summarize screening methods for suspected isolates, direct assays for confirmation of <b>carbapenemase</b> activity (e. g. the Carba NP test and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry carbapenem hydrolysis assay), inhibitor-based methods for <b>carbapenemase</b> classification, and molecular-genetic techniques for precise identification of <b>carbapenemase</b> genes.

40|$|An Enterobacter cloacae isolate was {{recovered}} from a rectal swab from a patient hospitalized in France with previous travel to Switzerland. It was resistant to penicillins, narrow- and broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, and carbapenems but remained susceptible to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. Whereas PCR-based identification {{of the most common}} <b>carbapenemase</b> genes failed, the biochemical Carba NP test II identified an Ambler class A <b>carbapenemase.</b> Cloning experiments followed by sequencing identified a gene encoding a totally novel class A <b>carbapenemase,</b> FRI- 1, sharing 51 to 55 % amino acid sequence identity with the closest <b>carbapenemase</b> sequences. However, it shared conserved residues as a source of <b>carbapenemase</b> activity. Purified β-lactamase FRI- 1 hydrolyzed penicillins, aztreonam, and carbapenems but spared expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. The 50 % inhibitory concentrations (IC₅₀s) of clavulanic acid and tazobactam were 10 -fold higher than those found for Klebsiella pneumoniae <b>carbapenemase</b> (KPC), IMI, and SME, leading to lower sensitivity of FRI- 1 activity to β-lactamase inhibitors. The bla FRI- 1 gene was located on a ca. 110 -kb untypeable, transferable, and non-self-conjugative plasmid.

40|$|Various carbapenems {{have been}} {{reported}} in Pseudomonas aeruginosa such as VIM, NDM & OXA- 48, etc. In addition, <b>carbapenemase</b> producers are usually associated with many other non–β-lactam resistance determinants which give rise to multidrug and pan drug resistant isolates. Detection of these enzymes in infected patients and in carriers are the two main approaches for prevention of their spread. Potential <b>carbapenemase</b> producers are currently screened first by susceptibility testing, using breakpoint values for carbapenems. However, many <b>carbapenemase</b> producers do not confer obvious resistance levels to carbapenems. So there is need for Laboratories to search for <b>carbapenemase</b> producers. In such instance, phenotypic based test such as Modified Hodge Test (MHT) is very much useful in confirming in vitro production of <b>carbapenemase</b> enzymes. But this test does not differentiate serine <b>carbapenemase</b> enzyme (i. e. Ambler class A & C) from metallocarbapenemase (i. e. Ambler class B).

40|$|AbstractObjectivesA growing {{incidence}} of pathogens producing carbapenemases {{has been observed}} in many countries including Bangladesh. The present study was carried out to determine the presence of <b>carbapenemase</b> producers among uropathogens. Materials and MethodsA total of 138 Gram-negative uropathogens were isolated and identified by conventional methods and were screened for <b>carbapenemase</b> production using imipenem discs. Phenotypic identification of <b>carbapenemase</b> production {{was done by the}} double disc synergy test, combined disc assay, and modified Hodge test. The minimum inhibitory concentration of imipenem was determined by the agar dilution method. Genes encoding blaNDM- 1, blaIMP, blaVIM, blaKPC and blaOXA- 48 /blaOXA- 181 were identified by polymerase chain reaction. ResultsTwenty (14. 49 %) imipenem resistant strains were detected among 138 Gram-negative uropathogens. The most common isolates were Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. Among 20 imipenem resistant strains, 16 (80 %) <b>carbapenemase</b> producers were detected by polymerase chain reaction, 13 (65 %) by double disc synergy, 15 (75 %) by combined disc assay, and seven (35 %) by modified Hodge test. The blaNDM- 1 gene was most prevalent (55 %), followed by blaOXA- 48 /OXA- 181, blaKPC (20 %), blaVIM (15 %), and blaIMP (10 %). More than one <b>carbapenemase</b> gene was present in nine (45 %) of the isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentration of imipenem of the <b>carbapenemase</b> producers ranged from ≥ 128  μg/mL to 4  μg/mL. Overall, <b>carbapenemase</b> encoding genes were detected in 11. 6 % (16 / 138) of the studied Gram-negative uropathogens. All (100 %) of the carbapenemase-producing organisms were resistant to all tested antibiotics apart from colistin.

40|$|Class D β-lactamases with <b>carbapenemase</b> {{activity}} are emerging as carbapenem-resistance determinants in gram-negative bacterial pathogens, mostly Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. <b>Carbapenemase</b> activity {{is an unusual}} feature among class D β-lactamases, and the structural elements responsible for this activity remain unclear. Based on structural and molecular dynamics data, we previously hypothesized a potential role of the residues located in the short-loop connecting strands β 5 and β 6 (the β 5 -β 6 loop) in conferring the <b>carbapenemase</b> activity of the OXA- 48 enzyme. In this work, the narrow-spectrum OXA- 10 class D β-lactamase, which is unable to hydrolyze carbapenems, {{was used as a}} model to investigate the possibility of evolving <b>carbapenemase</b> activity by replacement of the β 5 -β 6 loop with those present in three different lineages of class D carbapenemases (OXA- 23, OXA- 24, and OXA- 48). Biological assays and kinetic measurements showed that all three OXA- 10 -derived hybrids acquired significant <b>carbapenemase</b> activity. Structural analysis of the OXA- 10 loop 24 and OXA- 10 loop 48 hybrids revealed no significant changes in the molecular fold of the enzyme, except for the orientation of the substituted β 5 -β 6 loops, which was reminiscent of that found in their parental enzymes. These results demonstrate the crucial role of the β 5 -β 6 loop in the <b>carbapenemase</b> activity of class D β-lactamases, and provide previously unexplored insights into the mechanism by which these enzymes can evolve <b>carbapenemase</b> activity...|$|E
