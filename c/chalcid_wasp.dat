5|$|Other {{arthropods}} {{may make}} use of the antlion larva's ability to trap prey. The larva of the Australian horsefly (Scaptia muscula) lives in antlion (for example Myrmeleon pictifrons) pit traps and feeds on the prey caught, and the female <b>chalcid</b> <b>wasp</b> (Lasiochalcidia igiliensis) purposefully allows itself to be trapped so that it can parasitise the antlion larva by ovipositing between its head and thorax.|$|E
5|$|Encarsia formosa {{is a small}} predatory <b>chalcid</b> <b>wasp</b> {{which is}} a {{parasitoid}} of whitefly, a sap-feeding insect which can cause wilting and black sooty moulds in glasshouse vegetable and ornamental crops. It is most effective when dealing with low level infestations, giving protection {{over a long period}} of time. The wasp lays its eggs in young whitefly 'scales', turning them black as the parasite larvae pupate. Gonatocerus ashmeadi (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) has been introduced to control the glassy-winged sharpshooter Homalodisca vitripennis (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) in French Polynesia and has successfully controlled ~95% of the pest density.|$|E

5|$|Butterflies are {{threatened}} {{in their early}} stages by parasitoids and in all stages by predators, diseases and environmental factors. Braconid and other parasitic wasps lay their eggs in lepidopteran eggs or larvae and the wasps' parasitoid larvae devour their hosts, usually pupating inside or outside the desiccated husk. Most wasps are very specific about their host species and some {{have been used as}} biological controls of pest butterflies like the large white butterfly. When the small cabbage white was accidentally introduced to New Zealand, it had no natural enemies. In order to control it, some pupae that had been parasitised by a <b>chalcid</b> <b>wasp</b> were imported, and natural control was thus regained. Some flies lay their eggs on the outside of caterpillars and the newly hatched fly larvae bore their way through the skin and feed in a similar way to the parasitoid wasp larvae. Predators of butterflies include ants, spiders, wasps, and birds.|$|E
25|$|The {{fossil record}} of fairyflies extends {{from at least}} the Albian age (about 100 Mya) of the Early Cretaceous. They are the only <b>chalcid</b> <b>wasp</b> family known from the Cretaceous, thus are {{considered}} the most primitive family within Chalcidoidea.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} insect inquilines live harmlessly within the oak marble gall {{and some of}} these, as well as Andricus itself, are {{parasitised}} by insects referred to as parasitoids. The <b>chalcid</b> <b>wasp</b> Torymus nitens {{is an example of}} a parasitoid in oak marble galls. The presence of these inquilines and parasites is often visible on older galls by the presence of fine exit-holes, smaller than that of the gall wasp itself.|$|E

25|$|Cretaceous fairyflies {{are much}} rarer. In 1975, Carl M. Yoshimoto {{described}} four genera of fairyflies from the Cretaceous of Canada. In 2011, John T. Huber and George Poinar, Jr. described the genus Myanmymar from Burmese amber. Dating {{back to the}} Upper Albian age (about 100 mya) of the Early Cretaceous, it is the oldest known fairyfly (and <b>chalcid</b> <b>wasp).</b> They are surprisingly very similar to modern genera, though with {{a greater number of}} flagellar segments and longer forewing veins. The characteristics of the fossil (taking into account Yoshimoto's earlier discoveries) led them to conclude fairfylies either may have existed much earlier than Myanmymar, or they may have diversified rapidly during that time period.|$|E
500|$|Megachile campanulae can be parasitized by {{a number}} of brood parasites, {{including}} Monodontomerus obscurus, a <b>Chalcid</b> <b>wasp.</b> [...] The kleptoparasitic bee Stelis louisae has been found in the nests. [...] Members of the genus Coelioxys are also known parasites of Megachile. [...] Kleptoparasitic bees characteristically deposit their eggs in the nests of other bees. [...] As this behavior {{is similar to that of}} cuckoo birds, such bees are referred to as cuckoo bees. [...] These host-parasite relationships are complex and the relationships between M. campanulae and other parasitic species may not be well described.|$|E
500|$|Kincaid was {{dispatched}} to Japan in 1908 by the United States Department of Agriculture {{to identify and}} collect a natural parasite for the gypsy moth, which, at the time, was creating havoc in Massachusetts. His continued research on that parasite, the <b>Chalcid</b> <b>wasp,</b> took him to Russia the following year. The parasite that he discovered was bred by the US Department of Agriculture as a gypsy moth repellent for many years thereafter. His later work on oyster breeding earned him the nickname the [...] "father of the Northwest oyster industry". During his years at the UW, he was also credited with helping to establish the university's College of Fisheries.|$|E

2500|$|The gall-wasp Periclistus brandtii causes no gall itself, but {{deposits}} its {{eggs in the}} bedeguar tissues {{on which}} the larvae feed. In turn, these larvae may be parasitised by a <b>chalcid</b> <b>wasp,</b> Eurytoma rosae, which works its way from one inquiline's cell to the next. The parasitoid ichneumon Orthopelma mediator lays its eggs directly into larvae of D. rosae, killing them. The chalcid wasps Eurytoma rosae and Glyphomerus stigma can attack both the larvae of D. rosae and of the inquiline [...] P. brandtii. These parasitoids may in turn be attacked by hyperparasitoids such as the chalcids Caenacis inflexa and Pteromalus bedeguaris. [...] The mossy and sticky filaments of the gall are clearly ineffective in preventing the entry of inquilines, predators, parasitoids and hyperparasitoids.|$|E
2500|$|Where u(x, t) is {{the flow}} field, p the pressure, ρ {{the density of}} the fluid, ν the {{kinematic}} viscosity, ubd the velocity at the boundary, and us the velocity of the solid. By choosing a length scale, L, and velocity scale, U, the equation can be expressed in nondimensional form containing the Reynolds number, Re=UL/ν [...] There are two obvious differences between an insect wing and an airfoil: An insect wing is much smaller and it flaps. Using a dragonfly as an example, Its chord (c) is about 1cm, its wing length (l) about 4cm, and its wing frequency (f) about 40Hz. The tip speed (u) is about 1m/s, and the corresponding Reynolds number, Re=uc/ν about 103. At the smaller end, a <b>Chalcid</b> <b>wasp</b> has a wing length of about 0.5–0.7mm and beats its wing at about 400Hz. Its Reynolds number is about 25. The range of Reynolds number in insect flight is about 10 to 104, which lies in between the two limits that are convenient for theories: inviscid steady flows around an airfoil and Stokes flow experienced by a swimming bacterium. For this reason, this intermediate range is not well understood. On the other hand, it is perhaps the most ubiquitous regime among the things we see. Falling leaves and seeds, fishes, and birds all encounter unsteady flows similar to that seen around an insect.|$|E
