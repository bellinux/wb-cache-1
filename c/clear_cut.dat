40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Wildlife Management, 2009 I {{examined}} the relationship between seasonal habitat use and changes in cover and quality of forage in different vegetation types used by Roosevelt elk (Cervus elaphus roosevelti) in managed forests on the Hoko game management unit, Olympic Peninsula, Washington. Elk were expected to maximize energetic gain by using vegetation types that contained the greatest cover of good quality forage (i. e. high energy and protein content, low tannin content) during each season. Old <b>clear</b> <b>cuts</b> (> 21 years old) contained poor quality evergreen forage (e. g. Tsuga heterophylla, Gaultheria shallon), and elk used these old <b>clear</b> <b>cuts</b> less than expected given their availability throughout the year. Riparian areas contained good quality deciduous forage (e. g. Rubus spectabilis, Sambucus racemosa, Athyrium filix-femina), and elk used riparian areas more than expected given their availability in spring and fall. Shrub cover was extensive and shrub quality was good across the landscape in summer, and elk used each vegetation type, except old <b>clear</b> <b>cuts,</b> in proportion to its availability during summer. Forage cover was limited and quality was poor across the landscape in winter. Elk used each vegetation type, except old <b>clear</b> <b>cuts,</b> in proportion to its availability during winter. Non-forest areas had greater cover of good quality graminoids and forbs throughout the year than riparian areas and <b>clear</b> <b>cuts,</b> and were used more than expected given their availability. Younger <b>clear</b> <b>cuts</b> (??? 21 years old) were never used more than expected given their availability, though they contained great cover of deciduous forage. However, they also had less cover of good quality forage than non-forest or riparian areas. In conclusion, when forage cover and quality were similar across vegetation types, elk used vegetation types in proportion to their availabilities. When forage cover and quality were greater in riparian and non-forest areas than in other vegetation types, elk used riparian and non-forest areas more than expected given their availabilities. Therefore, I concluded that elk maximized energetic gain by utilizing vegetation types that contained the greatest cover of good quality forage in each season. However, good quality forage species that have been linked to increased herd reproduction on the study area grew primarily in non-forest and riparian areas. These findings suggest that non-forest and riparian areas are of greater benefit to the nutritional condition and reproduction of Roosevelt elk on the Hoko game management unit than younger <b>clear</b> <b>cuts.</b> Makah Tribe, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Green Crow, Merrill and Ring, Rayonier, and Crown Pacific timber companies, Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlif...|$|R

5|$|Six {{minutes into}} the match, Ronny Johnsen fouled Bayern striker Carsten Jancker just outside the area, and Mario Basler placed a low free kick around the United wall to score the first goal. Contrary to popular belief, the free kick was not a deflection, but rather swerved into the far bottom corner of Peter Schmeichel's goal. Despite the bad start, United began to {{dominate}} possession but failed to create any <b>clear</b> <b>cut</b> chances despite David Beckham's tireless running. They seemed to be badly missing influential midfielders Paul Scholes and Roy Keane. The Bayern defence remained strong and well organised, as Andy Cole found out when his close-range effort was quickly closed down by three defenders. As Bayern began to look increasingly more dangerous on the counter-attack than their opponents did in possession, Jancker repeatedly tested the United back four {{with a number of}} clever runs, some of which were flagged offside.|$|E
5|$|Avi Shlaim, Emeritus Professor of International Relations in the University of Oxford, {{asserts that}} two main {{schools of thought}} have been {{developed}} {{on the question of}} the primary driving force behind the declaration, one presented in 1961 by Leonard Stein, a lawyer and former political secretary to the World Zionist Organization, and the other in 1970 by Mayir Vereté, then Professor of Israeli History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Shlaim states that Stein does not reach any <b>clear</b> <b>cut</b> conclusions, but that implicit in his narrative is that the declaration resulted primarily from the activity and skill of the Zionists, whereas according to Vereté, it was the work of hard-headed pragmatists motivated by British imperial interests in the Middle East. Much of modern scholarship on the decision to issue the declaration focuses on the Zionist movement and rivalries within it, with a key debate being whether the role of Weizmann was decisive or whether the British were likely to have issued a similar declaration in any event. Danny Gutwein, Professor of Jewish History at the University of Haifa, proposes a twist on an old idea, asserting that Sykes's February 1917 approach to the Zionists was the defining moment, and that it was consistent with the pursuit of the government’s wider agenda to partition the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

40|$|Abstract only availableIt is {{important}} for researchers {{to be aware of}} how timber management practices affect songbird populations. Certain forest management techniques can cause declines in breeding habitat of Neotropical migrant songbirds that require mature forest. The worm-eating warbler (Helmitheros vermivorus) is a common mature forest-dwelling species that may experience a decline in density due to habitat alterations such as clear cutting and selection cutting. As regeneration of the <b>clear</b> <b>cuts</b> occurs, mature forest-dwelling species may be able to utilize these areas as suitable habitat. This summer was the first year that worm-eating warblers settled on the 8 year old <b>clear</b> <b>cuts</b> on the sites of the Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project. We compared the relative abundance of worm-eating warblers that inhabited even-aged sites with those that inhabited control sites by using point counts of each site. In order to determine pairing success, we followed a singing male until the bird was seen interacting with a female or for 90 minutes if no interaction was seen. We hypothesized that the worm-eating warblers will have lower pairing success on even-aged sites (<b>clear</b> <b>cuts)</b> than control sites. We also hypothesized that the densities of worm-eating warblers would be the highest on the control sites and the lowest on the uneven-aged (selection cuts) sites, with the density of the even-aged sites falling slightly below that of the control sites.

30|$|The {{management}} of spruce begins when stand density drops below about 1.800 stems∙ha− 1 up to a canopy height of 2  m. At a DBH of 7 to 15  cm, about 60 to 100 “future trees” per hectare are promoted by removing competitors. Thinning is already economical, i.e. it has market value. The {{aim of the}} management is a continuous-cover forestry regime, with natural regeneration under shelter, to minimize the expenditure for regeneration. Harvesting {{is based on the}} economic conditions. In spruce-dominated forests, trees should be harvested at a diameter lower than 35  cm. For this reason, most stems are harvested at an age[*]<[*] 80  years. Stems are mainly sold as logs in 4  m and 5  m lengths. <b>Clear</b> <b>cuts</b> are possible, but they are subject to permission by the forest administration. The overall objective is to harvest as early as possible, but to avoid <b>clear</b> <b>cuts</b> and plantations, and to maintain a permanent forest cover with natural regeneration.|$|R
40|$|AbstractPartial cutting {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{as a means to}} better conserve biodiversity in managed forest landscapes. However, partial cutting encompasses many forms of silviculture; some with implicit goals of maintaining biodiversity such as multicohort harvesting or others which may specifically focus on regeneration of stands but may still provide some additional benefits for biodiversity such as shelterwood harvesting. Here we compared ground beetle assemblages of <b>clear</b> <b>cuts,</b> shelterwoods, multicohort harvested stands and uncut stands collected using pitfall traps both 2 and 3 -years post-harvest. We hypothesized that partial cutting treatments would maintain assemblages that were more similar to uncut stands than to <b>clear</b> <b>cuts.</b> We further hypothesized that among partial cuts the multicohort harvested stands, with relatively high levels of retention (66 %), would maintain beetle assemblages that were more similar to uncut stands than would shelterwoods, which had lower levels of retention (50 %). We collected 6692 individuals, representing 42 species. Catch rates of beetles were similar among all harvested treatments (shelterwood, multicohort and <b>clear</b> <b>cuts)</b> and lower than uncut stands. Species richness and composition was similar between shelterwood and multicohort stands. Both partial cut treatments fell between <b>clear</b> <b>cuts</b> and uncut stands in terms of species richness and compositional similarity. Compositional differences between uncut stands and partial cut stands were defined primarily by reduced abundances of forest associated species such as Agonum retractum (LeConte), Synuchus impunctatus (Say) and four Pterostichus species within partial cuts. Within partial cuts, beetle assemblages differed between machine corridors with 0 % retention and adjacent partial cut strips (50 % retention) and uncut vegetation corridors (100 %). We conclude that both shelterwoods and multicohort harvesting stands provide at least initially similar benefits for biodiversity compared to clear cutting although neither maintains assemblages consistent with those found in uncut stands. We expect that these similarities will end once trees are removed from shelterwoods. The reductions in abundances within partial cuts may extend the time necessary for individual populations to increase to pre-harvest levels in partial cuts. For land-managers, similar initial responses of beetle assemblages in multicohort and shelterwood harvests may permit some flexibility for conservation planning whereby final removal of seed trees within shelterwoods could be delayed depending on the status of recovering beetle populations...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the {{importance}} of renewable energy sources, including biomass, has considerably increased in EU and Nordic regions. The target level for EU is to reach 20 % of total energy consumption. Latvia has to increase its share of renewables by 7 % to reach its goal of 40 % by 2020. The main, and still not fully used, renewable resource is biomass in Latvia. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate available and potential resources of biomass from <b>clear</b> <b>cuts</b> now and in the future. Core data is taken from the National Forest Inventory (NFI), which is done for the first time in the history of Latvia. Availability of biomass is estimated at three levels and nine sublevels showing the change of available biomass today and in the future if harvest intensity and technologies of collecting energy wood in <b>clear</b> <b>cuts</b> are improved. Also, possible changes in the pulpwood market are reviewed. Level 1 expresses harvest intensity according to data from the State Forest Service. According to data from NFI level 2 shows the same pattern as level 1 and level 3 gives the maximum level of available biomass. Results are expressed in oven dry tones of energy wood. Today the main limiting factor for the expansion of energy extraction from wood from <b>clear</b> <b>cuts</b> is the cost of energy wood. About 20 % of all <b>clear</b> <b>cuts</b> are used for energy wood collection. The quantities that are produced today may be increased by about three times by optimizing the utilization of <b>clear</b> <b>cuts</b> used for energy wood extraction and slight improvements in methods and technologies. The main assortment of energy wood at the moment is logging residues and firewood. At level 1, biomass potential is 0. 79 m odt (oven dry tons) annually. If, at the same level, stump lifting would be introduced, available biomass would be 0. 98 m odt (level 1. 1). With improved technologies and optimal land use, biomass for energy would reach 2. 54 m odt. If in the market situation price for pulpwood is too low and it is used as energy wood, available biomass would be 3. 66 m odt. At the base of level 2, available biomass is 1. 06 m odt annually. With the stump lifting at level 2. 1, the volume of energy wood is 1. 30 m odt. Optimal land use and improved technologies at level 2. 2 gives 3. 40 m odt. By adding pulpwood biomass potential at the level 2. 3, it is possible to reach 4. 89 m odt. At the maximum harvest intensity at level 3 biomass potential is 2. 21 m odt, level 3. 1 gives 2. 73 m odt, level 3. 2 – 7. 10 m odt, and the maximum annually available biomass potential at level 3. 3 is 10. 23 m odt. It is rather hard to estimate biomass potential from the raw data of NFI, but the results look realistic when compared to other studies. Extra quantities of energy wood could be added from wood processing as a secondary source of biomass, which is not considered in this paper...|$|R
