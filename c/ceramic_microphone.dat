5000|$|The Varitone was a woodwind {{pickup and}} effects unit, {{allowing}} direct amplification {{of the instrument}} (i.e. without a standard microphone) {{and the introduction of}} various electronic effects. It was marketed in 1967 by the Selmer Company, which developed units for flute, saxophone, and clarinet. The system included an integrated pickup microphone and a control box which allowed the player to use effects such as tremolo, basic EQ ("bright" [...] and [...] "dark"), simultaneous sub-octaves and echo in conjunction with a purpose built amplifier. The <b>ceramic</b> <b>microphone</b> was developed to withstand high sound pressure and moisture levels, and built into the head joint of the flute, the neck-joint of the saxophone, and the barrel joint of the clarinet. The pickup was wired to a preamplifier and control box which was either mounted to the bottom key guard, clipped to the player's belt, or hung on a cord around the players neck.|$|E
5000|$|The ceramic EIA Class 2 dielectrics used in high-K {{capacitors}} ("Z5U" [...] and [...] "X7R") are piezoelectric {{and directly}} transform mechanical vibration into a voltage {{in exactly the}} same way as a <b>ceramic</b> or piezoelectric <b>microphone.</b> Film capacitors using soft (mechanically compliant) dielectric materials can also be microphonic due to vibrational energy physically moving the plates of the capacitor. Likewise, variable capacitors using air as a dielectric are vulnerable to vibrations moving the plates. Capacitors using glass as the dielectric, while quite expensive, can be made to be essentially nonmicrophonic.|$|R
