5|$|Before the 1980s and {{increased}} prosperity on the mainland, Chinese domestic workers were dominant. Until the 1990s, workers then came {{primarily from the}} Philippines; the percentage is now shifting from Philippine workers to Indonesian and other nationalities. During the 1990s Indonesia and Thailand followed the Filipino model of labour export to deal with domestic economic <b>crises,</b> <b>and</b> Hong Kong families began hiring workers from those countries as well. The Indonesians provided competition, since those workers were often prepared to accept half the minimum wage.|$|E
5|$|Between the 1810s and 1850s {{there were}} a series of changes in {{ownership}} and management. These coincided with a Puritan revival and a fall in Bath's popularity; reductions in receipts were compounded by rising payments for actors from London. As a result, the theatre underwent financial <b>crises</b> <b>and</b> fell into a period of decline. Fortunes began to improve when James Henry Chute, who was {{the manager of the}} Bath Assembly Rooms and the son-in-law of the owner Mrs Macready, took over as the manager of the theatre and once again audiences began to rise.|$|E

40|$|This {{issue of}} the Journal brings {{together}} a number of comparative articles on illness, <b>crisis,</b> <b>and</b> loss. This issue illuminates that illness, <b>crisis,</b> <b>and</b> loss are central forces shaping personal biographies and social life across comparative cultures. These international articles draw on qualitative methodologies to tap an understanding of illness and in combination provide a broad yet holistic perspective on the interrelationships of illness, <b>crisis</b> <b>and</b> loss. Each of the articles illustrates how they contribute to social change and how the cultural meanings of illness, <b>crisis</b> <b>and</b> loss are created {{to make sense of}} personal experiences in contemporary society. These are important existential issues but also significant additions to debates and discussions on illness, <b>crisis,</b> <b>and</b> loss for practitioners, user groups, and researchers. Engaging with different cultural contexts is essential to see how illness, <b>crisis,</b> <b>and</b> loss is experienced, managed, and researched...|$|R

5|$|Inspired by {{personal}} <b>crises</b> <b>and</b> global events, We Don't Need to Whisper was conceptualized as DeLonge taught himself to play instruments and created {{his own home}} studio. He recruited his longtime friend and guitarist David Kennedy of Box Car Racer, as well as drummer Atom Willard and bassist Ryan Sinn to form Angels & Airwaves, who were primarily inspired by arena rock groups such as U2 and The Police. DeLonge's later public statements regarding the band's music prompted media interest and concern from his relatives and family.|$|E
5|$|Jefferson, on {{the other}} hand, took a stricter view of the Constitution: parsing the text carefully, he found no {{specific}} authorization for a national bank. This controversy was eventually settled by the Supreme Court of the United States in McCulloch v. Maryland, which in essence adopted Hamilton's view, granting the federal government broad freedom to select the best means to execute its constitutionally enumerated powers, specifically the doctrine of implied powers. Nevertheless, the American Civil War and the Progressive Era demonstrated the sorts of <b>crises</b> <b>and</b> politics Hamilton's administrative republic sought to avoid.|$|E

Soldiers of the brigade also participated in assistance with community projects around the Fort Riley community, including repairing and refurbishing run down properties for shelter house projects as well as disabled veterans. After two years of duty, the brigade was inactivated on 16 October 1999 at Fort Riley, Kansas.|$|E

This issue shines light on illness, <b>crisis,</b> <b>and</b> loss as central forces shaping our personal experiences, social life, and order. The articles all, in one way or another, draw on various disciplines relating to education, sociology, philosophy, and psychology to provide different perspectives on the interrelationships of illness, <b>crisis,</b> <b>and</b> loss, showing how they contribute to social change and how the meanings of illness, <b>crisis,</b> <b>and</b> loss are generated to serve social functions but used to make sense of personal narratives in contemporary society...|$|R

5|$|The {{frequency}} of <b>crises</b> <b>and</b> {{the severity of}} the 1907 panic added to concern about the outsized role of J.P. Morgan which led to renewed impetus toward a national debate on reform. In May 1908, Congress passed the Aldrich–Vreeland Act that established the National Monetary Commission to investigate the panic and to propose legislation to regulate banking. Senator Nelson Aldrich (R–RI), the chairman of the National Monetary Commission, went to Europe for almost two years to study that continent's banking systems.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet media {{frequently}} covered racial discrimination, financial <b>crises,</b> <b>and</b> {{unemployment in}} the United States, which were viewed as failings of the capitalist system that had been erased by communism. Lynchings of African Americans were seen as an embarrassing skeleton in the closet for the US, which the Soviets used {{as a form of}} rhetorical ammunition when reproached for their own economic and social failings. The phrase grew in usage in the 1960s during the Cold War. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the phrase became widespread as a reference to Russian information-warfare tactics. Its use subsequently became widespread in Russia to criticize any form of U.S. policy.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{experimental}} {{support for this}} hypothesis, it remains controversial. A common critique is that devoutness is easy to fake, such as simply by attending a religious service. However, the hypothesis predicts that {{people are more likely}} to join and contribute to a religious group when its rituals are costly. Another critique specifically asks: why religion? There is no evolutionary advantage to evolving religion over other signals of commitment such as nationality, as Irons admits. However, the reinforcement of religious rites as well as the intrinsic reward and punishment system found in religion makes it an ideal candidate for increasing intragroup cooperation. Finally, there is insufficient evidence for increase in fitness as a result of religious cooperation. However, Sosis argues for benefits from religion itself, such as increased longevity, improved health, assistance during <b>crises,</b> <b>and</b> greater psychological well being though both the supposed benefits from religion and the costly-signaling mechanism have been contested.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the market}} {{turbulence}} of the 1990s financial <b>crises</b> <b>and</b> September 11 {{attacks on the}} U.S. in 2001, financial integration intensified among developed nations and emerging markets, with substantial growth in capital flows among banks and in the trading of financial derivatives and structured finance products. Worldwide international capital flows grew from $3 trillion to $11 trillion U.S. dollars from 2002 to 2007, primarily {{in the form of}} short-term money market instruments. The United States experienced growth in the size and complexity of firms engaged in a broad range of financial services across borders {{in the wake of the}} Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999 which repealed the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, ending limitations on commercial banks' investment banking activity. Industrialized nations began relying more on foreign capital to finance domestic investment opportunities, resulting in unprecedented capital flows to advanced economies from developing countries, as reflected by global imbalances which grew to 6% of gross world product in 2007 from 3% in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The third {{series of}} Cold Feet (2000) was {{extended}} {{from six to}} eight episodes by ITV. Bullen believed that the production team had covered all potential storylines {{in the first two}} series, so declined to write any more episodes. A team of five writers was hired by Granada Television, overseen by Bullen as a co-executive producer. Four out of the five writers left the team due to their scripts not being appropriate for the series, leaving only David Nicholls on staff. The writing process had made Bullen think twice about not writing and he began thinking about further storylines, such as mid-life <b>crises</b> <b>and</b> IVF. The same year, he signed a two-year contract with Granada to develop new projects. A fourth series of Cold Feet, also of eight episodes, was commissioned for 2001. Bullen announced {{that he did not want}} to write a fifth series, and that the fourth would be the last. His reasons were that with ITV's proposed commission of up to 20 episodes a year, the series would become like a soap opera. The popularity of the fourth series persuaded Bullen to write four more episodes that formed the fifth series in 2003. The fifth series won Bullen the Writer of the Year Award at the 2003 British Comedy Awards.|$|E
5|$|Financial {{integration}} among {{industrialized nations}} grew substantially during the 1980s and 1990s, as did liberalization of their capital accounts. Integration among financial markets and banks rendered {{benefits such as}} greater productivity and the broad sharing of risk in the macroeconomy. The resulting interdependence also carried a substantive cost in terms of shared vulnerabilities and increased exposure to systemic risks. Accompanying financial integration in recent decades was a succession of deregulation, in which countries increasingly abandoned regulations over the behavior of financial intermediaries and simplified requirements of disclosure {{to the public and}} to regulatory authorities. As economies became more open, nations became increasingly exposed to external shocks. Economists have argued greater worldwide financial integration has resulted in more volatile capital flows, thereby increasing the potential for financial market turbulence. Given greater integration among nations, a systemic crisis in one can easily infect others. The 1980s and 1990s saw a wave of currency <b>crises</b> <b>and</b> sovereign defaults, including the 1987 Black Monday stock market crashes, 1992 European Monetary System crisis, 1994 Mexican peso crisis, 1997 Asian currency crisis, 1998 Russian financial crisis, and the 1998–2002 Argentine peso crisis. These crises differed in terms of their breadth, causes, and aggravations, among which were capital flights brought about by speculative attacks on fixed exchange rate currencies perceived to be mispriced given a nation's fiscal policy, self-fulfilling speculative attacks by investors expecting other investors to follow suit given doubts about a nation's currency peg, lack of access to developed and functioning domestic capital markets in emerging market countries, and current account reversals during conditions of limited capital mobility and dysfunctional banking systems.|$|E

40|$|Much {{current work}} in social {{sciences}} seeks {{to understand the}} role and development of trust in the network of modern society. However, the development process of the trust remains unclear. To explore the dynamic process of <b>crisis</b> <b>and</b> trust, this paper primarily examines on the role that trust plays in the financial manager’s network relation, {{and the influence of}} its interaction with the banks. This study focuses on a state-owned enterprise in Taiwan that suffered from financial <b>crisis</b> <b>and</b> downsizing. Systems thinking combined with narrative inquiry are adopted to investigate the dynamic change of relationship between the enterprise and banks before <b>and</b> after <b>crisis.</b> The findings show that trust becomes considerably important when an enterprise suffers from a financial <b>crisis,</b> <b>and</b> the relation between the enterprise and banks tends to change after the crisis. Finally, an integrative model for <b>crisis</b> <b>and</b> trust is proposed to improve Webb’s model and contributes to interpret the dynamic relation of <b>crisis</b> <b>and</b> trust...|$|R
5|$|The club {{failed to}} achieve further league or cup success until the {{appointment}} of former Everton player Howard Kendall in 1981. Kendall initially proved unpopular with the Goodison Park crowd, {{but this was not}} to last as he led Everton to their most successful season ever winning the European Cup Winners' Cup and the First Division in the 198485 season. Following success in the Charity Shield twice and another League championship in 198687, Kendall resigned from Everton to manage Spanish side Athletic Bilbao. He returned for two further spells during the 1990s (1990-1993 & 1997-1998) but without such success. Former Everton player and Oldham Athletic manager Joe Royle was appointed in 1994 following the disastrous reign of Mike Walker (1994 for 10 months) winning the FA Cup in the same season. Injury <b>crises</b> <b>and</b> players such as Andrei Kanchelskis being sold led to Royle's resignation in March 1997. Former Rangers manager, Walter Smith, took the position in August 1998, but he failed to transfer the success he had achieved in Scotland. With three bottom-half finishes in his first three seasons, and facing relegation in the 200102 season, Smith was sacked. He was replaced by fellow Scot David Moyes who led the club back into European football, finishing fifth in the 200607 season. Under Moyes's 11-year managership, the club prospered, qualifying for the Champions League in 2005 and reaching the FA Cup final in 2009. However, the long-awaited trophy that his leadership deserved eluded him. Having stalled on contract renewal discussions, and following the announcement of Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement as manager of Manchester United {{at the end of the}} 2013 season, Moyes succeeded him at Old Trafford.|$|E
