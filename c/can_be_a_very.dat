5|$|Inquisitive and bold, {{especially}} {{in the presence of}} food, the silvertip shark is regarded as potentially dangerous to humans. Often, several Silvertip sharks will rush up from deep water to inspect divers when they first enter the water, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> intimidating experience, as the sharks may approach quite close. This species has also been known to circle or pursue divers. In one experiment involving bait, a large silvertip shark tore the leg off a dummy dressed in SCUBA gear, demonstrating that this species is capable of inflicting lethal injuries. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File listed four provoked attacks attributable to this species, none of them fatal.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{occurs on}} dry land, but the females {{return to the}} edge of the sea to release their fertilised eggs and then retreat back up the beach. The larvae that hatch are planktonic for 3–4 weeks, before {{settling}} to the sea floor, entering a gastropod shell and returning to dry land. Sexual maturity is reached after about 5 years, and the total lifespan may be over 60 years. In the 3–4 weeks that the larvae remain in the sea their chance of reaching another suitable location will be enhanced if they find a floating life support system. It is commonly agreed that floating logs or rafts of storm-struck vegetation would be suitable, although rather chancy and definitely seasonal. In contrast, floating coconuts <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> significant part of the crab's dispersal options.|$|E
25|$|Being {{suspended}} {{upside down}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> hard position to maintain {{as a result}} of the position causing the blood to rush to the head. This means that this position probably cannot be maintained for any length of time and can even lead to the person blacking out. To be suspended in this position, ropes or suspension cuffs are used to lift the person into the air by their ankles.|$|E

25|$|Chenin blanc <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{versatile}} {{player in}} food and wine pairings, but {{the wide range of}} wine styles needs to be taken into account. Lighter, dry styles can pair well with light dishes such as salads, fish, and chicken. The sweeter styles of Chenin blanc can balance the spicy heat of some Asian and Hispanic cuisines. The acidity and balance of medium-dry styles can pair well with cream sauces and rich dishes like pâté.|$|E
25|$|By {{studying}} {{the peaks of}} nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, chemists can determine the structure of many compounds. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> selective technique, distinguishing among many atoms within a molecule or collection of molecules of the same type but which differ {{only in terms of}} their local chemical environment. NMR spectroscopy is used to unambiguously identify known and novel compounds, and as such, is usually required by scientific journals for identity confirmation of synthesized new compounds. See the articles on carbon-13 NMR and proton NMR for detailed discussions.|$|E
25|$|To prevent electrocution, RCDs should {{operate within}} 25–40 {{milliseconds}} with any leakage currents (through a person) of greater than 30 mA, before electric shock can drive the heart into ventricular fibrillation, {{the most common}} cause of death through electric shock. By contrast, conventional circuit breakers or fuses only break the circuit when the total current is excessive (which may be thousands of times the leakage current an RCD responds to). A small leakage current, such as through a person, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> serious fault, but would probably not increase the total current enough for a fuse or circuit breaker to break the circuit, and certainly not do so fast enough to save a life.|$|E

25|$|During reverse {{electron}} transfer, complex I {{might be}} the most important site of superoxide production within mitochondria, with up to 5% of electrons being diverted to superoxide formation. Reverse electron transfer, the process by which electrons from the reduced ubiquinol pool (supplied by succinate dehydrogenase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, or dihydro-oorotate dehydrogenase in mammalian mitochondria) pass through complex I to reduce NAD+ to NADH, driven by the inner mitochondrial membrane potential electric potential. Although it is not precisely known under what pathological conditions reverse-electron transfer would occur in vivo, in vitro experiments indicate that it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> potent source of superoxide when succinate concentrations are high and oxaloacetate or malate concentrations are low.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{development}} {{entails a}} modern infrastructure (both physical and institutional), and a {{move away from}} low value added sectors such as agriculture and natural resource extraction. Developed countries, in comparison, usually have economic systems based on continuous, self-sustaining {{economic growth in the}} tertiary sector of the economy and quaternary sector of the economy and high material standards of living. However, there are notable exceptions, as some countries considered developed have a significant component of primary industries in their national economies, e.g., Norway, Canada, Australia. The USA and Western Europe have a very important agricultural sector, and are major players in international agricultural markets. Also, natural resource extraction <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> profitable industry (high value added), e.g., oil extraction.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, the bouncer <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{productive}} {{ball for}} the batsman, if he plays {{it in an}} attacking manner. The shot {{that is used to}} attack the bouncer is the hook shot. To play the hook shot the batsman moves his back foot backwards and towards the off side as the ball is being delivered. As the ball approaches, the batsman swivels from facing the off side to facing the leg side, while holding the bat horizontally. The batsman's aim is to hit the ball at high speed towards, into or over the leg side boundary. However, despite their run-scoring potential, hook shots frequently lead to wickets falling, particularly through balls hitting the top edge of the bat and being caught by leg side fielders. However, if the bouncer is misdirected by the bowler, and reaches the batsman on the off side of his wicket, the cut, uppercut or late cut can be played, either with the intention of guiding the ball along the ground, through a gap in the field setting, or over the infield for four or six.|$|E

25|$|Learning {{in early}} life is {{apparently}} important to all parrots, {{and much of}} that learning is social learning. Social interactions are often practised with siblings, and in several species, creches are formed with several broods, and these, too, are important for learning social skills. Foraging behaviour is generally learnt from parents, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> protracted affair. Suprageneralists and specialists generally become independent of their parents much quicker than partly specialised species who may have to learn skills over long periods as various resources become seasonally available. Play forms {{a large part of}} learning in parrots; it can be solitary, and related to motor skills, or social. Species may engage in play fights or wild flights to practice predator evasion. An absence of stimuli can delay the development of young birds, as demonstrated by a group of vasa parrots kept in tiny cages with domesticated chickens from the age of 3 months; at 9 months, these birds still behaved {{in the same way as}} 3-month-olds, but had adopted some chicken behaviour. In a similar fashion, captive birds in zoo collections or pets can, if deprived of stimuli, develop stereotyped behaviours and harmful behaviours like self plucking. Aviculturists working with parrots have identified the need for environmental enrichment to keep parrots stimulated.|$|E
500|$|In a {{positive}} review for The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau said Ice-T [...] "takes rap's art-ain't-life defense over the top" [...] on a heavy metal album which utilizes and parodies [...] "the style's whiteskin privilege". He {{wrote that the}} music is [...] "flat-out hard rock, short on soloistic intricacy and fancy structures", {{but that it is}} set apart from other metal by Ice-T, who [...] "describes racism in language metalheads can understand, kills several policemen, and cuts his mama into little pieces because she tells him to hate white people. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> funny record." [...] Greg Kot, writing in the Chicago Tribune, felt the lyrics on some songs are pathologically flawed and off-putting, but the band's take on metal styles is impressive and, [...] "on the stereotype-bashing 'There Goes the Neighborhood,' the humor, message and music coalesce brilliantly". Don Kaye of Kerrang! called Body Count a [...] "noisy, relentless musical attack".|$|E
